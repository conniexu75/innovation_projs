When supported by an elastomeric substrate, this “wavy” silicon can be reversibly stretched and compressed to large levels of strain without damaging the silicon. The amplitudes and periods of the waves change to accommodate these deformations, thereby avoiding substantial strains in the silicon itself. Dielectrics, patterns of dopants, electrodes, and other elements directly integrated with the silicon yield fully formed, high-performance “wavy” metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors, p-n diodes, and other devices for electronic circuits that can be stretched or compressed to similarly large levels of strain."
https://openalex.org/W2078992396,"Defining the scale of connectivity, or exchange, among marine populations and determining the factors driving this exchange are pivotal to our understanding of the population dynamics, genetic structure, and biogeography of many coastal species. Using a high-resolution biophysical model for the Caribbean region, we report that typical larval dispersal distances of ecologically relevant magnitudes are on the scale of only 10 to 100 kilometers for a variety of reef fish species. We also show the importance of the early onset of active larval movement mediating the dispersal potential. In addition to self-recruitment, larval import from outside the local area is required to sustain most populations, although these population subsidies are very limited in particular systems. The results reveal distinct regions of population isolation based on larval dispersal that also correspond to genetic and morphological clines observed across a range of marine organisms."
https://openalex.org/W2137233414,"Lighter variations of pigmentation in humans are associated with diminished number, size, and density of melanosomes, the pigmented organelles of melanocytes. Here we show that zebrafish golden mutants share these melanosomal changes and that golden encodes a putative cation exchanger slc24a5 (nckx5) that localizes to an intracellular membrane, likely the melanosome or its precursor. The human ortholog is highly similar in sequence and functional in zebrafish. The evolutionarily conserved ancestral allele of a human coding polymorphism predominates in African and East Asian populations. In contrast, the variant allele is nearly fixed in European populations, is associated with a substantial reduction in regional heterozygosity, and correlates with lighter skin pigmentation in admixed populations, suggesting a key role for the SLC24A5 gene in human pigmentation."
https://openalex.org/W1980492771,"Understanding glass formation is a challenge, because the existence of a true glass state, distinct from liquid and solid, remains elusive: Glasses are liquids that have become too viscous to flow. An old idea, as yet unproven experimentally, is that the dynamics becomes sluggish as the glass transition approaches, because increasingly larger regions of the material have to move simultaneously to allow flow. We introduce new multipoint dynamical susceptibilities to estimate quantitatively the size of these regions and provide direct experimental evidence that the glass formation of molecular liquids and colloidal suspensions is accompanied by growing dynamic correlation length scales."
https://openalex.org/W1986068618,"Aphids are associated with several facultative bacterial endosymbionts that may influence their interactions with other organisms. We show here that one of the three most common facultative symbionts of pea aphid (Acyrthosiphon pisum), the bacterium Regiella insecticola, has a major effect on host resistance to a fungal pathogen. Experimental establishment of the bacterium in uninfected aphid clones led to higher survival after fungal attack. The bacteria also increased the aphid's inclusive fitness, because the presence of the symbiont reduced the probability of fungal sporulation on aphid cadavers, hence lowering the rate of transmission of the disease to nearby related aphids."
https://openalex.org/W2082826363,"The Prader-Willi syndrome is a congenital disease that is caused by the loss of paternal gene expression from a maternally imprinted region on chromosome 15. This region contains a small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA), HBII-52, that exhibits sequence complementarity to the alternatively spliced exon Vb of the serotonin receptor 5-HT(2C)R. We found that HBII-52 regulates alternative splicing of 5-HT(2C)R by binding to a silencing element in exon Vb. Prader-Willi syndrome patients do not express HBII-52. They have different 5-HT(2C)R messenger RNA (mRNA) isoforms than healthy individuals. Our results show that a snoRNA regulates the processing of an mRNA expressed from a gene located on a different chromosome, and the results indicate that a defect in pre-mRNA processing contributes to the Prader-Willi syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W2148626564,"Microreactor technology has shown potential for optimizing synthetic efficiency, particularly in preparing sensitive compounds. We achieved the synthesis of an [ 18 F]fluoride-radiolabeled molecular imaging probe, 2-deoxy-2-[ 18 F]fluoro- d -glucose ([ 18 F]FDG), in an integrated microfluidic device. Five sequential processes—[ 18 F]fluoride concentration, water evaporation, radiofluorination, solvent exchange, and hydrolytic deprotection—proceeded with high radio-chemical yield and purity and with shorter synthesis time relative to conventional automated synthesis. Multiple doses of [ 18 F]FDG for positron emission tomography imaging studies in mice were prepared. These results, which constitute a proof of principle for automated multistep syntheses at the nanogram to microgram scale, could be generalized to a range of radiolabeled substrates."
https://openalex.org/W2092370766,"One of the most intriguing features of taste perception is its modulation by temperature. It is well known that warming enhances perceived sweetness and bitterness. In addition, around half of the human population experiences taste sensations just by changing the temperature of the tongue, a phenomenon known as ‘thermal taste’. A possible molecular explanation for these thermal effects on taste is now at hand. Activation of the receptors for sweet, bitter and umami taste in specialized cells of the tongue causes opening of the TRPM5 ion channel. This channel has now been found to be activated by heat. Direct heat activation of TRPM5 could lead to activation of taste receptors even in the absence of anything to taste. TRPM5, a cation channel of the TRP superfamily, is highly expressed in taste buds of the tongue, where it has a key role in the perception of sweet, umami and bitter tastes1,2. Activation of TRPM5 occurs downstream of the activation of G-protein-coupled taste receptors and is proposed to generate a depolarizing potential in the taste receptor cells2. Factors that modulate TRPM5 activity are therefore expected to influence taste. Here we show that TRPM5 is a highly temperature-sensitive, heat-activated channel: inward TRPM5 currents increase steeply at temperatures between 15 and 35 °C. TRPM4, a close homologue of TRPM5, shows similar temperature sensitivity. Heat activation is due to a temperature-dependent shift of the activation curve, in analogy to other thermosensitive TRP channels3. Moreover, we show that increasing temperature between 15 and 35 °C markedly enhances the gustatory nerve response to sweet compounds in wild-type but not in Trpm5 knockout mice. The strong temperature sensitivity of TRPM5 may underlie known effects of temperature on perceived taste in humans4,5,6, including enhanced sweetness perception at high temperatures and ‘thermal taste’, the phenomenon whereby heating or cooling of the tongue evoke sensations of taste in the absence of tastants7."
https://openalex.org/W2165859084,"Salt marshes in the southeastern United States have recently experienced massive die-off, one of many examples of widespread degradation in marine and coastal ecosystems. Although intense drought is thought to be the primary cause of this die-off, we found snail grazing to be a major contributing factor. Survey of marsh die-off areas in three states revealed high-density fronts of snails on die-off edges at 11 of 12 sites. Exclusion experiments demonstrated that snails actively converted marshes to exposed mudflats. Salt addition and comparative field studies suggest that drought-induced stress and grazers acted synergistically and to varying degrees to cause initial plant death. After these disturbances, snail fronts formed on die-off edges and subsequently propagated through healthy marsh, leading to cascading vegetation loss. These results, combined with model analyses, reveal strong interactions between increasing climatic stress and grazer pressure, both potentially related to human environmental impacts, which amplify the likelihood and intensity of runaway collapse in these coastal systems."

https://openalex.org/W2068120410,"Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are either ‘long and soft’, or ‘short and hard’. It is now clear that the long-duration type are caused by explosions of massive stars in distant star-forming galaxies. Only in recent months, with the Swift satellite latching onto bursts as soon as they happen, has it been possible to collect data on short bursts that may lead to similar certainty as to their cause. GRB 050724 burst onto the scene on 24 July, and has all the properties needed to solve the mystery of short GRBs. The new evidence supports the merging compact object model of short GRBs, involving either a neutron star–neutron star merger, or a neutron star–black hole binary system as progenitor. Despite a rich phenomenology, γ-ray bursts (GRBs) are divided1 into two classes based on their duration and spectral hardness—the long-soft and the short-hard bursts. The discovery of afterglow emission from long GRBs was a watershed event, pinpointing2 their origin to star-forming galaxies, and hence the death of massive stars, and indicating3 an energy release of about 1051 erg. While theoretical arguments4 suggest that short GRBs are produced in the coalescence of binary compact objects (neutron stars or black holes), the progenitors, energetics and environments of these events remain elusive despite recent5,6,7,8 localizations. Here we report the discovery of the first radio afterglow from the short burst GRB 050724, which unambiguously associates it with an elliptical galaxy at a redshift9 z = 0.257. We show that the burst is powered by the same relativistic fireball mechanism as long GRBs, with the ejecta possibly collimated in jets, but that the total energy release is 10–1,000 times smaller. More importantly, the nature of the host galaxy demonstrates that short GRBs arise from an old (> 1 Gyr) stellar population, strengthening earlier suggestions5,6 and providing support for coalescing compact object binaries as the progenitors."

https://openalex.org/W2128789238,"Two short (<2 s) g-ray bursts (GRBs) have recently been localized and fading afterglow counterparts detected. The combination of these two results left unclear the nature of the host galaxies of the bursts, because one was a star-forming dwarf, while the other was probably an elliptical galaxy. Here we report the X-ray localization of a short burst (GRB 050724) with unusual g-ray and X-ray properties. The X-ray afterglow lies off the centre of an elliptical galaxy at a redshift of z=0.258, coincident with the position determined by ground-based optical and radio observations. The low level of star formation typical for elliptical galaxies makes it unlikely that the burst originated n a supernova explosion. A supernova origin was also ruled out for GRB 050709, even though that burst took place in a galaxy with current star formation. The isotropic energy for the short bursts is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower han that for the long bursts. Our results therefore suggest that an alternative source of bursts -- the of binary systems of neutron stars or a neutron star-black hole pair -- are the progenitors of short bursts."
https://openalex.org/W2067969605,"Surface tension gives gas bubbles their perfect spherical shape by minimizing the surface area for a given volume. Here we show that gas bubbles and liquid drops can exist in stable, non-spherical shapes if the surface is covered, or 'armoured', with a close-packed monolayer of particles. When two spherical armoured bubbles are fused, jamming of the particles on the interface supports the unequal stresses that are necessary to stabilize a non-spherical shape."

https://openalex.org/W2033474018,"The local generation of active glucocorticoid by NADPH-dependent, 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (11beta-HSD1) oxoreductase activity, has emerged as an important factor in regulating hepatic glucose output and visceral adiposity. We have proposed that this NADPH is generated within the endoplasmic reticulum by the enzyme hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. To address this hypothesis, we generated mice with a targeted inactivation of the H6PD gene. These mice were unable to convert 11-dehydrocorticosterone (11-DHC) to corticosterone but demonstrated increased corticosterone to 11-DHC conversion consistent with lack of 11beta-HSD1 oxoreductase and a concomitant increase in dehydrogenase activity. This increased corticosterone clearance in the knock-out mice resulted in a reduction in circulating corticosterone levels. Our studies define the critical requirement of hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for 11beta-HSD1 oxoreductase activity and add a new dimension to the investigation of 11beta-HSD1 as a therapeutic target in patients with the metabolic syndrome."

https://openalex.org/W1681225665,"The coupled electronic and vibrational motions governing chemical processes are best viewed from the molecule's point of view-the molecular frame. Measurements made in the laboratory frame often conceal information because of the random orientations the molecule can take. We used a combination of time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, multidimensional coincidence imaging spectroscopy, and ab initio computation to trace a complete reactant-to-product pathway-the photodissociation of the nitric oxide dimer-from the molecule's point of view, on the femtosecond time scale. This method revealed an elusive photochemical process involving intermediate electronic configurations."
https://openalex.org/W2080944192,"Although membrane proteins often rely on ionizable residues for structure and function, their ionization states under physiological conditions largely elude experimental estimation. To gain insight into the effect of the local microenvironment on the proton affinity of ionizable residues, we have engineered individual lysines, histidines and arginines along the α-helical lining of the transmembrane pore of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. We can detect individual proton binding–unbinding reactions electrophysiologically at the level of a single proton on a single side chain as brief blocking–unblocking events of the passing cation current. Kinetic analysis of these fluctuations yields the position-dependent rates of proton transfer, from which the corresponding pKa values and shifts in pKa can be calculated. Here we present a self-consistent, residue-by-residue description of the microenvironment around the pore-lining transmembrane α-helices (M2) in the open-channel conformation, in terms of the excess free energy that is required to keep the engineered basic side chains protonated relative to bulk water. A comparison with closed-channel data leads us to propose that the rotation of M2, which is frequently invoked as a hallmark of the gating mechanism of Cys-loop receptors, is minimal, if any. How the protonation state of ionizable residues in proteins is modulated by the microenvironment is fundamental to many processes at the interface of biology, chemistry and physics. It is has long been recognized as an experimentally elusive, if not intractable, phenomenon. Now a new approach, combining protein engineering and single-channel patch-clamp methods, makes it possible to detect individual proton binding and unbinding events with microsecond time-resolution in muscle nicotinic receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1977060982,"Electrical synapses are common between inhibitory neurons in the mammalian thalamus and neocortex. Synaptic modulation, which allows flexibility of communication between neurons, has been studied extensively at chemical synapses, but modulation of electrical synapses in the mammalian brain has barely been examined. We found that the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, via endogenous neurotransmitter or by agonist, causes long-term reduction of electrical synapse strength between the inhibitory neurons of the rat thalamic reticular nucleus."
https://openalex.org/W2042396121,"A eukaryotic protein is often subject to regulation by multiple modifications like phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation. How these modifications are coordinated in vivo is an important issue that is poorly understood but is relevant to many biological processes. We recently showed that human MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) is sumoylated on Lys-439. Adjacent to the sumoylation motif is Ser-444, which like Lys-439 is highly conserved among MEF2 proteins from diverse species. Here we presented several lines of evidence to demonstrate that Ser-444 of MEF2D is required for sumoylation of Lys-439. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) stimulated this modification by acting through Ser-444. In addition, phosphorylation of Ser-444 by Cdk5, a cyclin-dependent kinase known to inhibit MEF2 transcriptional activity, stimulated sumoylation. Opposing the actions of HDAC4 and Cdk5, calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B) dephosphorylated Ser-444 and inhibited sumoylation of Lys-439. This phosphatase, however, exerted minimal effects on the phosphorylation catalyzed by ERK5, an extracellular signal-regulated kinase known to activate MEF2D. These results identified an essential role for Ser-444 in MEF2D sumoylation and revealed a novel mechanism by which calcineurin selectively “edits” phosphorylation at different sites, thereby reiterating that interplay between different modifications represents a general mechanism for coordinated regulation of eukaryotic protein functions in vivo.

Indeed, some of them were subsequently shown to be important for cardiac myogenesis; null mutation of the murine MEF2A or MEF2C gene led to cardiac death (3.Lin Q. Schwarz J. Bucana C. Olson E.N.

Therefore, MEF2 transcription factors are key players in diverse cellular programs.

Paradoxically, calcineurin (also known as protein phosphatase 2B or PP2B) stimulates MEF2-dependent transcription (8.Liu S. Liu P. Borras A. Chatila T. Speck S.H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 40.Chin E.R. Olson E.N. Richardson J.A. Yang Q. Humphries C. Shelton J.M. Wu H. Zhu W. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S.

Although the underlying mechanism remains to be determined, one possibility is that some phosphorylation events inhibit the activity of MEF2, and calcineurin blocks this inhibition. Related to this, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) phosphorylates Ser-444 of human MEF2D and reduces its transcriptional potential during neurotoxicity-induced apoptosis (17.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42.Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Most intriguingly, just four residues away from Ser-444 is Lys-439, whose sumoylation also serves as an inhibitory mechanism (32.Grégoire S. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 43.Zhao X. Sternsdorf T. Bolger T.A. Evans R.M. Yao T.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8456-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Both residues are highly conserved among different MEF2 proteins and form a portable repression domain (17.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 19.Tang X. Wang X. Gong X. Tong M. Park D. Xia Z. Mao Z. J.

Therefore, an interesting question to be addressed is how modifications of Lys-439 and Ser-444 are coordinated for the regulation of MEF2 function in vivo. Here we show that Ser-444 is required for sumoylation of Lys-439. By phosphorylating Ser-444, Cdk5 stimulated the sumoylation. Ser-444 was also found to be crucial for HDAC4 to stimulate the sumoylation. Moreover, HDAC4 promoted phosphorylation of MEF2. Opposing the actions of Cdk5 and HDAC4, calcineurin selectively edited phosphorylation of MEF2D to block its sumoylation. We thus conclude that phosphorylation of Ser-444 interplays with sumoylation of Lys-439 to regulate transcriptional and myogenic activities of MEF2 in a coordinated fashion. Cell Culture—HEK293 and C3H10T1/2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma), penicillin (Invitrogen), and streptomycin.

In Vivo Sumoylation Assays—For analysis of MEF2 sumoylation in vivo, HEK293 cells were lysed in buffer S (15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 0.5% SDS, 3% glycerol, 0.8× PBS, 4% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% mercaptoethanol, 25 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors) and processed as described (32.Grégoire S.

Reconstituted Sumoylation Assays—MEF2D and its point mutants K439R, S444A, and S444E were produced in the presence of [35S]methionine by use of the TnT® T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). 2 μl of 35S-labeled MEF2D or its point mutant was mixed with 0.15 μg of purified human Sae1/Sae2, 1 μg of purified human Ubc9, and 1 μg of purified human SUMO1 or SUMO3 (LAE Biotech) in the in vitro sumoylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2.5 mm ATP). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To determine the potential SUMO E3 ligase activity of HDAC4, 1.5 or 3 μl of unlabeled in vitro translated HDAC4 protein was added to the sumoylation reactions. Alternatively, the HDAC4 protein was replaced with that expressed in and purified from Sf9 cells (50.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Sumoylation reactions were stopped with an SDS sample buffer for subsequent SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—The FLAG-MEF2D expression plasmid was transfected into 4 × 105 HEK293 cells (in a 10-cm dish) with or without the expression plasmid for HA-HDAC4. 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer S. Soluble extracts were used for affinity purification on M2-agarose (Sigma). Purified proteins (8 μl in buffer S) were incubated with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Roche Applied Science) in a total volume of 20 μl of the dephosphorylation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, and 1 mm EDTA) at 37 °C for 1 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of an SDS sample buffer for subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. MEF2D Dephosphorylation by Calcineurin in Vitro—FLAG-MEF2D (5 μl), expressed in and affinity-purified from HEK293 cells as above, was incubated with 12.5 units of bovine calcineurin A/B subunits (Sigma) in 20 μl of the reaction buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) at 30 °C for 1 h. As specified, 0.3 μg of calmodulin (Sigma) and/or 0.1 mm CaCl2 was added. Reaction mixtures were stopped for separation by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting analysis with anti-FLAG and anti-phospho-Ser-444 MEF2D antibodies. The phospho-specific antibody has been described (42.Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). LiCl Treatment—To analyze effects of LiCl on MEF2 phosphorylation, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids as specified in the figure legends. 48 h post-transfection, HEK293 cells were incubated with regular media containing 20 mm LiCl for 6 h and then lysed in buffer K (20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) supplemented with 20 mm LiCl. Soluble extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with an anti-FLAG M2-agarose and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. Cyclosporin A Treatment—For analysis of effects of cyclosporin A on MEF2 sumoylation, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids as specified in the figure legends. 24 h post-transfection, HEK293 cells were treated with 3.4 or 5 μm cyclosporin A for 24 h and lysed in buffer S for extract preparation. Extracts were used for immunoprecipitation with anti-MEF2D antibody conjugated to protein A-agarose or anti-FLAG M2-agarose, followed by immunoblotting with anti-SUMO2 and anti-MEF2D antibodies. Immunoprecipitation—For analysis of interaction of calcineurin with MEF2D and class IIa HDACs, an expression plasmid for HA-tagged calcineurin was transfected into HEK293 cells along with constructs expressing FLAG-tagged MEF2D or class IIa HDACs. 48 h post-transfection, cells were lysed in buffer K for extract preparation and affinity purification on M2-agarose. Purified proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies. Reporter Gene Assays—The assays were performed with the luciferase reporter Gal4-tk-luc, which contains five tandem copies of the Gal4-responsive element to drive the expression of the luciferase gene (50.Wang A.H. Bertos N.R. Vezmar M. Pelletier N. Crosato M. Heng H.H. Th'ng J. Han J. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7816-7827Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 54.Champagne N. Bertos N.R.

Briefly, 100-200 ng of this reporter was transfected into 4 × 104 HEK293 cells (in a well of a 12-well plate) using SuperFect transfection reagent (2 μl; Qiagen), along with mammalian expression plasmids for wild-type and mutant Gal4-MEF2 fusion proteins, Ubc9, HDAC4, and/or calcineurin as specified in the figure legends. As an internal control for normalization of transfection efficiency, the β-galactosidase expression plasmid CMV-β-Gal (50 ng) was cotransfected. pBluescript KSII(+) was used to supplement the plasmid mixture so that its total amount in each transfection was 1.5 μg. After 48 h, cells were lysed in situ at room temperature, and luciferase reporter activities were determined by using d-(-)-luciferin (Roche Applied Science) as the substrate. β-Galactosidase activities were determined with Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix) as the substrate. The chemiluminescence from activated luciferin or Galacto-Light Plus was measured on a luminometer plate reader (Dynex). Each transfection was performed at least three times. Myogenesis Assays—C3H10T1/2 cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells per well on glass coverslips in 12-well plates and transfected with expression plasmids as specified. Coverslips were pretreated by incubation with 0.01% polylysine (Sigma) at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator for 30 min and washed once with PBS. 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and fed with the differentiation medium (2% horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin). On day 7, coverslips were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-myosin heavy chain MF-20 antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa) to detect differentiated cells. A green fluorescent protein expression plasmid was cotransfected to normalize transfection efficiency. Critical Role of Ser-444 in Sumoylation of MEF2D—We postulated that Ser-444 of MEF2D regulates sumoylation of Lys-439 (32.Grégoire S. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). To test this hypothesis, Ser-444 was substituted with alanine to engineer the point mutant S444A, which was then subjected to in vivo sumoylation assays. For the assays, expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged wild-type MEF2D, K439R, and S444A were transfected into HEK293 cells along with an HA-SUMO2 expression construct. Cell extracts were prepared for affinity purification on anti-FLAG M2-agarose, and purified proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. As reported (32.Grégoire S. Yang X.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 2273-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), wild-type MEF2D, but not mutant K439R, was modified by SUMO2 (Fig. 1A), confirming that Lys-439 is the sumoylation site. More importantly, no sumoylation was detected with mutant S444A (lanes 3 and 6), indicating that Ser-444 is required for sumoylation of MEF2D. To substantiate this, HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for FLAG-tagged MEF2D, K439R, and S444A. These fusion proteins were affinity-purified for immunoblotting with anti-SUMO2 antibody to detect addition of endogenous SUMO2. As shown in Fig. 1B, the antibody detected sumoylated MEF2D in the protein sample affinity-purified from cell extracts expressing wild-type MEF2D but not from extracts expressing K439R or S444A, further supporting that Ser-444 is required for modification of MEF2D by SUMO2. Cdk5 is known to phosphorylate Ser-444 (17.Zhu B. Gulick T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8264-8275Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 42.Gong X. Tang X. Wiedmann M. Wang X. Peng J. Zheng D. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Mao Z. Neuron. 2003; 38: 33-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), raising the interesting possibility that the phosphorylation regulates sumoylation. To examine this, we engineered mutant S444E, in which Ser-444 was replaced by glutamic acid, to mimic phosphorylation. The corresponding expression plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells, and the sumoylation status was determined. Unlike mutant S444A (Fig. 1, A and B), S444E was sumoylated to a level similar to that of wild-type MEF2D (Fig. 1C), indicating that glutamate substitution recovers the modification. This finding also suggests that Ser-444 phosphorylation is important for sumoylation of Lys-439. To examine the modification more directly, we utilized in vitro sumoylation assays reconstituted from purified components. As shown in Fig. 1D, addition of the SUMO-activating enzyme complex Sae1/Sae2 led to specific sumoylation of MEF2D (Fig. 1D, compare lanes 1 and 2). Substitution of Lys-439 with arginine abolished the modification (Fig. 1D, lane 3). Similarly, no sumoylation was detected with mutant S444A (Fig. 1E, lanes 1 and 2). By contrast, mutant S444E was sumoylated to a level close to that of wild-type MEF2D (Fig. 1E), so changing Ser-444 from alanine to glutamic acid also restored the modification in vitro. These results support that Ser-444 is required for sumoylation and further suggest that its phosphorylation stimulates sumoylation. Stimulatory Role of Cdk5 in MEF2D Sumoylation—We next determined whether Cdk5 regulates sumoylation. For this, expression plasmids for Cdk5 and p35 (a known activator of Cdk5) were cotransfected into HEK293 cells along with expression plasmids for FLAG-MEF2D and HA-SUMO2. Modification of MEF2D by HA-SUMO2 was analyzed. As shown in Fig. 2A, Cdk5 potentiated the sumoylation. To substantiate this, we determined sumoylation of endogenous MEF2D. HEK293 cells were thus transfected with expression plasmids for Cdk5 and p35. Cell extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation with anti-MEF2D antibody, and precipitated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-MEF2D and anti-SUMO2 antibodies. Expression of Cdk5/p35 promoted SUMO2 addition to endogenous MEF2D (Fig. 2B). Treatment with roscovitine, a selective inhibitor that targets a subgroup of Cdks including Cdk5 (55.Bach S. Knockaert M.

Here we studied the mechanism underlying the HCV fusion process in vitro using liposomes and our recently described HCV pseudoparticles (pp) bearing functional E1E2 envelope glycoproteins. The fusion of HCVpp with liposomes was monitored with fluorescent probes incorporated into either the HCVpp or the liposomes. To validate these assays, pseudoparticles bearing either the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus or the amphotropic glycoprotein of murine leukemia virus were used as models for pH-dependent and pH-independent entry, respectively. The use of assays based either on fusion-induced dequenching of fluorescent probes or on reporter systems, which produce fluorescence when the virus and liposome contents are mixed, allowed us to demonstrate that HCVpp mediated a complete fusion process, leading to the merging of both membrane leaflets and to the mixing of the internal contents of pseudoparticle and liposome. This HCVpp-mediated fusion was dependent on low pH, with a threshold of 6.3 and an optimum at about 5.5. Fusion was temperature-dependent and did not require any protein or receptor at the surface of the target liposomes. Most interestingly, fusion was facilitated by the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane. These findings clearly indicate that HCV infection is mediated by a pH-dependent membrane fusion process. This paves the way for future studies of the mechanisms underlying HCV membrane fusion.

Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2001: 991-1041Google Scholar) and has infected some 170 million people world-wide (2.National Institutes of HealthHepatology. 2002; 36: S2-S20Google Scholar). In the majority of HCV-infected patients, the progression to chronic disease is associated with an increased risk of liver diseases and hepatocellular carcinoma. No vaccine is presently available, and the current treatment for chronic hepatitis C (a combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin) has a limited efficacy (3.Hnatyszyn H.J. Antivir. Ther. 2005; 10: 1-11PubMed Google Scholar). A more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of virus entry would be beneficial to the development of novel therapeutic strategies. The HCV genome is a positive-stranded RNA encoding a precursor polyprotein of about 3,000 amino acids. This polyprotein is cleaved co- and post-translationally to generate 10 viral proteins, classified into structural (capsid protein and the envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2) and nonstructural proteins (NS2 to NS5B), separated by the membrane ion channel polypeptide p7 (1.Lindenbach B.D.

However, these systems are not easy to use to study viral fusion in vitro, because of safety restrictions and because of the fact that wild type HCV particle production is tightly coupled to viral replication, a process that is very sensitive to mutations or alterations of the genomic sequence. We and others have shown previously that HCVpp, a model system for HCV cell entry based on retroviral or lentiviral core particles displaying HCV E1 and E2, closely mimic the early entry steps of the wild type virus (12.Bartosch B.

Indeed, HCVpp display a preferential tropism for hepatic cells, require the presence of both glycoproteins for activity, and can be neutralized by HCV patient sera. Furthermore, HCVpp offer technical flexibility, which we have exploited in our fusion studies by incorporating different glycoproteins, labeled probes, and marker genes into the viral core particles. Over the last 15 years, a number of different approaches have implicated several molecules in HCV cell attachment or fusion. HCV has been shown to interact with C-type lectins L-SIGN and DC-SIGN, and it was proposed that the virus may utilize these interactions to cross the liver epithelium to access hepatocytes (20.Cormier E.G.

We and others have shown that HCV entry occurs in a pH-dependent manner via endocytosis, as was shown for other Flaviviridae. Indeed, the use of drugs that inhibit endosomal acidification efficiently blocked HCVpp infection (12.Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar, 13.Hsu M. Zhang J. Flint M. Logvinoff C. Cheng-Mayer C. Rice C.M. McKeating J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Foung S. Cosset F.L. Dubuisson J. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 2994-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), supporting the notion that low pH induces conformational rearrangements in HCV glycoproteins, eventually leading to fusion with the endosome membrane. This would be consistent with a membrane fusion mechanism similar to that described for the glycoproteins of Flaviviruses, such as tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) (29.Corver J. Ortiz A.

In the Flaviviridae family, it is known that low pH triggers glycoprotein conformational changes, leading to the formation of a fusion-competent trimer, in which the fusion peptide becomes exposed and inserts into the target (endosomal) membrane to initiate fusion. This process has been described for Flaviviruses such as TBEV (33.Stiasny K. Koessl C. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 7856-7862Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to be enhanced by the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane. Cholesterol has also been reported to enhance entry, but not the fusion process itself, of many other pH-dependent viruses (29.Corver J. Ortiz A. Allison S.L. Schalich J. Heinz F.X. Wilschut J. Virology. 2000; 269: 37-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, for alphaviruses such as the Semliki Forest (SFV) and Sindbis viruses, the presence of cholesterol in the target membrane is an absolute requirement for fusion to occur (35.White J. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3273-3277Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 36.Justman J. Klimjack M.R. Kielian M. J.

In this study, we investigated the membrane fusion properties of HCVpp bearing functional E1 and E2 HCV glycoproteins, with respect to pH, temperature, viral dose, and the presence of cholesterol. We used a liposomal membrane system, composed of phosphatidylcholine (PC) liposomes with or without cholesterol and fluorescent probes (R18, CCF2) incorporated into either the particles or the liposomes. We demonstrated that HCVpp-mediated membrane fusion is a full fusion mechanism, leading to both lipid mixing and contents mixing of HCVpp and liposome. The fusion is dependent on the presence of E1 and E2 glycoproteins, is temperature-dependent, occurs optimally at low pH (about 5.5), and does not require the presence of a protein or carbohydrate receptor in the target membrane. Although HCVpp-mediated fusion does not strictly rely on the presence of cholesterol, it is facilitated by its presence in the target membrane. Phosphatidylcholine from egg yolk (99% pure), cholesterol (chol, 99% pure), and Triton X-100 were from Sigma. Phospholipid oxidation was routinely checked by spectrophotometry. Octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (R18) was from Molecular Probes, and CCF2 (CCF2-FA; free acid form) was purchased from Invitrogen. All liposomes were large unilamellar vesicles (100 or 400 nm), consisting of PC or PC:chol (70:30 molar ratio). R18-labeled liposomes were obtained by mixing R18 and lipids as ethanol and chloroform solutions, respectively (5 mol % R18 final (40.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar)), and liposomes were prepared by extrusion over polycarbonate filters in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 (41.Otter-Nilsson M. Hendriks R. Pécheur-Huet E.I. Hoekstra D. Nilsson T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 2074-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CCF2-loaded liposomes were obtained by resuspending the lipid film into a 100 μm CCF2-FA solution in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5; unencapsulated CCF2 was removed by gel filtration over a PD-10 column. The CMV-Gag-Pol murine leukemia virus (MLV) packaging construct, encoding the MLV gag and pol genes, and the MLV-GFP plasmid, encoding an MLV-based transfer vector containing a CMV-GFP internal transcriptional unit, were described previously (12.Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar).

Valsesia-Wittmann S. Russell S.J. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 5313-5317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and NA expression vectors encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase of fowl plague virus, respectively. The phCMV-MLV-A vector encodes the envelope glycoprotein Env of the amphotropic MLV (43.Sandrin V. Boson B. Salmon P. Gay W. Negre D. Le Grand R. Trono D. Cosset F.L. Blood. 2002; 100: 823-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The phCMV-E1E2-HCV (12.Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar) encodes both HCV E1 and E2 glycoproteins of genotype 1a, strain H77 (AF009606). Pseudoparticles were generated as described previously (12.Bartosch B. Dubuisson J. Cosset F.L. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 197: 633-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (944) Google Scholar). Briefly, 293T cells were transfected using a calcium phosphate-based transfection kit with three expression vectors encoding an envelope glycoprotein, viral core components, and a viral genome displaying a green fluorescent protein marker gene. Particles produced without any envelope expression construct, and consequently not infectious, were denoted “no env pp.” To incorporate specifically β-lactamase (BlaM) into HIV-based particles, a chimeric protein encoding BlaM linked to the N terminus of the HIV-1 viral protein R (Vpr) was co-expressed with the other HIV viral vectors (44.Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 45.Yonezawa A. Cavrois M. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cell supernatants containing pseudoparticles were harvested 36 h after transfection and concentrated 100-fold by centrifugation through 2 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion at 100,000 × g in a Beckman SW 41 rotor for 120 min at 4 °C, followed by resuspension in PBS. Infectious titers of the concentrated supernatants were then determined by infection of Huh7 cells followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The titers of the different concentrated pseudo-particle preparations were ∼2 × 106 IU/ml, 3 × 108 IU/ml, and 5 × 108 IU/ml for HCVpp, MLVpp, and HApp, respectively. Viral pellets and cell lysates of viral producer cells were subjected to immunoblot analysis using a mouse anti-HCV E2 (H52 (46.Flint M. Maidens C. Loomis-Price L.D. Shotton C. Dubuisson J. Monk P. Higginbottom A. Levy S. McKeating J.A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 6235-6244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), a mouse anti-HCV E1 (A4 (47.Dubuisson J. Hsu H.H. Cheung R.C. Greenberg H.B. Russell D.G. Rice C.M. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 6147-6160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), and a goat anti-glycoprotein 70 (MLV-A SU) serum (ViroMed Biosafety Laboratories, Camden, NJ). HA was detected with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA H7 strain antibody (anti-Kp-Ro Rostock cl96-11, kindly provided by W. Garten, Marburg, Germany). To compare the amounts of viruses, the blots were probed with antibodies against the capsid proteins of HIV and MLV as follows: the mouse anti-p24 of HIV (antibody AG3.0, obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, from Dr. Jonathan Allan) and the anti-p30 of MLV (goat antiserum raised against the Rauscher-MuLV p30; ViroMed). Monoclonal anti-β-lactamase antibody was from Chemicon International (AB3738), and the rabbit polyclonal anti-Vpr antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Warner Greene (45.Yonezawa A. Cavrois M. Greene W.C. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 918-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Lipid Mixing—R18 was incorporated into either the liposomes or the pseudoparticles at self-quenching concentrations (40.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Unincorporated R18 was removed by pelleting the pseudoparticles for 1 h at 100,000 × g and 4 °C in a Beckman SW 41 rotor. Lipid mixing between pseudoparticles and liposomes was monitored as the dequenching of R18. Briefly, R18-labeled liposomes (final lipid concentration, 15 μm) were added to a 37 °C-thermostated cuvette containing pseudoparticles in PBS, pH 7.4. After temperature equilibration, fusion kinetics were recorded on an SLM Aminco 8000 spectrofluorimeter, over a 30-min time period, at λexc = 560 nm and λem = 590 nm. Maximal R18 dequenching was measured after the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100 (final concentration) to the cuvette. The same procedure was used for lipid mixing assays with R18-labeled pseudoparticles (2 nmol of R18 per 100 μl of particles) and unlabeled liposomes (15 μm). The initial rates of fusion were taken as the value of the slope of the tangent, drawn to the steepest part of the fusion kinetics. Internal Contents Mixing—This assay is based upon the cleavage of a fluorogenic substrate, CCF2 (encapsulated into liposomes) by β-lactamase, where BlaM is incorporated into viral core particles in the form of a BlaM-Vpr chimera (44.Cavrois M. De Noronha C. Greene W.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 1151-1154Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and CCF2 is incorporated in the lumen of liposomes. CCF2 is a cephalosporin-derived molecule bearing coumarin-derived and fluorescein moieties in close proximity, because of their association with the β-lactam ring (48.Zlokarnik G. Negulescu P.A. Knapp T.E. Mere L. Burres N. Feng L. Whitney M. Roemer K. Tsien R.Y. Science. 1998; 279: 84-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In CCF2, the absorption spectrum of the fluorescence acceptor (fluorescein) and the emission spectrum of the donor (coumarin) overlap. In this configuration an efficient internal fluorescence resonance energy transfer reaction takes place, and the acceptor fluorescence can be observed at 520 nm. When the enzyme BlaM cleaves the β-lactam ring of CCF2, the coumarin moiety is relieved from the internal fluorescence resonance energy transfer, and its fluorescence increases at 450 nm, whereas fluorescein fluorescence decreases at 520 nm. When aqueous liposome and pseudoparticle contents coalesce as a result of fusion, β-lactamase cleaves CCF2 into a nonfluorescent fluorescein-derived moiety and a fluorescent coumarin-based moiety exhibiting a λexc of 409 nm and a λem of 450 nm. The final concentration of CCF2 used in the assay was 25 μm, and the total lipid concentration was 150 μm. Contents mixing was visualized both by recording the emission spectra of CCF2 between 420 and 560 nm (λexc = 409 nm) and by monitoring the increase of coumarin fluorescence kinetically at λexc = 409 nm and λem = 450 nm. Fusion of HCVpp with Liposomes Assessed by Lipid Mixing—Fusion of a virus with the membrane of its target cell implies initial destabilization of viral and cellular membranes, which leads to mixing of viral and cellular lipids (lipid mixing) and ultimately to the formation of a pore connecting the viral and cellular internal compartments (contents mixing). To assess the lipid mixing properties of HCVpp, we deployed two assays based upon rhodamine (R18) fluorescence dequenching, a well documented test for viral fusion (40.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). We incorporated R18 into pseudoparticles or liposomes at a surface density to which the probe is efficiently self-quenched. Upon mixing of membranes containing self-quenched R18 with membranes devoid of the fluorophore, the dilution of the probe results in dequenching, which is directly proportional to the ratio of R18 to total lipid. Thus lipid mixing can be followed kinetically by measuring the R18 increase in fluorescence over time. Moreover, the fluorescence yield of R18 is not sensitive to pH changes of the surrounding solvent and makes it suitable for membrane fusion studies over a large pH range (40.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). The first approach used R18-labeled pseudoparticles. To control the input of the different types of pseudoparticles in the fusion experiments, we normalized our assays by estimating the amount of MLV core protein (p30) in each viral preparation by immunoblotting concentrated viral supernatants with an anti-p30 antibody. Fig. 1A shows that the amount of core used in the assays was similar for all pseudoparticle preparations assayed in fusion (top panel). Immunoblot analyses of the glycoproteins (Fig. 1A, bottom panels) showed that the appropriate glycoproteins were present in each viral preparation. For the lipid mixing reaction, PC liposomes were prepared by extrusion through a 100-nm pore, a diameter comparable with that of the pseudoparticles (49.Sandrin V. Boulanger P. Penin F. Granier C. Cosset F.L. Bartosch B. J. Gen. Virol. 2005; 86: 3189-3199Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Upon the addition of R18-labeled HCVpp to unlabeled liposomes, R18 dequenching was observed only when the pH was decreased to 5.0 (Fig. 1B, HCVpp). At pH 7.4 (Fig. 1C, curve a), even after long incubation times, no significant dequenching could be detected. HCVpp behaved similarly to HApp bearing the hemagglutinin of the influenza fowl plague virus, a well known prototype for a strictly low pH-dependent fusion protein. Indeed as illustrated in Fig. 1B (representative curves of five experiments), a rapid fluorescence dequenching was observed for HApp when the pH was decreased to 5.0, whereas no fluorescence variations occurred at pH 7.4 (Fig. 1C, curve b). This strictly pH-dependent HApp-mediated lipid mixing was comparable with reported data on the fusion of the wild type influenza virus with liposomes (40.Hoekstra D. de Boer T. Klappe K. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5675-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar, 50.Stegmann T. Hoekstra D. Scherphof G. Wilschut J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3107-3113Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The kinetics of HApp lipid mixing are reproducibly biphasic, exhibiting a very rapid initial rate that might be due to a higher intrinsic fusogenicity of HApp compared with HCVpp. Control pseudoparticles devoid of viral glycoprotein (Fig. 1B, no env pp) or pseudoparticles bearing the amphotropic murine leukemia virus MLV glycoprotein (MLVpp), a receptor-dependent and pH-independent glycoprotein (51.Lavillette D. Maurice M. Roche C. Russell S.J. Sitbon M. Cosset F.L. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9955-9965Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), did not display any lipid mixing at any pH and any amount of pseudoparticle tested (Fig. 1C, curve c and data not shown). This demonstrates that lipid mixing was specifically induced by the HCV and HA glycoproteins in a pH-dependent manner and occurred in the absence of receptor on the target liposomes. To confirm these data, we performed similar lipid mixing experiments using liposomes labeled with R18 at self-quenching concentrations and with unlabeled pseudoparticles. When R18-labeled liposomes were added to pseudoparticles, rapid dequenching was again observed for HCVpp and HApp, only at pH 5.0, but not at all for MLVpp or no env pp (Fig. 1D, representative curves of five experiments). Note however that the kinetics of lipid mixing appears to be slowed down under those conditions when compared with the kinetics recorded with R18-labeled pseudoparticles (Fig. 1B). This could be due to different amounts"

Although Plateosaurus grew at the fast rates typical for dinosaurs, as indicated by fibrolamellar bone, qualitative (growth stop) and quantitative (growth-mark counts) features of its histology are poorly correlated with body size.

https://openalex.org/W2010019056,"It is important to know how different organs 'manage' their stem cells. Both hair and feather follicles show robust regenerative powers that episodically renew the epithelial organ. However, the evolution of feathers (from reptiles to birds) and hairs (from reptiles to mammals) are independent events and their follicular structures result from convergent evolution. Because feathers do not have the anatomical equivalent of a hair follicle bulge, we are interested in determining where their stem cells are localized. By applying long-term label retention, transplantation and DiI tracing to map stem cell activities, here we show that feather follicles contain slow-cycling long-term label-retaining cells (LRCs), transient amplifying cells and differentiating keratinocytes. Each population, located in anatomically distinct regions, undergoes dynamic homeostasis during the feather cycle. In the growing follicle, LRCs are enriched in a 'collar bulge' niche. In the moulting follicle, LRCs shift to populate a papillar ectoderm niche near the dermal papilla. On transplantation, LRCs show multipotentiality. In a three-dimensional view, LRCs are configured as a ring that is horizontally placed in radially symmetric feathers but tilted in bilaterally symmetric feathers. The changing topology of stem cell activities may contribute to the construction of complex feather forms."

Here, we report a complete numerical solution of the Schrödinger equation for the double photoionization of H 2 . The results suggest that the distribution of photoelectrons emitted from aligned molecules reflects electron correlation effects that are purely molecular in origin."

We have investigated the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton directly binds to the carboxyl terminus of α-ENaC using a combination of confocal microscopy, co-immunoprecipitation, and protein binding studies. Confocal microscopy of Madin-Darby canine kidney cell monolayers stably transfected with wild type, rat isoforms of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC revealed co-localization of α-ENaC with the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton both at the apical membrane and within the subapical cytoplasm. F-actin was found to co-immunoprecipitate with α-ENaC from whole cell lysates of this cell line. Gel overlay assays demonstrated that F-actin specifically binds to the carboxyl terminus of α-ENaC. A direct interaction between F-actin and the COOH terminus of α-ENaC was further corroborated by F-actin co-sedimentation studies. This is the first study to report a direct and specific biochemical interaction between F-actin and ENaC.

The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) 2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody.2The abbreviations used are: ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; WGA, wheat germ agglutinin; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; GST, glutathione S-transferase; mAb, monoclonal antibody. is a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel superfamily of ion channels. ENaC is expressed at the apical surface of polarized epithelia and is in part responsible for maintaining proper salt and water homeostasis in the body. A great deal of information is known about the biophysical properties of ENaC once it is inserted into the apical surface of an epithelial cell plasma membrane. However, less is known about the proteins that interact with ENaC. Data from the literature indicate an interaction between ENaC and components of the apical membrane cytoskeleton. A partially purified ENaC complex from bovine renal epithelia copurifies with ankyrin, spectrin, and actin (1Smith P.R. Saccomani G. Joe E.H. Angelides K.J. Benos D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6971-6975Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), suggesting that these cytoskeletal proteins may be associated with ENaC. In addition, α-rENaC has been shown to bind to α-spectrin, and this is mediated through direct interaction between the α-spectrin Src homology 3 domain and the second proline-rich region in the COOH terminus of α-rENaC (2Rotin D. Bar-Sagi D. O'Brodovich H. Merilainen J. Lehto V.P. Canessa C.M. Rossier B.C. Downey G.P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4440-4450Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Electrophysiological data provide further support for an interaction between ENaC and the actin-based cytoskeleton. In cell-attached patches of A6 renal epithelial cells treated with the actin filament disrupter cytochalasin D, an induction of ENaC activity was observed (3Cantiello H.F. Stow J.L. Prat A.G. Ausiello D.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C882-C888Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), thereby suggesting that changes in the actin cytoskeleton affect the activity of ENaC. ENaC activation was also observed when short F-actin filaments were added to excised patches, and this effect was increased with the addition of cytochalasin D and/or ATP. These effects were reversed by the addition of the G-actin binding protein, DNase I. In planar lipid bilayers, short F-actin filaments were demonstrated to increase the open probability of rENaC (4Berdiev B.K. Prat A.G. Cantiello H.F. Ausiello D.A. Fuller C.M. Jovov B. Benos D.J. Ismailov I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17704-17710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), whereas application of DNase I prevented the activation of rENaC. The application of gelsolin, a Ca2+-activated protein that severs actin filaments and caps the plus end of the actin filament, preventing the repolymerization of actin and keeping it in a gel-like state, was found to cause a sustained activation of rENaC. In addition, actin was required for the transient activation of rENaC by protein kinase A and ATP when ENaC was reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. These data indicate that a direct interaction between actin and ENaC may underlie the regulation of ENaC by short actin filaments. Identification of regions involved in a direct protein interaction between actin and α-ENaC has only been deduced from biophysical methods. Current evidence suggests that actin interacts with the C-terminal domain of α-ENaC. A C-terminal truncation mutant (R613X) of α-rENaC was not responsive to the addition of actin. The single channel recordings of the αR613Xβγ-rENaC treated with actin were the same as wild type αβγ-rENaC that was not treated with actin (5Jovov B. Tousson A. Ji H.L. Keeton D. Shlyonsky V.

The deletion of 14 amino acids, Glu631-Phe644,in a chimeric rat-bovine α-ENaC (α-rbENaC), consisting of α-rENaC residues 1-615 and α-bENaC residues 570-650, nullified the effect of actin normally seen with the chimeric α-bENaC (6Copeland S.J. Berdiev B.K. Ji H.L. Lockhart J. Parker S. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C231-C240Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The deleted 14-amino acid sequence of α-bENaC has an 11-amino acid sequence identity to the same region of amino acids in the COOH terminus of α-rENaC. This high degree of sequence identity suggests that this amino acid sequence in α-rENaC may also participate in the regulation of ENaC by actin. However, to date, there is no definitive biochemical evidence for a direct interaction between F-actin and α-ENaC. In order to investigate the hypothesis that the actin cytoskeleton interacts directly with the carboxyl terminus of α-ENaC, we have used a combination of gel overlay and F-actin co-sedimentation assays to demonstrate binding of actin to the COOH terminus of α-ENaC. Actin was found to co-immunoprecipitate with α-ENaC from MDCK cell lysates, thereby providing in vivo data supporting an association between actin and ENaC. Moreover, co-localization of actin and α-ENaC in the apical membrane of MDCK cells stably expressing functional ENaC was demonstrated using laser-scanning confocal microscopy. These three independent lines of evidence support an interaction between actin and α-ENaC, which is mediated by the direct binding of actin to the carboxyl terminus of α-ENaC. Cell Culture—Stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the rat isoforms of αβγ-ENaC and MDCK parental cells were obtained as a kind gift from Drs. R. G. Morris and J. A. Schafer. The α-rENaC subunit was tagged with a single FLAG tag in the extracellular loop as described by Firsov et al. (7Firsov D. Schild L. Gautschi I. Merillat A.M. Schneeberger E. Rossier B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15370-15375Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar); both β- and γ-subunits were wild type. Cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator. Cells were initially grown in T75 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and antibiotics (penicillin and streptomycin (1%), G418 (800 μg/ml), hygromycin (300 μg/ml), and puromycin (5 μg/ml)). Once the cells were at least 80% confluent, cells were seeded on poly-l-lysine-coated semipermeable supports (Transwell; 24-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size; Costar). Cells were used ∼5-14 days later when polarized monolayers were formed. MDCK cells used for Western blots and co-immunoprecipitations were plated in 100-mm plastic Petri dishes. In some experiments, in order to increase ENaC expression, the media were supplemented with 2 μm dexamethasone (Sigma) and 2 mm sodium butyrate (Fluka) 24 h before the cells were harvested. Electrophysiology—Whole cell clamp bath solution was RPMI culture medium. The pipette solution was 100 mm potassium gluconate, 30 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EGTA, free Ca2+ less than 10 nm, 4 mm ATP, at a pH of 7.2. The bath contained serum-free RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (133 mm Na+, 5.3 mm K+, 108.3 mm Cl-). These solutions approximate normal ionic gradients in situ. After formation of a gigaohm seal, the membrane within the seal was ruptured by an additional suction pulse. The whole-cell configuration was confirmed by an increase in the capacitance with no change in resistance. After the additional capacitance was balanced, the cells were held at -60 mV and clamped to membrane potentials ranging from -160 to +40 mV sequentially for 1 s, returning to the holding potential (-60 mV) for 1 s between each test voltage. Currents were recorded digitally using pClamp hardware and software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). During bath perfusion to change to amiloride-supplemented medium, the cells were held at -60 mV and pulsed sequentially to -120 and +60 mV for 0.5 s, returning to the holding potential between each test pulse (see Fig. 1C). This provided a continuous record and shows in real time the inhibition of inward current by amiloride. Single channel currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique. For cell-attached patches the pipette solution was RPMI culture medium, and for outside-out patches the pipette solution was 150 mm KCl. In all cases, the bath solution was RPMI culture medium. Data were recorded and analyzed using fetchex, fetchan, and pstat software (Axon Instruments, Sunnyvale, CA). Immunocytochemistry—MDCK cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated semipermeable supports as described above. Culture medium was aspirated from the monolayer, cells were rinsed twice with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (137 mm NaCl, 27.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mm KH2PO4, 8 mm Na2HPO4), and monolayers were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (prepared from 20% EM Grade solution; Electron Microscopy Services) for 15 min at 37 °C. Cells were rinsed three times with 1× PBS and then permeabilized using 1× PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 (PBST) for 5 min at room temperature. The blocking step was done with 1× PBS plus 10% normal serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The wheat germ agglutinin/Alexa594 conjugate (WGA594) (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used at a concentration of 5 μg/ml diluted in 1× PBS and incubated with the samples for 10 min at room temperature. The anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Stratagene) was diluted 1:100 with 1× PBST from a stock concentration of 2 mg/ml with 1× PBST and incubated with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. Specificity of the anti-FLAG M2 antibody was demonstrated using the FLAG peptide (Sigma). The antibody was preabsorbed with the FLAG peptide, 10 μg of peptide, 1 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody for a minimum of 15 h prior to use. All phalloidin conjugates (Molecular Probes) were diluted 1:100 with 1× PBST from a stock concentration of ∼6.6 μm and incubated with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. Monolayers were then washed with 1× PBS, three times for 10 min at room temperature. Secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa488 or Alexa594 (Molecular Probes) was diluted 1:100 with 1× PBST from a stock of 2 mg/ml and incubated with sample for 1 h at room temperature. After application of primary/probe and secondary antibody, samples were washed in 1× PBS three times for 10 min each at room temperature. Counterstaining was performed using Hoechst 33258 (20 μg/mlin1× PBS) for 3-5 min at room temperature. Cells were rinsed once with 1× PBS. Monolayers were mounted with 1% para-phenylenediamine in 1:9 (v/v) 1× PBS/glycerol and coverslipped. Images were viewed using laser-scanning confocal microscopy (Leica DM IRBE microscope, mounted with a Leica TCS SP scanhead). The Leica DM IRBE microscope was equipped with oil, PlanApochromat 40×, 63×, and 100× objectives. The 100× objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 was used to acquire the final images. Visualization of blue fluorophores (Hoechst 33258) was achieved by using a dedicated UV laser (Coherent) for excitation at 350 nm. Green fluorophore (Alexa488) excitation at 488 nm was achieved by using an argon laser (Leica). Red fluorophore (Alexa 594) excitation at 568 nm was achieved by using a krypton laser (Leica). Energy emission in the form of light by blue fluorophores (380-494 nm), green fluorophores (500-575 nm), and red fluorophores (596-722 nm) was detected using three independent photomultiplier tubes. Color channels for the final double label images were captured sequentially and then merged using the Leica TCS NT software. Adobe Photoshop version 7.0 was used for image processing. All confocal microscopy was done at the University of Alabama High Resolution Imaging Facility and the Veterans Affairs Hospital (Birmingham, AL). SDS-PAGE, Immunoprecipitations/Co-immunoprecipitations, and Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates prepared from MDCK cells stably expressing ENaC and MDCK parental cells were used. Cells were grown in three 100-mm plastic Petri dishes until confluent. Cells were washed twice with 2 ml of cold 1× PBS. Petri dishes were placed on ice for 10 min with 1 ml each of 1× lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were scraped from the Petri dishes and placed into microcentrifuge tubes on ice. Lysates were sheared a minimum of three times with a 22-gauge needle, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Sheared lysates were then spun at 15,800 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The supernatant was removed, and a BCA protein assay (Pierce) was performed to quantify the amount of total protein in the samples. A maximum of 200 μg of whole cell lysate diluted in 1× PBS was used per immunoprecipitation reaction and incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotator with 3 μg of anti-FLAG mAb (Stratagene), 40 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-agarose beads (Roche Applied Science) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (final volume of 500 μl). After overnight incubation, beads were centrifuged for 2 min at 15,800 × g. The supernatant was aspirated, and beads were washed and pelleted three times (2 min at 15,800 × g) in 1× lysis buffer supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Samples were diluted 1:1 (v/v) with Laemmli sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 5% β-mercaptoethanol), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE with constant voltage at room temperature. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Bio-Rad). The Western transfer was done in running buffer (25 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 192 mm glycine, 1% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) methanol) at 4 °C for 1 h at constant voltage. Blots were either blocked in 1× TBST (10 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C or for 1 h at room temperature. Following immunoprecipitation with the mAb anti-FLAG antibody, Western blot detection of α-rENaC was performed using anti-FLAG mAb (1:500 dilution) or a rabbit polyclonal anti-α-ENaC antibody (2 μg/ml final concentration) (Affinity BioReagents). Specificity of the anti-α-ENaC antibody was demonstrated using its immunizing peptide (Affinity BioReagents). The antibody was preabsorbed with its immunizing peptide 2 μg peptide/1 μg of α-ENaC antibody for a minimum of 15 h prior to use. Primary antibodies were diluted with 1× TBST, 1% nonfat dry milk and incubated with blots for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed a minimum of 3 times with 1× TBST, 10 min each at room temperature. Secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used at dilutions of 1:10,000 or 1:20,000 in 1× TBST and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed a minimum of three times with 1× TBST, 10 min each at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Super Signal West Pico; Pierce) and imaged onto Eastman Kodak Co. X-OMAT AR film (Fisher). Controls for immunoprecipitations consisted of ChromPure normal IgG serum (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) added in a concentration equivalent to the primary antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation of α-rENaC with actin was performed as above with the following exceptions: 1) the lysis buffer used contained 50 mm Tris base, 15 mm Na2HPO4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, pH 7.41; 2) following the BCA assay, the 200 μg of supernatant was precleared with 50 μl of protein A-agarose beads and 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads for 2 h at 4°C; 3) after preclearing, the samples were spun, and the anti-FLAG antibody alone was added for overnight incubation at 4 °C; 4) the α-rENaC/FLAG complex was captured by the addition of 40 μl of protein G-agarose and incubated for 2 h at 4°C;5) the beads were washed three times with the lysis buffer plus 500 mm KCl, pH 9.1; 6) the co-immunoprecipitation control consisted of an anti-His antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) added in a concentration equivalent to that of the primary anti-FLAG antibody. The monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Chemicon) was used at a 1:1,500 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblotting and primary antibody detection for the co-immunoprecipitations was done exactly as described above. Construction of GST-ENaC Fusion Constructs—PCR amplification of the γ-rENaC COOH terminus (amino acids Ala563-Ile650, bp 1,785-2,051), the α-rENaC NH2 terminus (amino acids Met1-Asn90, bp 82-351), and the α-rENaC COOH terminus (amino acids Arg613-Leu698, bp 1,918-2,178) consisted of using full-length α- and γ-rENaC cDNAs (a kind gift of Dr. B. Rossier, Lausanne, Switzerland). The PCR (50-μl total volume) consisted of 5 μlof10× buffer, 0.8 μl of Mg2+ (1.5 mm), 1 μl of dNTP (25 mm/nucleotide), 1 μl of primer (15 pmol/primer), 100 ng of DNA template, and 0.5 μl of native Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels (NuSeive 3:1 agarose) for gel purification (Qiagen). After purification, the insert was subcloned into the pCR4.0 TOPO-TA vector (Invitrogen) and transformed into chemically competent TOP10 Escherichia coli (Invitrogen). Transformed bacteria were grown overnight at 37 °C on LB/ampicillin plates. Positive clones were screened by restriction enzyme digestion and grown up overnight again, and the plasmid DNA was isolated (Promega). Following confirmation by sequencing, the amplified cDNA was excised from the pCR4.0 vector and ligated into linearized pGEX 5X-1 GST expression vector (AP Biotech). The ligation products were then transformed into the JM109 maintenance strain (Promega), plated overnight, and screened for positive clones by restriction enzyme digestion. DNA from positive clones was isolated (Qiagen), sequenced, and then transformed into E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene) cells for the production of GST fusion proteins. Generation and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-α-hENaC C-terminal fusion protein (a generous gift of Dr. F. J. McDonald, Dunedin, New Zealand), GST-γ-rENaC C-terminal, GST-α-rENaC NH2-terminal, and GST were produced in E. coli BL21-CodonPlus-RP (Stratagene). Cells were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Bacterial cultures were spun at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Bacterial pellets were snap frozen with liquid N2 and stored overnight at -80 °C. Pellets were lysed with BugBuster (Novagen) in the presence of benzonase (Novagen) and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 20 min at room temperature or at 4 °C for 45 min and then spun at 16,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Supernatant was poured over a glutathione-Sepharose 4B (AP Biotech) gravity flow column five times. Bound GST fusion protein or GST was eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione (Sigma) in three 2-ml fractions. The purified fractions were assayed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Gel Code (Pierce). The fractions were then pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed overnight at 4 °C in 1× PBS with three buffer changes. Labeling and Polymerization of Nonmuscle Actin—Nonmuscle actin (Cytoskeleton) was labeled with Alexa Fluor 488 carboxylic acid succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer. The polymerization of the nonmuscle actin was done as previously described by Hitt et al. (8Hitt A.L. Laing S.D. Olson S. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Gel Overlays—Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and separated using 12% Tris/glycine gels with constant voltage at room temperature. Proteins were transferred onto PVDF membrane in running buffer (25 mm Tris base, pH 8.0, 192 mm glycine, 20% (v/v) methanol) at 4 °C for 1 h at constant voltage. Gel overlays were blocked in 1× TBST, 5% nonfat dry milk overnight at 4 °C. The blots were probed with 25 μg/ml F-actin/Alexa488 in 1× TBST, 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature, washed briefly in 1× TBST, allowed to air-dry, and scanned using a FujiFilm FLA-5100 Scanner (FujiFilm). Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop 7.0. Nonmuscle F-Actin Co-sedimentation—Nonmuscle F-actin co-sedimentation experiments were done according to the manufacturer's instructions (Cytoskeleton). All samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Briefly, 40 μl of a 23 μm nonmuscle F-actin stock was incubated with 10 μl of GST-α-hENaC C-terminal fusion protein (0.4 μg of full-length fusion protein). Negative controls consisted of 40 μl of F-actin buffer incubated with 10 μl of GST-α-hENaC C-terminal fusion protein (0.4 μg of full-length fusion protein) and an equal amount of GST protein that was used for the GST-α-hENaC C-terminal fusion protein sample. Positive controls consisted of 1 μl of α-actinin (2.5 μg), 40 μl of nonmuscle F-actin, 8 μl of F-actin buffer, and 1 μl of Tris-HCl. Following the 30-min incubation, samples were subjected to ultracentrifugation for 1.5 h, 150,000 × g at 24 °C. Supernatant was removed, and pellets were resuspended in 50 μl of Laemmli sample buffer and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal volumes of supernatant and pellet were loaded into the wells, separated using 12% Tris/glycine gels with constant voltage at room temperature. Gels were stained using GelCode (Pierce). Determination of Functional ENaC—Wild type MDCK cells do not endogenously express amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (9Ishikawa T. Marunaka Y. Rotin D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 825-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 10Morris R.G. Schafer J.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 120: 71-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MDCK cells stably transfected with rat αβγ-ENaC were examined by whole-cell patch clamp. Three stably transfected MDCK cells (induced to increase expression of ENaC) were whole-cell-clamped. Each cell had inward sodium current that was inhibited by 2 μm amiloride, thereby confirming the presence of ENaC in the plasma membrane. Fig. 1 (A and B) shows a representative example of whole-cell currents before and after treatment with amiloride. Fig. 1C shows the amiloride block in a real time pulse record. Fig. 1D is the summary of the amiloride-blockable current-voltage data. The amiloride-sensitive current reversed at a positive membrane potential, indicating sodium selectivity. Fig. 1B shows the slight reduction in outward current after amiloride treatment. This may be due to inhibition of outward potassium flux through ENaC. The result is a shift to the left in the I-V relation. In the cell-attached configuration, small single channel currents with relatively long open times were observed (Fig. 1E). Moreover, cAMP characteristically increased channel activity (NPo 0.5 versus 1.5). The single channel conductance was 8 picosiemens, which is typical of human ENaC channels (11Bubien J.K. Watson B. Khan M.A. Langloh A.L. Fuller C.M. Berdiev B. Tousson A. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8557-8566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To confirm independently the identity of the single channels, outside-out patches were formed, and amiloride (100 nm) was added to the bath solution (Fig. 1F). 100 nm is slightly above the IC50 (75 nm) for inhibition of ENaC. This concentration was chosen, because it would produce a partial inhibition of the channels, changing the long open times into rapidly transitioning channels due to the binding and unbinding of the inhibitor. Based on these observations (conductance and appropriate inhibition by amiloride), we conclude that the stably transfected MDCK cells expressed functional ENaC in their apical plasma membrane. Co-localization of α-ENaC with the Cortical F-actin Cytoskeleton—Initially, stably transfected MDCK cells expressing the α-rENaC subunit with a FLAG epitope tag on the extracellular loop and wild type β- and γ-rENaC subunits, were labeled with a monoclonal anti-FLAG epitope antibody to determine the membrane localization of α-ENaC. Fig. 2, A-E, show representative images of the pattern of expression for α-rENaC in this cell line. As these images illustrate, the level of α-rENaC expression varied between cells. Fig. 2E is a XZ reconstruction, illustrating that ENaC immunoreactivity was primarily situated in the apical domain of this cell line. In contrast to the anti-FLAG antibody, the peptide competition controls (Fig. 2, F and G) exhibited little or no detectable immunoreactivity at the surface of the monolayer (Fig. 2F) or within the cytoplasm (Fig. 2G). In order to determine where the apical anti-FLAG immunoreactivity was located relative to the apical plasma membrane, double labeling experiments were performed. Fig. 2H is an XZ reconstruction of a monolayer labeled with anti-FLAG antibody to detect α-rENaC. The monolayer was labeled with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) conjugated to Alexa594 (WGA594) prior to fixation to delineate the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 2I). Fig. 2J is an overlay of H and I, which demonstrates co-localization of α-rENaC with WGA within the apical plasma membrane. To localize the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton with respect to the apical membrane in MDCK cells stably expressing ENaC, monolayers were labeled with WGA594 and the specific F-actin probe, phalloidin, conjugated to Alexa488. Fig. 3, A-D, are optical sections from a Z-stack of MDCK ENaC cells. As the optical sections were taken deeper into the cells, the fluorescence from the WGA594 largely disappeared, leaving only the basolateral labeling of the phalloidin/Alexa488 in the majority of the field of view. An XZ reconstruction (Fig. 3, E-G) revealed co-localization of actin and WGA in some of the cells, demonstrating that a population of F-actin is associated with the apical membrane. We then performed double labeling experiments to determine whether α-rENaC and F-actin are co-localized in this model system. The representative XZ reconstructions in Fig. 4, C and F, shows the overlay of the FLAG (Fig. 4, A and D) and phalloidin (Fig. 4, B and E) signals. When the two signals are merged, partial co-localization can be observed, indicating that both F-actin and α-rENaC segregate to the same region of the apical domain. Western Blotting of α-ENaC—In order to examine whether α-rENaC and actin are found in the same protein complex, we attempted to co-immunoprecipitate FLAG-tagged α-ENaC and actin from the MDCK cell line. To first demonstrate that we were able to immunoprecipitate specifically FLAG-tagged α-ENaC, we used the monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody; the α-subunit was immunoprecipitated using the anti-FLAG antibody, and the resulting immunoblot was then probed with the same primary antibody (Fig. 5A). As shown in lane 3, FLAG tagged α-ENaC was only detected by the anti-FLAG antibody in lysates immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody. It was not detected in the beads only control (lane 1) or the nonimmune mouse IgG control (lane 2) or when blots were probed with the secondary antibody alone (lanes 4-6). To further demonstrate that the 100-kDa polypeptide immunoprecipitated by the anti-FLAG antibody was indeed α-rENaC, samples were immunoprecipitated with the anti-FLAG antibody and the blot was probed using a commercially available anti-α-rENaC antibody (Fig. 5B). In addition to the stably transfected MDCK ENaC cell lysate (designated E), lysates prepared from the original MDCK parental strain (designated P) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-FLAG antibody. The parental strain has pre"

It is now clear that the long-duration type are caused by explosions of massive stars in distant star-forming galaxies. Only in recent months, with the Swift satellite latching onto bursts as soon as they happen, has it been possible to collect data on short bursts that may lead to similar certainty as to their cause. GRB 050724 burst onto the scene on 24 July, and has all the properties needed to solve the mystery of short GRBs. The new evidence supports the merging compact object model of short GRBs, involving either a neutron star–neutron star merger, or a neutron star–black hole binary system as progenitor. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) divide into two classes1: ‘long’, which typically have initial durations of T90 > 2 s, and ‘short’, with durations of T90 < 2 s (where T90 is the time to detect 90% of the observed fluence). Long bursts, which on average have softer γ-ray spectra2, are known to be associated with stellar core-collapse events—in some cases simultaneously producing powerful type Ic supernovae3,4,5. In contrast, the origin of short bursts has remained mysterious until recently. A subsecond intense ‘spike’ of γ-rays during a giant flare from the Galactic soft γ-ray repeater, SGR 1806–20, reopened an old debate over whether some short GRBs could be similar events seen in galaxies out to ∼70 Mpc (refs 6–10; redshift z ≈ 0.016). Shortly after that, localizations of a few short GRBs (with optical afterglows detected in two cases11,12) have shown an apparent association with a variety of host galaxies at moderate redshifts11,12,13,14. Here we report a correlation between the locations of previously observed short bursts and the positions of galaxies in the local Universe, indicating that between 10 and 25 per cent of short GRBs originate at low redshifts (z < 0.025)."
https://openalex.org/W2078587980,"CtBP family members, CtBP1 and CtBP2, are unique transcriptional regulators that adapt a metabolic enzyme fold, and their activities are regulated by NAD(H)-binding. CtBP1 is both cytoplasmic and nuclear, and its subcellular localization is regulated by sumoylation, phosphorylation, and binding to a PDZ protein. In contrast, we showed that CtBP2 is exclusively nuclear. CtBP1 and CtBP2 are highly similar, but differ at the N-terminal 20 amino acid region. Substitution of the N-terminal domain of CtBP1 with the corresponding CtBP2 domain confers a dominant nuclear localization pattern to CtBP1. The N-terminal domain of CtBP2 contains three Lys residues. Our results show that these Lys residues are acetylated by the nuclear acetylase p300. Although all three Lys residues of CtBP2 (Lys-6, Lys-8, and Lys-10) appear to be acetylated, acetylation of Lys-10 is critical for nuclear localization. CtBP2 with a single amino acid substitution at Lys-10 (K10R) is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic localization of the K10R mutant is correlated with enhanced nuclear export that is inhibited by leptomycin B. Furthermore, lack of acetylation at Lys-10 renders CtBP2 to be more efficient in repression of the E-cadherin promoter. Our studies have revealed the important roles of acetylation in regulating subcellular localization and transcriptional activity of CtBP2.

The CtBP (E1A C-terminal binding protein) family proteins are highly conserved in higher eukaryotes and are linked to important biological processes (1.Chinnadurai G. Mol.

Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), function as transcriptional corepressors. Consistent with the high sequence similarity between vertebrate CtBP1 and CtBP2, they exhibit overlapping transcriptional regulatory activities during mouse development (7.Hildebrand J.D. Soriano P. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 5296-5307Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The CtBP corepressors are recruited by various repressors through a conserved CtBP-binding motif (PXDLS) that was first identified in adenovirus E1A proteins (4.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar).Unlike other transcription factors, CtBPs share a high degree of sequence homology with a group of metabolic enzymes of the 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase family (4.Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of CtBP1 has revealed that it is indeed a 2-hydroxy acid dehydrogenase (16.Kumar V. Carlson J.E. Ohgi K.A. Edwards T.A. Rose D.W. Escalante C.R. Rosenfeld M.G. Aggarwal A.K.

At present, the relationship between the intrinsic dehydrogenase activity of CtBP and the transcriptional repression activity is not clear and remains controversial (6.Turner J. Crossley M.

However, binding of CtBP1 with NAD(H) promotes its oligomerization and enhances the affinity for PXDLS-containing transcription factors (18.Balasubramanian P. Zhao L.J. Chinnadurai G. FEBS Lett. 2003; 537: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20.Zhang Q. Piston D.W. Goodman R.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1895-1897PubMed Google Scholar) and has been postulated to link the cellular metabolic status to transcriptional regulation (21.Fjeld C.C. Birdsong W.T. Goodman R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9202-9207Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The dinucleotide binding activity of dCtBP has been shown to be critically important for the transcriptional repression activity in a native chromatin environment (22.Sutrias-Grau M. Arnosti D.N. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 5953-5966Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Although the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of CtBPs remain to be fully elucidated, an analysis of a nuclear CtBP1 protein complex has revealed that CtBP may effect its transcriptional repression activity at least in part by recruitment of other enzymatic components, such as histone deacetylases and a histone methyl transferase (23.Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y. Nature. 2003; 422: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and a novel lysine-specific demethylase (24.Shi Y. Lan F. Matson C. Mulligan P. Whetstine J.R. Cole P.A. Casero R.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 941-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3093) Google Scholar). CtBP1 has also been reported to inhibit the general transcriptional machinery through direct interaction with nuclear acetylases such as p300 via a PXDLS motif located within the bromodomain of these enzymes (25.Kim J.H. Cho E.J. Kim S.T. Youn H.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 423-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In addition to the nuclear transcriptional regulatory activities, CtBPs also have certain diverse cytoplasmic activities (26.Chinnadurai G. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For example, CtBP1-S, which is identical to CtBP1 except for the absence of the N-terminal 12 amino acid region, has been implicated in Golgi membrane fission in in vitro studies (8.Spano S. Silletta M.G. Colanzi A. Alberti S. Fiucci G. Valente C. Fusella A. Salmona M. Mironov A. Luini A. Corda D. Spanfo S. J. Biol.

Science. 2004; 305: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It appears that the membrane fission activity of CtBP1-S might be related to a slow acyltransferase activity associated with CtBP1/CtBP1-S (17.Nardini M. Spano S. Cericola C. Pesce A. Massaro A. Millo E. Luini A. Corda D. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3122-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28.Weigert R. Silletta M.G. Spano S. Turacchio G. Cericola C. Colanzi A. Senatore S.

However, the existence of an intrinsic acyltransferase activity of CtBP1-S remains controversial (30.Gallop J.L. Butler P.J. McMahon H.T. Nature. 2005; 438: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In the retina, the photoreceptor ribbon synaptic complex contains RIBEYE (9.Schmitz F. Konigstorfer A. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2000; 28: 857-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar) and CtBP1 (31.tom Dieck S. Altrock W.D. Kessels M.M. Qualmann B. Regus H. Brauner D. Fejtova A. Bracko O. Gundelfinger E.D. Brandstatter J.H. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 825-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). RIBEYE and CtBP1 are important for the assembly and function of central nervous system synapses. Thus, CtBP family proteins in addition to their dominant transcriptional regulatory activity also perform diverse activities in the cytoplasmic compartment.The regulation of subcellular localization of CtBP1 has recently been examined in some detail. CtBP1 have been reported to be a target for the p21-activated protein kinase (Pak) 1 (32.Barnes C.J. Vadlamudi R.K. Mishra S.K. Jacobson R.H. Li F. Kumar R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pak1 specifically phosphorylates CtBP1 at Ser-158 resulting in CtBP1 redistribution from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby blocking the corepressor function of CtBP1 under specific growth conditions. Although sequences of CtBP2 are conserved at the Pak1 phosphorylation site, it is not known whether CtBP2 is a target for Pak1. The polycomb protein Pc2 forms a specific complex with CtBP1 (13.Sewalt R.G. Gunster M.J. van der Vlag J. Satijn D.P. Otte A.P. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 777-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 23.Shi Y. Sawada J. Sui G. Affar el B. Whetstine J.R. Lan F. Ogawa H. Luke M.P. Nakatani Y.

Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) resulting in sumoylation of CtBP1 at a single Lys (Lys-428) residue (34.Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 35.Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The SUMO modification of CtBP1 appears to be critical for its nuclear accumulation. CtBP1 is also subject to an additional regulatory process that governs its nucleocytoplasmic distribution. The C-terminal region of CtBP1 has a PDZ-binding motif (1.Chinnadurai G. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 213-224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar), which mediates interaction with a PDZ domain containing protein, neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, changing the localization pattern of CtBP1 from nuclear to cytoplasmic (36.Riefler G.M. Firestein B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48262-48268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, sumoylation and PDZ binding exert opposing effects on subcellular localization of CtBP1 (35.Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In contrast to CtBP1, CtBP2 is not sumoylated (34.Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 35.Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol.

In this report, we show that CtBP2 has a dominant nuclear localization pattern, which is dictated by the N-terminal 20 amino acid domain. Further, we demonstrate that CtBP2 is acetylated by p300 at Lys-6, Lys-8, and Lys-10 and that acetylation of Lys-10 is critically important for nuclear retention of CtBP2.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression Constructs—The mammalian expression vector pIRESneo3 (Clontech) was modified to express Flag-HA 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; wt, wild type; 3KR, three mutated Lys residues. tag at the N terminus of a protein of interest. A double-stranded oligonucleotide encoding the Flag-HA epitopes was ligated to the StuI/EcoRI sites of pIRESnes3 to generate pFH-IRESneo vector. All CtBP1 and CtBP2 expression constructs were based on pFH-IRESneo, using PCR-amplified coding sequences. All PCR-amplified regions in the clones were sequence-confirmed by automatic DNA sequence analysis.Cell Culture and Transfection—HeLa and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Transfections were performed with the Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Typically, 2.5 × 105 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well plate 1 day prior to transfection, and DNA precipitates were prepared using 3 μg of a plasmid DNA and 7 μlofthe Lipofectamine 2000 reagent unless indicated otherwise. For siRNA experiments, HeLa cells were first transfected with SmartPool siRNAs (Dharmacon) with Dharmafect 1 (Dharmacon) and 24 h later were transfected with the CtBP2 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Protein analyses were carried out 24 h after the second transfection. For E-cadherin promoter assays, the reporter plasmid pE-Cad-Luc and promoterless phRL-0 were cotransfected with different CtBP-expression plasmids into CtBP1–/–/CtBP2–/– mouse embryonic fibroblasts (immortalized with retrovirally introduced SV40 T-antigen), using the jetPEI transfection reagent (ISC BioExpress). Dual luciferase assays were performed with the Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) 2 days after transfection.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analyses—Cells were lysed for 30 min at 4 °C in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na Butyrate, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation and bound to 30 μl of FLAG (Sigma) antibody beads at 4 °C for 1.5 h in IP buffer. After washing three times, immunoprecipitated proteins were examined by Western blot using the ECL-plus (Amersham Biosciences) detection method.Immunofluorescence Analysis—For staining ectopically expressed proteins, transfected (transiently or stably) cells in 6-well plates were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and then permeablized with methanol for 6 min at –20 °C. After a brief rinse with phosphate-buffered saline, cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) in a humidified chamber for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and photographed under a Nikon fluorescent microscope with a digital camera. The endogenous CtBP proteins were stained with CtBP1 or CtBP2 mAbs (Pharmingen), with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody conjugated to rhodamine (Pierce).RESULTSCtBP2, But Not CtBP1, Is Localized Exclusively in the Nucleus—Because CtBP2 is not sumoylated and lacks the PDZ-binding motif, we hypothesized that subcellular localization of CtBP2 might be regulated differently from CtBP1. To investigate this aspect, we first examined the subcellular localization of CtBP2 in comparison with CtBP1 by indirect immunofluorescence analysis. The specificities of the antibodies used in these studies were confirmed by their differential reactivity toward CtBP1 or CtBP2 by Western blot analysis of N-terminally tagged versions (Flag-HA) of CtBP1 or CtBP2 immunoprecipitated from stably transfected cell lines (Fig. 1A). The CtBP1 antibody recognized only CtBP1, and the CtBP2 antibody recognized only CtBP2. A minor band revealed in the opposing lane might be because of heterodimerization of endogenous CtBP proteins with the exogenously expressed CtBP proteins. For the immunofluorescence analysis of endogenous CtBP2, two human cell lines, HeLa and A549, were stained with antibodies specific to CtBP1 or CtBP2. These studies revealed striking exclusive nuclear localization of CtBP2 in both HeLa and A549 cells (Fig. 1B), whereas CtBP1 displayed predominant nuclear staining with partial cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 1C). To substantiate the localization patterns further, we examined exogenously introduced CtBP1 and CtBP2 (tagged with FLAG and HA epitopes) in stable HeLa cell lines (Fig. 1D). Immunofluorescence analysis with the FLAG antibody revealed that the patterns of subcellular localization of the ectopically expressed CtBP1 and CtBP2 are similar to that of the endogenous CtBP1 and CtBP2 (compare Fig. 1, B and C with D). We also examined the localization patterns of transiently expressed CtBPs (Fig. 1E), which were found to be highly similar to patterns of endogenous CtBPs and the patterns of CtBPs expressed in stably transfected cell lines (Fig. 1D). Thus, our analyses using three different approaches have shown exclusive nuclear localization of CtBP2 and nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of CtBP1. A similar localization pattern of CtBP1 has been reported by several previous studies (34.Kagey M.H. Melhuish T.A. Wotton D. Cell. 2003; 113: 127-137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 35.Lin X. Sun B. Liang M. Liang Y.Y. Gast A. Hildebrand J. Brunicardi F.C. Melchior F. Feng X.H. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 1389-1396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).Nuclear Targeting Function of the N-terminal Region of CtBP2—The four members of the CtBP family, CtBP1, CtBP2, CtBP1-S, and RIBEYE share a high degree of sequence identity except at the N-terminal region (Fig. 2A). The N-terminal 20-amino-acid region of CtBP2 contains several basic amino acid residues that may potentially constitute a nuclear localization signal. To examine the potential nuclear localization signal function of this sequence, the N-terminal 21 residues of CtBP2 were replaced with Met-Ser-Gly-Val residues (Fig. 2B). The resulting CtBP2 mutant (ΔN-CtBP2), bears the N-terminal residues of CtBP1-S/BARS (Fig. 2A). An immunofluorescence analysis of the mutant, ΔN-CtBP2 revealed its distribution throughout the cells, in sharp contrast to the wt CtBP2 (Fig. 2C). A similar deletion of the N-terminal residues of CtBP1 generated a CtBP1 mutant, ΔN-CtBP1, which is identical to CtBP1-S/BARS (Fig. 2B). This deletion did not affect the partial nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of CtBP1 (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the N-terminal region of CtBP2 contains a key determinant for the nuclear localization of CtBP2.FIGURE 2Nuclear localization function of the N-terminal region of CtBP2. A, N-terminal sequences of the CtBP family proteins. Numbers denote the position of amino acid residues. The A domain of RIBEYE is unrelated to CtBP and is fused to CtBP2 as a result of differential RNA splicing of a transcript generated from a tissue-specific promoter. B, substitution mutants of CtBP1 and CtBP2. Numbers denote the positions of amino acid residues. In N2-CtBP1, the N-terminal 21 residues of CtBP2 were fused to residue 16 of CtBP1.

HeLa cells were transfected with various mutant plasmids and examined for CtBP proteins by immunofluorescent staining with the FLAG antibody conjugated to Cy3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine whether the CtBP2 N-terminal region is the major determinant for the differential subcellular localization of CtBP1 and CtBP2, the N-terminal 21 residues of CtBP2 were substituted for the N-terminal 15 residues of CtBP1 (Fig. 2B). The resulting chimeric protein, N2-CtBP1, was detected exclusively in the nucleus (Fig. 2C), in a fashion identical to that of wt CtBP2. Thus, the distinct nuclear localization pattern of CtBP2 appears to be determined by its unique N-terminal sequence. Further, it could also confer a predominant nuclear localization pattern to CtBP1.Lys-10 Is Critical for the Nuclear Retention of CtBP2—There are three Lys residues in the N-terminal region of CtBP2 (Fig. 3A). Because Lys residues are frequent targets for post-translational modifications, we decided to examine the effect of these residues in nuclear localization of CtBP2. To examine their roles, they were mutated together or singly to Arg residues (Fig. 3A) so that the overall charge of the mutant CtBP2 would be comparable with that of wt CtBP2. The mutant plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells, and the cells were stained with the FLAG antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B, although K6R and K8R mutations had no effects on the exclusive nuclear localization of CtBP2, mutation of all three Lys residues (3KR) as well as mutation of Lys-10 (K10R) caused CtBP2 to be localized predominantly in the cytoplasm. Thus, Lys-10 plays a critical role in exclusive nuclear localization of CtBP2.FIGURE 3Role of N-terminal Lys residues in nuclear localization of CtBP2. A, N-terminal sequence of CtBP2 and Lys mutations. The basic residues within the N-terminal region are indicated in italics. B, subcellular localization of N-terminal mutants of CtBP2. HeLa cells were transfected and CtBP2 proteins were detected by immunofluorescent staining with the FLAG antibody conjugated to Cy3. C, effect of leptomycin B (LMB) on subcellular localization of 3KR and K10R mutants. The transfected cells were either mock-treated or treated with leptomycin B (7.5 ng/ml for 4 h), and the immunofluorescence analysis was performed as in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The predominant cytoplasmic localization of 3KR-CtBP2 and K10R-CtBP2 (with nuclear exclusion) is in sharp contrast to the partial nuclear localization of ΔN-CtBP2, which totally lacks the N-terminal region (Fig. 2). It appears that the mutations 3KR and K10R confer a dominant cytoplasmic localization pattern to CtBP2. This function may be because of cytoplasmic retention of 3KR-CtBP2 and K10R-CtBP2 by cytosolic factors or because of enhanced nuclear export of these mutant proteins. To examine whether nuclear export accounts for the predominant cytoplasmic localization of K10R-CtBP2, transfected cells were treated with the nuclear export inhibitor, leptomycin B, which specifically inhibits nuclear export mediated by CRM-1 (37.Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3C, the leptomycin B treatment resulted in partial nuclear localization of mutants 3KR or K10R in majority of cells. A similar treatment of cells transfected with CtBP1 has no detectable effect on CtBP1 localization (not shown). These results suggest that K10R-CtBP2 is capable of nuclear localization but is efficiently exported from the nucleus.N-terminal Lys Residues of CtBP2 Are Acetylated—Our results (Fig. 3) suggest that the Lys-10 is important for nuclear retention of CtBP2 and a mutation of this residue (K10R) does not significantly impede with nuclear import. Because the mutation (K10R) does not cause a significant charge change in CtBP2, we decided to investigate the potential acetylation of the Lys residues. For this purpose, a panel of CtBP proteins was immunoprecipitated from transfected cells and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal pan Ac-Lys antibody. As shown in Fig. 4A, both the wt CtBP2 (lane 4) and a mutant (A58E) defective in PXDLS-binding (17.Nardini M. Spano S. Cericola C. Pesce A. Massaro A. Millo E. Luini A. Corda D. Bolognesi M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3122-3130Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) (lane 6), were acetylated well. Deletion of the N-terminal 20 residues (ΔN) of CtBP2 (lane 5), or mutation of all three N-terminal Lys residues together (mutant 3KR, lane 7), abolished acetylation of CtBP2 almost completely. The acetylation of various single Lys → Arg mutants (K6R, K8R, and K10R) was also severely reduced (lanes 8–10). Among the three mutants, K6R and K10R exhibited a higher level of reduction in acetylation than the mutant K8R. In contrast to CtBP2, acetylation of CtBP1 was not detectable (compare lane 2 with lane 4). However, fusion of the N-terminal region of CtBP2 to CtBP1 rendered CtBP1 to be acetylated (N2-CtBP1, lane 3), albeit at a lower level than CtBP2 (lane 4). In all CtBP-containing lanes except for ΔN-CtBP2 (lane 5), a band of ∼50 kDa was also present, which does not correspond to Flag-HA-tagged CtBP proteins. Its identity is not known.FIGURE 4Acetylation of CtBP2. A, effect of CtBP mutations.

https://openalex.org/W2164246556,"Cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a microbicide candidate that inactivates a wide range of HIV strains by binding to gp120. Production of CV-N, or any protein microbicide, needs to be at extremely high levels and low cost to have an impact on global health. Thus, it is unlikely that fermentor-based systems will be suitable, including recombinant E. coli, where CV-N aggregates and dimers have consistently been found. Transgenic plants may provide a suitable expression system for protein microbicides, as production can be easily and economically scaled up. Here, Nicotiana tabacum was transformed with a gene encoding CV-N to explore proof of concept for the production of CV-N in transgenic plants. Plant-derived rCV-N was recoverable at levels of 130 ng/mg of fresh leaf tissue, or at least 0.85% of total soluble plant protein. Western blot analysis demonstrated that virtually all of the rCV-N was expressed in the desired monomeric form. Functionality was demonstrated by specific binding to gp120 and protection of T-cells from in vitro HIV infection. Hydroponic culturing of transgenic plants demonstrated CV-N rhizosecretion at levels of 0.64 mug/ml hydroponic media after 24 days. Therefore, we suggest that transgenic plants have the potential to provide strategies for large-scale protein microbicide production."

This squid is abundant in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, but its life history remains a mystery because spawning takes place at such great depths. ‘Gonatids’, like other squid, were thought to deposit their eggs on the sea floor and leave them to develop on their own but now they have been seen cradling eggs in their arms. These brooding squid may be an unwitting link between the deep and shallow marine ecosystems: their immobility makes them sitting ducks for whales and elephant seals diving in search of food. Gonatus onyx is one of the most abundant cephalopods in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans1 and is an important prey species for a variety of vertebrate predators2,3, but a full understanding of its life history has been hampered because spawning occurs at great depths4,5, where observation is difficult. Here we describe post-spawning egg care, or brooding, in this deep-sea squid. Our finding is unexpected because this behaviour differs from the reproductive habits of all other known squid species."

Mycolic acids, α-branched β-hydroxylated long chain fatty acids, are the hallmark of the Mycobacterium genus that comprises the causative agents of human diseases such as tuberculosis and leprosy, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae, respectively. These major cell envelope components play an important role in the structure and function of the mycobacterial cell envelope (1.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Goren M.B. Brennan P.J. Youmans G.P. Tuberculosis. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia, PA1979: 63-193Google Scholar). For instance, mycolic acids attached to the cell wall arabinogalactanareorganizedwithotherlipidstoformanouterpermeabilitybarrier with an extremely low fluidity that confers an exceptional low permeability to mycobacteria and may explain their intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics (3.Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). Similarly, trehalose mycolates have been implicated in numerous biological functions related both to the physiology and virulence of M. tuberculosis (1.Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous studies have been and are currently devoted to understanding the structures and biosynthesis of mycolic acids, primarily because they are specific to the Mycobacterium genus, and their metabolism is the only clearly identified target inhibited by the major anti-tubercular drug isoniazid (4.Winder F.G. Collins P.B. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1970; 63: 41-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 5.Takayama K. Wang L. David H.L. Antimicrob.

With the resurgence of tuberculosis infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains and the need for the development of new anti-tubercular drugs, deciphering the biosynthesis pathway leading to mycolates still represents a major objective. Although much work remains to be done to complete their biosynthetic scheme, it is known that two mycobacterial fatty acid synthases participate in the formation of all types of mycolates. Fatty acid synthase I is necessary to produce C16,18 and C22-26 saturated fatty acids, which may be either directly incorporated into mycolates as the α-branch chain or used as substrates of the acyl carrier protein-dependent elongation system, fatty acid synthase-II, to produce the long meromycolic chain (for a recent review, see Ref. 9.Takayama K. Wang C. Besra G.S. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Mycolic acids usually occur in mycobacterial species as a mixture of various related molecules with different chemical groups at the so-called “proximal” and “distal” positions of their meromycolic chain (Fig. 1A). In members of the M. tuberculosis complex (M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium africanum, Mycobacterium bovis, Mycobacterium microti, and Mycobacterium canetti), three types of mycolates are commonly encountered (10.Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. (Paris). 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar, 11.Minnikin D.E. Minnikin S.M. Parlett J.H. Goodfellow M. Magnusson M. Arch. Microbiol. 1984; 139: 225-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The least polar type I α-mycolates are composed of C76-82 fatty acids (12.Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Deon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain two cis cyclopropyl groups. The more polar type III and IV mycolates consist of C82-89 (12.Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Deon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and contain a cis or trans (with a methyl group on the vicinal carbon atom) cyclopropyl group at the proximal position and a keto or methoxy group (with a methyl group on the vicinal carbon atom) at the distal position (Fig. 1A). These discrete structural variations in mycolates may be of crucial biological importance since it has been shown that mutations resulting in the loss of these chemical functions, and particularly the keto and methoxy groups, profoundly modify the permeability of the cell envelope to solutes and severely affect the virulence and pathogenicity of the mutant strains in experimental infections (13.Yuan Y.

Indeed, inactivation of the gene resulted in the suppression of the synthesis of both types of mycolic acid (12.Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Deon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal.

Consistently, transformation of Mycobacterium smegmatis with the hma gene resulted in the production of large amounts of hydroxymycolic acids with an adjacent methyl branch, structurally related to the ketomycolic acids of M. tuberculosis (20.Dubnau E.

Trace amounts of these hydroxymycolic acids were also detected in mycobacterial species producing keto- and/or methoxymycolates, further supporting the hypothesis that hydroxymycolic acids can be the precursors of both keto- and methoxymycolic acids (21.Quémard A.

Thus, the Hma protein would transfer a methyl group from the SAM cofactor and, subsequently or simultaneously, a water molecule onto the double bound of ethylene substrates, leading to the formation of an hydroxylated product (15.Dubnau E.

Other evidence also suggests that SAM-dependent methyltransferases would operate on full-length meromycolic derivatives (13.Yuan Y. Zhu Y. Crane D.D. Barry III, C.E. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 1449-1458Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 22.Qureshi N. Sathyamoorthy N. Takayama K. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 157: 46-52Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the mechanism of catalysis of this reaction and as a prerequisite for drug design, we have studied the Hma protein and solved its three-dimensional structure in the apo-form and in complex with SAM to 2.1 and 2.0 Å of resolution, respectively. Analysis of the Mycolic Acid Profile of Recombinant M. smegmatis Strains—The hma (mmaA4, Rv0642c) gene from M. tuberculosis H37Rv was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and first cloned into the BamHI restriction site of the pQE30 plasmid (Qiagen), downstream the poly-His-coding region. This construction removed the first methionine residue from the sequence deduced from the gene and added 12 residues, including a non-cleavable His6-tag at the N terminus, leading to a protein that contains 312 amino acid residues. Using this construct as a template, the hma gene alone or together with the poly-His tag (h-hma) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of the mycobacterial expression vector pMV261. The strain M. smegmatis mc2155 was transformed by electroporation (23.Stover C.K. de la Cruz V.F. Fuerst T.R. Burlein J.E. Benson L.A. Bennett L.T. Bansal G.P. Young J.F. Lee M.H. Hatfull G.F.

The recombinant strains were selected on 7H10 medium (Middlebrook) supplemented with 0.2% glycerol and 10 μg/ml kanamycin. Isolated colonies were used to inoculate cultures grown on the same medium. Bacteria were submitted to saponification as previously described (12.Laval F. Lanéelle M.A. Deon C. Monsarrat B. Daffé M. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4537-4544Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). After methylation using diazomethane, the mycolate patterns were analyzed by TLC on silica gel 60-coated plates (0.25 mm thickness, Macherey-Nagel) with elution in dichloromethane. Purified mycolic acid methyl esters were used as standards (10.Daffé M. Lanéelle M.A. Asselineau C. Levy-Frebault V. David H. Ann. Microbiol. (Paris). 1983; 134: 241-256Google Scholar). Fatty acid methyl esters were revealed by spraying molybdophosphoric acid (10% in ethanol) and charring. Expression and Purification of Hma for Structural Studies—The construction used for protein expression and purification was obtained by cloning the hma gene into the NdeI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). This construction removed the first three residues (Met-Thr-Arg) from the sequence deduced from the gene and added 20 residues, including a 17-residue-long cleavable His6-tag at the N terminus, leading to a fusion protein that contains 318 amino acid residues. The overexpression of the recombinant Hma fusion protein was carried out in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. Cultures were grown at 37 °C in Luria broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. One millimolar isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added for induction when cell density reached an A600 of ∼0.5-0.9, and cell cultures were incubated for another 3 h at 37°C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellets were washed with 50 mm MES-NaOH, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 6.5, and placed overnight at -20 °C. Bacteria were then lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 5000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Recombinant Hma was purified by using fast protein liquid chromatography on an ÄKTA Purifier system (Amersham Biosciences). First, the supernatant was applied to a chelating-Sepharose nickel affinity column (Amersham Biosciences). After extensive washes with 5 mm imidazole in 50 mm MES-NaOH, 0.3 m NaCl, pH 6.5, the protein was eluted with 0.15 m imidazole in the same buffer. Fractions corresponding to the protein were pooled and concentrated, and the engineered His6 tag was removed by thrombin (Novagen) (2 units/mg of protein, 4 h at 20 °C) if necessary. Concentrated tagged and untagged proteins were further purified by gel filtration with a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 prepgrade chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences) and both eluted with 50 mm MES-NaOH, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.5. Fractions containing pure recombinant proteins were pooled, concentrated to 3-10 mg/ml using Centricon YM-10 (Millipore) devices, and stored at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined by measuring UV spectra (A280 = 0.93 at 1 mg/ml, 1 cm). Electrophoretic Analysis and Mass Spectrometry—Protein purity was checked throughout purification using SDS-PAGE with a 15% acrylamide concentration. For mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE separations were conducted using 12% polyacrylamide gels stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Passive elution of proteins from polyacrylamide gels was achieved as described in Kurth and Stoffel (24.Kurth J. Stoffel W. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Claverol et al. (25.Claverol S. Burlet-Schiltz O. Gairin J.E. Monsarrat B. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2003; 2: 483-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel pieces were excised and subsequently washed with H2O, and the proteins were allowed to diffuse out of the gel overnight at 37 °C by incubation in 20 μl of 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.2. Coomassie Brilliant Blue, SDS and salts were removed from the protein sample after passive elution by hydrophilic interaction chromatography using a ZipTipHPL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore). Briefly, the ZipTipHPL was rehydrated in buffer A (H2O/CH3CN/CH3COOH 50/50/0.1, pH 5) and equilibrated with buffer B (H2O/CH3CN/CH3COOH 10/90/0.1, pH 5.5). Protein eluates were diluted in 200 μl of buffer B and loaded onto the ZipTipHPL. Salts were removed by washing with buffer B, and proteins were eluted with 4 μlof H2O/CH3CN/HCOOH (49/50/1). Electrospray ionization analysis was performed using an electrospray ionization quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometer (QSTAR Pulsar, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) operating in positive mode. A potential of 1-2 kV was applied to the precoated nanoelectrospray needles (New Objective, Picotips, Econotips) in the ion source. Instrument operation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using Analyst® QS 1.0 software and Bioanalyst TM extensions. After extraction of the protein from the gel spot and desalting, acetonitrile was evaporated from the eluate at room temperature. Five microliters of trypsin solution (Promega) at 12.5 ng/μl in 12.5 mm NH4HCO3 were added, and the sample was incubated overnight at 37 °C. MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analyses were performed on a MALDI-TOF/TOF instrument (4700 Proteomics Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). A 0.5-μl volume of trypsin digest was applied on the MALDI target plate with 0.3 μl of matrix solution (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic; 5 mg/ml in H2O/acetonitrile/TFA, 50/50/0.1). Mass spectra were acquired in automated positive reflector mode, from m/z 700 to 3500 and calibrated with external calibration. Peak lists from peptide mass mapping spectra were compared manually with the theoretical molecular masses of the trypsin peptides of Hma. Crystallization and X-ray Data Collection—Crystallization was performed at 12 °C by vapor equilibration using the hanging-drop method. Protein samples were concentrated to 3-10 mg/ml in the appropriate buffer (50 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, pH 6.5). Drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of protein and reservoir solutions; reservoir volumes of 500 μl were used. Basic, extension, and low ionic screens from Sigma were systematically used for initial screenings. X-ray diffraction quality crystals of Hma were obtained for the His6-tagged protein in the presence of 4-28% polyethylene glycol 3350, pH 5-9. All crystals were cryocooled in a stream of nitrogen gas at 100 K after a 3-min immersion in the crystallization solution supplemented with 20% (v/v) glycerol and stored in liquid nitrogen if necessary. For preparation of the binary complex with the cofactor, crystals were soaked in a solution containing both the cryoprotectant and 50 mm S-adenosylmethionine for 2-3 min. The various crystal forms were evaluated in-house at 285 and 100 K using a Rigaku RU300 rotating-anode source operating at 50 kV and 90 mA and a MarResearch Mar345dtb image-plate area detector. Diffraction data used for structure determination and refinement were collected at multistation beam-line ID14 of the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). Data Processing and Phasing—All crystallographic calculations were performed using the CCP4 suite (26.Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19770) Google Scholar) as implemented in the graphical user interface (27.Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr.

Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend: Data Collection and Processing. Science and Engineering Research Council, Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1993: 114-122Google Scholar). The structure of Hma in its apo-form was solved using molecular replacement with the program Phaser (30.Storoni L.C. McCoy A.J. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1099) Google Scholar) and the structure of apoCmaA1 (31.Huang C.C. Smith C.V. Glickman M.S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11559-11569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (PDB entry code 1KP9). The search model was truncated as a polyalanine except for strictly conserved residues among the family of mycolic acid SAM-MTs from M. tuberculosis. The structure of Hma in complex with its cofactor was solved using the refined model of apoHma and molecular replacement with the program Phaser to compensate for variation along the unit cell c axis. Model Building and Crystallographic Refinement—Model building of apoHma was first carried out with ARP/wARP using the “warpNtrace” automated procedure (32.Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The initial map used for the calculation corresponded to the molecular replacement solution where several regions of the protein with different conformation were removed. All structures were then constructed manually in sigmaA-weighted electron density maps (33.Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2036) Google Scholar) using TURBO-FRODO. Restrained refinements of the structures were performed with the program REFMAC (34.Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) using a bulk solvent correction based on the Babinet principle and minimizing a maximum likelihood target function. Solvent molecules were automatically added as neutral oxygen atoms using wARP (35.Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). In the last stages of refinement, TLS parameters were refined using a single group for the whole molecule, which resulted in a similar improvement of the R and Rfree values. Production of the Figures—Fig. 3A was produced using TopDraw from the CCP4 graphical user interface (27.Potterton E. Briggs P. Turkenburg M. Dodson E. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2156880303,"An imbalance between production and scavenging of oxidants is a commonality found in factors that result in fetal determinants that negatively affect adult health. We reasoned that a dietary intervention that promotes oxidant scavenging through phase 2 protein induction would have positive effects on fetal programming of adult health. Previously, we demonstrated that a diet containing broccoli sprouts high in glucoraphanin (Grn), precursor of the phase 2 protein inducer sulforaphane, decreased oxidative stress and associated problems in male spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRsp). We hypothesized that placing females on a Grn-containing (Grn+) diet would have similar positive effects and that the adult offspring of such females would have lower blood pressures and less tissue inflammation than offspring from mothers on control diet. We demonstrate that female SHRsp on a Grn+ diet had decreased oxidative stress and associated problems such as hypertension than females on control diet. The offspring of females on Grn+ diet also had lower blood pressures and less tissue inflammation in adulthood regardless of diet, with offspring placed on a Grn+ diet having the best health outcomes. We conclude that reducing oxidative stress in pregnant females has profound outcomes in the health of their adult offspring."
https://openalex.org/W2161533610,"Members of the BTB-kelch superfamily play important roles during fundamental cellular processes, such as the regulation of cell morphology, migration, and gene expression. The BTB-kelch protein LZTR-1 is deleted in the majority of DiGeorge syndrome patients and is believed to act as a transcriptional regulator. However, functional and expression profiling studies of LZTR-1 have not been performed thus far. Therefore, we examined the subcellular localization and function of LZTR-1 to gain insights into its biological role. Analysis of the primary structure of the protein revealed six N-terminal kelch motifs and two BTB/POZ domains at the C terminus within LZTR-1. Confocal analysis of the subcellular distribution of LZTR-1 using the Golgi markers GM130, Golgin-97, and TGN46 identified a localization of LZTR-1 exclusively on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi network that is mediated by its second BTB/POZ domain. In contrast to most other BTB-kelch proteins, LZTR-1 did not co-localize with actin. Treatment with brefeldin A did not lead to redistribution of LZTR-1 to the endoplasmic reticulum but caused its relocalization in dispersed, punctuated structures that were also positive for GM130. These data demonstrate that LZTR-1 is a Golgi matrix-associated protein. Upon induction of apoptosis, LZTR-1 was phosphorylated on tyrosine residues and subsequently degraded; that could be rescued partially by the addition of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk and the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132. Taken together, our experiments identify LZTR-1 as the first BTB-kelch protein that exclusively localizes to the Golgi network, and the binding of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex is mediated by its second BTB/POZ domain.

Taken together, our experiments identify LZTR-1 as the first BTB-kelch protein that exclusively localizes to the Golgi network, and the binding of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex is mediated by its second BTB/POZ domain. The kelch motif was identified as a segment of 44–56 amino acids in the ORF1 protein in Drosophila (1Xue F. Cooley L. Cell. 1993; 72: 681-693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). kelch proteins typically contain 4–7 kelch motifs that form a propeller-like structure. In addition to the kelch motifs, the majority of the kelch proteins contain a BTB/POZ domain (broad complex, tramtrack and brick a brac/Pox virus and zinc finger) that mediates protein-protein interactions (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Recently, the BACK domain (BTB and C-terminal kelch) has been described in several BTB-kelch proteins; however, its function is unknown (3Stogios P.J. Prive G.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 634-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Bioinformatic analysis identified at least 71 kelch proteins in the human genome, which reveals that the kelch motif is widely distributed (4Prag S. Adams J.C. BMC Bioinformatics 2003. 2003; (4/42)Google Scholar). Many kelch domain-containing proteins interact with actin and are important mediators of fundamental cellular functions, such as regulation of cellular architecture, cellular organization, and cell migration (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, the kelch motif-containing protein Keap1 can interact with the transcription factor Nrf2, which regulates the expression of downstream genes encoding detoxifying and antioxidant proteins (5Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar, 6Zipper L.M. Mulcahy R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36544-36552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Recently, it has also been shown that some BTB-kelch proteins serve as a substrate-specific adapter for cullin 3 ubiquitin ligases (7Cullinan S.B. Gordan J.D. Jin J. Harper J.W. Diehl J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8477-8486Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 8Kobayashi A. Kang M.I. Okawa H. Ohtsuji M. Zenke Y. Chiba T. Igarashi K. Yamamoto M. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 2003; 425: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the function of BTB-kelch proteins in vivo. So far, four BTB-kelch proteins have been knocked out in mice. Deletion of Keap1 results in postnatal lethality due to the constitutive activation of Nrf2 (10Wakabayashi N. Itoh K. Wakabayashi J. Motohashi H. Noda S. Takahashi S. Imakado S. Kotsuji T. Otsuka F. Roop D.R. Harada T. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Nat. Genet. 2003; 35: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Male mice that are haploinsufficient for the BTB-kelch protein KLHL10 are infertile (11Yan W. Ma L. Burns K.H. Matzuk M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 7793-7798Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Loss of the kelch domain-containing protein Nd1 leads to the lack of an overt phenotype in mice; however, it has been reported that Nd1 plays a protective role in doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxic responses (12Fujimura L. Matsudo Y. Kang M. Takamori Y. Tokuhisa T. Hatano M. Cardiovasc. Res. 2004; 64: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Finally, we have recently shown that KLHL6 regulates B-lymphocyte receptor signaling and formation of germinal centers in mice (13Kroll J. Shi X. Caprioli A. Liu H.H. Waskow C. Lin K.M. Miyazaki T. Rodewald H.R. Sato T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8531-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The BTB-kelch protein leucine zipper-like transcriptional regulator 1 (LZTR-1) was identified some years ago as a gene that is hemizygously deleted in the majority of DiGeorge syndrome patients (14Kurahashi H. Akagi K. Inazawa J. Ohta T. Niikawa N. Kayatani F. Sano T. Okada S. Nishisho I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Symptoms of DiGeorge syndrome are congenital immunodeficiency and congenital heart disease, which are caused by a large deletion from chromosome 22 (15Lindsay E.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2001; 2: 858-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 16Scambler P.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 2421-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Because of the weak homology of LZTR-1 to known members of the basic leucine zipper-like family, LZTR-1 has been proposed to act as a transcriptional regulator (14Kurahashi H. Akagi K. Inazawa J. Ohta T. Niikawa N. Kayatani F. Sano T. Okada S. Nishisho I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the cellular localization and the biological function of LZTR-1 are not known. Therefore, we have pursued cellular localization and initial functional experiments to gain further insights into the role of LZTR-1. Here, we have characterized LZTR-1 on a cellular level and show that LZTR-1 is a novel Golgi matrix-associated protein. Furthermore, we show for the first time that the second BTB/POZ domain mediates the binding of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex and that LZTR-1 is cleaved upon induction of apoptosis.

The correct sequence of all constructs was confirmed by sequencing. Generation of a Polyclonal Antiserum—A polyclonal antiserum was generated against the peptide NH2-VQPSSDSEVGGAEVPE-CONH2, coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin and injected into rabbits (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). Sera from final bleeds were affinity-purified against the peptide using the AminoLink ® Plus immobilization kit (Pierce). Immunostaining of Cells—Cells were seeded on coverslips and fixed in 100% methanol (-20 °C) for 5 min or 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min, respectively. Thereafter, paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized for 10 min using 0.3% Triton X-100/PBS followed by a blocking step in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS for 30 min for all cells. Cells were incubated with monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (clone 9E10), polyclonal rabbit anti-human LZTR-1, sheep anti-human TGN46 (Serotec, Duesseldorf, Germany), mouse anti-human Golgin-97 (Invitrogen), or mouse anti-human GM130 (BD Biosciences) antibodies for 90 min in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS at room temperature.

Transfection of HeLa and HEK Cells—Transient transfections of HeLa cells and HEK were performed in 6-well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells (5 × 105) were seeded and transfected the next day using 6 μg of plasmid DNA and 4 μl of Lipofectamine 2000. Four hours later, the transfection medium was replaced by fresh growth medium, and cells were cultured for another 24 h.

For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were incubated for 120 min at 4 °C in presence of the anti-Myc antibody and protein G-agarose (Roche Applied Science) followed by Western blot using the anti-phosphotyrosine-specific antibody PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells and HEK cells was confirmed by Western blots using the PARP antibody (Biomol, Hamburg, Germany). The anti-actin antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Identification of LZTR-1—We have recently shown that BTB-kelch protein KLHL6 is specifically expressed in embryonic endothelial cells but not in adult endothelial cells in mice (13Kroll J. Shi X. Caprioli A. Liu H.H. Waskow C. Lin K.M. Miyazaki T. Rodewald H.R. Sato T.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8531-8540Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To identify novel kelch proteins in the vascular system, we analyzed the expression of all 71 human kelch proteins (4Prag S. Adams J.C. BMC Bioinformatics 2003. 2003; (4/42)Google Scholar) by RT-PCR in different vascular cell types including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. As a result of this screen, we identified the expression of LZTR-1 in these cell types. LZTR-1 Is an Unusual BTB-kelch Protein—Human LZTR-1 consists of 840 amino acids and contains six kelch motifs and two BTB domains (Fig. 1). In contrast to all other known BTB-kelch-motif containing proteins, LZTR-1 has its kelch motifs in the N terminus and its BTB/POZ domains in the C terminus (Fig. 1). Furthermore, LZTR-1 lacks the BACK domain which is present in most other BTB-kelch proteins. Lastly, LZTR-1 contains an additional translational start site, as indicated by the Kozak sequences at position 289 (Fig. 1), suggesting that LZTR-1 may be expressed in two isoforms. Cloning and Expression of LZTR-1—We cloned full-length LZTR-1 as well as the putative short isoform of LZTR-1 (for details see “Experimental Procedures”) and expressed both constructs in HeLa cells. Subsequently, we analyzed its expression by anti-Myc Western blot (Fig. 2A). The construct encoding the putative short isoform of LZTR-1 generates a signal with an apparent molecular mass of 65 kDa (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the construct encoding for the full-length sequence of LZTR-1 runs at 95 kDa but lacks an additional band at 65 kDa, which would result from the second translation start site within the fifth kelch motif at position 289 (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that the putative short isoform of LZTR-1 is not expressed. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that this second translation start site is used under other conditions. Next, we analyzed several mouse tissues (Fig. 2B) for the expression of LZTR-1 by RT-PCR. LZTR-1 was detectable in all tissues and organs indicating its ubiquitous expression. Moreover, we analyzed different human vascular cells and tumor cells for the expression of LZTR-1 and found LZTR-1 expression in all analyzed cell lines (Fig. 2C). Additionally, we stimulated the vascular cells with certain activators such as VEGF, bFGF, and PDGF-BB and with the hypoxia-mimicking agent CoCl2, but we did not observe differences in the intensity of expression (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the data indicate that LZTR-1 is a ubiquitously expressed molecule. Generation and Characterization of a LZTR-1-specific Antiserum— To pursue the cellular characterization of LZTR-1, we generated a polyclonal antiserum. We have chosen a peptide that is a part of the fifth kelch motif within LZTR-1 (Figs. 1 and 3A). To test the specificity and sensitivity of the antiserum, CHO cells were transfected with a C-terminal Myc-tagged full-length LZTR-1 construct, and anti-LZTR-1 and anti-Myc staining was performed. As shown in Fig. 3B, anti-Myc staining of LZTR-1-transfected CHO cells identified several positive cells, indicating the presence of the Myc-tagged LZTR-1 expression construct. Next, we used the affinity-purified LZTR-1 antiserum to co-stain LZTR-1 transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3B). The polyclonal antiserum recognized only the LZTR-1-transfected CHO cells and not the untransfected cells, as indicated by merged images of the anti-Myc and anti-LZTR-1 staining (Fig. 3B). To further demonstrate the specificity of the antiserum, we expressed the C-terminal Myc-tagged mutant LZTR1–1Δkelch, which lacks the antibody recognition site within LZTR-1. Expression of mutant LZTR-1Δkelch in CHO cells and subsequent staining using the anti-Myc and anti-LZTR-1 antibodies resulted in Myc-positive, LZTR-1-negative cells (Fig. 3B). These data demonstrate the specificity and sensitivity of the LZTR-1 antiserum. We also tested the ability of the antiserum to recognize LZTR-1 by Western blot analysis. Myc-tagged LZTR-1-transfected CHO cells, mock-transfected CHO cells, and CHO cells transfected with a Myc-tagged deletion mutant of angiopoietin-2 (19Maisonpierre P.C. Suri C. Jones P.F. Bartunkova S. Wiegand S.J. Radziejewski C. Compton D. McClain J. Aldrich T.H. Papadopoulos N. Daly T.J. Davis S. Sato T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1997; 277: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (2954) Google Scholar) were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-Myc and the anti-LZTR-1 antiserum. The anti-Myc antibody recognizes a 95-kDa signal in the LZTR-1-transfected CHO cells and a 30-kDa signal for angiopoietin-2 in transfected CHO cells (Fig. 3C, left panel). In contrast, the LZTR-1 antiserum only recognizes the 95-kDa band of LZTR-1 but not of angiopoietin-2 (Fig. 3C, right panel). These data show the specificity of the LZTR-1 antiserum in Western blot analysis. LZTR-1 Is a Novel Golgi Matrix-associated Protein—To analyze the cellular localization of LZTR-1, we stained several cell lines using the LZTR-1-specific antiserum. Initial results showed the localization of LZTR-1 in the perinuclear region of the cells, which prompted us to hypothesize that LZTR-1 localizes to the Golgi complex or to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To test this hypothesis, we examined LZTR-1 localization in HUASMC, HUVECs, and HeLa cells (Fig. 4A) by confocal microscopy. The LZTR-1 antiserum recognized distinct perinuclear structures that were also recognized by the anti-GM130 antibody (20Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar), which marked the Golgi complex in all three cell types. The merged picture of antibody stainings clearly indicated co-localization of LZTR-1 with GM130 (Fig. 4A). Similar results were obtained by using anti-Golgin-97 antibody (21Barr F.A. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 381-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 22Griffith K.J. Chan E.K. Lung C.C. Hamel J.C. Guo X. Miyachi K. Fritzler M.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1693-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 1) and the Golgi marker TGN46 (23Prescott A.R. Lucocq J.M. James J. Lister J.M. Ponnambalam S. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1997; 72: 238-246PubMed Google Scholar) (data not shown) together with LZTR-1. In contrast, we did not observe a co-localization of LZTR-1 with the ER marker calreticulin (data not shown). Thus, LZTR-1 localizes to the Golgi network and is hereby identified as a new Golgi protein. In addition, LZTR-1 is the first known BTB-kelch protein that localizes exclusively to the Golgi complex. In contrast to many known BTB-kelch proteins (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), LZTR-1 does not co-localize with actin, as examined by anti-LZTR-1 and phalloidin double staining and confocal microscopy (Fig. 4B), suggesting that it does not directly interact with actin. Next, we treated the cells for 60 min with brefeldin A, which blocks protein transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus and induces morphological changes such as the collapse of the Golgi stacks. Moreover, in brefeldin A-treated cells, Golgi enzymes are redistributed back to the ER, most Coat proteins to the cytoplasm, and a growing number of Golgi matrix proteins to Golgi “remnants” and/or ER exit sites (24Hicks S.W. Machamer C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35833-35839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Subsequent analysis of the brefeldin A-treated cells showed a collapse and punctuated dispersion of the Golgi. Double staining using Golgi matrix protein marker GM130 together with LZTR-1 shows a complete merge of punctuate structures after brefeldin A treatment (Fig. 4A). Therefore, LZTR-1 does not redistribute to the ER but remains with the Golgi remnants. These data demonstrate that LZTR-1 localizes to the Golgi complex and identifies LZTR-1 as a Golgi matrix-associated protein. The Second BTB/POZ Domain Is Essential and Sufficient for the Localization of LZTR-1 to the Golgi—To identify the LZTR-1 region mediating the localization to the Golgi, we generated three deletion mutants of LZTR-1 (Fig. 5A). Mutant LZTR-1ΔBTB/POZ2 lacks the second BTB/POZ domain, mutant LZTR-1Δkelch lacks all six kelch motifs, and mutant LZTR-1BTB/POZ2 contains only the second BTB/POZ domain. We expressed these mutant proteins as well as full-length LZTR-1 in HeLa cells and identified their expression by an anti-Myc Western blot (Fig. 5B), demonstrating the correct expression of all transfected constructs. Next, we expressed the mutants and the full-length LZTR-1 clone in HeLa cells and subsequently analyzed the localization of the mutants by anti-TGN46 staining for Golgi localization and anti-Myc staining by confocal microscopy. Full-length LZTR-1 co-localized with TGN46 in HeLa cells (Fig. 5C). Mutant LZTR-1Δkelch and LZTR-1BTB/POZ2 showed the same staining pattern as the full-length LZTR-1. In contrast, mutant LZTR-1ΔBTB/POZ2 did not co-localize with the Golgi marker TGN46 and was widely distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cells (Fig. 5C). To further prove binding of the second BTB/POZ domain of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex, we generated a fusion protein consisting of GFP and the second BTB/POZ domain of LZTR-1. Overexpression in HeLa cells localized the GFP-BTB/POZ2 construct to the Golgi complex as indicated by GM130 staining (Fig. 5D, upper panel). In contrast, GFP alone resides in the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5D, lower panel). Therefore, the second BTB/POZ domain of LZTR-1 is necessary and sufficient for the localization of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing that a BTB/POZ domain mediates a protein localization to the Golgi complex. Induction of Apoptosis by Staurosporine, TNFα, and TRAIL Induces Degradation of LZTR-1 by Caspase- and Proteasome-dependent Pathways—Recent studies have shown that the induction of apoptosis leads to the Golgi fragmentation that is characterized by the conversion of the Golgi ribbon to tubulovesicular membrane clusters (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Fragmentation of the Golgi complex is accompanied by the cleavage of some Golgi matrix proteins such as GRASP65, which has been identified as a substrate for caspase-3 (26Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To address whether LZTR-1 is cleaved in response to apoptosis induction, we incubated LZTR-1-transfected HeLa cells for 4 h with staurosporine, for 8 h with TNFα, or for 4 h with TRAIL plus cycloheximide to induce apoptosis (17Bartke T. Pohl C. Pyrowolakis G. Jentsch S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 801-811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We then examined the status of the LZTR-1 protein by Western blot using the anti-Myc antibody. Treating cells with staurosporine, TNFα, or TRAIL plus cycloheximide induced degradation of LZTR-1 (Fig. 6A, upper panel). In contrast, incubating lysates of LZTR-1-transfected HEK cells with cytochrome c did not induce degradation of LZTR-1, indicating that degradation of LZTR-1 does not occur downstream of the mitochondrial pathway (Fig. 6A, upper panel). To further evaluate the degradation of LZTR-1, we analyzed different time points of staurosporine treatment and determined that 50% of LZTR-1 is cleaved after ∼60 min (Fig. 6B). In all of the degradation experiments, induction of apoptosis was confirmed by analyzing the lysates with an antibody recognizing the intact 116-kDa fragment (corresponding to nonapoptotic cells) and cleaved 85-kDa fragment (corresponding to apoptotic cells) of PARP (Fig. 6, A–D, middle panels). To further analyze the pathways that mediate the degradation of LZTR-1 upon apoptosis induction, LZTR-1-expressing HeLa cells were incubated for 1 h prior to stimulation with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (27Lowe M. Lane J.D. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1139-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and one of two proteasome inhibitors, MG132 or lactacystin (28Keller J.N. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 436-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the presence of the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk, staurosporine-induced degradation of LZTR-1 was partially rescued (Fig. 6C). Furthermore, preincubation of LZTR-1-overexpressing HeLa cells with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystin and MG132 rescued the degradation of LZTR-1 upon staurosporine stimulation (Fig. 6C). These data show that LZTR-1 is cleaved by caspase- and proteasome-dependent pathways upon apoptosis induction. In addition, we determined whether LZTR-1 is phosphorylated upon induction of apoptosis, which represents a common pathway to unmask a normally hidden degradation signal within a protein. LZTR-1-transfected HeLa cells were stimulated with staurosporine for different amounts of time, and phosphorylation of LZTR-1 was determined by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot. As shown in Fig. 6D, staurosporine induced a tyrosine phosphorylation of LZTR-1 after 30 min. It is interesting that phosphorylated LZTR-1 was not longer detectable after 60 min, although some LZTR-1 protein was still present (Fig. 6B). This shows that degradation of LZTR-1 is accompanied by its phosphorylation and suggests that tyrosine phosphorylation of LZTR-1 is a prerequisite for its degradation. Herein we have characterized the BTB-kelch protein LZTR-1 on the cellular level and report that: 1) LZTR-1 is ubiquitously expressed; 2) LZTR-1 is a novel Golgi matrix-associated molecule; 3) LZTR-1 is the first known BTB-kelch protein that exclusively localizes to the Golgi complex; 4) the second BTB/POZ domain of LZTR-1 mediates localization of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex, therefore showing for the first time that a BTB/POZ domain is involved in protein localization to the Golgi complex; and 5) LZTR-1 is cleaved by caspases- and proteasome-dependent pathways upon induction of apoptosis. Members of the kelch protein superfamily show a high structural as well as functional diversity. The number of kelch motifs varies between four and seven, and the kelch motifs can be localized at the N and/or C terminus. Although kelch proteins have diverse activities, some members, mostly BTB-kelch proteins, interact with actin and play a role in actin stabilization and organization. In addition, other members of the kelch protein family show a cytoplasmic or nuclear localization and elicit different biological functions (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Therefore, a direct correlation between structure and function does not exist within this family. However, most known kelch proteins interact with structural components of the cell and regulate cellular architecture and cellular organization (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Here, we report the ubiquitous expression of the unusual BTB-kelch protein LZTR-1, which, in contrast to all known BTB-kelch proteins, has its six kelch motifs at the N terminus and its two BTB/POZ domains at the C terminus. Furthermore, LZTR-1 does not co-localize with actin, which indicates that it is not involved in the organization and stabilization of the cytoskeleton as it has been reported on other BTB-kelch proteins (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). We examined the cellular localization of LZTR-1 and determined that this novel BTB-kelch protein co-localizes with the Golgi marker GM130, Golgin-97, and TGN46, indicating that LZTR-1 localizes to the Golgi complex. This is a clear difference from all other BTB-kelch proteins, which show mostly a cytoplasmic distribution (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Moreover, LZTR-1 is a Golgi matrix-associated protein because it was punctuated throughout the cytoplasm upon brefeldin A treatment and still co-localized with GM130. Taken together, the data identify LZTR-1 as the first known BTB-kelch protein that exclusively localizes to the Golgi complex. Thus far, only a portion of BTB-kelch protein Gigaxonin has been identified at the Golgi complex and ER (29Cullen V.C. Brownlees J. Banner S. Anderton B.H. Leigh P.N. Shaw C.E. Miller C.C. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 873-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). As a consequence, LZTR-1 could stabilize the Golgi complex as other BTB-kelch proteins stabilize cellular architecture by interacting with structural proteins (2Adams J. Kelso R. Cooley L. Trends Cell. Biol. 2000; 10: 17-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition to describing the localization of LZTR-1 to the Golgi complex, we have also demonstrated that the second BTB/POZ domain of LZTR-1 mediates the localization to the Golgi. This is an unexpected finding, as for the first time it shows that a BTB/POZ domain mediates a Golgi complex localization. Furthermore, the data indicate that LZTR-1 is localized on the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi complex because the truncated mutant LZTR-1ΔBTB/POZ2 was dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. Thus, we are establishing the BTB/POZ domain as a novel Golgi localization domain. So far, the BTB/POZ domain has been described as mediating a homomeric dimerization of proteins, and BTB/POZ-containing proteins act as transcriptional regulators (30Kelly K.F. Otchere A.A. Graham M. Daniel J.M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 6143-6152Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown that the BTB/POZ domain defines a recognition motif for the assembly of substrate-specific RING/cullin/BTB ubiquitin ligase complex (31Geyer R. Wee S. Anderson S. Yates J. Wolf D.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 783-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Morphological studies have shown that induction of apoptosis leads to the fragmentation of the Golgi complex (25Mancini M. Machamer C.E. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Casciola-Rosen L.A. Rosen A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 603-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 32Sesso A. Fujiwara D.T. Jaeger M. Jaeger R. Li T.C. Monteiro M.M. Correa H. Ferreira M.A. Schumacher R.I.

Neurosci. 1996; 8: 1906-1915Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear why the Golgi complex is fragmented during apoptosis, a recent report shows that stacking protein GRASP65, but not GRASP55, is cleaved upon apoptosis induction and that cleavage of GRASP65 is required for Golgi fragmentation (26Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been suggested that other Golgi molecules are cleaved during apoptosis (26Lane J.D. Lucocq J. Pryde J. Barr F.A. Woodman P.G. Allan V.J. Lowe M. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 495-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). We have now identified a novel Golgi protein, LZTR-1, that is rapidly cleaved upon apoptosis induction by caspases- and proteasome-dependent pathways. In addition, LZTR-1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, suggesting that phosphorylation of LZTR-1 provides a signal for its degradation. According to the idea that LZTR-1 is an important structural component of the Golgi complex, one could speculate that the cleavage of LZTR-1 is a requirement for the fragmentation of the Golgi complex. However, further experiments need to be done to prove this hypothesis. Interestingly, the BTB-kelch protein IPP (34Kim I.F. Mohammadi E. Huang R.C. Gene. 1999; 228: 73-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) is not degraded upon apoptosis induction, 3T. G. Nacak and J. Kroll, unpublished data. indicating that degradation of BTB-kelch proteins upon apoptosis induction is not a common mechanism and suggesting a distinct role of LZTR-1 within the BTB-kelch protein superfamily during apoptosis. LZTR-1 was first described some years ago as a gene deleted in seven of eight DiGeorge syndrome patients. Furthermore, because of the weak homology of LZTR-1 to known members of the basic leucine zipper-like family, it has been proposed that LZTR-1 acts as a transcriptional regulator (14Kurahashi H. Akagi K. Inazawa J. Ohta T. Niikawa N. Kayatani F. Sano T. Okada S. Nishisho I. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, because of its exclusive localization to the Golgi complex it seems unlikely that LZTR-1 acts as a transcriptional regulator. Taken together, we have identified LZTR-1 as the first BTB-kelch protein exclusively localized to the Golgi complex. Further studies will now be undertaken to reveal the exact function of LZTR-1 for the Golgi complex. We are grateful to Dr. Christopher L.

Gene nblA, present in all phycobilisome-containing organisms, encodes a protein of about 7 kDa that plays a key role in phycobilisome degradation. The mode of action of NblA in this degradation process is poorly understood. Here we presented the 1.8-Å crystal structure of NblA from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120. In the crystal, NblA is present as a four-helix bundle formed by dimers, the basic structural units. By using pull-down assays with immobilized NblA and peptide scanning, we showed that NblA specifically binds to the α-subunits of phycocyanin and phycoerythrocyanin, the main building blocks of the phycobilisome rod structure. By site-directed mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues in NblA that are involved in phycobilisome binding. The results provided evidence that NblA is directly involved in phycobilisome degradation, and the results allowed us to present a model that gives insight into the interaction of this small protein with the phycobilisomes.

Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic prokaryotes, which perform planttype oxygenic photosynthesis. Light harvesting in these organisms is mainly mediated by phycobilisomes, large water-soluble multiprotein complexes that are attached to the cytoplasmic surface of the photosynthetic membrane. Phycobilisomes are composed of brilliantly colored phycobiliproteins, to which open chain tetrapyrrole chromophores are covalently attached, and of linker proteins, which, with one exception, do not contain chromophores (1Glazer A.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1982; 36: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). A typical cyanobacterial phycobilisome is assembled by two domains, a central triangular core from which six or more peripheral rods radiate in a hemidiscoidal array. The most abundant phycobiliproteins in a phycobilisome are allophycocyanin, which is present in the core, and phycocyanin, which is present in the rods. Some species also contain phycoerythrin or, like Anabaena, phycoerythrocyanin in their rods. All phycobiliproteins have a common subunit organization that consists of α- and β-subunits forming a heterodimer (see Fig. 6). These so-called αβ monomers form disk-shaped trimers, (αβ)3. By face-to-face aggregation of two trimers, hexamers (αβ)6 are formed that are assembled into the rod and core structures through interaction with linker proteins (1Glazer A.N. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1982; 36: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 2Grossman A.R. Bhaya D. He Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11449-11452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In cell extracts, the phycobilisomes dissociate into subcomplexes like hexamers and trimers unless special buffers of high ionic strength, like 0.8 m phosphate plus 0.3 m citrate, stabilize them. Phycobiliproteins can constitute up to 50% of the total soluble protein of a cyanobacterial cell. Together with chlorophyll, they are causal for the typical blue-green color of cyanobacteria. Upon changes in environmental conditions like nitrogen starvation, cyanobacteria rapidly degrade their phycobilisomes, which helps to prevent photodamage under stress and provides a large pool of nitrogen-containing substances for adaptation. Phycobilisome degradation is an ordered proteolytic process visible by a color change of the cyanobacterial cell from blue-green to yellow-green, referred to as bleaching or chlorosis (3Allen M.M. Smith A.J. Arch. Microbiol. 1969; 69: 114-120Google Scholar). A key role in phycobilisome degradation is played by a small protein of about 7 kDa, NblA (Nbl stands for non-bleaching). Homologs of the nblA gene are found in all phycobilisome-containing organisms, including red algae. Mutations of nblA lead to a nonbleaching phenotype under nitrogen-limiting conditions in non-diazotrophic strains like Synechococcus 7942 3The abbreviations used are: Synechococcus 7942, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942; Anabaena 7120, Anabaena sp.

Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 178: 256-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In diazotrophic, filamentous cyanobacteria such as Anabaena, this nonbleaching phenotype is most obvious in heterocysts (8Baier K. Lehmann H. Stephan D.P. Lockau W. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), differentiated cells specialized for fixing N2. Heterocysts are usually devoid of phycobiliproteins. One of the first responses to nitrogen deprivation in all examined cyanobacterial species is the expression of the nblA gene. However, it is poorly understood how the NblA protein leads to phycobilisome degradation. NblA shows no sequence similarity to proteins with known function and has no detectable proteolytic activity. Among several hypotheses, Collier and Grossman (4Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) suggested that NblA could tag or disrupt the phycobilisome, rendering it susceptible to degradation. In support of this suggestion, Luque et al. (9Luque I. Ochoa De Alda J.A. Richaud C. Zabulon G. Thomas J.C. Houmard J. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) found that NblA binds to phycobiliproteins from the filamentous cyanobacterium Tolypothrix PCC 7601, preferentially to the α-subunits of phycocyanin and phycoerythrin. Here we present the crystal structure of NblA from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 together with biochemical data that map the sites of interaction of NblA with phycobiliproteins. NblA Overexpression and Purification—The chromosomal gene asr4517 coding for NblA (kazusa.or.jp/cyano/Anabaena/index.html) from Anabaena 7120 was cloned into plasmid pET11a (Novagen) as described earlier (10Strauss H. Misselwitz R. Labudde D. Nicklisch S. Baier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). A selenomethionine (Mse) NblA derivative was produced in Escherichia coli B834 (DE3), which is auxotrophic for methionine, according to a protocol from Budisa et al. (11Budisa N. Steipe B. Demange P. Eckerskorn C. Kellermann J. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 788-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). NblA was purified via ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by size exclusion (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) and anion exchange (HiTrap Q, Amersham Biosciences) chromatography. The final protein concentrations used for crystallization ranged from 7 to 13 mg ml-1 in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. The completeness of Mse incorporation was judged by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (data not shown). Crystallization and Structure Determination—Crystals were grown using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method over a reservoir solution containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm MgCl2, 10% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol)2000, and 15% ethylene glycol at 20 °C. NblA crystals grew as long but thin rods (1.0 × 0.15 × 0.05 mm3) and belong to the monoclinic space group P21 as suggested by the data processing software and confirmed by inspection of pseudo-precession images, which indicated unambiguously the Laue group 2/m and the reflection conditions k = 2n for 0k0. Furthermore, attempts to merge the diffraction data in higher symmetry space groups failed. The asymmetric unit contains 12 NblA monomers (randomly denoted as A to L) in the asymmetric unit. The solvent content of the crystals is 47%, corresponding to a VM = 2.34 Å3 Da-1 (12Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7894) Google Scholar). Two data sets were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France) beam line ID14-4 from flash-frozen crystals at 100 K. Diffraction data were reduced and scaled using the programs XDS and XSCALE (13Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3200) Google Scholar), respectively (for statistics see Table 1). The structure was solved using the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique. A data set with moderate resolution (2.12 Å) was collected at the peak wavelength of 0.9794 Å as determined with a fluorescence scan from a crystal with cell parameters of a = 43.1 Å, b = 96.5 Å, c = 105.2 Å, and β = 96.9°. A second data set with higher resolution (1.8 Å) was collected at a remote wavelength (0.9393 Å) from a crystal with parameters of a = 43.2 Å, b = 95.9 Å, c = 104.8 Å, and β = 97.0°. The positions of 24 of 36 possible selenium sites were found using the program SOLVE (14Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3216) Google Scholar). The program RESOLVE (15Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1628) Google Scholar, 16Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar) was used to improve the initial phases and to build a starting model of NblA. About 60% of the residues could be traced automatically by the program. To complete the structure determination, multiple cycles of manual model building in O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) were followed by refinement with maximum likelihood methods using the CCP4 program REFMAC5 (18Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Refinement was continued with data from the second set up to 1.8-Å resolution with the model derived from the first data set, starting with a few cycles of rigid-body refinement. Automatic building of the solvent structure was performed using the program ARP/wARP (19Perrakis A. Harkiolaki M. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1445-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The structure of NblA was initially refined to Rwork = 0.199 and Rfree = 0.241. However, by using the TLS refinement strategy (20Winn M.D. Isupov M.N. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 122-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar), these values could be further decreased to 0.182 and 0.217 for Rwork and Rfree, respectively. For this purpose, each of the six dimers in the asymmetric unit was divided into three segments. The first TLS group consisted of residues 10-25 of both dimer-forming NblA monomers; TLS groups two and three were formed by residues 26-50 of each monomer. The residues at the termini were not included in TLS refinement because of their high flexibility and resulting high individual atomic displacement factors. All molecular drawings were produced with MolMol (21Koradi R. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 51-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (6454) Google Scholar) and Pov-Ray. 4POV-ray, version 3.6, Persistence of Vision Pty. Ltd.

Open table in a new tab Expression, Purification, and Site-directed Mutagenesis of GST-tagged NblA—The chromosomal nblA gene (asr4517) was PCR-amplified from total Anabaena 7120 DNA using the following primers: 5′-GTC TTT TAG GGATCC GTT ATG AAC C-3′, incorporating a BamHI site, and 5′-G CGA CAC ATA GGAATTCTA TGC CGG-3′, incorporating an EcoRI site. The PCR fragment was ligated into plasmid pGEX-2TK (Amersham Biosciences) to yield plasmid pBB10. By using plasmid pBB10 as template, primers were designed to produce sitespecific mutations, and mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange ® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). All of the DNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GST-NblA fusion protein and its variants were expressed and purified according to the manufacturer’s directions for GST expression and purification systems (Amersham Biosciences). In Vitro Binding Assay Using GST Fusion Protein—GST-NblA or its variants were bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B ® columns in PBS (140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4) and incubated with soluble crude extracts from Anabaena. Crude extracts were prepared as described earlier (8Baier K. Lehmann H. Stephan D.P. Lockau W. Microbiology. 2004; 150: 2739-2749Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). After extensive washing with PBS, proteins bound to the resins were eluted with 20 mm glutathione in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed in slab gels containing 15% (w/v) acrylamide:bisacrylamide (29:1) in the buffer system of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were transferred electrophoretically to nitrocellulose membranes. Phycocyanin subunits and GST were detected by specific antisera. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium as substrate. Peptide Blot Assay—Four peptide arrays were synthesized on a modified cellulose membrane using the SPOT synthesis technique (24Reineke U. Volkmer-Engert R. Schneider-Mergener J. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2001; 12: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). On each array, a set of overlapping 15-mer peptides was synthesized. The peptides represented the complete amino acid sequences of the entire α-chains and β-chains of phycocyanin and phycoerythrocyanin. A three-amino acid shift between neighboring peptides was used. The in vitro binding of NblA to the synthetic peptide arrays was analyzed as follows. The membrane was washed with ethanol and Trisbuffered saline (TBS) and was then blocked with blocking buffer as described (25Landgraf C. Panni S. Montecchi-Palazzi L. Castagnoli L. Schneider-Mergener J. Volkmer-Engert R. Cesareni G. PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: 94-103Crossref Scopus (183) Google Scholar). GST-fused NblA in blocking buffer was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml followed by overnight incubation at 4 °C. After three washings with TBS, an anti-GST monoclonal antibody (G1160; Sigma) was added to a concentration of 1 μg ml-1 in blocking buffer. After 2 h at room temperature, the membrane was washed with TBS, and a POD-labeled anti-mouse monoclonal antibody (1 μgml-1 in blocking buffer) was applied for 1.5 h at room temperature followed by washing with TBS. Binding of NblA was quantified using chemiluminescence substrate and the Lumi-Imager™ instrument (Roche Diagnostics). For quantification, the spot-signal intensities were measured in Boehringer light units. We used the intensity of background signal plus three times its standard deviation as the threshold for sufficient binding affinity on the cellulose membrane as described (26Weiser A.A. Or-Giul M. Tapia V. Leichesenring A. Schuchhardt J. Frömmel C. Volkmer-Engert R. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 342: 300-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 27Boisguerin P. Leben R. Ay B. Radziwill G.

To exclude false-positive results in the NblA incubation experiment, the membrane was pre-examined with GST/anti-GST and anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies. Crystal Structure of NblA from Anabaena sp. PCC 7120—Because Collier and Grossman (4Collier J.L. Grossman A.R. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported that the increased expression of gene nblA is responsible for phycobilisome degradation in Synechococcus 7942, homologous genes have been identified in other phycobilisomecontaining species of cyanobacteria and red algae (Fig. 1). Although the sequence identities are not very high among the members of the NblA family (about 30% sequence identity on average), they seem to share structural similarity. Both CD spectroscopy (10Strauss H. Misselwitz R. Labudde D. Nicklisch S. Baier K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 4617-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and PHD (28Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar) secondary structure predictions (data not shown) suggest that they are mostly α-helical proteins. In order to get more insights into the function of NblA, we determined the crystal structure of the protein from Anabaena 7120. The structure was determined at 1.8-Å resolution with the single-wavelength anomalous dispersion technique using a selenomethionine derivative of the protein. The quality check of the structure, using the programs PROCHECK (30Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and WHATCHECK (31Hooft R.W. Vriend G. Sander C. Abola E.E. Nature. 1996; 381: 272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1788) Google Scholar), indicated good agreement between stereochemical parameters of the experimental structure and expected ones (32Engh A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2533) Google Scholar). In the Ramachandran diagram (33Ramachandran G. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar), all residues were in the energetically preferred areas with the exception of one residue located in the generously allowed region and 8 of 584 which were in the additional allowed region, as defined by PROCHECK (for further statistics see Table 1). In the current model of the NblA structure, between 1 and 6 N-terminal residues and between 7 and 11 C-terminal residues are disordered and not visible in the electron density (see Table 2) in the 12 different NblA chains present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal. This observation is also manifested in the increase of individual atomic displacement factors at the ends of the polypeptide chains that are not stabilized by secondary structure. In addition to the 12 polypeptide chains, 254 water molecules and 2 ethylene glycol molecules were built into the electron density. The conformation of the 12 molecules is similar with a mean r.m.s.d. for all 66 possible pairwise superpositions (using Cα atoms from residue 7-54) of 1.14 Å as calculated by LSQKAB (34Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1976; 32: 922-923Crossref Scopus (2274) Google Scholar), with small structural differences in chains C, F, I, and L. In the asymmetric unit, six dimers were found assembling to two compact hexamers (chains A, B; C, D; K, L, G, H; I, J; E, F; see supplemental Fig. 1), which are related by a noncrystallographic dyad axis defined by the polar angles ω = 94.2°, ϕ =-90.4°, and κ = 179.1°. The angle ω = 94.2° indicates a tilt of 4.2° relative to the b axis of the unit cell. Therefore, this (pseudo-) dyad cannot be a crystallographic axis. The dimers differ by a mean r.m.s.d. value of 1.28 Å, and the hexamers are similar to each other with an r.m.s.d. of 0.63 Å.TABLE 2Defined residues in the structureChain IDABCDEFGHIJKLResidue range5-565-546-582-575-545-544-565-544-577-577-565-54 Open table in a new tab The small NblA polypeptide of 65 amino acids consists of two α-helices that are assembled at an ∼37° angle in an antiparallel, V-shaped arrangement. The first helix, α1, extends from Ser8 to Gln23, Asn24, or Met25, and the second helix, α2, from Ser26 to Lys53, His54, or Gln56, depending on the monomer that is considered. Internal stabilization of the molecules is provided by a backbone hydrogen pattern that is typical for α-helices. The short helix α1 is capped N-terminally by Ser8 that is hydrogen-bonded to the amide nitrogen of Gln11. For further stabilization of this part of the helix, there is a hydrogen bond between the carbonyl oxygen of the side chain of Gln11 and the amide nitrogen of Ser8. A very similar arrangement is found at the N terminus of the long helix α2, with a serine at position 26 that forms a hydrogen bond to the amide nitrogen of Gln29 via its Oγ and a hydrogen bond between O∈ of Gln and the amide nitrogen of Ser26. The bend between the two helices is formed by residues 24-26, whereas the residues Met25 and Ser26 adopt ϕ and ψ torsion angles similar to those found in polyproline type II or polyglycine helices (ϕ ∼-80° and ψ ∼ 158°). In most molecules the bend and/or the end of helix α1 is stabilized by a hydrogen bond between the amide nitrogen of Asn24 and the carbonyl oxygen of Thr20. Two NblA monomers form the basic structural unit of NblA, a fourhelix bundle with the tips of the V superimposing on the same side of a dimer (Figs. 2 and 3). The dimer is formed by two molecules related by a noncrystallographic dyad axis, and the contacts of the two monomers shield on average 1553 Å2 per monomer from the solvent, corresponding to 30% of the total solvent-accessible surface per monomer. The two α2-helices are in contact with each other via Ala30, Leu34, Leu37, and Mse41 of each chain forming a prolate hydrophobic surface that is flanked on both sides by Ile15, Phe18, and Val22 from the two α1-helices to build up the hydrophobic core, including Val35 (Fig. 3, box A). Here, Phe18 interacts with Tyr38 via the aromatic rings of their side chains, and the backbone of Mse25 as well as the long aliphatic parts of Lys31 shield the top of this hydrophobic core from the solvent. However, NblA does not possess a hydrophobic core in the classical sense because of the flat arrangement of the two monomers. In addition to the numerous hydrophobic interactions, the dimer is stabilized by just a very few polar contacts that are present in all six dimers. These exist between the carboxyl group of Glu45 from molecule A and the guanidinium moiety of Arg44 and the hydroxyl group of Tyr48 from molecule B. This polar network is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the side chain nitrogen atoms of Gln49 and the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr48 from the partner molecule and between the side chain nitrogen atoms of Gln49 and the carboxylate oxygen of Glu 45 within molecule A (Fig. 3, box B).FIGURE 3Structure of NblA dimer.

The affinity resin was incubated with total soluble proteins from Anabaena as described under “Experimental Procedures.” After extensive washing, the resins retained an intensive blue color, indicating a strong association of phycobiliproteins. Control resins to which only GST was immobilized remained colorless. After elution with glutathione, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4a). The eluted phycobiliproteins showed the typical zinc-enhanced fluorescence of biliproteins under ultraviolet illumination (Fig. 4a, lane 2). The polypeptide bands indicated on Fig. 4a, lane 1, were identified by peptide mass mapping as the α- and β-subunits of phycoerythrocyanin and phycocyanin, respectively (data not shown). A weak band migrating slightly faster than α-phycocyanin also showed zinc-enhanced fluorescence (Fig. 4a, lane 2). This band represents allophycocyanin, as proven by immunodetection with an anti-allophycocyanin antiserum and by binding of purified allophycocyanin subunits to the NblA affinity resins (data not shown). Identification of a Phycobiliprotein-binding Site on NblA—To identify the amino acid residues of NblA that are involved in its interaction with the phycobiliproteins, a series of site-directed mutants was generated. Selection of the positions of the amino acid residues that were replaced was guided by the conserved stretches of amino acid residues in NblA (Fig. 1), by the here-described structure of the protein, and by geometrical considerations that took into account the modeled three-dimensional structures of the binding partners of NblA, phycocyanin, and phycoerythrocyanin. The following NblA variants were generated: L7A, E10A/Q11A, and Q12A/F13A with mutations located in the N-terminal helix; E50A, L51A, and K53A in the C-terminal helix; and Q23S/N24S/H27A/D28A with four changed amino acids located in the loop between the two α-helices. Like the wild-type protein, the mutated variants of NblA were expressed as GST fusion proteins, and pull-down experiments were performed as described above. Fig. 4b shows a typical Western blot from five such experiments. Only two of the NblA variants showed a significantly changed affinity to phycobiliproteins. The NblA variant K53A did not bind phycobiliproteins, and variant L51A showed drastically lower binding. Amino acid residues Leu51 and Lys53 are located close to the C terminus, indicating that this region of NblA is responsible for binding to the phycobilisome. NblA variant K53A migrated somewhat faster in SDS-PAGE than wild-type NblA and the other mutated variants (Fig. 4b). Determination of the molecular mass of the K53A v"

TAP is formed by two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, each containing one multispanning transmembrane domain (TMD) and a cytosolic nucleotide binding domain. Here we reported that the blockade of TAP by gpUS6 is species-restricted, i.e. gpUS6 inhibits human TAP but not rat TAP. Co-expression of human and rat subunits of TAP demonstrates independent binding of gpUS6 to human TAP1 and TAP2, whereas gpUS6 does not bind to rat TAP subunits. gpUS6 associates with preformed TAP1/2 heterodimers but not with unassembled TAP subunits. To locate domains of TAP required for gpUS6 binding and function, we took advantage of reciprocal human/rat intrachain TAP chimeras. Each TAP subunit forms two contact sites within its TMD interacting with gpUS6. The dominant gpUS6-binding site on TAP2 maps to an N-terminal loop, whereas inhibition of peptide transport is mediated by a C-terminal loop of the TMD. For TAP1, two gpUS6 binding domains are formed by loops of the C-terminal TMD. The domain required for TAP inactivation is built by a distal loop of the C-terminal TMD, indicating a topology of TAP1 comprising 10 endoplasmic reticulum transmembrane segments.

TAP translocates 8–16-mer peptides generated in the cytosol across the ER membrane into the ER lumen for loading onto MHC class I molecules (1Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 68: 191-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Upon anchoring of the peptide, the MHC class I heavy chain and β2-microglobulin form a stable ternary complex that is released from the peptide loading complex consisting of TAP, tapasin, calreticulin, and the thioreductase ERp57 (3Bouvier M. Mol. Immunol. 2003; 39: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 4Momburg F. Tan P. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 217-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). MHC class I molecules carry the peptide to the cell surface for monitoring by CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes. TAP-deficient cells show drastically reduced levels of MHC class I surface expression indicating that TAP represents the principal source of peptide ligands. TAP is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, which utilize ATP energy for translocation of their substrates across membrane barriers. TAP is built by two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2, each consisting of one transmembrane domain (TMD) and one nucleotide binding domain (NBD). Peptide binding to TAP is dependent on the formation of heterodimers (5Androlewicz M.J. Ortmann B. van Endert P.M. Spies T. Cresswell P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12716-12720Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It was shown that the TMDs, and not the NBDs, of TAP1 and TAP2 encompass the peptide binding domain (6Arora S. Lapinski P.E. Raghavan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 7241-7246Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which has been mapped to the C-terminal cytosolic loops on both subunits (7Nijenhuis M. Hammerling G.J. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5467-5477PubMed Google Scholar). The NBDs harbor conserved sequence motifs required for ATP binding and hydrolysis (8Gaudet R. Wiley D.C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4964-4972Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). According to a recently proposed model for the peptide translocation cycle (9van Endert P.M. Saveanu L. Hewitt E.W. Lehner P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 454-461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), binding of ATP to TAP2 is needed for peptide binding to the transporter. This step is followed by ATP hydrolysis at TAP2, which allows ATP binding to TAP1 and conformational changes of TAP. The opening of the TAP pore is probably a consequence of ADP release at TAP2 and ATP hydrolysis at TAP1, which lowers the affinity for the peptide ligand and permits membrane translocation. Finally, according to this model, release of ADP from TAP1 resets the transport cycle. The lack of crystallographic data, hydrophobicity analysis, and sequence alignments with other ABC transporters have given the basis for a hypothetical model of the ER membrane topology predicting a core TMD with six transmembrane segments (TMSs) and an additional four and three N-terminal TMSs for TAP1 and TAP2, respectively (2Abele R. Tampe R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1461: 405-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Truncated TAP subunits containing only the putative core TMD were found recently to be functional in terms of peptide translocation (10Koch J. Guntrum R. Heintke S. Kyritsis C. Tampe R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10142-10147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In another study, however, analysis of glycosylation sites added to C-terminally truncated nonfunctional TAP mutants suggested the formation of only 8 TMSs for TAP1 and 7 TMSs for TAP2, whereas no evidence for the most C-terminal pair of TMSs was obtained (11Vos J.C. Spee P. Momburg F. Neefjes J. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 6679-6685PubMed Google Scholar). Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is equipped with various gene functions interfering with the MHC class I pathway of antigen presentation (12Hengel H. Brune W. Koszinowski U.H. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 190-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). One of them is the US6-encoded 21-kDa glycoprotein (gpUS6) that inhibits the translocation of peptides across the ER membrane (13Hengel H. Flohr T. Hammerling G.J. Koszinowski U.H. Momburg F. J. Gen.

The ER resident gpUS6 is a type I transmembrane protein, with a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane segment (TMS), and a bulky luminal part. It has been shown that a truncated gpUS6 mutant, lacking the TMS, is still able to bind and inactivate TAP (16Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y.

In contrast to gpUS6, the herpes simplex virus (HSV)-encoded protein ICP47 binds to TAP at the cytosolic side. ICP47 is a small soluble protein described to act as a high affinity competitive inhibitor of the peptide-binding site on TAP (19Tomazin R. Hill A.B. Jugovic P. York I. van Endert P. Ploegh H.L.

In this study we took advantage of the species-restricted specificity of gpUS6 for TAP; gpUS6 interacts with human TAP but not rat TAP. By constructing intrachain human/rat TAP chimeras, we define minimal gpUS6 binding domains on TAP and assess their relative contribution to the inactivation of the transporter. The data provide a model in which gpUS6 binds to distant, conformation-dependent ER-luminal loops of TAP1 and TAP2. gpUS6 forms oligomers revealing that gpUS6 forms a bridge between TAP1/2 subunits. Moreover, our study provides evidence for a TAP1 TMD structure consisting of 10 TMSs.

Anti-gpUS6 polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised by immunization of rabbits with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-coupled synthetic peptides of amino acids 77–95 of gpUS6. The monoclonal antibodies 148.3 and 439.3 were used as human TAP1- and TAP2-specific reagents, respectively, in Western blots (24Meyer T.H. van Endert P.M. Uebel S. Ehring B. Tampe R.

The conserved restriction site KpnI in human TAP1A cDNA (1137 in X57522)4 and rat TAP1a (905 in X57523) was used to generate the chimeric TAP1 r6hT1 and h6rT1 cDNAs. The restriction site BsiWI present in rat TAP1a (1106 in X57523) was introduced into human TAP1A by PCR mutagenesis (1338 in X57522).

The conserved restriction site SanDI in hTAP1a (1822 in X57522) and rTAP1a (1590 in X57523) was used for the construction of the chimeric TAP1 cDNA rxhT1. Human TAP2E (37Kelly A. Powis S.H. Kerr L.A.

The conserved sites BsaBI in hTAP2E (608 in Z22936) and rTAP2u (631 in X75307) were used to generate chimeric TAP2 cDNAs h4rT2 and r4hT2. The restriction site SalI present in rTAP2u (1184 in X75307) was introduced by PCR mutagenesis into hTAP2E (1161 in Z22936) (39Armandola E.A. Momburg F. Nijenhuis M. Bulbuc N. Fruh K. Hammerling G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and used to generate the chimeric rTAP2 cDNAs h7rT2 and r7hT2. All TAP1 and TAP2 constructs were cleaved from pBluescript II KS+ and subcloned into p7.5k131a using appropriate restriction sites. For the VR, amino acid substitution in the r8hT1 chimera mutations was inserted using the primers 5′-GGAGGCTGTGGCCTATGCAG-3′ and 5′-CTGCTTACAGCCCCTCTGACCACCAGCTGCCCACC-3′ (mutations underlined), and as a template r8hT1-p7.5k131A was used. The amplified product was used in a second PCR as a primer together with 5′-GCTGTGATTTCCTCCATAGTTGGC-3′ and again with r8hT1-p7.5k131A as template. The second PCR product was digested by the restriction enzymes SpeI and DraIII and ligated to r8hT1-p7.5k131A digested by the same enzymes. Generation of Recombinant Vaccinia Viruses—Construction of rVV was performed as described (40Volkmer H. Bertholet C. Jonjic S. Wittek R. Koszinowski U.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 166: 668-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Genes of interest inserted in p7.5k131A were transferred through homologous recombination into vaccinia virus genome (strain Copenhagen) by interrupting the thymidine kinase gene. rVV were selected by bromodeoxyuridine (100 μg/ml) using HU143tk– cells. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot—For binding analysis of gpUS6 to TAP, 106 CMT64.5 cells were infected by rVV at an m.o.i. of 5. At 15 h post-infection, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline before lysis on ice for 20 min in 600 μl of digitonin lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μm leupeptin, 1 μm pepstatin A, and 1% digitonin). Lysates were cleared from membrane debris at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. A 50-μl aliquot was stored for control of protein expression. Lysates were incubated with antibodies at 4 °C over night before immunocomplexes were retrieved by adding protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Sepharose pellets were washed three times, and immune complexes were dissociated by addition of sample buffer (80 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5 mm EDTA, 34% sucrose, 3.2% SDS, and 40 mm DTT) and incubation at 95 °C for 5 min. Under nonreducing conditions DTT was omitted. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a Protran membrane, and detected by specific antibodies followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and detection using the enhanced chemiluminescence substrate ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled proteins, cells were labeled for 1 h with 35S-labeled Redivue™ Pro-Mix™ (Amersham Biosciences) prior to lysis, performed as described above. 35S incorporation into proteins was quantitated in each experiment by liquid scintillation counting. Lysates were adjusted to ensure comparability in quantitative terms. Incubation with antibodies was reduced to 1 h. Immune complexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose and dissociated with sample buffer. Proteins were separated on a 10–13% gradient SDS-PAGE. Dried gels were exposed to BioMax MR films at–70 °C for 1–7 days. Peptide Translocation—Assays were performed essentially as described (41Neefjes J.J. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Science. 1993; 261: 769-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) using peptides labeled with 125I by chloramine-T-catalyzed iodination. The peptides used were as follows: RYWANATRSI for BALB/3T3 cells, RRYQNSTEL for HeLa and Rab9 cells, and TNKTRIDGQY for CV1, Rat2, 1T, and CMT64.5 cells. After trypsination cells were permeabilized with streptolysin-O (Murex Diagnostics Ltd.). 2 × 106 of CMT64.5 cells or 1.25 × 106 of other cells used were incubated with peptide and 10 mm ATP in 0.1 ml of translocation buffer (130 mm KCl, 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm EGTA 2 mm MgCl2) for 20 min at 37 °C. Following lysis in 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), the glycosylated peptide fraction was isolated with 30 μl of concanavalin A-Sepharose slurry (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by γ-counting. Concanavalin A-recovered counts/min were expressed as percentage of input counts/min. Inactivation of TAP by gpUS6 Is Species-restricted—Herpesviruses are pathogens with a long history of co-speciation with their host leading to a close adaptation of molecular functions. As a consequence, some of the herpesviral inhibitors of the MHC class I pathway, including the HSV-encoded inhibitor of TAP, ICP47 (21Ahn K. Meyer T.H. Uebel S. Sempe P. Djaballah H. Yang Y. Peterson P.A. Fruh K. Tampe R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3247-3255Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), exhibit a remarkable specificity regarding their target recognition (42Tomazin R. van Schoot N.E. Goldsmith K. Jugovic P. Sempe P. Fruh K. Johnson D.C. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2560-2563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether the HCMV-encoded TAP inhibitor gpUS6 is able to discriminate between TAP homologs of different species, cell lines derived from several mammalian species (human, African green monkey, rabbit, rat, and mouse) were infected either by an rVV expressing US6 (rVV-US6) or with WT VV. To assess translocation efficiency, peptides were selected that are know as good substrates for human/monkey TAP as well as rodent TAP (39Armandola E.A. Momburg F. Nijenhuis M. Bulbuc N. Fruh K. Hammerling G.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 43Koopmann J.O. Post M. Neefjes J.J. Hammerling G.J. Momburg F. Eur. J.

Immunity. 2000; 13: 117-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Although the peptide translocation efficiency generally varied between cell lines, VV infection did not affect TAP function. In human HeLa cells and monkey CV1 cells gpUS6 inhibited transport of peptide by more than 85% in comparison to WT VV-infected cells (Fig. 1). In rabbit Rab-9 cells peptide translocation was also sensitive to gpUS6. In contrast, in mouse and rat cells peptide translocation was not impaired by gpUS6. The same pattern of TAP sensitivity to gpUS6 was observed when a further peptide was used in the translocation assay (data not shown). The data suggest that gpUS6 inhibits TAP-mediated peptide translocation in a species-dependent manner and that rat and mouse TAP resist functional inactivation by gpUS6. gpUS6 Associates Only with Preformed TAP Heterodimers and Both TAP1 and TAP2 Provide Independent Binding Domains—Previous work has demonstrated that the luminal domain of gpUS6 physically interacts with the TAP-tapasin-MHC class I peptide loading complex (16Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K. Immunity. 1997; 6: 613-621Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Hewitt E.W.

Chem. 2001; 276: 48031-48039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but the molecular basis for this interaction is still unknown. To analyze gpUS6 binding to TAP subunits, we expressed human and rat TAP1 and TAP2 subunits (hT1 and hT2; rT1 and rT2) with rVV. TAP-deficient mouse CMT64.5 cells were infected with rVV expressing gpUS6 and different combinations of human and rat TAP subunits. Binding of gpUS6 to TAP was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation using anti-gpUS6 antibodies. Single expressed human TAP subunits did not bind to gpUS6 (Fig. 2, lanes 2 and 3). Only co-expression of human TAP1 with human TAP2 established co-precipitation of both TAP subunits (Fig. 2, lane 4). In contrast, co-expressed rat TAP subunits were not precipitated by anti-gpUS6 antibodies (Fig. 2, lane 6). However, combinations of one rat subunit with a human counterpart (hT1 with rT2 or rT1 with hT2) were sufficient to restore co-precipitation of the TAP heterodimer (Fig. 2, lanes 8 and 9). We conclude that both subunits of human TAP each contain independent recognition sites for gpUS6. gpUS6 binding to a single TAP chain is sufficient for precipitating the preformed heterodimeric TAP complex, the formation of which depends on TAP subunit assembly with a complementary TAP molecule. gpUS6 Binding to Both TAP Subunits Is Required for Efficient Inactivation of Peptide Transport—Next, we asked whether gpUS6 binding to a single TAP subunit is sufficient to inhibit peptide translocation. Peptide transport was assessed in TAP-deficient CMT64.5 cells stably transfected with US6 or an empty vector control after reconstitution of human and rat TAP subunits by rVV infection. As an index peptide, TNKTRIDGQY was chosen, which is efficiently transported by both human and rat TAP (43Koopmann J.O. Post M. Neefjes J.J. Hammerling G.J. Momburg F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1720-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This peptide was equally well transported by hT1/hT2 and hT1/rT2, and transport by rT1/rT2 was only slightly better than translocation by rT1/hT2 (supplemental Fig. 9). In this experimental setting, peptide translocation was inhibited by 60% in US6-transfected cells after reconstitution with human TAP1/2 when compared with nontransfected CMT64.5 cells (Fig. 3). As expected, peptide translocation by rat TAP was not inhibited in CMT64.5-US6 cells. Expression of combinations of human/rat transporter subunits, i.e. hT1/rT2 or rT1/hT2, allowed gpUS6 to block TAP transport to a rate of about half of what was determined for hT1/hT2 (Fig. 3). Thus, simultaneous gpUS6 binding to both TAP1 and TAP2 is a prerequisite for efficient functional inactivation of peptide translocation. The TAP1 C-terminal TMD Contains a Binding Site for gpUS6—To locate binding domains sufficient for gpUS6 interaction with TAP subunits, a set of intrachain human/rat TAP chimeras was constructed. Because the gpUS6 ectodomain is sufficient for TAP inhibition (16Ahn K. Gruhler A. Galocha B. Jones T.R. Wiertz E.J. Ploegh H.L. Peterson P.A. Yang Y. Fruh K.

Conserved regions in the human and rat nucleotide sequence were used for construction of the chimeras. TAP1 chimeras constructed and analyzed are depicted in Fig. 4A and Table 1. All TAP1 hybrids were able to translocate peptides in an ATP-dependent manner when combined with rat TAP2, albeit with different efficiencies (supplemental Fig. 9). To test the sensitivity to gpUS6 inhibition, the TAP1 chimeras were combined with either hTAP2 or rTAP2, and the efficiency of peptide translocation was assessed. The chimeras r6hT1 and r8hT1 behaved like hT1, i.e. when combined with hT2 gpUS6 blocked peptide translocation by 50–60% (Fig. 4B, white bars) and when combined with rTAP2 the gpUS6-mediated inhibition reached 25–30% (Fig. 4B, black bars). In contrast, the chimeras h6rT1 and h8rT1 showed a similar type of result as rTAP1. When combined with rTAP2, the gpUS6-mediated inhibition was not restored (Fig. 4B, black bars), whereas the combination with hTAP2 yielded an inhibition of about 20% (Fig. 4B, white bars).TABLE 1Interaction of gpUS6 with human/rat TAP 1 chimerasTAP1Human partsgpUS6SequenceTMSsLuminal loopsInhibitionBindinghT11-7481-101-5++rT1--h6rT11-3091-61-3--h8rT11-3761-81-4-+r6hT1310-7487-104-5++r8hT1377-7489-105++rxhT1539-748--r8hVRT1377-434;437-7489-105 (humT435V; humS436R)++ Open table in a new tab To determine whether the functional interference of gpUS6 with TAP1 chimeras translates into detectable binding, the TAP1 chimeras were co-expressed with rat or human TAP2 in CMT64.5-US6 cells and detected after co-immunoprecipitation with anti-gpUS6 antibodies in Western blot. As expected, TAP1 subunits were present in gpUS6 precipitates after co-expression with human TAP2 (data shown for h6rT1 and h8rT1, Fig. 4C, lanes 5 and 7). To define domains of TAP1 sufficient for gpUS6 binding, TAP1 chimeras were combined with the rat TAP2 subunit (Fig. 4C).

We determined a key population trait-survival-in the Bahamian lizard Anolis sagrei on islands with an experimentally introduced predatory lizard and on neighboring unmanipulated islands. On unmanipulated islands, survival declined with several variables, most notably vegetation height: The island with the shortest vegetation had nearly the highest survival recorded for any lizard. On islands with the introduced predator, which forages mostly on the ground, A. sagrei shifted to taller vegetation; unlike on unmanipulated islands, its survival was very low on islands with the shortest vegetation but was higher on the others. Thus, species introduction radically changed a resident species' relation of survival to a key island-biogeographical variable."
https://openalex.org/W2035807710,"A major role of the multifunctional human Ape1 protein is to incise at apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) sites in DNA via site-specific endonuclease activity.

Barsky D. Mutat. Res. 2001; 485: 283-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). This enzyme catalyzes incision of the phosphodiester backbone immediately 5′ to an AP lesion, initiating a cascade of events that involves components of the base excision repair (BER) pathway and aims to remove the abasic residue and re-establish genetic integrity (2.Fortini P. Pascucci B. Parlanti E. D'Errico M. Simonelli V. Dogliotti E. Biochimie (Paris). 2003; 85: 1053-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Abasic sites are common products in DNA, arising either spontaneously (at a rate of 10,000 events per mammalian genome per day), via accelerated base release because of chemical modification, or through enzyme (glycosylase)-catalyzed removal of a damaged base (3.Lindahl T. Nature. 1993; 362: 709-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (4378) Google Scholar, 4.Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2759Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). If unrepaired, AP lesions present mutagenic and cytotoxic challenges to the cell (5.Loeb L.A. Preston B.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 201-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Deficiencies in Ape1 activity in mice have been associated with increased spontaneous mutation frequencies in both somatic and germ line cells (6.Huamani J. McMahan C.A. Herbert D.C. Reddick R.

Devaraj S. Kisby G.E. Burns D.K. Daniel R.L. Hammer R.E. Grundy S. Jialal I. Friedberg E.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5552-5557PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that, although uncommon, human Ape1 protein variants with reduced function have been identified (8.Hadi M.Z. Coleman M.A. Fidelis K. Mohrenweiser H.W. Wilson III, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3871-3879Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). It is generally accepted that Ape1 is the predominant AP site incision enzyme in mammals, accounting for >95% (if not all) of the total cellular AP endonuclease activity (9.Demple B. Harrison L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 915-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). In fact, recent evidence argues that its AP endonuclease function is essential for cell viability (10.Fung H.

For many years, this activity had been characterized on double-stranded (ds) AP-DNA substrates (12.Barzilay G. Mol C.D. Robson C.N. Walker L.J. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. Hickson I.D. Nat. Struct.

Recently, however, it was shown that Ape1 exhibits a robust endonuclease activity at AP sites in single-stranded (ss) oligonucleotides, in some instances greater than in dsDNA, as well as in several complex and biologically relevant ss structures, such as primer-template duplexes, bubble conformations, and fork-like arrangements (15.Marenstein D.R.

Biol. 2005; 345 (and references therein): 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Presently, little is known about how these more “exotic” activities of Ape1 are modulated or how the resulting incision products are handled by the cell. Replication protein A (RPA) is the most abundant ssDNA-binding protein in mammalian cells, present at roughly 100,000 molecules per cell (17.Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). This heterotrimeric complex was originally identified as an essential component of simian virus (SV40) DNA replication in vitro (18.Wobbe C.R. Weissbach L. Borowiec J.A. Dean F.B. Murakami Y. Bullock P. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 1834-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 19.Wold M.S. Kelly T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

More recent studies have demonstrated that RPA operates in many processes of eukaryotic DNA metabolism, including repair and recombination (21.Thoma B.S. Vasquez K.M. Mol. Carcinog. 2003; 38: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 22.Iftode C. Daniely Y. Borowiec J.A. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 34: 141-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Its primary role is presumed to be in modulating or coordinating these various DNA transactions, via both its well characterized DNA binding activity and its assorted interactions with other proteins (17.Wold M.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 61-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). In this study, we aimed to identify the DNA structural elements that influence Ape1 ss AP site incision activity and to determine the effect of RPA on Ape1 ss and ds AP endonuclease functions. Our results herein reveal that Ape1 requires some form of DNA secondary conformation for proficient ss AP site incision, that the type and location of the secondary structure with respect to the AP lesion can have a significant impact on Ape1 efficiency, and that RPA is likely a key negative regulator of Ape1 ss cleavage activity in vivo. Proteins and Oligonucleotide Substrates—Recombinant human Ape1 protein was purified as described previously (23.Erzberger J.P. Barsky D. Scharer O.D. Colvin M.E. Wilson III, D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26 (and references therein): 2771-2778Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recombinant human RPA was purified as detailed by Henricksen et al. (24.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) strains were transformed with p11dtRPA, and the RPA complex was expressed at 37 °C for 3 h in the presence of 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Harvested bacteria were lysed by sonication, and the resulting soluble fraction was subjected to column chromatography on Affi-Gel Blue (Bio-Rad), hydroxylapatite (CHT-II from Bio-Rad), and Q-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) as described (24.Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by chromatography on an ssDNA cellulose column (Sigma) (25.Kenny M.K. Schlegel U. Furneaux H. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7693-7700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The eluate from ssDNA cellulose was concentrated via Amicon Ultra-15 (molecular weight cutoff of 10,000; Millipore Corp.) and analyzed (Fig. 5A). T7 endo I was purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies and are listed in Table 1. See Ref. 16.Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol.

For biochemical assays (see below), the oligonucleotides containing an AP site were radiolabeled at the 5′ end using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) as recommended by the manufacturer.TABLE 1Deoxyribose oligonucleotidesNameSequence (5′ to 3′)19 poly(A)-FAAAAAAAAAFAAAAAAAAA19 poly(T)-FTTTTTTTTTFTTTTTTTTT26 poly(T)-FTTTTTTTTTTTTTTFTTTTTTTTTTT34 poly(T)-FTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTFTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT26GFAAATTCACCGGTACGFACTAGAATTCG26F3′DAATGCACCGGTAGCFACTAGCATTCG26FDDAATGCACCGGTACGFACTAGCATTCG26FDD1AATGCACCGGTACGCAFCAGCATTCG26FDD2AATGCACCGGTACGGACFAGCATTCG26FDTTTTTACCGGTACGGACFAGCATTCG26FD2TTTACCGTGTATCGGACFAGCATTGC34FCTGCAGCTGATGCGCFGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC34F5′DCTGCAGCTGATGCGCFGTACTTATCCCCCGGTAG34FDDCTTTAGCTGATTTGCFGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAG34F5′D1CTGCAGCTGATGCGCTGFACTTATCCCCCGGTAG34F5′D2CTGCAGCTGATGCFCAGTACTTATCCCCCGGTAG34COMPCTGCAGCTGATGCGCCGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC34GGTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG42CompTGCTTAGGATCATCGAGGATCGAGCTCGGTGCAATTCAGCGG42F-forkGGCGACTTAACFTGGCTCGAGCATCCTCGATGATCCTAAGCA42F-11bubbleCCGCTGAATTGCACCCTCGAFCTAGGTCGATGATCCTAAGCA Open table in a new tab AP Site Incision Assays—Ape1 endonuclease activity was monitored essentially as described (16.Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345 (and references therein): 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In brief, unless otherwise indicated, Ape1 and 1 pmol of 32P-labeled F-containing ss or ds oligonucleotide substrates (10 μl final volume) were incubated at 37 °C under the previously defined, physiologically relevant reaction conditions (OPT buffer: 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2; 100 mm KCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 1 mm dithiothreitol; and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin). Protein amount and incubation time are indicated in the figure or associated legend. Where RPA was included, RPA was pre-mixed with the substrate on ice for 20 min prior to the addition of Ape1 and the initiation of the reaction at 37 °C. Following the addition of stop buffer and heat inactivation at 95 °C for 10 min, an aliquot of the completed reaction was separated on a 15% polyacrylamide urea denaturing gel. Intact radiolabeled substrate and incised product were visualized and quantified using a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and accompanying software. DNA Secondary Structure Prediction—Potential secondary structure for all oligonucleotides was determined using the RNAfold program at rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAfold.cgi. Structure predictions were run using DNA parameters and the default options. Native Gel Electrophoresis—ss oligonucleotides were 5′-radiolabeled as described above. DNAs were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in OPT buffer plus 10% glycerol (see above). Oligonucleotides (0.5 pmol) were immediately loaded on a 12% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide/bis) and electrophoresed at 160 V in 1× TBE for 2.5 h at room temperature. Gel images were obtained by standard PhosphorImager analysis. T7 Endo I Footprinting—One μl of 5′-radiolabeled oligonucleotide (1 pmol) was added to 18 μl of 1× New England Biolabs buffer 2 and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Reactions were then continued at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence of 1 μl of T7 endo I (i.e. 1–1.5 units of enzyme). DNA was subsequently precipitated by the addition of 0.5 ml of ethanol and 1 μl (20 μg) of glycogen, followed by centrifugation. The pelleted DNA was dried, resuspended in stop buffer, and heated at 95 °C for 5 min before electrophoresis on an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Images were obtained by standard PhosphorImager analysis. Standard and Competition EMSAs—A DNA competitor-based EMSA was employed to evaluate the relative affinities of Ape1 for specific ss F-containing oligonucleotides. In brief, 50 fmol of radiolabeled ds 34F:34G were incubated with 0.5 ng of Ape1 (14 fmol) for 20 min in OPT buffer without MgCl2 and plus 5% glycerol. Subsequently, 100× (5 pmol) of the indicated ss substrate was added (final volume of 10 μl), and the incubation was continued for another 20 min on ice. The reaction was subsequently resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel at 4 °C in 0.5× TBE. Electrophoresis was carried out for 80 min at 10 V/cm gel. Radiolabeled DNA was visualized and quantified using standard PhosphorImager analysis (see above). RPA DNA binding affinity was determined using a slightly modified EMSA. In brief, 20 fmol of labeled DNA substrate was incubated as above with the indicated amount of RPA. Where both RPA and Ape1 were included, Ape1 (60 fmol) was pre-mixed with the substrate for 20 min prior to the addition of RPA (see figure legend). Binding reactions were then analyzed as above. Dependence of Ape1 ss Incision Activity on DNA Secondary Structure— Ape1 has been shown to effectively incise at AP sites in ssDNA (15.Marenstein D.R. Wilson III, D.M. Teebor G.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), with its endonuclease efficiency seemingly influenced by the potential secondary structure of the oligonucleotide (16.Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345 (and references therein): 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine more explicitly the role of DNA secondary structure on Ape1 activity in vitro, incision assays were performed using DNAs unable to form secondary conformations, namely 19 poly(A)-F and 19 poly(T)-F (Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, A (time course) and B (protein titration), Ape1 was unable to efficiently incise these ss 19-mer AP site-containing oligonucleotides, although the enzyme was fully capable of cleaving the positive control ss 34F DNA (see below). To exclude the possibility that 19 poly(A)-F and 19 poly(T)-F were improperly synthesized, complementary DNAs (19T and 19A) were generated and annealed accordingly, and the resulting duplexes were examined for Ape1 incision. As shown in Fig. 1C, although the ss versions of poly(A)-F and poly(T)-F were not cleaved, the ds conformations were converted to product at a rate >100-fold more rapid. To examine the possibility that nucleotide (nt) length was a limiting factor in incision of the 19-mer ss F-DNAs, poly(T) oligonucleotides were created (i.e. 26 poly(T)-F and 34 poly(T)-F; see Table 1), which have identical length and harbor an abasic residue at the equivalent position as the previously studied 26GFA and 34F DNAs (16.Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345 (and references therein): 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Consistent with the 19 poly(A)-F and 19 poly(T)-F studies, no significant incision was observed with the 26- and 34-mer poly(T)-F oligonucleotides, whereas the ss 34F control was incised essentially completely (Fig. 1D). Our results argue that Ape1 requires some form of duplex arrangement to effectively bind and/or incise at the AP sites in ssDNA. Secondary Structure Analysis of the ss Oligonucleotide Substrates— The ss AP site-containing oligonucleotides, 26GFA and 34F (Table 1), were shown previously to be cleaved at an efficiency ∼20-fold less and ∼5-fold higher than comparable ds AP-DNA substrates, respectively, revealing an ∼100-fold difference in Ape1 ss AP-DNA incision rates (16.Wilson III, D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 345 (and references therein): 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It was presumed based on secondary structure predictions that the overall conformation of the ss oligonucleotide and the precise position of the AP site dictated Ape1 cleavage efficiency. In an attempt to identify the DNA structural elements that influence Ape1 ss AP site incision effectiveness, we designed related (i.e. sequence-modified) oligonucleotides that had the potential to form alternative secondary conformations, and then we tested Ape1 cleavage activity (see below). The various 26- and 34-mer F-containing oligonucleotides (Table 1) were chosen based largely on secondary structure predictions using the RNAfold algorithm. This computational program computes the optimal minimum free energy structure, employing experimental parameters measured at 37 °C (26.Hofacker I.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3429-3431Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A (top), 34F5′D and 34FDD were created to evaluate the contribution of either the 3′ or 5′ duplex structure seen in 34F flanking the AP site. 34F5′D, 34F5′D1, and 34F5′D2 were synthesized to determine the effect of the location of the AP site with respect to the hairpin loop (i.e. 3, 5, or 1 nt(s) from, respectively). 26FDD, 26FDD1, and 26FDD2 were created to assess the role of duplexes on either side of the AP site (as seen in 34F), as well as the location of the AP damage and the size of the bubble conformation (Fig. 2A, bottom). With 26FD and 26FD2, a more stable 5′ duplex stem was introduced (i.e. 3 bp as seen in 34F), and the size of the unpaired loop was modified, from 3 nt in 26FD to 5 nt in 26FD2. 26F3′D is distinct from 26GFA in that the AP site is placed more toward the center of the ss loop, and the position of the duplex has changed relative to the lesion. To determine the accuracy of these computational predictions (Fig. 2A), we first utilized native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to test for the existence of secondary structure. We reasoned that any ds arrangement would alter the mobility of the F-containing oligonucleotides with respect to the poly(T)-F counterpart, which should retain normal linear ss form. Such studies revealed that each of the 34-mer DNAs migrated more quickly than 34 poly(T)-F, indicating that ss 34F, 34F5′D, 34FDD, 34F5′D1, and 34F5′D2 consist of compact, intramolecular DNA secondary structure that promotes a more rapid mobility (Fig. 2B, left). In addition, each 34-mer exists as a single predominant detectable DNA species, without the existence of significant alternative DNA conformations. Similar results were obtained with the 26-mer AP-DNAs, with the ss oligonucleotides migrating more rapidly than 26 poly(T)-F and, in some instances, 19 poly(T)-F (Fig. 2B, right). Unlike the 34-mers, however, three of the 26-mers, 26F3′D, 26FDD, and 26FDD2, appeared to exist in alternative, secondary configurations that roughly comprised 23, 16, and 9% of the total DNA species, respectively. Most interestingly, the 26-mers that migrated most swiftly (i.e. 26F3′D, 26FDD, 26FDD1, and 26FDD2; Fig. 2B, right) were those predicted to possess the most compact (i.e. duplex) structure (Fig. 2A, bottom). Although it is evident that each of the 26- and 34-mer AP site-containing oligonucleotides exist in a complex secondary form that is distinct from comparable linear ssDNA (and in some cases is unique from its sequence-altered counterparts; Fig. 2B), to gain a more precise picture of the intramolecular nature of the various substrates, we employed chemical and nuclease footprinting assays. Unfortunately, studies with either dimethyl sulfate (DMS) or diethyl pyrocarbonate, which did react with the DNA bases of the 34-mers as expected, did not uncover any obvious secondary conformation, which we hypothesized would reduce target base (namely guanine) reactivity. This result likely indicates that the short stretches of dsDNA present in the ss 34-mer oligonucleotides do not prevent DMS (supplemental Fig. 1) or diethyl pyrocarbonate (data not shown) modification. Thus, as an alternative means of probing for secondary conformations, we employed T7 endonuclease I (T7 endo I), a structure-selective enzyme that recognizes and cleaves nonperfectly matched DNA, cruciform DNA, and Holliday structures or junctions (27.Parkinson M.J. Lilley D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 270: 169-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 28.Declais A.C. Fogg J.M. Freeman A.D. Coste F. Hadden J.M. Phillips S.E. Lilley D.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1398-1409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although recognizing that the substrate specificity of T7 endo I has not been thoroughly defined on ss oligonucleotides, our footprinting analyses generally support the existence of secondary structure as predicted for the 34- and 26-mer DNAs (Fig. 2A). In particular, in the case of 34F, the predominant nuclease band (24 nt in length) corresponds to a cutting site within the predicted unpaired 3′ loop, whereas the less prominent, yet significant, 13-nt band corresponds to incision immediately adjacent to the predicted 5′ stem-loop (Fig. 2C, left). Moreover, the major products of 13 and 24 nt seen with 34F5′D and 34FDD, respectively, are compatible with the above predicted 5′ and 3′ stem-loop structures. The 13-nt cleavage product observed with 34F5′D2 is also consistent with the theorized 5′ stem-loop, although the observation of additional bands implies the existence of alternative DNA secondary structures not predicted (e.g. a potential stem-loop between T18–A19 and T22–A23; denoted by dots in Fig. 2A), or an effect of the AP site location. A minor band of ∼24 nt is observed with 34F5′D and may reflect the presence of this 2-bp stem-loop as well, which again was not predicted by the RNAfold program. In the case of 34F5′D1, the major bands of 14, 16, 17, and 18 nt could be explained by T7 endo I incision at sites 3′ to the predicted stem-loop structure that may be influenced by the position of the AP site. With respect to the 26-mers, the existence of the large ds region predicted for 26F3′D, 26FDD, 26FDD1, and 26FDD2 is supported by the generation of the prominent 5- and 6-nt products (Fig. 2C, right), which correspond to T7 endo I incision immediately 3′ to the stem base (Fig. 2A). More importantly, the overall digestion patterns of 26F3′D, 26FDD and 26FDD1 are comparable, consistent with their similar mobility as seen in Fig. 2B (right). The predicted stem-loop structures of 26FD and 26FD2 are supported by the production of the 14–16-nt fragments, which are generated by cutting near the base of the evidently more stable 3-nt stem-loop structure. Significantly, the predicted structure of 26GFA was not confirmed by our footprinting studies, likely indicative of the weak stability of the predicted stem-loop structure, which consists of a short stem (2 nt) and a small loop (3 nt). Our native gel electrophoresis experiments indicate the presence of secondary structure in each of the 26- and 34-nt F-containing oligonucleotides. The T7 endo I footprinting studies support that the proposed, favored conformations are by and large the predominant DNA species. We emphasize that to our knowledge routine methodologies to interrogate secondary structures of ssDNA oligonucleotides are not well established. Effect of Secondary Structure on Ape1 Incision and Binding Activities— With the above structural information in hand, we next evaluated the efficiency with which Ape1 cleaved the various ss F-containing oligonucleotides. As shown in Fig. 3A (time course reactions) and quantitatively reported in Table 2 (specific activities), 34F5′D was cleaved at an efficiency similar to 34F (<1.1-fold difference), whereas Ape1 incision of 34FDD was significantly slower (∼7-fold reduced). Moreover, 34F5′D2 was converted to product at a rate ∼50-fold slower than 34F5′D1 (which was incised at a rate similar to 34F; Table 2). The steady-state kinetic curves shown in Fig. 3A are consistent with the presence of a single major DNA species for each oligonucleotide substrate, as seen in the native gel electrophoresis studies (Fig. 2B). Time course experiments with the 26-mer substrates indicate that each of the sequence-modified DNAs were cleaved by Ape1 (i) more efficiently than the parental 26GFA oligonucleotide (Table 2) and (ii) primarily via near-linear kinetics (Fig. 3B). Notably, 26FD2, which most closely mimics the 5′ portion of 34F (Fig. 2A), was found to be the best substrate (among the 26-mers) for Ape1, with an ∼8-fold improvement over 26GFA. Nonetheless, for reasons that are not clear (but may reflect the precise nt composition), all 26-mers were significantly poorer substrates (i.e. cleaved at a rate around 300-fold slower) in comparison to 34F, although 26FD2 was cleaved at an efficiency nearly identical to 34F5′D2 (summarized in Table 2).TABLE 2Specific incision activity of Ape1 and relative percent ds 34F bound by Ape1 in the presence of various ss substratesSubstratesSpecific incision activityRelative percent ds 34F bound to Ape1 in the presence of ss competitor DNAaThe numbers are relative to the absence of ss DNA and are graphed in Fig. 3D.pmol min-1 μg-1%34F3836 ± 9195.9 ± 8.834F5′D3612 ± 11485.1 ± 6.134FDD568 ± 12537 ± 1234F5′D14793 ± 35557 ± 1034F5′D2100 ± 1536 ± 1126GFA4.7 ± 1.269 ± 2026F3′D12 ± 2.9106 ± 2026FDD13 ± 3.9110 ± 2326FDD15.5 ± 1.7106 ± 1126FDD211 ± 2.898 ± 1226FD16 ± 2.5103 ± 1826FD237 ± 4.6101 ± 27a The numbers are relative to the absence of ss DNA and are graphed in Fig. 3D. Open table in a new tab The incision experiments in total suggest the following. (i) A 5′ duplex structure (with respect to the abasic site) is more favorable than a 3′ duplex, and ds structure on both sides is not essential for Ape1 cleavage (see 34F5′D versus 34FDD and see Ref. 13.Wilson III, D.M. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Demple B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (and references therein): 16002-16007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). (ii) A larger ss loop (i.e. 5 nt in 26FD2) is more favorable than a shorter loop (3 nt in 26FD), implying that the neighboring 5′-duplex stability, which is likely adversely affected by the torsional strain created by a short ss region in the hairpin loop, is an important element in determining Ape1 effectiveness (see also the results with 26GFA and 34F). (iii) an AP site immediately adjacent to a 5′ duplex structure is a deterrent to Ape1 cleavage, as compared with an abasic lesion positioned 3 or 5 nt from the secondary conformation (compare for instance 34F5′D2 with 34F5′D and 34F5′D1), although such conclusions are tentative because the T7 endo I footprinting studies do not fully support the predicted secondary configurations for 34F5′D and 34F5′D2. As a means of determining qualitatively whether the observed differences in Ape1 incision efficiency for the varying ss AP-DNAs (Table 2) were mainly the product of reduced substrate affinity, we employed a competitor-based EMSA. In these experiments, radiolabeled ds 34F: 34G DNA (Table 1) was incubated with Ape1, and a 100-fold molar"
https://openalex.org/W2145609957,"UVB exposure of epidermal cells is known to trigger early and late molecular pathways dependent on receptor tyrosine kinases and reactive oxygen species (ROS). We have recently reported that UVB irradiation induces tyrosine phosphorylation, kinase activation, and internalization of the receptor for the keratinocyte growth factor (KGFR), a paracrine mediator of epithelial growth, differentiation, and survival. Here we analyzed in more detail the UVB-induced endocytic pathway of KGFR and the role of KGFR activation and internalization in regulating UVB-promoted apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Immunogold electron microscopy and confocal analysis revealed that the UVB-induced endocytosis of KGFR occurs through clathrin-coated pits and that the internalized receptors are sorted to the degradative route and reach the lysosomal compartment with a timing similar to that induced by their ligand KGF. Treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine inhibited KGFR endocytosis, suggesting that the receptor internalization is mediated by the intracellular production of ROS. The ligand-independent KGFR endocytic pathway induced by UVB requires receptor kinase activity and tyrosine phosphorylation and involves transient receptor ubiquitination. Inhibition of KGFR activity reduces both the KGF-mediated proliferative response and the UVB-promoted apoptotic cell death, indicating a different effect of ligand-induced and UVB-induced KGFR triggering. In addition, receptor internalization leads to protection from apoptosis caused by UVB exposure. Finally, we compared directly the behavior of KGFR with that of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) upon UVB exposure. Surprisingly, biochemical and immunofluorescence analysis showed that EGFR, differently from KGFR, does not undergo UVB-induced tyrosine phosphorylation and internalization. Taken together, our results suggest a differential role of KGFR and EGFR in the response of epidermal cells to UVB possibly because KGFR endocytosis could be crucial for attenuation of survival signals in the suprabasal layers of human skin."
https://openalex.org/W2065707256,"Microarray-based gene expression analysis demonstrated that laser photocoagulation (LPC) of mouse eyes had a long-term effect on the expression of genes functionally related to tissue repair, cell migration, proliferation, ion, protein and nucleic acid metabolism, cell signaling, and angiogenesis. Six structural genes, including five crystallins (Cryaa, Cryba1, Crybb2, Crygc, Crygs) and keratin 1-12 (Krt1-12), the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin 1 (Tsp1), the retina- and brain-specific putative transcription factor tubby-like protein 1 (Tulp1), and transketolase (Tkt), a key enzyme in the pentose-phosphate pathway, were all shown to be up-regulated by real-time PCR and/or Western blotting. Immunohistochemistry localized five of these proteins to the laser lesions and surrounding tissue within the retina and pigmented epithelium. This is the first study demonstrating long-term changes in the expression of these genes associated with LPC. Therefore, it suggests that modulated gene expression might contribute to the long-term inhibitory effect of LPC. In addition, these genes present novel targets for gene-based therapies aimed at treating microangiopathies, especially diabetic retinopathy, a disease currently only treatable with LPC."
https://openalex.org/W2006378398,"The observations that three major cleavages within the transmembrane domain of APP, namely, the gamma-cleavage, -cleavage, and the newly identified zeta-cleavage, are involved in the generation of secreted Abeta40 and Abeta42 prompted us to determine how the calpain inhibitor III MDL 28170 influences these three cleavages and Abeta formation. With the use of a cell culture system, our data demonstrate that 1) at either high concentrations, or at a low range of concentrations, at early time points, MDL 28170 inhibits the formation of secreted Abeta40 and Abeta42. However, this effect is due to inhibition of the intermediate Abeta46 generation by zeta-cleavage and not due to direct inhibition of the gamma-cleavage that produces Abeta40/42 from Abeta46; 2) at low range of concentrations and at late time points, MDL 28170 causes an increase in secreted Abeta40/42 that likely results from inhibition of degradation of both the initial substrate, CTFbeta, and the final product, Abeta40/42, of gamma-secretase. These data strongly suggest that formation of Abeta46 is a key step in the gamma-secretase mediated generation of Abeta40/42 and provide a new target for the development of Abeta inhibitors. These data also suggest that calpain and related proteases, which are sensitive to MDL 28170, play an important role in the accumulation of secreted Abeta."
https://openalex.org/W2038308811,"Nuclear cytoplasmic O-GlcNAcase and acetyltransferase (NCOAT) is a bifunctional enzyme with both glycoside hydrolase and alkyltransferase activity.

ATs are catalogued into several subfamilies based on sequence, substrate specificity, and the context of other conserved protein domains (1.Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Members of the Gcn5, GNAT, and Hat1 families share a conserved mechanism of catalysis (1.Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). This mechanism involves an active site carboxylate-containing residue that abstracts a proton from the ϵ-amino group of the target lysine, causing its direct attack on acetyl-CoA. The acetyl group is transferred from the thioester of acetyl-CoA to the lysine side chain and an active site acid donates a proton to the sulfur atom of coenzyme A to bring the reaction to completion (2.Wolf E.

Marmorstein R. Denu J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18157-18160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Such a mechanism requires the formation of an enzyme-substrate-acetyl-CoA ternary complex before any events occur, thereby requiring the enzyme to have distinct substrate and acetyl-CoA binding sites.Members of the MYST family of ATs, which are believed to undergo a variation of this mechanism involving a self-acetylated intermediate (4.Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), also require distinct acetyl-CoA and substrate binding sites. MYST family members, with the exception of Esa1, share a CX2CX12HX3C zinc finger motif in the N-terminal portion of the active site that is responsible for making contacts with the histone tail substrates (5.Akhtar A. Becker P.B. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 6.Pelletier N. Champagne N. Lim H. Yang X.J.

Esa1 lacks a complete zinc-coordinating tetrahedral motif and therefore does not bind zinc, yet the crystal structure reveals that a zinc finger-like structure is present within this site (4.Yan Y. Barlev N.A. Haley R.H. Berger S.L. Marmorstein R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1195-1205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The histone acetyltransferases p300 and CBP also possess a zinc finger motif, a PHD-type finger, in a comparable region in the N termini of their HAT domains, which has been shown to be important in the binding of nucleosomes (8.Ragvin A. Valvatne H. Erdal S. Arskog V. Tufteland K.R. Breen K. Øyan A.M. Eberharter A. Gibson T.J. Becker P.B. Aasland R. J. Mol.

Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The HAT active site resides in the C terminus of the enzyme, and is structurally related, with four sequence motifs A–D in the catalytic core, to other ATs across many subfamilies (1.Marmorstein R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). NCOAT carries out its acetyltransfer by the same mechanism as that described for the GNAT, Gcn5, and Hat1 families and here we demonstrate that NCOAT displays biochemical properties consistent with its possession of a zinc finger-like domain as seen in the MYST family of HATs. Like MYST family member Esa1, NCOAT lacks a proper complete set of tetrahedral zinc-coordinating residues and does not bind zinc. NCOAT can directly bind histone H4 in vitro, both free and in the context of oligonucleosome substrates, and this binding ability is abrogated upon H4 acetylation on lysine 8. Select point mutations to this finger domain disrupt both its histone binding ability as well as its HAT activity. Furthermore, a construct containing this motif as well as 40 amino acids surrounding it on each side is sufficient to confer histone H4 binding ability to an otherwise non-histone-binding protein. This study characterizes the histone interacting domain of NCOAT, and these features of the HAT domain can collectively help better define its mode of action and its family relationships.MATERIALS AND METHODSRecombinant NCOAT and Mutagenesis—A pUC118-pTM hybrid expression vector was designed as described previously for expression of GST alone or as an N-terminal fusion protein with mouse NCOAT or the NCOAT HAT domain (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For point mutations, the pUC-pTM-NCOAT was modified by site-directed mutagenesis using a four-primer cassette strategy to introduce the substitution (mutated residues underlined) and a selection site (bold). PCR amplifications were performed with the following oligonucleotides (5′-3′): D774A, GAAGATGAAGCCGGCATTTGTGGTTATGCC; C777A, GAAGATGAAGATGGCATTGCCGGCTATGCC; F789A, GTAGACGTCACCCCCGCCATTAAAAAGTGT; C793A, GTAGACGTCACCCCCTTCATTAAAAAGGCCAAAATT; S796A, TGTAAAATTGCCTGGATTCCC. Flanking oligonucleotides were: upstream, GGGTGTCGTAGTCACTCTTCAGCACAGTTC and downstream, GGCTTGGTATACTTCTCTTGCATGAAGGGG. Products were separated by electrophoresis, extracted, and purified by the QIAquick extraction kit (Qiagen). Products were digested with Bsu36I and MfeI and ligated into pUC-pTM-NCOAT digested with the same. Ligations were transformed into DH5α cells (Invitrogen), screened for the selection sites, and sequenced. For the GST finger construct, the pUC-pTM-NCOAT plasmid was digested with MfeI and SacI. The 357-bp fragment was ligated into pTM digested with EcoRI and SacI. DNA manipulations were performed by standard procedures (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Purification—BSC40 cells (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 0.2 mg of penicillin, and 2 mg of gentamicin according to standard procedures. 20 μg of plasmid were transfected by electroporation, incubated overnight, then infected with VTF-7 vaccinia virus for 12 h. Transfected cells, or untransfected cells for whole cell lysates were harvested in 0.5% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl, 20% glycerol (v/w), 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), pH 8.0. GST or GST fusion proteins were purified from lysates using glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences), and stringently washed with RIPA buffer. Protein concentration was quantitated by the Bio-Rad assay and equal amounts were used in all assays. Purity was verified by Coomassie stain of samples run on 8% SDS-PAGE. To locate free cysteines, N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (HPDP-Biotin) (Pierce) was prepared as a 4 mm solution in Me2SO from a 50 mm stock in N,N-dimethylformamide. Purified wild type NCOAT was eluted in 50 μl of glutathione elution buffer (30 mm reduced glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm DTT) and 50 μl of HPDP-Biotin was added. Reactions were incubated in the dark at room temperature for 1 h. Samples were then digested with 2 μl (2 units) of trypsin (Roche) in 25 mm sodium bicarbonate overnight at 37 °C. Biotinylated fragments were passed over a 100-μl streptavidin column (Pierce) for 1 h at 4°Cin avidin binding buffer (20 mm phosphate-buffered saline, 500 mm NaCl). Bound peptides were washed, then eluted with 50 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature. The eluant was analyzed by MALDI-MS with the collected peptides subsequently analyzed by LC-MS-MS to verify sequence. Free cysteine identification on C793A was carried out with 5 μg of Glu-C protease (New England BioLabs), in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm Glu-Glu, overnight at room temperature.Finger Domain Sequence Alignments—MYST family member sequences have been reported elsewhere (7.Takechi S. Nakayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Mammalian NCOAT sequences examined, with their accession numbers, are as follows: human, NP_036347; mouse, NP_076288; rat, AAK72103; dog, XP_534996; and chimpanzee, XP_507995.HAT Assays and Zinc Detection—Liquid scintillation and oligonucleosome HAT assays were performed as described previously (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 1,10-phenanthroline (Sigma) dissolved in ethanol was added to recombinant p300 HAT domain (Upstate) or purified NCOAT at final concentrations of 5 or 10 mm for 30 min at 4 °C. Solutions were diluted into HAT buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm sodium butyrate). Final reaction volumes (400 μl) were twice that of other liquid scintillation assays (220 μl). We noted no difference in activity using the same amount of enzyme, substrate, and acetyl-CoA despite the doubling of reaction volume. Prior to some assays, resin-bound GST-tagged NCOAT HAT domain was incubated with 10, 20, 30, 40, or 50 mm DTT dissolved in water for 30 min at room temperature. Samples were washed, then HAT assays were carried out in HAT buffer supplemented with the indicated DTT concentration. 10 μl (10 μg) of p300 HAT domain were also incubated with the final indicated DTT concentrations in 50-μl volumes. After 30 min at room temperature, the remaining HAT assay components, with DTT, were added so that the final volume (220 μl) was equal for both the p300 and NCOAT HAT reactions.Histone Binding Assays—Binding assays performed with a synthetic biotinylated H4 tail substrate (Upstate) were achieved by incubating 2 μg of H4 tail with 50 μl of streptavidin beads (Pierce) at 4 °C for 1 h in avidin binding buffer. Resin was washed three times with RIPA buffer, then purified and eluted GST-tagged NCOAT protein was added for 1 h at 4 °C in HAT buffer. Washes were repeated, and resin-bound material was run on 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blot with anti-GST according to standard protocols. Where indicated, 1, 2, 3, or 4 μg of free H4 tail peptide (Upstate) were added into the reaction mixture to test competition. Oligonucleosomes were reconstituted as described elsewhere (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For nucleosome retention assays, 20 μg of reconstituted nucleosomes were incubated with the indicated purified, immobilized protein in 500 μl of HAT buffer for 1 h at room temperature, with 500 μg of bovine serum albumin to prevent nonspecific binding. Free peptide competition assays were performed by adding 10, 20, 30, or 40 μgof free H4 tail to the reconstitiuted nucleosome/NCOAT mixture. In some assays, 10 μg of acetyl-CoA was added to the mixture to determine binding on acetylated substrates, and where indicated, 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.4, was added to 10 μg of acetyl-CoA for 30 min at 37 °C, to remove the acetyl-CoA acetate groups. Washed samples were then resolved on 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-histone H4, or unacetylated H4, acetylated H4, or H4 only acetylated on lysine 8, (Upstate). Where indicated, immobilized wild type or Y891F mutant enzymes were incubated with 500 μl of BSC40 whole cell lysate for 1 h at 4 °C, then washed. In some assays, 1 m hydroxylamine, pH 7.4, was added to the whole cell lysate for 30 min or 1 h prior to incubation with GST-NCOAT. In other binding assays, the indicated DTT concentration was incubated, as described above, with the GST-NCOAT HAT domain or GST finger construct. Tail-less nucleosomes were prepared as described by Ragvin et al. (8.Ragvin A. Valvatne H. Erdal S. Arskog V. Tufteland K.R. Breen K. Øyan A.M. Eberharter A. Gibson T.J. Becker P.B. Aasland R. J.

Given its high degree of similarity to other HATs, which have the ability to directly bind histones in addition to their HAT activity, we wished to determine whether NCOAT could stably interact with histones as well. To examine direct NCOAT-histone interaction, we utilized a biotin-tagged histone H4 tail substrate, containing the N-terminal 24 amino acids of histone H4. Whereas NCOAT can acetylate all four core histones in vitro, we chose H4 for our binding experiments because much of our previous characterization of NCOAT HAT activity was done using this histone. The biotin tag allows for the fixation of this substrate to streptavidin-conjugated agarose. The resin-bound H4 tail was then incubated with purified, eluted GST-NCOAT in HAT assay buffer. After stringent washing, the resin mixture was run on 8% SDS-PAGE and NCOAT-histone binding was examined by Western blot with anti-GST. As shown in Fig. 1A, the N-terminal 24 amino acids of histone H4 can be used successfully to affinity purify mammalian-expressed NCOAT in this in vitro system (first lane), and this binding could be abated by the addition of free H4 tail peptide in a dose-dependent manner (second to fifth lanes). The H4 tail was unable to co-precipitate GST-NCOAT from whole cell lysates for reasons that will be described below. Incubations with GST alone did not result in the co-purification of GST by the H4 tail, indicating that the GST tag was not responsible for the observed histone binding by NCOAT. Lastly, the observed binding was not the result of NCOAT being tethered to avidin beads, as reactions carried out in the absence of biotin-H4 peptide could not be used to effectively purify NCOAT (Fig. 1A, sixth lane).With NCOAT appearing to have an affinity for binding a synthetic histone tail substrate, we wished to examine if NCOAT would bind histone H4 under more biologically relevant conditions. Oligonucleosomes were reconstituted using histone octamers and α-satellite DNA purified from HeLa cells by PCR. The oligonucleosome arrays were incubated with purified resin-bound GST-NCOAT in the HAT activity buffer. Following incubation and washing, the material still bound to GST-NCOAT was run on 15% SDS-PAGE and the presence of unacetylated H4 was probed by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1B, the NCOAT protein could effectively co-precipitate histone H4 in these oligonucleosome retention assays, and competition for this binding could be achieved with free H4 tail peptide. Again, the glutathione resin could not be used to purify H4 (sixth lane) and, likewise, resin-bound GST alone was unable to do so (seventh lane).NCOAT has been demonstrated to acetylate lysine 8 of histone H4 (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We placed GST-NCOAT in the same oligonucleosome retention assays in the presence of acetyl-CoA and repeated the procedure with a Western blot for H4 acetylated on Lys8. Whereas analysis of the supernatant shows that NCOAT effectively acetylates H4 on Lys8 (Fig. 1C, first lane), the enzyme no longer has the ability to co-precipitate the H4 that had been acetylated on Lys8 (Fig. 1C, second lane). However, again, the minor fraction of histone H4 that was left unmodified by NCOAT even when acetyl-CoA was added to the reaction mixture (Fig. 1D, second lane), could still be purified by GST-NCOAT (Fig. 1D, third lane). GST-NCOAT could not be co-purified by the H4 tail in the presence of acetyl-CoA either (Fig. 1E), suggesting that acetylation upon other histones within nucleosomes are not wholly responsible for the lack of NCOAT binding to H4 when acetylated on Lys8. When GST-NCOAT was used in attempts to co-precipitate unacetylated H4 from cell lysates, unacetylated H4 could not be detected (Fig. 2A). Because acetyl-CoA is present in whole cell lysate preparations, and this enzyme is catalytically active, unacetylated histone that binds to these proteins would be subject to the activity of the enzyme. After the catalysis of acetyltransfer, just as seen in Fig. 1, C and E, the enzyme releases the substrate. Therefore, the inability of these enzymes to co-purify unacetylated histone H4 from a whole cell lysate is unsurprising. An enzyme that is catalytically inactive, however, an NCOAT with a Tyr891 → Phe mutation (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was able to co-purify histone-unacetylated H4 from a whole cell lysate (Fig. 2A). This protein contains the necessary histone binding domain, and can therefore bind H4, but cannot catalyze the reaction that results in substrate release. Another way to show binding in this acetyl-CoA inclusive system would be to add the thioester-cleaving reagent, hydroxylamine, to the whole cell lysate reaction mixture to deplete the acetyl-CoA pool. To test this principle, 1 m hydroxylamine was able to significantly prevent H4 binding to GST-bound NCOAT when added with acetyl-CoA 30 min prior to the nucleosome retention assay (Fig. 2B, left). Hydroxylamine cleavage of acetyl-CoA to CoA is verifiable by measuring the absorbance of the resultant hydroxamic acid at 520 nm (data not shown). When added to a whole cell lysate, 1 m hydroxylamine effectively depletes the acetyl-CoA pool in a time-dependent manner (1 h, rather than 30 min), and this then allows the wild type NCOAT to bind unacetylated H4 in a whole cell lysate (Fig. 2B, right). These data support the idea that NCOAT does have an ability to bind histone H4 in a natural cellular environment.FIGURE 2NCOAT directly binds the histone H4 tail and does not require acetyl-lysine contacts. A, a catalytically inactive mutant (Y891F), but not the wild type (WT), can purify unacetylated histone H4 from whole cell lysates (WCL). B, the H4 fraction that is co-purified by Y891F contains acetylated histone. C, addition of hydroxylamine to nucleosome retention assays in the presence of acetyl-CoA (left) or to a whole cell lysate (right) allows NCOAT to co-precipitate unacetylated H4. D, removal of the histone tails by trypsin abolishes the ability of NCOAT to retain unacetylated H4 in retention assays. E, the trypsin protocol above does not result in the digestion of the whole histone proteins, as seen by Coomassie Blue staining. F, trypsinization also leaves the oligonucleosomes intact for the binding assays, as seen by the gel shift assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We next addressed whether NCOAT could bind H4 that may be acetylated at sites other than lysine 8. To test this possibility, the Y891F mutant reaction was repeated, and the co-precipitate was probed for acetylated histone H4. As shown in Fig. 2C, the histone sample co-purified by Y891F NCOAT still contained a generous fraction of acetylated histone H4. Just as in Fig. 1C, we have not investigated which of the four alternative lysines on the H4 tail are acetylated within this sample, but the result is sufficient to suggest that NCOAT can bind both unacetylated and acetylated H4, although it appears that acetylation on at least lysine 8 eradicates the binding ability of the enzyme. Not surprisingly, because NCOAT can bind unacetylated H4, acetylation at these other sites are not required for recognition and binding by NCOAT. The addition of an acetyl-lysine analog, Nω-acetylhistamine, prior to the reaction could not compete for NCOAT binding in any of our assays, nor could it impair HAT activity (data not shown), revealing that prior acetylations on H4 are not a requirement for our observed interaction.Finally, H4 detection by Western blot in these nucleosome retention assays is not a result of H4 being indirectly co-purified by NCOAT-DNA interaction. When reconstituted nucleosomes were treated briefly with trypsin to remove the histone tails, H4 could no longer be detected in these assays (Fig. 2D), demonstrating the necessity of the histone tails, but not the DNA, for NCOAT-histone interaction. Trypsin treatment did not result in the digestion of the entire histone proteins, which are still visible by Coomassie stain (Fig. 2E) and the protein-DNA nucleosomal arrays remain intact as well, as seen by DNA gel shift assay (Fig. 2F). These data indicate that NCOAT has the ability to bind histone H4 in the context of nucleosomes, but after acetylation, at least on Lys8, this ability is eliminated. Presumably, the need of the enzyme to bind the substrate is no longer necessary after the enzyme has catalyzed its reaction to completion. Whereas H4 may be co-purified from oligonucleosomes via an indirect interaction with another histone, the direct H4 tail binding and elimination of binding after acetylation on lysine 8 argue for the direct binding of NCOAT to H4.NCOAT Contains a Motif Similar to the Histone Binding Domain in the MYST Family of HATs—Members of the MYST family of histone acetyltransferases have been elucidated to contain a CX2CX12HX3C zinc finger domain in the N terminus of their active sites, overlapping the first α helix (helix C) in the conserved active site globular core. Biochemical characterization of these motifs implicates them in a role in the mediation of contact with the histone tails during nucleosome recognition and thus they are also essential for HAT activity (5.Akhtar A. Becker P.B. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7.Takechi S. Nakayama T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). MYST family member Esa1 is an exception, and does not possess a zinc finger, although the region does form a classic zinc finger-like fold as determined by crystal structure (12.Schwabe J.W. Klug A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Whereas aspartates can occasionally be utilized as zinc coordinating residues (13.Simpson R.J. Cram E.D. Czolij R. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28011-28018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), Esa1 contains a DX2TX12YX3C motif at this site and lacks at least two zinc-coordinating residues, and does not bind zinc. All mammalian NCOATs we examined possess a DX2CX11FX3C motif in this exact region as seen in the primary sequence and a large number of secondary structure prediction programs (11.Toleman C. Paterson A.J. Whisenhunt T.R. Kudlow J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 53665-53673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14.Schultz J. Pils B. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 179-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). This motif contains an additional cysteine residue, like those in standard zinc fingers, and has a conservative replacement of a tyrosine to a phenylalanine when compared with the sequence of Esa1 at the comparable position. This led us to postulate that NCOAT may possess a zinc finger-like motif similar to that of Esa1. This region of mammalian NCOAT also has resemblance to Ca2+-binding epidermal growth factor-like domains as identified by SMART analysis (15.Schultz J. Milpetz F. Bork P. Ponting C.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5857-5864Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar), giving further substantiation that this may be a domain similar to those that bind divalent cations. Interestingly, other HATs such as CBP and p300 also possess a PHD-type zinc finger in a comparable region of their AT domain and these have also been implicated in histone substrate interactions (8.Ragvin A. Valvatne H. Erdal S. Arskog V. Tufteland K.R. Breen K. Øyan A.M. Eberharter A. Gibson T.J. Becker P.B. Aasland R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 773-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).FIGURE 3NCOAT possesses a potential zinc finger-like domain. A, alignment of NCOAT sequences and MYST family members. Compared with the same region of the first α helix of the MYST family HAT domain, a sequence in the NCOAT HAT domain has distinct similarity to the zinc finger domain in these HATs. B, addition of up to 15 mm 1,10-phenanthroline does not significantly inhibit NCOAT HAT activity. C, the wild type (WT) enzyme contains two free cysteines at amino acids 166 and 878, as seen after tryptic digest and purification of free thiol-containing peptides. D, when Cys793 is mutated, three free cysteine-containing peaks can be purified from a Glu-C-digested protein. Two of these correspond to peptides visualized after digestion of the wild type.

https://openalex.org/W1494532426,"In the 1990s, the model of Earth's mantle as two separately convecting layers was challenged by seismic measurements. Despite this, several arguments survive that support separate mantle layers divided by a discontinuity at 660-kilometer depth. One cornerstone of the two-layer model is a pronounced imbalance between fluxes of heat and helium from the crust. The small helium flux suggests the existence of a boundary layer blocking the helium flow, which might be interpreted as the 660-kilometer discontinuity. In his Perspective, [AlbarA¨de][1] discusses a recent paper in Earth and Planetary Science Letters by Castro et al. in which a computer simulation supports a new view of the heat-helium flux problem. Instead of the 660-kilometer discontinuity slowing the helium flow, aquifer layers in Earth's crust could be responsible for the imbalance.
