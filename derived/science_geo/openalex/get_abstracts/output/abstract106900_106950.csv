In other vertebrate tissues, including skin, intestine, blood and neural crest, stem cells are important in maintaining a germinal population and generating differentiated progeny. By following the fates of single ventricular zone cells in culture, we show here that self-renewing, multipotential stem cells are present in the embryonic rat cerebral cortex. Forty per cent of these stem cells produced all three principal cell types of the central nervous system: neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Stem cells constituted about 7% of cortical clones; in contrast, over 80% consisted of small numbers of neurons or glia. We suggest that multipotential stem cells may be the ancestors of other cortical progenitor cells that exhibit more limited proliferation and more restricted repertoires of progeny fates."

The best documented mediator of such a retrograde trophic action is the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF and the other known members of the neurotrophin family, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5) are conserved as distinct genes over large evolutionary distances. Here we report the cloning of neurotrophin-6 (NT-6), a new member of this family from the teleost fish Xiphophorus. NT-6 distinguishes itself from the other known neurotrophins in that it is not found as a soluble protein in the medium of producing cells. The addition of heparin (but not chondroitin) effects the release of NT-6 from cell surface and extracellular matrix molecules. Recombinant purified NT-6 has a spectrum of actions similar to NGF on chick sympathetic and sensory neurons, albeit with a lower potency. NT-6 is expressed in the embryonic valvulla cerebelli; expression persists in some adult tissues. The interaction of NT-6 with heparin-binding molecules may modulate its action in the nervous system."
