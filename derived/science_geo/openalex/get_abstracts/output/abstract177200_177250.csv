Caveolin-3 (Cav-3) is the only caveolin family member expressed in striated muscle cell types (cardiac and skeletal). Interestingly, skeletal muscle fibers from Cav-3 (−/−) knock-out mice show a number of myopathic changes, consistent with a mild-to-moderate muscular dystrophy phenotype. However, it remains unknown whether a loss of Cav-3 affects the phenotypic behavior cardiac myocytes in vivo. Here, we present a detailed characterization of the hearts of Cav-3 knock-out mice. We show that these mice develop a progressive cardiomyopathic phenotype. At four months of age, Cav-3 knock-out hearts display significant hypertrophy, dilation, and reduced fractional shortening, as revealed by gated cardiac MRI and transthoracic echocardiography. Histological analysis reveals marked cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, with accompanying cellular infiltrates and progressive interstitial/peri-vascular fibrosis. Interestingly, loss of Cav-3 expression in the heart does not change the expression or the membrane association of the dystrophin-glycoprotein (DG) complex. However, a marker of the DG complex, α-sarcoglycan, was specifically excluded from lipid raft domains in the absence of Cav-3. Because activation of the Ras-p42/44 MAPK pathway in cardiac myocytes can drive cardiac hypertrophy, we next assessed the activation state of this pathway using a phospho-specific antibody probe. We show that p42/44 MAPK (ERK1/2) is hyperactivated in hearts derived from Cav-3 knock-out mice. These results are consistent with previous in vitro data demonstrating that caveolins may function as negative regulators of the p42/44 MAPK cascade. Taken together, our data argue that loss of Cav-3 expression is sufficient to induce a molecular program leading to cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and cardiomyopathy.

Cav-1 and Cav-2 are abundantly co-expressed in a variety of cell types,e.g. adipocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells, and Type-I pneumocytes. In contrast, caveolin-3 is muscle-specific, being expressed selectively in all muscle types (cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle) (6Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T., Li, S. Chafel M. Chu C.

Interestingly, Cav-3 expression is necessary for caveolae formation in skeletal muscle fibers (7Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C., Li, M. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Edelmann W.

Individual Cav-3 molecules homo-oligomerize to form high molecular mass multimers (∼14–16 monomers per oligomer), both in vitro and in vivo (2Tang Z.-L. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Song K. Chu C.

This self-assembly is thought to drive the invagination of the plasma membrane through the interaction of caveolin oligomers with cholesterol, sphingolipids, and other membrane protein components. Cav-3 expression is detectable at embryonic day 10 in mouse heart (8Biederer C.H. Ries S.J. Moser M. Florio M. Israel M.A. McCormick F. Buettner R. J. Biol.

Way M. Zorzi N. Stang E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 137-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In addition, Cav-3 (−/−) knock-out mice demonstrate dilated and longitudinally oriented T-tubules in their skeletal muscle fibers (7Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C., Li, M.

Likewise, the skeletal muscles of patients with mutations in the human CAV-3 gene (LGMD-1C)1 also show a disorganized T-tubule network (10Minetti C. Bado M. Broda P. Sotgia F. Bruno C. Galbiati F.

Members of the dystrophin-glycoprotein (DG) complex have been shown to localize to muscle caveolae (6Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T., Li, S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S. Lisanti M.P. J.

Yamada H. Venzke D.P. Lisanti M.P. Campbell K.P. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 279-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), (i) Cav-3 can directly interact with β-dystroglycan, (ii) Cav-3 is necessary for the localization of some DG complex members to lipid raft domains/caveolae in skeletal muscle fibers, and (iii) Cav-3 expression increases with the loss of dystrophin, as in mdx mice and Duchenne muscular dystrophy (7Galbiati F.

As a consequence, it is not surprising that mutations in many dystrophin-associated proteins, such as Cav-3, lead to similar forms of muscular dystrophy (15Bonnemann C.G. Modi R. Noguchi S. Mizuno Y.

Caveolae have also been shown to function as “pre-assembled” signaling complexes through the compartmentalization of signaling molecules that interact with the caveolin proteins and/or “liquid-ordered” caveolar lipids (18Smart E.J. Graf G.A. McNiven M.A. Sessa W.C. Engelman J.A. Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Lisanti M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7289-7304Crossref PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar). In the heart, a variety of signaling molecules co-fractionate with cardiac caveolae, and their residence in caveolae, or movement out of caveolae, is important for their function (19Feron O.

Furthermore, multiple studies have now shown that Cav-3 expression is dramatically decreased in different models of cardiac hypertrophy (25Lasley R.D. Narayan P. Uittenbogaard A. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4417-4421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 26Fujita T. Toya Y. Iwatsubo K. Onda T. Kimura K. Umemura S. Ishikawa Y. Cardiovasc.

This suggests that reduction of Cav-3 expression may be a pivotal event in the ensuing hypertrophic program, perhaps by allowing hypertrophy-inducing signaling cascades to remain constitutively activated. Although a role for Cav-3 in multiple skeletal muscle processes has now been investigated, the functional role of Cav-3 in the heart remains unknown. Here, we present a thorough characterization of the hearts of Cav-3 (−/−) knock-out mice. Interestingly, we show that Cav-3 knock-out mice develop a progressive, mild-to-moderate, cardiomyopathic phenotype-characterized by myocyte hypertrophy. Thus, loss of Cav-3 expression and cardiac myocyte caveolae is sufficient to induce the activation of a hypertrophic program in cardiac myocytes. Caveolin-1, -2, and -3 mAbs were the generous gift of Dr. Roberto Campos-Gonzalez (BD Transduction Laboratories, Inc.) (6Song K.S. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Okamoto T., Li, S. Chafel M. Chu C. Kohtz D.S.

Other antibodies were purchased as follows: actin mAb clone AC40 (Sigma); dystrophin mAb DYS3; α-, β-, δ-, and γ-sarcoglycan mAbs; and β-dystroglycan mAb (Novocasta); and p42/44 MAPK and phospho-p42/44 MAPK pAbs (New England BioLabs/Cell Signaling). All reagents were of the highest purity grade and were obtained from the usual commercial sources. Mice were housed and maintained in a barrier facility at the Institute for Animal Studies, Albert Einstein College of Medicine. The generation of Cav-3 KO mice was as we previously described (7Galbiati F. Engelman J.A. Volonte D. Zhang X.L. Minetti C., Li, M. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21425-21433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). WT or Cav-3 KO mice were sacrificed, and their hearts were harvested and homogenized in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 60 mm octyl glucoside), containing protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Tissue lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min to remove insoluble debris. Protein concentrations were analyzed using the BCA reagent (Pierce), and the volume required for 10 μg of protein was determined. Samples were then separated by SDS-PAGE (12.5% acrylamide) and transferred to nitrocellulose. The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (to visualize protein bands), followed by immunoblot analysis. All subsequent wash buffers contained 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (1× TBS-Tween), which was supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 2% nonfat dry milk (Carnation) for the blocking solution and 1% BSA for the antibody diluent. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: caveolin-1, -2, and -3 mAbs (1:500), actin mAb (1:5000), and α-sarcoglycan mAb (1:200). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000 dilution, Pierce for anti-mouse IgG and BD Transduction Laboratories for anti-rabbit IgG) were used to visualize bound primary antibodies with the SuperSignal chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). WT or Cav-3 KO hearts were harvested, minced with a razor blade, and homogenized for 30 s using a Polytron tissue grinder in 2 ml of MES-buffered saline with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged (1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was adjusted to 40% sucrose by the addition of 2 ml of 80% sucrose in MES-buffered saline. A 5–30% linear sucrose gradient was formed above the homogenate and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). A light-scattering band in the ∼15–20% sucrose region was observed. Twelve 1-ml fractions were collected, starting from the top of the gradient. For SDS-PAGE/Western blotting, an equal amount of total protein from each fraction (25 μg) was analyzed. WT or Cav-3 KO mice were sacrificed, their hearts were harvested, quickly washed in ice-cold PBS, and frozen in liquid nitrogen-cooled isopentane. Unfixed frozen sections were incubated in blocking solution (10% horse serum, 1% BSA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1× TBS-Tween; no horse serum was used for α-sarcoglycan or dystrophin) for 30 min at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: dystrophin NCL3 (1:50); α-sarcoglycan (1:100); β-sarcoglycan (1:100); δ-sarcoglycan (1:100); γ-sarcoglycan (1:100); and β-dystroglycan (1:50), in TBS-Tween/1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Rhodamine Red-X-Conjugated AffiniPure F(ab′)2 fragment goat anti-mouse secondary IgG (1:150) in 1% BSA TBS-Tween was applied for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were mounted with Slow-Fade anti-fade reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.) and observed under a Bio-Rad MR 600 confocal microscope. Heart tissue samples were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1m cacodylate buffer, post-fixed with OsO4, and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. Microtome sections were examined under a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope and photographed at a magnification of 15,000×. Caveolae were identified by their characteristic flask shape, size (50–100 nm), and location at or near the plasma membrane. Mice were sacrificed, and their hearts were removed and placed in buffered formalin (10%). The tissue was fixed for ∼24 h, washed in PBS for 20 min, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol washes, treated with xylene for 40 min, and then embedded in paraffin for 1 h at 55 °C. Paraffin-embedded 5-μm-thick sections were then prepared using a Microm (Baxter Scientific) microtome and placed on super-frost plus slides (Fisher). Slides were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E) or Trichrome, according to standard laboratory protocols. Samples were examined by an experienced cardiac pathologist (Dr. Stephen M. Factor). MRI experiments were performed using a General Electric Omega 9.4T vertical bore MR system equipped with a micro-imaging accessory and custom-built coils designed specifically for mice, as described previously (31Jelicks L.A. Shirani J. Wittner M. Chandra M. Weiss L.M. Factor S.M. Bekirov I. Braunstein V.L. Chan J. Huang H. Tanowitz H.B. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1999; 61: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Just prior to each image acquisition, the heart rate was determined from the electrocardiogram, and the spectrometer gating delay was set to acquire data in diastole and systole. Multislice spin-echo imaging with an echo time of 18 ms and a repetition time of ∼100–200 ms was performed. A 35-mm field of view (with a 256- × 256-pixel image matrix) was used. Short and long axis images of the heart were acquired, and MRI data were processed off-line with MATLAB-based custom-designed software. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed as described previously (32Chandra M. Shirani J. Shtutin V. Weiss L.M. Factor S.M. Petkova S.B. Rojkind M. Dominguez-Rosales J.A. Jelicks L.A. Morris S.A. Wittner M. Tanowitz H.B. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002; 32: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Echocardiography was performed with mice in a supine position on a heating pad set at 38 °C. Light anesthesia was achieved using isoflurane inhalation. Continuous, standard electrocardiograms were taken from electrodes placed on the extremities. Echocardiographic images were obtained using an annular array, broadband, 10/5-MHz transducer attached to an HDI 5000 CV ultrasound system (Advanced Technology Laboratories, Bothell, WA). A small gel standoff was placed between the probe and chest. Two-dimensional and M-mode images of the heart were obtained from the basal short axis view of the heart and stored on 3/4-inch SVHS videotapes for off-line measurements using the Nova-Microsonic (Kodak) Imagevue DCR workstation (Indianapolis, IN). All measurements were made in three to six consecutive cardiac cycles, and the averaged values were used for analysis. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters as well as diastolic ventricular septal and posterior wall thicknesses were measured from M-mode tracings. Diastolic measurements were performed at the point of greatest cavity dimension, and systolic measurements were made at the point of minimal cavity dimension, using the leading edge method of the American Society of Echocardiography (33Schiller N.B. Circulation. 1991; 84 (Suppl. 3): I280-I287Google Scholar). Additionally, the following parameters were calculated using the above-mentioned measurements: left ventricular diastolic wall thickness was calculated as the average of ventricular septal and left ventricular posterior wall thicknesses; left ventricular percent fractional shortening was measured using the equation, 100 × [(end-diastolic diameter minus end-systolic diameter)/end-diastolic diameter]; and relative wall thickness was measured using the equation, (2 × left ventricular diastolic wall thickness)/end-diastolic diameter. Note that differences between the “absolute” wall thicknesses measured using MRI and echocardiography are commonly observed and are likely due to technical factors such as differences in the time of gating; echocardiography may underestimate these values, whereas MRI may overestimate these values. Most importantly, however, the relative changes measured in left ventricular wall thickness using MRI and echocardiography are in agreement. For the analysis of phospho-proteins, WT and Cav-3 KO hearts were harvested, quickly rinsed in PBS (1×), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen hearts were then homogenized in 3 ml of boiling lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% SDS, 1.0 mm sodium orthovanadate), heated in a microwave for 15 s, and centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 × g to pellet any insoluble material. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and aliquots (1:10 dilution) were prepared for protein concentration analysis. Twenty micrograms of protein was run on SDS-PAGE gels and analyzed by Western blotting. Blood pressure measurements were taken on both WT and Cav-3 KO mice by placing them in a mouse restrainer (RTBP007, Kent Scientific, Inc.) and applying a mouse occlusion cuff (RTBP050, Kent Scientific, Inc.) and mouse plethysmographic cuff (XBP051, Kent Scientific, Inc.) to the tail of the mouse. A heat lamp was used to warm the mice. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements were taken using the XBP1000 apparatus (Kent Scientific, Inc.) connected to a data acquisition system. The occlusion pressure corresponding to the minimal and maximal plethysmographic signals were taken to be the systolic and diastolic pressures, respectively. Hearts were harvested from WT and Cav-3 KO mice and examined by Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A). Note that genetic ablation of the Cav-3 gene resulted in the complete loss of the Cav-3 protein from the heart. However, the expression levels of Cav-1 and Cav-2 were unaffected by a lack of Cav-3 expression. Immunoblotting with anti-actin IgG was also performed as a control for equal protein loading.Figure 1Cav-3 KO mice do not express caveolin-3 in the heart and lack cardiac myocyte caveolae. A, Western blotting. Hearts were harvested from wild-type and Cav-3 KO mice. Tissue lysates were prepared (see “Experimental Procedures”) and subjected to SDS-PAGE/transfer to nitrocellulose. Blots were probed with isoform-specific mAbs that selectively recognize either caveolin-1, caveolin-2, or caveolin-3. Note that there is a complete loss of caveolin-3 in Cav-3 KO mouse hearts, without any changes in the expression levels of caveolin-1 or caveolin-2 as compared with wild-type (WT) control mice. Immunoblotting with anti-actin IgG is shown as a control for equal protein loading. B, immunostaining (cross-sections). Frozen sections of the heart were prepared from wild-type and Cav-3 KO mice and immunostained with antibodies directed against either caveolin-1, caveolin-2, or caveolin-3. Note that caveolin-3 is localized to the plasma membrane (sarcolemma) of wild-type cardiac myocytes (panel a) but is completely absent in heart tissue derived from Cav-3 KO mice (panel d). In contrast, caveolin-1 and caveolin-2 expression is exclusively restricted to the endothelium and endocardium (seewhite arrowheads) as expected and remains unchanged in Cav-3 KO heart tissue (caveolin-1, panels b and e; caveolin-2, panels c and f). chamber, left ventricle chamber. C, immunostaining (longitudinal sections). Frozen sections of the heart were prepared from wild-type mice and immunostained with antibodies directed against caveolin-3. The fluorescence image and the corresponding phase image are shown; arrowheads indicate the Z-lines. Note that the Z-lines identified in the phase image clearly coincide with the immunostaining pattern observed for caveolin-3. D, cell fractionation. Hearts were harvested from wild-type and Cav-3 KO mice. Tissue lysates were prepared and subjected to sucrose density gradient analysis. In the wild-type heart, note that caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 are localized to the “light” buoyant density area of the gradient that contains lipid rafts/caveolae (fractions 5 and6). In Cav-3 KO heart, caveolin-1 remains localized to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions as expected, because caveolin-1 is expressed in the endothelium and endocardium of the heart.E, transmission electron microscopy. Heart tissue samples were fixed and embedded as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Caveolae were identified by their characteristic flask shape, size (50–100 nm), and location at or near the plasma membrane.Arrowheads indicate detached caveolae, whereas arrows are used to indicate caveolae that remain attached to the plasma membrane. Note that in wild-type animals caveolae are present in both the cardiac myocyte and adjacent endothelial cell. In contrast, in Cav-3 KO animals there is a selective loss of muscle caveolae in the cardiac myocyte, whereas the adjacent endothelial cell retains its non-muscle caveolae.

As expected, Cav-3 expression was not detectable in sections of Cav-3 KO hearts; most importantly, Cav-1 and Cav-2 expression remained properly restricted to the endocardium and endothelium in Cav-3 KO hearts, indicating that there was no compensatory up-regulation of Cav-1 and Cav-2 in Cav-3 null cardiac myocytes (Fig. 1 B, panels d–f). Longitudinal sections demonstrate that Cav-3 co-localized with the Z-line patterning of the myocardium as well as the plasma membrane (Fig. 1 C). This is consistent with an association between Cav-3 and the T-tubule system in cardiac myocytes, because the T-tubule system is in register with the Z-lines in the heart, as opposed to the A-I bands within skeletal muscle. Due to their “liquid-ordered” and “buoyant” properties, caveolae can be isolated by tissue solubilization in the detergent Triton X-100 at 4 °C, followed by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation (34Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Vidugiriene J. Tang Z.-L. Hermanoski- Vosatka A., Tu, Y.-H. Cook R.F. Sargiacomo M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 111-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In wild-type hearts, note that caveolin-1 and caveolin-3 were localized to the “light” buoyant density area of the gradient that contained lipid rafts/caveolae (Fig.1 D, fractions 5 and 6). In Cav-3 KO hearts, caveolin-1 remained localized to the lipid raft/caveolae fractions as expected, because caveolin-1 is expressed in the endothelium and endocardium of the heart. Transmission electron microscopy revealed that caveolae are found in both the endothelium and myocardium of wild-type mouse hearts (Fig.1 E). However, disruption of the Cav-3 gene resulted in the complete loss of caveolae only in the cardiac myocytes, thus demonstrating at the structural level the necessity of Cav-3 expression for the formation of cardiac myocyte caveolae. However, the morphology and number of Cav-1-generated caveolae within the endothelium was unaffected. Wild-type and Cav-3 KO hearts were next analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (31Jel"

Here we demonstrate that the expression of the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin is selectively induced in C2C12 myoblasts that are resistant to differentiation-induced apoptosis, and we show that this induction occurs at an early stage in their differentiation in vitro. In contrast, the expression of several known anti-apoptotic proteins (FLIP, XIAP, Bcl-xL) was not altered during myogenesis. We also demonstrate that ectopic expression of αB-crystallin, but not the closely related small heat shock protein Hsp27, renders C2C12 myoblasts resistant to differentiation-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, we show that the myopathy-causing R120G αB-crystallin mutant is partly impaired in its cytoprotective function, whereas a pseudophosphorylation αB-crystallin mutant that mimics stress-induced phosphorylation is completely devoid of anti-apoptotic activity. Finally, we demonstrate that αB-crystallin negatively regulates apoptosis during myogenesis by inhibiting the proteolytic activation of caspase-3, whereas the R120G and pseudophosphorylation mutants are defective in this function.

Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although the acquisition of apoptosis resistance by myogenic precursors is a critical event in their differentiation, only a few genes that regulate this process have been identified. One such gene is the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 whose expression is induced at an early stage of myogenesis by the skeletal muscle-specific transcriptional regulator MyoD (2Halevy O. Novitch B.G. Spicer D.B. Skapek S.X. Rhee J. Hannon G.J. Beach D. Lassar A.B. Science. 1995; 267: 1018-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar, 3Parker S.B. Eichele G. Zhang P. Rawls A.

The anti-apoptotic kinase Akt is also induced during skeletal muscle development and promotes the survival of differentiating myoblasts, although its anti-apoptotic mechanism(s) in muscle is unclear (5Fujio Y. Guo K. Mano T. Mitsuuchi Y. Testa J.R. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5073-5082Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6Jiang B.H. Aoki M. Zheng J.Z., Li, J. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Finally, Bcl-2, a protein that inhibits many of the mitochondrial events in apoptosis, is transiently expressed in myogenic precursors and promotes their clonal expansion (8Dominov J.A. Dunn J.J. Miller J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, given the complexity of the apoptotic cell death apparatus (9Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), it seems likely that other genes play important roles in myogenic apoptosis. One particularly intriguing candidate is αB-crystallin, a member of the small heat shock protein (HSP)1 family that also includes αA-crystallin, Hsp27, Hsp20, Hsp22, myotonic dystrophy protein kinase-binding protein (MKBP)/HspB2, and HspB3 (10Clark J.I.

With the exception of αA-crystallin, all of the small HSPs are abundantly expressed in muscle tissue where they function as molecular chaperones that facilitate refolding of non-native proteins (10Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M. Tsui S.K. Yoshida S. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Structurally, each of the small HSPs contains a highly conserved α-crystallin domain flanked by largely non-conserved amino and carboxyl termini. We postulated that αB-crystallin might be an important regulator of apoptosis during myogenesis for a number of reasons. First, the expression of αB-crystallin is induced early during skeletal myogenesis in vivo and in vitroand is regulated by MyoD (11Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M.

Garry D.J. Richardson J.A. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 208: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Second, αB-crystallin and the related small heat shock protein Hsp27 confer resistance to apoptosis induced by a wide range of stimuli (16Mehlen P. Kretz-Remy C. Preville X. Arrigo A.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2695-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have recently demonstrated that αB-crystallin negatively regulates TNF-α- and DNA damage-induced apoptosis by a novel mechanism; αB-crystallin inhibits the activation of caspase-3, a key pro-apoptotic protease (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Third, a missense mutation of αB-crystallin (R120G) has been shown to cause an autosomal dominant myopathy characterized by the disruption of myofibrils and the accumulation of aggregates of desmin and αB-crystallin in degenerating muscle cells (19Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P., Li, Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Biochemically, the R120G mutant is severely compromised in its chaperone activity (20Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6137-6142Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar,21Perng M.D. Muchowski P.J. van Den I.P., Wu, G.J. Hutcheson A.M. Clark J.I. Quinlan R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33235-33243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Fourth, mice with targeted deletion of the αB-crystallin gene, and the adjacent HspB2 gene, develop a progressive myopathy (22Brady J.P. Garland D.L. Green D.E. Tamm E.R. Giblin F.J. Wawrousek E.F. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 2924-2934PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that αB-crystallin may promote muscle survival during differentiation and in response to stress. In this report, we demonstrate that the expression of αB-crystallin is selectively induced in surviving C2C12 myoblasts at an early stage in their differentiation in vitro. Moreover, we show that ectopic expression of αB-crystallin, but not Hsp27, is sufficient to inhibit differentiation-induced myoblast apoptosis. We also demonstrate that the myopathy-causing R120G mutant is partly impaired in its cytoprotective function, whereas a pseudophosphorylation αB-crystallin mutant that mimics stress-induced phosphorylation is completely defective in its anti-apoptotic function. Finally, we show that αB-crystallin negatively regulates differentiation-induced myoblast apoptosis by inhibiting the proteolytic activation of caspase-3. Overall, our findings demonstrate for the first time that the small HSP αB-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of myogenic apoptosis that directly links the differentiation program to apoptosis resistance. Murine C2C12 cells were maintained in growth medium (GM): Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). To induce differentiation, cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and transferred to differentiation medium (DM): Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting as described (23Cryns V.L. Bergeron L. Zhu H., Li, H. Yuan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31277-31282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) using the following Abs: αB-crystallin (StressGen), Hsp27 (StressGen), tubulin (Sigma), desmin (Sigma), p21 (Oncogene Science), M2 FLAG (Sigma), FLIPL(kindly provided by Dr. H. Perlman), XIAP (BD PharMingen), and Bcl-xL (BD PharMingen). The FLAG-tagged, wild-type human αB-crystallin and Hsp27 cDNAs have been described previously (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The R120G mutant αB-crystallin cDNA was made using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CTCCAGGGAGTTCCACGGGAAATACCGGATCCC-3′ and 5′-GGGATCCGGTATTTCCCGTGGAACTCCCTGGAG-3′. The triple pseudophosphorylation mutant αB-crystallin cDNA (S19E,S45E,S59E, abbreviated 3XSE) was made using this same site-directed mutagenesis kit by sequentially altering each of these serine residues using the following primers: 5′-CCCTTCTTTCCTTTCCACGAACCCAGCCGCCTCTTTGAC-3′ and 5′-GTCAAAGAGGCGGCTGGGTTCGTGGAAAGGAAAGAAGGG-3′ (S19E), 5′-CCGACGTCTACTTCCCTGGAACCCTTCTACCTTCGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCGAAGGTAGAAGGGTTCCAGGGAAGTAGACGTCGG-3′ (S45E), 5′-CCTTCCTGCGGGCACCCGAATGGTTTGACACTGGACTC-3′ and 5′-GAGTCCAGTGTCAAACCATTCGGGTGCCCGCAGGAAGG-3′ (S59E). The αB-crystallin cDNA encoding amino acids 1–161 and lacking its carboxyl-terminal 14 amino acids (ΔC) was PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-GGCCGAATTCATGGACATCGCCATCCACCAC-3′ and 5′-GGCCCTCGAGGATGGGAATGGTGCGCTCAGGGCC-3′. The PCR product was then digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into a modified pcDNA3 vector in which a sequence encoding FLAG was inserted upstream of the multiple cloning site. All sequences were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. C2C12 cells were grown on glass coverslips to 40% confluence in GM and transiently transfected with 1 μg of control vector (pEGFPN1, CLONTECH) or pcDNA3-FLAG plasmid containing wild-type or mutant αB-crystallin or Hsp27. For the co-transfection experiments (Fig. 3 D), myoblasts were co-transfected with 0.4 μg of pEGFPN1 and 0.8 μg of plasmids containing αB-crystallin, p21, Bcl-2, wild-type Akt, or Hsp27. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 24-h incubation, C2C12 cells were washed and transferred to DM for an additional 24 h prior to their analysis by immunofluorescence. To detect ectopically expressed cDNAs, C2C12 cells were prepared as above. To detect the endogenous αB-crystallin, C2C12 cells were grown to 40% confluence on glass coverslips in GM, washed twice in PBS, and transferred to DM for 0–72 h. Cells were then fixed in 100% methanol for 2 min at −20 °C and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C with αB-crystallin mAb (1:500 dilution in PBS) to detect the endogenous protein or with FLAG M2 mAb (Sigma, 1:500) to detect the ectopically expressed proteins. After incubation with the primary Ab, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat affinity-purified Ab to mouse IgG (ICN Pharmaceuticals, 1:20) and 10 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C. For co-immunofluorescence studies, a polyclonal Ab that recognizes the active, large subunit of caspase-3 (CM1, BD PharMingen, 1:250) was used for 2 h at 37 °C followed by a rhodamine-conjugated antibody to rabbit IgG (1:200). The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by scoring fragmented/condensed nuclei by fluorescence microscopy as detailed (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 24Byun Y. Chen F. Chang R. Trivedi M. Green K. Cryns V. Cell Death Differ. 2001; 8: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In each experiment, at least 200 cells were counted, and experiments were performed in triplicate. Statistical significance was assessed by a two-tailed, paired Student's t test. To begin to determine whether αB-crystallin might play a role in regulating apoptosis during myogenesis, we examined its expression in C2C12 myoblasts that were induced to undergo differentiation by mitogen withdrawal, a well characterized in vitro model (1Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). C2C12 myoblasts were grown in DM containing 0.5% FBS for 0–72 h, and the expression of αB-crystallin was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig.1 A, the expression of αB-crystallin was rapidly induced in myoblasts within 4 h of transfer to DM and increased in a time-dependent manner throughout the entire 72-h interval, a critical period during which myoblasts differentiate into multinucleated myotubes and become resistant to apoptosis (see Fig. 2 and Ref. 1Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Indeed, the myogenic induction of αB-crystallin expression preceded that of desmin, a muscle-specific intermediate filament protein that is one of the earliest markers of myogenic commitment (25Kaufman S.J. Foster R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9606-9610Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar,26Schaart G. Viebahn C. Langmann W. Raemakers F. Development. 1989; 107: 581-616Google Scholar), and p21, a mediator of cell cycle exit and apoptosis resistance (1Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of Hsp27, a closely related small HSP, was transiently increased at a later time point (18–24 h), its expression falling below baseline levels at 48–72 h in DM. Furthermore, the expression levels of other anti-apoptotic proteins (XIAP, FLIPL, and Bcl-xL) were not significantly altered during myogenic differentiation (Fig.1 B). Interestingly, the induction of αB-crystallin expression observed in C2C12 myoblasts during differentiation was similar to that observed in these cells in response to heat shock at 44 °C for 1 h (Fig. 1 C).Figure 2αB-crystallin is preferentially expressed in surviving myoblasts during myogenesis. C2C12 myoblasts were grown in DM for 0–72 h, and then cells were examined for αB-crystallin expression by indirect immunofluorescence and scored for apoptotic (condensed/fragmented) nuclei as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A, representative photomicrographs showing αB-crystallin expression (upper panels) and nuclear morphology (lower panels, the nuclei corresponding to αB-crystallin-positive myoblasts are indicated by arrows). B, the data represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments (*,p < 0.05 for αB-negative versusαB-positive cells at each time point).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If the expression of αB-crystallin confers resistance to myogenic apoptosis, αB-crystallin should be selectively expressed in surviving myoblasts. To examine this hypothesis, C2C12 cells were transferred to DM for 0–72 h, and cells were then simultaneously examined for αB-crystallin expression by immunofluorescence and for the induction of apoptosis by nuclear morphology; cells with condensed or fragmented nuclei were scored as apoptotic. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the vast majority of C2C12 cells expressing αB-crystallin had intact nuclei (the nuclei corresponding to αB-crystallin-positive myoblasts are indicated byarrows in the lower panels) even after 72 h in DM, whereas virtually all of the apoptotic myoblasts with fragmented/condensed nuclei lacked αB-crystallin. These results are presented quantitatively in Fig. 2 B. Indeed, αB-crystallin-negative myoblasts had dramatically higher rates of differentiation-induced apoptosis than αB-crystallin-positive cells at 24, 48, and 72 h after transfer to DM. This striking inverse correlation between the induction of apoptosis and the expression of αB-crystallin suggests that αB-crystallin may promote myoblast survival during differentiation. We next wanted to determine whether ectopic expression of αB-crystallin was sufficientto protect myoblasts from differentiation-induced apoptosis. C2C12 cells were transiently transfected with empty vector or FLAG-tagged cDNAs encoding wild-type αB-crystallin or Hsp27. After overnight incubation, cells were transferred to DM for 24 h. Transfected cells were then identified by immunofluorescence with an anti-FLAG mAb, and the percentage of transfected cells with apoptotic nuclei was determined. As shown in Fig.3 A, ectopic expression of wild-type αB-crystallin potently inhibited differentiation-induced myoblast apoptosis. In contrast, Hsp27 did not significantly inhibit differentiation-induced myoblast apoptosis, thereby underscoring the specificity of the role of αB-crystallin in regulating this process. To delineate the domains of αB-crystallin that mediate its anti-apoptotic actions, we examined the ability of several well defined αB-crystallin mutants to inhibit differentiation-induced myoblast apoptosis. Specifically, we used the following mutant constructs: (i) the myopathy-causing R120G missense mutation, which severely impairs its chaperone activity (19Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P., Li, Z.

Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar); and (iii) a truncated αB-crystallin, which lacks its carboxyl-terminal tail (ΔC), a region which mediates substrate binding and stabilizes the protein (10Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar,29Plater M.L. Goode D. Crabbe M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28558-28566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These mutant proteins were expressed at levels comparable with those of wild-type αB-crystallin and Hsp27 in transiently transfected C2C12 myoblasts (see Fig. 3 C). As shown in Fig.3 B, the R120G and ΔC mutants were partly impaired in their ability to protect myoblasts from differentiation-induced apoptosis compared with wild-type αB-crystallin. In contrast, the 3XSE triple pseudophosphorylation mutant was completely devoid of anti-apoptotic activity. Because stress-induced phosphorylation of these Ser residues triggers the dissociation of the large oligomeric complexes of αB-crystallin (28Ito H. Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), our findings strongly suggest that the anti-apoptotic function of αB-crystallin is tightly linked to its oligomerization state. Importantly, as demonstrated in Fig.3 D, the degree of apoptosis inhibition conferred by αB-crystallin was similar to that of p21, a previously described regulator of myocyte survival (1Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar), whereas neither Bcl-2 nor wild-type Akt significantly inhibited myogenic apoptosis under these conditions. Because we have previously demonstrated that αB-crystallin negatively regulates TNF-α- and DNA damage-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3 (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether αB-crystallin inhibited myogenic apoptosis by the same mechanism. To this end, we transferred C2C12 myoblasts to DM for 72 h and examined cells for expression of αB-crystallin and active caspase-3; the latter was detected using an antibody that specifically recognizes the large subunit of activatedcaspase-3 (and does not detect pro-caspase-3). As shown in Fig.4 A, the vast majority of C2C12 cells that expressed αB-crystallin (left panel) had non-apoptotic nuclear morphology (middle panel, the nuclei corresponding to αB-crystallin-positive cells are indicated byarrows, some of which are multinucleated) and lacked active caspase-3 (right panel), whereas only a very small percentage of cells that expressed active caspase-3 also expressed αB-crystallin (see Fig. 4 B). Moreover, as demonstrated in Fig. 4 C, transient transfection of wild-type αB-crystallin, but not Hsp27, was sufficient to inhibit myogenesis-induced caspase-3 activation, again underscoring the specificity of our observations. In contrast, each of the αB-crystallin mutants (R120G, ΔC, and 3XSE) was impaired in its ability to inhibit caspase-3 activation; the 3XSE mutant was most severely impaired, consistent with its complete loss of anti-apoptotic function. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that αB-crystallin inhibits myogenic apoptosis by disrupting caspase-3 activation. We have demonstrated that αB-crystallin is a novel negative regulator of myogenic apoptosis; its expression is selectively induced in surviving myoblasts during an early stage of their differentiationin vitro. Indeed, the αB-crystallin promoter contains a canonical skeletal muscle-specific E-box element that binds MyoD family members and accounts for the early expression of αB-crystallin during skeletal myogenesis (11Sugiyama Y.

In this way, αB-crystallin provides a direct and previously unrecognized link between the myogenic differentiation program and the acquisition of apoptosis resistance, the latter event being a critical step in myogenesis because apoptosis-sensitive myogenic precursors are eliminated (1Wang J. Walsh K. Science. 1996; 273: 359-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Although a few other regulators of myogenic apoptosis have been described (1Wang J. Walsh K.

Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), αB-crystallin is the first HSP to be implicated in this process. Interestingly, we observed that Hsp27, a protein ∼40% identical to αB-crystallin (10Clark J.I. Muchowski P.J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 11Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M. Tsui S.K. Yoshida S. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), was only transiently induced during myogenic differentiation and did not confer resistance to differentiation-induced apoptosis, thereby indicating that there is considerable specificity among HSPs with respect to their role in myogenic cell death. Moreover, our finding that several other anti-apoptotic proteins (XIAP, FLIPL, and Bcl-xL) were not induced during skeletal myogenesis indicates that the apoptosis resistance acquired by myogenic precursors represents the activation of a specific subset of anti-apoptotic proteins. However, the long term survival of a subset of αB-crystallin-negative myoblasts indicates that other anti-apoptotic proteins must also contribute to the apoptosis resistance of mature myocytes. We have also demonstrated that αB-crystallin antagonizes myogenic apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspase-3. This observation is consistent with our previous findings in cancer cells that αB-crystallin inhibits caspase-3 activation by disrupting its proteolytic maturation (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). In contrast, Hsp27 did not inhibit myogenic differentiation-induced caspase-3 activation or apoptosis. This latter finding provides additional evidence that the anti-apoptotic mechanisms of these closely related small HSPs are likely to be quite distinct. Indeed, we have demonstrated previously that Hsp27 does not directly inhibit the proteolytic maturation of caspase-3 (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Instead, Hsp27 has been reported to inhibit apoptosis by binding to cytosolic cytochrome c and preventing the recruitment of pro-caspase-9 to the apoptosome (30Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), a cytosolic caspase-9 activating complex composed of cytochrome c, APAF-1, and pro-caspase-9 (9Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). In this way, Hsp27 inhibits the activation of caspase-9, the apical caspase in the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway (30Bruey J.M. Ducasse C. Bonniaud P. Ravagnan L. Susin S.A. Diaz-Latoud C. Gurbuxani S. Arrigo A.P. Kroemer G. Solary E. Garrido C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 645-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar), whereas αB-crystallin only weakly inhibits caspase-9 activation (17Kamradt M.C. Chen F. Cryns V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16059-16063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Recently, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway has been reported to be inactive in skeletal muscle due to the absence of APAF-1 in skeletal muscle (31Burgess D.H. Svensson M. Dandrea T. Gronlund K. Hammarquist F Orrenius S. Cotgreave I.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), thereby potentially accounting for the inability of Hsp27 to inhibit myogenic apoptosis. We have also reported for the first time structure-function analyses of the anti-apoptotic domains of αB-crystallin. We observed that the myopathy-causing R120G mutation and deletion of its carboxyl-terminal tail partly suppressed the ability of αB-crystallin to inhibit differentiation-induced caspase-3 activation and apoptosis, whereas a pseudophosphorylation triple mutant that mimics stress-induced phosphorylation was severely impaired in these functions. Because each of these mutations likely diminishes the chaperone activity of αB-crystallin (20Bova M.P. Yaron O. Huang Q. Ding L. Haley D.A. Stewart P.L. Horwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kamei K. Iwamoto I. Inaguma Y. Nohara D. Kato K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5346-5352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), these findings strongly suggest that oligomerization of αB-crystallin is essential for its cytoprotective actions, as has been demonstrated for Hsp27 in other systems (32Rogalla T. Ehrnsperger M. Preville X. Kotlyarov A. Lutsch G. Ducasse C. Paul C. Wieske M. Arrigo A.P. Buchner J. Gaestel M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18947-18956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the novel anti-apoptotic function of αB-crystallin reported here and the impaired ability of the R120G mutant to inhibit caspase-3 activation may provide new insights into the etiology of the progressive myopathy caused by this mutation (19Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P., Li, Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A. Chateau D. Chapon F. Tome F. Dupret J.M. Paulin D. Fardeau M. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Although the R120G mutant is also compromised in its ability to stabilize desmin intermediate filaments, thereby resulting in the accumulation of aggregates of desmin and αB-crystallin and the disruption of myofibrils (19Vicart P.

Res. 2001; 89: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), the defect in its ability to inhibit caspase-3 activation would likely sensitize muscle cells to stress-induced apoptosis. Indeed, the observation that the R120G mutation in patients or in transgenic mice causes muscle degeneration in early adulthood (19Vicart P. Caron A. Guicheney P., Li, Z. Prevost M.C. Faure A.

Hewett T. Robbins J. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) suggests that the cumulative oxidative stress of years of contractile activity is required to unmask the deleterious consequences of this mutation in vivo. Finally, given the central role that caspase-3 plays in the execution of apoptosis (9Cryns V.L. Yuan J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1551-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar), our results suggest that αB-crystallin may participate broadly in the regulation of muscle cell death.

What triggers stress-induced premature senescence (SIPS) and how similar this mechanism is to replicative senescence are not well understood. It has been suggested that stress-induced senescence is caused by rapid telomere shortening resulting from DNA damage. In order to test this hypothesis directly, we examined whether overexpression of the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) can protect cells from SIPS. We therefore analyzed the response of four different lines of normal human fibroblasts with and without hTERT to stress induced by UV, γ-irradiation, and H2O2. SIPS was induced with the same efficiency in normal and hTERT-immortalized cells. This suggests that SIPS is not triggered by telomere shortening and that nonspecific DNA damage serves as a signal for induction of SIPS. Although telomerase did not protect cells from SIPS, fibroblasts expressing hTERT were more resistant to stress-induced apoptosis and necrosis. We hypothesize that healing of DNA breaks by telomerase inhibits the induction of cell death, but because healing does not provide legitimate DNA repair, it does not protect cells from SIPS.

Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5210-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Cells undergoing SIPS display all the major characteristics of replicatively senescent cells; they are large and flat, stain positive for SA-β-gal, accumulate p21, and contain hypophosphorylated Rb. Furthermore, it has been shown that the expression pattern in cells undergoing SIPS is similar to that of replicatively senescent cells (15Saretzki G. Feng J. von Zglinicki T. Villeponteau B. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 1998; 53: B438-B442Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The molecular events that trigger SIPS are far from clear. It has been observed that telomeres shorten 5–10 times faster in cells grown under chronic hyperoxia (13von Zglinicki T.S.G. Docke W. Lotze C. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 220: 186-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 16Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S., Wu, Y. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Accelerated telomere shortening was also observed after stress with SIPS-inducing concentrations of H2O2(17von Zglinicki T. Pilger R. Sitte N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 28: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that induction of the p53-dependent cell cycle arrest via generation of nonspecific as well as telomere-specific DNA damage is the trigger of SIPS (7Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 927-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). Chen et al. (18Chen Q.M. Prowse K.R., Tu, V.C. Purdom S. Linskens M.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 265: 294-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), however, did not observe telomere shortening in the cells undergoing SIPS after H2O2 treatment. It has also been shown that Ras-induced senescence, which represents another type of premature senescence, is telomere-independent and cannot be rescued by overexpression of hTERT (19Morales C.P. Holt I. Ouellette M. Kaur K.J. Yan Y. Wilson K.S. White M.A. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 20Wei S. Wei S. Sedivy J.M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1539-1543PubMed Google Scholar). However, expression of oncogenic Ras triggers senescence via the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (21Lin A.W. Barradas M. Stone J.C. van Aelst L. Serrano M. Lowe S.W. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3008-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar), which is likely to be a pathway distinct from DNA damage-induced senescence. We therefore designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that accumulation of DNA breaks in telomeres and rapid telomere shortening was the primary cause of SIPS. We also aimed to test whether nonspecific DNA damage could cause senescence or whether the senescent phenotype was strictly telomere-dependent. We compared the induction of SIPS by UV and γ-irradiation and H2O2 in four different lines of normal human fibroblasts with and without hTERT. Our predictions were that if SIPS was triggered by telomere shortening, the presence of telomerase activity should render the cells more resistant to SIPS. On the other hand, if SIPS could be caused by nonspecific DNA damage, then overexpression of hTERT would have no effect. We observed no difference in the induction of SIPS between fibroblasts that did or did not express hTERT, as monitored by morphological changes, growth arrest, and SA-β-gal activity. This result suggests that SIPS is triggered by nonspecific DNA damage and most likely is telomere-independent. We also tested whether SIPS required p21 by inducing SIPS in p21−/− human fibroblasts. p21 accumulates in cells entering replicative senescence, and it has been demonstrated that p21−/− fibroblasts do not undergo replicative senescence (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). We observed that SIPS was attenuated in p21−/− cells, suggesting that SIPS and replicative senescence share some common pathways. However, the inhibition of SIPS in p21−/− cells was ∼50%, in contrast to replicative senescence, which is completely blocked in these cells. We have also found that hTERT-expressing cells were more resistant to apoptosis and necrosis induced by UV and γ-irradiation. A protective effect of telomerase on induction of apoptosis was recently reported (23Fu W. Begley J.G. Killen M.W. Mattson M.P. J. Biol.

Mech. Ageing Dev. 2001; 122: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and may attenuate apoptosis by some interaction with the apoptotic machinery (26Xiang H. Wang J. Mao Y.W. Li D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 278: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We observed the strongest protective effect of hTERT in cells treated with UV and γ-irradiation, known inducers of DNA double-strand breaks, and almost no protection against H2O2 damage, which affects many other cell compartments in addition to DNA. This suggests that the protective mechanism works at the DNA level. We hypothesize that telomerase protects cells from apoptosis and necrosis by a healing process, such as adding telomeric repeats to broken DNA ends.

Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5707) Google Scholar). Cells were counted under the microscope, and a minimum of 500 cells was counted for each coverslip. The percent β-galactosidase-positive cells from the total number of cells was calculated. Thymidine incorporation assay was performed as described (29Stein G.H. Yanishevsky R. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 58: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips, 3–4 days after treatment, and [3H]thymidine was added to the cells. Cells were then incubated for an additional 36 h and fixed and subjected to autoradiography, and the percentage of cells incorporating tritiated thymidine was determined. Ten days after treatment genomic DNA was extracted from 2 × 106 cells, digested with the mixture of restriction enzymes (AluI, HaeIII, RsaI, andHinfI), and fractionated on 0.8% agarose gel. DNA fragments were transferred to nylon membrane (Hybond-N+) under alkali conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Membranes were hybridized for 12 h at 55 °C with a radiolabeled (TTAGGG)4 probe, washed, and subjected to autoradiography. Cells were collected 48 and 72 h after post-treatment, stained with acridine orange, and analyzed by FACS (Beckman-Coulter, EPICS XL-MCL, using System II version 3.0) as described (30Darzynkiewicz Z. Methods Cell Biol. 1994; 41: 427-541Google Scholar). Apoptotic and necrotic fractions were identified as described (31Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Falcovitz A. Sigal A. Milyavsky M. Zurer I. Shohat G. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), using etoposide and actinomycin-treated young and old cells as standards. The cellular DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used for the detection of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd)-labeled DNA released from necrotic cells into the cell medium. Briefly, 24 h before stress treatment cells were incubated with BrdUrd. At various time points after stress treatments the supernatants of the cell cultures were collected, and DNA fragments were captured with an anti-DNA antibody and detected by an anti-BrdUrd antibody-peroxidase conjugate according to the manufacturer's instructions. Adherent fibroblasts were harvested and lysed in protein sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and equal numbers of cells loaded on SDS-PAGE. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane using a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were hybridized with the following antibodies: anti-p21 (WAF1(Ab1), Oncogene), anti-Rb (Rb Ab1(1F8), LabVision), anti-p53 (pAb1801 Calbiochem), and anti-p16 (p16 Ab1(DCS-50.1/A7) LabVision). Equivalent loading of lanes was verified by hybridization with anti-actin antibodies (Calbiochem). Introduction of telomerase into human fibroblasts allows them to escape replicative senescence (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). To test whether telomerase could protect the cells from SIPS, we compared the induction of SIPS in normal human fibroblasts cell lines with and without telomerase. We have used four lines of fibroblasts that have been frequently used to study senescence: fetal lung fibroblasts IMR-90, WI-38, and LF1 (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar) and foreskin fibroblasts HCA2. The corresponding lines (IMR90-TERT, WI-38-TERT, LF1-TERT, and HCA2-TERT) with telomerase activity were obtained from the parental lines by infection with a retroviral vector containing an hTERT expression cassette. Cells were grown for at least 70 population doublings after infection to confirm the immortalized phenotype. Telomerase activity in the immortalized lines was tested by the telomeric repeat amplification protocol assay (32Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. W. S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6539) Google Scholar). All the four immortalized lines had high telomerase activity (Fig.1). In order to induce premature senescence cells were treated with UV and γ-irradiation or H2O2. All these treatments have been reported to induce SIPS in human fibroblasts (7Toussaint O. Medrano E.E. von Zglinicki T. Exp. Gerontol. 2000; 35: 927-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). We have found that doses of 5.5 kilorads for γ-irradiation, 2 J/m2 for UV irradiation, and 500 μmH2O2 are optimal for induction of SIPS by testing a wide range of doses (data not shown). The above doses irreversibly arrest cell division in more than 90% of the surviving cells. Three days following the treatment, all cells acquired an enlarged flat morphology typical of senescent cells. No difference was observed between the corresponding cell lines with and without hTERT. To obtain a quantitative comparison of induction of SIPS, we used SA-β-gal staining and measured the number of cells that synthesized DNA by tritiated thymidine incorporation. All the treatments induced SA-β-gal activity in more than 70% of the cells (Fig.2 A). There was some variability between the individual cell lines but no difference between the normal and hTERT expressing cells of the same line. Thymidine incorporation was strongly inhibited in all the cell lines, independent of telomerase activity (Fig. 2 B). We then tested whether telomerase activity was still present after the stress treatments. To this end cells from two telomerase positive cell lines IMR-90+hTERT and LF1+hTERT were analyzed by TRAP assay (32Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R. Harley C.B. West M.D. Ho P.L. Coviello G.M. Wright W.E. Weinrich S.L. W. S.J. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6539) Google Scholar) 24 h after stress. The results (Fig.3) indicate that telomerase activity is slightly reduced following stress. This small change in telomerase activity cannot account for induction of senescence, because a high level of telomerase activity was still present in these cells. For example, the telomerase activity in γ-irradiated and H2O2-treated LF1+hTERT cells was as high as that in untreated IMR-90+hTERT cells. We also determined telomere length in IMR-90, IMR-90+hTERT, LF1, and LF1+hTERT cell lines by Southern blot analysis 10 days after stress treatments (Fig.4). All the cell lines had long telomeres characteristic of young cells, and importantly, no telomere shortening was observed in the cells undergoing SIPS compared with control cells, suggesting that SIPS was not caused by rapid telomere shortening.Figure 4Telomere length in normal and hTERT-immortalized fibroblast cell lines after stress treatments.Genomic DNA was extracted from cells 10 days after stress treatments and analyzed by Southern blot as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also compared the induction of p21 and the p53 and Rb status in the wild type and hTERT-expressing cells undergoing SIPS. Adherent cells were collected 48 h after treatment and analyzed by Western blot. p21 levels were elevated in all the cells undergoing SIPS (Fig.5 A), and there was no difference in the level of p21 induction between the parental and hTERT-expressing cell lines. Rb protein levels were decreased, and Rb was mainly in the unphosphorylated state in the cells treated with γ-irradiation and H2O2 (Fig. 5 B). Similar to results with p21 induction, there was no difference in the Rb status between the cells with or without telomerase. The level of p53 was strongly increased after UV treatment (Fig. 5 C), and a similar level of p53 induction was observed between the cells with or without telomerase. The level of p16 (Fig. 5 D) was not up-regulated in the cells undergoing SIPS. Our results demonstrate that there is no difference in the induction of SIPS between the cells with or without telomerase activity, as assayed by SA-β-gal staining, thymidine incorporation, and the expression pattern of the major proteins regulating cell cycle arrest. p21 plays a key role in the regulation of replicative senescence, and human fibroblasts with the knock out of p21 escape replicative senescence (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the role of p21 in SIPS, we examined the induction of SIPS in p21−/− human fibroblasts. We have used p21−/− cells that were derived from LF1 normal human fibroblasts by double knock out (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). LF1, LFp21−/−, and LF1p21−/−hTERT cells were subjected to UV, γ-irradiation, and H2O2 as described above. Following the various treatments, some of the p21−/− cells became enlarged and elongated but not as flattened as senescent wild type LF1 cells. Induction of SA-β-gal activity (Fig.6 A) and inhibition of DNA synthesis (Fig. 6 B) in p21−/− cells were also reduced ∼2-fold compared with the parental LF1 strain. H2O2 and γ-irradiation stress caused a decrease in levels of Rb in p21−/− cells, similar to that seen in wild type cells (Fig. 7 A). Therefore, p21−/− cells under stress displayed an intermediate phenotype with some but not all the features of senescent cells. The level of p16 protein was elevated in both treated and untreated p21−/− fibroblasts (Fig. 7 B), which has been observed previously (22Brown J.P. Wei W. Sedivy J.M. Science. 1997; 277: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 28Wei W. Hemmer R.M. Sedivy J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6748-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that p21 is involved in SIPS in human fibroblasts; however, it is not absolutely required, and there are alternative pathways for induction of SIPS.Figure 7Status of Rb and p16 in p21−/− human fibroblasts during stress-induced senescence. Cells were subjected to stress with 2 J/m2 UVB and 5.5 kilorads of γ-irradiation or treated with 500 mmH2O2 for 2 h. Adherent cells were collected 48 h after stress, and equal numbers of cells (105 for Rb and 5 × 105 for p16) were used for Western blot analysis with the antibodies against Rb (A) and p16 (B). The membranes were then hybridized with anti-actin antibodies (C) to demonstrate equal loading of samples.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although we did not detect any difference in the stress-induced senescence between wild type normal cells and cells with introduced telomerase, microscopic examination revealed some difference in survival following stress. Cells expressing hTERT showed better survival after treatment with UV and γ-irradiation. In order to determine what type of cell death is rescued by telomerase, we analyzed the induction of apoptosis and necrosis. Apoptosis and necrosis were assayed by acridine orange staining followed by FACS analysis (Figs.8 and 9). This method is very sensitive and allows one to differentiate between apoptosis and necrosis in the same sample (31Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Falcovitz A. Sigal A. Milyavsky M. Zurer I. Shohat G. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). In addition, induction of necrosis was confirmed by measuring the release of DNA into the media by necrotic cells (Fig.10).Figure 9Induction of apoptosis and necrosis in normal and hTERT-immortalized fibroblasts following stress. Cells were subjected to 2 J/m2 UVB (A) and 5.5 kilorads of γ-irradiation (B) or treated with 500 mmH2O2 for 2 h (C). 48 and 72 h after stress, the cells were stained with acridine orange and analyzed by FACS, which allowed the measurement of both apoptosis and necrosis. All the experiments were repeated at leas three times, and standard errors are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 10Induction of necrosis in normal and hTERT-immortalized fibroblast cell lines after stress treatments.Necrosis was analyzed by the release of DNA from necrotic cells into the medium, and DNA was quantified with a cellular DNA fragmentation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The percentage of DNA released from the total DNA is shown. Experiments were repeated three times, and S.D. values are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) UV irradiation induced primarily an apoptotic response (Fig.9 A), and a concomitant accumulation of p53 following treatment (Fig. 5 C). UV is known to be a strong inducer of apoptosis (31Seluanov A. Gorbunova V. Falcovitz A. Sigal A. Milyavsky M. Zurer I. Shohat G. Goldfinger N. Rotter V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1552-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Norbury C.J. Hickson I.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 367-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and we have here detected a low level of necrosis. Although there was a significant variation between the four cell types in their resistance to stress, and the ratio between apoptosis and necrosis, expression of hTERT reduced cell death, both apoptotic and necrotic, in all the cell lines. γ-Irradiation induced a very low level of apoptosis (Fig.9 B), consistent with a previous report (8Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar) on the lack of γ-irradiation-induced apoptosis in fibroblasts. The major type of cell death that we observed was necrosis (Figs. 9 C and 10). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of γ-irradiation-induced necrosis in fibroblasts. As was the case with UV treatment, cells containing telomerase activity were significantly more resistant to both types of cell death after γ-irradiation. Induction of necrosis was observed after H2O2treatment, with no difference between the cells with or without telomerase (Figs. 9 C and 10). The differences in resistance to H2O2 between the different cell lines had a pattern similar to UV resistance, with LF1 and HCA2 being more resistant to stress than WI-38 and IMR-90. Necrosis has been reported previously to occur at the higher doses of H2O2(more that 5 mm); however, our method of detection of necrosis is much more sensitive than the methods used in earlier studies (55Teramoto S.T.T. Matsui H. Ohga E. Matsuse T. Ouchi Y. Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 79: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In summary, telomerase activity protected cells from apoptosis and necrosis induced by UV and γ-irradiation but not by H2O2. We have demonstrated that expression of catalytically active telomerase does not prevent stress-induced senescence. This was observed in different cell lines of normal human fibroblasts following UV and γ-irradiation and H2O2 treatments. This allows us to rule out cell line-specific variations, which frequently cause discrepancies between different studies. Cells undergoing SIPS displayed the characteristics of replicative senescence such as SA-β-gal activity, lack of"

Although the two receptor subtypes share some signaling pathways, each has been shown to have specific signaling and regulatory properties. Given the recent recognition that many G protein-coupled receptors can form homo- and heterodimers, the present study was undertaken to determine whether the β1AR and β2AR can form dimers in cells and, if so, to investigate the potential functional consequences of such heterodimerization. Using co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer, we show that β1AR and β2AR can form heterodimers in HEK 293 cells co-expressing the two receptors. Functionally, β-adrenergic stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was found to be identical in cells expressing β1AR, β2AR, or both receptors at similar levels, indicating that heterodimerization did not affect this signaling pathway. When considering ERK1/2 MAPK activity, a significant agonist-promoted activation was detected in β2AR- but not β1AR-expressing cells. Similarly to what was observed in cells expressing the β1AR alone, no β-adrenergic stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation was observed in cells co-expressing the two receptors. A similar inhibition of agonist-promoted internalization of the β2AR was observed upon co-expression of the β1AR, which by itself internalized to a lesser extent. Taken together, our data suggest that heterodimerization between β1AR and β2AR inhibits the agonist-promoted internalization of the β2AR and its ability to activate the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (β1AR and β2AR) are co-expressed in numerous tissues where they play a central role in the responses of various organs to sympathetic stimulation.

In some of these cases, heterodimerization has been proposed to lead to receptors with pharmacological and/or functional properties that are different from those of the individual receptors. The potential regulatory influences that these oligomeric assemblies may have on the function of receptors co-existing in the same cell led us to investigate whether receptors that are ubiquitously expressed in many tissues and cell types could function as heterodimers. Two such widely distributed receptors are the β1AR and β2AR, which are co-expressed in a large number of tissues and cell types (20Brodde O.E. Karad K. Zerkowski H.R. Rohm N. Reidemeister J.C. Circ.

Although the two receptors are known to couple to Gsimportant differences in their functional properties have been reported. For instance, the β2AR has been shown to be more efficiently coupled than some variants of the β1AR to adenylyl cyclase (29Rousseau G. Nantel F. Bouvier M. Mol.

Also, β2AR activation leads to a more efficient stimulation of various MAPK signaling pathways (32Chesley A. Lundberg M.S. Asai T. Xiao R.P. Ohtani S. Lakatta E.G. Crow M.T. Circ.

In further contrast to the β2AR, which undergoes rapid internalization following agonist stimulation, the β1AR was found to remain largely localized at the cell surface for extended periods following agonist stimulation (34Suzuki T. Nguyen C.T. Nantel F. Bonin H. Valiquette M. Frielle T. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 542-548PubMed Google Scholar, 35Shiina T. Nagao T. Kurose H.

Since these differences represent intrinsic properties that were determined for the individual receptors, they offer useful readouts to assess the functional consequences of heterodimerization. In the present study, the occurrence of heterodimerization between the β1AR and β2AR was assessed by co-immunoprecipitation and bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) in living human cells co-expressing the two receptors. The potential functional consequences of the heterodimerization were also assessed by determining the influence of receptor co-expression on the ability of the receptors to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and MAPK pathways as well as to undergo agonist-promoted internalization. We found that co-expression of the two receptor subtypes in HEK 293 cells lead to their heterodimerization and inhibited both agonist-promoted β2AR internalization and ERK1/2 MAPK stimulation. This suggests that heterodimerization may represent a regulatory cross-talk process arising through the creation of a receptor form that has distinct functional properties. Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals were of reagent grade or higher and were obtained from Sigma. The β1AR coding sequence without its stop codon was amplified from the pBC12BI-human β1AR plasmid (28Frielle T. Collins S. Daniel K.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7920-7924Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar) using sense and antisense primers harboring unique SacI and AgeI sites. The fragment was then subcloned in frame into theSacI/AgeI site of the turquoise variant GFP-Sapphire vector (pGFP-N1-Sapphire; Packard Instrument Co.) to give the plasmid pGFP-N1-β1AR-Sapphire. Finally, the GFP-Sapphire was replaced by a green GFP variant (GFP10) containing the following mutations: P64L, S147P, and S202P. For this purpose, an AgeI/BsrGI fragment of the GFP10 was subcloned into the AgeI/BsrGI site of the pGFP-N1-β1AR-Sapphire to finally yield pGFP-N1-β1AR-GFP10. The GFP10AgeI/BsrGI fragment was subcloned into theAgeI/BsrGI site of pGFP-N1-Hisβ2AR-YFP (26Angers S. Salahpour A. Joly E. Hilairet S. Chelsky D. Dennis M. Bouvier M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3684-3689PubMed Google Scholar). For the sake of simplicity, the constructs are referred to as β1AR-GFP and β2AR-GFP, respectively. TheHindIII/XhoI fragment of the plasmid pCMV-HA-β1AR, which was a generous gift of Dr. Brian Kobilka (Stanford University) (37Rohrer D.K. Desai K.H. Jasper J.R. Stevens M.E. Regula Jr., D.P. Barsh G.S. Bernstein D. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7375-7380Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), was subcloned into theHindIII/XhoI site of pcDNA3 (RSV) plasmid to yield pcDNA3 (RSV)-HA-β1AR. This β1AR construct contains an arginine at position 389, the most common polymorphism at this position (38Mason D.A. Moore J.D. Green S.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The human Hisβ2AR coding sequence was amplified using a sense primer containing aBamHI restriction site followed by the HA tag sequence and an antisense primer. The amplified HA-β2AR sequence was digested with BamHI/EcoNI and then subcloned intoBamHI/EcoNI-digested pcDNA3 (RSV)-His-β2AR vector, resulting in pcDNA3 (RSV)-HisHA-β2AR plasmid. The pcDNA3.1-β1AR:6:hRluc was a generous gift from BioSignal Packard Bioscience. This fusion protein contains a linker of 6 amino acids linking the carboxyl tail of the human β1AR to humanized Rluc. The humanized Rluc coding sequence (Packard Instrument Co.) was amplified using sense and antisense primers and then subcloned into the PCR Blunt II Topo vector (Invitrogen). The hRluc fragment was excised by digestion with KpnI/XbaI and subcloned into the KpnI/XbaI-digested pcDNA3.1 Zeo vector to generate the pcDNA3.1 Zeo/hRluc plasmid. The human Hisβ2AR coding sequence was amplified without its stop codon using sense and antisense primers. The PCR product was subcloned into PCR Blunt II Topo Vector and then excised by double digestion with HindIII/KpnI and ligated into theHindIII/KpnI-digested expression vector pcDNA3.1Zeo/hRluc. The resulting construct encodes a 6-amino acid linker between the carboxyl tail of the β2AR and the humanized Rluc sequence. In some experiments, a c-myc-tagged version (N-terminal) of the β2AR-Rluc construct was used. The pcDNA3.1-HA-GABABR2 was a generous gift from GlaxoSmithKline. HEK 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Wisent or BioMedia), 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine (from Wisent or Invitrogen). For transfection experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/100-mm dish and cultured for 24 h. Transient transfections were then performed using either the calcium phosphate precipitation protocol (39Mellon P. Parker V. Gluzman Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1981; 27: 279-288Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The cells were then cultured in the same medium for 48–72 h. In some experiments, transient transfections were carried out in HEK 293 cells stably expressing the human β2AR (a generous gift from Dr. Phil Wedergaertner, Thomas Jefferson University). For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells co-expressing HA-tagged receptors and the β2AR-GFP were harvested 72 h post-transfection, washed three times in PBS, and incubated with blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h on ice. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with the mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody (1:250 dilution) in blocking buffer on ice for an additional 1 h. After two washes in blocking buffer and two washes in PBS, cells were lysed, and proteins were solubilized in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmiodoacetamide, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml benzamidine, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin for 30 min on ice and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. For immunoprecipitation of the total receptor pool, lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with additional 12CA5 antibodies (1:200 dilution) before the addition of protein G-Sepharose for 3 h. For immunoprecipitation of cell surface receptors, only protein G-Sepharose was added. Protein G-Sepharose-antibody-antigen complexes were then collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. The immunoprecipitates were washed four times with cold radioimmune precipitation buffer and resuspended in sample buffer containing 60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 4 m urea, and 100 mmdithiothreitol and heated at 50 °C. Protein concentration to be used in the immunoprecipitation was assessed using the DC Protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein samples were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose (Protran), and subjected to immunoblotting using rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH, 1:100 dilution). The Renaissance chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for Western blot development. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were washed twice in PBS, detached with PBS/EDTA, and resuspended in PBS plus 0.1% glucose. Cells were then distributed in 96-well microplates (white Optiplate from BioSignal Packard Bioscience) at a density of ∼100,000 cells/well. Deep Blue C coelenterazine (BioSignal Packard Bioscience) was added at a final concentration of 5 μm, and readings were collected using a modified Top-count apparatus (BRETCount) that allows the sequential integration of the signals detected in the 370–450- and 500–530-nm windows using filters with the appropriate band pass (Chroma). The BRET signal is determined by calculating the ratio of the light emitted by the receptor-GFP (500–530 nm) over the light emitted by the receptor-Rluc (370–450 nm). The values were corrected by subtracting the background signal detected when the Receptor-Rluc constructs were expressed alone. On a routine basis, the protein concentration of the samples was determined to control for the number of cells using a Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine the maximal BRET level detectable between each partner, preliminary experiments were carried out by co-transfecting increasing amounts of the receptor-GFP plasmids with a constant quantity of receptor-Rluc construct. Membranes were prepared from cells 48 h after transfection as described previously (25Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16384-16392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 40Lemire I. Allen B.G. Rindt H. Hebert T.E. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1998; 30: 1827-1839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS. They were then disrupted by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer in 10 ml of ice-cold buffer containing 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm EDTA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml benzamidine, and 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 45,000 × g for 20 min, and the pellet was washed twice in the same buffer. Membrane preparations were used immediately for adenylyl cyclase and binding assays. Membranes were prepared and washed as described above. Total βAR number was calculated from binding experiments using a saturating concentration (300 pm) of [125I]cyanopindolol (CYP; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as the radioligand. Briefly, membrane preparations (10 μg of protein) were incubated with [125I]CYP for 90 min at room temperature in a total volume of 0.5 ml in the presence or absence of 10 μmalprenolol or propranolol (Sigma) to define specific binding. In some experiments, the proportion of β1AR and β2AR expressed were determined using a concentration (0.1 μm) of the selective β2- or β1-specific antagonists ICI 118,551 (Tocris) or betaxolol (Tocris) that fully occupies one of the subtypes but blocks less than 10% of the other. Surface receptor expression was determined using whole cell binding assays with the hydrophilic ligand [3H]CGP 12177 (CGP; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described (41Dunigan C.D. Curran P.K. Fishman P.H. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 126: 329-343PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were transiently transfected with either β2AR-GFP10 or β2AR-GFP10 and HA-β1AR. Briefly, β2AR-specific internalization was determined using 5 × 10−8m betaxolol to block CGP binding to the β1AR, and nonspecific surface binding was determined using 10 μm propranolol and subtracted from values determined in the presence of betaxolol. These experiments (except for washing steps) were conducted at 37 °C. Cells were treated with 10 μm isoproterenol or vehicle (10−4m ascorbic acid) for 2 h and then washed with cold PBS to remove ligand. For cell surface binding, cells were incubated with CGP for 30 min, and for total binding, cells were incubated with CYP for 60 min. Cells were then filtered with a Brandel cell harvester as for the membrane receptor assay described above. Adenylyl cyclase activity was assayed in the same membrane preparation according to the method of Salomon et al. (42Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) using 50 μg of protein in a total volume of 50 μl. Enzyme activities were determined following a 15-min incubation in the presence of 1 nm to 100 μm isoproterenol, 100 μm forskolin, 10 mm NaF, or the vehicle at 37 °C. Data were calculated as pmol of cAMP produced/min/mg of protein, normalized with respect to forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and analyzed by least squares regression using GraphPad PRISM. Cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated for the indicated times with the nonselective β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate at 37 °C. Cells were then lysed in a buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 10% glycerol (v/v), 25 mm NaF, 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmbenzamidine, 0.5 μm microcystin, 1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. The samples were then prepared for denaturing SDS-PAGE, and the activity of the p38 and p42/p44 (ERK1/2) MAPK was determined by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38 or anti-phospho-ERK (both at 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling). The blots were then stripped and reblotted with the anti-ERK1/2 or anti-p38 (1:2000; StressGen) to control for the total amount of kinases loaded. Data from separate experiments were digitized on a flatbed scanner and analyzed using Quantity One (Bio-Rad) software. Cells were cultured on coverslips overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and stimulated for the indicated times with 1 μm isoproterenol at 37 °C. They were then permeabilized and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (v/v) and 0.2% Triton X-100 (v/v) for 20 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, the cells were treated with a blocking solution containing 2% BSA and 5% preimmune normal donkey serum (Jackson Laboratories) for 1 h. Rabbit polyclonal anti-β2AR (1:100 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-β1AR (a generous gift from Dr. Brian Kobilka, Stanford University; 1:100 dilution), diluted in a solution of 2.5% normal donkey serum and 1% BSA, were subsequently incubated with fixed, permeabilized cells for 16 h at 4 °C. Following three washes with PBS, CY5-labeled secondary donkey anti-rabbit antiserum (1:500 dilution; Jackson Laboratories) was incubated with the samples for 60 min in the dark followed again by three washes with PBS. For colocalization experiments, cells were transfected with β2AR-GFP and β1AR. GFP fluorescence was stimulated with a 488-nm argon laser, and these signals were overlaid with CY5 fluorescence (stimulated with a 633-nm helium-neon laser) after labeling with anti-β1AR. Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM-510 system with a highly corrected objective (Zeiss Plan-Apochromat ×63, numerical aperture 1.4 under oil). Control experiments were performed in the absence of primary antibodies and revealed a low level of background staining, indicating the specificity of the primary antibodies used. Cells were transfected with β2AR-Rluc bearing a c-myc tag on the extracellular N terminus alone or with β1AR-GFP10 and transferred to six-well polylysine-coated plates 12 h after transfection. 24 h post-transfection, cells were treated with 10 μmisoproterenol or vehicle for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were kept on ice for all subsequent steps. After three washes with cold PBS, cells were blocked with PBS with 1% BSA (w/v) for 30 min. Blocked cells were then incubated with anti-myc (9E10) antibodies (1:500 dilution) for 60 min and subsequently washed again three times with PBS plus 1% BSA. Cells were then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (v/v) for 15 min and washed three times with PBS. Cells were blocked again for 15 min with PBS plus 1% BSA, incubated with anti-mouse/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences; 1:1000) for 30 min, and finally washed with PBS plus 1% BSA three times. The substrateo-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions for 4–7 min. The reaction was stopped with 200 μl of 3 n HCl, and extinction was measured at 492 nm. Data were plotted as percentage of signal (isoproterenol) relative to time-matched control (vehicle). In a first attempt to determine whether the β2AR could form a heterodimer with the β1AR, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment between β1AR and β2AR bearing different epitope tags (HA and GFP, respectively) was designed. The ability of the β2AR to form homodimers or to heterodimerize with the β1AR was assessed in HEK 293 cells co-expressing the β2AR-GFP with either HA-β2AR or HA-β1AR (Fig. 1,lanes 3–6). After cell surface (S) or total cell extract (T) immunoprecipitation of the HA-tagged receptors using a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody, the presence of β2AR-GFP in the immunoprecipitate was probed using a rabbit anti-GFP antibody. Two major species corresponding to monomeric and oligomeric forms of the β2AR were detected in both HA-β2AR/β2AR-GFP- and HA-β1AR/β2AR-GFP-expressing cells. In contrast, no specific GFP immunoreactivity was detected at the cell surface or in the total extract of cells co-expressing the unrelated HA-tagged GABAB-R2 receptor and the β2AR-GFP (Fig. 1, lanes 7 and 8), confirming the selectivity of the immunoprecipitation approach. Immunoreactivity for the HA-GABAB-R2 was, however, detected in the anti-HA immunoprecipitate (data not shown), confirming that this receptor was efficiently expressed and immunoprecipitated. Taken together, these results confirm, as previously reported (25Hebert T.E. Moffett S. Morello J.P. Loisel T.P. Bichet D.G. Barret C. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

The higher molecular weight species detected in Western analyses correspond to SDS-resistant complexes that may either represent dimers or possibly higher order oligomers such as trimers that were not fully denatured by SDS (25Hebert T.E.

Such molecules are indispensable structural components for the survival of microorganisms, and their presence in large numbers makes them ideal targets for recognition by innate immune systems, which utilize limited numbers of germ line-encoded proteins. The target molecules, represented by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 and peptidoglycan (PGN) on Gram-negative and -positive bacteria, are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) (1Medzhitov R.

Despite the intensive investigation of the responses to bacteria, much less is known about the responses to fungi, another important pathogen for multicellular organisms. The phagocytic responses and subsequent inflammatory reactions of macrophages to zymosan, a yeast cell wall component, indicate that the mammalian innate immune system has the capacity to respond to fungi (10Speert D.P. Silverstein S.C. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1985; 38: 655-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). However, identification of PAMPs on fungi remains elusive because zymosan is a crude mixture of glucans, mannan, proteins, chitin, and glycolipids (11Di Carlo F.J. Fiore J.V. Science. 1958; 127: 756-757Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Among the fungal cell wall components, glucans with (1→3)-β-glucosidic linkages, (1→3)-β-d-glucans, are most abundantly present and provide mechanical strength to the cell walls (12Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. Chemistry and Biology of (1→3)-β-Glucans. La Trobe University Press, Victoria, Australia1992Google Scholar). In addition to fungi, (1→3)-β-d-glucans are widely distributed in algae and higher plants, but rarely found in animals (12Stone B.A. Clarke A.E. Chemistry and Biology of (1→3)-β-Glucans. La Trobe University Press, Victoria, Australia1992Google Scholar). In invertebrates, (1→3)-β-d-glucans are known to be potent stimulators for the innate immune system. In horseshoe crabs, factor G, a (1→3)-β-d-glucan-sensitive serine protease, is activated by the glucan to induce hemolymph coagulation (13Seki N. Muta T. Oda T. Iwaki D. Kuma K. Miyata T. Iwanaga S.

Immunol. 1998; 10: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). In plants, (1→3)-β-d-glucans are one of the elicitors to induce phytoalexin production (19Sharp J.K. Valent B. Albersheim P. J.

In mammals, (1→3)-β-d-glucans are known to be potent activators of the complement system (21Glovsky M.M. Cortes-Haendchen L. Ghekiere L. Alenty A. Williams D.L. Di Luzio R. J. Reticuloendothel. Soc. 1983; 33: 401-413PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous reports indicate that (1→3)-β-d-glucans exert inhibitory activities against tumor growth (22Chihara G. Maeda Y. Hamuro J. Sasaki T. Fukuoka F. Nature. 1969; 222: 687-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 23Sasaki T. Abiko N. Sugino Y. Nitta K. Cancer Res. 1978; 38: 379-383PubMed Google Scholar, 24Stiteler R.D.

Immunopharmacol. 1999; 42: 61-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), in addition to exhibiting anti-inflammatory activities (26Zelenski S.G. Worthen L.R. Bot. Mar. 1974; 17: 191-195Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 27Kiho T. Sakai M. Ukai S. Hara C. Tanaka Y. Carbohydr. Res. 1985; 142: 344-351Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because these activities are considered to be expressed through the stimulation of the reticulo-endothelial system, including stimulation of macrophages, endothelial, and reticulum cells, (1→3)-β-d-glucans are known as biological response modifiers (BRMs). In contrast to these activities observed in vivo, however, relatively little is known about the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucansin vitro, and hence the molecular mechanisms of the cellular activation by (1→3)-β-d-glucans are poorly understood. Although some reports have described that (1→3)-β-d-glucans elicit the production of cytokines and nitric oxide (28Hashimoto T. Ohno N. Adachi Y. Yadomae T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Soltys J. Quinn M.T. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 244-252Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vassallo R. Standing J.E. Limper A.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 3755-3763Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), the relationships between the structures of the glucans and their stimulatory activities are still controversial due to a lack of reproducible in vitro systems to evaluate the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucans. In the present study, we evaluate the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucans with a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) reporter system constructed with macrophages. This reliable and reproducible in vitro system allows characterization of the responses of macrophages to (1→3)-β-d-glucans. The results obtained indicate that the linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan curdlan exhibits significant cell-stimulating activities, and that the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucans are dependent on their lengths and conformations. Furthermore, the analysis of the intracellular signaling suggests the involvement of MyD88, and therefore of a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor-like (TIR) domain-containing receptor(s), in the responses to (1→3)-β-d-glucans. Curdlan, LPS from Escherichia coli0111:B4, PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, and laminarin fromLaminaria digitata were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), List Biological Laboratories, Inc. (Campbell, CA), Fluka Chemika-Biochemika (Buchs, Switzerland), and Sigma Chemical Co., respectively. Polymyxin B sulfate, poly(I)·poly(C), and mouse interferon-γ were from Sigma, AmershamBiosciences, and Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA), respectively, and laminarioligosaccharides and zymolyase were from Seikagaku Corp. (Tokyo, Japan). LPS concentration in curdlan was measured by means of an LPS-specific Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test using an Endospecy kit (Seikagaku Corp.). Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a GST fusion protein with the xylanase Z-like domain of the horseshoe crab factor G were prepared as described previously (15Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). An expression plasmid for a dominant-negative mutant for MyD88 (pcDNA3-hMyD88C) was constructed by inserting a cDNA fragment for human MyD88 (amino acid 155 to the COOH terminus) created by a polymerase chain reaction into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). pELAM1-Luc (31Muta T. Takeshige K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4580-4589Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and pRL-TK (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) were used as an NF-κB reporter plasmid and an internal control plasmid, respectively. RAW264.7 and RAW-R12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. RAW-R12 cells were obtained by stably transfecting pELAM-1-Luc into RAW264.7 cells. RAW-R12 cells (1 × 105 cells/well), stably transfected with the NF-κB reporter plasmid pELAM1-Luc, were seeded in a 96-well plate on the day before stimulation. The cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed, and their luciferase activities were measured by using a luciferase assay system (Promega Corp.). RAW264.7 cells (5× 105 cells/well) in a 24-well plate were transfected with an expression plasmid together with an NF-κB reporter, pELAM1-Luc, and a control Renilla luciferase reporter, pRL-TK, using FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Diagnostics). The cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed, and their luciferase activities were measured by using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega Corp.). The NF-κB reporter activity was divided by the activity of the Renillacontrol reporter to normalize transfection efficiency. Cells were stimulated as indicated and lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15m NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, and 0.2 mmNa3VO4, supplemented with Complete™ protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics) on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation, the cell lysate was immunoblotted with anti-inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). TNF-α secreted from stimulated cells into culture medium was assayed by bioassay using L929 cells (32Kiemer A.K. Hartung T. Vollmar A.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The standard curve was obtained with recombinant mouse TNF-α (Genzyme Techne). It was confirmed that more than 95% of TNF-α activities in the sample were neutralized with anti-mouse TNF-α monoclonal antibody (Genzyme Techne). After RAW264.7 cells were stimulated, total RNA was extracted from the cells by using TRIzol™ (Invitrogen Life Technologies). 10 μg of RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond™-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized with a32P-labeled probe for iNOS, TNF-α, or macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2). As a loading control, the same blot was hybridized with a probe for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To evaluate the activity of (1→3)-β-d-glucans on the mammalian cells, we assessed NF-κB activation in macrophages, which is one of the prominent responses of the mammalian innate immune system. Among various (1→3)-β-d-glucan preparations examined, curdlan, a linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan derived from Alcaligenes faecalis var. myxogenes 10C3K (33Harada T. Misaki A. Saito H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1968; 124: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), at final concentrations of 10–100 μg/ml, induced robust activation of NF-κB in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7, which was stably transfected with an NF-κB reporter plasmid (RAW-R12) (Fig.1 A). Because curdlan is insoluble at neutral pH, it was once solubilized in NaOH solution and then added to the culture medium to neutralize pH by diluting 100-fold. The NaOH-pretreated curdlan was added to the cells for stimulation immediately after the neutralization. When the contamination of the curdlan preparation with LPS, a strong activator of macrophages, was measured by the LPS-specific Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) test, it was revealed that <1 pg of LPS was present per microgram of curdlan (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that the NF-κB-stimulating activity was due to contaminating LPS, the cells were stimulated in the presence of polymyxin B, which neutralizes the LPS activity (34Storm D.R. Rosenthal K.S. Swanson P.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 723-763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polymyxin B effectively inhibited the activity of 100 ng/ml LPS (Fig. 1 B), but not the activity of curdlan (Fig. 1 A). In all of the following experiments, stimulation by curdlan was done in the presence of polymyxin B. We carefully titrated the concentrations of NaOH used for solubilizing curdlan (Fig. 2 A). Curdlan was solubilized with NaOH at the indicated concentrations, then diluted 100-fold with the medium and used to stimulate the cells. NaOH alone at 0.01–0.3 m did not stimulate the NF-κB activity (data not shown). Insoluble curdlan suspension in water (0 mNaOH) showed weak activity, and this activity was significantly augmented by increasing the concentrations of NaOH. The addition of 0.15 m NaOH to the medium raised the pH of the medium by 0.2–0.3 units, but the viability of the cells did not change during the assay (data not shown). Although the activity was reduced with 0.3m NaOH, this reduction was most likely caused by the toxic effects of the increased pH of the medium on the cells: when NaOH-pretreated curdlan was diluted 1,000-fold with the medium, the NF-κB-stimulating activity of curdlan pretreated with 0.3m NaOH was higher than that of curdlan pretreated with 0.15m NaOH (data not shown). When LPS was similarly treated with NaOH, its ability to activate the NF-κB of macrophages was gradually reduced by increasing concentrations of NaOH (Fig.2 B). The NF-κB-stimulating activity of PGN, which is insoluble even in the NaOH solutions, was scarcely affected by NaOH, but was also inhibited at higher NaOH concentrations (Fig.2 C). When KOH was used instead of NaOH, similar augmentation of the curdlan activity and inhibition of the LPS and PGN activities were observed (data not shown). We also found that another preparation of a linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan, paramylon, activated the cells to a lesser degree, and in an NaOH-dependent manner like that of curdlan (data not shown). Curdlan solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) also exhibited the enhanced activity as in NaOH (Fig. 2 D). We next tried to activate the insoluble curdlan without the pretreatment with NaOH or Me2SO, since these compounds do not occur under physiological conditions. We tested the effect of treatment with zymolyase, an endoglucosidase, which partially solubilizes curdlan. Zymolyase treatment for 15–30 min markedly stimulated the activity of curdlan (Fig.3 A). Longer treatment with zymolyase failed to completely solubilize curdlan, the activity of which was slightly reduced at 60 min and sustained up to 24 h. The effect of zymolyase treatment was specific to curdlan, because zymolyase itself did not activate NF-κB in the absence of curdlan (data not shown), and the enzyme treatment did not affect the activity of LPS (Fig. 3 B). When the zymolyase-treated curdlan was centrifuged, the activity was found in the insoluble fraction, and the soluble fraction showed little activity (Fig. 3 C). Zymolyase treatment of paramylon for 15 min also enhanced its NF-κB-stimulating activity, which was gradually decreased by longer treatment with zymolyase (data not shown). Because the NaOH and zymolyase treatments convert curdlan from insoluble particulates to soluble glucans, it is possible that these treatments release unknown contaminants in the particulates that activate macrophages. We attempted to determine if the macrophage-stimulating activity is due to (1→3)-β-d-glucan itself by using a (1→3)-β-d-glucan-binding protein. The COOH-terminal xylanase Z-like domain of the (1→3)-β-d-glucan-sensitive horseshoe crab factor G binds specifically to a (1→3)-β-d-glucan disaccharide at a K a of 5.77 × 107m−1 and neutralizes the activity of (1→3)-β-d-glucan to activate factor G (15Takaki Y. Seki N. Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We utilized this glucan-binding domain (GBD) of the horseshoe crab factor G to examine the specificity of the activity of curdlan. When preincubated with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein containing GBD (GST-GBD), the activity of NaOH-pretreated curdlan was dose-dependently inhibited (Fig.4 A). The inhibition was not observed with GST. In contrast to the effect on curdlan, the activity of LPS was not affected either by GST-GBD or GST (Fig. 4 B). Neither GST nor GST-GBD activated NF-κB in the absence of curdlan (data not shown). Thus, it was confirmed that the activity of curdlan was indeed due to the authentic (1→3)-β-d-glucan. Because curdlan is a long (1→3)-β-d-glucan with a degree of polymerization (DP) of ∼500, we next investigated the activities of short (1→3)-β-d-glucans. When the activities of laminarioligosaccharides, linear water-soluble (1→3)-β-d-glucans with a DP of 2–7, were examined by using RAW-R12 cells, none of them exhibited the stimulating activity at concentrations up to 1 mg/ml even after the NaOH pretreatment (data not shown). Instead, laminarioheptaose (DP = 7) inhibited the curdlan-mediated activation in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5 A). Laminarioheptaose did not inhibit LPS-mediated activation, however (Figs. 5 Band D). When laminarioligosaccharides with different lengths were examined, the inhibition was dependent on the DP of the oligosaccharides, with the longer oligosaccharides exhibiting the greater inhibition (Fig. 5 C). We further examined the activity of laminarin derived from L. digitata, which is a water-soluble (1→3)-β-d-glucan preparation with a DP of 20–30, and with branches of single glucosyl residues by a (1→6)-β-linkage (35Read S.M. Currie G. Bacic A. Carbohydr. Res. 1996; 281: 187-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Laminarin exhibited a weak stimulating activity at 1–5 mg/ml. Nevertheless, it dose-dependently inhibited the curdlan-mediated activation without affecting the LPS-mediated activation (Fig. 5, E andF). We next investigated whether the stimulation of macrophages with curdlan leads to inflammatory reactions. We treated thioglycolate-elicited peritoneal macrophages with curdlan or LPS and examined the induction of iNOS by Western blotting. 16 h after stimulation with curdlan, a significant induction of iNOS was observed (Fig.6 A). Like the induction by LPS, the induction by curdlan was considerably enhanced by co-stimulation with interferon-γ. Polymyxin B inhibited the induction by LPS but not that by curdlan. The induction of iNOS was also observed in bone marrow-derived macrophages (data not shown) and RAW264.7 cells (Fig. 6 B) by the treatment with curdlan alone. When the time course of the iNOS induction was examined, the induction by curdlan was much slower than that by LPS (Fig. 6 B). We also measured the TNF-α production in the cells stimulated by curdlan or LPS. In contrast to the induction of iNOS, curdlan alone induced TNF-α secretion comparable to that by LPS with a similar time course (Fig.6 C). When the effect of the NaOH pretreatment on the iNOS induction was examined, the induction was found to be dependent on the concentrations of NaOH: the maximum induction was observed when curdlan was pretreated with 0.15 m NaOH (Fig. 6 D). The activity of LPS was reduced by higher concentrations of NaOH and that of PGN was less affected. These results coincide well with the effect of NaOH on the NF-κB activation. To determine whether the inductions by curdlan occur at the mRNA level, we analyzed changes of mRNAs for iNOS and TNF-α after the stimulation (Fig. 7). The induction of iNOS mRNA by curdlan was slower and much weaker compared with that by LPS. On the other hand, the curdlan-stimulated cells exhibited a rapid and strong induction of TNF-α mRNA, which was comparable to that of the LPS-stimulated cells. These results are consistent with the pattern of the protein expression shown in Fig. 6. We also found that mRNA for macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, another inflammatory mediator, was also induced by curdlan as strongly as by LPS. In contrast to mRNA for iNOS or TNF-α, the MIP-2 mRNA decayed faster in curdlan-stimulated cells than in LPS-stimulated cells. Curdlan stimulation of macrophages culminates in the production of inflammatory mediators that are also produced by LPS- or PGN-stimulation, whose signaling is transduced into the cells through TLR4 or TLR2, respectively (4Poltorak A., He, X.

Muta, unpublished data. we suspected that curdlan might activate other TLRs. All the TLRs thus far identified utilize the adaptor protein MyD88. The truncated mutant of MyD88 harboring the COOH-terminal region interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of TLRs and hence acts as a dominant-negative mutant (38Muzio M., Ni, J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar, 39Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W., Li, S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We used this mutant to determine whether curdlan-mediated signaling is also mediated by MyD88. When the activation of NF-κB was evaluated on vector- or the MyD88 mutant-transfected RAW264.7 cells, the curdlan-mediated activation was significantly inhibited in the mutant-transfected cells, as were the LPS- and PGN-mediated activations (Fig. 8). On the other hand, transfection of the MyD88 mutant was ineffective in inhibiting the activation by the double-stranded RNA poly(I)·poly(C), as shown in previous reports (40Häcker H. Vabulas R.M. Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. Wagner H. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 192: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 41Vabulas R.M. Ahmad-Nejad P. da Costa C. Miethke T. Kirschning C.J. Häcker H.

The results indicate that curdlan-mediated signaling is also mediated through the MyD88-dependent pathway. After screening of various (1→3)-β-d-glucans by measuring NF-κB-activating activity in macrophages, we identified curdlan, a linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan, as the strongest activator. The glucans screened by the current system included branched (1→3)-β-d-glucans such as laminarin, paramylon, schizophyllan, lentinan, bakers' yeast β-glucan, barley β-glucan, and krestin. Although schizophyllan, lentinan, and krestin are known as BRM and have been reported to induce the production of nitric oxide and/or TNF-α in macrophages (28Hashimoto T. Ohno N. Adachi Y. Yadomae T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 1006-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 42Kerékgyártó C. Virág L. Tankó L. Chihara G. Fachet J. Int. J.

Immunother. 1996; 42: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), by our present assay system we could not detect significant NF-κB-stimulating activities of these branched (1→3)-β-d-glucans at concentrations of 100 μg/ml with or without NaOH pretreatment. Instead, another linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan, paramylon, activated NF-κB after the pretreatment with NaOH, but to a much lesser extent than curdlan. Various microbe-derived molecules have been reported to activate innate immunity via respective specific TLRs (2Aderem A. Ulevitch R.J. Nature. 2000; 406: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2610) Google Scholar). We carefully examined the possibility that this activity was due to a trace amount of contaminants derived from microbes in the curdlan preparation. Based on the following observations, we concluded that the activity of curdlan shown in the present study was due to the authentic (1→3)-β-d-glucan. The activity of curdlan was not affected by polymyxin B, which neutralized 100 ng/ml LPS effectively (Fig. 1). The activity of curdlan was dependent on the pretreatment with NaOH, whereas those of LPS and PGN were not affected or reduced by the pretreatment (Fig. 2). Furthermore, TLR2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, or 9-transfected HEK293 cells, which are responsive to PGN/lipopeptides, double-stranded RNA, LPS, flagellin, or CpG DNA, respectively (7Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T.

GBD of the horseshoe crab factor G, which specifically binds to (1→3)-β-d-glucosidic linkages, inhibited the activity of curdlan but not that of LPS (Fig. 4). The modulatory effects of short (1→3)-β-d-glucans and zymolyase, an endo-(1→3)-β-d-glucosidase, on the activity of curdlan further supported the conclusion. Since this was the first careful examination of such contaminants, and since our results showed that some preparations of β-glucans contained polymyxin B-inhibitable activities (data not shown), a portion of the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucans or their derivatives described in previous reports might be attributable to the contaminant(s) that stimulates macrophages. Zymosan, which consists of yeast cell wall particles, is one of the strong macrophage activators containing (1→3)-β-d-glucans. In contrast to curdlan, zymosan activated TLR2-transfected HEK293 cells, and the activation of macrophages by zymosan was only weakly inhibited by the short (1→3)-β-d-glucans or GBD (data not shown). Thus, zymosan should contain multiple stimulators for macrophages in addition to (1→3)-β-d-glucans, and hence it is not an ideal material to study the activities of (1→3)-β-d-glucans. The activity of curdlan was dramatically enhanced by the pretreatment with NaOH (Figs. 2 and 6 D). Long gel-forming (1→3)-β-d-glucans are basically composed of a single helix in water, and the single helices of these molecules associate to form local junction zones composed of double- or triple-stranded helices, which are connected by the single helices to form networks (46Saito H. Miyata E. Sasaki T. Macromolecules. 1978; 11: 1244-1251Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The addition of NaOH up to 0.19 m gradually breaks the multiple-helical structures without changing the single helical conformation. At NaOH concentrations between 0.19 and 0.22m, a transition occurs from the single helix to random structures (47Saito H. Ohki T. Sasaki T. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 48Ogawa K. Watanabe T. Tsurugi J. Sozaburo O. Carbohydr. Res. 1972; 23: 399-405Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with Me2SO, which converts the conformation of curdlan to random structures (49Casu B. Reggiani M. Tetrahedron. 1966; 22: 3061-3083Crossref Scopus (227) Google Scholar), also activated curdlan (Fig. 2 D). The augmentation of the activity of curdlan by pretreatment with NaOH or Me2SO indicates that the single helix and random structures are active conformations for the stimulation of NF-κB in macrophages. It has been reported that the horseshoe crab factor G is also activated by (1→3)-β-d-glucans with the single helical and random structures, but not by those with triple-stranded helices (50Ohno N. Emori Y. Yadomae T. Saito K. Masuda A. Oikawa S. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 207: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The zymolyase treatment, which is unlikely to change the conformation of curdlan, would release the single helices from the network of curdlan, since the enzyme is an endoglucanase that cleaves the single helices but not the multiple helices (51Catley B.J. Fraser M.E. Carbohydr. Res. 1988; 183: 83-88Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar). The observation that the zymolyase treatment stimulated the activity of curdlan indicates that the molecular flexibility of the single helix, which is fixed by the multiple-stranded helices, is important for the activity of curdlan. Solubility seems not to be important for the activity of (1→3)-β-d-glucans, because even after the zymolyase treatment, the active fraction was in the insoluble fraction but not in the soluble fraction (Fig. 3 D). Carboxymethylated curdlan is soluble in water, but inactive in our assay system (data not shown). The activity of curdlan to stimulate NF-κB was inhibited by transfection of a MyD88 dominant-negative mutant containing the COOH-terminal TIR domain (Fig. 8). MyD88 acts as an essential adaptor protein proximal to interleukin-1 receptor and TLRs by associating the receptors through their TIR domains. Therefore, the inhibition by the MyD88 mutant strongly suggests that the signal transduction induced by (1→3)-β-d-glucans is mediated through a member(s) of the TLR family. Although several membrane components, such as complement receptor 3 (52Thornton B.P. Větvička V. Pitman M. Goldman R.C. Ross G.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 1235-1246PubMed Google Scholar), a scavenger receptor (53Pearson A. Lux A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

They might function as phagocytic receptors, although their significance in the activation of macrophages is unknown. The identification of the responsible TIR-containing receptor(s) for curdlan remains to be determined. The qualitatively different induction patterns of iNOS, TNF-α, and MIP-2 by curdlan (Figs. 6 and 7) suggest that the receptor for curdlan is distinct from that for LPS or PGN. As in the cases of most PAMPs that stimulate TLRs, it is currently unknown whether or not curdlan directly binds to a cell surface receptor. Our characterization of curdlan-mediated activation of macrophages, however, provided some insight into the nature of the curdlan-recognizing protein. Water-soluble short linear (1→3)-β-d-glucan oligosaccharides with a DP of <7 did not activate macrophages at all; in fact, they inhibited the curdlan-mediated activation (Fig. 5). Thus, it is strongly suggested that the short (1→3)-β-d-glucans with the random structures bind to the curdlan-recognizing protein or receptor, but are too short to support the activation of this protein. Since linear (1→3)-β-d-glucans with a DP of <20 are soluble, and the soluble fraction of the zymolyase-treated curdlan did not exhibit the NF-κB- activating activity; the active glucans should have DPs of more than 20. Branched (1→3)-β-d-glucans as long as curdlan were incapable of inducing the NF-κB activation. It has been shown that activation of the horseshoe crab factor G is induced by the intermolecular interaction of factor G molecules on a template of linear and sufficiently long (1→3)-β-d-glucans that support the collision of the molecules (14Muta T.

Kawabata S. Iwanaga S. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14281-14287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The curdlan-recognizing protein or receptor might be activated by a mechanism similar to that of factor G, thereby leading to the activation of macrophages. Although many reports have described the activity of β-glucans as BRMin vivo, much less is known about the in vitroactivity of (1→3)-β-d-glucans. This fact suggests that a complex system is required to express the activity of (1→3)-β-d-glucans. As we showed in this paper, the macrophage-stimulating activity of curdlan requires disassembly or disruption of the multiple-stranded helices at junction zones of the linear (1→3)-β-d-glucans. From a physiological or pathological point of views, it is an intriguing finding that curdlan was activated by zymolyase. On fungal cell surfaces, (1→3)-β-d-glucans exist as an insoluble matrix immobilized on the cell walls, which could be enzymatically released by a glucan-hydrolase(s) such as (1→3)-β-, (1→6)-β-, or (1→4)-β-d-glucosidase. The released fragments may be the activators for macrophages. In addition, some carrier proteins for the released insoluble fragments might be present. If the cells producing such glucosidases and/or carrier proteins are different from the cells activated by the modified (1→3)-β-d-glucans, it is not hard to imagine that a series of reactions would be difficult to reconstitute in the in vitro systems. Elucidation of the physiological or pathological modification of (1→3)-β-d-glucans, and the identification of the receptor responsible for the glucan-mediated signaling should lead to a better understanding of the responses of the innate immune system to fungi, as well as the development of a new therapeutic utilization of (1→3)-β-d-glucans as an effective BRM.

The sHSPs are induced under a variety of stresses and act to increase cellular tolerance to these conditions. Additionally, they have been implicated in cancer, cataract, neurodegenerative diseases, and myopathy (1Arrigo A.-P. Muller W.E.G. Arrigo A.-P. Muller W.E.G. Small Stress Proteins.

It is not clearly understood how the sHSPs become involved in such diseases, but current models propose that they act primarily as molecular chaperones, preventing improper protein associations (5Haslbeck M. Buchner J. Arrigo A.-P. Muller W.E.G. Small Stress Proteins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 37-59Google Scholar). This is evidenced by their ability to bind nonnative proteins under different stress conditions, thereby preventing their irreversible aggregation and consequent damage to the cell (6Lindner R.A.

Luenissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. Arrigo A.-P. Muller W.E.G. Small Stress Proteins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 1-17Google Scholar, 15de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) and typically have subunit masses between 15 and 40 kDa. The proteins assemble into large oligomers containing 9 to >24 monomers of varying heterogeneity. Some sHSPs such as those from plants form assemblies with well defined stoichiometries, whereas other sHSPs including the mammalian proteins form a range of oligomeric sizes (16Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. McHaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). This polydispersity has limited the amount of structural information available, and consequently, only two x-ray structures have been reported thus far for intact sHSPs, those of Methanococcus jannaschii HSP16.5 (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar) andTriticum aestivum HSP16.9 (18van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Compared with the wealth of such information available for other molecular chaperones, the sHSP family remains relatively poorly understood. Fig. 1 shows the structure ofTaHSP16.9 along the crystallographic 3-fold axis (Fig.1 A) and along one of the 2-fold axes (Fig. 1 B).TaHSP16.9 is composed of 12 subunits arranged into two hexameric rings. Six of the monomers in the dodecamer are fully resolved, but the others have disordered N-terminal arms, which remain unresolved in the crystal structure. In MjHSP16.5, which forms a spherical 24-mer (17Kim K.K. Kim R. Kim S.H. Nature. 1998; 394: 595-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar), the N-terminal arms were revealed by cryoelectron microscopy to partially fill the central cavity (16Haley D.A. Bova M.P. Huang Q.L. McHaourab H.S. Stewart P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 261-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). EachTaHSP16.9 subunit interacts with four others, forming five different interfaces. The strongest of these dimeric interactions are thought to be those arising from β-strand donation between two partner monomers in the same ring (Fig. 1 A). These dimeric “building blocks,” which take the same form inMjHSP16.5, interact with those adjacent through hinged C-terminal extensions, and there is additional stabilization of the dodecamer by the pairwise intertwining of N-terminal helices (Fig.1 B) (18van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Despite having what appears to be a tightly bound and rigid structure, TaHSP16.9 has been shown to undergo a structural change and form suboligomeric species at higher temperatures. Furthermore, in the same study, TaHSP16.9 has been shown to interact with its close homologue Pisum sativum HSP18.1 (also a cytosolic class I sHSP) to form complexes that show intermediate migration behavior in nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Although the identity of these new complexes remains unclear, they were proposed to be heterododecamers formed by subunit exchange between the two sHSPs (18van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Such subunit exchange had previously been shown to occur between sHSPs from other plants (19Helm K.W. Lee G.J. Vierling E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1997; 114: 1477-1485Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum (20Studer S. Narberhaus F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37212-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, in both cases, exchange was shown only to occur if the proteins were of the same class. In mammals, various sHSPs are capable of exchanging subunits. In the vertebrate eye lens, α-crystallin forms heteroaggregates containing αA- and αB-subunits at an approximate 3:1 ratio (15de Jong W.W. Caspers G.J. Leunissen J.A.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1998; 22: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar), and these have been shown to have a dynamic quaternary structure (21Datta S.A. Rao C.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), and mixed aggregates of αB, HSP27, and HSP20 as well as HSPB2 and HSPB3 have been found in muscle cells (26Sugiyama Y. Suzuki A. Kishikawa M. Akutsu R. Hirose T. Waye M.M.Y. Tsui S.K.W. Yoshida S. Ohno S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1095-1104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). It is not clear what the function of such facile intermolecular subunit exchange in sHSPs may be, but with several sHSPs being expressed in the same cellular compartments (14Kappé G. Luenissen J.A.M. de Jong W.W. Arrigo A.-P. Muller W.E.G. Small Stress Proteins. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2002: 1-17Google Scholar, 27Waters E.R. Lee G.J. Vierling E. J. Exp.

Genetics. 1995; 141: 785-795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it seems probable that the formation of such heterocomplexes will also commonly occur in vivo. Mass spectrometry (MS) is well established as a method for measuring the masses of individual proteins. When coupled with nanoelectrospray ionization (nanoESI), MS is being increasingly recognized as a technique capable of measuring the mass and probing the properties of intact macromolecular assemblies (30Loo J.A. Int. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 200: 175-186Crossref Scopus (434) Google Scholar, 31Hernández H. Robinson C.V. J. Biol.

Using a protocol of appropriate solution conditions and maintaining many low energy collisions with a bath gas to absorb the excess translational energy of the ions during their desolvation, large macromolecular assemblies can be transported intact through the mass spectrometer. Molecules with masses of over 2 MDa have been mass-measured in this way (32Tito M.A. Tars K. Valegard K. Hajdu J. Robinson C.V. J. Am. Chem.

In the case of MtGimC, the subunit stoichiometry and interactions were elucidated by MS by following the assembly of the complex in real-time. Although fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been used to monitor the subunit exchange among sHSP oligomers (23Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar,25Bova M.P. Mchaourab H.S. Han Y. Fung B.K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1035-1042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), it is unable to identify individual species and their abundances, and consequently, it only presents an averaged picture of the reaction. MS on the other hand has not been widely applied to the investigation of such problems, yet with the ability to preserve subunit interactions, rapid data acquisition, and mass accuracy, it is a potentially powerful method. Here we present the application of nanoESI-MS to the investigation of the subunit exchange reaction between two sHSPs, TaHSP16.9 and PsHSP18.1. We find that we can measure the relative populations of heterocomplexes differing by only one protein subunit and can thereby monitor the exchange reaction at the molecular level in real-time. TaHSP16.9 from T. aestivum(wheat) was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (18van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Its amino acid sequence is given by GenBankTM accession number S21600 with one change T7S and absence of the N-terminal Met (sequence mass 16722.0 Da).PsHSP18.1 from P. sativum (pea) was expressed inE. coli and purified as described previously (38Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The sequence is given by GenBankTM accession number P19243 with one change P37L and absence of the N-terminal Met (17970.3 Da). Cesium iodide and ammonium acetate were obtained from Sigma. Buffer solutions were prepared from purified water (Millipore, Watford, United Kingdom). Mass spectra were recorded on a tandem-mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) modified for high mass operation (39Sobott F. Hernández H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). NanoESI capillaries were prepared in-house from borosilicate glass tubes of 1-mm-outer and 0.5-mm-inner diameters (Harvard Apparatus, Holliston, MA) using a Flaming/Brown P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments, Hercules, CA) and gold-coated using a sputter coater (Polaron, Newhaven, United Kingdom). The capillary tips were cut under a stereomicroscope to give inner diameters of 1–5 μm, and typically 0.5–2 μl of solution were loaded for sampling. The conditions within the mass spectrometer (specifically pressures and accelerating potentials) were adjusted to preserve noncovalent interactions. The following experimental parameters were typically used (positive ion mode): capillary voltage, 1.7 kV; cone gas, 100 liters/h; sample cone, 180 V; extractor cone, 20 V; collision energy, 4 V; ion transfer stage pressure, 4.0 × 10−3 mbar; quadruple analyzer pressure, 1.8 × 10−5 millibar; Tof analyzer pressure, 4.7 × 10−7 mbar; and spectrum acquisition frequency, 3.9 kHz. External calibration of the spectra was achieved using solutions of cesium iodide. Data were acquired and processed with MassLynx software (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom). All spectra are shown with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction. The series of peaks that arise for each species are attributed to different numbers of protons attached to the molecular ion. Their mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios follow the equationm/z = (Mprotein + z· MH+)/z where Mprotein is the protein mass, MH+ is the mass of a proton, and zis the number of protons (charges). Multiple protonation is induced by the electrospray process and occurs up to a maximum approximately corresponding to the number of basic accessible sites in the protein (40Kebarle P. J. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 35: 804-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Transformation of the signal from anm/z to mass scale is performed using MassLynx by multiplication of the m/z value of each peak with the number of charges z and subtraction of ztimes the proton mass. We used tandem MS where ions are selected by the quadrupole mass analyzer of the Q-Tof and subjected to collision-induced dissociation (CID) in a gas-filled collision cell to reveal the composition of the noncovalent complexes (39Sobott F. Hernández H. McCammon M.G. Tito M.A. Robinson C.V. Anal. Chem. 2002; 74: 1402-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). sHSP samples were stored at −20 °C and buffer-exchanged twice into 200 mm aqueous ammonium acetate (pH 7.0) using microcentrifuge columns (Bio-Spin, Bio-Rad). Buffer exchange and sample introduction were conducted at room temperature (24 ± 2 °C). For the subunit exchange equilibration experiments, different volumes of the two protein solutions were combined to give the appropriate molar ratios, vortexed briefly, and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for ∼2 h before analysis. Incubating the samples for longer periods of time did not result in further reaction, only a deterioration in the mass spectra. To monitor the exchange kinetics in real-time, we combinedPsHSP18.1 and TaHSP16.9 at a ratio of 3:1 to give a final volume of 20 μl at a total protein concentration of 37.5 μm (dodecamer). A 2-μl aliquot of this sample was loaded into a capillary and introduced immediately into the mass spectrometer. We were able to acquire the first data within 40 s of mixing, and we acquired data continuously for ∼40 min. The remaining sample was kept at room temperature and analyzed after ∼9 h to verify the end point of the reaction. To confirm that continuous spraying of the solution during the reaction process did not effect the exchange reaction, individual aliquots were analyzed at different time intervals and the resulting spectra were found to be indistinguishable from those obtained during the continuous sampling experiment (data not shown). To extract kinetic information from the time-resolved data, we combined spectra over 8-s intervals around 29 time points in addition to the end point. Because of the overlap of a number of peaks in the mass spectrum that arises from the heterogeneity of the mixed oligomers, only the intensities (peak heights) of those signals, which could be assigned unambiguously, were taken into account. The following peaks were monitored: m/z5906 and 5737 for (16.9)12; m/z 6746 and 6541 for (18.1)12; m/z 6312 and 6130 for (18.1)11(16.9)1;m/z 6669, 6466, and 6095 for (18.1)10(16.9)2; m/z6630, 6430, 6239, and 6059 for (18.1)9(16.9)3; and m/z 6590, 6390, 6202, and 6024 for (18.1)8(16.9)4. The intensities of each component were expressed as percentages of the total intensity, and the scale adjusted to the initial and final abundances in solution (given by a theoretical binomial distribution) (see below). Initial decay rates were calculated by plotting the natural logarithm of the intensity versus time and fitting linear lines of best fit. The simulated spectrum was constructed using SigmaPlot 2001 (SPSS Science, Chicago, IL). Theoretical intensities of the 13 different dodecamers were calculated based on a binomial distribution of the components PsHSP18.1 and TaHSP16.9 at a ratio of 3:1, assuming an equal preference for each composition. The statistical propensity, Pn, of individual dodecamers containing n times the 18.1 subunit is given by Equation 1 Pn=12!n!(12−n)!(P18.1)n(P16.9)12−nEquation 1 where P18.1 and P16.9 are the relative abundances of HSP18.1 and 16.9 subunits in solution (0.75 and 0.25, respectively, for a 3:1 ratio). The last two terms describe the probability of finding certain numbers of each subunit in the complex, whereas the first term accounts for the number of possible arrangements of these subunits within the complex. A three-parameter Gaussian curve was fitted across the tops of the peaks in the spectra of the two individual sHSPs. The midpoint and width of these curves were used to create similar ones for the theoretical charge state distributions of the heterododecamers. Their maxima were scaled to the theoretical intensity of the various species. Three-parameter Lorentzian curves were used to model individual peaks with a peak width at half-height of 10 Da as measured from the charge states in the mass spectra of the homododecamers. The intensity was given by solution of the Gaussian function for that charge state. Combining all simulated peaks resulted in the total simulation. Fig.2 shows nanoESI mass spectra of the small heat shock proteins PsHSP18.1 and TaHSP16.9 under conditions optimized for the transmission of intact noncovalent complexes. The dominant feature of both spectra is the group of peaks around an m/z value of 6000 (left panels) with very little additional signal outside this range. Fig. 2, right panels, show a transformation of the peaks in this range from an m/z to a mass scale. ForTaHSP16.9 (Fig. 2 A), only one major speciesa is detected with a molecular mass of 200,790 Da. This mass compares well with the mass calculated for 12 TaHSP16.9 monomers (200,663.6 Da). Therefore, we conclude thatTaHSP16.9 forms a dodecamer in solution as expected from its x-ray structure (Fig. 1) (18van Montfort R.L.M. Basha E. Friedrich K.L. Slingsby C. Vierling E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1025-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). The observation that the experimental mass is slightly higher than that calculated from the sequence (in this case by ∼126 Da) is common for mass spectra of noncovalent complexes and is attributed to the binding of solvent molecules and buffer ions, presumably at the subunit interfaces (41Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai Z. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mass spectrum recorded for a solution of PsHSP18.1 is similar to that of TaHSP16.9, although the peaks appear at a slightly higher m/z and carry on average more charges (Fig. 2 B). Here we observe three distinct complexes of similar mass: 215,850 (for b), 215,215 (forc), and 214,452 Da (for d). Again, the complexes consist of 12 subunits as seen by comparison with a theoretical mass for the dodecamer of 215,643.7 Da. More than one-third of the totalPsHSP18.1 signal resides in peaks c andd. The isolation of these species in the quadrupole analyzer of the instrument and subsequent collision-induced dissociation (CID) reveals that dodecamer b consists of 12 identical copies of the full-length protein, whereas c and d each contain one subunit with a truncation of the first six (c) and 13 (d) N-terminal amino acids, respectively (CID spectra not shown). These truncations are likely to have arisen during protein expression and purification. As their presence does not destabilize the complex relative to CID (spectra not shown), they do not appear to compromise the formation of the dodecamer in these quantities. We used mass spectrometry to determine the products of the reaction between PsHSP18.1 andTaHSP16.9 at four different molar ratios (6:1, 3:1, 1:3, and 1:6). Spectra recorded after equilibration of mixtures at molar ratios of 6:1 and 1:6 of the two sHSPs are shown in Fig.3, A and B, respectively. Many peaks are observed that are not present in the spectra of the individual sHSPs. Mass measurement shows that they arise from dodecamers containing subunits of both sHSPs. At a 6:1 ratio (Fig.3 A), peaks are observed that correspond to a range of heterododecamers containing between 8 and 12 PsHSP18.1 monomers, and the most intense signal is attributed to the species (18.1)10(16.9)2. The minor peaks not labeled in this spectrum arise from heterododecamers containing truncatedPsHSP18.1 subunits. For the opposite 1:6 ratio, dodecamers can be seen that contain between 8 and 12 TaHSP16.9 monomers (Fig. 3 B). Here the species with the highest intensity is (18.1)2(16.9)10. The charge state ensemble has shifted to lower m/z values relative to the 6:1 ratio because of the presence of fewer PsHSP18.1 monomers within the dodecamers. The comparatively low PsHSP18.1 concentration also explains the apparent absence of peaks, which are because of dodecamers containing truncated subunits. Similarly, at 18.1:16.9 ratios of 3:1 (Fig.4 A, upper part) and 1:3 (data not shown), we find the most intense species to be (18.1)9(16.9)3 and (18.1)3(16.9)9, respectively, after equilibration.Figure 4Simulated and measured electrospray mass spectra of the products of subunit exchange betweenPsHSP18.1 and TaHSP16.9 at a molar ratio of 3:1. Theoretical intensities of the individual species were calculated based on a binomial distribution of the components as expected for freely interchangeable subunits (see inset,cf. Eq. 1). The summation over all species (lower black trace) is in close agreement with the experimental spectrum (upper black trace).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the mixtures studied above, it appears that the intensities of heterododecamers formed by subunit exchange is governed by the relative concentration of the individual sHSPs in solution. In other words, the distribution of heterododecamers appears to be centered on the ratio of the two components in the mixture. For example, the most abundant heterododecamer formed from an 18.1:16.9 ratio of 3:1 is (18.1)9(16.9)3. To establish whether the distribution of the different heterocomplexes is determined solely by the abundance of the sHSP subunits in solution, we simulated a “statistical” spectrum, assuming no preference for the uptake of monomers of either sHSP nor any inherent preference for particular stoichiometries. The histogram in Fig. 4, inset, shows the theoretical binomial distribution of heterocomplexes for an 18.1:16.9 ratio of 3:1 according to Equation 1. From this distribution, it can be seen that the dominant species is indeed (18.1)9(16.9)3 among a broad range of different compositions ranging from (18.1)4(16.9)8(n = 4) to the homododecamer (18.1)12(n = 12). Using the theoretical abundances of the different species from the histogram and their theoretical charge state distribution (see “Experimental procedures”), we plotted simulated ESI spectra for all dodecamers (Fig. 4, lower part). The sum of all of these overlapping species corresponds well to the actual mass spectrum recorded for a 3:1 ratio (Fig. 4, upper part). The major difference between the simulated and experimental data is the appearance of a higher background signal, which we attribute primarily to overlapping peaks arising from multiple charge states of both fu"

HSs play critical roles in a variety of important biological processes, including assisting viral infection, regulating blood coagulation and embryonic development, suppressing tumor growth, and controlling the eating behavior of mice by interacting with specific regulatory proteins (1Liu J.

HS polysaccharides carry negative charges under physiological pH, and the disaccharide repeating units consist of 1→4-linked sulfated glucosamine and uronic acid. The unique sequences determine to which specific proteins HSs bind, thereby regulating biological processes. The biosynthesis of HS occurs in the Golgi apparatus. It is initially synthesized as a copolymer of glucuronic acid andN-acetylated glucosamine by d-glucuronyl andN-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase, followed by various modifications (6Lindahl U. Kusche-Gullberg M. Kjellen L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24979-24982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). These modifications includeN-deacetylation and N-sulfation of glucosamine, C5 epimerization of glucuronic acid to form iduronic acid residues, 2-O-sulfation of iduronic and glucuronic acid, as well as 6-O-sulfation and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine. Several enzymes that are responsible for the biosynthesis of HS have been cloned and characterized (see review by Esko and Lindahl (7Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). These enzymes have become essential tools for investigating the relationship between the structures and functions of HS. What is still unknown is the detailed mechanism for regulating the biosynthesis of HS with a defined saccharide sequence. A recent report (8Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinaÿ P. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L.

Chem. 1999; 274: 5185-5192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar) suggests that the expression levels of various HS biosynthetic enzyme isoforms contribute to the synthesis of specific saccharide sequences in specific tissues. HSN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, 3-O-sulfotransferase, and 6-O-sulfotransferase are present in multiple isoforms. Each isoform is believed to recognize a saccharide sequence around the modification site in order to generate a specific sulfated saccharide sequence (8Liu J. Shworak N.W. Sinaÿ P. Schwartz J.J.

For instance, HSd-glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST) isoforms generate 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residues that are linked to different sulfated uronic acid residues. 3-OST-1 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of an N-sulfated glucosamine residue that is linked to a glucuronic acid residue at the nonreducing end (GlcUA-GlcNS±6S). However, 3-OST-3 transfers sulfate to the 3-OH position of an N-unsubstituted glucosamine residue that is linked to a 2-O-sulfated iduronic acid at the nonreducing end (IdoUA2S-GlcNH2±6S) (11Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The difference in the substrate specificity of 3-OSTs results in distinct biological functions. For example, the HS modified by 3-OST-1 binds to antithrombin (AT) and has anticoagulant activity (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, the HS modified by 3-OST-3 (3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B) 2Human 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B have nearly identical amino acid sequences in the proposed sulfotransferase domain. Both enzymes sulfate identical disaccharides and have the activity in assisting HSV-1 entry. For clarity, we used 3-OST-3 to represent both 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B unless specified otherwise. 2Human 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B have nearly identical amino acid sequences in the proposed sulfotransferase domain.

The HS- and heparin-regulated anticoagulation mechanisms have been studied extensively. It is now known that HS and heparin interact with AT, a serine protease inhibitor, to inhibit the activities of thrombin and factor Xa in the blood coagulation cascade (2Rosenberg R.D. Showrak N.W. Liu J. Schwartz J.J. Zhang L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2062-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Anticoagulant-active HS (HSact) and heparin contain one or multiple AT-binding sites per polysaccharide chain. This binding site contains a specific pentasaccharide sequence with a structure of −GlcNS(or Ac)6S-GlcUA-GlcNS3S(±6S)-IdoUA2S-GlcNS6S-. The 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine for generating GlcNS3S(±6S) residue, which is carried out by 3-OST-1 (EC 2.8.2.23), is the critical modification for the synthesis of HSact (12Liu J. Shworak N.W.

Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) suggests that a specific 3-O-sulfated HS is involved in assisting HSV-1 entry. The 3-O-sulfated HS is generated by 3-OST-3 but not by 3-OST-1. In addition, the 3-O-sulfated HS provides binding sites for HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein D, which is a key viral protein involved in the entry of HSV-1 (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W.

Because 3-OST-3-modified HS is rarely found in HS from natural sources, the study suggests that HSV-1 recognizes a unique saccharide structure. Indeed, the result from the structural characterization of a gD-binding octasaccharide revealed that the octasaccharide possesses a specific saccharide sequence (16Liu J. Shriver Z. Pope R.M. Thorp S.C. Duncan M.B. Copeland R.J. Raska C.S. Yoshida K. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G. Linhardt R.J. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33456-33467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In addition, the binding affinity of the 3-O-sulfated HS for gD is about 2 μm (13Shukla D. Liu J.

This affinity is similar to that reported for the binding of gD to the protein receptors, suggesting that HSV-1 utilizes both protein and HS cell surface receptors to infect target cells (17Willis S.H.

It is believed that the interaction between gD and the 3-O-sulfated HS or the protein entry receptors somehow triggers the fusion between the virus and the cell in the presence of other viral envelope proteins, including gB, gH, and gL (19Shukla D. Spear P.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A study of the co-crystal structure of gD and herpes entry receptor HveA suggests that the binding of HveA to gD induces conformational changes in gD (20Carfi A. Willis S.H. Whitbeck J.C. Krummenacher C. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Wiley D.C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 169-179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is known that the enzymes for synthesizing HSact and an entry receptor for HSV-1 belong to two 3-OST isoforms. These two isoforms generate the 3-O-sulfated glucosamine residue located in different saccharide sequences as described above. In this article, we report that a 3-OST homologous protein, designated as HS 3-O-sulfotransferase isoform-5 (3-OST-5), possesses the activities for generating both HSact and HSV-1 entry receptor (or gD-binding HS). Our results suggest that the biosynthesis of HSact and the gD-binding HS is regulated by several enzymes. The newly identified enzyme provides an additional tool for both understanding the mechanism for the biosynthesis of the biologically active HS and for investigating the relationship between the saccharide sequences and the biological functions of HS. Recombinant human 3-OST-3A and mouse 3-OST-1 enzymes were expressed in Sf9 cells using a baculovirus expression system.

The open reading frame sequence, designated as 3-OST-5, was located in two exons. Both 5′- and 3′-primers were synthesized based upon the sequence of exon 1 and exon 2, respectively. The following are the sequences of the two specific primers: 5′- GGAGGGCC ATG CTA TTC AAA CAG-3′ (5′-primer), and 5′-TTA GGG CCA GTT CAA TGT CCT-3′ (3′-primer). We cloned the cDNA using PCR from a human placenta cDNA library with the two specific primers. The resultant PCR product (about 1.0 kb) was inserted into the pGEM-T-easy vector (pGEM-T-3OST5) and sequenced for both strands. The isolated cDNA has an identical sequence that was predicted from the genomic clone. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was performed but failed. Both COS-7 and wild type CHO cells were from Dr. R. Jude Samulski (University of North Carolina). COS-7 cells and CHO cells were maintained in logarithmic growth by subculturing biweekly at 37 °C under 6% CO2 humidified atmosphere. COS-7 cells and CHO cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and in F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), respectively. 3-OST-5 expression plasmid was constructed by inserting the open reading frame of 3-OST-5 into a pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) expression vector. The open reading frame was obtained by reamplifying the sequence from pGEM-T-3OST5 by PCR using the following primers: 1) the 5′-specific primer, 5′-TCA AAGCTT GCCACCATG CTATTCAAACAGCA-3′, contains an HindIII site (underlined), the consensus Kozak sequence (italicized) and a start codon; and 2) the 3′-specific primer, 5′-GC TCTAGATTAGGGCCAGTTCAATGTCCT-3′, contains an XbaI site (underlined). PCRs were carried out using Advantage-2 PCR kit (CLONTECH) with the initial denaturation for 2 min at 94 °C, followed by 30 cycles of a reaction consisting of 45 s for denaturation at 94 °C, 45 s for annealing at 62 °C, and 90 s for elongation at 72 °C. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) usingHindIII/XbaI sites. The coding region of the construct was completely sequenced on both strands, and the construct was designated pcDNA3.1-3OST5. pcDNA3.1-3OST5 or pcDNA3 plasmid was transfected into exponentially growing COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The crude enzyme was extracted from transfected COS-7 cells. The cells were harvested 72 h after transfection. Approximately 3 × 106cells were mixed with 100 μl of cold 0.25 m sucrose containing 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) and incubated on ice for 30 min. The insoluble residues were removed after centrifuging at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The HS sulfotransferase activity was determined by incubating 40 μg of cell extract with 1 μg of unlabeled HS (from 33-cells), 4 × 107 cpm of [35S]PAPS, in 50 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm MES, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2 and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7). The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, quenched by heating at 100 °C for 1 min, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min to remove insoluble materials. The sample was then subjected to a 200-μl DEAE-Sepharose column to purify [35S]HS (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The [35S]HS modified by 3-OST-5 was mixed with 20 μg of unlabeled HS (from ICN) and degraded with nitrous acid at pH 1.5 followed by reduction with sodium borohydride (26Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). The resultant35S-labeled disaccharides were mixed with a3H-labeled disaccharide standard, IdoUA2S-[1-3H]AnMan6S, and desalted on a Bio-Gel P-2 column (0.75 × 200 cm) that was equilibrated with 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate at a flow rate of 4 ml/h. The3H-labeled disaccharide standard was used to locate the elution position of the disaccharides from the Bio-Gel P-2 column. The disaccharides were resolved by a C18-reversed phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) (Vydac) under the reverse-phase ion-pairing HPLC (RPIP-HPLC) condition (11Liu J. Shriver Z. Blaiklock P. Yoshida K. Sasisekharan R. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38155-38162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, the column was eluted with acetonitrile as follows: 8% for 30 min followed by 15% for 15 min and followed by 19.5%, in a solution containing 38 mm ammonium phosphate monobasic, 2 mm phosphoric acid, and 1 mm tetrabutylammonium phosphate monobasic (Fluka) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. To prepare 3-OST-3-modified HS, HS (1 μg from 33-cells) was mixed with 30 ng of purified 3-OST-3A enzyme and [35S]PAPS (4 × 107 cpm) in a buffer containing 50 mm MES, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mmMnCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 168 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7), in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and was then heated at 100 °C for 2 min. The resultant product was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 1 min to remove insoluble materials. The supernatant was loaded onto a 200 μl DEAE-Sepharose column, and the [35S]HS was eluted from the column with 1000 mm NaCl (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). To prepare 3-OST-1-modified HS, we utilized 70 ng of purified enzyme and followed nearly identical procedures except for omitting the 150 mmNaCl. The binding of the 3-OST-5-modified HS to AT was determined using an AT/concanavalin A (ConA)-Sepharose approach (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, HS (10,000–100,000 cpm) was incubated in 150 μl of a buffer, which contains 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 μm dextran sulfate, 1 mm Ca2+, Mg2+, and Mn2+, and 0.1 mg/ml AT (pH 7.5), at room temperature for 30 min. The solution was mixed with the prewashed ConA-Sepharose (60 μl of 1:1 slurry) and agitated at room temperature for 1 h. The gel was then washed with 3 × 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.0004% Triton X-100, and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.5). The HS was eluted from the gel by 1 ml of a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1000 mmNaCl, and 0.0004% Triton X-100 (pH 7.5). The assay for determining the binding of 3-O-sulfated HS to gD was carried out by an immunoprecipitation procedure using anti-gD monoclonal antibody (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W.

The enzyme-modified HS (100,000–200,000 cpm) was incubated in 50 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mmNaCl, and 0.01% Triton (pH 7) (binding buffer), and 2 mg/ml of gD at room temperature for 30 min. The anti-gD monoclonal antibody DL6 (5 μl) was added and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h followed by the addition of protein A-agarose gel (80 μl of 1:1 slurry) and agitated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The HS was eluted from the gel with 1 ml of 1000 mm NaCl in the binding buffer. The assay was specifically designed to determine the HS biosynthetic activity that generates HSact (12Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell extract was incubated with metabolically 35S-labeled nonanticoagulant HS (from wild type CHO cells) and unlabeled PAPS. The resultant [35S]HS was subjected to the AT-binding assay as described above. The increase in the percentage of the [35S]HS that binds to AT correlated to the amount of HSact conversion activity in the cell extract. The conditions for growing cells and different HSV strains were described previously (13Shukla D. Liu J. Blaiklock P. Shworak N.W. Bai X. Esko J.D. Cohen G.H. Eisenberg R.J. Rosenberg R.D. Spear P.G. Cell. 1999; 99: 13-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The viral infectivity assay is based on visualization of the cells carrying β-galactosidase activity (25Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J. Mulligan R.C. Birinyi L.K. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24941-24952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected in 6-well dishes, using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) with pcDNA3.1–3OST5 plasmid or control plasmid (pcDNA3) at 1.5–2.0 μg per well in 1 ml. At about 36 h post-transfection, cells were exposed to recombinant HSV-1 (HSV-1(KOS)gL86) (a gift from Dr. Spear, Northwestern University) that expresses β-galactosidase upon viral entry. At 6 h post-infection, the cells were fixed in PBS containing 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde, permeabilized in 2 mmMgCl2 containing 0.01% deoxycholate and 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with buffered X-gal (0.5 mg/ml). Three hours later the infected cells were visible in blue due to the action of β-galactosidase on X-gal. The transfection efficiency for CHO cells was determined by transfecting a plasmid expressing β-galactosidase as a reporter gene. The coding sequence of 3-OST-5 was labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP in a reaction with Klenow enzyme (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as a probe to hybridize the Human Multiple Tissue Northern (MTN®) blot (CLONTECH). The hybridization was carried out in ExpressHyb Hybridization Solution (CLONTECH) at 60 °C for 1 h, and the blot was washed with 0.1× SSC containing 0.5% SDS at 60 °C for 40 min (where 1× SSC contains 150 mm NaCl and 15 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0). The membrane was exposed to an x-ray film for 4 days. Probing the non-redundant data base of National Center for Biotechnology Information with the deduced amino acid sequence of human 3-OST-1 (accession number AF033827), we identified a 165-kb genomic clone with GenBankTM accession number AL355498. An open reading frame was found to be 1041 bp. The predicted open reading frame was located in two exons that were gapped by a 4.5-kb intron. The open reading frame of this protein, assigned as 3-OST-5, was amplified from a human placenta cDNA library using specific 5′- and 3′-primers as described under “Experimental Procedures.” 3-OST-5 cDNA sequence and the predicted amino acid sequence are shown in Fig.1. We attempted to obtain further upstream 3-OST-5 sequence by using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends but failed. The isolated 3-OST-5 cDNA contains 1041 bp, and the deduced peptide of 346 amino acid residues predicts a type II membrane-bound protein. The protein has four potentialN-glycosylation sites with the predicted molecular mass of 40,407 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of 3-OST-5 has 71 and 58% homology to 3-OST-1 and 3-OST-3 in the sulfotransferase domains, respectively (Fig. 2). Putative PAPS-binding sites were also found in 3-OST-5 based upon the PAPS-binding consensus sequences (27Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C.

The genomic BAC clone RP11-112L15, which contains 3-OST-5 gene, was annotated to be mapped on human chromosome 11q22.2. Alignment of the genomic sequence with 3-OST-5 cDNA revealed that exon 1 and exon 2 contain 107 and 934 bp of the open reading frame, respectively.Figure 2Multiple amino acid sequence alignment of human 3-OST-5 with human 3-OST-1, 3-OST-3A, and 3-OST-3B.

Various pathogenic mechanisms have been proposed, including inflammatory responses to a persistent luminal pathogen or abnormal luminal constituent, autoimmunity, or an overly aggressive immune response to normal luminal constituents such as commensal enteric bacteria. The hypothesis that aberrant immune responses to non-pathogenic commensal luminal bacteria can cause colitis in genetically predisposed individuals is supported by several rodent models of experimental colitis (3Blumberg R.S.

For example, HLA-B27/β2-microglobulin transgenic rats raised under specific pathogen-free conditions spontaneously develop colitis, whereas germ-free (sterile) conditions prevent the development of chronic inflammation (6Rath H.C.

Of note, this B. vulgatus strain induced no colitis in wild type rats, documenting its wild type nature (8Rath H.C. Wilson K.H. Sartor R.B. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 2969-2974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these observations suggesting a central role of non-pathogenic resident luminal bacteria in the regulation of intestinal inflammation, the mechanisms by which bacteria influence the mucosal immune response responsible for inducing and perpetuating chronic colitis remain unclear. A single layer of intestinal epithelial cells (IEC)1 isolate the host from the gut luminal environment. These cells are considered to be an integral and essential component of the innate mucosal immune system of the host (10Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 6-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). IEC constitutively express, or can be induced to express, co-stimulatory molecules and components of the human major histocompatibility complex including class II and classical I and non-classical class Ib human major histocompatibility complex molecules (11Blumberg R.S.

Moreover, proinflammatory stimuli (e.g. TNF and IL-1) as well as certain enteric pathogens (e.g. Salmonella species, Yersinia enterocolitica, and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli) induce the expression and secretion of a wide range of inflammatory and chemoattractive cytokines in IEC including TNF, IL-8, MCP-1, IP-10, GROα, inducible nitric-oxide synthase, and COX-2 as well as the adhesion molecule ICAM-1 (14McCormick B.A. Colgan S.P.

Hartland E.L. Robins-Browne R.M. Cornelis G.R. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2106-2113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in multiple cell systems including IEC, most of these proinflammatory molecules are in part regulated at the transcriptional level by the transcription factor NF-κB (20Tak P.P. Firestein G.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 7-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (3287) Google Scholar). Activation of the IκB/NF-κB system is a complex process that involves the participation of multiple adapter proteins and kinases acting in a coordinated fashion to give specificity to the cell surface stimuli. Although IL-1 and TNF signaling events leading to NF-κB activation has been well studied (21Jobin C. Sartor R.B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C451-C462Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the molecular mechanisms of bacterial signaling to the IκB/NF-κB transcriptional system in IEC are still largely unknown. The major molecular determinant of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for NF-κB activation is the glycolipid lipopolysaccharide (LPS). This bacterial product signals to the IκB/NF-κB system by using the cell surface toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and its co-receptor MD-2 which then utilize downstream components of the IL-1 signaling cascade (22Zhang G. Ghosh S. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 107: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar, 23Tapping R.I. Akashi S. Miyake K. Godowski P.J. Tobias P.S. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 11058-11063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). For example, TLR4 engagement by LPS leads to the sequential recruitment/activation of the myeloid differentiation protein (MyD88), the IL-1 receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6, and the transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase (TAK) 1. Although controversial, the signal may converge on the NF-κB-inducing kinase, which then activates the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. The activated IKK complex phosphorylates IκBα at serine residues 32 and 36, which triggers its ubiquination/degradation and subsequent release of NF-κB, which then translocates to the nucleus and activates the transcription of κB-dependent genes (25Beutler B.

The precise mechanism for increased transcriptional activity is not clear but may involve enhanced recruitment of transcriptional co-activator such as cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP/p300) to the promoter site of some specific genes. Although IEC lines were shown to express TLR4 (36Cario E. Podolsky D.K. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 7010-7017Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar, 37Cario E. Rosenberg I.M. Brandwein S.L.

In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of NF-κB activation triggered by the Gram-negative, commensal bacterial strainB. vulgatus in the rat intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6, the human colonic cell line CaCO-2, and primary IEC derived from germ-free or B. vulgatus mono-associated HLA-B27/β2-microglobulin transgenic as well as wild type rats. We report that B. vulgatus induces NF-κB activation in IEC through components of the IL-1R/TLR4 pathway and the induction of RelA phosphorylation. The presence of lymphocytes negatively regulates bacteria-induced NF-κB activity, suggesting a potential role of immune cells in controlling IEC responsiveness to commensal bacteria. B. vulgatusderived from a guinea pig with carrageenan-induced colitis (a gift from A. B. Onderdonk, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA) was anaerobically grown at 37 °C in brain heart infusion broth supplemented with cysteine (0.05%), hemin (5 mg/liter), and resazurin.E. coli derived from a patient with active Crohn's disease (provided by the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory of the University of North Carolina Hospitals, Chapel Hill) and the human oral isolateEnterococcus faecalis (a gift from M.

The probiotic strain Lactobacillus paracasei strain GG of human intestinal origin (ConAgra, Lincoln, NE) was anaerobically grown in MRS broth 37 °C. All bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g, 15 min) at stationary growth phase, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (1×, pH 7.2, Invitrogen), and subsequently diluted to obtain final cell densities of 5 × 107 cfu/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). Bacterial lysates were prepared as described previously (40Cong Y. Brandwein S.L. McCabe R.P. Lazenby A. Birkenmeier E.H. Sundberg J.P. Elson C.O. J. Exp.

The rat nontransformed small intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 (passage 5–0) (ATCC CRL 1592, American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Manassas, VA) and the human adenocarcinoma intestinal epithelial cell line CaCO-2 (passage 30–50) (ATCC HTB 38) were grown to confluency in 12- or 6-well plates (Nunc) as described previously (41Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). CaCO-2 cells were used in liposome-based transfections, because IEC-6 cells are not permissive to transfections. Confluent cell monolayers were stimulated with 5 × 107 cfu/ml bacteria, bacterial lysate (200 or 50 μg of protein/ml), LPS (5 or 1 μg/ml; from E. coli serotype O111:B4, Sigma), TNF (5 ng/ml), and IL-1β (10 ng/ml) (both from R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for various times. To prevent bacterial growth, gentamicin (100 μg/ml) was added to the cultures after 2 h. Where indicated, cells were pretreated with cycloheximide (50 μg/ml, Sigma), triptolide (100 ng/ml, Biomol, Plymouth Meeting, PA), or wortmannin (100 nm, Sigma). Transwell leukocyte co-cultures with confluent CaCO-2 monolayers were established as described previously (42Haller D. Bode C. Hammes W.P. Pfeifer A.M.A. Schiffrin E.J. Blum S.

Briefly, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) derived from healthy volunteers were isolated using Ficoll-Paque 1077 (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation (500 × g, 30 min). To purify leukocyte subpopulations, PBMC were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 on 225-cm2 tissue culture plates (Costar) to allow adherence. Non-adherent peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were separated from adherent cells by aspiration. Adherent peripheral blood monocytes were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (1 time) and harvested by cell scraping. PBMC, PBL, or monocytes were added to the basolateral compartment of 6-well transwell inserts (0.4-mm pore size) at cell densities of 2 × 106/ml. IEC/leukocyte co-cultures were stimulated with bacteria by adding 5 × 107cfu/ml B. vulgatus to the apical surface of IEC monolayers and incubated for 4 h at 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Germ-free (sterile) HLA-B27 transgenic and wild type Fisher F344 rats were euthanized, and the entire small intestine as well as the large intestine were removed and placed in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' buffered saline solution (Invitrogen) containing 5% FCS. The small intestine was cut longitudinally, washed 3 times in calcium/magnesium-free Hanks' buffered saline solution (Invitrogen), cut into pieces 0.5 cm long, and incubated at 37 °C in 40 ml of RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS and 1 mmdithiothreitol for 30 min in an orbital shaker. The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS. The remaining tissue was incubated in 40 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (1×) containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol and 1.5 mm EDTA for an additional 15 min. The supernatant was filtered and centrifuged for 5 min at 400 × g, and the cell pellet was resuspended in RPMI 1640 containing 5% FCS. Finally, primary IEC were collected by centrifugation through a 25–40% discontinuous Percoll gradient at 600 × g for 20 min. Cell viability and purity was assessed by trypan blue exclusion and FACS analysis using rat anti-CD3 mAb (BD Biosciences, clone G4.18). Cells were >85% viable and >90% pure. Primary rat IEC at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml were incubated for 2 h in 5% CO2 at 37 °C and then stimulated with 5 × 107 cfu/ml B. vulgatus, L. paracasei, or medium alone for 4 h. Fisher F344 rats raised under germ-free conditions were transferred to B. vulgatus isolators at the age of 10 weeks. The animals were removed from the gnotobiotic isolator after 3 days and euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation within the next 3 h. Bacterial colonization was documented by fecal culture. Primary IEC were isolated from the small intestine, cecum, and colon as described above. Cells were prepared for Western blot as well as FACS analysis. IEC-6 cells were infected overnight with adenoviral dominant negative (dn) IKKβ (Ad5dnIKKβ), dnTAK1 (Ad5dnTAK1), dnTRAF-2 (Ad5dnTRAF-2), and Ad5IκBαAA in serum-free media (Opti-MEM, Invitrogen) at different multiplicity of infection (m.o.i., 0, 25, 50, and 100).

Ad5GFP containing green fluorescent protein and Ad5LacZ containing the E. coli β-galactosidase were used as viral negative control (41Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 226-234PubMed Google Scholar). The adenoviruses were washed off, and fresh medium containing serum without antibiotics was added. Cells were stimulated at various time points with B. vulgatus (5 × 107 cfu/ml), TNF (5 ng/ml), and IL-1β (10 ng/ml). Dominant negative TAK1 and the super-repressor IκBαAA contained an extra 27-bp DNA nucleotides coding for a peptide derived from hemagglutinin (HA) gene (YPYDVPDYA). Dominant negative IKKβ and dnTRAF-2 contained an extra 24-bp DNA nucleotides coding for the FLAG peptide (DYLDDDDL). Expression of HA- and FLAG-tagged mutant molecules in IEC-6 cells was controlled by immunofluorescent microscopy and Western blot analysis using mouse anti-HA (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and mouse anti-FLAG M2 (Eastman Kodak Co.) mAb. CaCO-2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen) as described previously (41Jobin C. Haskill S. Mayer L. Panja A. Sartor R.B. J.

Sartor R.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4447-4454PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing dominant negative TLR4 (0.8 μg; generous gift of Dr. Bruce Beutler, Scripps Research Institute) or (κB)3-luciferase (1 μg) were transfected in combination or alone as described as under “Results,” and the total amount of DNA was equalized with empty vector. Transfected cells were incubated overnight after which the DNA/LipofectAMINE was replaced with serum-containing media. Cells were then stimulated with B. vulgatus (5 × 107cfu/ml), TNF (5 ng/ml), IL-1β (10 ng/ml), or medium for 12 h. Cell extracts were prepared using enhanced luciferase assay reagents (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). Luciferase assay were performed on a Monolight 2010 luminometer for 20 s (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA), and results were normalized for extract protein concentrations measured with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), and 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified (RT-PCR) using specific primers for rat ICAM-1, COX-2, and β-actin as described previously (50Jobin C. Hellerbrand C. Licato L.L. Brenner D.A. Sartor R.B. Gut. 1998; 42: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide TLR4 primers used are as follows: TLR4-A (5′), 5-TGTCCCTGAACCCTATGAAC-3 (positions 795–812); TLR4-B (3′), 5-ACTCAAATCTCTCAAAAGGC-3 (positions 1211–1230).

The length of the amplified product was 438 and 422 bp, respectively. The PCR products (5 μl) were subjected to electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels containing GelStar fluorescent dye (FMC, Philadelphia, PA). Fluorescent staining was captured using an AlphaImager 2000 (AlphaInnotech, San Leandro, CA). IEC were stimulated for various times (0–4 h) with bacteria, bacterial products, or cytokines. The cells were lysed in 1× Laemmli buffer, and 20 μg of protein was subjected to electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Where indicated IEC-6 cells were pretreated for 1 h with 20 μm of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Peptide Institute, Japan).

Briefly, IEC-6 cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors after stimulation with B. vulgatus at various times. Where indicated IEC-6 cells were pretreated for 45 min with triptolide (100 ng/ml) or wortmannin (100 nm) or infected for 16 h with Ad5dnIKKβ, Ad5IκBαAA, or Ad5LacZ. 300 μg was immunoprecipitated with 2 μl of anti-IKKγ (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), and the kinase reaction was performed by incubating 25 ml of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm ATP, and 0.5 mCi of [32P]ATP with either glutathione S-transferase (GST)-p65-(1–305) or GST-p65-(354–551) (a generous gift of Dr. Hiroaki Sakurai, Tanabe Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) as substrate for 30 min at 30 °C. Substrate protein was resolved by gel electrophoresis, and phosphate incorporation was assessed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager analysis (Amersham Biosciences). IEC were stimulated with bacteria, bacterial products, or cytokines. ICAM-1 cell surface expression was analyzed after 24 h. Cell staining was performed for 20 min at 4 °C with saturating concentrations of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse anti-rat ICAM-1 mAb (IgG1, 1A29, Pharmingen). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated mouse IgG1 (G155–228, MOPC-21, G155–178, Pharmingen) was used as isotype control. The samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur® (BD Biosciences).

Using an optical trap and a two-channel flow cell to move single DNA molecules into buffer containing protein, we have measured the rates of DNA condensation and decondensation induced by the binding of Syrian hamster transition proteins TP1 and TP2 and protamines P1 and P2. The results show that both transition proteins condense free DNA, with rates similar to those of protamine 1 and 2. DNA molecules condensed with TP1 were significantly less stable than DNA condensed by protamine or by TP2. Experiments conducted with a peptide corresponding to the C-terminal 25 residues of TP2 showed that this domain is responsible for condensing DNA. Experiments conducted with two fragments of TP1 containing arginine and lysine residues demonstrated that DNA binding by TP1 must involve more than these basic sequences. Zinc facilitated the condensation of DNA by P2 but not by TP2. The dissociation rates of TP2 and P2 from DNA were not affected by the addition of zinc.

Hnilica L.S. Stein G.S. Stein J.L. Histones and Other Basic Nuclear Proteins. CRC Press, Orlando, FL1989: 165-182Google Scholar). Although the most dramatic change in condensation occurs in late-step spermatids (2Kierszenbaum A.L. Tres L.L. J.

Cache River Press, Vienna, IL1999: 55-70Google Scholar), the replacement of histones by these two transition proteins several days earlier coincides with the first appearance of a detectable change in the condensation state of chromatin (5Alfonso P.J.

Reprod. 1996; 54: 1141-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Studies in the rat have demonstrated that the deposition of the two transition proteins in spermatid chromatin occurs sequentially, with TP2 appearing first in step 10 spermatids. TP1 was observed to appear ∼24 h later in step 12 spermatids (7Kistler W.S. Henriksen K. Mali P. Parvinen M. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 374-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Previous experiments have shown that TP2 binds preferentially to CG sequences, and the observation that TP2 appears early in spermatid chromatin (8Kundu T.K. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15626-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) suggested that the function of TP2 may be to shut down transcription by binding to the CG islands that are associated with gene promoter domains. TP1, which appears a day later, has been reported to stimulate DNA repair of single-stranded breaks (9Caron N. Veilleux S. Boissonneault G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 58: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and is suggested to function by binding to the breaks induced during the removal of the histones until they can be repaired (9Caron N. Veilleux S. Boissonneault G. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 58: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 10Kierszenbaum A.L. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 58: 357-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Following the removal of the histones and the repair or ligation of the single-stranded breaks, protamines are synthesized and deposited on chromatin to complete the compaction of the chromatin and ensure the sperm genome remains inactive until it can be deposited inside an egg and reactivated. Protamines, on the other hand, are highly charged, arginine-rich proteins that bind to DNA in a nonspecific manner. Previous in vivo and in vitro studies have been carried out to determine how DNA is condensed by protamines. The primary factor that induces compaction is thought to be the neutralization of the negative charge on the phosphodiester backbone of DNA, which is achieved when protamines bind (11Pogany G.C.

Previous experiments have suggested that TP2 is more effective in condensing DNA than TP1 (20Baskaran R. Rao M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21039-21047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analyses of the TP2 protein sequence (23Levesque D. Veilleux S. Caron N. Boissonneault G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5143-5150Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) have also provided evidence to suggest that the TP2 protein may have two structural domains, an amino-terminal sequence that provides the protein with a specificity for binding to CG islands (8Kundu T.K. Rao M.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15626-15632Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and a carboxyl-terminal arginine- and lysine-rich segment that enhances the protein's ability to condense DNA. TP1 contains three short arginine- and lysine-rich sequences of 4–5 residues each, which may participate in its binding to DNA (23Levesque D. Veilleux S. Caron N. Boissonneault G. Biochem. Biophys.

Open table in a new tab The positions of the synthesized TP1 and TP2 fragments are shown by underlining. Using a new technique that permits the analysis of the kinetics of DNA condensation without the complications of intermolecular aggregation, we have examined TP1- and TP2-mediated DNA condensation to determine whether these proteins are capable of inducing the condensation of single, histone-free DNA molecules in vitro. The results show that the condensation rates observed for TP1 and TP2 are similar to those obtained with protamines 1 and 2. Experiments were also conducted to assess the stability of the protamine and transition protein-DNA complexes and determine whether particular basic segments of the proteins bind and participate in DNA condensation. The effect of zinc on the condensation/dissociation process induced by these transition proteins and protamines was also investigated. Hamster sperm were obtained by teasing the epididymides from sexually mature Syrian (Mesocricetus auratus) hamsters in Tris-saline and filtering the suspended sperm through 80-μm nylon gauze. The sperm basic nuclear proteins were extracted, and the two protamines were separated as described by Corzett et al.(24Corzett M. Kramer C. Blacher R. Mazrimas J. Balhorn R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The transition proteins TP1 and TP2 were extracted from testicular spermatids. Frozen Syrian hamster testes were thawed, homogenized in a Virtis homogenizer at 5000 rpm for 3 min in 0.25 m sucrose, 0.01 m Tris, pH 8, 2.5 mm magnesium chloride, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and filtered through three layers of cheese cloth. The nuclei were centrifuged at 4100 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. To remove contaminating somatic nuclei and early spermatids that were not sonication-resistant, the nuclear pellet was washed four times by sonicating it in distilled water with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuging the suspension at 3000 × g for 3 min (3Balhorn R. Weston S. Thomas C. Wyrobek A.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 150: 298-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The sonication-resistant nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.25 N HCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the proteins were extracted on ice for 1 h with occasional mixing and centrifuged at 10,500 × g for 10 min. The pellet was re-extracted for an additional hour, and the supernatants were pooled. Trichloroacteic acid was added to a final concentration of 3.5% for 1 h and then centrifuged at 4100 × gfor 15 min to remove the protamines. Additional trichloroacteic acid was added to the supernatant to increase the concentration to 25% to precipitate the transition proteins. The precipitated proteins were sedimented by centrifugation, washed with acidified acetone, and air-dried. 1M. L. Meistrich (1998) personal communication. Protamines P1 and P2 and transition proteins TP1 and TP2 were separated and purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).2 The extracted proteins were reduced with 30 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) in 3m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, for 1 h and were separated on a Hamilton PRP-1 column (200 × 7 mm, 5-μm particle size) using a linear acetonitrile gradient (20–32% buffer B at a flow rate of 2 ml/min over 20 min; buffer A = 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; buffer B = 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid). Protein elution was monitored at 214 nm. Protein purity was determined by gel electrophoresis (protamines were aminoethylated with aziridine (25Balhorn R. Gledhill B.L. Wyrobek A.J. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4074-4080Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) prior to electrophoresis). Microdensitometric scans of the gels showed TP1, TP2, P1, and P2 were enriched to >95% purity. The protein sequences of the two hamster protamines have been reported previously (24Corzett M. Kramer C. Blacher R. Mazrimas J. Balhorn R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 54: 273-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, neither the protein nor gene sequences for the Syrian hamster transition proteins TP1 and TP2 have been described in the literature. The amino acid compositions obtained for the hamster transition proteins (data not shown) confirmed their sequences are similar to their rat and mouse homologs (TableI) (23Levesque D. Veilleux S.

Three peptides corresponding to basic regions of the TP1 and TP2 mouse transition proteins (23Levesque D. Veilleux S. Caron N. Boissonneault G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) were synthesized and purified by HPLC by SynPep Corp. (Dublin, CA). The two TP1 peptides, KRKYRKSVLKSRKR and RRGKNR, were synthesized with an acetylated amino terminus and amide on the carboxyl terminus to create peptides that more accurately mimic the corresponding internal peptide sequences present in TP1. The carboxyl terminus was left unmodified in the TP2 peptide, SKRKAVRRRKRTHRAKRRSSGRRYK, and its amino terminus was acetylated to eliminate the charge on the α-amino group in the peptide. To obtain accurate values for the concentrations of the nuclear proteins used in the condensation experiments, the purified proteins were dissolved in water, known aliquots were distributed into disposable glass tubes, and the samples were lyophilized. Replicate tubes were analyzed for their amino acid content by AAA Service Laboratory (Boring, OR). The protein content of each sample was determined using the known sequence of the protamines and the amino acid compositions of the rat and mouse TP1 and TP2 proteins predicted from their gene sequences. Tube to tube variation in the aliquoted samples used for the experimental studies were found to be less than 2%. Lambda phage DNA (Invitrogen) was tagged with biotin and attached to 1-μm diameter streptavidin-coated polystyrene beads (Bangs Laboratories Inc, Fishers, IN) as described previously (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The DNA attached to beads was diluted in degassed 50% sucrose (w/v), 100 mm sodium bicarbonate pH 8, 30 mm DTT, and a sufficient quantity of YOYO-1 dye such that the dye molecule to DNA base pair ratio was less than or equal to 1:4. The same buffer, minus the YOYO-1 dye, was used for dissolving the protein samples. For experiments testing the effect of zinc (50 μm zinc chloride) on DNA condensation/decondensation, the antioxidant in the buffer used for both DNA and protein was changed from 30 mmDTT (which binds zinc) to 30 mm cysteamine. The experimental apparatus (shown in Fig.1 A) is identical to that used previously to examine the condensation of individual DNA molecules by salmine (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 32Balhorn R. Brewer L. Corzett M. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 230-234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Separate solutions of DNA molecules attached to polystyrene beads and protein were introduced into a dual-port flow cell (Fig. 1 A) at a flow velocity of ∼50 μm/s. Beads containing individual DNA molecules were trapped using an infrared laser optical trap and transported into the protein solution, where the condensation of an extended, single DNA molecule (Figs. 1 Band 2) could be observed via fluorescence microscopy. An argon-ion laser (λ = 488 nm) was used to illuminate the YOYO-1 stained DNA molecules, which could be observed for times as long as 10–15 min before photobleaching occurred. The same molecule could then be observed as it decondensed by pulling the molecule back to the DNA side of the flow cell, where there was an absence of peptide, and watching the DNA molecule re-extend.Figure 2A series of time-lapse images of a 43-μm-long DNA molecule condensed by 3.0 μmSKRKAVRRRKRTHRAKRRTSGRRYK, a synthesized TP1 fragment.

The conversion factor for the observed DNA length in μm to kb (2.53 kb/μm) was determined by measuring the length of stained lambda phage DNA (48.5 kb) extended by flow. It was measured to be 19.2 ± 0. 82 μm at a flow rate of 72 μm/s in 50% sucrose. Under these conditions the DNA was 95% extended. 3D. Stigter, personal communication. Previous experiments have shown that both salmine and bull protamine 1 induce the coiling and condensation of DNA molecules (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R.

Corzett M. Bench G. Kramer C. Lee J., IV Hud N.V. Allen M. Prieto M. Meyer-Ilse W. Brown J.T. Kirz J. Zhang X. Bradbury E.M. Maki G. Braun R.E. Breed W. Gagnon C. The Male Gamete: From Basic Knowledge to Clinical Applications. Cache River Press, Vienna, IL1999: 55-70Google Scholar). Single molecule fluorescence experiments (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) showed that condensation of DNA into a toroid appears as a distinctive fluorescent spot, starting at the free end of the molecule, which increased in brightness as more of the DNA was coiled into a toroid. The appearance of the fluorescent DNA molecules condensed by the proteins used in these experiments (Table I) were identical to those reported previously. Nevertheless it would be premature to assume that the DNA was, in fact, also condensed into toroids by TP1, TP2, and the synthesized peptides corresponding to their subdomains unless we verify this through further atomic force microscopy or electron microscopy of the condensed DNA molecules. The rate of condensation of the DNA molecule has been previously shown to be linearly related to the concentration of the protein available for binding (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Because the process of DNA condensation appears to be driven by the neutralization of the charge along the phosphodiester backbone as the basic nuclear protein or polycation binds (15Hud N.V. Downing K.H. Balhorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3581-3585Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Bloomfield V.A.

Bloomfield V.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), the rate of protein binding to the DNA molecule can be determined by monitoring the rate of shortening of the DNA molecule. For each protein, a range of concentrations (∼0–4 μm) was tested to determine whether the protein bound to the DNA molecule and condensed it. The condensation rate for 25–30 molecules was plotted as a function of protein concentration (Fig.3). The data were fit to a straight line using a least-squares analysis, and the fitted slope was proportional to the binding rate constant, k b. Dividing by the DNA binding footprint (if known) of the protein gave the binding rate constant. Footprints are known for hamster Protamine 1(10–11 bp) and Protamine 2 (15 bp) (36Bench G.S. Friz A.M. Corzett M.H. Morse D.H. Balhorn R. Cytometry. 1996; 23: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) but not TP1 or TP2. Control experiments were also conducted using bovine serum albumin (3 μm), a protein that does not bind to DNA. In these experiments the DNA molecule remained fully extended throughout the duration of the experiment, which lasted several minutes. At this same concentration, DNA condensation times for all other proteins reported in this paper were typically much less than 1 min. Experiments performed with hamster protamine 1 and protamine 2 showed that both protamines condense individual DNA molecules in vitro. These experiments, which were performed over a range of protein concentration (Table II), reveal that the two protamines appear to work equally well in condensing DNA. Protamine 2 condensation experiments, conducted with and without 50 μm zinc chloride, showed that the presence of the zinc increased the rate of protamine 2 binding to DNA nearly 3-fold.Table IIRates of condensation of individual DNA molecules induced by spermatid basic nuclear proteinsProteinCondensation ratek bConcentration rangeZincDTTμm/s·μms−1·μm−1μm50 μm30 mmProtamine 17.3 ± 0.91700 ± 2100.0 – 4.0NoYesProtamine 23.7 ± 1.4620 ± 2400.0 – 2.3NoYesProtamine 210.6 ± 2.11800 ± 3500.0 – 2.3YesNoTP14.6 ± 0.50.0 – 3.1NoYesTP24.9 ± 0.70.0 – 1.5NoYesTP26.9 ± 1.20.0 – 1.2YesNoSKRK…7.7 ± 1.50.0 – 6.5NoYesKRKY…1.4 ± 0.44 × 10−138.0 – 205.0NoYesRRGKNRNo condensation0.0 – 725.0NoYesk b is the binding rate constant. Open table in a new tab k b is the binding rate constant. Similar experiments conducted with hamster TP1 and TP2 showed that both transition proteins are capable of inducing DNA condensation. Both transition proteins condensed DNA at a rate similar to protamines 1 and 2. In contrast to the results obtained for protamine 2, the presence of 50 μm zinc chloride had no effect on the ability of TP2 to condense DNA. The dissociation rates of the protamines and transition proteins were determined by pulling a DNA molecule into a low to moderate concentration of the protein (so it would not condense too rapidly), allowing it to condense to approximately one-half its length (to avoid nonspecific binding of the DNA-protein complexes to the streptavidin-coated bead), and then pulling the incompletely condensed DNA molecule back across the buffer interface, out of the protein solution and into the buffer stream containing only DNA. Using this approach, the upper limit of the dissociation rate of protein from the DNA molecule could then be determined by measuring the rate of re-extension of the DNA molecule (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The mean and standard deviation of the dissociation rate constant, k d, for ∼10 DNA molecules is tabulated for each peptide in Table III. The dissociation constant, K d, was determined by dividing the protein dissociation rate constant, k d, by the binding rate constant, k b, or if the protein footprint was not known, the decondensation rate divided by the condensation rate. The dissociation constant standard deviation was determined by using the standard propagation of uncorrelated errors.Table IIIRate of individual DNA molecule decondensation and protein off-rates for spermatid basic nuclear proteinsProteinDecondensation ratek dK dZincDTTμm/ss−1nm50 μm30 mmTP12.3 ± 2.4 × 10−25.0 ± 5.3NoYesTP24.0 ± 2.8 × 10−30.82 ± 0.58NoYesTP23.0 ± 1.1 × 10−30.44 ± 0.18YesNoP22.0 ± 1.1 × 10−30.34 ± 0.190.54 ± 0.36NoYesP22.0 ± 0.64 × 10−30.34 ± 0.110.19 ± 0.07YesNoP11.8 ± 1.0 × 10−30.41 ± 0.230.25 ± 0.14NoYesP11.5 ± 0.65 × 10−30.34 ± 0.15YesNoSKRK…6.5 ± 2.5 × 10−30.84 ± 0.36NoYesKRKY…4.2 ± 3.13.0 ± 2.4 × 104NoYesk d is the dissociation rate constant, andK d is the dissociation constant.

Off-rates determined for both hamster protamine 1 and protamine 2 were observed to be similar (∼0.4–0.5 molecules/s) to those previously determined for salmine (0.7 molecules/s). Zinc had no effect on the rate of dissociation of either protamine. The transition protein TP1, by comparison, dissociated from DNA much more rapidly than either protamine. TP1 was measured to have a decondensation rate (the footprint is unknown) that was 10 times that of protamine 1. In contrast, the dissociation rate of TP2 from DNA was determined to be comparable to that of protamine 1 and protamine 2. As observed for protamine 2, zinc concentrations as high as 50 μm had no effect on the dissociation rate of TP2. Condensation and off-rate experiments were also conducted with synthetic peptides, a 25-residue peptide corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal end of TP2 (SKRKAVRRRKRTHRAKRRTSGRRYK) and two arginine- and lysine-rich peptides present in TP1 (KRKYRKSVLKSRKR and RRGKNR). The rate of condensation and stability of the TP2-DNA complex and the TP2(25-mer)-DNA complex, as evidenced by their off-rates, were essentially identical. This was not observed for the TP1 peptides. Only one of the peptides (KRKYRKSVLKSRKR) was observed to condense DNA, and the rate of dissociation of this peptide from DNA was observed to occur at a much higher rate than observed for the TP1 (Table III). In the present study, we have examined and compared the DNA binding kinetics of the four basic nuclear proteins (transition proteins TP1 and TP2 and protamines P1 and P2) that lead to the repackaging of chromatin during the final stages of mammalian spermatogenesis. These experiments not only show that both protamine 1 and 2 condense DNA, but they also demonstrate that protamine 2 is just as effective in condensing DNA as protamine 1. The rates of condensation achieved with hamster protamines in this study were similar to those observed previously (31Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Science. 1999; 286: 120-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) for equivalent concentrations of salmine. Binding experiments conducted in the presence of zinc show that zinc increases the rate of protamine 2 binding to DNA nearly 3-fold"

The NMR structure of the Tom20 receptor in complex with a presequence peptide revealed that the bound presequence forms an amphiphilic α-helical structure with a hydrophobic surface that interacts with the hydrophobic patch in the Tom20 groove (18Abe Y.

Chem. 1992; 5: 24193-24198Google Scholar) have reported severe effects of presequence peptides on the structural and functional integrity of mitochondrial membranes. Presequence peptides can perturb natural and artificial lipid bilayers. Addition of presequences to mitochondria results in membrane lysis, uncoupling of respiration, and dissipation of the membrane potential (14Roise D. Horvath S. Tomich J. Richards J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 22Nicolay K. Laterveer F. Heerde W. J. Bioenerg.

The mechanism of action for membrane-permeabilizing peptides is not clear, but it has been proposed that the presequence peptides induce a channel (24Lu Y. Beavis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 23: 13555-13561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (14) Google Scholar) or that the peptides themselves form a pore (25Matsuzaki K. Murase O. Fujii N. Miyajima K. Biochemistry. 1996; 3: 11361-11368Crossref Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Furthermore, peptides derived from mitochondrial presequences have been shown to be lethal towardBacillus megaterium at micromolar concentrations (26Hugosson M. Andreu D. Boman H. Glaser E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1027-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To avoid the potential harmful interactions of presequences with mitochondrial membranes, presequences cleaved off from precursor proteins inside mitochondria should be removed either by degradation inside mitochondria or by export out from the organelle. By using chemical quantities of the presequence of the ATP synthase F1β subunit, we have reported previously (27Ståhl A. Pavlov P. Szigyarto C. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) experimental evidence for a rapid degradation of the presequencein organello after in vitro import and processing. There are a few reports suggesting that chemically synthesized presequence peptides are degraded inside mitochondria (28Furuya S. Mihara K. Aimoto S. T T.O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,29Glaser S. Cumsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 25: 8817-8822Google Scholar). The synthetic presequence peptide derived from CoxIV was imported into rat mitochondria and found to be associated with the membrane; however, the authors suggested that the peptide was further translocated to the matrix and degraded over time (29Glaser S. Cumsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 25: 8817-8822Google Scholar). Another chemically synthesized presequence peptide derived from cytochrome P-450 was accumulated inside mitochondria only in the presence of a chelating agent, o-phenanthroline (28Furuya S. Mihara K. Aimoto S. T T.O. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1759-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 29Glaser S. Cumsky M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 25: 8817-8822Google Scholar, 30Ono H. Tuboi S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 5: 3188-3193Google Scholar). Subunit 9 of the bovine cytochrome bc 1 complex corresponds to the presequence of the bovine Rieske iron-sulfur protein and is the only known example of a presequence that is retained in the mitochondria and integrated as a subunit of an oligomeric membrane-bound protein complex (31Brandt U., Yu, L., Yu, C. Trumpower B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 25: 8387-8390Google Scholar). The precursor of the bovine Rieske iron-sulfur protein is targeted and assembled into thebc 1 complex before the presequence is cleaved off, presumably by the core proteins in the bc 1complex (31Brandt U., Yu, L., Yu, C.

Several ATP-dependent proteases have been identified in mitochondria that selectively remove non-assembled or misfolded polypeptides (34Kaser M. Langer T. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 11: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The quality control of the mitochondrial inner membrane is ensured by the ATP and metal- dependent AAA proteases, Yme1p, Yta10p, and Yta12p, homologues of the bacterial FtsH proteases (35Langer T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Yme1p, Yta10p, and Yta12p have been identified inNeurospora crassa, yeast, and mammalian mitochondria (36Klanner C. Prokisch H. Langer T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2858-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 37Leonhard K. Herrmann J. Stuart R. Mannhaupt G. Neupert W. Langer T.

The PIM1 protease, a homologue of the bacterial Lon protease, is located in the mitochondrial matrix and has overlapping substrate specificities with the AAA proteases (39Dyck L.V. Neupert W. Langer T. Genes Dev. 1998; 15: 1515-1524Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 40Savel'ev A. Novikova L. Kovaleva I. Luzikov V. Neupert W. Langer T. J. Biol.

Rapp W.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 37: 141-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Homologues of the bacterial ClpP protease have also been identified in the matrix of mammalian and plant mitochondria (44Halperin T. Zheng B. Itzhaki H. Clarke A. Adam Z. Plant Mol. Biol. 2001; 45: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 45Sagarra M.D. Mayo I. Marco S. Rodriguez-Vilarino S. Oliva J. Carrascosa J. Castan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 1: 819-825Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, no proteolytic function or natural substrates have been identified for ClpP in mitochondria. Both PIM1 and ClpP are ATP-dependent serine-type proteases. All the ATP-dependent proteases in mitochondria are assembled into large multimeric protein complexes and harbor not only the proteolytic but also chaperone activity (45Sagarra M.D. Mayo I. Marco S. Rodriguez-Vilarino S. Oliva J. Carrascosa J. Castan J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 1: 819-825Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 46Dyck L.V. Langer T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 30: 825-842Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Studies from our laboratory (27Ståhl A. Pavlov P. Szigyarto C. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) revealed that the presequence of F1β undergoes rapid degradation catalyzed by a matrix located protease(s). Here we have developed a three-step chromatographic procedure for isolation of a protease involved in presequence degradation. The proteolytic activity was measured by immunological detection of the F1β presequence degradation and by cleavage of synthetic fluorescent peptides. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the isolated fraction followed by ESI MS/MS and data base searches allowed identification of the presequence peptide-degrading protease in Arabidopsis thaliana data base as a novel mitochondrial metalloprotease. The identified metalloprotease contains an inverted zinc-binding motif and belongs to the pitrilysin family. Potato tuber mitochondria were isolated as described previously (47Pavlov P. Moberg P. Zhang X. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 1999; 1: 95-103Crossref Google Scholar). The mitochondria were diluted with 20 mmHEPES-KOH (pH 8.0) and 30 mm MgCl2 to a protein concentration of 8 mg/ml and sonicated for 3 × 15 s at 4 °C. Matrix was separated from membranes by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.2-μm membrane and applied to an arginine-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) affinity column equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted from the column with a linear gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl. The proteolytically active fractions were pooled, desalted on a PD-10 column, loaded onto a Mono Q HR 5/5 (Amersham Biosciences), and equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted from the Mono Q anion exchanger with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl. The active fraction was desalted on a PD-10 column and applied to a Mini Q PE 4.6/50 (Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0). Bound proteins were eluted from the Mini Q anion exchanger with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl. The active fraction eluted from the Mini Q column was desalted on PD-10 and concentrated. Samples containing proteolytic activity (150 μl, 1.8 mg/ml) were diluted to a final volume of 250 μl with a solution containing 7 m urea, 2m thiourea, 4% (w/v) CHAPS, 100 mm DTT, and 2% (v/v) carrier ampholytes (IPG buffer (pH 3–10), AmershamBiosciences) and applied to a nonlinear IPG strip, pH 3–10. The strips were allowed to rehydrate overnight at 20 °C and were then transferred to IPG strip holders and covered with paraffin oil. Proteins were focused for 1 h at 150, 500, and 1,000 V followed by a stepwise increased gradient to 8,000 V. The isoelectric focusing was then completed at a constant voltage of 8,000 V until 80,000 V-h were reached. Subsequently, the strips were first equilibrated for 15 min in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 6 m urea, 30% (v/v) glycerol, 2% SDS (w/v), and 10 mg/ml DTT and then for 10 min in the same buffer without DTT but with 25 mg/ml iodoacetamide and a trace of bromphenol blue. In the second dimension, 12% SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (48Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 15: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. Protein spots were excised from the Coomassie-stained gel and put in a 96-well PCR plate. In-gel digestion was performed according to Lanne et al. (49Lanne B. Potthast F. Höglund A. Löwenhielm H.B.V. Nyström A. Nilsson F. Dahllöf B. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 819-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications as follows: gel pieces were washed with water and 35% acetonitrile followed by dehydration in a SpeedVac vacuum evaporator. The gel plugs were digested with trypsin and extracted by addition of 1% formic acid, 1% acetonitrile. The digests were then analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer in reflector mode (Perspective Biosystems) with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. To achieve accurate mass determination, calibration was automatically performed using tryptic auto-digestion products as internal standards for each sample. The obtained mass spectra were annotated in Data Explorer, and the latest versions of NCBI nonredundant data bases were searched with the resulting peptide mass list, using the search engine MASCOT (www.matrixscience.com) or Profound (prowl.rockefeller.edu/cgi-bin/ProFound). The remaining peptide extracts were purified and concentrated on a column of Poros™ 20R packing material (Applied Biosystems). About 5 μl of sample was applied onto the column and washed with 5% formic acid, and the peptides were eluted with 2.5 μl of 65% acetonitrile and 0.5% formic acid directly into the nanospray needle (Protana A/S). The samples were analyzed by electrospray MS using a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass) equipped with a nanospray interface. The MS/MS spectra were either used to search NCBI nonredundant data bases with MASCOT directly or interpreted manually using MassLynx and Pepseq (Micromass). The precursor of the F1β subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase, pF1β, from Nicotiana plumbaginifoliawas overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The expressed protein was insoluble and present in inclusion bodies. Isolated inclusion bodies were solubilized in 70% formic acid and chemically cleaved with CNBr after methionine residues. The sample was evaporated and redissolved in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 4m urea, 1 mm DTT and loaded onto a Mini S column. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl. Fractions containing the 15-kDa N-terminal fragment of pF1β, N15pF1β, were collected. This polypeptide contains all information necessary for mitochondrial targeting, import, and processing (47Pavlov P. Moberg P. Zhang X. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 1999; 1: 95-103Crossref Google Scholar). N15pF1β (0,01 nm) was cleaved with purified MPP·bc 1 complex fromSpinacia oleracea to generate the presequence of N15pF1β. The presequence is 54 amino acid residues long, has a molecular mass of 5.7 kDa, and is referred to as N5.7pF1β-(2–54) (27Ståhl A. Pavlov P. Szigyarto C. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The presequence with a modified C-terminal carboxylic group was prepared from a mutant pF1β, in which a methionine was inserted at position +1 downstream of the MPP-processing site. The mutant protein was overexpressed in E. coli and treated with CNBr to cleave the presequence after the introduced methionine. During the cleavage reaction the methionine was converted into a homoserine lactone (hsl) group to generate N5.7pF1β-(2–54)-hsl (50Kaiser R. Metzka L. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 1: 1-8Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Purification of N5.7pF1β-(2–54)-hsl was performed as described above for N15pF1β. The proteolytic activity was determined by degradation of N5.7pF1β-(2–54) that was generated by cleavage of N15pF1β with MPP·bc 1 complex. For the proteolytic reaction, precleaved N15pF1β (0,01 nm) was incubated with mitochondrial matrix (33 μg) or isolated chromatographic fractions (30 μl) in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mm MnCl2, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of sample buffer and analyzed on 12–20% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 m urea (48Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 15: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Immunological cross-reactivity was analyzed by Western blotting using Hybond ECL that was immunodecorated with antibodies raised against the C-terminal part of the presequence (residue 38–54) of the pF1β, followed by detection with horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies. Degradation of N5.7pF1β-(2–54)-hsl was studied to assess the role of the free C terminus in proteolysis. The degradation assay contained N5.7pF1β-(2–54)-hsl (0,01 nm) and the isolated fraction from the Mini Q column (30 μl) and was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped, and products were analyzed as described for the N5.7pF1β-(2–54). To characterize the protease, degradation of synthetic peptides was also studied. The degradation assay contained 0.6 μg of the synthetic fluorescent peptides, P1 or P2 (Pep Tag Protease assay, SDS, Promega), and the isolated fraction from the Mini Q column (30 μl). Degradation was carried out at 30 °C for 30 min, and 80% glycerol was added. The samples were analyzed directly on a 1% agarose gel, and the fluorescent peptides were visualized by UV light. The effect of protease inhibitors and ATP dependence of the proteolytic activity was investigated using 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm ortho-phenanthroline, 1 mm carboxypeptidase inhibitor (catalogue number 217359, Calbiochem), or 40 units/ml apyrase. The isolated fraction from the Mini Q column was preincubated for 10 min at 4 °C with protease inhibitors before addition of substrates. Both N5.7pF1β-(2–54) and the P1 peptide were used as substrates. To test proteolytic activity in the presence of inhibitors, samples were incubated and analyzed as described before. The polypeptide content of the mitochondrial matrix and isolated chromatographic fractions was analyzed by 12–20% SDS-PAGE in the presence of 4 murea (48Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 15: 680-685Crossref Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Proteins were stained with silver. In order to assay degradation of mitochondrial presequences, we have prepared chemical amounts of a truncated precursor derived from the overexpressed full-length precursor of the F1β (pF1β) subunit of the ATP synthase. The 15-kDa N-terminal fragment of pF1β, designated as N15pF1β, consisted of a 53-amino acid long presequence and the first 82 amino acids of the mature form and was detected by antibodies directed against the C-terminal part of the presequence (47Pavlov P. Moberg P. Zhang X. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 1999; 1: 95-103Crossref Google Scholar). The precursor protein was incubated with the isolated spinach MPP·bc 1complex (51Eriksson A.C. Sjöling S. Glaser E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1186: 221-231Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to generate the presequence peptide of 5.7 kDa, N5.7pF1β-(2–54) (Fig.1 B, lane 1). The proteolytic activity was found to be localized to the matrix of mitochondria (27Ståhl A. Pavlov P. Szigyarto C. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We have developed a three-step procedure for purification of a protease involved in presequence degradation. The procedure was based on affinity chromatography, followed by anion exchange chromatography. Mitochondrial matrix from S. tuberosum was applied to an affinity column, arginine-Sepharose. The majority of proteins did not bind to the column (flow-through). Bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.5m NaCl and recovered in three protein peaks, A1 and A2 at 0.1–0.25 m NaCl and A3 at 0.25–0.35 m NaCl (Fig. 1 A). When the isolated fractions were analyzed for proteolytic activity using N5.7pF1β-(2–54) (Fig. 1 B), the proteolytic activity was found in fractions A1 and A2 (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 5). The protein content of eluted fractions analyzed by SDS-PAGE revealed a similar polypeptide pattern in fractions A1 and A2 (not shown) that were pooled, desalted, and loaded onto a Mono Q column. Proteins eluted from the Mono Q with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl (Fig.2 A, upper panel) exhibited two protein peaks, MoQ1 and MoQ2. The proteolytic activity was eluted at 225–275 mm NaCl in fraction MoQ1 (Fig.2 B, lane 3). SDS-PAGE of MoQ1 revealed a major band of 23 kDa as well as several other bands in the high molecular mass region (Fig. 2 C). MALDI-TOF analysis identified the 23 kDa as Mn2+-containing superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD). In order to separate Mn-SOD from potential protease candidates, an anion exchanger, Mini Q, with a higher resolution capacity than Mono Q was used in the purification procedure. Proteins bound to the Mini Q were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl and collected in two protein fractions MiQ1 and MiQ2 (Fig. 2 A,lower panel). The proteolytic activity was completely eluted at 310–340 mm NaCl and found only in fraction MiQ2 (Fig. 2 C, lane 6). As revealed by SDS-PAGE in one dimension, fraction MiQ1 contained the 23-kDa Mn-SOD band (Fig.2 C), whereas MiQ2 contained 7 polypeptides: 2 high molecular mass proteins (110 and 108 kDa), 4 proteins in the range of 55–66 kDa (66, 65, 55, and 54 kDa), and residual amounts of Mn-SOD (23 kDa) (Fig.2 C). No proteolytic fragments of the presequence of pF1β were detected after incubation with isolated chromatographic fractions (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4and 5; Fig. 2 B, lanes 3 and 6). In order to confirm complete degradation of the presequence, we used N5.7pF1β-(2–54) that was labeled with sulfosuccinimidyl biotin at lysine residues and detected using the avidin peroxidase system (27Ståhl A. Pavlov P. Szigyarto C. Glaser E. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 703-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). There are 2 lysine residues in the presequence of F1β at positions 32 and 44. Experiments with the sulfosuccinimidyl biotin-labeled F1β presequence have not revealed any presequence fragments indicating complete degradation of the presequence (not shown).Figure 2Ion exchange chromatography. A, elution profile from Mono Q (upper panel) and Mini Q (lower panel). Active fractions from arginine-Sepharose were applied to Mono Q. Bound proteins were eluted from the anion exchanger with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 mNaCl (fractions MoQ1 and MoQ2). The proteolytically active fraction from Mono Q was desalted and loaded onto Mini Q. Bound proteins were eluted from the anion exchanger with a linear gradient of 0–0.4 m NaCl (fractions MiQ1and MiQ2). The solid line represents the absorbance at 280 nm, and the dashed line represents the NaCl gradient. B, degradation of the presequence of pF1β, N5.7pF1β-(2–54), with fractions from ion exchange chromatography. N5.7pF1β-(2–54) was obtained after cleavage of N15pF1β with MPP/bc 1 (lane 1) and further incubated with matrix (lane 2), or fractions MoQ1 (lane 3), MoQ2 (lane 4), MiQ1 (lane 5), and MiQ2 (lane 6) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” C, SDS-PAGE of fractions eluted from anion exchangers. Proteins were stained with silver.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the protease among the polypeptides in the MiQ2 fraction, two-dimensional gels followed by MALDI-TOF and ESI-MS/MS were applied. The two-dimensional gel of the MiQ2 fraction revealed nine individual protein spots; two high molecular mass proteins (105 and 91 kDa), five proteins in the range of 55–70 kDa, a 35-kDa protein, and Mn-SOD (23 kDa) (Fig.3). The molecular masses of proteins separated in one or two dimensions differ slightly from each other. This is due to the presence of urea in the one-dimensional SDS-PAGE system. MALDI-TOF followed by data base search allowed identification of the proteins in the 55–70-kDa range as the F1α and F1β subunits of ATP synthase (54 and 55 kDa), the flavoprotein from succinate dehydrogenase (66 kDa), dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (57 kDa), and mitochondrial Hsp70 (69 kDa) (TableI). The F1α and F1β subunits are a part of the extramembranous catalytic core of the membrane-bound ATP synthase (52Stock D. Leslie A. Walke"

Here we describe an unexpected magnetic effect on crystal shape, in which the direction of the crystal's axes are swapped and the shape changes when a magnetic field is applied; this in turn induces curious memory effects in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility. Ironically, this phenomenon occurs in one of the most well-studied two-dimensional antiferromagnets, La(2-x)Sr(x)CuO(4)."

https://openalex.org/W2076035242,"The intestinal mucosa is a rapidly-renewing tissue characterized by cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventual apoptosis with progression up the vertical gut axis. The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase by specific chemical inhibitors or overexpression of the lipid phosphatase PTEN enhances enterocyte-like differentiation in human colon cancer cell models of intestinal differentiation. In this report, we examined the role of PI 3-kinase inhibition in the regulation of apoptotic gene expression in human colon cancer cell lines HT29, HCT-116, and Caco-2. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with the chemical inhibitor wortmannin increased TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; Apo2) mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, overexpression of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, an antagonist of PI 3-kinase signaling, resulted in the increased expression of TRAIL. Activation of PI 3-kinase by pretreatment with IGF-1, a gut trophic factor, markedly attenuated the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Moreover, overexpression of active Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, or inhibition of GSK-3, a downstream target of active Akt, completely blocked the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Consistent with findings that TRAIL is induced by agents that enhance intestinal cell differentiation, TRAIL expression was specifically localized to the differentiated cells of the colon and small bowel. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TRAIL increased DNA fragmentation of HCT-116 cells, demonstrating the functional activity of TRAIL induction. Taken together, our findings demonstrate induction of the TRAIL by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in colon cancer cell lines. These results identify TRAIL, a novel TNF family member, as a downstream target of the PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 pathway and may have important implications for better understanding the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in intestinal cell homeostasis. The intestinal mucosa is a rapidly-renewing tissue characterized by cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventual apoptosis with progression up the vertical gut axis. The inhibition of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase by specific chemical inhibitors or overexpression of the lipid phosphatase PTEN enhances enterocyte-like differentiation in human colon cancer cell models of intestinal differentiation.

Inhibition of PI 3-kinase with the chemical inhibitor wortmannin increased TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; Apo2) mRNA and protein expression. Similarly, overexpression of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, an antagonist of PI 3-kinase signaling, resulted in the increased expression of TRAIL. Activation of PI 3-kinase by pretreatment with IGF-1, a gut trophic factor, markedly attenuated the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Moreover, overexpression of active Akt, a downstream target of PI 3-kinase, or inhibition of GSK-3, a downstream target of active Akt, completely blocked the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Consistent with findings that TRAIL is induced by agents that enhance intestinal cell differentiation, TRAIL expression was specifically localized to the differentiated cells of the colon and small bowel. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of TRAIL increased DNA fragmentation of HCT-116 cells, demonstrating the functional activity of TRAIL induction. Taken together, our findings demonstrate induction of the TRAIL by inhibition of PI 3-kinase in colon cancer cell lines. These results identify TRAIL, a novel TNF family member, as a downstream target of the PI 3-kinase/Akt/GSK-3 pathway and may have important implications for better understanding the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in intestinal cell homeostasis. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase tumor necrosis factor TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand glycogen-synthase kinase-3 insulin-like growth factor 1 phosphatase and tensin homologue, deleted on chromosome 10 glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase multiplicity of infection phosphate-buffered saline plaque-forming unit fluorescein isothiocyanate The epithelium of the mammalian intestine is a dynamic and continuously renewing tissue serving a number of critical physiologic functions which, depending upon the location along the cephalocaudal gut axis, include digestion and nutrient absorption, barrier and immune functions, and secretion (1Podolsky D.K. Babyatsky M.W. Yamada T. Textbook of Gastroenterology. Lippincott, Philadelphia, PA1995: 546-577Google Scholar). The intestinal mucosa is characterized by a remarkably efficient and highly regimented progression of proliferation and differentiation with progression of cells up the crypt axis of the colon and the crypt-villus axis of the small bowel (2Cheng H. Leblond C.P. Am. J. Anat. 1974; 141: 461-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Proliferating cells are localized to the lower crypt fractions with differentiated cells localized to the upper half of the colon and the villus fraction of the small bowel. Over a 3–5-day period, the differentiated colonocytes and enterocytes are extruded into the intestinal lumen (3Pritchard D.M. Watson A.J. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 72: 149-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 4Potten C.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G253-G257PubMed Google Scholar). The cellular mechanisms triggering the differentiation and subsequent extrusion of these epithelial cells are not entirely known. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase),1 a ubiquitous lipid kinase that is involved in receptor signal transduction through tyrosine kinase receptors, is composed of a regulatory subunit (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110) (5Carpenter C.L.

PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositol 4-phosphate and phosphoinositol 4,5-phosphate at the D3 position and activates various downstream elements including Akt/protein kinase B (PKB). PI 3-kinase regulates a number of important cellular processes such as cellular growth and transformation, membrane ruffling, actin rearrangement, vesicular trafficking, and cell survival. Promotion of cell survival by the activation of PI 3-kinase/Akt occurs by the inhibition of proapoptotic signals and the induction of survival signals (7Roche S. Koegl M. Courtneidge S.A. Proc. Natl.

Conversely, the inhibition of PI 3-kinase/Akt results in cell cycle arrest and differentiation in certain cell types, such as the human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and Caco-2 (12Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is an Akt substrate shown to be inhibited upon phosphorylation by Akt (13Zheng W.H. Kar S. Quirion R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39152-39158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). GSK-3, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, has been implicated in multiple biological processes by phosphorylation of a broad range of substrates, including several transcription factors such as c-Myc, c-Jun, and c-Myb and the translation factor eIF2B (14Ali A.

Acta. 1992; 1114: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). As a downstream target of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway, GSK-3 activity suppresses cell proliferation and survival (16Kane L.P.

The tumor suppressor genePTEN (for Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10; also called MMAC1 orTEP1) encodes a 403-amino acid phosphatase that antagonizes the activity of PI 3-kinase by dephosphorylating the D3-phosphate group of lipid second messengers, thus serving as a negative regulator of the PI 3-kinase pathway (18Cantley L.C. Neel B.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4240-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar). This effect of PTEN inhibits downstream functions mediated by the PI 3-kinase pathway, such as activation of Akt/PKB, cell survival, and cell proliferation (19Maehama T. Dixon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13375-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar, 20Sun H. Lesche R., Li, D.M. Liliental J. Zhang H. Gao J. Gavrilova N. Mueller B. Liu X. Wu H. Proc.

Members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family interact with their cell surface receptors to directly engage the cellular apoptotic machinery (22Nagata S.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL; also called Apo-2 ligand), a novel member of the TNF family, is a type II membrane protein identified based on homology to the extracellular domains of TNF and FasL (CD95L) (24Pitti R.M.

Unlike TNF and FasL, TRAIL is expressed in a variety of cell types and is capable of inducing apoptosis in normal and neoplastic cells (26Walczak H. Miller R.E. Ariail K. Gliniak B. Griffith T.S. Kubin M. Chin W. Jones J. Woodward A., Le, T. Smith C. Smolak P. Goodwin R.G. Rauch C.T. Schuh J.C. Lynch D.H. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (2236) Google Scholar, 27Ashkenazi A.

Invest. 1999; 104: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). In addition, TRAIL blockade results in hyperproliferation of synovial cells and lymphocytes, whereas TRAIL inhibits DNA synthesis in lymphocytes by blocking cell cycle progression (28Song K. Chen Y. Goke R. Wilmen A. Seidel C. Goke A. Hilliard B. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1095-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Therefore, TRAIL appears to play important roles in cell proliferation and survival; however, little is known regarding the signaling pathways that regulate TRAIL expression. Recently, we have shown that inhibition of PI 3-kinase, using the chemical inhibitor wortmannin or PTEN overexpression significantly enhances enterocyte-like differentiation of the HT29 and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells (12Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M.

The purpose of our present study was to identify potential downstream targets of PI 3-kinase inhibition, which may contribute to intestinal cell differentiation and/or apoptosis. Here, we report that the PI 3-kinase signaling pathway negatively regulates TRAIL expression in human colon cancer cell lines. The induction of TRAIL expression by PI 3-kinase inhibition was demonstrated with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin or by the constitutive overexpression of the physiological antagonist, PTEN. Activation of PI 3-kinase by insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) markedly attenuated the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Furthermore, overexpression of Akt or inhibition of GSK-3 completely blocked the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin. Thus, our study identifies the TRAIL gene as a novel downstream target of PI 3-kinase inhibition.

Total RNA was isolated using Ultraspec RNA (Biotecx Laboratories, Houston, TX). Ribonuclease (RNase) protection experiments were performed using the RPA-III kit from Ambion. Immobilon-P nylon membranes for Western blots were purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA), and x-ray film was purchased from Eastman Kodak (Rochester, NY). The enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system for Western immunoblot analysis was from Amersham Biosciences. Tissue culture media and RT-PCR reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. All other reagents were of molecular biology grade and purchased from either Sigma or Amresco (Solon, OH). The human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and HCT-116 (ATCC; Manassas, VA) were maintained in McCoy's 5A supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Caco-2 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal calf serum. Wortmannin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). In all experiments, the effects of wortmannin were compared with cells treated with vehicle (i.e.Me2SO at a concentration less than 0.05%). Cells were infected with adenovirus vectors AdCA-PTEN and AxCA-Akt at 10 plaque-forming units (pfu)/cell as described previously (25Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K.

RNA was isolated from cells using Ultraspec RNA reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. A 32P-labeled antisense RNA probe was prepared using the Human Apoptosis hAPO-3c Template Set (BD Pharmingen), which measures multiple mRNA species and RNA analyzed as we have previously described (39Dong Z. Wang X. Evers B.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G1139-G1147PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA (40 μg) was run in 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gels and transferred to supported nitrocellulose as previously described (40Evers B.M. Zhou Z. Celano P. Li J. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 2822-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized to a random-primed 32P-labeled TRAIL cDNA probe overnight at 43 °C and then washed two times at room temperature with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS and two times at 43 °C for 15 min with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS. The human TRAIL cDNA probe was synthesized as previously described (41Wang Q., Ji, Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) by RT-PCR using the following primers: 5′-CTTCACAGTGCTCCTGCAGT-3′, which spans nucleotides 150–169 of the human TRAIL cDNA sequence, and 5′-TTAGCCAACTAAAAAGGCCCC-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 913–933 of the cDNA sequence. The PCR fragment was sequenced and confirmed to be the correct sequence for human TRAIL. Blots were stripped and reprobed with GAPDH to ensure equal loading. Signals were detected by autoradiography. A 5-μg aliquot of total RNA was reverse transcribed with Maloney Murine Leukemia Virus (M-MLV) reverse transcriptase, and the resulting cDNA was combined with each primer pair and PCR reagents in a final reaction volume of 50 μl. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles (95 °C melting temperature for 45 s; 60 °C annealing temperature for 45 s; 72 °C extension temperature for 1 min). The following two primers were synthesized: 5′-CTTCACAGTGCTCCTGCAGT-3′, which spans nucleotides 150–169 of the human TRAIL cDNA sequence, and 5′-TTAGCCAACTAAAAAGGCCCC-3′, which is complementary to nucleotides 913–933 of the cDNA sequence. GAPDH was amplified to assess equal loading using the PCR primers that have been described previously (41Wang Q., Ji, Y. Wang X. Evers B.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Western immunoblot analyses were performed as described previously (42Wang Q. Ding Q. Dong Z. Ehlers R.A. Evers B.M. Anticancer Res. 2000; 20: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were lysed with TNN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 25 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) at 4 °C for 30 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 30 min at 4 °C) and protein concentrations determined using the method of Bradford (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217450) Google Scholar). Briefly, total protein (100 μg) was resolved on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to immobilon-P nylon membranes. Filters were incubated overnight at 4 °C in blotting solution (Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dried milk and 0.1% Tween 20). Akt, phosphorylated Akt, PTEN, β-actin, and phospho-GSK-3α/β were detected with specific antibodies to these proteins following blotting with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized using ECL detection. HT29 cells were incubated with wortmannin or vehicle (i.e. Me2SO). 5 × 105 cells in a final volume of 100 μl of PBS were incubated with l μg of RIK-2 antibody or isotype control (mouse IgG) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed twice, and resuspended in 100 μl of PBS. For secondary staining, cells were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C in the dark with 1 μg of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS; specific fluorescence was measured using a FACScan. HT29 cells were seeded onto sterile glass coverslips in 60-mm dishes and cultured for 16–24 h before treatment. Cells were treated with wortmannin (500 nm) or Me2SO at 37 °C for 4 h. Cells were washed in PBS, fixed in cold methanol for 5 min, and washed in three changes of PBS followed by a solution of 10% normal goat serum (Sigma). After washing, cells were then incubated with the TRAIL receptor, TRAIL-R2 (also known as DR5), fused with human FC (TRAIL-R2:FC) (1 μg/ml diluted in PBS with 1.5% normal goat serum) for 60 min. After washing with PBS, cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-human FC antibody (2 μg/ml) in PBS with 1.5% normal goat serum for 45 min. After three final washes, the slides were viewed with a fluorescence and phase contrast microscope. Cells were plated in 96-well plates 24 h before treatment. After treatment, DNA fragmentation was evaluated by examination of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragments (mono- and oligonucleosomes) using a Cell death Detection ELISAPlus kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of normal human colon and small bowel were used. Sections (5-μm thick) were fixed to the slide by incubation in a dry oven at 58 °C for 30 min, and then sequentially transferred to xylene (5 min, 2 changes), 100% ethanol (3 min, 2 changes), 95% ethanol (3 min, 2 changes) and rinsed with deionized water. A standard heat-induced epitope retrieval procedure (20 min, 98 °C) was employed by placing slides in commercially available retrieval solution (Target Retrieval Solution, pH 6.0; DAKO, Carpinteria, CA). Slides were allowed to cool at room temperature and rinsed twice with deionized water. Endogenous peroxidase was blocked by placing slides in 3% H2O2/methanol block solution for 10 min, washed with deionized water, and placed in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min. Slides were incubated at room temperature with primary mouse monoclonal anti-human TRAIL antibody (1:400, BD Pharmingen, cat. 556468) for 30 min. Avidin-biotin peroxidase complex amplification and detection system (LSAB2, DAKO) with diaminobenzidine as chromagen was used. All steps were performed on the automated stainer (DAKO). Negative controls (including no primary antibody or isotype matched mouse IgG) were used in each assessment. Previously, we have shown that inhibition of PI 3-kinase augments the enterocyte-like differentiation of the HT29 and Caco-2 human colon cancer cells (12Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). These cells undergo differentiation to a small bowel-like phenotype as noted by the induction of brush border enzymes and the presence of microvilli and have been extensively utilized to address mechanistic questions regarding intestinal differentiation (29Heerdt B.G.

In this study, we have investigated potential downstream targets of PI 3-kinase inhibition in these intestinal-derived cell lines. HT29 cells were treated for 4 h with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (250 nm), or vehicle control and then the RNA was analyzed by an RNase protection analysis using a multiprobe template (hAPO-3c; BD Pharmingen), which assesses the expression of eleven different genes that contribute to the apoptotic pathway in cells (e.g.TRAIL, Fas, FasL, and TRAIL receptors); L32 and GAPDH are included to ensure equality of loading (Fig.1 A). Wortmannin treatment resulted in the induction of TRAIL gene expression compared with control cells treated with vehicle (i.e. Me2SO) with no marked change in the expression of the other apoptotic-related genes contained in this probe set. To confirm the induction of TRAIL by wortmannin, HT29 cells were treated for 4 h with different concentrations of wortmannin (2.5 nm to 1 μm) and Northern blot analysis performed using a human TRAIL cDNA probe (Fig. 1 B). Wortmannin treatment increased TRAIL mRNA levels in a dose-dependent fashion with TRAIL induction noted using a dosage of only 2.5 nm. To next assess the time course for TRAIL mRNA induction, HT29 cells were treated with wortmannin (250 nm) for 0.5–8 h (Fig. 1 C). Induction of TRAIL mRNA was noted at 2 h after wortmannin treatment with further increases demonstrated at 4 and 8 h. To determine whether TRAIL induction requires RNA transcription or new protein synthesis, HT29 cells were treated with either actinomycin D (10 μg/ml), which inhibits transcription, or cycloheximide (9 μm), which inhibits protein synthesis, in combination with wortmannin (250 nm) for 4 h, total RNA was extracted and Northern blot analysis was performed (Fig.1 D). Induction of TRAIL by wortmannin was completely blocked by actinomycin D. In contrast, treatment with cycloheximide had no effect on TRAIL induction. Therefore, these findings suggest that TRAIL induction by PI 3-kinase inhibition is regulated at the level of transcription and is not dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Our findings using the HT29 human colon cancer cell line demonstrate induction of TRAIL expression associated with PI 3-kinase inhibition, which we have previously shown enhances the differentiation of the human colon cancer cell lines HT29 and Caco-2 (12Wang Q. Wang X. Hernandez A. Kim S. Evers B.M. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1381-1392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To determine the location of TRAIL expression in vivo, sections of normal small bowel and colon were obtained from adult patients and analyzed (Fig. 1 E). Interestingly, TRAIL expression was specifically localized to the intestinal cells in the differentiated fractions of the intestinal mucosa. That is, intense staining for TRAIL was located in upper crypt portion of the colon (Fig. 1 E, left panel) and the villus fraction of the jejunum (Fig. 1 E,right panel). Little to no staining of TRAIL was noted in the lower crypt of the colon or crypt cells of the jejunum. Therefore, these findings confirm the induction of TRAIL expression specifically in the more differentiated portions of the intestinal mucosa thus further suggesting the association of TRAIL induction in the HT29 cells with treatments that result in a more differentiated phenotype. TRAIL is a type II membrane protein; therefore, we next assessed whether PI 3-kinase inhibition affects TRAIL protein expression on HT29 cells using both flow cytometry and immunofluorescence (Fig. 2). HT29 cells were treated with wortmannin (500 nm) for 4 h and then assessed by flow cytometry using an anti-TRAIL antibody (RIK2) (35Kayagaki N. Yamaguchi N. Nakayama M. Kawasaki A. Akiba H. Okumura K. Yagita H. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2639-2647PubMed Google Scholar). TRAIL expression was detected on the surface of HT29 cell"
https://openalex.org/W2100403113,"The ERK pathway is typically associated with activation of the EGF receptor and has been shown to play a major role in promoting several tumor phenotypes. An analogous signaling module, the JNK pathway, has not been shown to be consistently activated by the EGF receptor but is instead more uniformly stimulated by cellular stresses and cytokines. The function of the JNK pathway in primary tumors is unclear as it has been implicated in both promoting apoptosis and cell growth in vitro, which may be a reflection of the cell lines chosen. Primary human brain tumors frequently show overexpression of the EGF receptor. To clarify the role of JNK in tumorigenesis, we have investigated the role of JNK in a large panel of primary human brain tumors and tumor derived cell lines. Here we present evidence that JNK has a major role in promoting tumorigenesis both in vivo and in vitro. Western blot analysis demonstrated that 86% (18 of 21) of primary brain tumors showed evidence of JNK activation but only 38% (8 of 21) showed evidence of ERK activation. Kinase assays revealed that 77% of brain tumor cell lines activated JNK in response to EGF (7 of 13) or had high levels of basal activity (3 of 13), whereas none of six normal cell lines analysed, including astrocytes, had these properties. Of several growth factors examined, EGF produced the highest level of JNK induction in tumor cell lines and the duration of activation was greater than that seen for ERK. Expression of a dominant-negative (dn) form of JNK potently inhibited EGF mediated anchorage independent growth and protection from cell death in two glial tumor cell lines. These findings demonstrate that enhanced JNK activation is frequently found in primary brain tumors and that this activation contributes to phenotypes related to transformation."

Here we describe the generation, high level expression and characterization of a recombinant B-domain-deleted porcine factor VIII molecule. Recombinant B-domain-deleted porcine factor VIII expression levels are 10- to 14-fold greater than recombinant B-domain-deleted human factor VIII levels by transient and stable expression in multiple cell lines. Peak expression of 140 units·106cells−1·24 h−1 was observed from a baby hamster kidney-derived cell line stably expressing recombinant porcine factor VIII. Factor VIII expression was performed in serum-free culture medium and in the absence of exogenous von Willebrand factor, thus greatly simplifying protein purification. Real time reverse transcription–PCR analysis demonstrated that the differences in protein production were not caused by differences in steady-state factor VIII mRNA levels. The identification of sequence(s) in porcine factor VIII responsible for high level expression may lead to a better understanding of the mechanisms that limit factor VIII expression.

Mutations in the fVIII gene that result in decreased or defective fVIII protein give rise to the genetic disease, hemophilia A, which is phenotypically characterized by recurrent bleeding episodes. Treatment of hemophilia A entails intravenous infusion of either human plasma-derived or recombinant fVIII material. Approximately 25% of all hemophilia A patients treated with fVIII products develop antibodies that inhibit fVIII activity and limit treatment efficacy (1Lusher J.M. Arkin S. Abildgaard C.F. Schwartz R.S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 453-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Patients with fVIII-inhibitory antibodies can be treated using porcine plasma-derived fVIII products, which generally display low cross-reactivity with the human fVIII antibodies (2Gatti L. Mannucci P.M. Thromb. Haemost. 1984; 51: 379-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Hay C.R. Lozier J.N. Lee C.A. Laffan M. Tradati F. Santagostino E. Ciavarella N. Schiavoni M. Fukui H. Yoshioka A. Teitel J. Mannucci P.M. Kasper C.K. Thromb. Haemost. 1996; 75: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Currently there is not a recombinant porcine fVIII product available for clinical use. Since the introduction of recombinant fVIII for the treatment of hemophilia A, commercial suppliers have struggled to keep up with high patient demand (4Garber K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The shortage of recombinant fVIII material has precluded prophylactic treatment of severely affected patients, limited the implementation of immune-tolerance regimens, and kept treatment costs high. Unfortunately, fVIII is expressed and recovered at low levels in the heterologous mammalian cell culture systems used for commercial manufacture. The importance of this problem has fueled significant research efforts to overcome the low fVIII expression barrier, and several basic mechanisms have been identified that limit fVIII expression (for review, see Kaufman et al. (5Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Tagliavacca L. Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8 Suppl. 2: S3-S14PubMed Google Scholar)) Despite these findings, fVIII expression levels remain low, and a product shortage persists. The porcine fVIII cDNA sequence has been reported and shown to encode the homology-defined internal protein domain structure, A1-A2-B-ap-A3-C1-C2 (6Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Lollar P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Toole J.J. Pittman D.D. Orr E.C. Murtha P. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5939-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Porcine fVIII shares 83% amino acid identity with human fVIII outside of the 2.7-kb B-domain, which has no ascribed function. Additionally, B-domain deletion has been shown to increase fVIII protein production in heterologous systems (7Toole J.J. Pittman D.D. Orr E.C. Murtha P. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5939-5942Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 8Pittman D.D. Alderman E.M. Tomkinson K.N. Wang J.H. Giles A.R. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we compared recombinant B-domain-deleted porcine fVIII (rp-fVIII OL) to recombinant B-domain-deleted human fVIII (rh-fVIII SQ) in terms of protein expression, purification, and activity. Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, fetal bovine serum, penicillin, streptomycin, DMEM:F-12 medium, and AIM V culture medium were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cell transfections were performed using Lipofectin (for baby hamster kidney-derived (BHK-M) cells) or LipofectAMINE (for COS-7 cells) (Invitrogen). Antibiotic selection was done using geneticin (Invitrogen). Transient transfections were controlled for transfection efficiency using the RL-CMV vector and Dual-Luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Clotting times were measured using a STart coagulation instrument (Diagnostica Stago, Asnieres, France). Citrated fVIII-deficient plasma and normal pooled human plasma (FACT) were purchased from George King Biomedical (Overland Park, KS). Activated partial thromboplastin reagent was purchased from Organon Teknika (Durham, NC). Human vWf was isolated as described previously (9Lollar P. Hill-Eubanks D.C. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10451-10455Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA was purified from cultured cells using TriReagent (Sigma). In vitro-transcribed fVIII RNA standards were generated using the mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). fVIII RNA quantitation was performed using the ABI 7000 Sequence Detection System and the ABI SYBR Green RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. BrightStar nylon membrane was purchased from Ambion. Rh-fVIII SQ was created by cloning the human fVIII cDNA into the mammalian expression vector ReNeo (10Barrow R.T. Healey J.F. Jacquemin M.G. Saint-Remy J.M. Lollar P. Blood. 2001; 97: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and using splicing-by-overlap extension mutagenesis (11Horton R.M. Cai Z.L., Ho, S.N. Pease L.R. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 528-535PubMed Google Scholar) to modify the nucleotide sequence between the A2 and A3 domains to encode a SFSQNPPVLKRHQR linker. This amino acid sequence includes the RHQR recognition sequence for PACE/furin processing (12Seidah N.G. Chretien M. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The cloning and sequencing of the porcine fVIII cDNA has been described previously (6Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Lollar P. Blood. 1996; 88: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two B-domain-deleted fVIII expression constructs were created by ligation of the porcine fVIII cDNA into the ReNeo vector and using splicing-by-overlap extension mutagenesis to modify the nucleotide sequence between the A2 and A3 domains. One vector contains the identical human SQ linker amino acid sequence described above (designated rp-fVIII SQ), and the second vector contains a similar porcine-derived sequence SFAQNSRPPSASAPKPPVLRRHQR (designated rp-fVIII OL). Both constructs contain the RHQR PACE/furin recognition sequence. Expression data for rp-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL were similar; thus, only data for rp-fVIII OL are presented. For all fVIII-expression experiments, cells were rinsed twice with Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h prior to assaying fVIII activity. Activity was measured using the activated partial thromboplastin reagent-based one-stage coagulation assay. Briefly, 5 μl of sample or standard was added to 50 μl of fVIII-deficient plasma, followed by addition of 50 μl of activated partial thromboplastin reagent reagent and incubation for 3 min at 37 °C. Fifty microliters of 20 mm CaCl2 was added to initiate the reaction, and the time required to develop a fibrin clot was measured viscometrically. Standard curves were generated using several dilutions of FACT and analyzed by linear regression analysis of the clotting time versus the logarithm of the reciprocal plasma dilution. For determination of fVIII activity, samples were diluted in HEPES-buffered saline (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) to a concentration within the range of the standard curve. Dilutions of purified rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL within the range used to generate the standard curves produced lines parallel to that obtained for normal pooled human plasma on semilogarithmic plots (data not shown). Determination of the activation quotient (13Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) for rp-fVIII OL was done using a two-stage coagulation assay. Fifty microliters each of fVIII-deficient plasma and activated partial thromboplastin reagent were dispensed into a pre-warmed cuvette and incubated at 37 °C for 180 s. At 140 s, 4 units/ml porcine thrombin was added to the conditioned medium to activate rp-fVIII OL. At 160 s, the activated rp-fVIII OL was diluted from 40- to 80-fold and added to the cuvette containing fVIII-deficient plasma and activated partial thromboplastin reagent. To initiate the clotting time, 50 μl of 20 mm CaCl2 was added to the cuvette. Clotting times were compared with a standard curve as described above. The activation quotient is defined as the ratio of fVIII activity measured by the two-stage assay divided by the activity measured by the one-stage coagulation assay. fVIII activity is expressed as units·106 cells−1·24 h−1. An estimate of 100,000 cells/cm2 was used to calculate the fVIII expression values presented. The number of BHK-M cells/cm2 was determined experimentally to be 99,300 ± 8,900 cells/cm2 in five independent measurements. The specific activity of individual preparations of rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ was determined by taking the weighted number average of the specific activities measured from the peak fractions collected. Fractions demonstrating absorbance at 280 nm below 0.08 or an activation quotient of less than 20 were excluded. The mean values ± S.D. of the specific activities for all rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ preparations are presented. COS-7 cells were grown to 70–80% confluence in 2-cm2 wells containing 1 ml of DMEM:F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with a 2000:1 mass ratio of fVIII (rp-fVIII OL or rh-fVIII SQ) plasmid:luciferase plasmid DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were rinsed twice with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and 0.5 ml of serum-free medium was added to each well. Cells were cultured 24 h before the conditioned medium was harvested and fVIII activity was measured. BHK-M cells (14Funk W.D. MacGillivray R.T. Mason A.B. Brown S.A. Woodworth R.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1654-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) were transfected with either rp-fVIII OL or rh-fVIII SQ and cultured in the presence of DMEM:F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml geneticin for 10 days. Between 72 and 84 geneticin-resistant clones were initially screened for fVIII production. The 24 clones exhibiting the highest level of fVIII activity were divided into individual 2-cm2 wells and grown to greater than 80% confluence prior to being switched to 0.5 ml of serum-free medium. Twenty-four hours later, fVIII activity in the conditioned medium was determined by one-stage coagulation assay. The top three fVIII-expressing clones were then divided into 75-cm2flasks and grown to 90–95% confluence before being switched to 25 ml of serum-free medium. After 24 h, the conditioned medium was replaced with 25 ml of fresh serum-free medium and cultured for an additional 24 h. This process was repeated a third time to measure fVIII production between 48 and 72 h. Harvested medium from each time point was assayed for fVIII activity as described above. Total RNA was extracted from fVIII-expressing cell lines using TriReagent following the manufacturer's instructions. RNA concentrations were determined by absorbance at 260 nm (A 260) in H2O. RNA standards, used for absolute quantitation of fVIII transcripts by real time RT-PCR, were generated using T7 polymerase-mediated in vitro transcription of rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL cDNAs cloned into pBluescript II KS− (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In vitro-transcribed RNA was treated with DNase I for removal of plasmid DNA. Purified RNA standards were quantitated spectrophotometrically by A 260 and stored at −70 °C in individual aliquots at a concentration of 1010 transcripts/μl. Amplification kinetics of human and porcine fVIII transcripts were found to be similar by performing RT-PCR reactions using serial dilutions of rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL (102-107 transcripts/reaction) as template (data not shown). All data presented were calculated using in vitro-transcribed rh-fVIII SQ RNA standards. Oligonucleotide primers used for RT-PCR assays were located in the fVIII sequence encoding the A2 domain. The oligonucleotide sequences are as follows: forward primer, 5′-ATGCACAGCATCAATGGCTAT-3′ and reverse primer, 5′-GTGAGTGTGTCTTCATAGAC-3′, and are located at positions 2047–2067 and 2194–2213 of the human fVIII cDNA sequence (15Toole J.J. Knopf J.L. Wozney J.M. Sultzman L.A. Buecker J.L. Pittman D.D. Kaufman R.J. Brown E. Shoemaker C. Orr E.C. Amphlett G.W. Foster W.B. Coe M.L. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Hewick R.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 342-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Within these primer regions, the nucleotide sequences for human and porcine fVIII are identical. Therefore, the same primer pair can be used to amplify from both human and porcine fVIII templates. Reactions were done in 25 μl of total volume containing 1× SYBR Green PCR master mix, 300 μm forward and reverse primers, 6.25 units of Multi-Scribe reverse transcriptase and 5 ng of sample RNA. One-step RT-PCR was performed by incubation at 48 °C for 30 min followed by a single incubation at 95 °C for 10 min and 40 amplification cycles of 95 °C for 15 s then 60 °C for 1 min. Post-reaction dissociation analysis was used to confirm single-product amplification. The calculation of the number of transcripts per cell was derived using a value of 35 μg of total RNA per 106BHK-M cells. For Northern blot analysis, 5 μg of total RNA was separated by 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane as described previously (16Kingston R.E. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 37. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1997: 4.9.1-4.9.16Google Scholar). Rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ cDNAs were labeled using the BrightStar psoralen-biotin nonisotopic labeling kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Biotin-labeled probes were denatured at 95 °C for 10 min and immediately added to ULTRAhyb (Ambion) hybridization buffer. Hybridization was performed overnight at 48 °C, followed by two 5-min washes in 2× SSC at room temperature and two 15-min washes in 0.1× SSC at 48 °C. (1× SSC is 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm Na3 citrate-2H2O, pH 7.0.) Probe detection was performed using the BrightStar BioDetect Nonisotopic Detection Kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cross-hybridization between the human and porcine fVIII sequences was not observed under these conditions. A two-step ion-exchange chromatography procedure was used to isolate rp-fVIII OL from conditioned serum-free medium. Briefly, rp-fVIII OL-containing medium was loaded onto a 5 × 20-cm SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column equilibrated in 0.18 m NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4. Rp-fVIII OL was eluted with a linear 0.18–0.65 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer. Fractions containing fVIII were pooled, diluted to 0.2m NaCl in the same buffer, applied to a Mono Q fast protein liquid chromatography column, and eluted with a linear 0.2–1.0m NaCl gradient. Fractions were analyzed by one-stage coagulation assay at A 280 and SDS-9% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Activated fVIII (fVIIIa) was measured by chromogenic assay using purified human fIXa, human fX, and synthetic phospholipid vesicles as described previously (17Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 nm rp-fVIII OL or rh-fVIII SQ was activated by 30-s incubation with 100 nm human thrombin at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 150 nm desulfatohirudin, and fVIIIa activity was measured at several time points. Expression of rp-fVIII OL was compared with rh-fVIII SQ in the context of the same mammalian expression vector. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with either rh-fVIII SQ or rp-fVIII OL as well as a luciferase control vector and cultured in serum-free medium for 24 h. fVIII activity in the conditioned medium was measured by one-stage coagulation assay and normalized to luciferase activity in the corresponding cell lysate. Media collected from the cells transfected with rp-fVIII OL displayed 9-fold greater fVIII activity than media obtained from cells transfected with rh-fVIII SQ in three independent experiments (data not shown). Stable expression of rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL was generated by transfection of BHK-M cells with the respective expression vectors followed by antibiotic-resistance selection. Between 72 and 84 geneticin-resistant clones were selected and screened for fVIII expression. Because ∼50% of the geneticin-resistant clones from both sets of transfections do not express levels of fVIII above background, only the top 24 fVIII-expressing rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ clones were selected for further analysis. Conditioned serum-free medium from these clones was analyzed for fVIII activity after a 24-h culture period (Fig. 1 A). fVIII activity measured from the rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL populations ranged from 0.25 to 9.2 and 0.05 to 96 units·106cells−1·24 h−1, respectively. The fVIII expression values measured for the two groups are significantly different (p = 0.014, Mann-Whitney U test). The rate of fVIII production from the top three rh-fVIII SQ- and rp-fVIII OL-expressing clones was monitored over a 72-h collection period. The conditioned serum-free medium was collected every 24 h, assayed for fVIII activity, and replaced with an equal volume of fresh serum-free medium. fVIII production from both sets of clones increased with time (data not shown). Rp-fVIII OL expression from the highest expressing clone peaked at 140 units·106cells−1·24 h−1, whereas the maximum rh-fVIII SQ expression observed was 10 units·106cells−1·24 h−1. Addition of purified vWf or co-expression of vWf and fVIII transgenes has been shown to increase fVIII production in heterologous expression systems (8Pittman D.D. Alderman E.M. Tomkinson K.N. Wang J.H. Giles A.R. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1989; 9: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Purified human vWf was added to the culture medium of the highest expressing rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL clones at several concentrations, and fVIII production was measured (Fig. 1 B). At the highest concentration of vWf tested (200 μg/ml), rh-fVIII SQ expression levels reached 15.7 ± 2.8 units·106cells−1·24 h−1 (mean ± S.D.). In contrast, rp-fVIII OL production appeared to peak and level off at 2 μg/ml vWf, with rp-fVIII OL expression levels of 50.7 ± 7.8 units·106 cells−1·24 h−1. High level expression of porcine fVIII could result from disproportionately high steady-state mRNA levels. Real time quantitative fVIII RT-PCR was performed on total RNA from BHK-M cell clones stably expressing rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL (Fig. 2). The numbers of fVIII transcripts/cell were not significantly different between rh-fVIII SQ- and rp-fVIII OL-expressing clones (Mann- WhitneyU test, p = 0.74), despite significant differences in fVIII protein production. Linear regression analysis revealed a statistically significant correlation between fVIII activity and fVIII transcripts for both rh-fVIII SQ and rp-fVIII OL (p < 0.05). Northern blot analysis of total RNA, from the three highest expressing rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ clones, identified a band at nucleotide 6,000 whose relative intensity correlated directly with the number of fVIII transcripts/cell as determined by real time RT-PCR (data not shown). Milligram quantities of rp-fVIII OL were purified 5,300-fold from 10 liters of conditioned medium using a two-step ion-exchange chromatography procedure (Table I). Approximately 54,000 units of purified rp-fVIII OL were obtained at a yield of 94%. The specific activity of rp-fVIII OL was calculated using an estimation of the molar extinction coefficient obtained by absorbance at 280 nm and the known tyrosine, tryptophan, and cysteine content (20Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). The mean (± S.D.) specific activity of the peak fractions obtained from three independent preparations was 2,050 ± 770 units/nmol (12,400 ± 4,640 units/mg). This value is slightly higher, but not significantly different (Student's t test,p = 0.4), than that obtained for rh-fVIII SQ from four separate preparations that were purified using the same method (1,630 ± 530 units/nmol (9,870 ± 3,180 units/mg)).Table IPurification of rp-fVIII OLSampleVolumeA 280TotalA 280ActivityUnitsUnits/A 280AQ1-aActivation quotient (see “Experimental Procedures”).YieldPurificationmlunits/ml-fold increase%-fold increaseMedium10,0002.7027,0005.757,0002.11201001SP-Sepharose pool2350.051116037,4003,460106661,640Mono Q pool4.81.004.811,20053,70011,10070945,2901-a Activation quotient (see “Experimental Procedures”). Open table in a new tab The purity of isolated rp-fVIII OL was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.3). The majority of the purified protein was present in the heterodimeric (heavy chain/light chain) form characteristic of PACE/furin intracellular processing (21Lind P. Larsson K. Spira J. Sydow-Backman M. Almstedt A. Gray E. Sandberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). A small amount of unprocessed, single-chain material also was present. After incubation with thrombin, A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 bands appeared, representative of heterotrimeric thrombin-activated fVIII (fVIIIa) (22Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation of the A2 subunit from the heterotrimeric form of fVIII results in loss of fVIIIa cofactor activity. Following thrombin activation, decay of rp-fVIIIa OL and rh-fVIIIa SQ was monitored over a 30-min time course (Fig. 4). Decay of rp-fVIIIa OL cofactor activity was substantially slower than rh-fVIIIa SQ. Rp-fVIIIa OL and rh-fVIIIa SQ demonstrated half-lives from 7 to 10 and from 2 to 3 min, respectively. The study of fVIII biosynthesis primarily has been limited toin vitro heterologous expression systems because there are no known cell lines that express endogenous fVIII (5Kaufman R.J. Pipe S.W. Tagliavacca L. Swaroop M. Moussalli M. Blood Coagul. Fibrinolysis. 1997; 8 Suppl. 2: S3-S14PubMed Google Scholar). Using heterologous expression, several factors that limit expression have been identified, including low mRNA levels (24Lynch C.M. Israel D.I. Kaufman R.J. Miller A.D. Hum.

Despite these insights into fVIII regulation, expression continues to be significantly lower than other recombinant proteins in the heterologous systems used in commercial manufacturing (5Kaufman R.J.

Gene Ther. 1995; 6: 1363-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that rp-fVIII OL is expressed at levels up to 14-fold greater than rh fVIII SQ. These levels are substantially greater than in previously published reports of fVIII expression (8Pittman D.D. Alderman E.M. Tomkinson K.N. Wang J.H. Giles A.R. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1993; 81: 2925-2935Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,18Kaufman R.J. Wasley L.C. Dorner A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6352-6362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kaufman R.J.

Negrier C. Thromb. Haemost. 2001; 86: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). No specific manipulations were made to either the cDNAs or the expression vector designed to enhance fVIII expression other than the incorporation of a linker sequence between the A2 and A3 domains that includes a PACE/furin recognition sequence. This linker functions to facilitate intracellular processing of the single-chain fVIII protein into the heterodimeric (A1-A2/A3-C1-C2) form (21Lind P. Larsson K. Spira J. Sydow-Backman M. Almstedt A. Gray E. Sandberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Rp-fVIII OL and rh-fVIII SQ expression cassettes do not contain endogenous fVIII 5′-untranslated region sequence, whereas both possess the first 749 nucleotides (of 1805 nucleotides) of the human fVIII 3′-untranslated region (33Gitschier J. Wood W.I. Goralka T.M. Wion K.L. Chen E.Y. Eaton D.H. Vehar G.A. Capon D.J. Lawn R.M. Nature. 1984; 312: 326-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the increased production of rp-fVIII OL does not equate with higher steady-state levels of fVIII mRNA (Fig. 2). This finding precludes increased transcription rates, enhanced nuclear export, or greater mRNA stability as possible mechanisms for the high level expression of rp-fVIII. There is likely an increased translational and/or post-translational efficiency of rp-fVIII OL expression. Further studies are warranted to identify differences in the kinetics of expression between human and porcine fVIII. The expression of rp-fVIII OL from BHK-M cells in serum-free medium is sufficiently high that a two-step procedure using only ion-exchange chromatography is adequate to remove contaminant proteins (Fig. 3). In contrast, commercial manufacture of existing recombinant fVIII products involves the use of immunoaffinity chromatography, which complicates the developmental validation process. This potential simplification may lead to more economical commercial production of fVIII. Previously, we compared the specific activity of purified plasma-derived porcine fVIII to plasma-derived human fVIII (17Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of porcine fVIII increased as a function of concentration and exceeded the specific activity of human fVIII. In the present study, the concentration of rp-fVIII OL was maintained within the limits of the clotting times obtained for the pooled human plasma standard curve. Under these conditions, the specific activities were not significantly different. In contrast, the decay of thrombin-activated rh-fVIII SQ activity was significantly faster than that of rp-fVIII OL (Fig. 4) and was similar to a previous comparison of plasma-derived human and porcine fVIII (17Lollar P. Parker E.T. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23652-23657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneous loss of activity of thrombin-activated fVIII is caused by dissociation of the A2 subunit (23Lollar P. Parker C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates that A2-subunit dissociation does not contribute to fVIII activity under the normal conditions of the one-stage fVIII coagulation assay. In a two-stage assay, fVIII is activated with thrombin in the first stage. Evidence that A2-subunit dissociation does contribute to the two-stage assay comes from the identification of patients with mild hemophilia A who have low two-stage activity relative to one-stage activity (35Pipe S.W. Eickhorst A.N. McKinley S.H. Saenko E.L. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 1999; 93: 176-183Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pipe S.W. Saenko E.L. Eickhorst A.N. Kemball-Cook G. Kaufman R.J. Blood. 2001; 97: 685-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These patients have abnormally fast A2 dissociation rates due to mutations in the A1 and/or A2 domains. It should be possible to identify porcine fVIII cDNA sequence(s) that confer(s) high level expression and to generate a recombinant hybrid human/porcine fVIII that incorporates only the porcine sequences that are necessary and/or sufficient for high level expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that functional fVIII protein can be produced from hybrid human/porcine molecules (10Barrow R.T. Healey J.F. Jacquemin M.G. Saint-Remy J.M. Lollar P. Blood. 2001; 97: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,37Barrow R.T. Healey J.F. Gailani D. Scandella D. Lollar P. Blood. 2000; 95: 564-568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Healey J.F.

Scandella D. Runge M.S. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8639-8641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This type of analysis could enable the identification of a novel type of genetic or biochemical regulation for fVIII that may or may not be shared by other proteins. A “high-expression” fVIII construct could be extremely valuable for increasing the production capability of commercial recombinant fVIII therapeutics, which remain costly and in limited supply. Additionally, because the high expression phenotype of hybrid porcine/human fVIII is casued by differences at the translational or post-translational level, it should also be expressed at high levels from viral vector systems, thereby functioning to increase the effectiveness of gene-therapy approaches for hemophilia A."

To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the DHA-induced PLD activation, we first characterized the PLD expression pattern of PBMC. We show that these cells express PLD1 and PLD2 at the protein and mRNA level and are devoid of oleate-dependent PLD activity. DHA enrichment of PBMC increased the DHA content of cell phospholipids, which was directly correlated with the extent of PLD activation. The DHA-induced PLD activation was independent of conventional protein kinase C but inhibited by brefeldin A, which suggests ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, DHA enrichment dose-dependently stimulated ARF translocation to cell membranes. Whereas 50% of the guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate plus ARF-dependent PLD activity and a substantial part of PLD1 protein were located to the detergent-insoluble membranes, so-called rafts, of non-enriched PBMC, DHA treatment strongly displaced them toward detergent-soluble membranes where ARF is present. Collectively, these results suggest that the exclusion of PLD1 from lipid rafts, due to their partial disorganization by DHA, and its relocalization in the vicinity of ARF, is responsible for its activation. This PLD activation might be responsible for the immunosuppressive effect of DHA because it is known to transmit antiproliferative signals in lymphoid cells.

Fatty Acids. 1999; 60: 371-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Accordingly, dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids decreases the production of T cell-derived cytokines and lymphoproliferation (3Endres S. Meydani S.N. Ghorbani R. Schindler R. Dinarello C.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1993; 54: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 4Calder P.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 301-309Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Although fish oil-derived fatty acids have found clinical applications for the treatment of various inflammatory diseases (5Belluzzi A. Brignola C. Campieri M. Pera A. Boschi S. Miglioli M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 334: 1557-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar) and as adjuvant immunosuppressive agents (6Van der Heide J.J. Bilo H.J. Donker J.M. Wilmink J.M. Tegzess A.M. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 329: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of PUFA-induced T cell inhibition have not yet been elucidated in detail. We have reported previously (7Bechoua S. Dubois M. Némoz G. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the mitogenic lectin concanavalin A was able to stimulate phospholipase D (PLD) activity, whereas no stimulation was observed in control cells. PLD acts on phosphatidylcholine (PC) to release phosphatidic acid, a bioactive molecule that has been implicated in the regulation of numerous cellular functions including cell proliferation and apoptosis (8Nakashima S. Nozawa Y. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1999; 98: 153-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Two mammalian PLD have been cloned from various human and murine sources. PLD1 has a low basal activity and is activated by ADP-ribosylation factors (ARF), Rho family GTP-binding proteins, and protein kinase C (PKC) in the presence of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2). PLD2 has a high basal activity in the presence of PIP2 but is unresponsive to small G proteins and PKC (9Frohman M.A. Sung T.-C. Morris A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 175-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 10Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Another PLD form that is dependent on unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate for its activation has also been described, but it has not been cloned yet (10Liscovitch M. Czarny M. Fiucci G. Tang X. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 401-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this oleate-activated PLD seems to be the major form detected in lysates of Jurkat T cells where it could be implicated in the apoptotic process (11Kasai T.K. Ohguchi K. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Naganawa T. Kondo N. Nozawa Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 6469-6474PubMed Google Scholar). In addition Jurkat T cells also express GTP-dependent PLD activity (12Bacon K.B. Schall T.J. Dairaghi D.J. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1894-1900PubMed Google Scholar). PLD protein and mRNA expression has been well demonstrated in several established lymphocytic cell lines (13Meier K.E. Gibbs T.C. Knoepp S.M. Ella K.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), but only few reports have addressed the PLD of human PBMC. A PLD activity, detected by means of the transphosphatidylation reaction, has been described in these cells (7Bechoua S. Dubois M. Némoz G. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reid P.A. Gardner S.D. Williams D.M. Harnett M.M. Immunology. 1997; 90: 250-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, the identity of the PLD isoforms in presence is not precisely known. In the past few years, several groups have reported the presence of PLD enzymes in caveolae, which are specialized domains of the plasma membrane related to sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich microdomains or rafts. Both PLD1 and PLD2 have been found in caveolar membranes depending on the type of cell considered. Thus, PLD1 has been detected in the caveolin-rich membrane fractions of 3Y1 rat fibroblasts (15Kim J.H. Han J.M. Lee S. Kim Y. Lee T.G. Park J.B. Lee S.D. Suh P.-G. Ryu S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3763-3769Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and C2C12 mouse skeletal myotubes (16Meacci E. Donati C. Cencetti F. Romiti E. Farnararo M. Bruni P. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In human keratinocytes, PLD2 was located in the caveolin-rich low density fractions, whereas PLD1 was clearly excluded from the caveolar fractions (17Czarny M. Fiucci G. Lavie Y. Banno Y. Nozawa Y. Liscovitch M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 467: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In contrast, both PLD1 and PLD2 were found in caveolae of NIH 3T3 cells transfected by activated oncogenic forms of src, ras, andraf(18Xu L. Shen Y. Joseph T. Bryant A. Luo J.-Q. Frankel P. Rotunda T. Foster D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 273: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although lymphocytes are devoid of caveolae and caveolin expression (19Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30745-30748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), their plasma membrane contains typical sphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich microdomains, which have a key role in immune cell signaling (20Janes P.W. Ley S.C. Magee A.I. Kabouridis P.S. Semin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 23-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 21Langlet C. Bernard A.-M. Drevot P. He H.-T. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 250-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). It has been shown that upon cross-linking, the T cell antigen receptor associates with lipid rafts and promotes the recruitment and aggregation of raft-associated proteins such as Src family kinases while excluding others such as tyrosine phosphatase, which initiates phosphorylation signaling cascades. Interestingly, in PUFA-enriched T cells the Src kinases Lck and Fyn appeared to be excluded from rafts suggesting that PUFA had partially disrupted these structures (22Stulnig T.M. Berger M. Sigmund T. Raederstorff D. Stockinger H. Waldhäusl W. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), which might explain their immunosuppressive effect. The goal of the present study was to characterize further the PLD activity of human PBMC to investigate the possible association of PLD enzymes with lipid rafts and to determine the mechanisms involved in the increase of PLD activity induced by DHA in mitogen-stimulated cells. In particular, we considered the possibility that the location of PLD isoforms inside or outside lipid rafts might be altered under the influence of DHA with, as a consequence, changes in the impact of T cell stimulation on PLD activity. Peripheral blood was obtained from healthy subjects who had not taken any medication for 2 weeks prior to blood donation (Etablissement Français du Sang, Lyon, France). Venous blood was drawn into citrate-phosphate-dextran anticoagulant. PBMC were separated by dextran sedimentation and density gradient centrifugation through Histopaque 1077 (Sigma) and then washed three times with RPMI 1640 by low speed centrifugation in order to more thoroughly eliminate the contaminating platelets. PBMC were then adjusted to a concentration of 2 × 107 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (with Hepes and bicarbonate) medium. All steps were carried out at room temperature. Under such conditions, cell viability established by the trypan blue exclusion test was always greater than 95%. Flow cytometry analyses of cell preparations after staining with specific monoclonal antibodies showed that about 65–70% of the isolated cells were CD3+ T cells (T3 Coulter clone), 4–6% were CD19+ B cells (B4 Coulter clone), 16–24% were CD11b+ monocytes (MO1 Coulter clone), and 4–6% were CD41a+ platelets (GP IIb IIIa, Immunotech, Marseille, France). For the preparation of fatty acid-albumin complexes, docosahexaenoic acid (Sigma) was stored at −20 °C in ethanol solution under nitrogen. Different amounts of the ethanolic solution were evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. 5 μm human delipidated serum albumin (HSA) in RPMI 1640 medium was added to give final fatty acid concentrations ranging from 5 to 15 μm and an albumin to fatty acid ratio varying from 1 to 3. The mixtures were incubated under nitrogen for 4 h at 37 °C. DHA enrichment of PBMC was achieved by incubating the cells (2 × 107cells/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 medium containing increasing concentrations of DHA bound to 5 μm delipidated HSA. The fatty acid composition of cell phospholipids was analyzed by gas chromatography. Cell lipid extracts or lipids extracted from the gradient fractions were separated on Silica Gel G60 plates (Merck) with the solvent system hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (60:40:1, by volume). The silica gel areas corresponding to phospholipids were scraped off and transmethylated. Briefly, 1 volume of 5% H2SO4 in methanol was added to the scraped silica gel, and transmethylation was carried out at 100 °C for 90 min in screw-capped tubes. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1.5 volume of ice-cold 5% (w/v) K2CO3, and the fatty acid methyl esters were extracted with isooctane and analyzed using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences chromatograph model 5830, equipped with a capillary column (30 m × 0.32 mm, Supelco) and a flame ionization detection. The column was two-step programmed from 135 to 160 °C at 2 °C/min and from 160 to 205 °C at 1.5 °C/min; the detection temperature was maintained at 250 °C. The vector gas was helium at a pressure of 0.8 pounds/square inch (5520 pascals). Peaks were identified using standard fatty acid methyl esters. PLD was determined on the basis of its transphosphatidylation activity. Freshly isolated cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in the presence of [3H]arachidonic acid (37 kBq/ml, specific activity 7400 GBq/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) in 0.1% ethanol and then washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium. Labeled cells were further enriched with DHA as described above. Control cells were incubated without fatty acid in the presence of 5 μm HSA alone. DHA-treated and control cells were then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 1% butanol or 1% ethanol, and in the absence (unstimulated) or presence of 5 μg/106 cells concanavalin A (+ConA), a specific activator of T cells. In some experiments, control and DHA-enriched cells were stimulated with 0.1 μg/ml OKT3 (Cilag Laboratories, Levallois Perret, France) for 30 min in the presence of 1% butanol. In experiments designed to investigate the influence of inhibitors, the following conditions were used: bisindolylmaleimide (BIM, 1 μm) and calphostin C (126 nm) were added 30 min before ConA activation, and brefeldin A (BFA, 1–25 μg/ml) was added 10 min before ConA activation. Incubations were terminated by addition of ethanol and acidification of the medium to pH 3–4 with 2n HCl. Lipids were extracted with chloroform/ethanol (6:3, by volume) according to Boukhchache and Lagarde (23Boukhchache D. Lagarde M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 713: 386-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) in the presence of 50 μm butylhydroxylated toluene. Phosphatidylalcohols were separated on bidimensional TLC (Silica Gel G60 plates, Merck) using chloroform, methanol, 28% ammonia (65:35:5.5, by volume) for the first migration, and ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid (9:5:2, by volume) for migration in the second dimension. Spots stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R were scraped off and mixed with Picofluor (Packard Instrument Co.), and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactivity associated with phosphatidylalcohols was expressed as percentage of the radioactivity incorporated in total phospholipids. Oleate-dependent PLD activity was measured as described by Chalifa et al. (24Chalifa V. Möhn H. Liscovitch M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17512-17519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (120 μl) contained 50 mm Na-Hepes buffer, pH 7.2, 2.7 mm(107 cpm/assay) [3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine ([3H]DPPC, specific activity 3700 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), 4 mm sodium oleate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2% ethanol, and 60–100 μg of proteins from total cell lysates. After 30 min of incubation the reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 ml of ice-cold chloroform/methanol/HCl (1:1:0.002) and mixing. Phase separation was achieved by further addition of 0.1 n HCl, 1 mmEGTA, mixing, and centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 10 min). The organic phase was collected, dried under nitrogen, and redissolved in chloroform/methanol containing standard phosphatidylethanol as a carrier. Phosphatidylethanol was separated on TLC using ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid (9:5:2). Plates were stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R, and spots corresponding to phosphatidylethanol were scraped off and mixed with Picofluor, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The radioactivity associated with phosphatidylalcohols was expressed as percentage of the radioactivity of the substrate [3H]DPPC. PIP2-dependent PLD activity was determined according to Brown et al. (25Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C. Cell. 1993; 75: 1137-1144Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of mixed lipid vesicles (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate/phosphatidylcholine, molar ratio 16:1.5:1) with [choline-methyl-3H]dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (specific activity 2200 GBq/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) to give 106 cpm per assay was added to 40 μl of cell lysate in a total of 100 μl containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol. Assays were done with or without 50 μm GTPγS and 1 μm rARF. The final PC concentration was 8 μm. Assays were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and stopped as described above. After centrifugation, the radioactivity of an aliquot of the aqueous phase was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Recombinant ARF was kindly provided by Dr. Blandine Geny, INSERM U332, Paris, France. Total RNA was isolated from human PBMC using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase (Promega, Lyon, France) using random hexamer mixed oligonucleotides. Specific primers for the amplification of PLD1 transcripts were designed on the basis of published human sequences (26Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K., Gu, Q.-M. Cook S. Nozawa Y.

The sense and antisense primers were 5′-GGGATCCGTGTGAAGCGGGTCACTTCAGGACCG-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCTCTGGTTTCCCCATGCAGCTCTCCCAC-3′, respectively. Primers to specifically amplify PLD2 transcripts were designed on the basis of published human sequences (27Steed P.M. Clark K.L. Boyar W.C. Lasala D.J. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and chosen in a domain corresponding to the N-terminal part of the protein. The sense and antisense primers were 5′-GGGAATTCGACGGCGACCCCTGAGAGCCTCTTC-3′ and 5′-GGGAATTCACGGTATTTCTTCTTGGTTGTCCAGG-3′, respectively. Amplification conditions for PLD1 were 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, for 35 cycles. Amplification conditions for PLD2 were 94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, for 35 cycles. PCDNA3 plasmids carrying the hPLD1b and hPLD2 cDNAs originating from Dr. M. Frohman's laboratory and kindly provided to us by Dr. Michel Record (Toulouse, France) were used for positive controls. Pelleted cells were washed three times with Phillips' buffer and disrupted by glycerol lysis according to Caldwell et al. (28Caldwell K.K. Newell M.K. Cambier J.C. Prasad K.N. Masserano J.M. Schlegel W. Cooper D.M.F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 177-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) as described previously (29Zakaroff-Girard A., El Bawab S. Némoz G. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 65: 381-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). After glycerol treatment, the cells were pelleted at 900 × gfor 10 min, resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, 25 mm sucrose, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.05 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 units/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4), and stored frozen at −80 °C. After thawing, the cells were homogenized in a glass/Teflon homogenizer (40 strokes at maximal speed), and homogenates were centrifuged at 42,000 ×g for 20 min. Particulate and cytosolic fractions (3 volumes) were mixed with 4× concentrated Laemmli buffer (1 volume), and proteins were determined by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (30Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1953) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Proteins were separated on a 10 (PKCα) or 15% (ARF) acrylamide gel and electrotransfered onto an Immobilon P membrane (Millipore, St. Quentin Yvelines, France). For PLD Western blot analyses, proteins were denatured by 4 m urea in Laemmli buffer and separated on 8% acrylamide gel in 4 m urea. Aspecific antibody-binding sites were saturated by incubating membranes in TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% bovine serum albumin, overnight at 4 °C. All following steps were performed in TBS-T at room temperature. After washing, the blots were incubated for 90 min either with an anti-PKCα monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:2000) or with an anti-ARF 1:3 polyclonal antibody (sheep IgG, Upstate Biotechnology Inc., diluted 1:1000). The PLD isoforms were detected with PLD1 and PLD2 antisera (dilution 1:2000) prepared by Dr. S. Bourgoin (Laval University, Canada). PLD1 antiserum was raised against the following short human PLD1 peptides: residues 1–16, 144–162, 967–981, and 1027–1040. PLD2 antiserum was raised against the N-terminal sequence of human PLD2 (residues 13–33). After washing, membranes were incubated for 1 h either with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:15,000) or a donkey anti-sheep antibody (Sigma, 1:10,000) or a goat anti-rabbit antibody (Bio-Rad, 1:20,000). Immunoreactive proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) and x-ray film autoradiography. Bands were then quantified with a videodensitometric analyzer (Bioprofil, Vilbert-Lourmat, Germany). Lipid rafts were isolated according to the procedure of Montixi et al. (31Montixi C. Langlet C. Bernard A.-M. Thimonier J. Dubois C. Wurbel M.-A. Chauvin J.-P. Pierres M. He H.-T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar) based on the insolubility of these structures in cold non-ionic detergent, with slight modifications. Briefly, control or DHA-enriched PBMC, either stimulated or not (5 × 108 cells), were homogenized in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA) supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor mixture Sigma) and 1 mm orthovanadate. After centrifugation at 800 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the post-nuclear supernatant was incubated with Triton X-100 at a final concentration of 1% for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was then adjusted to 1.3 m sucrose by the addition of an equal volume of 2.6 m sucrose and placed at the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube, and a step sucrose gradient (0.2–0.9m with 0.1 m steps, 1 ml each) was placed on top. It was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 16 h in an SW41 rotor (Kontron) at 4 °C. One-ml fractions were recovered from the bottom to the top of the gradient. The sucrose concentration of each fraction was determined with a Brix refractometer (Merck). Aliquots were immediately used for PLD and 5′-nucleotidase assays, and the remaining was stored at −80 °C until lipid analyses. 5′-Nucleotidase activity of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CD73, used as a marker of lipid rafts, was assayed as described by Gentry and Olsson (32Gentry M.K. Olsson R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Aliquots of the gradient fractions were incubated with 1 μm[3H]5′AMP (specific activity 722 GBq/mmol, AmershamBiosciences) in 1 ml of reaction mixture containing 60 mmTris, pH 7.4, 1 μm erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine to inhibit endogenous adenosine deaminase, 20,000 cpm [14C]adenosine as an internal standard, with or without 25 μm adenosine 5′-(α,β-methylene)diphosphate (AMPCP) to inhibit 5′-nucleotidase activity, for 30 min at 37 °C. The incubation was terminated by addition of 200 μl of 5% ZnSO4 and 200 μl of 0.3 mBa(OH)2. After centrifugation, the radioactivity of supernatant containing [3H]adenosine was measured by liquid scintillation counting. 5′-Nucleotidase activity obtained by difference between values with and without AMPCP was expressed as nmol of 5′-AMP hydrolyzed per min per mg of proteins. GM1 was quantitated on dot blots according to Ilangumaran et al. (33Ilangumaran S. Arni S. Van Echten-Deckert G. Borisch B. Hoessli D.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 891-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of each gradient fraction were dotted onto Immobilon using a Hybri-Dot Manifold apparatus (Bethesda). Membranes were rinsed with distilled water and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T for 1 h. After three 10-min washes with TBS-T, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated cholera toxin in TBS-T containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 90 min and then rinsed 7 times with TBS-T and developed with the ECL reagent. The luminograms were quantitated using cooled digital CCD camera system (ImageMaster VDS-CL, Amersham Biosciences) and ImageQuant software. PIP2 was quantitated on dot blots performed as described above using a mouse PIP2 antiserum (Assay Designs, Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France, dilution 1:500) for immunodetection and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody diluted 1:10,000 as the secondary antibody. Total phospholipids were assayed with the ammonium ferrothiocyanate method according to Stewart (34Stewart J.C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar). Cholesterol was determined enzymatically using a commercial assay kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PLD activities were determined on 40-μl aliquots of each gradient fraction as described above. For PLD1 Western blotting, proteins from 400 μl of each fraction were precipitated with ice-cold acetone, and pellets were dissolved in 40 μl of Laemmli buffer containing 4 m urea. PLD2 proteins were immunoprecipitated from 400 μl of gradient fractions using the PLD2 antiserum described above according to Marcilet al. (35Marcil J. Harbour D. Naccache P.H. Bourgoin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20660-20664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To define more precisely the PLD-stimulating effect of DHA that we have observed previously (7Bechoua S. Dubois M. Némoz G. Lagarde M. Prigent A.F. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in human PBMC, cells were preincubated for 2 h with increasing concentrations of DHA complexed to human delipidated albumin (DHA to albumin ratio from 0 to 3) before T cell stimulation with ConA in the presence of 1% butanol. A marked and dose-dependent increase of PLD activity was observed in DHA-treated cells compared with control cells incubated in the presence of delipidated albumin (Fig.1 A). Gas chromatography analysis of the fatty acid composition of cell phospholipids showed that the relative amount of esterified DHA was concomitantly increased (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, PLD activity was significantly correlated to the percentage of DHA present in cell phospholipids (Fig.1 C, r = 0.68, p = 0.015,n = 12). These results suggest that the extent of PLD activation was directly related to DHA enrichment of membrane phospholipids. A PLD-stimulating effect of DHA was also observed when PBMC were stimulated with the anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody OKT3, although the extent of PLD activation was lower than that induced by ConA (Fig. 1 D). To investigate the PLD isoform expression pattern of human PBMC, we performed RT-PCR using primers for PLD1, allowing us to discriminate between the two splice variants PLD1a and PLD1b, and primers specific for PLD2. As shown in Fig. 2 A, human PBMC clearly express the three PLD transcripts. It is noteworthy that the intensity of the PLD1a band appeared to be roughly 2-fold higher than that of PLD1b, suggesting that human PBMC preferentially express the former variant. Western blot analyses of total cell lysates showed that both PLD1 and PLD2 are also expressed at the protein level (Fig.2 B). To characterize further the PLD present in human PBMC, we then measured the enzyme activity of cell lysates using specific assay conditions. Although the above results clearly denote the presence of PLD1 and PLD2 in human PBMC, they do not rule out the possible presence of an oleate-dependent enzyme, which has not yet been characterized at the molecular level. Because the PLD activity of human PBMC was up-regulated by DHA enrichment prior to mitogenic activation, it was important to look for an oleate-dependent activity in PBMC lysates. As shown in Fig.2 C, PBMC lysates did not show any oleate-stimulated PLD activity. In contrast, a marked synthesis of phosphatidylethanol was observed when PIP2 was included in the substrate phospholipid vesicles confirming the presence of a PIP2-dependent PLD activity in these cells.

All proteins of this family have Cdk-binding and anion-binding sites, but only mammalian Cks1 binds to Skp2 and promotes the association of Skp2 with p27 phosphorylated on Thr-187. The molecular mechanisms by which Cks1 promotes the interaction of the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase subunit to p27 remained obscure. Here we show that the Skp2-binding site of Cks1 is located on a region including the α2- and α1-helices and their immediate vicinity, well separated from the other two binding sites. All three binding sites of Cks1 are required for p27-ubiquitin ligation and for the association of Skp2 with Cdk-bound, Thr-187-phosphorylated p27. Cks1 and Skp2 mutually promote the binding of each other to a peptide similar to the 19 C-terminal amino acids of p27 containing phosphorylated Thr-187. This latter process requires the Skp2- and anion-binding sites of Cks1, but not its Cdk-binding site. It is proposed that the Skp2-Cks1 complex binds initially to the C-terminal region of phosphorylated p27 in a process promoted by the anion-binding site of Cks1. The interaction of Skp2 with the substrate is further strengthened by the association of the Cdk-binding site of Cks1 with Cdk2/cyclin E, to which phosphorylated p27 is bound.

The levels of p27 are high in quiescent cells. Following stimulation by mitogenic agents, p27 is rapidly degraded, allowing Cdk2 action to drive cells into the S-phase (1Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5145) Google Scholar). p27 is destabilized in human cancers (2Slingerland J. Pagano M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 10-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Thus, the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of p27 degradation is of considerable interest. Previous work has shown that p27 is degraded by the ubiquitin pathway (3Pagano M. Tam S.W. Theodoras A.M. Beer-Romero P. Del Sal G. Chau V. Yew P.R. Draetta G.F. Rolfe M. Science. 1995; 269: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1735) Google Scholar). The ubiquitylation and degradation of p27 require its phosphorylation on Thr-187 (4Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1190-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated p27 is recognized by an SCF (Skp1-Cullin 1-F box protein) ubiquitin ligase complex, which contains Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated protein2) as the specific substrate-binding F box protein (6Carrano A.C.

SCF complexes are a large family of ubiquitin-protein ligases, whose variable F box protein subunits recognize a variety of phosphorylated substrates (9Deshaies R.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 435-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). Skp2 is unique among known mammalian F box proteins in that its levels fluctuate in the cell cycle, being very low in G0/G1 and increasing in entry of cells into the S-phase (10Zhang H. Kobayashi R.

An interesting feature of the SCFSkp2 ubiquitylating machinery is that it requires an accessory protein, Cks1 (Cdc kinase subunit 1) (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M.

Cks1 belongs to the Cks/Suc1 (suppressor ofcdc2) family of small (9–18 kDa) proteins, conserved in eukaryotic evolution. They were originally discovered in fission (20Hayles J. Beach D. Durkacz B.

Holmes W. Rocque W. Reed S.I. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1996; 84: 863-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In addition, they all have an anion-binding site, which can bind phosphate, sulfate, or acidic residues in proteins (22Pines J. Curr.

Indeed, Cks-assisted multiphosphorylation of some cell cycle regulatory proteins by Cdks has been observed (28Patra D. Dunphy W.G.

The requirement for Cks1 appears to be specific for the SCFSkp2 complex, as no such requirement has been found with some other SCF ubiquitin ligases (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). On the other hand, it is not specific for p27, because the ubiquitylation of cyclin E by SCFSkp2 also requires Cks1. 2E. Eytan and A. Hershko, unpublished results. Interestingly, levels of Cks1 mRNA (21Hadwiger J.A. Wittenberg C. Mendenhall M.D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) and protein 3T. Bashir and M. Pagano, unpublished data. also fluctuate in the cell cycle in parallel with levels of Skp2. This may provide an additional control mechanism for the timely degradation of substrates of the SCFSkp2 complex in the cell cycle. It was surprising to find that Cks1 cannot be replaced for p27-ubiquitin ligation by the closely related human orthologue Cks2 (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M.

Mendenhall M.D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). This was explained by the observation that Cks1, but not Cks2, binds to Skp2 (18Ganoth D.

Furthermore it was found that Cks1 promoted the binding of Skp2 to Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which Cks1 facilitates the interaction of the Skp2 ubiquitin ligase subunit to its substrate remained obscure. Although it was known that Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 has to be presented to the ubiquitin ligase in trimeric complex with Cdk2-cyclin A/E (4Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), it was proposed that the action of Cks1 is independent of its binding to Cdk (19Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, we have used site-directed mutagenesis to identify the Skp2-binding site of Cks1 and to show that all three sites of Cks1 are required for its action to promote Skp2-p27 binding. By the use of a phosphorylated C-terminal peptide of p27 as a model substrate, we could distinguish between different steps in which each binding site of Cks1 contributes to the high affinity binding of this ubiquitin ligase subunit to its substrate protein. His6-Skp1/Skp2, his6-Cul1/Roc1, and his6-cyclin E/Cdk2 were produced by co-infection of 5B insect cells with baculoviruses encoding the corresponding proteins and were purified by nickel-agarose chromatography, as described previously (4Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 6Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). The approximate concentrations of these preparations are as follows (in μm): Cul1/Roc1, 1; Skp1, 7; Skp2, 0.4; cyclin E/Cdk2, 0.5. Site-directed mutagenesis of Cks1 was carried out by the Quickchange kit (Stratagene). Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing in all cases. All mutants to be expressed in bacteria were constructed as his6-Cks1 fusions, and all mutants to be expressed byin vitro transcription-translation or by transient transfection of cells were constructed as Cks1-FLAG fusions in pcDNA3. Control experiments showed that the C-terminal FLAG extension did not impair the activity of wild-type Cks1 in p27-ubiquitin ligation. Cks1 proteins were expressed inEscherichia coli BL21 DE3 strain and were purified by nickel affinity chromatography, removal of the His6 tag by thrombin cleavage and size exclusion chromatography, as described (31Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Because of the construction and thrombin cleavage procedure, all bacterially expressed Cks1 proteins had two extra amino acid residues (GS) at the N terminus. Control experiments showed that the activity of wild-type Cks1 in p27 ubiquitylation was not affected by the GS N-terminal extension. All bacterially expressed proteins were >95% homogeneous, as judged by SDS-PAGE/Coomassie staining and mass spectrometry. The thermodynamic stability of all bacterially expressed Cks1 proteins used in this study was essentially similar to that of wild-type Cks1, as estimated by equilibrium unfolding (31Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled Cks1-FLAG proteins, p27, Skp2, and Cdk2 were produced by in vitro transcription-translation, using the TnT Quick kit (Promega) and [35S]methionine (AmershamBiosciences). The following proteins were prepared as described previously: ubiquitin-activating enzyme (32Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2206-2214Google Scholar), his6-Cdc34 (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), methylated ubiquitin (33Hershko A. Heller H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 1079-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), and ubiquitin aldehyde (34Mayer A.N. Wilkinson K.D. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 166-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained the following in a volume of 10 μl: 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm phosphocreatine, 100 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.5 mm ATP, 1 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 1 mg/ml methylated ubiquitin, 1 pmol of ubiquitin-activating enzyme, 50 pmol of Cdc34, 0.15 μm Skp2/Skp1, 0.2 μmCul1/ROC1, 0.05 μm Cdk2/cyclin E, 0.3 μl of35S-p27, and Cks1 protein as specified. Methylated ubiquitin was used in this assay because its conjugates with p27 are more resistant to degradation by the 26 S proteasome than those of native ubiquitin (4Montagnoli A. Fiore F. Eytan E. Carrano A.C. Draetta G.F. Hershko A. Pagano M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1181-1189Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 6Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). Following incubation at 30 °C for 60 min, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE. Results were quantified by PhosphorImager analysis. A small amount of p27-ubiquitin conjugates formed without added Cks1 was subtracted, and the results were expressed as the percentage of 35S-p27 converted to ubiquitin conjugates. Assays were carried out in the range linear with Cks1 concentrations, which were up to ∼40% of p27 ligated to ubiquitin. To determine the binding of Cks1 to Skp2,35S-labeled Cks1 (1 μl) was incubated with Skp2/Skp1 (1 μl) in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 40 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mmMgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. When the binding to Skp2 of different 35S-labeled Cks1 proteins was compared, the assay was normalized by adding mutant proteins at amounts containing radioactivity similar to that of 1 μl of wild-type35S-Cks1. Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 6 μl of Affi-prep protein A beads linked to rabbit polyclonal anti-Skp2 antibodies (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) were added with 30 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. The samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, and then the beads were washed 4 times with 1-ml portions of RIPA buffer (35Harlow E. Lane D. Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Following elution with SDS electrophoresis sample buffer, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and PhosphorImager analysis. Results were expressed as the percentage of labeled protein bound to beads. The binding of35S-p27 to Skp2 was determined in a similar assay, except that the reaction mixture contained 35S-p27 (1 μl), Cdk2/cyclin E (1 μl), Skp2/Skp1 (1 μl), and ATP, phosphocreatine, and creatine phosphokinase at concentrations similar to those described for the p27-ubiquitin ligation assay. Where indicated, 10 nm of wild-type or mutant bacterially expressed Cks1 proteins were supplemented. Subsequent immunoprecipitation with anti-Skp2 antibodies was as described for the former assay. To determine the binding of 35S-Cdk2 to Cks1 proteins, bacterially expressed wild-type or mutant Cks1 proteins were covalently linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B (Sigma) at ∼1.5 mg/ml beads. Samples of 10 μl of Cks1 beads were mixed with 20 μl of a reaction mixture similar to that described for the binding of35S-Cks1 to Skp2/Skp1 but with 35S-Cdk2 instead of the latter two components. Following rotation at room temperature for 60 min, beads were washed 4 times with RIPA buffer as above. To determine the binding of 35S-Skp2 or35S-Cks1 to C-terminal peptides of p27, we have used two synthetic peptides (Sigma) of sequence similar to that of the 19 C-terminal amino acid residues of human p27. These were NAGSVEQTPKKPGLRRRQT for the unphosphorylated peptide, and a similar sequence with phosphorylated Thr at position 8 (corresponding to Thr-187 in full-length p27) for the phosphopeptide. The peptides were covalently linked to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B at a concentration of 7 mg/ml beads. To determine the binding of Skp2 to p27 peptide beads, 35S-Skp2 (3 μl) was first incubated in the presence or absence of bacterially expressed Cks1 proteins (at concentrations indicated in the figures), in a 10-μl reaction mixture containing 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 1 μm okadaic acid. Okadaic acid was added to minimize dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated peptide by phosphatases present in reticulocyte lysates. Following incubation at 30 °C for 15 min, 10 μl of p27 peptide or p27 phosphopeptide beads were added. Samples were rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, washed 4 times in RIPA buffer, and processed as described above for the other binding assays. The binding of 35S-Cks1 to p27 peptide or phosphopeptide beads was determined by a similar procedure, except that35S-labeled Cks1 proteins (normalized to contain radioactivity similar to that of 1 μl of wild-type35S-Cks1) were incubated with or without unlabeled Sk2/Skp1 (1 μl). All results were quantified and expressed as the percentage of 35S-labeled protein bound to beads. It was shown previously (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 19Spruck C. Strohmaier H. Watson M. Smith A.P. Ryan A. Krek T.W. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 639-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) that human Cks1 is required for p27-ubiquitin ligation by the SCFSkp2 complex, binds to Skp2, and promotes the binding of Thr-187-phosphorylated p27 to Skp2. A closely related human homologue, Cks2, which is 81% identical and 85% similar to Cks1, has none of these activities. We have therefore set out to identify the Skp2-binding site of Cks1 by mutagenesis of specific amino acid residues in which non-conservative substitutions between Cks1 and Cks2 occur. As shown in Fig.1 A (red letters), there are 12 such amino acid residues in the 79-amino acid human Cks1 proteins. We have mutated most of these amino acid residues in Cks1 to those present in Cks2; the resulting derivatives were designated “Cks1 → Cks2 mutants.” Because the crystal structures of human Cks1 (25Arvai A.S.

Science. 1993; 262: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) are very similar, it seemed reasonable to expect that these mutations would nor impair much protein structure and stability. Indeed, the thermodynamic stability of all Cks1 → Cks2 mutants, estimated by urea-induced equilibrium denaturation (31Seeliger M.A. Schymkowitz J.W.H. Rousseau F. Wilkinson H.R. Itzhaki L.S. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1202-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), was not significantly decreased as compared with that of wild-type Cks1 (data not shown). Most mutants were expressed by the following two methods: (a) bacterial expression, followed by purification to >95% homogeneity; (b) in vitro transcription and translation (IVTT) of35S-labeled Cks1 derivatives in reticulocyte lysates. The second method was required to produce radiolabeled Cks1 mutants, required for some of the assays, and to confirm the results obtained with bacterially expressed Cks1 proteins. We have first examined the influence of different Cks1 → Cks2 mutants on p27-ubiquitin ligation in the presence of purified components of the SCFSkp2 complex. A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 1 B. It may be seen that ubiquitylation of35S-labeled p27, assayed by its conversion to higher molecular weight derivatives, was strongly stimulated by wild-type Cks1 but to a much lesser extent by certain Cks1 → Cks2 mutants, most notably the S41E and N45R mutants. Essentially similar results were obtained with either bacterially expressed, purified Cks1 derivatives (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6) or with the same mutants produced by IVTT (lanes 7–12), indicating the validity of results obtained with both types of Cks1 preparations. The results of similar experiments with a variety of Cks1 → Cks2 mutants are summarized in Table I, part A. All results were obtained with low, limiting concentrations of Cks1, in the linear range of the p27-ubiquitin ligation assay. Results were quantified and were expressed as the percentage of activity obtained with a similar concentration of wild-type Cks1. The small amount of p27-ubiquitin conjugates formed without Cks1 (see Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 7) was subtracted. We have first deleted the four C-terminal amino acid residues of Cks1, because three of these are different between Cks1 and Cks2 (Fig. 1 A). However, the resulting Δ75–79 mutant was as active as wild-type Cks1 in p27 ubiquitylation (Table I, part A). Similarly, mutations in residues 16, 26, and 27 had either no influence or only moderately decreased activity. There was some decrease in p27-ubiquitin ligation activity of the L31Q mutant, and this was more noticeable with the A29S,L31Q double Cks1 → Cks2 mutant. Drastic decrease of activity was observed with the S41E and N45R Cks1 → Cks2 mutants (Fig. 1 B and TableI, part A).Table IInfluence of amino acid replacements in Cks1 on p27-ubiquitin ligation by SCFSkp2% wild typePurifiedIVTTA.

Results are expressed as the percentage of activity obtained with a similar amount of wild-type Cks1. ND, not determined. Human Cks1 and Cks2 are functionally similar in their ability to replace the homologous protein in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (21Hadwiger J.A. Wittenberg C. Mendenhall M.D. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2034-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The only known functional difference between human Cks1 and Cks2 is the ability of the former to bind to Skp2 and to promote Skp2-mediated ubiquitylation. Therefore, it seemed reasonable to assume that the defect of specific Cks1 → Cks2 mutants in p27-ubiquitin ligation activity is due to their inability to bind to Skp2. We have tested this notion by direct assay of the binding of different 35S-labeled Cks1 mutants to Skp2. This assay included incubation of 35S-labeled Cks1 derivatives in the presence or absence of Skp2/Skp1, followed by immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against Skp2. We used Skp2-Skp1 complex instead of Skp2, because without Skp1, recombinant Skp2 is not expressed well in a soluble form in insect cells (6Carrano A.C. Eytan E. Hershko A. Pagano M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar). By using this assay, it was shown previously (18Ganoth D. Bornstein G., Ko, T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M. Hershko A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) that wild-type Cks1 binds strongly to Skp2-Skp1 complex but not to Skp1. We now find that the S41E and N45R Cks1 → Cks2 mutants, which are defective in p27-ubiquitin ligation (Table I), are also greatly decreased in binding to Skp2 ("

Fusion of the viral envelope requires the presence of both cholesterol and sphingolipids in the target membrane. This is suggestive of a possible involvement of sphingolipid-cholesterol microdomains, or “lipid rafts,” in the membrane fusion and cell entry process of the virus. In this study, large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared from synthetic sphingolipids and sterols that vary with respect to their capacity to promote microdomain formation, as assessed by gradient flotation analysis in the presence of Triton X-100. SFV and SIN fused with LUVs irrespective of the presence or absence of Triton X-100-insoluble microdomains. These results suggest that SFV and SIN do not require the presence of lipid rafts for fusion with target membranes. Furthermore, it is not necessary for sphingolipids to reside in a detergent-insoluble complex with cholesterol to promote SFV or SIN fusion.

Alphaviruses enter their host cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, a process that delivers the virus particles to the endosomal cell compartment.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 615-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), while in addition budding of SFV from the infected-cell surface appears to require Chol as well (15Kielian M. Chatterjee P.K. Gibbons D.L. Lu Y.E. Hilderson H. Fuller S. Subcellular Biochemistry-Fusion of Biological Membranes and Related Problems. 34.

Recently, it has been shown that low-pH-dependent fusion of the alphavirus SIN, similar to that of SFV, also requires the presence of Chol and sphingolipids in the target membrane (20Smit J.M. Bittman R. Wilschut J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8476-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests that a requirement for Chol and sphingolipids is a general characteristic of the membrane fusion activity of alphaviruses. For SFV, it has been shown that Chol mainly mediates the binding of the viral envelope to the target membrane, whereas sphingolipids are involved in the actual fusion event (13Nieva J.L. Bron R. Corver J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar,14Wilschut J. Corver J. Nieva J.L. Bron R. Moesby L. Reddy K.C. Bittman R. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1995; 12: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The dependence of SFV and SIN fusion on the presence of both Chol and sphingolipids in the target membrane is suggestive of a possible involvement of sphingolipid-Chol microdomains or “lipid rafts,” which are present in mammalian cellular membranes as small entities (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 22Pralle A. Keller P. Florin E.-L. Simons K. Hörber J.K.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 997-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). These lipid rafts are thought to exist in bilayers in the liquid-ordered Lo phase as complexes consisting of Chol and (glyco)sphingolipids with predominantly saturated acyl chains (23Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2546) Google Scholar). The extended conformation of the saturated acyl chains of (glyco)sphingolipids allows these lipids to pack optimally with Chol (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 24McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Needham D. Huang C.

Lipid rafts appear to be insoluble in non-ionic detergents such as Triton X-100 at 4 °C. Thus, lipid rafts can be isolated from cells as detergent-insoluble complexes (DICs), together with the proteins recruited into the rafts (26Brown D.A. Rose J.K. Cell. 1992; 68: 533-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2604) Google Scholar). There is extensive evidence for the function of lipid rafts in a variety of lipid and protein sorting events and signal transduction cascades (23Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Simian virus 40 (SV40) enters cells via caveolae, which are special invagination sites rich in lipid rafts (28Norkin L.C. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,29Parton R.G. Lindsay M. Immunol. Rev. 1999; 168: 23-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) also appears to use rafts as a platform for host cell entry (reviewed in Ref. 30Campbell S.M. Crowe S.M. Mak J. J. Clin. Virol. 2001; 22: 217-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Glycosphingolipids, which are abundantly present in lipid rafts, interact with the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 and are required for expression of viral membrane fusion activity (31Hammache D. Yahi N. Maresca M. Piéroni G. Fantini J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5244-5248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Hug P. Lin H.M.J. Korte T. Xiao X. Dimitrov D.S. Wang J.M. Puri A. Blumenthal R. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6377-6385Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that gp120 induces lateral reorganization of rafts, bringing complexes of gp120 with CD4, a receptor also present in rafts, together with rafts containing the chemokine co-receptor (33Mañes S. del Real G. Lacalle R.A. Lucas P. Gómez-Moutón C. Sánchez-Palomino S. Delgado R. Alcamı́ J. Mira E. Martı́nez-A C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). HIV-1 virions pass a barrier of mucosal epithelial cells by a process called transcytosis, which requires the presence of galactosylceramide in lipid rafts to mediate virion binding (34Alfsen A. Iniguez P. Bouguyon E. Bomsel M. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 6257-6265Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). To address the question as to whether lipid rafts are involved in the sphingolipid and Chol dependence of alphavirus fusion, we used synthetic sphingolipids and sterols that vary in their ability to support formation of DICs. We found that fusion of SFV and SIN is rapid and extensive in the absence or presence of DICs, indicating that fusion of these viruses does not require the sphingolipids to reside in raft-like microdomains with Chol. The fluorescent probe 16-(1-pyrenyl)hexadecanoic acid (pyrene fatty acid) was obtained from Molecular Probes Europe B.V. (Leiden, The Netherlands). Phosphatidylcholine (PC) from egg yolk, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) prepared by transphosphatidylation of egg PC, sphingomyelin (SPM) from brain tissue, N-oleoylceramide, and Chol were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). 5-Androsten-3β-ol, ergosterol, and stigmasterol were purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). N-Oleoyl-, N-stearoyl-, and N-elaidoyl-SPM were synthesized byN-acylation ofd-erythro-sphingosylphosphocholine with the corresponding p-nitrophenyl esters, as described previously (35Bittman R. Verbicky C.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2089-2093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). d-erythro-Sphingosylphosphocholine was prepared by acid-catalyzed methanolysis of egg SPM as described previously (35Bittman R. Verbicky C.A. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 2089-2093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 20(R)-Isooctyl-5-pregnen-3β-ol (abbreviated as C4-sterol) was synthesized as described before (36Chia N.-C. Vilchèze C. Bittman R. Mendelsohn R.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12050-12055Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). SFV and SIN TR339 were propagated on baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21) cultured in Glasgow's modification of Eagle's minimal essential medium (Invitrogen, Breda, The Netherlands), supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth, 200 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, and 7.5% sodium bicarbonate. Pyrene-labeled virus was isolated from the medium of infected BHK-21 cells, cultured beforehand in the presence of pyrene fatty acid, essentially as described previously (6Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bron R. Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Nieva J.L. Bron R. Corver J. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2797-2804Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20Smit J.M. Bittman R. Wilschut J. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8476-8484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, BHK-21 cells were grown in medium containing 15 μg of pyrene fatty acid/ml for 48 h. The cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 4. At 24 h postinfection, pyrene-labeled virus was harvested from the medium by ultracentrifugation in a Beckman type 19 rotor for 2.5 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. The particles were further purified by ultracentrifugation on a 20–50% (w/v) sucrose density gradient in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 16 h at 100,000 ×g at 4 °C. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) were prepared by a freeze-thaw/extrusion procedure (37Mayer L.D. Hope M.J. Cullis P.R. Janoff A.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 817: 193-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 38Hope M.J. Bally M.B. Webb G. Cullis P.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 812: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipid mixtures were dried from a chloroform-methanol solution under a stream of nitrogen and further dried under vacuum for at least 1 h. The lipid films were hydrated in 5 mm HEPES, 150 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) (HNE) and subjected to five cycles of freezing and thawing. Subsequently, the vesicles were sized by extrusion 21 times through a polycarbonate filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm (Nuclepore, Whatman, Clifton, NJ) in a mini-extruder (LiposoFast, Avestin, Ottawa, Canada). Radiolabeled LUVs were prepared as described above except a trace amount (1–1.5 μCi) of [7(n)-3H]Chol ([3H]Chol) (3.5 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) was added to the lipid mixtures before drying. DICs were isolated from LUVs (300 μm phospholipid) by treatment with 1% Triton X-100 (v/v, Sigma) in HNE buffer at 4 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the detergent-LUV mixture was mixed with 60% (w/v) Optiprep (Axis-Shield, Oslo, Norway) to a final concentration of 45% Optiprep in a final volume of 1 ml and placed on the bottom of an ultracentrifuge tube. For the isolation of DICs from LUVs containing [3H]Chol the LUV extract was overlaid with a 2.9-ml layer of 10% Optiprep (w/v) and 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in HNE, and a 1-ml layer of 5% Optiprep (w/v) and 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in HNE. The extracted LUVs were overlaid with a 1-ml layer of 15% Optiprep (w/v) and 1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in HNE, a second layer of 1.9-ml with 10% Optiprep (w/v) in HNE without Triton X-100, and a third layer of HNE alone. These gradients were used to minimize the interference of Triton X-100 in the phosphate assay and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis, which were used to determine the formation and content of DICs. The gradients were subjected to ultracentrifugation in a Beckman SW55 Ti rotor for 18 h at 100,000 × g at 4 °C. After centrifugation, fractions of 275 μl were collected, starting from the top of the gradient. Aliquots were removed to determine the amount of [3H]Chol in each fraction by liquid scintillation counting. When non-radiolabeled LUVs were used, the amount of phosphate present in the fractions was determined by a standard phosphate assay (39Böttcher C.J.F. van Gent C.M. Pries C. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1961; 24: 203-204Crossref Scopus (848) Google Scholar). To compare DIC formation with the different sterols used, the amount of phosphate present in the pooled fractions 4–8, the DIC-containing fractions, was determined by phosphate analysis after extraction of the lipids (40Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar). For the TLC analysis of the DICs, fractions 4–8 were pooled, and the lipids were extracted and spotted on silica gel 60 HPTLC plates (Merck) developed with CHCl3/MeOH/NH4OH (25% in water) 65:25:5 (v/v). The lipid spots were stained with iodine. Pyrene-labeled SFV or SIN (1 μmviral phospholipid) and LUVs (100 μm phospholipid) were mixed in 0.665 ml of HNE in a magnetically stirred and thermostatted (37 °C) quartz cuvette in an AB2 fluorometer (SLM/Aminco, Urbana, IL). Fusion was triggered by the addition of 35 μl of 0.1m MES, 0.2 m acetic acid, pretitrated with NaOH to achieve a final pH of 5.5 for SFV or 5.0 for SIN, and the decrease of pyrene excimer fluorescence intensity (excitation and emission at 340 and 480 nm, respectively) was monitored continuously. The fusion scale was calibrated such that 0% fusion corresponded to the initial excimer fluorescence intensity and 100% fusion to complete dilution of the probe (6Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Bron R. Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 13Nieva J.L.

To evaluate the presence of DICs in liposomes, LUVs consisting of PC/PE/SPM/Chol (molar ratio, 1:1:1:1.5) were treated with Triton X-100 at 4 °C and subjected to a density gradient flotation analysis, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” DICs floating to the top of a 45-10-5% Optiprep density gradient were detected by the [3H]Chol initially incorporated in the LUVs. With PC/PE/SPM/Chol LUVs, as much as 30% of the total amount of Chol present in the gradient floated to low density (Fig. 1 A). When SPM was excluded from the LUVs, no radiolabeled Chol was detected at the top of the gradient (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the effect of Chol on DIC formation we used the same flotation procedure, but with a slightly different gradient to avoid interference from Triton X-100 in the phospholipid determination assay. Again, efficient DIC formation was observed when both SPM and Chol were present in the LUVs (Fig. 1 C). Approximately 30% of the total amount of phospholipid was found in the floating DIC fraction. In the absence of Chol, no phospholipid was detected at the top of the gradient (Fig. 1 D). About 90% of the phospholipid in the DIC-containing fractions isolated from PC/PE/SPM/Chol/LUVs consisted of SPM, as determined by phospholipid analysis of the lipid spots separated by TLC (Fig. 2). PC and PE were largely excluded from these complexes, in agreement with the composition of cellular rafts reported previously (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 42Harder T. Simons K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar). We next used the flotation assay with [3H]Chol described above to assess the ability of synthetic SPMs with differentN-acyl chains to form DICs with Chol. These sphingolipid analogs were incorporated into LUVs with PC, PE, and Chol (molar ratio PC/PE/sphingolipid/Chol, 1:1:1:1.5). A high extent of DIC formation was observed with stearoyl and bovine brain SPMs (TableI); in the former the N-acyl chain is saturated, and in the latter the saturated:unsaturated acyl chain ratio is 93:7 (mol:mol) (43Avanti Polar Lipids (2001) Products Catalog, 6thEd., p. 58, Alabaster, AL.Google Scholar). On the other hand, whenN-oleoyl- or N-linoleoyl-SPM was incorporated in PC, PE, Chol bilayers, no flotation of [3H]Chol occurred. The latter SPMs have one and two cis unsaturated bonds, respectively, which interfere with an efficient alignment with Chol (21Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8051) Google Scholar, 24McIntosh T.J. Simon S.A. Needham D. Huang C.

These results are consistent with the recent findings of Samsonov et al. (44Samsonov A.V. Mihalyov I. Cohen F.S. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1486-1500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), who observed that rafts could not be formed with N-oleoyl-SPM in planar membranes, in contrast to egg SPM and N-stearoyl SPM. Table I also shows that when SPM has a trans C9-C10 double bond in the N-acyl chain (N-elaidoyl-SPM), 16% of the total [3H]Chol floated to a low density. Thus 18:1-Δ9-trans-SPM does assemble into microdomains with Chol to a limited extent, in contrast to the corresponding Δ9-cis-SPM.Table IFlotation of [3H]Chol after Triton X-100 extraction of LUVs containing different sphingolipidsSphingolipid[3H]Chol in DICs% of totalBrain SPM31.6 ± 2.2N-Stearoyl-SPM42.4 ± 2.0N-Elaidoyl-SPM16.0 ± 3.1N-Oleoyl-SPM0.1 ± 0.0N-Linoleoyl-SPM0.1 ± 0.0No sphingolipid0.1 ± 0.0LUVs contained PC, PE, sphingolipid, and Chol (molar ratio 1:1:1:1.5) and a trace amount of [3H]Chol.

Results represent an average of triplicate experiments. Next, we evaluated the ability of four different sterols (stigmasterol, ergosterol, androstenol, and C4-sterol) to support DIC formation in our model system. In other systems, these sterols had been shown to differ from one another with respect to their ability to participate in lipid raft formation (45Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilchèze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 46Xu X. London E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 843-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The sterols were incorporated into LUVs (PC/PE/SPM/sterol molar ratio of 1:1:1:1.5). Flotation analysis after extraction with Triton X-100 indicated that DICs were formed to a greater extent with stigmasterol and ergosterol than with Chol (Table II). A lower extent of DIC formation was observed with C4-sterol, whereas androstenol failed to support significant DIC formation. This observation is consistent with the report of Patra et al. (47Patra S.K. Alonso A. Arrondo J.L.R. Goñi F.M. J. Liposome Res. 1999; 9: 247-260Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar), who found that 16-androsten-3β-ol, which resembles the structure of androstenol (5-androsten-3β-ol), does not promote the formation of DICs in liposomes. The sterol dependence of DIC formation noted in Table II is also in accord with the results of Xu et al. (45Xu X. Bittman R. Duportail G. Heissler D. Vilchèze C. London E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33540-33546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) (see “Discussion”).Table IIFlotation of phospholipid after Triton X-100 extraction of LUVs containing different sterolsSterolPhospholipid in DICs% of totalCholesterol31.0 ± 3.3Stigmasterol40.9 ± 8.6Ergosterol41.2 ± 2.8Androstenol2.4 ± 3.4C4-sterol25.9 ± 2.1No sterol0.4 ± 0.6LUVs contained PC, PE, brain SPM, and sterol (molar ratio 1:1:1:1.5).

Results represent an average of triplicate experiments. To assess the potential correlation between the fusion of SFV and DIC formation in target liposomes, we studied the interaction of pyrene-labeled virus with LUVs containing different SPMs or sterols. The pyrene fusion assay monitors fusion on-line as a decrease of pyrene excimer fluorescence intensity upon dilution of pyrene-labeled phospholipids from the viral into the liposomal target membrane (6Wahlberg J.M. Bron R. Wilschut J. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7309-7318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,12Bron R. Wahlberg J.M. Garoff H. Wilschut J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). SFV underwent efficient fusion with LUVs containing Chol and SPM, irrespective of the degree of unsaturation of the SPM N-acyl chain. For example, very similar kinetics and extents of fusion were observed with LUVs containing either N-oleoyl-SPM or brain SPM (Fig. 3 A, curves a and b, respectively), whereas there was no fusion with PC/PE/Chol LUVs lacking SPM (Fig. 3 A, curve c). Fig. 4 A presents a survey of the extents of SFV fusion with LUVs containing various sphingolipids, together with PC, PE, and Chol. These sphingolipids included SPMs with different N-acyl chains as well asN-oleoylceramide. For reasons of comparison, Fig.4 A also presents the extents of DIC formation in these LUVs (black bars). Clearly, fusion of SFV was rapid and extensive with LUVs containing sphingolipids that lack the ability to assemble into DICs with Chol. This finding also holds for LUVs containingN-oleoylceramide, which fused extensively with SFV but did not form DICs. It is noteworthy that fusion supported byN-stearoyl-SPM, a DIC-promoting lipid, was slower (results not shown) and 20% less extensive than that supported by brain SPM (Fig. 4 A).Figure 4Lack of correlation between SFV fusion with LUVs and the degree of DIC formation in the LUVs.

https://openalex.org/W2046487370,"Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) are characterized by the conversion of a protease-sensitive host glycoprotein, prion protein or PrP-sen, to a protease-resistant form (PrP-res). PrP-res molecules that accumulate in the brain and lymphoreticular system of the host consist of three differentially glycosylated forms. Analysis of the relative amounts of the PrP-res glycoforms has been used to discriminate TSE strains and has become increasingly important in the differential diagnosis of human TSEs. However, the molecular basis of PrP-res glycoform variation between different TSE agents is unknown. Here we report that PrP-res itself can dictate strain-specific PrP-res glycoforms. The final PrP-res glycoform pattern, however, can be influenced by the cell and significantly altered by subtle changes in the glycosylation state of PrP-sen. Thus, strain-specific PrP-res glycosylation profiles are likely the consequence of a complex interaction between PrP-res, PrP-sen, and the cell and may indicate the cellular compartment in which the strain-specific formation of PrP-res occurs.

These strains differ biologically by differences in disease incubation times and neuropathology (11Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 822-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The existence of different TSE strains is difficult to explain in terms of a proteinaceous agent that shares the same amino acid sequence with a normal host protein. If PrP-res is the infectious agent, strain-specific information must be encoded within the PrP-res molecule either structurally or via post-translational modification. Interestingly, TSE strains can be defined by differences in the conformation, glycosylation, protease resistance, and aggregation state of PrP-res (7Caughey B.W. Dong A. Bhat K.S. Ernst D. Hayes S.F. Caughey W.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 7672-7680Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar, 12Caughey B. Raymond G.J. Bessen R.A. J. Biol.

Several lines of evidence demonstrate that PrP-res molecules associated with different TSE strains have distinct protein conformations. In two strains of hamster-adapted transmissible mink encephalopathy, treatment of PrP-res with proteinase K resulted in PrP-res molecules with different sizes. These size differences are due to strain-specific, conformational changes resulting in the exposure of different proteinase K cleavage sites (17Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2096-2101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Bessen R.A. Marsh R.F. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7859-7868Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This size difference could even be transmitted to newly formed PrP-res in vitro, demonstrating that the three-dimensional structure of PrP-res molecules can be self-propagated and suggesting a molecular basis for TSE strains (19Bessen R.A. Kocisko D.A. Raymond G.J. Nandan S. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1995; 375: 698-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear how conformational differences in the PrP-res molecules may relate to strain-specific disease phenotypes. PrP-res molecules associated with different TSE strains also differ in their relative amount of glycosylation. The prion protein contains twoN-linked glycosylation sites and is present in the cell in three different forms (high molecular mass glycoform, low molecular mass glycoform, and unglycosylated) that vary in the number and complexity of sugars added (20Endo T. Groth D. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8380-8388Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 21Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R.

It has been speculated that differences in PrP-res glycosylation may encipher strain-specific characteristics in vivo (22Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Recently, differences in PrP-res glycosylation have been used as specific markers for TSE strains as well as in support of the hypothesis that human CJD originates from bovine spongiform encephalopathy (22Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 23Parchi P. Capellari S. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Kopp N. Brown P.

Lantos P. Nature. 1997; 389: 448-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis of TSE strain-specific glycoform variability has remained elusive. Understanding how these strain-specific glycosylation differences in PrP-res are controlled would provide important insights into the existence of strains in a disease for which no nucleic acid genome has yet been identified. Several hypotheses have been forwarded to explain PrP-res glycosylation variability, including the following proposals: 1) different cells expressing differently glycosylated PrP-sen populations are targeted by different TSE strains (25Hecker R. Taraboulos A. Scott M. Pan K.M. Yang S.L. Torchia M. Jendroska K. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1213-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26DeArmond S.J. Sanchez H.

Neuron. 1997; 19: 1337-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); 2) the TSE agent directly alters the post-translational glycosylation of PrP-sen (21Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virol. 1999; 80: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar); 3) PrP-res itself dictates strain-specific PrP glycosylation (28Caughey B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). In this study we demonstrate that PrP-res can dictate its own glycosylation profile. The final PrP-res glycosylation profile is, however, influenced by the glycosylation state of PrP-sen as well as the cell in which the formation of PrP-res takes place. Our data suggest that although PrP-res is the primary determinant of its own glycosylation profile, subtle changes in the PrP-sen pool can modify the final glycosylation pattern of PrP-res. Thus, the glycosylation pattern of PrP-res in vivo may be indicative of the cellular environment and the glycosylation state of the PrP-sen pool present in this environment. Based on the fact that the PrP-res glycosylation pattern can be drastically changed depending upon the PrP-sen glycosylation state, our results also suggest that it is unlikely thatin vivo strain-specific phenotypes are enciphered in the carbohydrate moieties of PrP-res. The mouse-adapted scrapie strains ME7, 87V, and 22L were the kind gift of Dr. James Hope (Vitechnologies, Boston, MA) and were passaged once in C57BL/10 (ME7, 22L) or VmDk mice (87V). The mouse-adapted scrapie isolate RML Chandler (RML) was passaged in RML mice. Brains were stored at −80 °C, and brain homogenates (10% w/v) were prepared fresh in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing complete protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to a previously published protocol (29Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Mo3F4-MNB has been described previously (30Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These cells express high levels of mouse PrP-sen containing the epitope for the mouse monoclonal antibody 3F4 (31Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For cell lysates, Mo3F4-MNB cells were grown to confluence in 10% FBS/DMEM, rinsed twice in PBS, and scraped off the flask. Mo3F4-MNB cells treated with tunicamycin were washed twice with warm phosphate-buffered balanced salt, cultured in Opti-MEM for 1 h, and incubated with 8 μg/ml tunicamycin in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS for 4 h. Cells were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Harvested cells were subsequently homogenized (10% w/v) in PBS with protease inhibitors. Following addition of Triton X-100 and SDS to 0.5% and 0.05%, respectively, cleared cell lysates were used for the in vitro formation of PrP-res. Mo3F4-MNB cells were grown in 24-well microtiter plates. Cells were overlaid with 200 μl of a detergent-free brain homogenate diluted to 1% in Opti-MEM. After 4 h, 400 μl of 10% FBS/DMEM were added, and the cells were incubated for 96 h before being lysed in lysis buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Cell lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation and incubated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 60 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to a final concentration of 3 mm, and the samples were centrifuged at 356,000 ×g for 1 h at 4 °C. Pellets were sonicated into sample buffer (2.5% SDS, 3 mm EDTA, 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 5% glycerol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 63 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8), and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described previously (32Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). PrP was visualized using the enhanced chemifluorescence detection system (AmershamBiosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The relative amounts of the PrP-res glycoforms were quantified in terms of integrated peak volume using ImageQuant. For thein vitro formation of PrP-res, brain homogenates of healthy or scrapie-infected mice containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.05% SDS were mixed with a Mo3F4-MNB cell lysate at a ratio of 1:8. Samples were sonicated to break up PrP-res aggregates using a microsonic sonicator (Misonix) with the probe immersed in the sample. The samples were then incubated for 96 h at 37 °C with agitation. Following treatment with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 3 mm PMSF. Sample buffer was added, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Centrifugation of samples at 356,000 × g following proteinase K treatment did not significantly alter the PrP-res glycosylation profile (data not shown). Mo3F4-MNB cells were metabolically labeled, and Mo3F4 PrP-sen was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysate using the monoclonal antibody 3F4 as described previously (32Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For experiments that required purification of cell surface PrP-sen released from its glycophosphatidylinositol anchor, radiolabeled Mo3F4 MNB cells were treated with 14 units/ml phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PIPLC, ICN) as previously described (33Kocisko D.A. Come J.H. Priola S.A. Chesebro B. Raymond G.J. Lansbury P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1994; 370: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (786) Google Scholar). PrP-sen was then purified by immunoprecipitation from either the tissue culture supernatant (PIPLC-released PrP-sen) or from the cell lysate (cell-associated PrP-sen) using the monoclonal antibody 3F4. PrP-res (25 ng) isolated from mouse brain infected with scrapie strains 87V, ME7, or Obihiro (the kind gift of Dr. Motohiro Horiuchi, Obihiro University Department of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine, Hokkaido, Japan) was partially unfolded in 2.5 m guanidine hydrochloride and incubated with radiolabeled Mo3F4 PrP-sen in reaction buffer (0.75 m guanidine hydrochloride, 1.25% sarcosyl, 5 mm cetyl pyridinium chloride, and 50 mm sodium citrate buffer pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 48 h. One-tenth of the reaction was methanol-precipitated and served as a control for input PrP-sen. The remaining samples were incubated with 12 μg/ml proteinase K for 1 h at 37 °C. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of PMSF, and the proteins were methanol-precipitated. Radiolabeled products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified using the Storm PhosphorImager system (Amersham Biosciences). The relative intensities of the high molecular mass glycoforms were compared statistically using Dunn's Multiple Comparison Test. To study the molecular basis of PrP-res glycoform variation, we focused on four mouse-adapted scrapie strains: 87V, RML, 22L, and ME7 (11Bruce M.E. Br. Med. Bull. 1993; 49: 822-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). After treatment of scrapie brain homogenates with proteinase K, PrP-res molecules associated with different strains exhibited distinct proportions of the three differently glycosylated forms of PrP-res (34Somerville R.A. Chong A. Mulqueen O.U. Birkett C.R. Wood S.C. Hope J. Nature. 1997; 386: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). For example, the high molecular mass glycoform (Fig. 1 A, bracket) predominated in PrP-res associated with the strain 87V, whereas the low molecular mass glycoform (Fig. 1 A,asterisk) was more abundant in RML-associated PrP-res. In accordance with previously published protocols (22Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar, 34Somerville R.A. Chong A. Mulqueen O.U. Birkett C.R. Wood S.C. Hope J. Nature. 1997; 386: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), the PrP-res glycoform ratio for each strain was determined by comparing the high molecular mass glycoform to the low molecular mass glycoform (Fig. 1 B). Quantification of the relative intensities of the high molecular mass and low molecular mass glycoforms associated with each strain (Fig. 1 B) demonstrated that the brain-derived PrP-res glycoform profiles of RML and 87V strains significantly differed (p < 0.001), whereas the profiles for 22L and ME7 strains overlapped (p > 0.5). To analyze whether or not distinct PrP-res glycoform patterns could be produced in vitro, we developed a novel assay to monitor thede novo formation of PrP-res. In this assay, mouse neuroblastoma cells expressing high levels of 3F4 epitope-tagged mouse PrP-sen (Mo3F4-MNB) were lysed, and the lysate was mixed with brain homogenates from mice either infected with 87V, ME7, 22L, and RML scrapie or from an uninfected mouse. The 3F4 epitope (31Bolton D.C. Seligman S.J. Bablanian G. Windsor D. Scala L.J. Kim K.S. Chen C.M. Kascsak R.J. Bendheim P.E. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect newly generated 3F4-positive PrP-res. Thus, unlike in previously published protocols (29Saborio G.P. Permanne B. Soto C. Nature. 2001; 411: 810-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar, 35Bessen R.A. Raymond G.J. Caughey B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15227-15231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), newly formed glycosylated PrP-res can be detected by using a specific antibody that only reacts with epitope-tagged PrP and not with PrP molecules present in the brain homogenate. After 4 days, samples were assayed by Western blot for new PrP-res formation. Newly formed 3F4-positive PrP-res could be detected for each strain, whereas no PrP-res was detected when the cell lysate was mixed with the brain homogenate of an uninfected mouse (Fig.1 C). The glycoform ratio of newly formed PrP-res differed depending upon the scrapie strain. Strikingly, and consistent with brain-derived PrP-res, the RML and 87V PrP-res glycoform profiles were significantly different (p < 0.001) (Fig.1 D). In fact, for all strains the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res followed the same distribution on the graph as the brain-derived PrP-res glycosylation patterns (compare Fig. 1,B to D). Thus, distinct glycosylation profiles can be imposed on newly formed PrP-res in the absence of any cellular processes. These data suggest that the PrP-res present in the scrapie-infected brain homogenate dictates the PrP-res glycoform pattern. The glycosylation patterns generated in vitro did not exactly match the brain-derived PrP-res glycosylation patterns in that the unglycosylated PrP-res form was less abundant in PrP-res produced in vitro (compare Fig.1, A–C). This suggested that other factors could influence the final PrP-res glycosylation pattern. Because PrP-sen is the only other identified component in the formation of PrP-res, we reasoned that changes in the glycosylation state of PrP-sen could be influencing PrP-res glycosylation. To determine whether a change in the relative amounts of the different PrP-sen glycoforms could influence the strain-specific glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res, Mo3F4-MNB cells were incubated with tunicamycin. Tunicamycin blocksN-linked glycosylation and leads to a population of PrP-sen with an increased amount of the unglycosylated form. Quantification of the amount of unglycosylated PrP-sen present in normal and tunicamycin-treated cells revealed that the tunicamycin treatment led to an approximate 3-fold increase in the amount of unglycosylated PrP-sen in the total PrP-sen pool, although the high molecular mass and low molecular mass PrP-sen glycoforms were still most abundant (Fig.2 A). Cell lysates of tunicamycin-treated cells were then mixed with homogenates of scrapie-infected brain and assayed for newly formed PrP-res. Surprisingly, the slight increase in unglycosylated PrP-sen led to a drastic increase in unglycosylated PrP-res independent of the scrapie strain (Fig. 2 B, compare left andright panels). The distribution of the strain-specific glycosylation profiles on the graph remained unaltered, again demonstrating that PrP-res can dictate strain-specific glycoform profiles. However, the increase in unglycosylated PrP-res shifted the glycosylation profile lower (Fig. 2 C). Quantification of the three PrP-res forms demonstrated that the percentage of unglycosylated to total 3F4-positive PrP-res increased ∼5-fold (87V) to 6-fold (22L, ME7, and RML) when compared with PrP-res generated with normal, untreated cell lysate (Fig. 2 D). Thus, our data suggest that the PrP-res glycoform ratios observed in the brain could differ from those observed in vitro due to differences in the relative amounts of the PrP-sen glycoforms. Overall, our results clearly demonstrate that the relative amounts of the different PrP-sen glycoforms can strongly influence the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res. It was still possible that components in the cell lysates or brain homogenates other than PrP-sen and PrP-res were influencing strain-specific differences in PrP-res glycosylation patterns. To exclude this possibility, cell-free conversion assays were performed that utilized purified PrP-sen and PrP-res as described previously (32Raymond G.J. Hope J. Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond L.D. Bossers A. Ironside J. Will R.G. Chen S.G. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Rubenstein R. Smits M.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Nature. 1997; 388: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Radiolabeled Mo3F4 PrP-sen was immunoprecipitated from Mo3F4-MNB cells and mixed with highly purified PrP-res fractions isolated from the brains of mice infected with one of three mouse scrapie strains: 87V, ME7, or Obihiro (36Shinagawa M. Takahashi K. Sasaki S. Doi S. Goto H. Sato G. Microbiol. Immunol. 1985; 29: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). RML and 22L derived PrP-res were not tested because the PrP-res generated by these strains was variably truncated, and it was difficult to identify specific PrP-res glycoforms (30Kocisko D.A. Priola S.A. Raymond G.J. Chesebro B. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Caughey B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3923-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). 2S. A. Priola, unpublished results. Although the input PrP-sen was similar for all three strains (Fig.3 A,left panel), differences in the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res were observed (Fig. 3, A,right panel andB, compare Obihiro to 87V andME7). These differences were clearly dependent on the PrP-res input. Thus, no additional components were required to produce strain-specific differences in the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res demonstrating that PrP-res itself is capable of dictating strain glycoform variation. In vivo, following cellular uptake of the scrapie agent, PrP-res formation is believed to occur either on the cell surface of the infected cell or along the endocytic pathway (5Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that active cellular processes could also influence the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res. However, no currently available cell culture or transgenic mouse model is capable of detecting the rapid, de novo formation of fully glycosylated PrP-res. By utilizing Mo3F4-MNB cells, we have now established a cell culture system that allows the detection of acute PrP-res formation within 4 days after exposure to scrapie brain homogenate. 3I. Vorberg, unpublished data. To determine the influence of the cell on the glycoform pattern of newly formed PrP-res, intact Mo3F4-MNB cells were exposed for 4 days to brain homogenates from uninfected mice or from mice infected with one of the scrapie strains 87V, 22L, ME7, and RML. Newly formed 3F4-positive PrP-res was detected for all strains tested, although some background staining was also present in cells that were exposed to brain homogenate from uninfected mice (Fig.4 A). Exposure of the cells to the scrapie strains 22L, ME7, and 87V resulted in PrP-res glycosylation profiles that followed the same distribution on the graph compared with brain-derived PrP-res (compare Fig. 1 B to Fig.4 C). By contrast, the PrP-res glycosylation profile associated with RML scrapie was quite variable (Fig. 4 B), although the high molecular mass glycoforms (Fig. 4 A,brackets) generated in the tissue culture cells tended to be more prevalent than those in brain-derived RML PrP-res. The fact that the RML PrP-res glycosylation profile differed from the glycosylation profile obtained when a cell lysate was mixed with an RML brain homogenate (compare Fig. 1 D to Fig. 4 B) demonstrated that the cell is also capable of influencing the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res. Furthermore, these results also show that different scrapie strains can interact with one cell type and produce distinct PrP-res glycosylation patterns (Fig.4 C, compare 87V to 22L/ME7) and are in agreement with data published previously (37Birkett C.R. Hennion R.M. Bembridge D.A. Clarke M.C. Chree A. Bruce M.E. Bostock C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, although the cell can influence PrP-res glycosylation, different cell types are not required to produce strain-specific differences in PrP-res glycosylation patterns. The above results demonstrated that subtle changes in PrP-sen glycoform ratios as well as the cell could influence the PrP-res glycosylation profile. Together, these data suggested that the cell might influence strain-specific glycosylation patterns by determining the pool of PrP-sen to which PrP-res has access. To determine whether different cellular pools of PrP-sen could influence strain-specific glycosylation patterns dictated by PrP-res, two pools of PrP-sen were isolated: 1) cell-surface PrP-sen released from its glycophosphatidylinositol anchor using PIPLC, and 2) the pool of PrP-sen that remained associated with the cell following exposure to PIPLC. When the PrP-sen in these two pools was compared, the glycoform pattern of PIPLC-released PrP-sen differed subtly but significantly from that of cell-associated PrP-sen (Fig.5 A). Radiolabeled PrP-sen from both of these fractions was mixed in a cell-free conversion assay with purified PrP-res from 87V, ME7, or Obihiro scrapie-infected mice. The glycoform pattern of the newly formed PrP-res was then analyzed. PrP-res derived from PrP-sen released from the cell surface (SN, Fig. 5) had the same glycoform pattern as PrP-res derived from the unfractionated PrP-sen pool (Total, Fig.5). Thus, the lack of a glycophosphatidylinositol anchor in the PIPLC-released fraction did not affect PrP-res glycosylation patterns. However, for all three strains, small but significant differences were seen when the glycosylation pattern of newly formed PrP-res derived from PIPLC-released PrP-sen (SN) was compared with that of newly formed PrP-res derived from cell-associated PrP-sen (Fig. 5,B–D). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the cell may affect overall PrP-res glycosylation patterns by influencing the pool of PrP-sen with which PrP-res interacts. Thus, even small differences in the glycoform composition of PrP-sen isolated from different cellular compartments can modulate the relative amounts of the different PrP-res glycoforms. We have shown that TSE strain glycoforms are primarily determined by PrP-res but can be significantly influenced by PrP-sen. An interesting finding of this study was that the PrP-res glycosylation profile associated with RML scrapie generated in vitrodrastically differed from the PrP-res glycosylation profile obtained by mixing scrapie brain homogenate with cell lysate. These data demonstrate that the cell can also influence PrP-res glycoform profiles. However, it is unclear why the cell only strongly affected the glycosylation pattern of RML PrP-res. One possible explanation for this is that RML scrapie initiated PrP-res formation in mouse neuroblastoma cells in a different cellular compartment than the scrapie strains 22L, ME7, or 87V. Thus, in terms of the cellular biology of TSE diseases, our data suggest that the strain-specific glycosylation pattern of PrP-res could be indicative of the cellular compartment where PrP-res formation occurs for that strain. PrP-sen is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored cell-surface protein that is internalized and either recycled to the cell surface or degraded intracellularly (5Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol.

The relative amount of glycosylation appears to be dependent on the cellular localization of PrP-sen (Fig.5 A). Thus, strains that are associated in vivowith PrP-res molecules with a relatively high proportion of the unglycosylated form may induce the formation of PrP-res most effectively in a cellular compartment where this form is more prevalent. Conversely, strains in which glycosylated PrP is over-represented may convert PrP-sen to PrP-res in a cellular compartment with an abundance of glycosylated PrP-sen but lower levels of unglycosylated PrP-sen, such as the cell surface. This model of strain-specific glycosylation is supported by our data demonstrating that both the cell and the pool of PrP-sen can significantly change the PrP-res glycoform profile. In vitro studies have suggested that unglycosylated PrP-sen is preferentially converted to PrP-res (5Caughey B. Raymond G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18217-18223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, if PrP-res always prefers unglycosylated PrP-sen, this form should be equally present in PrP-res from different TSE strains. In vivo, however, this is clearly not the case as the amount of unglycosylated PrP-res can vary significantly from strain to strain (34Somerville R.A. Chong A. Mulqueen O.U. Birkett C.R. Wood S.C. Hope J. Nature. 1997; 386: 564Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). If PrP-res glycosylation patterns indicate where in the cell PrP-res formation occurs, this discrepancy could be explained by distinct TSE strains having differential access to unglycosylated PrP-sen. Thus, it would be the PrP-sen glycoforms present in the cellular microenvironments along the endocytic and/or secretory pathways where PrP-res formation occurs most efficiently (39McKinley M.P.

Virol. 1991; 65: 6597-6603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that determine the final PrP-res glycoform pattern. Alternatively, PrP-res glycosylation profiles may be indicative of the PrP-sen glycoform pattern of the brain area in which PrP-res is formed. In this instance, PrP-res glycosylation patterns could be the consequence of strains specifically targeting neuronal subsets with a PrP-sen glycosylation pattern that equals the final PrP-res glycosylation pattern associated with that strain (22Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Attempts to define PrP-sen glycosylation patterns in different brain areas have led to conflicting results, suggesting that any glycosylation differences between PrP-sen species in different brain regions may be subtle (27Somerville R.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1865-1872Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar,43Kuczius T. Groschup M.H. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 406-418Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These subtle differences could be sufficient to generate cell type-specific PrP-res glycosylation patterns. Indeed, our data demonstrate that even minor changes in the relative amounts of the different PrP-sen glycoforms can have a significant impact on the PrP-res glycosylation pattern (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, this model cannot explain how different scrapie strains can induce the formation of different PrP-res glycosylation patterns in the same cell line as observed in our study and by others (37Birkett C.R. Hennion R.M. Bembridge D.A. Clarke M.C. Chree A. Bruce M.E. Bostock C.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3351-3358Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). A direct influence of the TSE agent on post-translational cellular processes would explain how one cell type could support the formation of strain-specific PrP-res glycosylation patterns (21Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A. Dwek R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, our experiments demonstrate that neither active modulation of the cellular glycosylation process nor cellular degradation of specific PrP-res glycoforms is necessary for strain-specific differences in PrP-res glycosylation. Thus, although we cannot exclude the possibility that different cell types or an as yet unknown interaction of the TSE agent with cellular processes could influence PrP-res glycosylation, our data show that they are not necessary. It has been speculated that strain-specific biochemical and pathological properties are enciphered not only by the conformation of PrP-res but also by the attached carbohydrate moieties (22Collinge J. Sidle K.C. Meads J. Ironside J. Hill A.F. Nature. 1996; 383: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (1574) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrating that the relative amounts of the different PrP-sen glycoforms can strongly influence the strain-specific glycosylation profile of newly formed PrP-res suggest that this may not be the case. Furthermore, the PrP-res glycosylation profile of one strain can differ between brain areas and/or the brain and other organs like spleen and tonsil (45Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Kascsak R.J.

Meeker H. Sersen E. J. Gen. Virol. 1997; 78: 283-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the carbohydrate moieties on PrP-res are encoding any specific strain characteristic. We thank Drs. B. Chesebro, B. Caughey, K. Hasenkrug, and V.

A single gene encodes this enzyme, and adult mammalian muscles express a single gene variant, corresponding to the catalytic subunit of type T (AChET). At the post-translational level, the quaternary interactions introduce a considerable diversity of molecular forms that are characterized by distinct localization in cellular structures. These molecules include amphiphilic and nonamphiphilic homo-oligomers as well as hetero-oliogomers in which catalytic subunits are disulfide-linked with a hydrophobic “tail” in the membrane-bound globular forms or with a collagenous “tail” in the collagen-tailed or asymmetric forms of AChE (1Massoulié J.

Prior to innervation by motor nerve, the expression of muscle AChE is solely dependent on the state of myogenic differentiation, with the induction of AChE expression following the fusions of myoblasts to form elongated multinucleated myotubes.Myogenesis-induced AChE expression in muscle has been determined (13Toutant J.P.

Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the transcriptional activity of theACHE gene has also been proposed to play roles in regulating the AChE expression. By using a reporter-tagged construct of rat AChE promoter, the induction of AChE expression during myogenesis was shown to be mediated by the intronic E- and N-box motifs located on the ∼1.9-kb AChE promoter (18Angus L.M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of the possible AChE regulatory elements in muscle is the activation of intracellular cAMP synthesis; the gene regulation is mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (24Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (25Wan D.C.C. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, this cAMP-dependent pathway could explain the contrary regulation of AChE expression between avian and mammalian muscles in some physiological status (26Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The possible role of a cAMP-dependent pathway in regulating AChE expression during myogenesis was determined here. A reporter construct of the human AChE promoter was stably transfected into a mouse muscle cell line C2C12, and the expression of reporter was determined during the myotube formation. In addition, signaling molecules that might be involved in the cAMP-activated pathway were revealed during different stages of myogenic differentiation.DISCUSSIONIn the developing neuromuscular junctions, the regulation of muscle AChE expression can occur by two mechanisms: factors secreted from the presynaptic neuron during synaptogenesis and muscle intrinsic factors during myogenesis. Our results here suggest that muscle intracellular cAMP is one of the candidates to regulate the expression of AChE during early myogenic differentiation. The promoter element responsible for the cAMP-mediated AChE regulation is primarily the CRE site that locates at ∼2.2 kb upstream of the ATG start site of the human ACHE gene. As demonstrated in our studies, the presence of a high level of intracellular cAMP, PKA activity, and phosphorylated CREB during the myoblast stage suppress the transcriptional activity of the ACHE gene, which is mediated by the CRE site on the promoter. This suppressive effect is important, in particular, during the early myoblast stage. As the level of cAMP and the activities of its downstream signaling molecules decrease, simultaneously, myotubes start to form; the suppression on theACHE gene by cAMP-dependent signals is lost and, therefore, the transcript encoding AChE increases. Subsequently, the induction of AChE expression could be mediated by other transcriptional factors during the maturation of myotube. These promoter elements include Sp-1, Egr-1, and N- and E-box motifs, which have been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of the ACHE gene during the myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells (15Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Besides the role of promoter elements in AChE induction, the stability of AChE transcripts has also been proposed to account for at least part of the increase in AChE mRNA and, subsequently, the enzymatic activity during muscle maturation (17Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Although CRE sequence in general is a positive regulator in response to cAMP, the CRE site here on the human AChE promoter shows the opposite effect. The construct having only the CRE sequence, either pCRE-Luc from a commercial source or pCREHP-Luc from a sequence of human AChE promoter, when expressed in myoblasts showed an inductive response after the challenge of cAMP. The suppressive effect of the CRE site on the human AChE promoter is unique and depends on its specific location, which therefore may exert steric interference with positive transcriptional machinery on the promoter, such as the two adjacent E-box motifs. Several lines of evidence from our studies and other studies support this notion. First of all, different locations of genetic engineered CRE sequences on human AChE promoter, both 5′-end and 3′-end locations, showed an opposite effect as compared with the authentic site (i.e. positive regulation by cAMP). Moreover, the cAMP-mediated AChE expression in chick muscle was up-regulated by the CRE site instead of down-regulated as in the human promoter that we studied here (26Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggestion is also supported by the fact that the human promoter, either the ∼2.2 kb (25Wan D.C.C. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or just the very 5′-end 0.4 kb (Fig. 7), was up-regulated by cAMP when it was transfected into nonmuscle cells such as neuroblastoma cells. The muscle-specific suppressive response suggests the possible steric interference on the muscle-specific transcription machinery, such as the E-box motifs localized adjacent to the CRE site of the human AChE promoter.Besides the CRE site, which could mediate the cAMP-mediated AChE regulation, AP-2 is another regulatory element that could be regulated by cAMP signaling, although at lower magnitude. As shown in our study, the mutation on the CRE site (pAChEΔCRE-Luc) did not block completely the response of the promoter to cAMP. Indeed, AP-2 sites suppressed the AChE promoter activity in C2C12 myoblasts. This cAMP-mediated AP-2 activation in suppressing the activity of human AChE promoter could explain the suppressed promoter activity in CRE mutant (pAChEΔCRE-Luc)-transfected myoblasts during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Therefore, CRE and AP-2 sites could serve as suppressors on the human AChE promoter in responding to the high level of intracellular cAMP during the myoblast stage. This is crucial for the low expression of AChE in myoblast stage; in particular, myoblasts still contain a relatively high level of positive regulator(s) for AChE expression. However, AP-2 binding sequence itself when expressed in myoblasts showed a stimulative effect to cAMP challenge. A similar observation has been revealed in the suppressive role of AP-2 in regulating the human AChE promoter by Getman et al. (22Getman D.K. Mutero A. Inoue K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23511-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They have shown that the two AP-2 sites on the promoter could affect the basic transcription factor machinery, most likely by steric interference. In contrast, the activation of AP-2 in C2 myoblasts exerted a stimulative effect on the promoter activity ofTorpedo ACHE gene (19Ekström T.J. Klump W.M. Getman D. Karin M. Taylor P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the AP-2 site in regulating AChE gene expression is very similar to that of the CRE site. Both AP-2 and CRE sites could provide dual functions, either up- or down-regulation after activation, which must be dependent on its specific location on the promoter.The potential role of a cAMP-dependent pathway in regulating the process of myogenic differentiation of muscle has been studied extensively in past decade. It has been reported that the application of cAMP analogues inhibited the activation of muscle gene expression in the fusion-defective BC3H1 muscle cell line (38Hu J.S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19670-19677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of myogenin was negatively controlled by serum components, growth factors, and a cAMP- dependent mechanism (39Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jurs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit in 10T1/2 cells was shown to repress the transcription-activating function of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins including MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4 (40Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the application of a cAMP analogue reduced the myotube formation of C2 and L6 myogenic cell lines and repressed transactivation of muscle-specific genes by MyoD and Myf-5 (41Winter B. Braun T. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9869-9878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the continuous application of PKA inhibitor to rat satellite cells stimulated myogenesis and induced the myotube fusion, and the inhibitor also increased the expression of myogenin mRNA (42Lagord C. Leibovitch M.P. Carpentier G. Leibovitch S.A. Martelly I. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1996; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our cultures, the intracellular cAMP level of C2C12 cells was decreased by replacement of the differentiation medium. Although the nature of the cAMP inducer during myogenesis is not known, the decrease of cAMP may be a signal to trigger the differentiation process such as the induction of muscle-specific genes that includes the expression of AChE. Here, we have shown that the transcript and protein expression of myogenin and AChE were increased after the replacement with differentiation medium. Therefore, the elevated intracellular cAMP may inhibit the expression of such muscle-specific genes during myogenic differentiation, whereas the reduced cAMP level may induce the expression of these specific genes. Taken together, our findings on AChE regulation that depends on a dynamic change of cAMP signaling molecules during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myotubes are in line with the hypothesis that the intracellular cAMP inhibits the myogenic processes in muscle.Besides the role of cAMP in myogenic differentiation, the CGRP-induced AChE expression in cultured myotubes is also mediated by the activation of cAMP synthesis (10Choi R.C.Y.

Application of 0.5 μmCGRP onto cultured chick myotubes induced the accumulation of cAMP and, subsequently, induced the expression of AChE. In contrast, CGRP, at similar concentrations to that used in chick myotubes, played a suppressive role on AChE expression in mammalian C2 myotubes; the amount of AChE was reduced by 60% (43Boudreau-Larivière C. Jasmin B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This contrasting activation and repression of chick and mouse AChE expression in response to CGRP is due to a cAMP-dependent signaling mechanism (i.e. cAMP up-regulates the chick enzyme but down-regulates the mouse enzyme) (26Choi R.C.Y.

Although cAMP plays a suppressive role in AChE expression in mouse C2C12 myotube formation, a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway in regulating the expression of AChE during myogenesis process in chick system has not been determined. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE1; EC 3.1.1.7) is a highly polymorphic enzyme, and its localization at the neuromuscular junctions is in different manners of attachment (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S.

A single gene encodes this enzyme, and adult mammalian muscles express a single gene variant, corresponding to the catalytic subunit of type T (AChET). At the post-translational level, the quaternary interactions introduce a considerable diversity of molecular forms that are characterized by distinct localization in cellular structures. These molecules include amphiphilic and nonamphiphilic homo-oligomers as well as hetero-oliogomers in which catalytic subunits are disulfide-linked with a hydrophobic “tail” in the membrane-bound globular forms or with a collagenous “tail” in the collagen-tailed or asymmetric forms of AChE (1Massoulié J.

Biochem. 1999; 264: 672-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The collagen-tailed (ColQ) molecules are tethered in the basal lamina and are largely responsible for the high concentration of AChE at the neuromuscular junctions (1Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Vallette F-M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar,5McMahan U.J. Sanes J.R. Marshall L.M. Nature. 1978; 271: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In mature skeletal muscle, AChE is restricted to the neuromuscular junctions at a density of ∼650–2500 sites/μm2 (6Anglister L. Stiles J.R. Salpeter M.M. Neuron. 1994; 12: 783-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), which is mediated by agrin that induces the aggregation of preexisting AChE and acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) under the motor nerve (7Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). In addition, motor nerve provides trophic factors to regulate the postsynaptic AChE expression in muscle; these neural factors include calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) that increases the synthesis of cAMP (8Fontaine B.

Prior to innervation by motor nerve, the expression of muscle AChE is solely dependent on the state of myogenic differentiation, with the induction of AChE expression following the fusions of myoblasts to form elongated multinucleated myotubes. Myogenesis-induced AChE expression in muscle has been determined (13Toutant J.P. Reprod. Nutr. Dev. 1988; 28: 693-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 14Legay C. Huchet M. Massoulié J.

Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the transcriptional activity of theACHE gene has also been proposed to play roles in regulating the AChE expression. By using a reporter-tagged construct of rat AChE promoter, the induction of AChE expression during myogenesis was shown to be mediated by the intronic E- and N-box motifs located on the ∼1.9-kb AChE promoter (18Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Several other regulatory elements within the AChE promoter have also been reported to regulate the transcriptional activity of the ACHE gene inTorpedo (19Ekström T.J. Klump W.M. Getman D. Karin M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 21078-21084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). One of the possible AChE regulatory elements in muscle is the activation of intracellular cAMP synthesis; the gene regulation is mediated by a cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (24Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Tsim K.W.K. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 801-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) (25Wan D.C.C. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In addition, this cAMP-dependent pathway could explain the contrary regulation of AChE expression between avian and mammalian muscles in some physiological status (26Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The possible role of a cAMP-dependent pathway in regulating AChE expression during myogenesis was determined here. A reporter construct of the human AChE promoter was stably transfected into a mouse muscle cell line C2C12, and the expression of reporter was determined during the myotube formation. In addition, signaling molecules that might be involved in the cAMP-activated pathway were revealed during different stages of myogenic differentiation. DISCUSSIONIn the developing neuromuscular junctions, the regulation of muscle AChE expression can occur by two mechanisms: factors secreted from the presynaptic neuron during synaptogenesis and muscle intrinsic factors during myogenesis. Our results here suggest that muscle intracellular cAMP is one of the candidates to regulate the expression of AChE during early myogenic differentiation. The promoter element responsible for the cAMP-mediated AChE regulation is primarily the CRE site that locates at ∼2.2 kb upstream of the ATG start site of the human ACHE gene. As demonstrated in our studies, the presence of a high level of intracellular cAMP, PKA activity, and phosphorylated CREB during the myoblast stage suppress the transcriptional activity of the ACHE gene, which is mediated by the CRE site on the promoter. This suppressive effect is important, in particular, during the early myoblast stage. As the level of cAMP and the activities of its downstream signaling molecules decrease, simultaneously, myotubes start to form; the suppression on theACHE gene by cAMP-dependent signals is lost and, therefore, the transcript encoding AChE increases. Subsequently, the induction of AChE expression could be mediated by other transcriptional factors during the maturation of myotube. These promoter elements include Sp-1, Egr-1, and N- and E-box motifs, which have been shown to regulate the transcriptional activity of the ACHE gene during the myogenic differentiation in C2C12 cells (15Mutero A. Camp S. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1866-1872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 18Angus L.M. Chan R.Y. Jasmin B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17603-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Besides the role of promoter elements in AChE induction, the stability of AChE transcripts has also been proposed to account for at least part of the increase in AChE mRNA and, subsequently, the enzymatic activity during muscle maturation (17Fuentes M.E. Taylor P. Neuron. 1993; 10: 679-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar).Although CRE sequence in general is a positive regulator in response to cAMP, the CRE site here on the human AChE promoter shows the opposite effect. The construct having only the CRE sequence, either pCRE-Luc from a commercial source or pCREHP-Luc from a sequence of human AChE promoter, when expressed in myoblasts showed an inductive response after the challenge of cAMP. The suppressive effect of the CRE site on the human AChE promoter is unique and depends on its specific location, which therefore may exert steric interference with positive transcriptional machinery on the promoter, such as the two adjacent E-box motifs. Several lines of evidence from our studies and other studies support this notion. First of all, different locations of genetic engineered CRE sequences on human AChE promoter, both 5′-end and 3′-end locations, showed an opposite effect as compared with the authentic site (i.e. positive regulation by cAMP). Moreover, the cAMP-mediated AChE expression in chick muscle was up-regulated by the CRE site instead of down-regulated as in the human promoter that we studied here (26Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This suggestion is also supported by the fact that the human promoter, either the ∼2.2 kb (25Wan D.C.C. Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 288: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or just the very 5′-end 0.4 kb (Fig. 7), was up-regulated by cAMP when it was transfected into nonmuscle cells such as neuroblastoma cells. The muscle-specific suppressive response suggests the possible steric interference on the muscle-specific transcription machinery, such as the E-box motifs localized adjacent to the CRE site of the human AChE promoter.Besides the CRE site, which could mediate the cAMP-mediated AChE regulation, AP-2 is another regulatory element that could be regulated by cAMP signaling, although at lower magnitude. As shown in our study, the mutation on the CRE site (pAChEΔCRE-Luc) did not block completely the response of the promoter to cAMP. Indeed, AP-2 sites suppressed the AChE promoter activity in C2C12 myoblasts. This cAMP-mediated AP-2 activation in suppressing the activity of human AChE promoter could explain the suppressed promoter activity in CRE mutant (pAChEΔCRE-Luc)-transfected myoblasts during the myogenic differentiation of C2C12 cells. Therefore, CRE and AP-2 sites could serve as suppressors on the human AChE promoter in responding to the high level of intracellular cAMP during the myoblast stage. This is crucial for the low expression of AChE in myoblast stage; in particular, myoblasts still contain a relatively high level of positive regulator(s) for AChE expression. However, AP-2 binding sequence itself when expressed in myoblasts showed a stimulative effect to cAMP challenge. A similar observation has been revealed in the suppressive role of AP-2 in regulating the human AChE promoter by Getman et al. (22Getman D.K. Mutero A. Inoue K. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23511-23519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). They have shown that the two AP-2 sites on the promoter could affect the basic transcription factor machinery, most likely by steric interference. In contrast, the activation of AP-2 in C2 myoblasts exerted a stimulative effect on the promoter activity ofTorpedo ACHE gene (19Ekström T.J. Klump W.M. Getman D. Karin M. Taylor P. DNA Cell Biol. 1993; 12: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of the AP-2 site in regulating AChE gene expression is very similar to that of the CRE site. Both AP-2 and CRE sites could provide dual functions, either up- or down-regulation after activation, which must be dependent on its specific location on the promoter.The potential role of a cAMP-dependent pathway in regulating the process of myogenic differentiation of muscle has been studied extensively in past decade. It has been reported that the application of cAMP analogues inhibited the activation of muscle gene expression in the fusion-defective BC3H1 muscle cell line (38Hu J.S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19670-19677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of myogenin was negatively controlled by serum components, growth factors, and a cAMP- dependent mechanism (39Salminen A. Braun T. Buchberger A. Jurs S. Winter B. Arnold H.H. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 905-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The overexpression of the PKA catalytic subunit in 10T1/2 cells was shown to repress the transcription-activating function of the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins including MyoD, myogenin, Myf-5, and MRF4 (40Li L. Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the application of a cAMP analogue reduced the myotube formation of C2 and L6 myogenic cell lines and repressed transactivation of muscle-specific genes by MyoD and Myf-5 (41Winter B. Braun T. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9869-9878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the continuous application of PKA inhibitor to rat satellite cells stimulated myogenesis and induced the myotube fusion, and the inhibitor also increased the expression of myogenin mRNA (42Lagord C. Leibovitch M.P. Carpentier G. Leibovitch S.A. Martelly I. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1996; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our cultures, the intracellular cAMP level of C2C12 cells was decreased by replacement of the differentiation medium. Although the nature of the cAMP inducer during myogenesis is not known, the decrease of cAMP may be a signal to trigger the differentiation process such as the induction of muscle-specific genes that includes the expression of AChE. Here, we have shown that the transcript and protein expression of myogenin and AChE were increased after the replacement with differentiation medium. Therefore, the elevated intracellular cAMP may inhibit the expression of such muscle-specific genes during myogenic differentiation, whereas the reduced cAMP level may induce the expression of these specific genes. Taken together, our findings on AChE regulation that depends on a dynamic change of cAMP signaling molecules during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myotubes are in line with the hypothesis that the intracellular cAMP inhibits the myogenic processes in muscle.Besides the role of cAMP in myogenic differentiation, the CGRP-induced AChE expression in cultured myotubes is also mediated by the activation of cAMP synthesis (10Choi R.C.Y.

Zhou J. James G. Heller-Harrison R. Czech M.P. Olson E.N. Cell. 1992; 71: 1181-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the application of a cAMP analogue reduced the myotube formation of C2 and L6 myogenic cell lines and repressed transactivation of muscle-specific genes by MyoD and Myf-5 (41Winter B. Braun T. Arnold H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9869-9878Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the continuous application of PKA inhibitor to rat satellite cells stimulated myogenesis and induced the myotube fusion, and the inhibitor also increased the expression of myogenin mRNA (42Lagord C. Leibovitch M.P. Carpentier G. Leibovitch S.A. Martelly I. Cell Biol. Toxicol. 1996; 12: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our cultures, the intracellular cAMP level of C2C12 cells was decreased by replacement of the differentiation medium. Although the nature of the cAMP inducer during myogenesis is not known, the decrease of cAMP may be a signal to trigger the differentiation process such as the induction of muscle-specific genes that includes the expression of AChE. Here, we have shown that the transcript and protein expression of myogenin and AChE were increased after the replacement with differentiation medium. Therefore, the elevated intracellular cAMP may inhibit the expression of such muscle-specific genes during myogenic differentiation, whereas the reduced cAMP level may induce the expression of these specific genes. Taken together, our findings on AChE regulation that depends on a dynamic change of cAMP signaling molecules during myogenic differentiation of C2C12 myotubes are in line with the hypothesis that the intracellular cAMP inhibits the myogenic processes in muscle. Besides the role of cAMP in myogenic differentiation, the CGRP-induced AChE expression in cultured myotubes is also mediated by the activation of cAMP synthesis (10Choi R.C.Y. Yung L.Y. Dong T.T.X.

Application of 0.5 μmCGRP onto cultured chick myotubes induced the accumulation of cAMP and, subsequently, induced the expression of AChE. In contrast, CGRP, at similar concentrations to that used in chick myotubes, played a suppressive role on AChE expression in mammalian C2 myotubes; the amount of AChE was reduced by 60% (43Boudreau-Larivière C. Jasmin B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This contrasting activation and repression of chick and mouse AChE expression in response to CGRP is due to a cAMP-dependent signaling mechanism (i.e. cAMP up-regulates the chick enzyme but down-regulates the mouse enzyme) (26Choi R.C.Y.

Although cAMP plays a suppressive role in AChE expression in mouse C2C12 myotube formation, a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway in regulating the expression of AChE during myogenesis process in chick system has not been determined.

https://openalex.org/W1975980654,"Overexpression of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan biglycan (BGN) in fibrosis and desmoplasia results from enhanced activity of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). In pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the tumor cells themselves may contribute to BGN synthesis in vivo, since 8 of 18 different pancreatic carcinoma cell lines constitutively expressed BGN mRNA, as shown by reverse transcription-PCR analysis. In PANC-1 cells, TGF-β1 dramatically stimulated BGN mRNA accumulation through a BGN transcription-independent, cycloheximide-sensitive mechanism and strongly increased the synthesis and release of the proteoglycan form of BGN. The ability of TGF-β1 to induce BGN mRNA was critically dependent on Smad signaling, since 1) the up-regulation of BGN mRNA was preceded by a marked increase in Smad2 phosphorylation in TGF-β1-treated PANC-1 cells, 2) TGF-β1 was unable to induce BGN mRNA in pancreatic carcinoma cell lines that carry homozygous deletions of the Smad4/DPC4 gene, 3) inhibition of the Smad pathway in PANC-1 cells by transfection with a dominant negative Smad4/DPC4 mutant significantly reduced TGF-β1-induced BGN mRNA expression, 4) stable reintroduction of wild type Smad4/DPC4 into Smad4-null CFPAC-1 cells restored the TGF-β1 effect, and 5) overexpression of Smad2 and Smad3 in PANC-1 cells augmented TGF-β1 induction of BGN mRNA, whereas forced expression of Smad7, an inhibitory Smad, effectively blocked it. These results clearly show that a functional Smad pathway is crucial for TGF-β regulation of BGN mRNA expression. Since BGN has been shown to inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer cells, the Smad4/DPC4 mediation of the TGF-β effect may represent a novel tumor suppressor function for Smad4/DPC4: antiproliferation via expression of autoinhibitory BGN."
https://openalex.org/W1968907596,"RGS proteins comprise a large family of proteins named for their ability to negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling. RGS6 is a member of the R7 RGS protein subfamily endowed with DEP (disheveled, Egl-10,pleckstrin) and GGL (G proteingamma subunit-like) domains in addition to the RGS domain present in all RGS proteins. RGS6 exists in multiple splice variant forms with identical RGS domains but possessing complete or incomplete GGL domains and distinct N- and C-terminal domains. Here we report that RGS6 interacts with SCG10, a neuronal growth-associated protein. Using yeast two-hybrid analysis to map protein interaction domains, we identified the GGL domain of RGS6 as the SCG10-interacting region and the stathmin domain of SCG10 as the RGS6-interacting region. Pull-down studies in COS-7 cells expressing SCG10 and RGS6 splice variants revealed that SCG10 co-precipitated RGS6 proteins with complete GGL domains but not those with incomplete GGL domains, andvice versa. Expression of SCG10-interacting forms of RGS6 with SCG10 in PC12 or COS-7 cells resulted in co-localization of both proteins. RGS6 potentiated the ability of SCG10 to disrupt microtubule organization in PC12 and COS-7 cells. Furthermore, expression of SCG10 and RGS6 each enhanced NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation, and co-expression of SCG10 with RGS6 produced synergistic effects on NGF-induced PC12 differentiation. These effects of RGS6 on microtubules and neuronal differentiation were observed only with RGS6 proteins with complete GGL domains. Mutation of a critical residue required for interaction of RGS proteins with G proteins did not affect the ability of RGS6 to induce neuronal differentiation. These findings identify SCG10 as a binding partner for the GGL domain of RGS6 and provide the first evidence for regulatory effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation.

These proteins were defined originally by the presence of a homologous domain of ∼120 amino acids called the RGD. RGS proteins, or their RGDs, bind in vitro to Gα subunits of Gi and Gq family members and enhance their intrinsic GTPase activity, i.e.accelerating the mechanism that inactivates Gα subunits and terminating intracellular signaling by both Gα and Gβγ subunits. These and other studies suggest that RGS proteins regulate G protein signaling by functioning as GAPs for Gα subunits (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It must be acknowledged, however, that such a role has been demonstrated in mammals in vivo only for RGS9, whose GAP activity is required for the normal inactivation of transducin during phototransduction in retina (4Chen C.K. Burns M.E., He, W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar).Implicit in the proposed function of RGS proteins is their localization at the plasma membrane where G proteins and their activating receptors are found. Yet, recent studies in our laboratory (5Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that several RGS proteins are localized in the nucleus or at intracellular sites other than the plasma membrane, suggesting that some RGS proteins may possess functions other than regulatory actions on G protein signaling. Indeed, we recently reported that a member of the RGS12 family is a nuclear matrix protein and transcriptional repressor (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).RGS6 belongs to a subfamily of RGS proteins including RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Proteins in this family all possess a DEP (disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin homology) and a GGL (G gamma subunit-like) domain (8Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S.

Recently, we identified 20 splice variant forms of RGS6 and demonstrated differences in their subcellular localization patterns that were related to structural differences in the proteins. 2T. K. Chatterjee, Z. Liu, and R. A. Fisher, manuscript submitted. 2T. K. Chatterjee, Z. Liu, and R. A. Fisher, manuscript submitted. We found that N-terminal sequences and the GGL domain function as cytoplasmic retention sequences and that splice variants lacking both of these domains localized exclusively in the nucleus. The structural complexity and diverse subcellular localization patterns of RGS6 proteins raises the possibility that RGS6 variants may have functions distinct from or in addition to effects on G protein signaling. RGS6 transcripts are expressed predominantly in brain although the functional role of these proteins remains unknown.To identify and isolate proteins that interact with RGS6, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that SCG10, a neuronal growth-associated protein, interacted strongly with RGS6. SCG10 belongs to the stathmin protein family, all members of which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics by destabilizing microtubules (11Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SCG10 expression is high in the developing central nervous system and then dramatically decreases in adults (12Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K., Lo, L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both endogenous SCG10 in PC12 cells and ectopically expressed SCG10 are localized in the Golgi complex (13Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SCG10 in PC12 cells enhances neurite outgrowth (14Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B., Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), an indicator of neuronal differentiation.Here we show that the GGL domain of RGS6 is an SCG10-interacting region and the stathmin domain of SCG10 as the RGS6-interacting region. Co-expression of RGS6L with SCG10 resulted in their co-localization and promoted disruption of the microtubule network in COS-7 and PC12 cells. Both RGS6 and SCG10 enhance PC12 cell differentiation induced by NGF treatment and co-expression of SCG10 with RGS6 produced a synergistic effect on NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Effects of RGS6 on microtubules and neuronal differentiation were observed only with RGS6 proteins with complete GGL domains while an RGS6 protein mutant incapable of interacting with G proteins induced neuronal differentiation like wild type RGS6. This work defines a new role of the GGL domain of RGS proteins as a protein interaction domain for SCG10 and new evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that RGS6 induces neuronal differentiation by a novel mechanism involving interaction of SCG10 with its GGL domain and independent of RGS6 interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins.DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates specific interaction between RGS6 and SCG10 and further delineates the structural determinants for this interaction on both proteins. The GGL domain of RGS6 and the stathmin domain of SCG10 are the regions required for their high affinity interaction. RGS6 and SCG10 co-localized in cells expressing both proteins and their co-expression altered the patterns of subcellular localization observed when the proteins were expressed individually. This is the first evidence for RGS6 interaction with a protein other than a G protein α or β subunit. RGS6 co-expression with SCG10 produced a dramatic depletion of the microtubule network, perhaps in part due to its ability to promote delocalization of SCG10 from the Golgi complex. Both RGS6 and SCG10 enhanced PC12 cell differentiation induced by NGF treatment and were present in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells. Moreover, co-expression of SCG10 with RGS6L but not RGS6L(−GGL) produced a synergistic effect on NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Particularly noteworthy is our finding that the ability of RGS6 to promote neuronal differentiation is independent of interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins. This work defines a new role of the GGL domain of RGS proteins as a protein interaction domain for SCG10, the first evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation and the second example of G protein-independent actions of an RGS protein (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).RGS6 is a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins that also include RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Northern and in situ hybridization studies have shown a predominant expression of these proteins in brain, while RGS9 also is expressed in the retina (8Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F.

Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), however the precise role of R7 subfamily members in brain has not been established. All members of this family possess a DEP domain and a GGL domain in addition to the semiconserved RGD. Although the role of the DEP domain is not known, the GGL domain has been shown to represent a binding site for an atypical Gβ subunit, Gβ5, whose expression is also limited to the brain (22Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes of Gβ5 with RGS6, RGS7, and RGS9 have been isolated from brain or retina (23Zhang J.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that Gβ5 interaction with RGS7 decreased the affinity of RGS7 to Gαo without affecting its GAP activity toward Gαo and that expression of RGS7 and Gβ5 in cells inhibited M3 muscarinic receptor-induced calcium mobilization mediated by Gαq (24Witherow D.S.

Complexes of RGS11·Gβ5 and RGS7·Gβ5 exhibit GAP activity toward the Gαo subunit in vitro (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A role for Gβ5 interaction with RGS9 in enhancing the GAP activity of cGMP phosphodiesterase toward transducin has been shown, although part of this effect is independent of the GGL domain of RGS9 (27He W., Lu, L. Zhang X., El- Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gβ5 binding to RGS proteins may increase the stability of both proteins by post-transcriptional mechanisms (24Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The GGL domain of RGS7 diverges from that of other RGS proteins in that it contains PEST sequences that target proteins for degradation (28Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Polycystin binds to the GGL domain of RGS7 and prevents RGS7 degradation (28Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), however no other RGS proteins have been shown to bind to polycystin. The physiological importance of polycystin·RGS7 interaction is unclear.Our findings show that SCG10 represents a GGL domain-binding partner for RGS6 and that this interaction has synergistic effects on NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells to neurons. This provides the first evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation and for functional activities of RGS6 distinct from regulatory effects on G protein signaling. This latter conclusion is based upon our finding that RGS6L but not RGS6L(−GGL) enhanced SCG10-mediated microtubule destabilization and differentiation of PC12 cells, although both RGS6 splice forms possess the RGD needed for the GAP activity of these proteins toward Gα subunits (29Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that a mutation of a critical Asn in RGS6L required for RGS protein binding to and GAP activity toward Gα subunits, had no effects on its ability to promote neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Posner et al. (26Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant RGS6L exhibited GAP activity toward Gαo in vitro. Thus, it is possible that RGS6 may represent a multifunctional RGS protein capable of interactions with different proteins by different protein modules. Perhaps the particularly complex splicing of RGS6 transcripts serves to confer or limit protein interactions and signaling activities of members of the RGS6 protein family.While this work was in progress, Nixon et al. (30Nixon A.B. Grenningloh G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18127-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported identification of SCG10 as a binding partner for RGSZ1 using the RGS domain of RGSZ1 as bait. Subsequent GST protein pull-down studies showed that the N terminus of RGSZ1 (1–86) and SCG10 (1–34) were required for their interaction. RGSZ1 does not possess a GGL domain, and its site of binding on SCG10 is outside of the stathmin domain and is unique to SCG10. Analysis of in vitro microtubule polymerization/depolymerization showed that binding of RGSZ1 to SCG10 blocked the ability of SCG10 to induce microtubule disassembly. These results are quite different from those obtained in terms of the structural features required for protein interactions between RGS6 and SCG10 and the effects of this interaction on microtubule dynamics, where we found that RGS6 produced a synergistic effect on SCG10 induced microtubule disruption using intact cells.The precise mechanism by which RGS6 enhances differentiation of PC12 cells cannot be determined from the present studies. SCG10 is a brain-specific member of the stathmin protein family, all members of which share a common stathmin domain possessing microtubule-depolymerizing activity (11Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present evidence for strong interactions of RGS6 with this domain raises the possibility that RGS6 may affect this stathmin domain function by direct interactions. Indeed, it is believed that SCG10 enhances neurite outgrowth by increasing the dynamic instability of microtubules in the growth cone (14Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B., Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How Golgi complex-associated SCG10 gets transported to the growth cone and exerts this activity remains an open question. Our finding that co-expression of RGS6 and SCG10 disrupted the subcellular localization of both proteins may be relevant to how these proteins produce synergistic effects on microtubule disruption and NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Certainly, the finding that both proteins are localized in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells is consistent with a role in neurite outgrowth. Our results do show that RGS6 induces neuronal differentiation by a novel mechanism involving interaction of SCG10 with its GGL domain and independent of RGS6 interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins.The present results raise intriguing questions concerning the physiological role of RGS6 in brain. Expression of SCG10 is developmentally regulated, with high levels of expression observed in embryonic and postnatal brain (12Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K., Lo, L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our finding that interaction of RGS6 and SCG10 is mediated via their GGL and stathmin domains, respectively, raises the possibility that RGS6 may interact with other members of the stathmin protein family and that other members of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins may have similar protein interactions and functional effects on neuronal differentiation. Further studies will be required to evaluate the protein: protein interactions, possible mutual regulation between these two protein families and the role of this interaction in neuronal differentiation and development. It is intriguing that RGS6 transcripts undergo complex alternative splicing to generate at least twenty splice forms of RGS62 with ten of these forms predicted to be incapable of interacting with SCG10 due to splicing within the GGL domain. Hopefully, the present work will facilitate studies to reveal the likely complex functional roles of the RGS6 protein family in brain. RGS1 proteins comprise a family of more than 20 members named for their ability to negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein signaling (1Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3871-3874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, 2Burgon P.G. Lee W.L. Nixon A.B. Peralta E.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32828-32834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). These proteins were defined originally by the presence of a homologous domain of ∼120 amino acids called the RGD. RGS proteins, or their RGDs, bind in vitro to Gα subunits of Gi and Gq family members and enhance their intrinsic GTPase activity, i.e.accelerating the mechanism that inactivates Gα subunits and terminating intracellular signaling by both Gα and Gβγ subunits. These and other studies suggest that RGS proteins regulate G protein signaling by functioning as GAPs for Gα subunits (3Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). It must be acknowledged, however, that such a role has been demonstrated in mammals in vivo only for RGS9, whose GAP activity is required for the normal inactivation of transducin during phototransduction in retina (4Chen C.K. Burns M.E., He, W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Implicit in the proposed function of RGS proteins is their localization at the plasma membrane where G proteins and their activating receptors are found. Yet, recent studies in our laboratory (5Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24013-24021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29660-29671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) revealed that several RGS proteins are localized in the nucleus or at intracellular sites other than the plasma membrane, suggesting that some RGS proteins may possess functions other than regulatory actions on G protein signaling. Indeed, we recently reported that a member of the RGS12 family is a nuclear matrix protein and transcriptional repressor (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). RGS6 belongs to a subfamily of RGS proteins including RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Proteins in this family all possess a DEP (disheveled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin homology) and a GGL (G gamma subunit-like) domain (8Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S.

Recently, we identified 20 splice variant forms of RGS6 and demonstrated differences in their subcellular localization patterns that were related to structural differences in the proteins. 2T. K. Chatterjee, Z. Liu, and R. A. Fisher, manuscript submitted. 2T. K. Chatterjee, Z. Liu, and R. A. Fisher, manuscript submitted. We found that N-terminal sequences and the GGL domain function as cytoplasmic retention sequences and that splice variants lacking both of these domains localized exclusively in the nucleus. The structural complexity and diverse subcellular localization patterns of RGS6 proteins raises the possibility that RGS6 variants may have functions distinct from or in addition to effects on G protein signaling. RGS6 transcripts are expressed predominantly in brain although the functional role of these proteins remains unknown. To identify and isolate proteins that interact with RGS6, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen. We found that SCG10, a neuronal growth-associated protein, interacted strongly with RGS6. SCG10 belongs to the stathmin protein family, all members of which regulate cytoskeleton dynamics by destabilizing microtubules (11Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). SCG10 expression is high in the developing central nervous system and then dramatically decreases in adults (12Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K., Lo, L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both endogenous SCG10 in PC12 cells and ectopically expressed SCG10 are localized in the Golgi complex (13Di Paolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SCG10 in PC12 cells enhances neurite outgrowth (14Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B., Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), an indicator of neuronal differentiation. Here we show that the GGL domain of RGS6 is an SCG10-interacting region and the stathmin domain of SCG10 as the RGS6-interacting region. Co-expression of RGS6L with SCG10 resulted in their co-localization and promoted disruption of the microtubule network in COS-7 and PC12 cells. Both RGS6 and SCG10 enhance PC12 cell differentiation induced by NGF treatment and co-expression of SCG10 with RGS6 produced a synergistic effect on NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Effects of RGS6 on microtubules and neuronal differentiation were observed only with RGS6 proteins with complete GGL domains while an RGS6 protein mutant incapable of interacting with G proteins induced neuronal differentiation like wild type RGS6. This work defines a new role of the GGL domain of RGS proteins as a protein interaction domain for SCG10 and new evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation. Our results suggest that RGS6 induces neuronal differentiation by a novel mechanism involving interaction of SCG10 with its GGL domain and independent of RGS6 interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins. DISCUSSIONThe present study demonstrates specific interaction between RGS6 and SCG10 and further delineates the structural determinants for this interaction on both proteins. The GGL domain of RGS6 and the stathmin domain of SCG10 are the regions required for their high affinity interaction. RGS6 and SCG10 co-localized in cells expressing both proteins and their co-expression altered the patterns of subcellular localization observed when the proteins were expressed individually. This is the first evidence for RGS6 interaction with a protein other than a G protein α or β subunit. RGS6 co-expression with SCG10 produced a dramatic depletion of the microtubule network, perhaps in part due to its ability to promote delocalization of SCG10 from the Golgi complex. Both RGS6 and SCG10 enhanced PC12 cell differentiation induced by NGF treatment and were present in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells. Moreover, co-expression of SCG10 with RGS6L but not RGS6L(−GGL) produced a synergistic effect on NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Particularly noteworthy is our finding that the ability of RGS6 to promote neuronal differentiation is independent of interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins. This work defines a new role of the GGL domain of RGS proteins as a protein interaction domain for SCG10, the first evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation and the second example of G protein-independent actions of an RGS protein (7Chatterjee T.K. Fisher R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4334-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).RGS6 is a member of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins that also include RGS7, RGS9, and RGS11. Northern and in situ hybridization studies have shown a predominant expression of these proteins in brain, while RGS9 also is expressed in the retina (8Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F.

Res. 1998; 52: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). RGS9 is required for normal phototransduction processes in the retina (4Chen C.K. Burns M.E., He, W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), however the precise role of R7 subfamily members in brain has not been established. All members of this family possess a DEP domain and a GGL domain in addition to the semiconserved RGD. Although the role of the DEP domain is not known, the GGL domain has been shown to represent a binding site for an atypical Gβ subunit, Gβ5, whose expression is also limited to the brain (22Watson A.J. Katz A. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22150-22156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complexes of Gβ5 with RGS6, RGS7, and RGS9 have been isolated from brain or retina (23Zhang J.H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2503-2507Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) reported that Gβ5 interaction with RGS7 decreased the affinity of RGS7 to Gαo without affecting its GAP activity toward Gαo and that expression of RGS7 and Gβ5 in cells inhibited M3 muscarinic receptor-induced calcium mobilization mediated by Gαq (24Witherow D.S.

Complexes of RGS11·Gβ5 and RGS7·Gβ5 exhibit GAP activity toward the Gαo subunit in vitro (10Snow B.E. Betts L. Mangion J. Sondek J. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). A role for Gβ5 interaction with RGS9 in enhancing the GAP activity of cGMP phosphodiesterase toward transducin has been shown, although part of this effect is independent of the GGL domain of RGS9 (27He W., Lu, L. Zhang X., El- Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Gβ5 binding to RGS proteins may increase the stability of both proteins by post-transcriptional mechanisms (24Witherow D.S. Wang Q. Levay K. Cabrera J.L. Chen J. Willars G.B. Slepak V.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24872-24880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The GGL domain of RGS7 diverges from that of other RGS proteins in that it contains PEST sequences that target proteins for degradation (28Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Polycystin binds to the GGL domain of RGS7 and prevents RGS7 degradation (28Kim E. Arnould T. Sellin L. Benzing T. Comella N. Kocher O. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6371-6376Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), however no other RGS proteins have been shown to bind to polycystin. The physiological importance of polycystin·RGS7 interaction is unclear.Our findings show that SCG10 represents a GGL domain-binding partner for RGS6 and that this interaction has synergistic effects on NGF-induced differentiation of PC12 cells to neurons. This provides the first evidence for effects of an RGS protein on neuronal differentiation and for functional activities of RGS6 distinct from regulatory effects on G protein signaling. This latter conclusion is based upon our finding that RGS6L but not RGS6L(−GGL) enhanced SCG10-mediated microtubule destabilization and differentiation of PC12 cells, although both RGS6 splice forms possess the RGD needed for the GAP activity of these proteins toward Gα subunits (29Popov S., Yu, K. Kozasa T. Wilkie T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7216-7220Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that a mutation of a critical Asn in RGS6L required for RGS protein binding to and GAP activity toward Gα subunits, had no effects on its ability to promote neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. Posner et al. (26Posner B.A. Gilman A.G. Harris B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31087-31093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) showed that recombinant RGS6L exhibited GAP activity toward Gαo in vitro. Thus, it is possible that RGS6 may represent a multifunctional RGS protein capable of interactions with different proteins by different protein modules. Perhaps the particularly complex splicing of RGS6 transcripts serves to confer or limit protein interactions and signaling activities of members of the RGS6 protein family.While this work was in progress, Nixon et al. (30Nixon A.B. Grenningloh G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18127-18133Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) reported identification of SCG10 as a binding partner for RGSZ1 using the RGS domain of RGSZ1 as bait. Subsequent GST protein pull-down studies showed that the N terminus of RGSZ1 (1–86) and SCG10 (1–34) were required for their interaction. RGSZ1 does not possess a GGL domain, and its site of binding on SCG10 is outside of the stathmin domain and is unique to SCG10. Analysis of in vitro microtubule polymerization/depolymerization showed that binding of RGSZ1 to SCG10 blocked the ability of SCG10 to induce microtubule disassembly. These results are quite different from those obtained in terms of the structural features required for protein interactions between RGS6 and SCG10 and the effects of this interaction on microtubule dynamics, where we found that RGS6 produced a synergistic effect on SCG10 induced microtubule disruption using intact cells.The precise mechanism by which RGS6 enhances differentiation of PC12 cells cannot be determined from the present studies. SCG10 is a brain-specific member of the stathmin protein family, all members of which share a common stathmin domain possessing microtubule-depolymerizing activity (11Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present evidence for strong interactions of RGS6 with this domain raises the possibility that RGS6 may affect this stathmin domain function by direct interactions. Indeed, it is believed that SCG10 enhances neurite outgrowth by increasing the dynamic instability of microtubules in the growth cone (14Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B., Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How Golgi complex-associated SCG10 gets transported to the growth cone and exerts this activity remains an open question. Our finding that co-expression of RGS6 and SCG10 disrupted the subcellular localization of both proteins may be relevant to how these proteins produce synergistic effects on microtubule disruption and NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Certainly, the finding that both proteins are localized in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells is consistent with a role in neurite outgrowth. Our results do show that RGS6 induces neuronal differentiation by a novel mechanism involving interaction of SCG10 with its GGL domain and independent of RGS6 interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins.The present results raise intriguing questions concerning the physiological role of RGS6 in brain. Expression of SCG10 is developmentally regulated, with high levels of expression observed in embryonic and postnatal brain (12Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K., Lo, L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our finding that interaction of RGS6 and SCG10 is mediated via their GGL and stathmin domains, respectively, raises the possibility that RGS6 may interact with other members of the stathmin protein family and that other members of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins may have similar protein interactions and functional effects on neuronal differentiation. Further studies will be required to evaluate the protein: protein interactions, possible mutual regulation between these two protein families and the role of this interaction in neuronal differentiation and development. It is intriguing that RGS6 transcripts undergo complex alternative splicing to generate at least twenty splice forms of RGS62 with ten of these forms predicted to be incapable of interacting with SCG10 due to splicing within the GGL domain. Hopefully, the present work will facilitate studies to reveal the likely complex functional roles of the RGS6 protein family in brain. The present study demonstrates specific interaction between RGS6 and SCG10 and further delineates the structural determinants for this interaction on both proteins.

RGSZ1 does not possess a GGL domain, and its site of binding on SCG10 is outside of the stathmin domain and is unique to SCG10. Analysis of in vitro microtubule polymerization/depolymerization showed that binding of RGSZ1 to SCG10 blocked the ability of SCG10 to induce microtubule disassembly. These results are quite different from those obtained in terms of the structural features required for protein interactions between RGS6 and SCG10 and the effects of this interaction on microtubule dynamics, where we found that RGS6 produced a synergistic effect on SCG10 induced microtubule disruption using intact cells. The precise mechanism by which RGS6 enhances differentiation of PC12 cells cannot be determined from the present studies. SCG10 is a brain-specific member of the stathmin protein family, all members of which share a common stathmin domain possessing microtubule-depolymerizing activity (11Charbaut E. Curmi P.A. Ozon S. Lachkar S. Redeker V. Sobel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16146-16154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The present evidence for strong interactions of RGS6 with this domain raises the possibility that RGS6 may affect this stathmin domain function by direct interactions. Indeed, it is believed that SCG10 enhances neurite outgrowth by increasing the dynamic instability of microtubules in the growth cone (14Riederer B.M. Pellier V. Antonsson B., Di Paolo G. Stimpson S.A. Lutjens R. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). How Golgi complex-associated SCG10 gets transported to the growth cone and exerts this activity remains an open question. Our finding that co-expression of RGS6 and SCG10 disrupted the subcellular localization of both proteins may be relevant to how these proteins produce synergistic effects on microtubule disruption and NGF-induced PC12 cell differentiation. Certainly, the finding that both proteins are localized in neurites of differentiated PC12 cells is consistent with a role in neurite outgrowth. Our results do show that RGS6 induces neuronal differentiation by a novel mechanism involving interaction of SCG10 with its GGL domain and independent of RGS6 interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins. The present results raise intriguing questions concerning the physiological role of RGS6 in brain. Expression of SCG10 is developmentally regulated, with high levels of expression observed in embryonic and postnatal brain (12Stein R. Mori N. Matthews K., Lo, L.C. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 463-476Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Our finding that interaction of RGS6 and SCG10 is mediated via their GGL and stathmin domains, respectively, raises the possibility that RGS6 may interact with other members of the stathmin protein family and that other members of the R7 subfamily of RGS proteins may have similar protein interactions and functional effects on neuronal differentiation. Further studies will be required to evaluate the protein: protein interactions, possible mutual regulation between these two protein families and the role of this interaction in neuronal differentiation and development. It is intriguing that RGS6 transcripts undergo complex alternative splicing to generate at least twenty splice forms of RGS62 with ten of these forms predicted to be incapable of interacting with SCG10 due to splicing within the GGL domain. Hopefully, the present work will facilitate studies to reveal the likely complex functional roles of the RGS6 protein family in brain.

Jensen J.B. Sherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society of Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 11-22Google Scholar). As a consequence, only a limited number of potential drug targets have been identified in recent years. One reason for this is the obligatory intracellular life style of the parasite, which has complicated access to biochemical and physiological pathways. A powerful method to investigate physiological processes of intact cells, under non-disruptive conditions, is live cell fluorescence microscopy. This technique has recently been applied to the intraerythrocytic stages of P. falciparum for measuring intracellular pH, ion concentrations, Ca2+ signaling, and protein targeting (2Garcia C.R.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The main advantage of live cell fluorescence microscopy is that it allows for the spatial separation of signals originating from the parasite and from the surrounding infected erythrocyte. Even subcellular compartments, such as the parasite's acidic food vacuole, can be visualized in situ using this method (5Dzekunov S.M. Ursos L.M. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). However, a number of concerns have recently been raised about using single cell fluorescence microscopy in P. falciparum (8Ginsburg H. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 40-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). A major disadvantage is the variability between cells, requiring a relatively large number of determinations to obtain statistically significant measurements. Reproducibility between different laboratories seems to be low as well when data obtained from single cell measurements are compared. For example, although some studies have found differences in the parasite's cytosolic pH between chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum strains, other studies could not verify this observation (7Wunsch S.

Symp. 1999; 226: 265-277PubMed Google Scholar). Another example represents the use of acridine orange (AO)1 in the measurement of the parasite's food vacuolar pH (5Dzekunov S.M. Ursos L.M. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Ursos L.M. Dzekunov S.M. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem.

Parasitol. 2002; 119: 307-309Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Although AO is an acidotropic compound and expected to accumulate in the parasite's acidic food vacuole, subsequent studies have challenged this concept by presenting data that show exclusive staining of the parasite's cytosol with AO, while the parasite's food vacuole remained unstained (14Bray P.G. Saliba K.J. Davies J.D. Spiller D.G. White M.R. Kirk K. Ward S.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119 (discussion: 119, 307–309, 311–313): 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, the intracellular distribution of AO within the parasite is still uncertain. Where do these discrepancies come from? In the case of AO, interpretation of the data is complicated by the fact that AO has very different fluorescence properties depending on its concentration and its interaction with cellular macromolecules, e.g. DNA and RNA (16Clerc S. Barenholz Y. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 259: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 17Palmgren M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 18Millot C. Millot J.M. Morjani H. Desplaces A. Manfait M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When excited at 490 nm, monomeric AO emits green light of ∼530 nm. These spectral properties remain unchanged when AO binds to double-stranded DNA, thus staining nuclei green. At higher concentrations AO forms aggregates, causing a major shift in the emission spectrum toward red light of around 655 nm (18Millot C. Millot J.M. Morjani H. Desplaces A. Manfait M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). AO also shows red fluorescence when bound to single-stranded RNA. Because AO is a lipophilic weak base, it is readily membrane-permeable and can accumulate in acidic compartments, where the protonated molecule forms red fluorescing aggregates. Therefore, acidic compartments stain red with AO, a phenomenon often used to identify lysosomes or other acidic organelles (18Millot C. Millot J.M. Morjani H. Desplaces A. Manfait M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Due to the varying spectral properties of AO, the right choice of filters allowing the green from the red fluorescence to be separated is essential to quantify the emission signal and obtain accurate data on pH and subcellular localization. Furthermore, because aggregation is strongly dependent on a number of parameters, including pH gradients, AO concentration, temperature, and ionic composition of the compartment investigated (17Palmgren M.G. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), these also need to be considered when trying to quantify AO fluorescence. While misinterpretation of fluorescence signals may explain the controversy surrounding the subcellular localization of AO inP. falciparum, this cannot provide a satisfactory explanation for the difficulties one encounters when trying to reproduce published physiological baseline values obtained using other fluorescent dyes. In search for a rational explanation, we have investigated the response of P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes to light and found that even a short light exposure causes a selective leakage of the parasite's food vacuole. A model for the unexpected photosensitivity of the food vacuolar membrane is proposed. In vitro culture of theP. falciparum strain HB3 was performed as described previously (19Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes of mixed stages were washed twice with Ringer's solution and settled onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in a micro-perfusion chamber as previously described (7Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse-Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Wunsch S. Sanchez C. Gekle M. Kersting U. Fischer K. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1997; 99: 44-50Google Scholar). Unbound parasites were washed away by perfusion with Ringer's solution supplemented with the fluorescence dyes at the following concentrations: acridine orange, 1–5 μm; Lysosensor Blue DND 192, 1 μm; Hoechst 33342, 1 μm. In other experiments, infected erythrocytes were pre-loaded with the dye resuspended in Ringer's solution for 10 min at 37 °C. The following dye concentration were used: (5 and 6)-chloromethyl-2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H2DCFDA), 10 μm; 4,4-difluoro-5,7-dimethyl-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-hexadecanoic acid (BODIPY FL C16), 10 μm; (5 and 6)-carboxyl SNARF-1-AM (SNARF), 10 μm; 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-(5 and 6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF), 10 μm. The remaining dye was washed out by perfusion with Ringer's solution. Acridine orange was purchased from Sigma; all other dyes were obtained from Molecular Probes. The internal pH calibration of the SNARF fluorescence ratios was performed using the high K+/nigericin method as previously described (7Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse-Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Wunsch S. Sanchez C. Gekle M. Kersting U. Fischer K. Horrocks P. Lanzer M. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1997; 99: 44-50Google Scholar). Epifluorescence images of acridine orange fluorescence were obtained with an inverted Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope. Monochrome excitation light was generated by a xenon lamp coupled to a Polychrome II monochromator (Till Photonics, Germany) set to the wavelength indicated for the different experiments. Between exposures the wavelength was rapidly switched to 680 nm as a shutter wavelength. The excitation light was reflected onto the sample with a 510-nm dichroic mirror (Delta Lights and Optics, Denmark) and focused by a Zeiss Fluar 100/1.3 oil lens. The emitted light passing back through the dichroic mirror was filtered by a band pass filter D 630/60 (AHF Analysentechnik, Germany) and imaged using a cooled charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments). Data acquisition and analysis were performed using Metafluor (Universal Imaging Corp.). Confocal scanning fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM510 (Carl Zeiss, Germany) equipped with UV and visible laser lines. The laser lines and filter settings used were as indicated in the figure legends. For optimized pH measurements we used the following settings: 10 μm SNARF, loaded at 37 °C for 20 min; excitation of 543 nm with 3–5% transmission, 63-fold lens with a 5-fold zoom, 256 × 256 pixels with a 1.76-μs pixel time, and no pixel averaging. P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were purified using a strong magnet (VarioMACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) (21Staalsoe T. Giha H.A. Dodoo D. Theander T.G. Hviid L. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 329-336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), loaded with SNARF or BCECF at the concentration described above, washed, and resuspended in Ringer's solution at a concentration of 5000 infected erythrocytes per microliter. The cell resuspension was kept at 37 °C. 100-μl aliquots were placed on a ceramic plate and illuminated, at a constant distance of 7.5 cm, with a 20-watt halogen lamp for various lengths of time ranging from 5 to 1200 s. The irradiation was quantified using a photodiode connected to a calibrated quantum sensor (LI-250 Quantum Sensor, LI-COR Biosciences). On average the halogen lamp emitted an irradiation of 3800 μmol of photons per second and square meter. The changes in fluorescence intensities were measured using FACS analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur and converted into pH values as previously described (22Lang F. Madlung J. Bock J. Lukewille U. Kaltenbach S. Lang K.S. Belka C. Wagner C.A. Lang H.J. Gulbins E. Lepple-Wienhues A. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, SNARF emission fluorescence signals were measured at 585 nm in channel FL-2H and at 650 nm in channel FL-3H. To obtain actual cytoplasmic pH values, autofluorescence values were subtracted and the ratios of FL-2H/FL-3H were calculated. The ratios were then calibrated using a pH standard curve. For pH calibration, cells were resuspended in high K+/nigericin solutions with pH values of 6.55, 6.88, 7.0, 7.4, 7.8, 8.15, and 8.51. For BCECF, emission fluorescence was recorded in channel FL-1H. To evaluate a method recently introduced for measuring the pH of the acidic food vacuole in P. falciparum using AO (5Dzekunov S.M. Ursos L.M. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we initially characterized the subcellular distribution of AO fluorescence in livingP. falciparum-infected erythrocytes. We observed a complex fluorescence pattern (Fig. 1). The highest intensity from the red emission band (>650 nm) was observed in a defined area covering the dark hemozoin crystal. This staining pattern is consistent with AO being trapped in the acidic food vacuole upon protonation. The green emission band (505–550 nm) co-localized with the fluorescence of Hoechst 33342, a DNA marker, which indicates association of AO with nuclear DNA. We also observed a significant number of parasites with an inverted staining pattern for the red fluorescence band, i.e. instead of the vacuole, the cytoplasm was stained. In comparison, the green fluorescence pattern remained unchanged. Examinations of single cells revealed that the redistribution of the red AO fluorescence from a vacuolar to a cytoplasmic localization is a dynamic process that occurs during continuous illumination. Although initially the bright red AO fluorescence exclusively co-localized with the parasite's acidic food vacuole (Fig. 2 a), a redistribution toward the cytosol was observed after 400 s of illumination, corresponding to 80 exposures with 0.1% transmission of the 488 nm argon laser line (Fig. 2 b). Quantification of the fluorescence signals revealed that the decline in vacuolar red AO fluorescence is linear with time and occurred, after a lag phase of ∼150 s, concomitantly with an increase in the cytosolic red fluorescence (Fig. 2 c). The decline in fluorescence intensity was not due to bleaching of the dye, because the green fluorescence intensities showed a marked increase throughout the measurement. Inversion of the red AO fluorescence signal was independent of the light source used and was observed using a laser scanning microscope as well as a conventional epifluorescence microscope with a 75-watt xenon short-arc lamp for illumination, exciting at 480 nm with a 99.9% absorption pre-filter (Fig.2 d). Measurements were conducted at 25 °C in an open bath chamber or at 37 °C in a closed recording chamber continually perfused with RPMI medium, therefore ruling out the possibility that changes in temperature or different buffer composition caused inversion of the red AO fluorescence pattern. With both types of imaging, we did not observe the crescent shaped AO staining pattern previously described (5Dzekunov S.M. Ursos L.M. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 107-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), unless the dye was cytosolic (Fig. 2 b). Because the subcellular distribution of AO is pH-dependent, we investigated whether the inversion of the red AO fluorescence pattern was due to changes in vacuolar and cytosolic pH. We incubated P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes with the lysosomal marker Lysosensor Blue DND 192 and the ratiometric pH sensor SNARF. Like AO, Lysosensor Blue is a weak base that accumulates in acidic compartments but does not interact with DNA or RNA. The fluorescence signals emitted from Lysosensor Blue and SNARF were monitored using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Initially, Lysosensor Blue preferentially stained the food vacuole, whereas SNARF showed a strong staining throughout the parasite (Fig.3 a). In the case of Lysosensor Blue, the subcellular distribution changed upon prolonged illumination in a manner similar to that observed for AO, i.e. a drastic decrease in vacuolar staining and an increase in cytosolic staining (Fig. 3 b). The subcellular redistribution of the Lysosensor Blue fluorescence signal coincided with a marked decrease in the cytoplasmic pH of at least 0.45 pH unit, as observed by simultaneous pH measurements using the ratiometric dye SNARF (Fig.3 c). In all cases in which we observed light-induced cytoplasmic acidification, the observed pH reached the lower end of the SNARF calibration curve (pH < 7.0), suggesting that the actual pH might have dropped even further. This was confirmed using the fluorophore calcein, which is only fluorescent above pH values of 6.0 (23Lichtenfels R. Biddison W.E. Schulz H. Vogt A.B. Martin R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 227-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Upon illumination of the parasite, the calcein fluorescence vanished, suggesting a drop in cytosolic pH below 6.0 (data not shown). These light-induced changes in the parasite's cytoplasmic pH were observed independent of the pH indicator used. The pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF, which has been previously used to determine the parasite's cytoplasmic pH (6Hayashi M. Yamada H. Mitamura T. Horii T. Yamamoto A. Moriyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34353-34358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 7Wunsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Grosse-Wortmann L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J.

Mitt. 1997; 99: 44-50Google Scholar), also monitored changes within the parasite's cytosolic pH during illumination (Fig.4). Once the laser started scanning the parasite cytosol (Fig. 4 a, lines scanned from topto bottom), the pH-sensitive BCECF fluorescence decreased and fell off to about 15% of the original signal (Fig. 4 c). This effect was not due to bleaching, because the signal in the surrounding erythrocytes remained unchanged (Fig. 4 b). Rather, the pH appeared to drop within the entire cytosol as soon as part of the parasite was illuminated. Even a brief localized light pulse (10 ms, 488 nm, 100% transmission, circle of 13 pixel diameter) directed to a small region within the cytosol caused acidification (Fig. 5 a), from which the parasite recovered only slowly. A stable cytosolic pH could only be measured under optimized conditions with a minimal amount of illumination (Fig. 5 b) (543-nm excitation, low transmission, few scan points per cell, minimal pixel time, no pixel averaging).Figure 5Stable pH with low light levels. a, time course of parasite cytosolic pH upon brief illumination. Infected erythrocytes were loaded with 5 μmcarboxyl SNARF, and the pH was calculated from fluorescence intensity ratios (5-s intervals) after an internal calibration. At the time point indicated, a small area (13 × 13 pixels) of the cytosol was scanned for 10 ms with the 488-nm laser line at 100% transmission. For confocal imaging, the cells were excited with 543 nm (7%), and emission was recorded from 560 to 610 nm and above 650 nm. This recording is representative of three similar measurements.b, optimized conditions allow stable pH recordings. Infected erythrocytes were loaded with 10 μm carboxyl SNARF for 1 h and excited with 543 nm (5% transmission) at 5-s intervals with 1.76 μs per pixel, 256 × 256 pixel resolution, and no averaging. This recording is representative of eight similar measurements.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next set out to determine the effect of exposure time and wavelength on the light-induced cytoplasmic acidification in P. falciparum, using the intracellular redistribution of AO as a marker. Cells were loaded with AO and exposed to different light pulses ranging from 20 ms to 1000 ms, while keeping the wavelength of the pulse constant at 480 nm and the transmission at 0.1% (Fig. 6 a). We observed a reverse correlation between the length of the light pulse and the ratio of the red AO fluorescence determined in the vacuole versusthat of the cytoplasm. Thus, the longer the light pulse, the faster the subcellular redistribution of AO occurred. It was noticeable that even minimal exposure times of 20 ms led to an inversion of the AO staining with a half-life time of about 200 s (Fig. 6 b). To quantify the dose of irradiation required to induce changes in cytoplasmic pH, infected erythrocytes were loaded with SNARF and exposed at a constant distance to the beam of a 20-watt halogen lamp for various lengths of time ranging from 5 to 1200 s. The irradiation emitted during each exposure was quantified using a photodiode connected to a calibrated quantum sensor. Changes in cytosolic pH were then ratiometrically determined using a FACSCalibur (22Lang F. Madlung J. Bock J. Lukewille U. Kaltenbach S. Lang K.S. Belka C. Wagner C.A. Lang H.J. Gulbins E. Lepple-Wienhues A. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 902-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A sharp decrease in cytoplasmic pH of at least 0.4 pH unit, from a resting pH of 7.3 ± 0.05 (n = 6) to below 6.9, was observed upon illumination. A graphic analysis of the cytosolic pH as a function of irradiation revealed a sigmoidal dose-response curve, with a half-maximal drop in cytoplasmic pH at 1700 ± 400 mmol of photons/m2 (Fig.7 a). However, the first effects on cytoplasmic pH were already observed with an irradiation of 120 mmol of photons/m2. A similar sigmoidal relationship between irradiation and changes in cytoplasmic pH was also obtained using BCECF as the pH indicator (Fig. 7 b). Given that BCECF requires excitation at 460 and 488 nm for ratiometric determinations, conditions that the FACSCalibur used in this study does not support, the BCECF emission fluorescence signal recorded in the FL-1H channel of the FACSCalibur could not be converted into pH values. Despite these limitations, the changes in BCECF fluorescence observed upon irradiation with light provides a qualitative measure for changes in cytoplasmic pH. Analysis of the forward and side scattering revealed no changes in the cell volume of infected erythrocytes (data not shown), indicating that the integrity of the erythrocyte remained intact during the entire procedure. To determine the wavelength dependence of the light-induced changes inP. falciparum, we loaded infected erythrocytes with AO and exposed these to two different wavelengths: one of 480 nm to measure AO fluorescence (50 ms), and a second variable wavelength of either 350, 400, or 450 nm, respectively, for 200 ms (Fig. 6 c). Changes in AO fluorescence were monitored by confocal laser scanning microscopy. The transmission efficiencies of the optics at the different wavelengths were comparable (±10%), as determined using a photodiode in the sample holder. We observed the slowest response in terms of AO redistribution at 350 nm with a time of half-maximal change of 140 s, whereas at both 400 and 450 nm the halftimes were about 30% shorter. This implies that the inversion of the AO staining is more sensitive to visible light than to UV light. To test whether the light-induced pH changes and the subsequent dye redistribution might be caused by lysis of the parasite acidic food vacuole, we examined the autofluorescence from this compartment under continued light exposure. Illuminated at 488 nm (30% transmission), the food vacuole emits a weak autofluorescence together with some reflection from the hemozoin crystal (Fig.8 a). This autofluorescence filled out the entire vacuole and co-localized with the vacuolar dye Lysosensor Blue DND 192 (Fig. 8 a). Under these conditions, no autofluorescence was observed from the parasite cytoplasm. However, upon repeated illumination, the Lysosensor Blue started to redistribute and, concomitantly, the autofluorescence spread from the vacuole until it filled the entire cytosol (Fig. 8 b). A similar change in the autofluorescence pattern could also be observed in the absence of Lysosensor Blue under otherwise identical conditions, ruling out a bleed-through between recording channels used to monitor the different fluorescence signals emitted (data not shown). These data suggest that the parasite's acidic food vacuolar membrane looses its integrity during repeated illumination. It has been shown in other systems that membrane damage can result from peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (24Paillous N. Fery-Forgues S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Mylonas C. Kouretas D. In Vivo. 1999; 13: 295-309PubMed Google Scholar). A highly effective substance to initiate lipid peroxidation, a self-perpetuating chain reaction, is the hydroxyl radical (24Paillous N. Fery-Forgues S. Biochimie (Paris). 1994; 76: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 25Mylonas C. Kouretas D. In Vivo. 1999; 13: 295-309PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether light generates hydroxyl radicals in P. falciparum we took advantage of a substance, called CM-H2DCFDA, which emits fluorescence when associated with a hydroxyl radical (26Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Thus, the fluorescence intensity emitted by CM-H2DCFDA directly correlates with the amount of hydroxyl radicals generated in the cell (26Liu S.X. Athar M. Lippai I. Waldren C. Hei T.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1643-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes were loaded with CM-H2DCFDA and exposed to different intensities of the 488-nm argon laser line. Changes in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence were recorded over time using a confocal laser scanning microscope (Fig. 9). At 0.1% light transmission, CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence increased only slightly during the recording time of 300 s. At higher transmission intensities, however, a marked increase in CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence occurred, indicating an increased generation of hydroxyl radicals in the parasite's cytoplasm (Fig. 9 a). The kinetics of CM-H2DCFDA fluorescence, and hence of hydroxyl radical generation, directly correlated with light intensity (Fig.9 b). With more light, more hydroxyl radicals were produced. The decline in fluorescence observed for 5 and 2% light transmission, once maximal fluorescence values were reached,"

Elevation of quinolinate levels in the brain has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative disorders, the so-called “quinolinate hypothesis.” Quinolinate is non-enzymatically derived from α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde (ACMS). α-Amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) is the only known enzyme that can process ACMS to a benign catabolite and thus prevent the accumulation of quinolinate from ACMS. ACMSD seems to be regulated by nutritional and hormonal signals, but its molecular mechanism has, to date, been largely unknown. Utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified porcine kidney ACMSD, a cDNA encoding human ACMSD was cloned and characterized. The cDNA encodes a unique open reading frame of 336 amino acids and displays little homology to any known enzymes or motifs in mammalian databases, suggesting that ACMSD may contain a new kind of protein fold. Real-time PCR-based quantification of ACMSD revealed very low but significant levels of the expression in the brain. Brain ACMSD messages were down- and up-regulated in response to low protein diet and streptozocin-induced diabetes, respectively. The enzyme activities measured from partially purified brains were closely correlated with the changes in the message levels. Expression of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT), another enzyme that catabolizes quinolinate, was also found in the brain. This suggests that a pathway does exist by which the levels of quinolinate in the brain are regulated. In this report, we address the molecular basis underlying quinolinate metabolism and the regulation of ACMSD expression.

Quinolinate (quinolinic acid) is an intermediate in the de novo synthesis of NAD from tryptophan and acts as a potent endogenous neurotoxin through hyperstimulation of theN-methyl d-aspartate (NMDA) 1The abbreviations used are: NMDA, N-methyl d-aspartate; ACMS, α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde; 3HA, hydroxyanthranilic acid; AMS, α-aminomuconate-ε-semialdehyde; ACMSD, α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; QPRT, quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase; SH, Src homology. receptor (1Stone T.W.

When quinolinate is loaded into rat brains by autodialysis, the striatal region is specifically severely damaged (4Schwarcz R. Whetsell W.O. Mangano R.M.

An autoradioreceptor assay showed that the number of NMDA glutamate receptors in patients of Huntington's disease was reduced by 93% (7Young A.B. Greenamyre J.T. Hollingsworth Z. Albin R. D'Amato C. Shoulson I. Penny J.B. Science. 1988; 241: 981-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), supporting a hypothesis that an endogenous agonist of the receptor is primarily responsible for the neural degradation associated with the disease. Unlike kainate or ibotenate, quinolinate is thought to be the only physiological agonist for the NMDA receptors involved in the disorder (1Stone T.W. Perkins M.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 72: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar, 2Perkins M.N. Stone T.W. Brain Res. 1982; 247: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar, 3Perkins M.N. Stone T.W. Brain Res. 1983; 259: 172-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus, a dysfunction of quinolinate metabolism in the human brain has been postulated to be involved in the pathogenesis of such neurodegenerative disorders as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease (“quinolinate hypothesis”) (8Schwarcz R. Speciale C. Okuno E. French E.D. Kohler C. Schwarcz R. Ari Y. Excitatory Amino Acids and Epilepsy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 697-707Google Scholar, 9Schwarcz R. Okuno E. Speciale C. Kohler C. Whetsell Jr., W.O. Jenner P. Neurotoxins and Their Pharmacological Implications. Raven Press, New York1987: 19-32Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, quinolinate is non-enzymatically derived from α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde (ACMS). ACMS is generated from 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3HA) by the catalysis of 3HA oxygenase. 3HA oxygenase activity in the brains of Huntington's disease patients was found to be 3.5-fold higher than in normal controls (10Schwarcz R. Okuno E. White R.J. Bird E.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4079-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), suggesting an association between elevated levels of quinolinate and the disease. ACMS can be diverted to a benign catabolite, α-aminomuconate-ε-semialdehyde (AMS), by α-amino-β-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) (E. C. 4.1.1.45). Therefore, in terms of the quinolinate hypothesis, ACMSD may play an important role in prevention of progression to disease. Because the conversion rate of tryptophan to quinolinate (and then to NAD) and ACMSD activity are quite inversely correlated, conditions that reduce ACMSD expression may increase the risk of quinolinate toxicity. ACMSD has been shown to be down-regulated by low protein and low polyunsaturated fatty-acid diets (11Shibata K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 467: 711-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), clofibrate (a peroxisome proliferate activator) (12Shibata K. Kondo T. Marugami M. Umezawa C. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1996; 60: 1444-1449Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar), tyroxine (13Shibata K. Vitamins (Japan). 1998; 72: 85-96Google Scholar), pyrazinamide, and pyrazinoic acid (14Nasu S. Yamaguchi K. Sakakibara S. Imai H. Ueda I. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 677: 109-119Google Scholar). On the other hand, ACMSD is up-regulated by adrenaline, glucocorticoid, female hormones, (13Shibata K. Vitamins (Japan). 1998; 72: 85-96Google Scholar) and in diabetes (15Sanada H. Miyazaki M. Takahashi T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1980; 26: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study, as a first step toward elucidating the molecular basis underlying quinolinate metabolism and regulation of ACMSD expression, a cDNA encoding human ACMSD was cloned utilizing partial amino acid sequences obtained from highly purified ACMSD. Functional expression of the cDNA in mammalian cells proved that the cDNA encodes ACMSD. DNA modification enzymes and restriction enzymes were purchased from standard commercial sources and used according to the manufacturers' instructions. PCR was performed as described (16Fukuoka S. Scheele G.A. Pancreas. 1990; 5: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) except that Taq polymerase was used with Pfu polymerase (1:1 unit ratio) to increase the fidelity of template amplification. The recombinant plasmids constructed as described below were confirmed by a combination of restriction enzyme mapping and DNA sequencing. The oligonucleotides used are listed below. The enzyme was purified as described previously (17Egashira Y. Kouhashi H. Ohta T. Sanada H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1996; 42: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Homogeneity of the sample was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and N-terminal amino acid sequencing. About 50 pmol of purified porcine kidney ACMSDase spotted on polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was subjected to direct N-terminal sequencing with a HP G1005A protein sequencing system (Hitachi). A separate portion of the purified enzyme was carboxymethylated and then cleaved by achromobacter protease I. Peptide fragments were separated by a reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. Internal amino acids of the enzyme were obtained by sequencing the resulting peptides as described previously (18Aebersold R.H. Leavitt J. Saavedra P.A. Hood L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6970-6974Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The full-length human ACMSD cDNA was obtained from a λ UniZAP II human brain cDNA library (19Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) using radiolabeled oligonucleotides 5′-TGAAAATTGACATCCATAGTCATATTCTACAA-3′ and 5′-TACTGGCTCCCTTGGCTTGTAGGAATGCCAG-3′. DNA sequencing was performed with dye terminators using a Prism sequencing reaction kit and a DNA sequencer 477A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) on both strands of a set of overlapped cDNA clones generated with a nested deletion by exonucleases III and VII. The human ACMSD cDNA was then used as a probe to screen isologues in rat and mouse liver cDNA libraries constructed in λ UniZAP II (Stratagene). Homology search FASTA and BLAST (20Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar) software were utilized to search similar sequences in a non-redundant nucleotide or amino acid data base in the Genome Net WWW server. The TIGR data base was also utilized. Domain/motif searching was performed using PROSITE and MOTIDIC software. PSORT was used to search sorting signals. An EcoRI-NotI fragment carrying the complete open reading frame from the cDNA cloning vector were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pZeoSV2(+) (Stratagene). The expression construct was then transfected into COS7 cells with Lipofectin (Invitrogen). Transient expression of ACMSD was assayed 72 h after transfection. Cells were harvested and lysed with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 137 mm sodium chloride, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 100 μm leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml FOY-305. The lysed homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 ×g for 15 min to sediment insoluble materials. Supernatants were used for enzyme assays. The ACMSD activity was measured by a previously described method (21Ichiyama A. Nakayama S. Kawai H. Honjo T. Nishizuka Y. Hayaishi O. Senoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 740-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Host COS7 cells and transfectants with the self-ligated vector were subjected to the same examinations as controls. Quantitation of ACMSD expression in mouse kidney, liver, and brain was performed by an iCycler PCR (BioRad), a real-time PCR machine, using SYBR Green dye for target DNA quantitation. Rat total kidney, liver, and whole brain RNAs were prepared using the RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-specific primers (PE Applied Biosystems) were used as an internal control during quantitation. The ACMSD-specific primers used were 5′-AGGCTGGGTGCAGCTCCAAAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCCCAGGGATGCACGAACAG-3′ (reverse). Expression of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) was quantitated by the same method. The QPRT-specific primers used were 5′-CACGTGGCAGGCACGAGGAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GAGGGAGAAATCAAGGGCTGG-3′ (reverse) per a previous report (19Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Male 8-week-old ICR mice were fed a low protein diet (5% casein, 84% sucrose, 5% corn oil, 5% mineral mixture, 1% vitamin mixture) or a normal protein diet (20% casein, 69% sucrose, 5% corn oil, 5% mineral mixture, 1% vitamin mixture) as described by Shibata and Matsuo (22Shibata K. Matsuo H. J. Nutr. 1989; 119: 896-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) for 10 days and sacrificed, whereupon various tissues were subjected to ACMSD and QPRT expression quantitation. In a separate study, mice fed with the normal diets were induced to be diabetic by intraperitoneal injection of 70 mg/kg streptozocin. After 72 h, the mice brains were assayed by real-time PCR for ACMSD and QPRT expression levels. The QPRT activity was measured independently by a previously described method (19Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Brains were pooled from each experimental group and processed as described below for measurements of the enzyme activities. A pool of 10 mice brains from each experimental group were homogenized with 5 volumes of ice-cold 50 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.14 mpotassium chloride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. A solution of protamine sulfate (0.4%, w/v) was added to the supernatant, and the sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The fraction precipitated between 50 and 60% of its saturation was collected and resuspended in a small amount of the buffer described above. The solution was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate solution, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m potassium chloride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then further concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM-10 membrane (Amicon, Inc., Beverly, MA) at 4 °C. Using the sample, brain ACMSD activity was measured as described (21Ichiyama A. Nakayama S. Kawai H. Honjo T. Nishizuka Y. Hayaishi O. Senoh S. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 740-749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For brain QPRT activity detection, a portion of the homogenate was heated at 65 °C for 2 min. The sample was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation. The fraction precipitated by 40% of its saturation was collected and resuspended in a small amount of the buffer described above. The solution was dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate solution, pH 7.0, containing 0.2m potassium chloride, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then further concentrated by ultrafiltration using a PM-10 membrane at 4 °C. Using the sample, brain QPRT activity was measured as described (19Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Four enzyme assays were performed using 4 pools of 10 mice brains for each experimental condition. Direct N-terminal sequencing of 50 pmol of highly purified porcine kidney ACMSD yielded a sequence of up to 51 amino acids starting with intact methionine (uncertain readings inparentheses): 1MKIDIHSHILPKEWPDLKKRFG (Y/G)XGWVELQHHSEG(E)AKML(K)D(G/D)(K)VFR(V/R)VQE51. The yields of the first five amino acid cleavages were m (26.3 pmol): Lys (23.4), Ile (18.9), Asp (28.0), and Ile (17.1), and the backgrounds of other amino acids were less than 2 pmol in each cycle. The presence of a single N terminus indicated high purity of the protein. Internal amino acid sequences were also obtained from peptides liberated from the purified enzyme by limited proteolysis: RFVGLGTLPMQAP, XSLFVHPWDMQ, YWFPWLIGMPAETTTAX(E)(S)MMMGGVFEK, VXFAHGGGSFPFTVGRI, and VILGTDYPFPLGELEPGK. Based on the assumption that the apparent 40-kDa molecular mass of ACMSD would translate to roughly 300–330 amino acids, ∼40% of the primary structure was most likely obtained by amino acid sequencing, indicating that the preparation was highly purified. Utilizing this information and frequent human codon usage (23Ikemura T. Wada K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4333-4339Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) to design oligonucleotide probes, a full-length ACMSD cDNA was cloned from a human brain cDNA library. The cDNA clone encodes 1237 nucleotides (nt) with a single open reading frame of 1008 nt (336 amino acids); a 57-nt 5′-noncoding sequence and a 172-nt 3′-noncoding sequence (Fig. 2). The presence of the presumed initiator ATG codon at base 58 was confirmed in the eukaryotic consensus sequence and is the first in-frame methionine in the 5′-untranslated region. The resulting coding region is assumed to be of full-length because the molecular mass (38033.36) deduced from the open reading frame is consistent with the molecular mass data observed from purified mammalian ACMSD (40 kDa). A typical polyadenylation signal (AATAAA) can be seen in the 3′-untranslated region starting at position 1208, indicating that nearly the entire 3′-noncoding sequence is present. The deduced human amino acid sequence contains regions closely related to those obtained from the purified porcine enzyme: MKIDIHSHILPKEWPDLKKRFGYGGWVQLQHHSKGEAKLLKDGKVFRVVRE (1–51), RFVGLGTLPMQAP (110–122), CSLFVHPWDMQ (169–179), YWLPWLVGMPAETTIAICSMIMGGVFEK (187–214), VCFAHGGGAFPFTVGRI (220–236), and VILGTDYPFPLGELEPGK (286–303). Over these 137 amino acids, the human and porcine enzymes share 98% identity. Searches of known functional domains and motifs for coenzyme binding using PROSITE and MOTIDIC software did not return any significant matches. Using PSORT, a piece of software that analyzes sorting signals in protein sequences, it was predicted that human ACMSD is a cytosolic protein. Using FASTA and BLAST, both homology search algorithms, no homologous protein-coding sequences were found in mammalian genomic databases, indicating that this is the first reporting of ACMSD and related enzymes. Some expressed sequence tags, however, which are partial sequences from randomly selected human and mouse cDNAs (from major tissues and organs), showed similarities, suggesting that the cloned sequence is an active gene in cognate organs. When the similarity search was performed for Caenorhabditis elegans,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Escherichia coli (1Stone T.W. Perkins M.N. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1981; 72: 411-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), and other prokaryotes whose genomic sequencing has been completed, only gene Y71011A3 of C. elegans was found to possess a relatively high degree of similarity. Potentially this is an isologue of ACMSD in C. elegans. This is consistent with the observation that ACMSD activity was not detected in microbes (24Nishizuka Y. Ichiyama A. Hayaishi O. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 471-476Google Scholar) and may suggest that ACMSD evolved only in multicellular organisms. Using human ACMSD cDNA as a probe, library screening in cognate species led to the discovery of rat and mouse isologues of ACMSD. Sequence comparisons are shown in Fig. 3. The similarity between human ACMSD and the rat, mouse, and C. elegans isologues are 85, 85, and 48% at the amino acid level, respectively. Endogenous ACMSD activity in mock (untransfected) or control (vector alone) COS7 cells was undetectable. As shown in TableI, transiently transfected COS 7 cells with human ACMSD cDNA showed 24 nmol AMS/hr/mg of protein at 72 h. When it is assumed that transient transfection occurred at 10% of cell population, the specific activity (240 nmol/hr/mg of protein) is comparable with those in mouse crude homogenates of liver, kidney, and porcine crude kidney (TableII and Ref. 17Egashira Y. Kouhashi H. Ohta T. Sanada H. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1996; 42: 173-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). This result confirmed the identity of the cloned cDNA as ACMSD.Table ITransient expression of human brain ACMSD cDNA (pACMSD) in COS cellsACMSD activity(nmol AMS/hr/mg of protein)pACMSD in COS7 cells24Control in COS7 cells< 0.1ACMSD activity is shown as the amount of enzyme that generates a given nmol of α-aminomuconate-ɛ-semialdehyde (AMS), a reaction product per mg of protein.

As shown in Table II, quantitation of ACMSD expression in rat kidney, liver, and brain was performed by real-time PCR. ACMSD was found to be expressed in the brain, although at 370- and 15-fold lower amounts than in the kidney and liver, respectively. The relative expression of QPRT was found to be 1000:3261:23 in kidney, liver, and brain, respectively. Brain ACMSD expression was shown to be nutrition-sensitive (TableIII). When the mice were fed 5% casein diets, ACMSD expression was down-regulated by one-third compared with those fed 20% casein diets. When diabetes was induced in the mice by streptozocin injection, ACMSD expression was up-regulated by 80%. On the other hand, brain QPRT expression remained unchanged.Table IIIEffects of nutritional conditions on the expression of QPRT and ACMSD in the mouse brainQPRTACMSDmRNAEnzyme activitymRNAEnzyme activityunitpmol/hr/mgunitnmol/hr/mgcontrol (20% casein diet)100 ± 1755 ± 6100 ± 127.1 ± 1.1low protein (5% casein diet)107 ± 1551 ± 866 ± 7aStatistically significant (p < 0.001) when compared between the control and the test groups calculated using Student's t-test.3.0 ± 0.6aStatistically significant (p < 0.001) when compared between the control and the test groups calculated using Student's t-test.Streptozocin-induced diabetes97 ± 1561 ± 9180 ± 25aStatistically significant (p < 0.001) when compared between the control and the test groups calculated using Student's t-test.16.5 ± 2.4aStatistically significant (p < 0.001) when compared between the control and the test groups calculated using Student's t-test.Depicted in the chart are mRNA expression values relative to GAPDH (internal standard) when those in control studies are expressed as 100.

To confirm whether the changes in brain ACMSD at the message levels reflect those in the protein levels, we have developed a micro enzyme assay for partially purified samples from a pool of 10 mice brains. ACMSD activity was found to be specifically concentrated into a fraction precipitated between 50 and 60% of ammonium sulfate. After the dialysis and ultrafiltration, brain ACMSD was concentrated about 50-fold at the activity/volume and purified about 10-fold at the specific activity. The yields of the activities were confirmed to be reproducible at about 55 ± 5% (means ± standard deviations) in four experiments using the known amount of purified kidney ACMSD samples and the liver or kidney tissues. Brain ACMSD activities shown in Tables II and III were calculated and normalized with this value of the yield. Statistical analysis was done for values obtained from four enzyme assays using four pools of 10 mice brains for each experimental condition. Relationship between ACMSD message levels measured by the real-time PCR technique and the enzyme activities in the liver, kidney, and brain samples were highly correlated as shown in Fig. 4. The correlation coefficient value was 0.84. Brain QPRT activity was also measured using similarly purified mice brains. QPRT activity was found to be specifically concentrated into a fraction after heat treatment and precipitation by 40% of ammonium sulfate. Brain QPRT was concentrated about 60-fold at the activity/volume and purified about 20-fold at the specific activity. The yields of the activities were confirmed to be reproducible at about 260 ± 18% (means ± standard deviations) in four experiments using the known amount of purified kidney QPRT samples and the liver or kidney tissues. The apparent increase in the yield was reported previously and suggested that the purification removed inhibitory substances in the homogenates (19Fukuoka S. Nyaruhucha C.M. Shibata K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1395: 192-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Brain QPRT activities shown in Tables II and III were calculated and normalized with this value of the yield. Statistical analysis was done for values obtained from four enzyme assays using four pools of 10 mice brains for each experimental condition. The changes of brain ACMSD in different nutritional conditions and diabetes measured at the enzyme activity levels were clearly correlated to the changes measured at the message levels by the real-time PCR technique. The changes of brain QPRT measured at the enzyme activity levels remained unchanged in the different conditions, indicating that the correlation between protein and message levels existed. This report describes the cloning of human ACMSD and helps to characterize its structure and functional expression. The identification of this enzyme was achieved by a) purification and determination of partial amino acid sequences, b) cloning and structural characterization of cDNAs encoding human, rat, mouse, and C. elegans ACMSD, and c) functional expression of human ACMSD in COS 7 cells and measurement of enzymatic activity. ACMSD is a unique enzyme that reacts with ACMS, the primary oxidation product of 3-hydroxyanthranilate, to produce AMS with the simultaneous formation of CO2. Without the enzyme, ACMS is unstable and rapidly cyclizes spontaneously to produce quinolinate, a potent excitotoxin, which is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease (the quinolinate hypothesis) (8Schwarcz R. Speciale C. Okuno E. French E.D. Kohler C. Schwarcz R. Ari Y. Excitatory Amino Acids and Epilepsy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1986: 697-707Google Scholar, 9Schwarcz R. Okuno E. Speciale C. Kohler C. Whetsell Jr., W.O. Jenner P. Neurotoxins and Their Pharmacological Implications. Raven Press, New York1987: 19-32Google Scholar). Although genes responsible for Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases have been identified, the mechanism by which malfunction of these genes causes neural death is still largely unknown. Because quinolinate is the only known physiological excitotoxin, which acts via NMDA receptors, the quinolinate hypothesis should be tested in the molecular context. This paper provides information toward this end. The primary structure of ACMSD does not share any particular homology to known enzymes or proteins in databases, suggesting that ACMSD represents a novel type of protein structure-fold. No typical consensus sequences for nucleotide, metal, or any other cofactor binding sites were detected with motif search programs. This is consistent with the finding that ACMSD is not affected by metal-chelating agents. ACMSD activity has been shown to be inhibited by various SH inhibitors.p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibited its activity nearly 100% at a concentration of 0.1 mm. This inhibition is prevented by either reduced glutathione or cysteine. Alignment of the mammalian and C. elegans ACMSD sequences indicated that Cys (2Perkins M.N. Stone T.W. Brain Res. 1982; 247: 184-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar), all in close proximity, are conserved in four species beyond the phylogenic boundary (Fig. 3, boxed), suggesting that these Cys residues may be involved in the reaction center of ACMSD. Utilizing homologous regions shared by human, rat, and mouse ACMSD sequences, we were able to design a common set of primers by which the expression of ACMSD mRNA could be quantitated by real-time PCR. Using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as an internal standard, the ratio of ACMSD expression in mouse kidney, liver, and brain was found to be 370:15:1. The expression of brain ACMSD was found to be nutritional condition-sensitive: a low protein diet decreased and a streptozocin-induced diabetes increased the expression levels. The mode of action was similar to those in kidney and liver (11Shibata K. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 467: 711-716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Sanada H. Miyazaki M. Takahashi T. J. Nutr. Sci. Vitaminol. (Tokyo). 1980; 26: 449-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Quinolinate synthesized in peripheral tissues, however, could not pass through the blood brain barrier (25Foster A.C. Miller L.P. Oldendorf W.H. Schwarcz R. Exp. Neurol. 1984; 84: 428-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), proving that the metabolism of quinolinate and its regulation is brain-specific. Because the changes in ACMSD expression at the message levels are shown to be highly correlated to those at the enzyme activity levels, it is suggested that the quantification of the message levels with the real-time PCR technique is useful to address the regulation of ACMSD expression and quinolinate levels. In conclusion, this study provides a molecular definition of mammalian ACMSD and essential information for future studies designed to reveal the physiological function of the enzyme both in the central nervous system and in peripheral tissues."

During nitrogen starvation or growth in medium containing a poor nitrogen source, Gln3 is nuclear and NCR-sensitive transcription is high. However, when cells are grown in excess nitrogen, Gln3 is localized to the cytoplasm with a concomitant decrease in gene expression. Treating cells with the Tor protein inhibitor, rapamycin, mimics nitrogen starvation. Recently, carbon starvation has been reported to cause nuclear localization of Gln3 and increased NCR-sensitive transcription. Here we show that nuclear localization of Gln3 during carbon starvation derives from its indirect effects on nitrogen metabolism, i.e. Gln3 does not move into the nucleus of carbon-starved cells if glutamine rather than ammonia is provided as the nitrogen source. In addition, these studies have clearly shown Gln3 is not uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm, but rather localizes to punctate or tubular structures. Analysis of these images by deconvolution microscopy suggests that Gln3 is concentrated in or associated with a highly structured system in the cytosol, one that is possibly vesicular in nature. This finding may impact significantly on how we view (i) the mechanism by which Tor regulates the intracellular localization of Gln3 and (ii) how proteins move into and out of the nucleus.

Few such proteins have generated greater excitement than Tor1/2 and their mammalian counterpart mTor, which are inhibited by the immunosuppressant and antineoplastic drug rapamycin (1Barbet N.C.

In this work, we focus on the last two of these processes. NCR is the physiological process by which S. cerevisiaeselectively uses good nitrogen sources in its environment in preference to poor ones (5Cooper T.G. FEMS Microbiol.

In the presence of good nitrogen sources (glutamine, asparagine, and in some strains, ammonia), expression of genes encoding the permeases and enzymes needed for utilization of poor nitrogen sources is held at low levels, i.e. expression is repressed. When only poor (proline) or limiting amounts of good nitrogen sources are available, these genes are then expressed at the higher levels needed to scavenge whatever is available in the environment (5Cooper T.G.

Two GATA family transcriptional activators (Gln3 and Gat1/Nil1) are responsible for NCR-sensitive transcription and Ure2 (a yeast prion precursor) inhibits their ability to carry out this function (5Cooper T.G.

In glucose-proline medium, Gln3 and Gat1 are bound to the GATA sequences of the NCR-sensitive CAN1 gene, whereas in glucose-glutamine medium or in agln3Δgat1Δ strain, these GATAs are unoccupied and available to serve as surrogate TATA elements (13Cox K.H.

Like Gln3 and Gat1, nuclear localization of Rtg1/3 occurs when cells are treated with rapamycin (9Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 863-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), which also results in changes in Rtg3 phosphorylation levels (9Komeili A. Wedaman K.P. O'Shea E.K. Powers T. J.

Although consensus remains to be established on whether nuclear localization of Rtg3 occurs with the hyperphosphorylated form, hypophosphorylated form, or both, correlations between differences in transcription factor phosphorylation and retrograde gene expression are convincing (9Komeili A.

The retrograde gene expression experiments just described collectively demonstrate a relationship between nitrogen and carbon metabolism inS. cerevisiae. Bertram et al. (31Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) have recently reported a second major bridge linking carbon and nitrogen metabolism. They reported that starving cells for carbon, like starving them for nitrogen, results in Gln3 being localized to the nucleus and mediating transcription of the NCR-sensitive genes, GAP1,GDH2, and PUT1 (31Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Carbon-starved nuclear localization of Gln3 also correlates with its hyperphosphorylation. Finally, Snf1 has been shown to be required for these carbon starvation-induced changes in Gln3 localization, in phosphorylation, and for the transcription it mediates (31Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our interest was piqued by these carbon starvation experiments, because here Gln3 is nuclear during the nitrogen excess, which exists during carbon starvation. Investigating this phenomenon, we find that whether or not Gln3 is localized to the nucleus during carbon starvation is dictated by the nature of the nitrogen source, i.e. Gln3 nuclear localization occurs with ammonia but not glutamine as nitrogen source. The effects of carbon starvation with ammonia as the nitrogen source are indirect and most likely caused by the inability of ammonia to be assimilated into glutamate during carbon starvation due to the lack of α-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton of glutamate. More important, however, we also found that Gln3 is not uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm during growth in glutamine medium. It appears to be sequestered in or associated with globular/tubular structures. The implications of this distribution generate an alternative way of viewing how Tor influences Gln3 intracellular distribution and NCR-sensitive transcription. Strains used in this work were JK9-3da (MATa, leu2–3,112,ura3–52, rme1, trp1, his4,GAL+, HMLa) and TB123 (MATa, leu2–3,112,ura3–52, rme1, trp1, his4,GAL+, HMLa,GLN3-myc[kanMX4]). Cultures were grown overnight at 30 °C in Difco YNB (without ammonium sulfate or amino acids), 2% glucose, and the indicated nitrogen source. Appropriate auxotropic requirements were supplied when media other than synthetic complete (SC) (31Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W. Zheng X.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1246-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were used. Experiments in which yeast were transferred from one medium to another were performed as follows. A sample of the exponentially growing cells (A 600 nm = 0.4–0.7) was harvested from the initial medium for immunofluorescence or RNA analysis. The remaining cells in the culture were collected, washed with the new medium, recollected, and resuspended in an equal volume of the new medium. Additional samples were then collected and processed for RNA isolation or immunofluorescence at the indicated times. Precisely the same format was also used for the transfer of cells from rapamycin-free (initial medium) to rapamycin-containing (new medium) media. Rapamycin (Sigma), from a concentrated stock solution in 90% ethanol/10% Tween 20, was used at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml where indicated. Total RNA was prepared from cultures of strain JK9-3da as previously described (24Tate J.J. Cox K.H. Rai R. Cooper T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20477-20482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Total yeast RNA (9 μg) was separated on denaturing gels, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized with 32P-labeled DNA probes, and the blots were washed as previously described (24Tate J.J.

Immunofluorescent staining of yeast was carried out using a modification of the methods of Schwartzet al. (32Schwartz K. Richards K. Botstein D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2677-2691Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Cultures of strain TB123 were fixed by the addition of 1/10 volume of 37% formaldehyde and incubated with shaking at 30 °C for 10 min. They were then collected by centrifugation at room temperature and incubated in 3.7% formaldehyde in potassium phosphate buffer (40 mm, pH 6.5, containing 0.5 mm MgCl2) for 1 h. After washing and Zymolyase digestion as previously described, cells were applied to poly-l-lysine-coated microscope slides. The slides were blocked overnight at 4 °C using 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.5% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). All further antibody incubations and washes were performed in this buffer. 9E10(c-myc) (Covance MMS-150P) was used at a dilution of 1:1000 as the primary antibody and either Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) or Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) was used at a dilution of 1:200 as the secondary antibody. To visualize nuclei, 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was added to the mounting media at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml, and images were collected immediately after mounting. Cells in Figs. 1 and 2 were imaged using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with a 63× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective. Images were acquired using AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software and a Zeiss Axio camera. Alternatively, cells shown in Figs.Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9 (see below) were imaged using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 imaging microscope with a 100× Plan-Apochromat 1.40 oil objective. Images were acquired using a Zeiss Axio camera and deconvolved using AxioVision 3.0 (Zeiss) software using the constrained iterative algorithm. Three-dimensional views (see Figs. 8, E–G, and 9 below) were produced from 15 images in a two-dimensional Z-stack, spanning about 1.5 μm of the center of a yeast cell using AxioVision Inside 4D (Zeiss) software.

Cells grown in medium devoid of nitrogen are by definition growing in carbon excess. Conversely, cells grown in medium devoid of carbon are by definition growing in nitrogen excess. It was difficult to understand why Gln3 would react similarly to physiologically opposite conditions, i.e.nitrogen starvation and excess. Therefore, we investigated the phenomenon in greater detail, first by performing and then extending the critical published experiment (31Bertram P.G. Choi J.H. Carvalho J. Chan T.F., Ai, W.

The TRPV6-mediated currents are highly Ca2+-selective, show a strong inward rectification, and reverse at positive potentials, which is similar to store-operated Ca2+ entry in electrically nonexcitable cells. The gating of TRPV6 channels is strongly dependent on the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration; lowering the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration results in Ca2+ influx, and current amplitude correlates with the intracellular EGTA or BAPTA concentration. This is also the case for TRPV6-mediated currents in the absence of extracellular divalent cations; compared with endogenous currents in nontransfected rat basophilic leukemia cells, these TRPV6-mediated monovalent currents reveal differences in reversal potential, inward rectification, and slope at very negative potentials. Release of stored Ca2+by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and/or the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin appears not to be involved in TRPV6 channel gating in both cell lines but, in rat basophilic leukemia cells, readily activates the endogenous Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ current.

In nonexcitable cells the rise in [Ca2+]i1during stimulation of G-protein-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases is regulated in a complex fashion by Ca2+ release from endogenous IP3-sensitive stores followed by store-operated Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. One of the best characterized store-operated Ca2+ entry pathways is the Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+current, termed ICRAC (2Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar, 3Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Springer, New York1997Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular identity of store-operated channels is a matter of debate. Several members of the TRP family, a group of Ca2+permeable channels related to the Drosophila melanogasterTRP gene product, have been implicated in store-dependent cation influx (4Clapham D.E.

However, so far, none of the trp genes has been shown to encode channels with the ion-permeation properties and the sensitivity to store depleting agents of CRAC channels. The family of the trp genes in vertebrates can be divided into three subfamilies, based on similarities in the structures of the encoded proteins (6Montell C. Birnbaumer L. Flockerzi V. Bindels R.J.

Recently these common features between TRPV6 and CRAC channels were demonstrated by two groups (12Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E.

In contrast, Yue et al.(12Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) demonstrated activation of TRPV6 channels in CHO cells by depletion of calcium stores with IP3 and thapsigargin. This gating mechanism could be accomplished when recordings were performed 8–12 h but not 24 h after transfection (12Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). The authors assumed that, after 24 h, TRPV6 overexpression is not matched by the signal transduction apparatus presumed to be endogenously present in CHO cells and responsible for sensing store depletion. Subsequently, Yue et al. (12Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) suggested that the TRPV6 protein comprises all or a part of the CRAC pore. In the present study, two different cell lines, RBL and HEK cells, were used to study the gating of human TRPV6 channels. RBL cells are a common model system to study ICRAC, whereas in HEK cells ionic conductances associated with store depletion are not prominent (14Fasolato C. Nilius B. Pflügers Arch. 1998; 436: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 15Fierro L. Lund P.E. Parekh A.B. Pflügers Arch. 2000; 440: 580-587PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mignen O. Shuttleworth T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9114-9119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Accordingly, one could assume a higher or different expression level of the signal transduction machinery that leads to ICRAC activation, in RBL than in HEK cells. We therefore expressed the TRPV6 cDNA in both cells and studied whether there is a cell-specific modulation of TRPV6 channel function. Under conditions of high intracellular Ca2+ buffering, TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ currents develop to such an extent even in RBL cells that it swamps the current through CRAC channels. However, at low intracellular Ca2+ buffering, store depletion activates ICRAC but not TRPV6 channels, suggesting that the TRPV6 protein is not sensitive to store depletion under these conditions. Instead, TRPV6 channels function as Ca2+-sensing Ca2+ pores and their current amplitudes are inversely correlated with the [Ca2+]i. HEK-293 (ATCC, 1573-CRL) and RBL-1 cells (ATTC, 1378-CRL) were from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Minimum essential medium with Earle's salts andl-glutamine was used for HEK cells and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium including l-glutamine, sodium pyruvate, and 1000 mg/liter d-glucose for RBL cells. Both culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cell lines were grown in a 5% CO2 humidified incubator at 37 °C.

Patch-clamp experiments were conducted in the tight-seal whole-cell configuration (18Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15141) Google Scholar) using an EPC-9 amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht, Germany). Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (Kimax®) and had resistances between 2 and 3 megohms when filled with the standard internal solution containing (in mm): 145 cesium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 8 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 Mg-ATP adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. When using high intracellular chelator concentrations (30 and 60 mm), the osmolarity was kept constant by appropriate reduction of cesium glutamate. The intracellular Mg-ATP concentration was increased to 6 mm for the experiments in the absence of external divalent cations. This was done to minimize contamination of monovalent currents presumably mediated by endogenously expressed TRPM7 channels in HEK and RBL cells (19Nadler M.J. Hermosura M.C. Inabe K. Perraud A.L. Zhu Q. Stokes A.J. Kurosaki T. Kinet J.P. Penner R. Scharenberg A.M. Fleig A. Nature. 2001; 411: 590-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). The Mg2+-free pipette solution contained 10 mm EGTA, Na2-ATP instead of the Mg2+ salt and no addition of MgCl2 to study the time-dependent removal of the intracellular Mg2+ block. The series resistances were typically in the range of 5–10 megohms and not electronically compensated. Currents were filtered using an 8-pole Bessel filter at 8 kHz and digitized at 100 μs. Voltage-clamp recordings were performed using ramps (−110 mV to +90 mV in 50 ms) applied every 2 s using PULSE software (HEKA Electronics) on a personal computer. Cells were held at −10 mV between ramps. Several parameters (capacitance, series resistance, holding current) were displayed simultaneously at a slower rate (2 Hz) using the X-Chart display (HEKA Electronics). The membrane potential values were corrected for 10-mV liquid junction potential. No additional voltage correction was performed for the experiments under divalent-free conditions. Effects of changes in surface charge screening were ignored. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (20–23 °C); internal solutions were kept on ice to minimize hydrolysis of the nucleotides. For Northern blot analysis, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from rat duodenum and from RBL cells were separated by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels and thereafter transferred to Hybond N nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences Europe, Freiburg, Germany) as described (7Wissenbach U. Niemeyer B.A. Fixemer T. Schneidewind A. Trost C. Cavalie A. Reus K. Meese E. Bonkhoff H. Flockerzi V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19461-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The membranes were hybridized in the presence of 50% formamide at 42 °C overnight. No additional signals were detected if the exposure time was 1 week. The probe was the 1539-bp ApaI cDNA fragment of rat TRPV6 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBankTM, accession no. AF160798) encoding amino acid residues 208–721 and the 345-bpEcoRI/BamHI fragment of human TRPV6 (amino acid residues 528–643), both labeled by random priming with [α-32P]dCTP. Analysis was performed with PulseFit and programs written in the IGOR macro language (Wave Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Ca2+ currents elicited by voltage ramps were leak-subtracted by subtracting either the first ramp in TRPV6-transfected cells or by averaging the first two to four ramps after establishing the whole-cell mode in untransfected cells (depending on how fast ICRAC developed) and then subtracting the mean from all subsequent traces. This type of analysis is well established for ICRAC measurements in RBL cells and was also used for TRPV6-expressing cells to allow a better comparison of the data in Figs. 2 and 3. No background current subtraction was performed for the data from TRPV6-expressing cells shown in Figs.1 A, 4 A, and Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8. The peak current amplitude was measured after leak subtraction at −80 mV for the data presented in the dose-response curve in Fig. 4 B. However, no reliable values could be determined for the lowest EGTA concentration tested (0.1 mm) and for the experiments with 100 nm[Ca2+]i and 1.05 mm[Mg2+]i (clamped by either 10 mm EGTA, 3.64 mm CaCl2, and 3.08 mm Mg2+ or 60 mm EGTA, 21.84 mm CaCl2, and 3.46 mmMg2+ in the pipette solution). No current activated under these conditions and amplitudes was measured 1 min after establishing the whole-cell configuration, because TRPV6 channels fully activate usually within this time. The global [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i were calculated by custom software (0.58, 1.16, 3.49, 11.66, 23.31, 34.97, 69.91, and 348.59 pm [Ca2+]i; and 0.64, 0.79, 0.95, 1.02, 1.03, 1.04, 1.04, and 1.05 mm[Mg2+]i at 60, 30, 10, 3, 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 mm EGTA, respectively).

Ca2+ currents were recorded from TRPV6-expressing HEK cells using intracellular solutions at two different [Ca2+]i and [Mg2+]i each. The standard pipette solution supplemented with 60 mm EGTA had calculated [Ca2+]i of 580 fm and [Mg2+]i was 637 μm(n = 10). The addition of 730 μmMgCl2 (1.73 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm Mg-ATP in total) to this solution increased [Mg2+]i to 1.05 mm, whereas the [Ca2+]i was unaffected (n = 11). The same [Mg2+]i was adjusted in the third intracellular solution (1.08 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm Mg-ATP), and the [Ca2+]i was clamped at 100 nm with 10 mm EGTA and 3.6 mmCaCl2 (n = 5). Averaged current traces are shown without correction for the initial current.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All chemicals were purchased from Sigma, except BAPTA (Molecular Probes). In TRPV6-transfected HEK cells, a large current was elicited by voltage ramps when [Ca2+]i was buffered by 10 mm EGTA in the patch pipette (Fig.1). The inwardly rectifying current reversed at positive potentials (≥30 mV, n = 5). At potentials more negative to −40 mV the current showed a fast inactivation (time constant of 7.6 ± 1.3 ms at −100 mV,n = 5). No such current was recorded in the absence of external Ca2+ from TRPV6-transfected HEK cells (data not shown, n = 5). Mock and nontransfected cells exhibited a small background current with a linear I-V relationship (data not shown, n = 5 each). The biophysical properties of heterologously expressed TRPV6 channels are similar to those of endogenous store-operated channels in RBL cells (Fig. 1 B). Both currents show a strong inward rectification with a positive reversal potential, indicating a high Ca2+selectivity. It has been argued for the TRPV6 protein from rat that this channel is only store-operated when its expression level stands in a special relation to the native signal transduction machinery of CHO cells (12Yue L. Peng J.B. Hediger M.A. Clapham D.E. Nature. 2001; 410: 705-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This idea was tested by expressing the human clone in RBL cells, which show a much more pronounced ICRAC than CHO and HEK cells. Subsequently, RBL cells might offer a more native environment for store-operated channels than HEK cells. Whether this affects the gating of TRPV6 channels was tested in the following experiments. ICRAC is gated by the filling state of IP3-sensitive Ca2+ stores. It can be activated by store depletion obtained by intracellular perfusion of IP3, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin, and/or EGTA. Using IP3 (30 μm) and EGTA (10 mm) in the internal solution resulted in rapid activation of ICRAC(Fig. 2). TRPV6-expressing HEK cells showed a rapid current activation followed by a slow inactivation until a steady-state level was reached (Fig. 2). This was also the case for TRPV6-expressing RBL cells; immediately after obtaining the whole-cell configuration, the Ca2+ current developed, reached a maximum, and subsequently decayed to a lower level (Fig. 2). Very similar results were obtained with thapsigargin (2 μm) instead of IP3 or both substances (TableI); ICRAC activated rapidly in RBL cells, no prominent current was detected in HEK cells, and a large inward current was measured in TRPV6-expressing HEK and RBL cells such as shown in Figs. 1 and 2. No significant differences between both cell types were detected with respect to the peak Ca2+current, activation, and inactivation kinetics.Table IPeak current amplitudes in TRPV6-expressing HEK and RBL cells under various intracellular conditionsHEK-TRPV6RBL-TRPV6EGTA + thapsigargin + IP3−17.0 ± 2.9 (6)−25.6 ± 4.6 (3)EGTA + thapsigargin−23.8 ± 4.2 (3)−25.2 ± 3.9 (3)EGTA + IP3−22.2 ± 5.7 (4)−26.3 ± 4.2 (5)EGTA−18.2 ± 2.7 (7)−19.1 ± 1.2 (3)Ca2+ currents were recorded from TRPV6-transfected HEK and RBL cells.

The bath solution contained 10 mM Ca2+. Cells were clamped at −10 mV, and maximal inward currents were measured at −80 mV during repetitive voltage ramps after background current subtraction as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Mean data ± S.E. (n) are given. The activation of ICRAC by high concentrations of the Ca2+ buffer EGTA (10 mm) in the intracellular solution is much slower than in the recordings with IP3and/or thapsigargin (Fig. 2). Strikingly, the activation kinetic of TRPV6-mediated Ca2+ currents was not changed in both expression systems tested. Similar results were obtained with BAPTA instead of EGTA (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the presence of store-depleting agents such as thapsigargin and IP3 does not influence TRPV6 channel activation. It is possible to record ICRAC under conditions of moderate cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering (20Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14445-14451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). With low concentrations of EGTA (1.5 mm) and the addition of IP3 (30 μm) in the pipette solution, peak current amplitude in RBL wild-type cells was similar to the recordings"

E-cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesion is also important for maintenance of epithelial structural integrity, and loss of E-cadherin expression has been correlated with enhanced invasive potential in multiple tumor models. To address the hypothesis that there is a functional link between E-cadherin and proteinase expression, we have examined the role of E-cadherin in proteinase regulation. By using a calcium switch protocol to manipulate junction assembly, our data demonstrate that initiation of de novoE-cadherin-mediated adhesive contacts suppresses expression of both relative matrix metalloproteinase-9 levels and net urinary-type plasminogen activator activity. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion increases both phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase)-dependent AKT phosphorylation and epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent MAPK/ERK activation. Pharmacologic inhibition of the PI3-kinase pathway, but not the epidermal growth factor receptor/MAPK pathway, prevents E-cadherin-mediated suppression of proteinases and delays junction assembly. Moreover, inhibition of junction assembly with a function-blocking anti-E-cadherin antibody stimulates proteinase-dependent Matrigel invasion. As matrix metalloproteinase-9 and urinary-type plasminogen activator potentiate the invasive activity of oral squamous cell carcinoma, these data suggest E-cadherin-mediated signaling through PI3-kinase can regulate the invasive behavior of cells by modulating proteinase secretion.

MMPs are a large family of metalloendopeptidases with activity directed against a variety of extracellular matrix substrates (11Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998Google Scholar). MMP-9 (gelatinase B), a 92-kDa gelatinase that efficiently degrades native type IV collagen, has been implicated in tumor dissemination, as evidenced by enhanced MMP-9 expression in tumor samples exhibiting matrix invasion and distant metastases (12Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 115-148Crossref Google Scholar). This is supported by studies using tumor-bearing MMP-9-deficient mice, which exhibit decreased propensity to develop metastatic foci, indicating that MMP-9 plays a critical role in tumor development (5Itoh T. Tanioka M. Matsuda H. Nishimoto H. Yoshioka T. Suzuki R. Uehira M. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1999; 17: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Post-translational regulation of MMP-9 activity is mediated by interaction with tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1 which forms a 1:1 noncovalent inactive enzyme-inhibitor complex (12Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 115-148Crossref Google Scholar). Under many conditions, secretion of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 is coordinately regulated (12Vu T.H. Werb Z. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego1998: 115-148Crossref Google Scholar). In addition to MMP-9, up-regulation of uPA expression has also been correlated with malignant progression of a wide variety of neoplasms (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). uPA is a serine proteinase that functions in the conversion of the circulating zymogen plasminogen to the active enzyme plasmin (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Plasmin is a broad spectrum serine proteinase that can directly cleave a number of protein substrates (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), as well as activate many additional proteinase zymogens including pro-MMP-9 (13Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Adv. Cancer Res. 2000; 78: 103-157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). uPA is localized to the cell surface via interaction with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored receptor, designated uPA receptor or uPAR (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). Proteolytic activity is also regulated by the serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) which forms a covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex with both free and receptor-localized uPA (9Andreasen P.A. Kjoller L. Christensen L. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 72: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar). In a number of tumor models, down-regulation of either uPA or its receptor decreases invasion and reduces metastatic potential (14Yu H.R. Schultz R.M. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 7623-7633PubMed Google Scholar,15Kook Y.H. Adamski J. Zelent A. Ossowski L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3983-3991Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Like proteolytic enzymes, dysregulation of adhesion molecules is often observed in malignant cells. Cadherins are a family of cell surface adhesion molecules that participate in Ca2+-dependent cell-cell adhesion (16Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 629-641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and thus are essential for maintenance of tissue integrity. E-cadherin is a widely distributed transmembrane intercellular adhesion molecule (17Takeichi M. Science. 1991; 251: 1451-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). In addition to functioning in cell-cell adhesion, the cytoplasmic tail of E-cadherin binds to β- or γ-catenin/plakoglobin, thereby providing a mechanism for association with additional proteins, including signaling molecules such as phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (PI3-kinase) and epidermal growth factor receptor (18Provost E.

To address the hypothesis that there is a functional link between E-cadherin and proteinase expression, in the current study we have examined the role of E-cadherin in the regulation of proteinase expression in premalignant oral keratinocytes. Our data demonstrate that initiation of de novo E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion suppresses both relative MMP-9 levels and net uPA activity in premalignant oral keratinocytes. Concomitant with decreased proteinase expression, secretion of TIMP-1 and PAI-1 is also down-regulated. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion increases PI3-kinase-dependent AKT activation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) activation. Inhibition of the PI3-kinase pathway, but not the EGFR-MAPK pathway, interferes with formation of adherens junctions and prevents E-cadherin-mediated suppression of proteinases. Furthermore, prevention of junction assembly with a function-blocking E-cadherin antibody stimulates proteinase-dependent Matrigel invasion. Together these data support the hypothesis that E-cadherin-mediated signaling via PI3-kinase can regulate the invasive behavior of cells by modulating proteinase expression.

Early passage (between 3 and 8) pp126 cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in keratinocyte-SFM containing 0.09 mm calcium and supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml EGF, and 50 μg/ml bovine pituitary extract. The calcium switch method was utilized to assess the consequences of de novo E-cadherin activation (19Pece S. Chiariello M. Murga C. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol.

After 24 h, the cells were starved for 6–8 h, and calcium was removed by incubation with Keratinocyte-SFM containing 4 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2at 37 °C. After 30 min the calcium-free medium was removed, and Keratinocyte-SFM containing 0.09 mm calcium was immediately added to induce E-cadherin mediated cell-cell interactions (designated “E-cadherin activation +”). In control experiments, cells received fresh media in the absence of EGTA such that original junctions are maintained, but de novo activation of E-cadherin is not induced (designated “E-cadherin activation −”). In selected experiments, either anti-E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1 clone) or isotype-specific control antibody was added to the calcium-containing medium at 10 μg/ml. In additional studies, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (5 μm), the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (250 nm), or the appropriate vehicle was added to the medium. Conditioned medium was collected for proteinase analysis after 24–36 h. pp126 cells were grown on glass coverslips at 37 °C in Keratinocyte-SFM. Following a 30-min incubation with serum-free medium containing 4 mm EGTA and 1 mm MgCl2, cells were incubated with Keratinocyte-SFM containing 0.09 mm Ca2+ in the presence of either control IgG antibody or anti-E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1, 10 μg/ml). In additional studies, the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm), the MEK inhibitor PD98059 (5 μm), the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (250 nm), or the appropriate vehicle was added to the medium. For immunofluorescence staining, cells were washed with PBS and fixed with ice-cold methanol for 2 min or with 3.7% formaldehyde for 5 min followed by 0.5% Triton X-100 for 7 min. After washing with PBS, cells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated with mouse anti-E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1) or rat anti-E-cadherin antibody (DECMA) for 1 h at 37 °C. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse or anti-rat antibody. Glass coverslips were washed with PBS three times, mounted, and examined under a UV microscope (Nikon) using the appropriate filter. Gelatinase activities in the conditioned media at 36 h were determined using SDS-PAGE gelatin zymography as described previously (33Munshi H.G. Stack M.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, SDS-PAGE gels (9% acrylamide) were co-polymerized with 0.1% gelatin, and samples were electrophoresed without reduction or boiling using 5× Laemmli sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar). SDS was removed through a 30-min incubation in 2.5% Triton X-100, and gels were incubated in 20 mmglycine, pH 8.3, 10 mm CaCl2, 1 μm ZnCl2 at 37 °C for 24–36 h. The gels were stained with Coomassie Blue to visualize zones of gelatinolytic activity. MMP-9 levels in the conditioned media were also quantified by ELISA (Oncogene Research Products) following concentration of the conditioned media 25–30-fold with Microcon 10. Levels of TIMP-1 protein in the conditioned media were quantified by ELISA (Oncogene Research Products) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Net uPA activity in the conditioned media at 24 h was quantified using a coupled assay to monitor plasminogen activation and resulting hydrolysis of a colorimetric substrate (Val-Leu-Lys-p-nitroanilide) as described previously (28Stack S. Gonzalez-Gronow M. Pizzo S.V. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4966-4970Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Levels of PAI-1 protein in the conditioned media were quantified by ELISA (American Diagnostica) according to the manufacturer's specifications. pp126 cells were grown in a 6-well plate, washed with ice-cold PBS, and incubated at 4 °C with gentle shaking for 30 min with 0.5 mg/ml cell-impermeable Sulfo-NHS-Biotin in ice-cold PBS, followed by washing with 100 mm glycine to quench free biotin. Cells were then detached by scraping, lysed in modified RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% SDS) with proteinase inhibitors, and clarified by centrifugation. To isolate biotinylated cell-surface proteins, equal amounts of protein from each of the samples were incubated with streptavidin beads at 4 °C for 14 h, followed by centrifugation. After boiling in Laemmli sample dilution buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) to dissociate streptavidin bead-biotin complexes, the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels) and immunoblotted for uPAR (1:1000, American Diagnostica, clone 399R). E-cadherin was activated by the calcium switch method as described above, and at the indicated time points cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer containing 20 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, and 10 μm leupeptin. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (9% gels), and the blots were probed with anti-ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) or with anti-AKT antibody (1:1000) to detect total ERK1/2 or AKT expression or with anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 antibody (1:1000) or anti-phosphorylated AKT antibody (1:1000) to detect active (phosphorylated) forms of ERK or AKT. Invasive activity was quantified using a Boyden Chamber (8-μm pore size) coated with Matrigel (10 μg). Cells (2 × 105) were added to the chamber in 500 μl of serum-free medium with 25 μg/ml of E-cadherin function-blocking antibody (HECD-1 clone) or isotype-specific control antibody, followed by incubation for 40 h. Nonmigrating cells were removed from the upper chamber with a cotton swab; filters were fixed and stained with Diff-Quik Stain, and migrating cells adherent to the underside of the filter were enumerated using an ocular micrometer and counting a minimum of 10 high-powered fields. Data are expressed as relative migration (number of cells/field). In selected experiments, the proteinase dependence of invasion was determined by quantifying invasion in the presence of the MMP inhibitor GM6001 (2.5 μm) (Chemicon) or the function-blocking anti-uPA antibody (15 μg/ml) (American Diagnostica, clone 394). E-cadherin dependent cell-cell adhesion is important for the maintenance of epithelial structural integrity, and the loss of E-cadherin expression has been shown to correlate with increased invasive potential of both carcinoma cell lines and human tumor samples (21Laprise P.

Control cells present a typical pattern of E-cadherin staining at the level of cell-cell contacts (Fig.1 A); however, in cells treated with EGTA, E-cadherin is absent from cell junctions (Fig.1 B). After addition of calcium, adherens junctions are again formed (Fig. 1 C), with complete restoration by 1 h of treatment (Fig. 1 D). To evaluate the effect of E-cadherin activation on proteinase expression, after 24–36 h conditioned media were collected and analyzed. Gelatin zymography demonstrated that calcium-mediated cell-cell adhesion (designated E-cad Actn +) decreased relative MMP-9 levels (Fig. 1 E). This was confirmed using an ELISA kit that recognizes both free and TIMP-1-complexed MMP-9, demonstrating a 6.5-fold decrease in MMP-9 levels in concentrated conditioned media following calcium-mediated cell-cell adhesion (Fig. 1 E). Concomitant with MMP-9 down-regulation, net uPA activity was also decreased by 2–3-fold (Fig. 1 F). Evaluation of proteinase inhibitor expression by ELISA indicated a coordinate decrease in both TIMP-1 and PAI-1 levels (Table I). Disruption of cell-cell junctions using the calcium switch method did not affect cell proliferation (data not shown).Table ICalcium-mediated cell-cell attachment suppresses TIMP-1 and PAI-1E-cad activationTIMP-1PAI-1ng/ml−72 ± 340 ± 2+45 ± 31-aValue significantly different from control with p <0.005.16 ± 11-bValue significantly different from control with p <0.001.E-cadherin (E-cad)-mediated cell-cell adhesion was disrupted by incubating pp 126 cells with 4 mm EGTA for 30 min and then re-initiated by replacing the medium with calcium-containing keratinocyte-SFM (0.09 mm, designated E-cad activation +).

Conditioned media were collected after 24–36 h, and TIMP-1 and PAI-1 levels were analyzed by ELISA according to the manufacturer's specifications. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of three individual experiments. To confirm that proteinase suppression is due to E-cadherin engagement and is not an unrelated consequence of calcium modulation, a function-blocking anti-E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1 clone) was utilized. To verify that the HECD-1 antibody blocked cell-cell attachment following the calcium switch protocol, cells were treated with EGTA to dissociate cell-cell junctions and then incubated for 40 min in calcium-containing medium in the presence of either function-blocking E-cadherin antibody (HECD-1, 10 μg/ml) or isotype-matched control IgG. Cells were then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using rat anti-E-cadherin antibody (DECMA clone). Similar to the control experiment shown in Fig. 1 B, no E-cadherin staining is visible at cell-cell junctions following EGTA treatment (Fig. 2 A). Following calcium restoration, junctional E-cadherin is prevalent in IgG-treated cells (Fig. 2 B), but not in anti-E-cadherin-treated cells (Fig. 2 C), demonstrating that the antibody indeed blocks cell-cell attachment. To assess the effect of E-cadherin function blocking antibodies on proteinase suppression, cell-cell junctions were disrupted by calcium chelation, and junction assembly was initiated by the addition of calcium in the presence of blocking antibody (10 μg/ml) to prevent formation of adherens junctions. Control samples contained an equal concentration of isotype-specific IgG. In additional controls, antibodies were added without prior disruption of cell-cell junctions by calcium chelation (designated E"

https://openalex.org/W2314879531,"Cyclin dependent kinases are regulated by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the catalytic cdk subunits, by assembly with specific cyclins and by specific inhibitor molecules. Recently, it turned out that cyclins are also phosphoproteins, which means that they are also potential targets for a regulation by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. Here, we show that cyclin H was phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2. Like most other CK2 substrates cyclin H was much better phosphorylated by the CK2 holoenzyme than by the α-subunit alone. By using point mutants derived from the cyclin H sequence we mapped the CK2 phosphorylation site at threonine 315 at the C-terminal end of cyclin H. Phosphorylation at this position had no influence on the assembly of the cyclin H/cdk7/Mat1 complex. However, phosphorylation at amino acid 315 of cyclin H turned out to be critical for a full cyclin H/cdk7/Mat1 kinase activity when the CTD peptide of RNA polymerase II or cdk2 was used as a substrate."

Integrins in solution appear in electron micrographs as a globular head with two legs, with the total length from tip to tip including the globular head being ∼40 nm. The legs of αIIbβ3 are flexible and emerge from the same side of the head, with their tips either separated but never reaching a diametrical disposition (the head-free tail shapes), touching (the empty oval shapes) or overlapping (the bilobular shapes) each other, or fully folded on themselves and on the head (the filled globular shapes) (18Rivas G.A.

This high degree of flexibility of the tails of the heterodimer, seen in electron micrographs and deduced from the crystallographic structure, accounts for the short rotational correlation times measured in Triton X-100 solutions by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy. 1M.

González-Rodrı́guez, unpublished data.Given its high segmental mobility, αIIbβ3should adopt a large variety of shapes also in the membrane, where its lateral and rotational mobility has been measured (19González-Rodrı́guez J. Acuña A.U. Alvarez M.V. Jovin T.M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 266-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20Schootemeijer A. van Willigen G. van der Vuurst H. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. Akkerman J.W.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The integrin model that locates the subunit N-terminal domains at the globular head and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains at the tail ends was based on a combination of the morphological results and secondary structure prediction (21Nermut M.V. Green N.M. Eason P. Yamada S.S. Yamada K.M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the crystallographic structure. Electron micrographs of fibrinogen-αIIbβ3 complexes suggest that the fibrinogen-binding site(s) is located at the integrin globular head (22Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the cysteine-rich and proteinase-resistant core of β3 (β3-(423–622)) was tentatively localized in one of the heterodimer tails (23Wippler J. Kouns W.C. Schlaeger E.-J. Kuhn H. Hadvary P. Steiner B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8754-8761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the sequences of the epitopes for monoclonal antibodies B1B5 (located at the C-terminal end of the αIIb heavy chain) and LIBS2 (located within β3-(602–690)) were also assigned to the ends of one of the tails (22Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Vilaire G. Bennett J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16637-16643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Du X., Gu, M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Bennett J.S. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The latter sequence was thought to be joined by the Cys406–Cys655 disulfide bond to the mid-region of β3 (not confirmed in the crystal structure), which was also joined to the N-terminal end by the Cys5–Cys435 disulfide bond (6Calvete J.J. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 274: 63-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Recently, the crystal structure of αvβ3 confirmed the metal ion-dependent adhesion site proposed earlier in the N-terminal region of β3 (MIDAS domain) (25Tozer E.C. Liddington R.C. Sutcliffe M.J. Smeeton A.H. Loftus J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21978-21984Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and the β propeller with seven blades predicted in the N-terminal domain of the α subunits (26Springer T.A Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, discrepancies appeared in the disulfide arrangement of β3 proposed by protein chemical methods, x-ray diffraction, and NMR. Based on several pieces of evidence, a two-state allosteric model of integrin activation had been proposed (27Loftus J.C. Liddington R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final effector(s) for the proposed allosteric transition has not been identified (4Shattil S.J. Kashiwagi H. Pampori N. Blood. 1998; 91: 2645-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and information on the structure and disposition of the integrin in the membrane, both at rest and after activation, is lacking. It has been known for some time that ADP- and thrombin-activated platelets (1Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Prog. Hemostasis Thromb. 1989; 9: 117-156PubMed Google Scholar), as well as platelets activated with some monoclonal antibodies (28Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.-P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), differ in their specificity for the binding of adhesive proteins and monoclonal antibodies. Additionally, antibodies AP3 and Tab completely abolish ADP- induced platelet aggregation and secretion without impairing fibrinogen binding; however, thrombin-activated platelets neither aggregate nor bind fibrinogen in the presence of both antibodies (29Newman P.J. McEver R.P. Doer M.P. Kunicki T.J. Blood. 1987; 69: 668-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, some anti-αIIb and anti-β3 antibodies show agonist-dependent immunochemical inhibition of platelet aggregation in vitro (30de Castellarnau C. Cullaré C. Alvarez M.V. Muñiz-Diez E. Calzada M.J. González-Rodrı́guez J. Platelets. 1997; 8: 243-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest the existence of agonist-specific activated states of αIIbβ3 or different agonist-dependent membrane vicinities of the activated receptor. The existence of activated states differing in ligand affinity has been shown before for other integrins (31Masumoto A. Hemler M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 228-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Ortlepp S. Stephens P.E. Hogg N. Figdor C.G. Bobinson M.K. Eur. J.

On the other hand, “activated” forms of αIIbβ3 have been generated in cells, in whole platelets, and in solution by site-directed mutagenesis (36O'Tool T.E. Loftus J.C., Du, X. Glass A.A. Ruiggeri Z.M. Shattil S.J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Cell Reg. 1991; 1: 883-893Crossref Scopus (224) Google Scholar), interaction with RGD peptides (24Du X., Gu, M. Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C.

Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17106-17111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), chemical reduction of disulfides (37Yan B. Smith J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 8861-8897Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), etc.; however, we lack information on the structural differences between the resting and activated forms. Agonist-specific activation states of αIIbβ3 in the cell can be demonstrated by agonist-specific antibody recognition patterns. In this work, we have used a collection of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)2 directed against the calf-2 domain of αIIb and the βA domain of β3, whose epitopes have been located in their primary structures by protein chemical and immunochemical analyses (Refs. 7Calvete J.J.

Biochem. 1984; 141: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar and this work). Competition among these antibodies for binding to whole platelets at rest and to ADP-, thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP)-, and arachidonic acid (AA)-activated platelets was quantified by bound-phase separation assays. The structural features deduced from the antibody competition patterns in resting platelets differ from those deduced from the patterns in ADP-, TRAP-, and AA-activated platelets, and the latter differ among themselves. We have compared these two-dimensional low resolution topographical maps and discussed them in relation to the structural and functional information currently available for integrin αIIbβ3, and we have concluded that the maps are consistent with the existence of conformationally different agonist-dependent activation states of the integrin and with the bent structure both at rest and after activation and therefore inconsistent with the switchblade mechanism proposed for integrin activation (12Beglova N. Blacklow S.C. Takagi J. Springer T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 282-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Blood samples were collected from healthy volunteers, and 9 volumes of blood were anticoagulated with 1 volume of 0.129 m trisodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma was prepared by sedimentation of red and white blood cells at 150 × g for 10 min. Washed platelets were prepared by gel filtration on a Sepharose 2B column equilibrated with Tyrode's buffer, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 5 mm glucose without calcium. Integrin αIIbβ3 was prepared from the membrane fraction of outdated human platelets as described (39Rivas G.A. Calvete J.J. González-Rodrı́guez J. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The purified protein, free from salts and detergent, was freeze-dried and stored in liquid nitrogen. The αIIb and β3 subunits were prepared from pure αIIbβ3 as described previously (39Rivas G.A. Calvete J.J. González-Rodrı́guez J. Protein Expression Purif. 1991; 2: 248-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The murine mAbs specific for β3 (P6, P23-7, P37, P40, P95-1, P95-2, and P97) and αIIb (Mβ1, Mβ2, Mβ3, Mβ4, Mβ5, M3, M6, M9, M10, and Mα2), all of the IgG class, were prepared according to immunization and fusion protocols and screening assays described previously (38Melero J.A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The antibodies were purified from ascites fluid after 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 precipitation. The 50% saturated (NH4)2SO4 precipitate was subjected to affinity chromatography on protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The purification process was monitored by SDS-PAGE and enzyme immunoassay. Purified antibodies were labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at pH 8.0–9.0 and filtered through a Sephadex G-50 column (1 × 40 cm) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline to separate the free dye. After clearing by centrifugation, the protein and bound dye in the FITC-antibody conjugates were measured spectrophotometrically at 280 and 495 nm, respectively, with the dye/protein molar ratio being between 2 and 5. The labeled antibodies were monitored by enzyme immunoassay and SDS-PAGE, and their affinity for αIIbβ3 in solution was measured by enzyme immunoassay (40Friguet B. Chaffote A.F. Djavadi-Ohaniance L. Goldberg M.E. J. Immunol. Methods. 1985; 11: 305-319Crossref Scopus (1125) Google Scholar). Concentrated solutions of antibodies were stored in liquid nitrogen. Proteins (41Markwell M.A.K. Haas S.M. Bieber L.L. Tolbert N.E. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 87: 206-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (5297) Google Scholar) and free sulfhydryl groups and disulfide bonds (42Thannhauser T.W. Konishi Y. Scheraga H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were determined as described previously. SDS-PAGE was carried out according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 277: 680-685Crossref Scopus (206271) Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, gel electrophoresis bands were transferred to nitrocellulose or Immobilon by a standard procedure (44Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44724) Google Scholar). The goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody was affinity-purified and peroxidase-conjugated. The early 23- and 80-kDa tryptic fragments obtained by digestion of the β3subunit were prepared and characterized as described previously (7Calvete J.J. Arias J. Alvarez M.V. López M.M. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 457-463Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The selective chemical reduction of the interchain disulfide bond of αIIb and the isolation and analysis of the two chains were performed following earlier work (8Calvete J.J. Arias J. Alvarez M.V. Lopez M.M. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 767-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The affinity of the antibodies for αIIbβ3 in whole platelets and the number of binding sites per platelet were measured as follows. Increasing concentrations of the FITC-antibody conjugates were mixed with 5–10 μl of platelet-rich plasma (1.5–3 × 106 platelets) and brought to 50 μl with Tyrode's buffer, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mmCaCl2 (equivalent to 5–10 nmαIIbβ3). After a 1-h incubation at 20 °C, the mixtures were loaded on top of 20% sucrose in 400-μl microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 rpm. After, the tip of the tubes was cut and isolated using a razor blade, the supernatant was aspirated off the upper part, which was removed after thoroughly being washed and dried. The pellet was solubilized in 300 μl of 0.1% SDS, and FITC-bound mAbs were measured in an SLM-AMINCO 8000 spectrofluorometer (excitation at 492 nm and emission at 530 nm). In experiments with activated platelets, 100 μmADP, 20 μm TRAP, or 1 mm AA (final concentrations) was added with brief and gentle mixing (to avoid platelet aggregation) before antibody addition, and the samples were left resting for 1 h at room temperature. In the latter experiments, visual controls under the microscope were routinely done to check that the platelets had aggregated, but only after thorough mixing. Binding isotherms were constructed and fitted to a single binding site model to obtain the K d and the number of antibody-binding sites per platelet using Origin Version 5 (Microcal). FITC-labeled monoclonal antibody and competitive unlabeled antibody were added to 5–10 μl of human platelet-rich plasma (adjusted to 3 × 105 platelets/μl) to reach final concentrations just below the K d (dissociation constant) for the labeled antibody and 5–10-fold greater than theK d for the unlabeled antibody. The mixture was brought to a final incubation volume of 50 μl with Tyrode's buffer, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm CaCl2. Competition among antibodies for binding to human platelets was assayed by spectrofluorometric quantification of the platelet-bound FITC-labeled monoclonal antibodies after separation of the free and bound FITC-labeled antibodies by sedimentation as described above. Every antibody in the set was labeled and subjected to binding competition with the rest of the unlabeled antibodies. The results of the competition experiments in percent inhibition of binding of labeled antibodies by unlabeled antibodies were introduced in double-entry square tables: one entry for labeled (analysis) antibodies and the other for unlabeled (competition) antibodies. We considered paired antibodies to have competed sterically with each other when the percent inhibition for the pair in both entries was >75%. From the binary square matrix of data, which indicate the ability of paired antibodies to bind simultaneously or not to the antigen, the x-y coordinates for each antibody epitope were adjusted according to the experimental data to construct the two-dimensional map of the relative distribution of the antibody epitopes on the receptor surface. For this, we considered an average epitope area of 7 nm2 and assigned the 0,0 coordinates to the epitope of the antibody that competed reciprocally with the highest number of antibodies in the set. The representation was done with Grapher Version 4 (Golden Software), with the position of non-overlapping epitopes being totally arbitrary. The extent and rate of platelet aggregation in platelet-rich plasma, prepared as indicated above, were measured at 37 °C under constant stirring in a spectrophotometer. Inhibition by anti-αIIb and anti-β3 monoclonal antibodies of platelet aggregation induced by ADP, TRAP, and AA was expressed as a percentage of the decrease in the extent of aggregation with respect to the extent of aggregation of sample controls without antibody. Tryptic digestion of β3 in solution allows the selective and sequential cleavage of the Arg–X and Lys–X peptide bonds of β3(Arg216–Asp217, Arg261–Leu262, and Lys302–Asn303), which are more accessible in solution. After selective reduction and alkylation of the β3 Cys5–Cys435 disulfide bond in the digestion mixture, the following fragments were sequentially obtained: 80 kDa (β3-(217–762)), 23 kDa (β3-(1–216)), 70 kDa (β3-(262–762)), 17 kDa (β3-(1–150)), and 52 kDa (β3-(303–762)), as shown previously (7Calvete J.J. Arias J. Alvarez M.V. López M.M. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 457-463Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Using enzyme immunoassay and immunoelectroblotting, it was found that the epitope for P6 is resistant to degradation, and it was located in the 80-, 70-, and 50-kDa peptides. Given that it is exposed in whole platelets, its final location was limited to β3-(303–692). The epitopes for P23-7 and P37 were found in the 23-kDa N-terminal fragment (β3-(1–216)), as described previously (7Calvete J.J. Arias J. Alvarez M.V. López M.M. Henschen A. González-Rodrı́guez J. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 457-463Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar), where the epitopes for P40, P95-1, P95-2, and P97 were now also located. Of all these epitopes, that for P23-7 was the only one remaining in the 17-kDa fragment (β3-(1–150)) (Fig.1 A). Given that these epitopes are resistant to reduction and alkylation and given that the 23- and 17-kDa fragments are not internally cleaved, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE after full reduction and alkylation, the epitopes for P37, P40, P95-1, P95-2, and P97 were now located in β3-(150–216). Immunoelectroblotting and enzyme immunoassay detected the location of the M9 epitope in the heavy chain of αIIb, whereas the epitopes for Mβ2, Mβ3, Mβ4, and Mβ5 were located in the light chain of αIIb (Fig. 1 B). Given that the latter antibodies bind to whole platelets, their epitopes were located in the N terminus and extracellular domain of the light chain (αIIbL2-(1–92)). On the other hand, the epitope for M10 was destroyed by selective reduction of the interchain disulfide bond αIIbH Cys826–αIIbL2Cys9 of the αIIb subunit, but not by denaturation; therefore, we located this epitope in the interchain region formed by the C terminus of αIIbH and the N terminus of αIIbL. The K d values for the binding of the anti-αIIb and anti-β3 FITC-mAb complexes in intact platelets at rest and after ADP, TRAP, and AA activation together with the number of mAb-binding sites per platelet and the epitope localization for each antibody are given in TableI. Examples of isotherms for binding for some anti-αIIb and anti-β3 antibodies to resting and activated platelets are given in Fig.2. For a given mAb, theK d is generally higher for the isolated subunits (data not shown) and lower for the heterodimer in whole platelets, as expected, given that these antibodies were raised by animal immunization with isolated subunits or subunit fragments. TheK d values in whole platelets ranged from 5 to 700 nm. An unexpected result is the wide range found for the number of mAb-binding sites per platelet for the different antibodies, ranging from 40 to 80 × 103. The total number of molecules of αIIb and β3/platelet determined in platelet homogenates by enzyme immunoassay was 98,382 ± 11,818 and 113,612 ± 11,800, respectively.Table IEpitope location of the anti-β3 and anti-αIIbmonoclonal antibodies (obtained by protein chemical and inmunochemical analysis), dissociation constants, and the number of antibody molecules bound per platelet (obtained from the isotherms of antibody binding to whole platelets at rest and after activation by ADP, TRAP, and AA)mAbEpitope locationKdMolecules× 10−3/plateletnRestADPTRAPAARestADPTRAPAAnmP6β3(302–692)aThis work.,bRefs. 7 and 8.45 ± 545 ± 446 ± 544 ± 360 ± 245 ± 248 ± 242 ± 25P23–7cAfter platelet incubation at 37 °C in 1 mmEDTA for 1 h.β3(1–150)aThis work.1843 ± 51480 ± 114P37β3(150–216)aThis work.9 ± 243 ± 110 ± 315 ± 445 ± 250 ± 251 ± 339 ± 48P40cAfter platelet incubation at 37 °C in 1 mmEDTA for 1 h.β3(150–216)aThis work.1237 ± 19083 ± 65P95–1β3(150–216)aThis work.19 ± 310 ± 29 ± 19 ± 250 ± 343 ± 245 ± 134 ± 46P95–2β3(150–216)aThis work.6 ± 17 ± 17 ± 120 ± 148 ± 333 ± 134 ± 139 ± 36P97β3(150–216)aThis work.9 ± 320 ± 311 ± 29 ± 255 ± 439 ± 335 ± 135 ± 36Mβ1αIIbL2-(4–24)bRefs. 7 and 8.381 ± 64332 ± 95625 ± 260105 ± 1759 ± 345 ± 453 ± 835 ± 15Mβ2αIIbL2-(1–92)aThis work.443 ± 44359 ± 100325 ± 85231 ± 8546 ± 239 ± 444 ± 335 ± 147Mβ3αIIbL2-(1–92)aThis work.680 ± 157722 ± 30365 ± 542 ± 44Mβ4αIIbL2-(1–92)aThis work.89 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2076006803,"In bacteria, coenzyme A is synthesized in five steps from pantothenate. The flavoprotein Dfp catalyzes the synthesis of the coenzyme A precursor 4′-phosphopantetheine in the presence of 4′-phosphopantothenate, cysteine, CTP, and Mg2+(Strauss, E., Kinsland, C., Ge, Y., McLafferty, F. W., and Begley, T. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 13513–13516). It has been shown that the NH2-terminal domain of Dfp has 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity (Kupke, T., Uebele, M., Schmid, D., Jung, G., Blaesse, M., and Steinbacher, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31838–31846). Here I demonstrate that the COOH-terminal CoaB domain of Dfp catalyzes the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine. The exchange of conserved amino acid residues within the CoaB domain revealed that the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine occurs in two half-reactions. Using the mutant protein His-CoaB N210D the putative acyl-cytidylate intermediate of 4′-phosphopantothenate was detectable. The same intermediate was detectable for the wild-type CoaB enzyme if cysteine was omitted in the reaction mixture. Exchange of the conserved Lys289 residue, which is part of the strictly conserved289KXKK292 motif of the CoaB domain, resulted in complete loss of activity with neither the acyl-cytidylate intermediate nor 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine being detectable. Gel filtration experiments indicated that CoaB forms dimers. Residues that are important for dimerization are conserved in CoaB proteins from eubacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes. In bacteria, coenzyme A is synthesized in five steps from pantothenate. The flavoprotein Dfp catalyzes the synthesis of the coenzyme A precursor 4′-phosphopantetheine in the presence of 4′-phosphopantothenate, cysteine, CTP, and Mg2+(Strauss, E., Kinsland, C., Ge, Y., McLafferty, F. W., and Begley, T. P. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 13513–13516). It has been shown that the NH2-terminal domain of Dfp has 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase activity (Kupke, T., Uebele, M., Schmid, D., Jung, G., Blaesse, M., and Steinbacher, S. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 31838–31846). Here I demonstrate that the COOH-terminal CoaB domain of Dfp catalyzes the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine. The exchange of conserved amino acid residues within the CoaB domain revealed that the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine occurs in two half-reactions. Using the mutant protein His-CoaB N210D the putative acyl-cytidylate intermediate of 4′-phosphopantothenate was detectable. The same intermediate was detectable for the wild-type CoaB enzyme if cysteine was omitted in the reaction mixture. Exchange of the conserved Lys289 residue, which is part of the strictly conserved289KXKK292 motif of the CoaB domain, resulted in complete loss of activity with neither the acyl-cytidylate intermediate nor 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine being detectable. Gel filtration experiments indicated that CoaB forms dimers. Residues that are important for dimerization are conserved in CoaB proteins from eubacteria, Archaea, and eukaryotes.

Brown showed that it is built from phosphorylated precursors (1Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 370-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). His initial studies were mainly continued by Y. Abiko, who characterized the various enzymatic activities of coenzyme A biosynthesis in a series of papers published in 1967 and 1968 (2Abiko Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1967; 61: 300-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Abiko Y. Suzuki T. Shimizu M. J. Biochem.

The conclusion of both pioneer works was that coenzyme A is synthesized in bacterial and in mammalian systems as follows (see Fig. 1). In the first step, pantothenate is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate, which is then converted by addition of cysteine to (R)-4′-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC,1 “coupling reaction”). PPC is then decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine, which is converted to coenzyme A in two further steps. Although the pathway for coenzyme A biosynthesis has been well established since the work of Brown and Abiko, purification and detailed characterization of the enzymes involved turned out to be very difficult. Since the coenzyme A biosynthetic genes are essential, their identification and cloning was also a great challenge. Starting with cloning of the pantothenate kinase gene (coaA) fromEscherichia coli in 1992 (7Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it took 10 years to identify all the genes of the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway in E. coli (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G.

In bacteria, the two-step conversion of 4′-phosphopantothenate to 4′-phosphopantetheine (peptide bond formation between 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine and then decarboxylation of the formed PPC) is catalyzed by the Dfp flavoproteins (Fig.1 and Refs. 8Kupke T.

Molecular characterization showed that the decarboxylase activity resides in the NH2-terminal CoaC domain of Dfp, indicating that the COOH-terminal (CoaB) domain is involved in synthesis of PPC (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). PPC decarboxylases bind the cofactor FMN, and during the last 2 years it has been shown that decarboxylation of PPC follows the mechanism “decarboxylation by initial oxidation” of the so-called LanD enzymes (8Kupke T.

In 2002 it was confirmed that the human PPC decarboxylase is also a flavoprotein (12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A., De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Earlier results classified bacterial and mammalian PPC decarboxylases as pyruvoyl-dependent enzymes (19Scandurra R. Barboni E. Granata F. Pensa B. Costa M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 49: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Scandurra R. Politi L. Santoro L. Consalvi V. FEBS Lett. 1987; 212: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 21Yang H. Abeles R.H. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4076-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), although there is no free amino group in the substrate. Begley et al. (22Begley T.P. Kinsland C. Strauss E. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 61: 157-171Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) first proposed a new mechanism for a pyruvoyl-dependent decarboxylation involving a N-S acyl shift to unmask the amino group, but later they confirmed that the flavoprotein Dfp catalyzes the decarboxylation of PPC as had been shown earlier by Kupke et al. (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 9Strauss E.

Until now the synthesis of PPC by Dfp has only been shown indirectly by measurement of released14CO2 froml-1-[14C]cysteine in the presence of 4′-phosphopantothenate, CTP, and Mg2+ (9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). BacterialPPC synthesis requires the cofactor CTP (1Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 370-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is converted during the reaction to CMP and inorganic pyrophosphate indicating the formation of an activated acyl-cytidylate as intermediate (Fig. 1 and Ref. 9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). HumanPPC synthetase uses ATP for the coupling reaction more efficiently than CTP. The synthesis of PPC was studied in this case by the release of inorganic pyrophosphate indicating that the activation mechanism of the human enzyme is comparable to that of bacterial enzymes (12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A., De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, Abiko et al. (5Abiko Y. Tomikawa M. Shimizu M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1968; 64: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) showed that the PPC synthetase from rat liver converts ATP to ADP and phosphate (and not to AMP and pyrophosphate). In this study, a molecular characterization of the COOH-terminal CoaC domain of Dfp was undertaken, and its ability to catalyze the synthesis of PPC is demonstrated. In contrast to previous studies onPPC synthetases (9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A., De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), the formation of PPC is directly shown. Conserved sequence motifs in the CoaC domain are investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, continuing the molecular characterization of the Dfp proteins (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 23Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These studies led to detection of the proposed activated acyl-cytidylate intermediate, 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP, and show that the synthesis ofPPC occurs in two half-reactions. Furthermore, it is shown that CoaB forms homodimers and that residues responsible for dimerization are conserved in CoaB (Dfp) proteins from all kingdoms of life. PCR amplifications were performed with Vent-DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The entire sequences of the coaA and coaB coding regions of the constructed plasmids were verified. Oligonucleotides were purchased from MWG Biotech. The 3′-part of thedfp gene encoding the COOH-terminal CoaB domain Ser181–Arg406 of Dfp was amplified by PCR and cloned into the single BamHI site of the expression vector pQE8 (Qiagen). For PCR amplification, the template pQE12 dfp(8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the primers (i) forward, 5′-GCGGTAGCGCATAGATCTCCCGTCAACGACC-3′ (the introduced BglII site is underlined) and (ii) reverse, 5′-GGTCATTACTGGATCTATCAACAGG-3′ were used. The reverse primer binds downstream of the BglII site of pQE12dfp. The amplified coaB gene was digested withBglII and cloned into pQE8 BamHI. The pQE8-derived plasmids were transformed into the expression strainE. coli M15 (pREP4) (Qiagen) by electroporation. The expression plasmid pQE8 coaB encodes an NH2-terminal His tag fusion protein of the CoaB protein (His-CoaB: MRGSHHHHHHG-Dfp Ser181–Arg406). All point mutations were first introduced into pQE12 dfp by using sequential PCR and appropriate mutagenesis primers as recently described (23Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 24Cormack B. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 8.5.1-8.5.9Google Scholar). Using the constructed mutant pQE12 dfpplasmids as templates, the mutant coaB genes were amplified and then cloned into pQE8 BamHI as described above for wtcoaB. Chromosomal DNA fromE. coli TB1 (New England Biolabs) was purified using the Qiagen Blood & Cell Culture DNA Mini kit. For cloning, thecoaA gene (7Song W.J. Jackowski S. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 6411-6417Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides (i) forward, 5′-GCTATGACCGCCGGATCCATGCTTATGAGTA-3′ and (ii) reverse, 5′-GAAAGGGGAGTATTGGATCCCCTGCAAATT-3′ as primers (introducedBamHI sites are underlined) and the purified chromosomal DNA as template. The amplified coaA gene was cloned into pQE8BamHI and then transformed in E. coli M15 (pREP4) as described above. The expression plasmid pQE8 coaA encodes an NH2-terminal His tag fusion protein of the CoaA protein (His-CoaA: MRGSHHHHHHGSML-CoaA). E. coli M15 (pREP4, pQE8) cells were grown in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml kanamycin in 0.5 liters of B-broth (10 g of casein hydrolysate 140 (Invitrogen), 5 g of yeast extract (Difco), 5 g of NaCl, 1 g of glucose, and 1 g of K2HPO4/liter, pH 7.3) in 2-liter shaker flasks. At A 578 = 0.4, the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and harvested 2 h after induction. The growth temperature was 37 °C. For purification of His-CoaA and His-CoaB proteins, 500 ml of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside-inducedE. coli M15 (pREP4, pQE8 coaA/coaB) cells were harvested and disrupted by sonication in 10 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0). 0.65–1.3 ml of the cleared lysates obtained by two centrifugation steps (each 20 min at 30,000 × g at 4 °C) were applied to Ni-NTA spin columns (Qiagen) equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmimidazole, 300 mm NaCl). The spin columns were then washed twice with 0.65 ml of column buffer. His-CoaA, His-CoaB, and mutant His-CoaB proteins were eluted with 0.16 ml of column buffer containing 250 mm instead of 10 mm imidazole. The Ni-NTA spin columns were centrifuged at room temperature at only 240 ×g to enable effective binding of the His tag proteins. For gel filtration, a 25-μl aliquot of the Ni-NTA eluate was subjected to a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated in running buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) at a flow rate of 40 μl/min. The Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column and the standard proteins used for calibration were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. For activity assays (see below), the Ni-NTA eluates were used. Since 4′-phosphopantothenate is not commercially available, it was synthesized enzymatically by adding His-CoaA, pantothenate, and ATP to the His-CoaB assay mixtures. Therefore, 0.8 ml of CoaB assay mixtures contained 5 mm pantothenate, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm ATP, 5 mm CTP, 10 mm cysteine hydrochloride, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, His-CoaA (∼10–15 μg), and either wt His-CoaB or mutant His-CoaB proteins in the range of 3–20 μg. After 45 min of incubation at 37 °C, the reaction mixtures were kept at −80 °C and then were successively separated by reversed phase chromatography with a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). Compounds were eluted with a linear gradient of 0–50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 5.8 ml with a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The absorbance was measured simultaneously at 214, 260, and 280 nm to enable identification of acyl-cytidylate intermediates. Proteins were separated using Tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (25Schägger H. Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10503) Google Scholar). Prestained protein molecular weight standards were obtained from New England Biolabs. Recently the alignment of the FMN binding CoaC domains of sequenced bacterial Dfp proteins was presented, and a PPC decarboxylase signature was defined (23Kupke T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27597-27604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here the sequence comparison is extended to the COOH-terminal domain of Dfp proteins (Fig.2 A). There are a lot of conserved sequence motifs within the CoaB domains with the210NXSSGK215 and the289KXKK292 motifs being the most noteworthy. In eukaryotes (and a few bacteria), the PPC decarboxylase and synthetase activities are not fused (12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A., De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19190-19196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Human and plant PPC decarboxylases share the bacterialPPC decarboxylase signature, whereas there is only marginal similarity of the eukaryotic PPC synthetases with the bacterial CoaB domains (12Daugherty M. Polanuyer B. Farrell M. Scholle M. Lykidis A., De Crécy-Lagard V. Osterman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21431-21439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 26Kupke T.

The sequence comparison shown is the basis for the site-directed mutagenesis studies of the CoaB domain presented below. Interestingly, it turned out that despite the low similarity of the PPC synthetase domains, residues that are proposed to be important for dimer formation of CoaB are conserved in CoaB proteins from eukaryotes and Archaea (Fig. 2 B and see below). It appears that the first Lys residue of the KXKK motif is also conserved in CoaB from eubacteria, eukaryotes, and Archaea (Fig. 2 B). However, the sequence similarity is very low, and biochemical studies are required to prove that the Lys residue has the same function in all CoaB proteins. CoaB and mutant coaB genes were expressed as His tag fusion proteins, purified from the corresponding E. coli clones by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) and additionally purified by gel filtration (Figs. 3 and4). Gel filtration was also used to determine the apparent molecular weight and to elucidate whether native His-CoaB forms monomers or homomultimers. A comparison with standard proteins revealed an apparent molecular mass of 42 kDa for native purified His-CoaB, indicating that His-CoaB forms homodimers (Fig. 4, molecular mass of His-CoaB is 26.1 kDa). Some of the analyzed mutant His-CoaB proteins (T194V, T198V, D203N, and A275V) showed a significantly increased elution volume that corresponds exactly to the molecular weight of monomeric His-CoaB. Also the elution volume of His-CoaB N210D is increased, but it appears that the mass of this protein is slightly increased compared with monomeric His-CoaB. In general, molecular weight determination of proteins by gel filtration is not precise, but the differences of the elution volumes between wt His-CoaB and mutant His-CoaB proteins clearly show that wt enzyme forms homodimers, while several of the mutants are monomeric. The residues that are important for dimerization of E. coliCoaB are conserved in eukaryotic PPC synthetases (Fig.2 B). It appears that residues Thr194–Asn210 of E. coli CoaB form a dimerization motif.Figure 4Gel filtration of mutant His-CoaB proteins. IMAC-purified His-CoaB proteins were separated by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column, and the elution was monitored by absorbance at 278 nm. The mutant proteins were analyzed under comparable conditions together with wild-type His-CoaB in two sets of experiments (A, His-CoaB wt, His-CoaB N210D, His-CoaB S212A, His-CoaB K215Q, His-CoaB D279N, His-CoaB D279E, His-CoaB K289Q, His-CoaB K291Q, and His-CoaB K292Q; B, His-CoaB wt, His-CoaB T194V, His-CoaB T198V, His-CoaB D203N, His-CoaB R206Q, His-CoaB A275S, His-CoaB A275V, His-CoaB A276V, His-CoaB D309N, and His-CoaB F327L). The determined elution volume of wild-type His-CoaB corresponds to a molecular mass of 42 kDa. The mutations T194V, T198V, D203N, N210D, and A275V (framed) led to significant changes of the elution volume. The gel filtration column used was calibrated with standard proteins to correlate the elution volume with molecular weight information as described recently (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G.

Mutations that prevent dimerization of CoaB do not prevent the formation of homododecameric Dfp (data not shown). Including the new results, I propose that within the Dfp homododecamers two PPC synthetase domains contact each other. Strausset al. (9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have shown that Dfp proteins are able to convert 4′-phosphopantothenate to 4′-phosphopantetheine when cysteine, dithiothreitol, CTP, and Mg2+ are present in the assay mixture, and they verified that Dfp catalyzes the decarboxylation ofPPC to 4′-phosphopantetheine. Considering the known biosynthetic pathway for coenzyme A, these results show that Dfp is a bifunctional enzyme and catalyzes the synthesis of PPC and subsequently the decarboxylation of PPC to 4′-phosphopantetheine. However, Strauss et al. (9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) could not directly detect PPC as the intermediate of the Dfp reaction. To analyze the biochemistry of the PPC synthetase activity of E. coli, it is necessary to separate PPC synthetase and PPC decarboxylase activities of Dfp. This can be achieved by disrupting the PPC decarboxylase activity or by separating the bifunctional Dfp protein into the two proposed domains, CoaB and CoaC. Both approaches were tried in the present study and were successful. Using the published HPLC method for the detection of PPC (8Kupke T. Uebele M. Schmid D. Jung G. Blaesse M. Steinbacher S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31838-31846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), I was able to show that the COOH-terminal CoaB domain of Dfp synthesizes PPC from 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). Biosynthesis of PPC was not only verified by comparison of the determined retention volume with that of synthetic PPC but also by electrospray ionization Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FTICR-MS) as described recently (8Kupke T.

Them/z value for PPC synthesized by CoaB was determined to be 403.09, which is in accordance with the theoretical mass of [PPC + H]+ = 403.0935 Da. Synthesis of PPC was also observed when Dfp C158S (26Kupke T. Hernández-Acosta P. Steinbacher S. Culiáñez-Macià F.A. J. Biol.

Recently it has been shown that the C158S mutation (Cys158 is within the amino-terminal CoaC domain of Dfp) inhibits the PPC decarboxylase activity (23Kupke T. J. Biol.

Biosynthesis of PPC was analyzed using the described HPLC-based assay. PPC was detectable when wt His-CoaB, His-CoaB S212A, His-CoaB K215Q, His-CoaB K291Q, or His-CoaB K292Q was used. However, no PPC was detectable when the mutant proteins His-CoaB N210D or His-CoaB K289Q were used for the assays. Interestingly, incubation with His-CoaB N210D led to a compound (labeled with an asterisk) with high absorbances at 260 and 280 nm (not shown). This compound was later identified to be the intermediate of the CoaB reaction (compare Fig.7). Synthesis of PPC could also be achieved with the mutant Dfp C158S protein, which is not able to decarboxylate PPC to 4′-phosphopantetheine. Synthetic PPC was used in the control experiment. The retention time of PPC was shifted to lower values compared with the data presented in Fig. 5. PPC already eluted during washing the column with H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (gradient started at 17 min). This is due to the increased number of applications of the column used and the large amounts of compounds applied to the column during the assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 5PPC synthetase activity of the CoaB domain. The synthesis of 4′-phosphopantothenoylcysteine from 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine was analyzed using an HPLC-based assay. 4′-Phosphopantothenate was synthesized in situ by incubation of pantothenate with ATP, Mg2+, and pantothenate kinase (His-CoaA). A, PPC is synthesized in the presence of pantothenic acid, Mg2+, ATP, CTP, cysteine, dithiothreitol, His-CoaA, and wt His-CoaB. B, when His-CoaB is omitted from the reaction mixture, no PPC is detectable. IMAC purification of the pantothenate kinase His-CoaA used was verified by SDS-PAGE as shown in the inset of B. C, no pantothenoylcysteine was detectable if pantothenic acid was incubated in the presence of CTP, cysteine, dithiothreitol, and Mg2+ with His-CoaB, indicating that only 4′-phosphopantothenate, and not pantothenate, is a substrate of CoaB.D, synthetic PPC was used as standard substance to evaluate the HPLC assays.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, the motifs 210NXSSGK215 and289KXKK292 of CoaB were investigated in more detail by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant proteins were purified and characterized by gel filtration (see above), and thePPC synthetase activity was analyzed (Fig. 6). Although the assay used is not suitable for the determination of kinetic parameters, it can be applied to identify amino acid residues that are crucial for activity. Introduction of the point mutations N210D and K289Q led to complete loss of PPC synthetase activity. However, His-CoaB N210D was able to form 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP, the proposed intermediate of PPC biosynthesis (Figs. 6 and7 and see below). The conclusion is thatPPC biosynthesis occurs in two half-reactions and that the residue Lys289 is important for formation of the activated acyl-cytidylate intermediate (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, it is reasonable to suggest that Lys289 may either be involved in binding the phosphate group of 4′-phosphopantothenate or in binding the phosphate groups of the cofactor CTP. The activity of the mutant His-CoaB N210D protein was analyzed in more detail (Fig. 7). Only very small amounts of PPC were synthesized by His-CoaB N210D. However, an intermediate with an increased retention time compared with PPC could be identified. This intermediate was only present in very small amounts, and repeated attempts to determine the molecular mass of this compound failed. Therefore, I tried to determine whether 4′-phosphopantothenate or cysteine is converted to this intermediate. The results obtained clearly show that phosphopantothenate, but not cysteine, is converted to the intermediate (Fig. 7). As expected, this intermediate could also be detected with wt His-CoaB when cysteine was omitted in the assay mixture (Fig. 7). Further characterization of the intermediate was possible by following the elution of the compound from the used C2/C18 column at various wavelengths. This revealed high absorbances of the compound at 260 nm (not shown) and 280 nm (Fig. 7). Pantothenate does not absorb in this UV range, and the determined ratio of the absorbances,A 280/A 260 = 2.0, showed that the intermediate is derived from CTP and not ATP. Taking all these data together and including the observation of Strauss et al. (9Strauss E. Kinsland C., Ge, Y. McLafferty F.W. Begley T.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13513-13516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) that CTP is converted to CMP and inorganic pyrophosphate during the Dfp reaction, I conclude that the detected compound is the proposed 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP intermediate (Fig. 1 B). If this intermediate is not attacked by cysteine, it will be present in an enzyme-bound form and will be released from the enzyme under acidic conditions as has been observed in the experiments shown. The conclusion is that the mutation N210D either impairs binding of cysteine or influences the nucleophilic attack on the intermediate by cysteine (Fig. 1). The experiments also indicate that formation of 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-CMP does not require a dimeric structure of CoaB since the N210D mutant is a monomer. The increased mass of purified His-CoaB N210D compared with the determined mass of monomeric His-CoaB may be explained by binding of the acyl-cytidylate. Pantothenate synthetase catalyzes the condensation of pantoate with β-alanine in an ATP-dependent way in two half-reactions via the pantoyl-adenylate intermediate (27Miyatake K. Nakano Y. Kitaoka S. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 62: 215-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 28Zheng R. Blanchard J.S. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12904-12912Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). β-Alanine is derived from aspartate by decarboxylation catalyzed by the pyruvoyl-dependent aspartate 1-decarboxylase (29van Poelje P.D.

Chem. 1979; 254: 8074-8082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to compare this pathway with the biosynthesis of 4′-phosphopantetheine catalyzed by the Dfp protein. Both synthetases, pantothenate synthetase and CoaB, are dimers. The catalysis of peptide bond formation is similar and depends on the formation of activated acyl-cytidylate or acyl-adenylate intermediates. However, the involved decarboxylation reactions are different. Aspartate is decarboxylated before formation of the peptide bond, whereas decarboxylation of cysteine is not observed. The cysteamine residue of 4′-phosphopantetheine is introduced by FMN-dependent decarboxylation of PPC by the NH2-terminal CoaC domain of Dfp. Recently it was shown that the structure of the NH2-terminal domain of pantothenate synthetase is very similar to class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases and that pantothenate synthetase belongs to the cytidylyltransferase superfamily (31von Delft F.

It will be interesting to learn more about the three-dimensional structures of Dfp and CoaB by x-ray diffraction methods to elucidate how CTP is bound by the enzyme and to gain more insights into the reaction mechanism. Dfp is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of 4′-phosphopantetheine in a multistep process from 4′-phosphopantothenate and cysteine. In the first step, 4′-phosphopantothenate is activated by reaction with CTP. The 4′-phosphopantothenoyl-cytidylate formed is attacked by cysteine, andPPC is synthesized. These reactions occur in the COOH-terminal CoaB domain of Dfp. The next step is the FMN-dependent oxidative decarboxylation of PPC to 4′-phosphopantothenoylaminoethenethiol, which is then reduced to 4′-phosphopantetheine (16Hernández-Acosta P. Schmid D.G.

The decarboxylation reaction is catalyzed by the NH2-terminal CoaC domain, and presently it is not known how CoaB and CoaC domains interact to synthesize 4′-phosphopantetheine most effectively."

The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)1 catalyzes the initial steps in the synthesis of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. For this reason, leukotriene synthesis is critically dependent on processes that modulate 5-LO activity. One such process is nuclear import of 5-LO. In leukocytes circulating in peripheral blood, 5-LO is found exclusively in the cytoplasm (2Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol.

In particular, our understanding of the regions on 5-LO that act as nuclear import sequences (NISs) is incomplete. Previously, Funk and colleagues (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) identified three candidate regions based on the abundance of the basic amino acids Arg or Lys. Partial mutagenesis of these basic regions (BR) indicated that none of these sites acted as an NIS (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A more complete study of one of these BRs, which matched the motif for bipartite NISs, led to the conclusion that this region, and in particular Arg651, was necessary for nuclear import of 5-LO (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, further analysis of Arg651 mutants of 5-LO indicated that these had limited enzymatic activity (9Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), suggesting that these mutants were misfolded and that this might be the basis for impaired nuclear import. Until now, candidate nuclear import regions on 5-LO have been identified solely on the presence of basic residues, which facilitate binding with importin proteins. In this study, additional structural and functional criteria were used. First, 5-LO from mouse, rat, and human leukocytes all show nuclear import (10Chen X.-S. Naumann T.A. Kurre U. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17993-17999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), but the related 12-LO and 15-LO do not (11Chen X.-S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As a result, the primary sequence structure of candidate NISs should be both unique to 5-LO and common across species. Second, to interact with importin proteins, both monopartite and bipartite NISs must conform to an appropriate secondary structure. Resolved crystal structures indicate that both the monopartite SV40 large T antigen NIS and the bipartite nucleoplasmin NIS must reside on random coil/loop structures to interact with importin α (12Fontes M.R. Teh T. Kobe B. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1183-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 13Conti E. Kuriyan J. Structure Fold.

Cell. 1998; 94: 193-204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Thus, candidate regions on 5-LO should have a random coil or loop secondary structure. Finally, Funk and colleagues (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) demonstrated that mutations that eliminated enzymatic function could also abolish nuclear import. This showed that import can be inhibited nonspecifically, by general changes in protein structure, as well as specifically, by eliminating NIS binding to importin. More importantly, it showed that enzymatic function may be used to distinguish specific and nonspecific effects of mutagenesis on import. This study applies these structural and functional criteria for NISs to 5-LO. Re-examination of the putative bipartite NIS shows that it fails to meet both structural and functional criteria and cannot be a true NIS. This contrasts with a novel region, spanning residues 518–530 on human 5-LO, that meets these new criteria and is both sufficient and necessary for nuclear import. Interestingly, we find that although this region functions as an NIS, at least one other NIS must also exist on 5-LO. Amino acid sequences were obtained from Swiss-Prot from the ExPaSy (Expert Protein Analysis System) proteomics server of the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. Primary accession numbers for proteins are: for 5-LOs, human P09917, mouse P48999, rat P12527, hamster P51399; for 15-LOs, rabbit P12630, human P16050; for human platelet-type 12-LO P18054. Alignment of protein sequences was performed using CLUSTALW (15Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54898) Google Scholar). Structural analysis utilized the resolved structures of rabbit 15-LO (Protein Data Bank identifier 1lox) and the theoretical model of the 5-LO catalytic region (16Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To construct a fusion peptide joining BR518 to green fluorescent protein (GFP), complementary oligonucleotides encoding Val514–Leu535 (VYGMRGRKSSGFPKSVKSREQL) were annealed and ligated to the BamHI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1. To construct GFP/BR/BR, two copies of the above mentioned oligonucleotides were ligated in tandem to theBamHI and HindIII sites of pEGFP-C1. Specific amino acids within the putative 5-LO NISs were substituted in the pEGFP-C1/5-LO template (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, two complementary primers (125 ng each) containing the desired mutation and 20 ng of template in 1× reaction buffer were denatured at 95 °C for 30 s and annealed at 55 °C for 30 s, and DNA synthesis was carried out byPfu polymerase at 68 °C for 14 min. This cycle was repeated 12–18 times, depending on the number of bases substituted, according to the manufacturer's directions. The methylated template was removed by incubation with 10 units of DpnI at 37 °C for 1 h. The mutation BR518a was R518Q/G519G/R520Q/K521Q, and BR518b was K527Q/S528S/V529V/K530Q. All substitutions and constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis (DNA Sequencing Core, University of Michigan). Oligonucleotides (the sequences of which are available upon request) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA) or Invitrogen. NIH 3T3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or Polyfect (Qiagen, Inc.) transfection reagents according to the manufacturer's specifications. Transient transfectants were evaluated microscopically, live or after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, 16–20 h after transfection. Comparable results were obtained when cells were examined as early as 9 h after transfection. As described previously (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), cells were disrupted by sonication on ice, and protein concentrations were determined by a modified Coomassie dye binding assay (Pierce). Samples containing 10 μg of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions and transferred to nitrocellulose. Membranes were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified human leukocyte 5-LO (a generous gift from Dr. J. Evans, Merck Frosst Centre for Therapeutic Research) (17Woods J.W. Evans J.F. Ethier D. Scott S. Vickers P.J. Hearn L. Charleson S. Heibein J.A. Singer I.I. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1935-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) or rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; titer 1:500) followed by peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection (Amersham Biosciences). To stimulate 5-LO activity, cells transfected with various 5-LO constructs were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in serum-free medium containing 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187 and 10 μmarachidonic acid. Immunoreactive leukotriene B4 in conditioned media was quantitated by enzyme immunoassay (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) according to the supplier's instructions. As an initial approach to quantitation, slides were fixed 16 h after transfection, and 100 positive cells were scored as to whether nuclear fluorescence was greater than, equal to, or less than cytosolic fluorescence. Care was taken to avoid damaged, dead, or autofluorescent cells. Results from at least three independent transfections per construct were used for statistical analysis. As a second approach, 100 individual cells per construct were scored for cytosolic and nuclear fluorescence intensity: using Adobe PhotoShop 5.5, grayscale digital images were adjusted to include the full black-to-white range, and representative gray values, from 0 (white) to 100 (black), were obtained for the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm. Cytoplasmic and nuclear values for each cell were summed to give total cellular fluorescence, and the percentage of fluorescence values for the nuclear compartment were calculated. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using p < 0.05 as indicative of statistical significance. Pairs of group means were analyzed using the Tukey-Kramer post test. As noted above, nuclear import of 5-LO is common across species but does not occur in other LOs. This suggested that the primary sequence should be strongly conserved in 5-LO from different species and should not be found in other LOs. The putative bipartite NIS, characterized as RKX 11RNKKK in human 5-LO (residues 638–655), is largely conserved across different species of 5-LO, although the terminal grouping, RNKKK, changes to RNKNK in rodent 5-LOs (Fig.1 A). In other LOs, only the initial arginine as well as the critical arginine (Arg651in human 5-LO) are conserved. By primary structure alone, this region would remain a reasonable candidate functional NIS. Interaction with importin requires that both simple and bipartite NISs have a coil or loop secondary structure. On 5-LOs and other LOs, almost the entire region corresponding to BR638 forms an α-helix (Fig. 1 B). This suggested that this region does not have an appropriate structure to mediate interaction with importin. One consequence of having the amino acids arranged in a helix is that the positively charged side groups of basic residues may not be oriented for accessibility to interact with importin. Most notably, the critical residue Arg651 projects inward with its side chain apparently interacting with the negatively charge side group of Asp473 (Fig. 1 C). Further examination of the 628–654 helix (Fig. 1 B) revealed that the majority of the residues that are conserved across different LOs (Fig. 1 A) are hydrophobic and oriented toward hydrophobic residues on the sister 470–489 helix (data not shown). This indicated that the interaction between Arg651 and Asp473 serves a critical role in maintaining the correct positioning of the two helices. These structural features indicated that mutation of Arg651stopped nuclear import not because it prevented interaction of 5-LO with importin but rather because it eliminated the key Arg651–Asp473 association. If so, then mutation of Asp473 should similarly stop nuclear import. Consistent with this, replacement of Asp473 with Gln, like the R651Q mutation, eliminated nuclear import of GFP/5-LO (Fig.2). Importantly, both the R651Q mutant and the D473Q mutant of GFP/5-LO were catalytically inactive, both when tested in intact 3T3 cells and when tested in cell-free assays (data not shown). This result was consistent with these residues serving critical structural functions. A novel basic region, beginning at Arg518 on human 5-LO, was identified after aligning numerous mammalian 5-, 12-, and 15-LOs simultaneously using CLUSTALW. Correct alignment was suggested by high levels of amino acid similarity on both sides of the region as well as alignment of the GFPXS core (Fig.3 A). This region, BR518, contained three clustered basic residues at one end (RGR/KK) and three at the other (KSI/VKSR), which were conserved across 5-LOs and not found in 12- or 15-LOs (Fig. 3 A). This region was found on a random coil of the catalytic domain of 5-LO (Fig.3 B). The presence of conserved glycine and proline residues, which can serve as “helix breakers,” also indicates that this region would retain a random coil structure. Since the region was conserved across different 5-LOs, not found on other LOs, and was on a coiled structural element, it met our primary and secondary structural criteria for a good candidate NIS. To determine whether this region was sufficient to mediate nuclear import, a sequence encoding the entire BR518 region was appended to GFP. As published previously (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), GFP alone was found to be equally distributed between the nucleus and cytoplasm of transfected 3T3 cells, presumably because its small size allowed free diffusion into and out of the nucleus of 3T3 cells. As shown in Fig.4, the GFP/5-LO fusion protein, as demonstrated previously (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), showed strong nuclear accumulation. Fusion of the BR518 peptide to GFP (GFP/BRpeptide) produced nuclear import that mimicked that of GFP/5-LO, although the small size should still allow free diffusion of the protein back out of the nucleus. Fusion of two sequential BR518 peptides to GFP (GFP/BR/BR) produced stronger nuclear import. To determine whether either part of the BR518 region was necessary for nuclear import, site-directed replacement of basic residues on GFP/5-LO was performed. The clusters, designated BR518a and BR518b, on either side of the Gly-Phe-Pro spacer were analyzed separately or together. Since the terminal arginine of BR518b is located on a helix (16Hemak J. Gale D. Brock T.G. J. Mol. Model. 2002; 8: 102-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that it might serve a structural function, BR518b was first examined without this residue. The mutation BR518a was R518Q/G519G/R520Q/K521Q and BR518b was K527Q/S528S/V529V/K530Q. Mutated proteins of the appropriate size were expressed in similar amounts as wild type GFP/5-LO in transfected 3T3 cells (Fig.5 A). This result was obtained using antibodies to either GFP (Fig. 5 A) or 5-LO (data not shown). Surprisingly, several distinct patterns of subcellular distribution of the mutants were observed in a given transfection: some cells showed clear nuclear accumulation of the expressed protein, other cells showed a balanced distribution, and others showed cytosolic accumulation (Fig. 5 B). This result was quantitated by scoring cells individually as having nuclear fluorescence greater than, equal to, or less than the cytosolic fluorescence. Representative images and numbers are given in Fig. 6. Although the majority (78%) of wild type GFP/5-LO cells had nuclear accumulation, a significant number (22%) had a balanced distribution. A balanced distribution of 5-LO, associated with nuclear envelope breakdown during mitosis, has been described (18Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and quantitated (9Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mutation at either the BR518a or the BR518b site reduced the number of cells with nuclear import and increased those with cytosolic fluorescence. Mutation at both sites appeared to be additive.Figure 6Quantitation of the distribution phenotypes observed with the different GFP/5-LO constructs. 3T3 cells were transfected with GFP/5-LO that was unmodified (wild type) or mutated in the BR518a (mBR 518 a), BR518b (mBR 518 b), or both regions (mBR 518 (a+b)). After 16 h, 100 positive cells were scored for nuclear accumulation (Nuc>Cyto), balanced (Nuc=Cyto), or cytosolic (Nuc<Cyto) distribution, and representative cells were imaged. Numbers indicate results from one experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Statistical analysis of results from multiple transfections showed that both the reduction of cells with nuclear import and the increase in cells with cytosolic fluorescence were statistically significant (Table I). This analysis also showed that mutation of both basic regions produced statistically greater changes in both distribution groups. No statistically significant change in the group showing balanced distribution was found for any mutation. Significantly, all mutants were functionally active, producing leukotriene B4 when stimulated with the calcium ionophoreA23187 in the presence of 10 μm arachidonic acid (TableI). The double mutant produced marginally less LTB4 than the single mutants or WT GFP/5-LO. These results indicated that mutation of the BR518(a+b) region significantly, but only partially, impaired nuclear import of 5-LO.Table IEffect of mutations in the BR518 region on subcellular distribution of GFP/5-LO in 3T3 cellsPlasmidNuclear > CytosolicNuclear = CytosolicNuclear < CytosolicActivityWild type80.8 (1.7)17.9 (2.3)1.3 (0.6)+++mBR518a64.4 (4.1)*21.7 (3.3)13.9 (1.3)*+++mBR518b69.3 (0.6)*18.8 (0.7)11.9 (1.0)*+++mBR518 (a + b)54.1 (3.1)***22.5 (1.5)23.4 (2.5)***++Cells were transfected, incubated for 16 h, and fixed. 100 cells/transfection were scored; results are reported as percent of cells with the given distribution of green fluorescence.

Activity was assessed as amount of leukotriene B4 produced by transfected cells, adjusted for protein expression, as measured by enzyme immunoassay. Since nuclear import was only partially eliminated by the BR518(a+b) mutation, it was possible that additional residues remained in this region to mediate import. For example, the terminal residue in this region, Arg532, might be important. Indeed, mutation of this residue, when combined with the BR518(a+b) mutation, completely eliminated nuclear import of 5-LO (Fig.7 A). However, mutation of Arg532 alone also greatly reduced nuclear import (Fig.7 B). Importantly, mutation of Arg532, either alone or with BR518(a+b), eliminated enzymatic activity (Table II). These results were reminiscent of our analysis of Arg651 (Figs. 1 and 2) in which Arg651 was found to interact with an acidic amino acid. Closer examination of Arg532 indicated that its side chain appears to be positioned between those of Asp490 and Asp496 (not shown). These results suggested that Arg532 serves a structural role and is not part of an NIS.Table IIEffect of mutation of Arg531 on the subcellular distribution of GFP/5-LO and GFP/5-LO mBR518 in 3T3 cellsPlasmidNuclear > CytosolicNuclear = CytosolicNuclear < CytosolicActivityWild type86.9 (0.9)11.7 (1.0)1.4 (0.5)+++R531Q10.0 (2.2)*32.2 (2.4)*57.7 (0.2)*−−−mBR518 (a + b)59.3 (3.0)*22.0 (1.8)*18.8 (1.3)*++mBR518 (a + b) + R531Q0.0 (0.0)***8.6 (1.1)91.4 (1.1)***−−−Cell preparation is as described in Table I; results are reported as percentage of cells with the given distribution of fluorescence.

Activity was assessed as amount of leukotriene B4 produced by transfected cells, adjusted for protein expression, as measured by enzyme immunoassay. The possibility that basic amino acids on the surface of 5-LO, close to BR518, might cooperate in import was examined. Surprisingly, a cluster of basic residues, recognized previously by Chen et al. (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) as BR128, is near BR518. This region, 128KQHRRK, was tested previously: the R131Q/R132Q mutant eliminated nuclear import but also was inactive, suggesting that these residues were structurally important. Indeed, Arg131 is oriented toward the center of 5-LO and is conserved across different LOs, supporting a structural role. However, Arg132 and Lys133 are oriented outward and are unique to the 5-LOs, suggesting that they might be relevant to nuclear import. Mutation of these two residues had no effect on import when compared with WT 5-LO (TableIII). Also, mutation of these residues, when combined with mutation of BR518(a+b), was without further effect. Finally, these substitutions had no effect on catalytic activity (Table III). These results demonstrated that the residues Arg132 and Lys133 are not involved in regulating nuclear import.Table IIIEffect of mutations in the BR128 region on the subcellular distribution of GFP/5-LO and GFP/5-LO mBR518 in 3T3 cellsPlasmidNuclear > CytosolicNuclear = CytosolicNuclear < CytosolicActivityWild type83.9 (1.9)15.3 (2.0)0.8 (0.3)+++mBR12880.6 (5.5)14.6 (2.7)4.9 (2.8)+++mBR518 (a + b)57.2 (2.7)21.7 (1.1)21.1 (2.0)++mBR518 (a + b) + mBR12863.5 (1.4)22.4 (3.0)14.1 (2.6)++Cell preparation is as described in Table I; results are reported as percentage of cells with the given distribution of fluorescence.

Open table in a new tab Cell preparation is as described in Table I; results are reported as percentage of cells with the given distribution of fluorescence. Mutations in BR128 were R132Q/K133Q. Data are means (S.E.) ofn = 5 experiments. Activity was assessed as amount of leukotriene B4 produced by transfected cells, adjusted for protein expression, as measured by enzyme immunoassay. Although the above analyses demonstrated that mutation of the BR518 site affected the subcellular distribution of 5-LO, they do not clearly define the nature of that effect. In particular, they did not clearly indicate whether the mutation simply reduced the efficiency of nuclear import or whether the mutation resulted in distinct subpopulations of cells. To address this question, nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence levels were quantitatively analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures” so that the percentage in each compartment in individual cells could be charted. By this analysis, it was found that there were (at least) two subpopulations exhibiting nuclear import of GFP/5-LO when expressed in 3T3 cells (Fig.8 A). A major peak, consistently found in multiple transfections, consisted of cells with ∼65% of total fluorescence in the nucleus (peak N 1). A shoulder, associated with 80–90% nuclear fluorescence, was also consistently observed (peak N 2). Mutation of BR518(a+b), as shown in Fig. 8 B, did not simply reduce the rate of nuclear import, which would have been manifested as a shift in peak position to the left. Instead, this mutation produced a new population with 35% nuclear fluorescence (Fig.8 B, peak C 1). It should be noted that these cells, with representative cells shown in Figs. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, had little or no nuclear import; the relatively high value of 35% nuclear fluorescence reflects the conservative scoring of this quantitative method. Offsetting this increase was a selective decrease in a subset of the cells with nuclear import. Although the N1 nuclear peak was slightly reduced, there was substantial reduction in the N2 peak. In general terms, these results indicated that mutation of BR518 reduced the capacity for the strong nuclear import that produced the N2 peak. The resulting protein was still capable of pronounced nuclear import in some cells, as evidenced by the persistent N1 peak. However, the resulting protein did not direct nuclear import in those cells comprising the C1 peak. The nuclear import of 5-LO has repeatedly been shown to be a mechanism for regulating the leukotriene synthetic capacity of leukocytes (2Brock T.G. McNish R.W. Bailie M.B. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8276-8280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 3Hsieh F.H. Lam B.K. Penrose J.F. Austen K.F. Boyce J.A. J. Exp.

Previous studies have provided evidence that BR638–655 is a bipartite NIS. More specifically, analysis by our group and others has found that Arg651 is absolutely critical for nuclear import (8Healy A.M. Peters-Golden M. Yao J.P. Brock T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29812-29818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence that, unlike other bipartite NISs, residues 638–654 reside on a structural α-helix and that Arg651 acts to link that structure to a neighboring helix, indicating that this region does not serve an NIS function. We have now for the first time identified a new region on 5-LO, involving residues 518–530 on human 5-LO, that meets a more rigorous set of criteria as a functional NIS. Specifically, this region 1) is conserved on other mammalian 5-LOs and is not found on 12- or 15-LOs, 2) forms a random coil secondary structure, 3) can, as a peptide, direct the import of GFP, and 4) retains enzymatic activity when site-directed mutation impairs nuclear import of the full-length protein. These results indicate that this region is a functional NIS on 5-LO. However, mutation of this region produces (at least) two distinct populations. The persistence of nuclear import in some cells, even when BR518 is intensively mutated, suggests that another NIS must exist on 5-LO. Our current understanding regarding 5-LO action includes acceptance of BR638–655 as a functional bipartite NIS (for example, see Ref. 19Lepley R.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 356: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The primary reason for this must be its strong similarity to the signature pattern of bipartite NISs, as indicated by its identification by such tools as PROSITE or MotifScan. However, this pattern has a high probability of occurrence in proteins, leading to false positives: about 4.2% of non-nuclear proteins have such patterns (20Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The central function of basic residues in an NIS is to interact with importins, which mediate the import process (21Chook Y.M. Blobel G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 703-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Structurally, the side chains of these critical residues must extend outward to facilitate this protein-protein interaction. However, structural analysis indicated that the critical residue Arg651 (on 5-LO) is conserved across different LOs and that its side chain is oriented inward. Also, this basic residue was found to interact with a conserved acidic residue, Asp473, on 5-LO. In this study, we found that replacement of either residue with an uncharged amino acid eliminated both nuclear import and enzymatic activity. These findings strongly indicate that this region is not an NIS. Such an analysis showed that, in addition to the presence of basic residues, structural criteria could be useful in identifying potential NISs. Also, the observation by Chen and Funk (11Chen X.-S. Funk C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 811-818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that 12-LOs and 15-LOs do not show nuclear import suggested that the 5-LO NIS should not be found on these closely related proteins. Using both primary and secondary structural information, we identified the BR518–530 segment as a potential NIS. Addition of a single copy of this peptide to GFP strongly directed nuclear import; two copies produced greater nuclear accumulation. Replacement of basic residues in this region of the GFP/5-LO fusion protein strongly impaired nuclear import. Significantly, these mutants retained their catalytic activity. These results indicate that this region is a functional NIS. Surprisingly, elimination of basic residues in BR518–530of 5-LO resulted in a protein that could be imported in some cells but not others within a given population of transfectants. This result was very different from the essentially total elimination of nuclear import observed when either Arg651 or Asp473 was replaced (Fig. 2) or when protein structure was intentionally disrupted (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the subpopulations of distributions observed in mBR518(a+b) 5-LO transfectants are visually striking. As shown in Fig. 8 B, they are quantifiably distinguishable. The subpopulation demonstrating unquestionable nuclear import (designated as Nuc>Cyto in Fig. 6and as N 1 in Fig. 8 B) can only mean that a functional NIS remains on this mutated 5-LO protein. A weak NIS was identified in the opposite end of the protein, in the N-terminal domain (7Chen X.-S. Zhang Y.-Y. Funk C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31237-31244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the absence of strong nuclear import in other cells in the same population (designated asNuc<Cyto in Fig. 6 and C 1 in Fig. 8 B) may indicate that the alternative NIS can be inactivated. Alternatively, the export process may be important in determining the subcellular distribution of this protein. It is possible that the export process may also be regulated, that peak N1 corresponds to inactivated export, and that peak C1 and/or the balanced distribution peak (at 50% nuclear fluorescence) corresponds to activated export. The conclusion that a second NIS, in addition to BR518, may exist and may be inactivated allows additional interpretation of the quantitative data for WT 5-LO, as shown in Fig. 8 A. Considering the import process alone, the greater nuclear fluorescence at peak N2 may reflect the action of two active NISs, whereas the lesser peak N1 may result from a single active NIS. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that neutralization of one NIS (BR518) reduces peak N2 more than N1 (Fig. 8 B). Alternatively, it is possible that, for WT 5-LO, the export process, when activated, may only be able to diminish nuclear import from N2 to N1. The nuclear import process is commonly regulated by phosphorylation (for review, see Ref. 22Sweitzer T.D. Love D.C. Hanover J.A. Curr. Top. Cell. Regul. 2000; 36: 77-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the metabolic activity of 5-LO can be stimulated by phosphorylation, by protein kinase C (23Hoffman T. Brando C. Lizzio E.F. Lee Y.L. Hansen M. Tripathi A.K. Taplits M. Puri J. Bonvini E. Abrahamsen T.G. Carter C.S. Reid G.K. Evans J. J.

Physiol. 1991; 261: L462-L471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a protein tyrosine kinase (25Glaser K. Sung A. Bauer J. Weichman B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 45: 711-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and by MAP kinase kinase (26Lepley R. Fitzpatrick F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 331: 141-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but these studies did not show direct phosphorylation of 5-LO. More recently, two groups have been able to show direct phosphorylation of 5-LO by a tyrosine kinase (27Lepley R. Muskardin D. Fitzpatrick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and by MAPKAP kinase 2 (28Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5261-5266Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Both groups also found that phosphorylation was necessary for translocation to the nucleus (27Lepley R. Muskardin D. Fitzpatrick F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6179-6184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 29Werz O. Klemm J. Samuelsson B. Radmark O. Blood. 2001; 97: 2487-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, it is not known whether any of these phosphorylation events might also modulate nuclear import of 5-LO. It has been shown previously that when the nuclear envelope breaks down during mitosis, the nuclear accumulation of 5-LO observed in cells in culture is lost (18Brock T.G. Paine R.I. Peters-Golden M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22059-22066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Izumi and colleagues (9Hanaka H. Shimizu T. Izumi T. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 505-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found that following the completion of mitosis and re-formation of the nuclear envelope, nuclear import was activated to regenerate the nuclear accumulation of 5-LO. This suggests that at least one of the NISs of 5-LO may be activated during the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In summary, we have used a combination of structural and functional criteria to re-examine the bipartite NIS-like domain of 5-LO and found that it is not a functional nuclear import sequence. However, we have identified a novel site on 5-LO that is conserved across species but is not found on other lipoxygenases, is distributed over a random coil of the catalytic domain, is sufficient to direct nuclear import of GFP, is necessary for normal import of 5-LO, and whose mutation does not abolish enzymatic activity. These results indicate that the 518–530 basic region of human 5-LO is a functional NIS. Surprisingly, our results indicate that at least one other NIS exists on 5-LO. We expect that a similar search strategy, based on the use of structural and functional criteria, will reveal the other NIS(s)."
https://openalex.org/W2083031150,"Recently, we reported that mutation A1529D in the domain (D) IV P-loop of the rat skeletal muscle Na+ channel μ1 (DIV-A1529D) enhanced entry to an inactivated state from which the channels recovered with an abnormally slow time constant on the order of ∼100 s. Transition to this “ultra-slow” inactivated state (USI) was substantially reduced by binding to the outer pore of a mutant μ-conotoxin GIIIA. This indicated that USI reflected a structural rearrangement of the outer channel vestibule and that binding to the pore of a peptide could stabilize the pore structure (Hilber, K., Sandtner, W., Kudlacek, O., Glaaser, I. W., Weisz, E., Kyle, J. W., French, R. J., Fozzard, H. A., Dudley, S. C., and Todt, H. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 27831–27839). Here, we tested the hypothesis that occlusion of the inner vestibule of the Na+ channel by the fast inactivation gate inhibits ultra-slow inactivation. Stabilization of the fast inactivated state (FI) by coexpression of the rat brain β1 subunit inXenopus oocytes significantly prolonged the time course of entry to the USI. A reduction in USI was also observed when the FI was stabilized in the absence of the β1 subunit, suggesting a causal relation between the occurrence of the FI and inhibition of USI. This finding was further confirmed in experiments where the FI was destabilized by introducing the mutations I1303Q/F1304Q/M1305Q. In DIV-A1529D + I1303Q/F1304Q/M1305Q channels, occurrence of USI was enhanced at strongly depolarized potentials and could not be prevented by coexpression of the β1 subunit. These results strongly suggest that FI inhibits USI in DIV-A1529D channels. Binding to the inner pore of the fast inactivation gate may stabilize the channel structure and thereby prevent USI. Some of the data have been published previously in abstract form (Hilber, K., Sandtner, W., Kudlacek, O., Singer, E., and Todt, H. (2002) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 27, program number 46.12).

Abstr. 27, program number 46.12). μ-conotoxin GIIIA domain Voltage-gated Na+ channels mediate the Na+conductance responsible for the rapidly rising phase of the action potential in nerve and muscle cells. Upon repolarization from brief depolarizations (<50 ms), Na+ channels recover from inactivation with a single kinetic phase whose time constant is on the order of a few milliseconds. After long depolarizations (seconds to minutes), recovery from inactivation proceeds through multiple kinetic phases whose time constants range over several orders of magnitude up to tens of seconds (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol.

Abstr. 2002; 27 (No. 46.12)Google Scholar). The most rapid phase of recovery is thought to correspond to the process of exit from the fast inactivated state, which occurs via intracellular occlusion of the ion-conducting pore by a cluster of hydrophobic amino acids in the loop that links DIII and DIV, the so-called “fast inactivation gate” of the Na+channel (3West J.W.

All other kinetic phases of recovery have been associated with a relatively poorly understood process called “slow inactivation.” The physiological importance of slow inactivation was established when defects in slow inactivation were found to underlie the pathophysiology of a number of heritable diseases of skeletal muscle (5Cannon S.C.

We recently demonstrated that replacement of alanine 1529 by aspartic acid in the DIV P-loop of the rat skeletal muscle Na+channel μ1 (DIV-A1529D) enhanced entry to an ultra-slow inactivated state, which is characterized by time constants of entry to and recovery from inactivation of ∼100 s (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). A similar type of recovery from inactivation in μ1 channels with slow time constants on the order of several tens of seconds was reported recently by other authors (e.g. Refs. 9Bendahhou S. Cummins T.R. Hahn A.F. Langlois S. Waxman S.G. Ptacek L.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 15Bendahou S. Cummins T.R. Griggs R.C., Fu, Y.H. Ptacek L.J. Ann. Neurol. 2001; 50: 417-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In DIV-A1529D channels, transition to this ultra-slow inactivated state was substantially reduced by binding to the outer pore of a mutant μ-CTX.1 This suggested that ultra-slow inactivation may reflect a structural rearrangement of the outer channel vestibule and that binding to the pore of a peptide can stabilize the pore structure (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol.

Although the structural determinants of fast inactivation are distinct from those of slow inactivation (e.g. Refs. 17Featherstone D.E. Richmond J.E. Ruben P.C. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3098-3109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholarand 18Vedantham V. Cannon S.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the various inactivation processes seem to be coupled. Fast inactivation inhibits the probability of slow inactivation (7Hayward L.J. Brown Jr., R.H. Cannon S.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1204-1219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 17Featherstone D.E. Richmond J.E. Ruben P.C. Biophys.

J. Gen. Physiol. 1977; 70: 567-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). Similarly, ultra-slow inactivation may as well be modulated by other types of inactivation. However, the effects of faster types of inactivation on ultra-slow inactivation have not yet been investigated. μ1 Na+ channels consist of a pore-forming α subunit and an auxiliary β1 subunit. Coexpression of β1 subunits with μ1 α subunits inXenopus oocytes modulates the gating properties of the channels (22Patton D.E. Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chang S.Y. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2581-2592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The most dramatic β1 effect is an increase in the rate of inactivation, which is reflected by an acceleration of the current decay after channel activation. β1 exerts its effects by stabilization of the fast inactivated state (e.g. Refs. 24Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar and 25Balser J.R. Nuss H.B. Romashko D.N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In the presence of β1, the channels favor a “fast-gating mode” in which they open only once or twice per depolarizing prepulse. In the absence of β1, the fast inactivated state is destabilized, and a “slow-gating mode” predominates that is reflected by bursts of channel openings (23Chang S.Y. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2581-2592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Patlak J.B. Ortiz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 87: 305-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 27Zhou J.Y. Potts J.F. Trimmer J.S. Agnew W.S. Sigworth F.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In a previous study (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we found that coexpression of the rat brain β1 subunit slowed entry of DIV-A1529D channels to the ultra-slow inactivated state during long-lasting depolarizations. This result and the fact that the β1 subunit stabilizes the fast inactivated state suggested that fast inactivation could inhibit ultra-slow inactivation. This hypothesis was investigated in the present study. Therefore, we explored the effects of stabilization and destabilization of the fast inactivated state on ultra-slow inactivation. We found strong evidence that fast inactivation inhibits entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state, possibly because binding to the inner pore of the fast inactivation gate stabilizes the channel structure. A detailed description of the experimental procedures is given in our previous work (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide-directed point mutation DIV-A1529D was introduced using four-primer PCR. An oligonucleotide containing the mutation was designed with a change in a silent restriction site to allow rapid identification of the mutant. A vector consisting of the μ1-coding sequence flanked by Xenopus globin 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions was provided as a gift by R. Moorman. This was used as the template for mutagenesis, and PCR fragments were isolated and subcloned to this template using directional ligations. Incorporation of the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the entire polymerized regions. The vector was linearized bySalI digestion and transcribed with SP6 DNA-dependent RNA polymerase using reagents from the mCAP RNA capping kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The rat brain β1 subunit of the Na+ channel was also subcloned into pAlterXG, and transcription was prepared fromBamH1-linearized template using SP6 RNA polymerase. I1303Q/F1304Q/M1305Q was made by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis and confirmed by sequencing the polymerized region. DIV-A1529D was introduced in this construct by cloning the SacII-KpnI fragment into the I1303Q/F1304Q/M1305Q construct. The presence of both mutations in the final plasmid was confirmed by restriction digests analyzing silent mutations introduced at the time of mutagenesis. Stage V and VI Xenopus oocytes were isolated from female frogs (NASCO, Ft. Atkinson, WI), washed with Ca2+-free solution (90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNaHPO4, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.6 with 1 n NaOH), and treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Sigma) for 1.5 h; follicular cell layers were manually removed. As judged from photometric measurements, ∼50–100 ng of cRNA was injected into each oocyte with a Drummond micro-injector (Broomall, PA). Either native or mutant α subunit cRNA alone or mixed with various concentrations of rat brain β1 subunit were injected. In the case of DIV-A1529D channels, the injected molar cRNA α/β1 ratio ranged from 100 to 0.07. Oocytes were incubated at 17 °C for 12 h to 3 days before examination. Recordings were made in the two-electrode voltage clamp configuration using a TEC 10CD clamp (npi electronic, Tamm, Germany). The clamp amplifier had a series compensation circuit. For accurate adjustment of the experimental temperature (20 ± 0.5 °C) an oocyte bath cooling system (HE 204, Dagan, Minneapolis, MN) was used. Oocytes were placed in recording chambers in which the bath flow rate was about 100 ml/h, and the bath level was adjusted so that the total bath volume was less than 500 μl. Electrodes were filled with 3m KCl and had resistances of less than 1 megaohm. Using pCLAMP6 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) software, data were acquired at 71.4 kHz after low-pass filtration at 2 kHz (−3 decibel). Curve fitting was performed using ORIGIN 5.0 (MicroCal Software, Inc., Northampton, MA). Recordings were made in a bathing solution that consisted of 90 mm NaCl, 2.5 mmKCl, 1 mm BaCl2, 1 mmMgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.2 with 1n NaOH. BaCl2 was used as a replacement for CaCl2 to minimize Ca2+-activated Cl− currents. If not otherwise specified, recovery from ultra-slow inactivation was tested with the following experimental protocol. From a holding potential of −120 mV, the channels were inactivated by a 300-s depolarizing voltage step. Thereafter, the potential was returned to −120 mV, and recovery from inactivation was monitored by repetitive 25-ms test pulses to −20 mV at 20-s intervals. The first test pulse was applied 3–10 ms after the prepulse to allow for settlement of the capacitive current transients. The time courses of recovery from ultra-slow inactivation of normalized peak inward currents were fit with the double exponential function, I2/I1=−A1exp(−t/τ1)−A2exp(−t/τ2)+CEquation 1 where I 2 is the peak inward Na+ current of the test pulse during recovery,I 1 is the peak inward Na+ current of a test pulse under fully available conditions, τ1 (always constrained to 10–12 s) and τ2 (always constrained to 100–150 s) are the time constants of distinct components of recovery,A 1 and A 2 are the respective amplitudes of these time constants, and C is the final level of recovery. A 2 was taken as a measure of the fraction of channels that recovered from ultra-slow inactivation (see Ref. 1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and will subsequently be referred to as “ultra-slow fraction.” In the case of the mutant μ1-I1303Q/F1304Q/M1305Q, which did not exhibit ultra-slow inactivation, recovery from slow inactivation was fit with the monoexponential function. I2/I1=−Aexp(−t/τ)+CEquation 2 The kinetics of the current decay after activation by a step depolarization was taken as a measure of the fraction of DIV-A1529D channels, which inactivated fast (time constants about 1 ms (“fast-gating channels”) or slow (time constants >10 ms (“slow-gating channels”)). We consider a large fraction of fast-gating channels to reflect a high degree of stabilization of the fast inactivated state (24Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar, 25Balser J.R. Nuss H.B. Romashko D.N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The current decay was analyzed using two different methods. First, the current decay after channel activation was fit by a bi-exponential function (Equation 1). The two different amplitudes (A 1 and A 2) were taken as a measure of the fraction of channels that gated either fast (A 1) or slow (A 2), respectively. If not otherwise specified, the channels were activated with the voltage step that elicited maximum current. For accurate comparison of the time constants of current decay in DIV-A1529D α-only and DIV-A1529D α + β1 channels, it was essential to precisely adjust the bath temperature to 20 °C (see above). The fraction of fast- and slow-gating channels has previously been estimated from macroscopic current records on the basis of bi-exponential fits to the time course of current decay after channel opening (28Cannon S.C. McClatchey A.I. Gusella J.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1993; 423: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Stevens E.B. Cox P.J. Shah B.S. Dixon A.K. Richardson P.J. Pinnock R.D. Lee K. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2001; 441: 481-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, we found that this fitting procedure frequently resulted in parameter estimates that were associated with substantial standard errors; also the initial setting of the fit parameters influenced the estimation of the final parameters. To eliminate this potential error source, we introduced a different method to analyze the current decay after channel opening. Second, the slow-gating mode is characterized by multiple channel reopening during depolarization, which underlies the slowing of macroscopic current decay (27Zhou J.Y. Potts J.F. Trimmer J.S. Agnew W.S. Sigworth F.J. Neuron. 1991; 7: 775-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Hence, the total amount of charge entry should be increased by multiple channel reopening. The integral area between the zero current line and the current decay from the current peak to the current 50 ms after the depolarizing voltage step was used to estimate the amount of total charge entry. Here, big integral values reflect slow current decay as well as a large fraction of slow-gating channels, whereas small integral values reflect rapid current decay and a large fraction of fast-gating channels. Such current-time integrals have previously been used as an indices of the total open channel probability after channel activation (25Balser J.R. Nuss H.B. Romashko D.N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 30Wang D.W. Nie L. George A.L.J. Bennett P.B. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 1700-1708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To allow a direct comparison of the current-time integrals between single oocytes, the peak of the current traces to be analyzed was always normalized to 1. Data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using two-tailed Student's t-tests. Ap < 0.05 was considered significant. Fig. 1 A shows the growth of inward currents through wild type μ1 channels with subsequent 25-ms test pulses at 20-s intervals. From a holding potential of −120 mV, the channels were first inactivated by a 300-s depolarizing prepulse to −50 mV. Recovery from inactivation after returning to −120 mV was monitored through repetitive test pulses to −20 mV (see “Experimental Procedures”). In wild type μ1 channels, about 80% of the current recovered within 20 s, whereas the small remaining fraction, about 20%, took several minutes to completely recover (“ultra-slow recovery,” see “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast to μ1 channels, mutant DIV-A1529D exhibited a large ultra-slow recovering component of inactivation (Fig.1 B). About 40% of the current recovered within 20 s, whereas the large remaining fraction, about 60%, took several minutes to completely recover. In a series of such experiments, the calculated fractions of channels recovering from ultra-slow inactivation were 0.22 ± 0.02 (n = 6) in μ1 channels and 0.60 ± 0.02 (n = 19) in DIV-A1529D (value for μ1taken from Hilber et al. (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)). Thus, significantly more channels recovered from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D than in μ1 channels. A more detailed investigation of ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels was carried out in a previous study (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). To investigate the relationship between fast inactivation and ultra-slow inactivation, we used different strategies to stabilize the fast inactivated state and tested the effects of these strategies on ultra-slow inactivation. In wild type μ1channels, coexpression of the β1 subunit stabilizes the fast inactivated state (e.g. Refs. 24Schreibmayer W. Frohnwieser B. Dascal N. Platzer D. Spreitzer B. Zechner R. Kallen R.G. Lester H.A. Receptors Channels. 1994; 2: 339-350PubMed Google Scholar and 25Balser J.R. Nuss H.B. Romashko D.N. Marban E. Tomaselli G.F. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 643-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here, we used coexpression of the β1 subunit to stabilize the fast inactivated state in DIV-A1529D channels to investigate the effects of fast inactivation on ultra-slow inactivation. First, we confirmed that the β1 subunit exhibited similar modulatory effects in DIV-A1529D channels as previously reported for wild type Na+ channels (22Patton D.E. Isom L.L. Catterall W.A. Goldin A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Chang S.Y. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys.

Science. 1992; 256: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). We compared the current decay in oocytes that were injected either with DIV-A1529D α-only cRNA or with DIV-A1529D α + rat brain β1 cRNA (molar α/β1 ratios ≤0.30). Fig.2 A shows typical Na+ current traces through wild type μ1α-only and μ1 α + β1 channels. It can be clearly seen that coexpression of the β1 subunit substantially accelerated the kinetics of current decay. A similar result was obtained with DIV-A1529D α-only and DIV-A1529D α + β1 channels (Fig. 2 B). A bi-exponential function (Equation 1) was fit to the decay currents, and the fractions of channels that inactivated with a fast and a slow time constant were calculated (see “Experimental Procedures”). The mean values of time constants (τ1, τ2) and amplitudes (A 1, A 2) ± S.E. of a series of such fits are given in TableI. The table shows that both τ1 and τ2 were similar in DIV-A1529D α-only and DIV-A1529D + β1 channels. In contrast, the amplitudes A 1 and A 2 that we used as a measure of the fraction of channels that inactivated with a fast (fast-gating channels) or a slow (slow-gating channels) time constant (see “Experimental Procedures”) were strongly dependent on the coexpression of the β1 subunit. In DIV-A1529D α-only injected oocytes only a small fraction of channels inactivated with a fast time constant. DIV-A1529D + β1 channels mainly inactivated with a fast time constant, but in all oocytes investigated, a small but discernable fraction of channels, about 0.07, inactivated with a slow time constant (Table I). Control experiments showed that an α/β1 ratio of 0.30 was sufficient to obtain a maximum β1 subunit effect on current decay. There was no significant rise in the fast decay fractions if the β1 subunit concentration was increased from an α/β1 ratio of 0.30 to 0.15. An additional increase to 0.07 in three oocytes also showed no effect. The respective fast decay fractions were 0.93 ± 0.01 (α/β1 ratio, 0.30;n = 4), 0.93 ± 0.01 (α/β1 ratio, 0.15; n = 4), and 0.92 ± 0.01 (α/β1 ratio, 0.07; n = 3).Table IParameters of bi-exponential current decay fits Equation 1) of DIV-A1529D α-only and DIV-A1529D α + β1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytesDIV-A1529Dτ1τ2Fast fraction (A 1)(ms)(ms)α-onlyMean1.212.60.13S.E.0.20.30.04n71414α + β1Mean1.513.50.931-aStatistically significant difference (p < 0.01, unpaired t test).S.E.0.10.40.01n111111The channels were activated from a holding potential of −120 mV with the voltage step, which elicited maximum current (≈ − 20 mV). τ1 and τ2 are the time constants of distinct components of recovery; A 1 is the amplitude that was used as a measure of the channel fraction, recovering with the time constant τ1 (fast fraction).

Chem. 1994; 269: 17649-17655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,23Chang S.Y. Satin J. Fozzard H.A. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2581-2592Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), coexpression of the β1 subunit dramatically increased the fraction of fast-gating DIV-A1529D channels, whereas the time constants themselves were not altered. Thus, coexpression of the β1 subunit exhibits similar effects on the gating properties of DIV-A1529D and μ1 channels, stabilizing the fast inactivated state in DIV-A1529D channels as well. In a previous study (1Hilber K. Sandtner W. Kudlacek O. Glaaser I.W. Weisz E. Kyle J.W. French R.J. Fozzard H.A. Dudley S.C. Todt H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27831-27839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) we investigated the effects of coexpression of the rat brain β1 subunit on ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D channels. We found that the β1subunit delayed entry to the ultra-slow inactivated state but did not alter entry voltage dependence. Fig. 3 shows the recovery of inward currents through DIV-A1529D + β1 channels with subsequent pulses at 20-s intervals after being inactivated by a 300-s (A) or a 1200-s (B) depolarizing prepulse to −50 mV. We found that the longer prepulse duration substantially delayed recovery from ultra-slow inactivation in DIV-A1529D + β1channels. A summary of the recovery curves of four such experiments is shown in the inset. Bi-exponential curve fits to the data points (solid lines) were used to estimate the fraction of DIV-A1529D + β1 channels, which had entered the ultra-slow inactivated state (see “Experimental Procedures”). This fraction was 0.37 ± 0.03 after a 300-s prepulse and 0.58 ± 0.03 after a 1200-s prepulse to −50 mV (n = 4). These fractions were statistically different (pai"
https://openalex.org/W2034399368,"We have mutated a conserved residue of the death domain of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), threonine 66. The substitution of Thr-66 with alanine or glutamate prevented spontaneous activation of NF-κB by overexpressed IRAK but enhanced IL-1-induced activation of the factor. Like the kinase-inactivating mutation, K239S, the T66A and T66E mutations interfered with the ability of IRAK to autophosphorylate and facilitated the interactions of IRAK with TRAF6 and with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, AcP. Wild-type IRAK constructs tagged with fluorescent proteins formed complexes that adopted a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm. The Thr-66 mutations prevented the formation of these complexes. Measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer among fluorescent constructs showed that the Thr-66 mutations abolished the capacity of IRAK to dimerize. In contrast, the K239S mutation did not inhibit dimerization of IRAK as evidenced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, even though microscopy showed that it prevented the formation of punctate complexes. Our results show that Thr-66 plays a crucial role in the ability of IRAK to form homodimers and that its kinase activity regulates its ability to form high molecular weight complexes. These properties in turn determine key aspects of the signaling function of IRAK. We have mutated a conserved residue of the death domain of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor-associated kinase (IRAK), threonine 66. The substitution of Thr-66 with alanine or glutamate prevented spontaneous activation of NF-κB by overexpressed IRAK but enhanced IL-1-induced activation of the factor. Like the kinase-inactivating mutation, K239S, the T66A and T66E mutations interfered with the ability of IRAK to autophosphorylate and facilitated the interactions of IRAK with TRAF6 and with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, AcP. Wild-type IRAK constructs tagged with fluorescent proteins formed complexes that adopted a punctate distribution in the cytoplasm. The Thr-66 mutations prevented the formation of these complexes. Measurements of fluorescence resonance energy transfer among fluorescent constructs showed that the Thr-66 mutations abolished the capacity of IRAK to dimerize. In contrast, the K239S mutation did not inhibit dimerization of IRAK as evidenced by fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements, even though microscopy showed that it prevented the formation of punctate complexes. Our results show that Thr-66 plays a crucial role in the ability of IRAK to form homodimers and that its kinase activity regulates its ability to form high molecular weight complexes. These properties in turn determine key aspects of the signaling function of IRAK. interleukin IL-1 receptor accessory protein type I IL-1 receptor IL-1RI-associated protein kinases fluorescence resonance energy transfer tumor necrosis factor TNF receptor-associated factor transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 enhanced green fluorescent protein cyan fluorescent protein yellow fluorescent protein All of the biological effects of interleukin 1 (IL-1)1 depend upon its binding to the type I IL-1 receptor, IL-1RI (1Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The receptor is the prototypic member of a diverse family of conserved proteins generally involved in host defense (2O'Neill L.A. Greene C.

The binding of IL-1 to IL-1RI initiates the formation of a complex that includes IL-1RI, AcP, the adapter protein MyD88, and the IL-1RI-associated protein kinases (IRAKs).

Subsequent events involve the phosphorylation of IRAK by itself and by IRAK-4, its dissociation from the IL-1R1 complex, its ubiquitination, and its association with two membrane-bound proteins, the TGF-β-activated kinase (TAK1)-binding protein 2 (TAB2) and TRAF6, a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of adapter proteins (8Muzio M., Ni, J.

The roles of the two IRAK homologues, IRAK-2 and IRAK-M, are less well understood than the roles of IRAK and IRAK-4. Like IRAK, they associate with the IL1-R1 complex (8Muzio M., Ni, J. Feng P.

IRAK undergoes autophosphorylation shortly after stimulation of cells by IL-1, indicating that its catalytic activity is modulated during IL-1 signal transduction (11Yamin T.T. Miller D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21540-21547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). However, a point mutation of lysine 239 that completely abolished its catalytic activity did not interfere with its ability to activate NF-κB when expressed at high levels in transfected cells, suggesting that the protein kinase activity may not play an important role in signaling (4Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W., Li, S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 9Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad.

The death domain is a protein interaction domain, first defined as a conserved motif in the cytoplasmic domains of Fas and the type I TNF receptor (24Itoh N. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10932-10937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and has since been found in proteins of diverse cellular functions including MyD88 (25Hofmann K. Tschopp J. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 26Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The death domains of IRAKs mediate their recruitment to the IL-1R1 complex by associating with the death domain of MyD88 (4Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W., Li, S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 8Muzio M., Ni, J. Feng P. Dixit V.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (988) Google Scholar). They may also be involved in associations between IRAK molecules. This may be the reason why deletion of its death domain prevents overexpressed IRAK from spontaneously autophosphorylating, associating with TRAF6, and activating NF-κB (13Qian Y. Commane M. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Li X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41661-41667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 17Cooke E.L. Uings I.J. Xia C.L. Woo P. Ray K.P.

A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). We have investigated the functional roles of two conserved residues in the death domain of IRAK, Thr-66 and Trp-73. We have found that threonine 66 played a crucial role in the ability of IRAK to form homo-oligomeric complexes, a property that appears to regulate many aspects of IRAK function. Our results support a model in which the signaling activity of IRAK is regulated by both autophosphorylation and self-assembly. Cells lines (COS-1 and NIH 3T3) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). The FLAG-tagged TRAF6 and AcP cDNA constructs, the IRAK expression construct, and the NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter plasmid (pNF-κBluc) have been described elsewhere (27Burns K. Martinon F.

Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). IRAK mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the IRAK expression construct with the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). The wild-type IRAK sequence was excised from a pBluescript construct (28Volpe F. Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) withSalI and SacII restriction sites. It was ligated into the same sites of the expression vectors pEGFP-C1, pEYFP-C1, or pECFP-C1 (CLONTECH) downstream of sequences encoding the enhanced green (EGFP), yellow (YFP), or cyan (CFP) variants of Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein, respectively. The mutant IRAK cDNAs were transferred into pBluescript using EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites and then excised from it with the flanking SalI andSacII sites and ligated into pEYFP-C1 or pECFP-C1 similar to wild-type IRAK. Sequencing of the constructs confirmed that they encoded in-frame fusions of wild-type or mutant IRAK to the carboxyl termini of EGFP, YFP, or CFP. The full-length IRAK-2 coding sequence was amplified using primers of sequences GAATTCGTCGACATGGCCTGCTACATCTACCAGC and CTCGAGCCGCGGTTATGTAACATCCTGGGGAGGC, designed to introduceSalI and SacII restriction sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively. These restriction sites were used in cloning IRAK-2 into pEGFP-C1 and pECFP-C1. IRAK-M cDNA was amplified from human peripheral blood monocyte mRNA using oligonucleotides of sequences, 5′-GGAATTCGGCGCACACGCTGCTGTTCGACCTGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATCCCAGGAAAAATTTGGAGGAACAGCAGG-3′, and cloned into the VSV-pCRIII vector (29Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The CFP-IRAK-M construct was then made by excision of the IRAK-M coding sequence using flankingXhoI sites and cloning it into the XhoI site of pECFP-C1. Sequencing showed that the insert was in the sense orientation in the clone used experimentally. This construct encodes a fusion protein consisting of YFP joined to carboxyl end of CFP by a 15-residue linker of sequence SGLRSRAQADPPVAT. It was given to us by Dr. F. Carlotti. COS-1 cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates and transfected the next day with 1 μg of pNF-κBluc, 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase (27Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L., Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), and varying amounts of expression constructs. Total DNA was kept constant by the addition of empty vector. The cells were harvested and lysed 2 days later (7Cao Z. Henzel W.J. Gao X. Science. 1996; 271: 1128-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed as described previously (27Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L., Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Luciferase readings were normalized to β-galactosidase values. COS-1 cells were seeded (5 × 104/well) in four-well chambered coverglass (NalgeNunc) and transfected the following day with 2 μg of plasmid. Images were acquired with a Molecular Dynamics confocal scanning microscope equipped with a krypton/argon ion laser and controlled by a Silicon Graphics work station. Fluorescence excitation was performed with the 488-nm line of the laser. Fluorescence was collected through a 530 ± 15-nm bandpass filter. Images were obtained with a ×100 Plan Apo Immersion lens fitted on a Nikon Diaphot microscope. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in chambered coverglass as above and transfected the next day with expression plasmids for CFP- and YFP-labeled proteins (0.5 μg each). Images were recorded 24 h later with a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope equipped with a mercury arc lamp and a 10-bit digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu). Control of the camera and quantitative analysis of images were performed with OpenLab software (Image Processing and Vision Co. Ltd). Images of CFP and YFP fluorescence were acquired using the XF114 (excitation 440 nm, emission = 480 nm) and XF104 (excitation 500 nm, emission 545 nm) filter sets, respectively (Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT). FRET was detected with a custom-made filter set (excitation 440 nm, emission 535 nm), also from Omega Optical. Emission intensities were measured on the cytoplasms of individual cells. Each measurement was corrected by subtraction of background fluorescence determined from an extracellular region of the same image. FRET measurements were then corrected by subtraction of the direct emissions from donor and acceptor. These were calculated from the CFP and YFP measurements using correction factors determined in calibration tests done on cells expressing CFP and YFP (individually and in co-transfections) as well as the CFP-YFP construct. The FRET intensity measurements were normalized to CFP fluorescence (30Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells were seeded at 3 × 106 cells/10-cm dish and transfected on the following day. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (28Volpe F. Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 29Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) with 4.4 μg of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and protein G conjugated to Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The beads were then washed three times in lysis buffer without glycerol, resuspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and heated at 100 °C for 1 min. A 20-μl aliquot was separated on SDS Tris-HCl gels containing a gradient of 4–20% polyacrylamide (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-IRAK (28Volpe F. Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) at a 1:5000 dilution or anti-FLAG antibodies (1 μg/ml). HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories, and chemiluminescent reagents were from Pierce Warriner. Death domains consist of six α-helices packed into a cylindrical structure (31Huang B. Eberstadt M. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 384: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 32Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). By analyzing the sequences of several death domains and the crystal structures of the death domains of theDrosophila proteins Pelle and Tube (32Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), we identified two conserved residues that may play important roles in IRAK function (Fig.1). The most conserved residue is a tryptophan located near the carboxyl end of the fourth α-helix of most death domains, at position 73 of the IRAK sequence (Fig. 1). In the type I TNF receptor, the tryptophan is essential for cytotoxic signaling (33Tartaglia L.A. Ayres T.M. Wong G.H. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1993; 74: 845-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar). The crystal structures indicate that it is part of the hydrophobic core of the domain (26Feinstein E. Kimchi A. Wallach D. Boldin M. Varfolomeev E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 342-344Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar,32Xiao T. Towb P. Wasserman S.A. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1999; 99: 545-555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Also of interest is a threonine or serine that is specifically conserved in the IRAK family and in several other proteins such as Tube, MyD88, and the NF-κB family members, p100 and p105. It is located at the amino-terminal end of the fourth helix and corresponds to Thr-66 of IRAK, Ser-83 of Pelle, or Ser-110 of Tube (Fig. 1). An analysis of the crystallographic data with RasMol (34Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2323) Google Scholar) shows that Ser-83 and Ser-110 are not exposed at the surface of the Pelle and Tube death domains. Instead, they are hydrogen-bonded to a conserved residue of the first α-helix, Asp-50 of Pelle and Asp-49 of Tube. This finding strongly suggests that the homologous residue of IRAK, Asp-35, is hydrogen-bonded to Thr-66 and that this links together the fourth and first helices. In view of the locations of Trp-73 and Thr-66 at opposite ends of the fourth α-helix, we reasoned that mutating each residue would enable us to destabilize independently the packing of α-helices at either end of the death domain of IRAK and produce qualitatively distinct structural effects. In particular, replacing Thr-66 by a negatively charged residue should have a strong effect by creating electrostatic repulsion between Glu-66 and Asp-35. To investigate the role of death domain-mediated interactions in IRAK function, we mutated Trp-73 to alanine and Thr-66 to either alanine or glutamate. We assessed the effects of the mutations on several parameters of IRAK function and compared them to those of the kinase-inactivating mutation, K239S. The activation of NF-κB is a key component of cellular responses to IL-1. Thus, we monitored the effects of the mutations on the NF-κB-stimulating activity of IRAK in cells transfected with the promoter/reporter construct, pNF-κBluc (Fig.2 A). As previously reported (19Wesche H. Gao X., Li, X. Kirschning C.J. Stark G.R. Cao Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19403-19410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), wild-type IRAK stimulated NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner in the absence of IL-1. Cells transfected with 0.5 μg of an IRAK expression construct produced ∼20 times more luciferase than control cells (Fig. 2 A). In agreement with published results (4Wesche H. Henzel W.J. Shillinglaw W., Li, S. Cao Z. Immunity. 1997; 7: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (922) Google Scholar, 9Li S. Strelow A. Fontana E.J. Wesche H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 2001; 98: 4461-4465Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we also found that the kinase-suppressing mutation, K239S, did not interfere with this effect of IRAK (data not shown). In contrast, both of the T66A and W73A mutations strongly reduced the ability of IRAK to spontaneously activate NF-κB. In cells transfected with 0.5 μg of each mutant construct, the increase in reporter expression relative to controls was ∼5-fold (Fig. 2 A). Immunobloting of the cell lysates with the anti-IRAK antibody (28Volpe F. Clatworthy J. Kaptein A. Maschera B. Griffin A.M. Ray K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 41-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that the wild-type and mutants proteins were present at similar levels and migrated as intact proteins (data not shown). Thus, the failure of the mutants to spontaneously activate NF-κB was not caused by an enhanced rate of proteolysis. The effect of the mutations on responses to IL-1 was then examined. In the absence of any expression construct, IL-1 caused a 1.9-fold increase in reporter activity (Fig. 2, B–D). In cells expressing large amounts of IRAK, IL-1 caused only a very small increase in reporter activity, presumably because the NF-κB pool had already been almost completely activated by IRAK alone (Fig.2 B). In contrast, IL-1 increased reporter activity more effectively in cells expressing IRAK-(T66A) than in control cells (Fig. 2 C). The cytokine-induced increase in reporter activity was 3.4-fold for cells transfected with 0.05 μg of IRAK-(T66A), significantly higher than the 1.9-fold increase observed in its absence (p = 0.009). Unlike T66A, the T66E mutation did not increase the basal expression of the reporter in the absence of IL-1 (Fig. 2 D). Nonetheless, like IRAK-(T66A), IRAK-(T66E) amplified the response to IL-1 (Fig.2 D). The strongest amplification was observed with cells transfected with 0.25 μg of construct, which responded to IL-1 by a 3.0-fold increase in luciferase expression (p = 0.03). The IRAK-(W73A) mutant also appeared to amplify the response to IL-1 in some experiments, but the effect was weaker than that of the Thr-66 mutations and was not statistically significant (p = 0.10, data not shown). These results indicated that unlike wild-type IRAK, IRAK-(T66A) and IRAK-(T66E) were regulated by the activated IL-1 receptor in transfected cells. Because the IRAK death domain mediates the association of IRAK with itself or with other proteins, we analyzed the effects of Trp-73 and Thr-66 mutants on the localization and oligomerization of IRAK. To do this in living cells, we made constructs in which the amino end of IRAK or of its mutants was fused to EGFP, YFP, or CFP variants of A. victoria green fluorescent protein. To ascertain whether or not the fluorescent moieties interfered with the activity of IRAK, we compared the ability of the fluorescent constructs and of the corresponding unlabeled proteins to activate NF-κB. The level of activation induced by the fluorescent and non-fluorescent versions were not significantly different, indicating that fusion of the amino-terminal end of IRAK to a fluorescent protein did not alter its signaling function (data not shown). Confocal fluorescence microscopy of live COS-1 cells expressing low amounts of EGFP-IRAK showed that it adopted a punctate distribution throughout the cytoplasm and was excluded from the nucleus (Fig.3 A). This indicated that most or all of the fluorescent IRAK existed in discrete high molecular weight complexes. Higher levels of expression resulted in the accumulation of IRAK particles in very large patches (Fig.3 B). Low intensity imaging showed the patches to be composed of multiple copies of the complexes observed at low expression levels (data not shown). An analysis of high resolution images of cells expressing EGFP-IRAK with the Sobel edge detection algorithm showed that the fluorescent particles had an elongated shape (Fig. 3 C). Their widths were smaller than the optical resolution (0.2 μm), whereas their lengths appeared to vary between 0.2 and 1 μm (Fig. 3 C). This variation may result from random orientation of the particles relative to the image plane, rather than from true heterogeneity. A quantitative analysis of the fluorescence intensities of the particles in cells covering a 10-fold range in expression level showed that the average number of fluorescent molecules that they contained increased with expression once a threshold had been reached, suggesting that there is a concentration-driven assembly process within the cell (Fig.3 D). The YFP-IRAK-(W73A) fusion protein adopted the same punctate distribution as EGFP-IRAK (Fig.4 A). In contrast, YFP-IRAK-(T66A), YFP-IRAK-(T66E), and YFP-IRAK-(K239S) were all uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 4,B–D). This indicated that the formation of the high molecular weight IRAK complexes required both the presence of Thr-66 in the death domain and the catalytic activity of IRAK. We then examined the ability of mutant IRAK proteins to self-associate in live transfected cells by measuring FRET between pairs of wild-type or mutant IRAK proteins labeled with CFP and YFP. The technique provides a sensitive way of detecting direct interactions between fluorescent fusion proteins (30Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar). Co-expression of CFP-IRAK and YFP-IRAK constructs resulted in a FRET signal, indicating that the technique could detect the self-association of IRAK. The signal was significantly reduced in control experiments in which a non-fluorescent IRAK protein was co-expressed with the CFP- and YFP-tagged versions (data not shown). This finding confirmed that the FRET signal was the result of specific and saturable interactions. Co-expre"

In the nervous system of the marine molluskAplysia, there are only two major PKC isoforms, the calcium-activated PKC Apl I and the calcium-independent PKC Apl II, and both PKCs are persistently activated during intermediate memory. We monitored the PDK-dependent phosphorylation of PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II using phosphopeptide antibodies. During persistent activation of PKCs in Aplysia neurons, there is a significant increase in the amount of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II in the particulate fraction but no increase in the amount of PKC Apl I phosphorylated by PDK. PDK phosphorylation of PKCs was not sensitive to inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC, or expression of a kinase-inactive PDK. Localization of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II using immunocytochemistry revealed an enrichment of phosphorylated PKC Apl II at the plasma membrane. These data suggest that increased PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II is important for persistent kinase activation.

Kandel E.R. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 425-435Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following behavioral sensitization, or prolonged treatment of ganglia with serotonin (5-HT), the kinase activity in the particulate fraction of both Ca2+-activated conventional PKC Apl I and Ca2+-independent novel PKC Apl II is increased (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Persistent PKC activity is required for the maintenance of synaptic facilitation under some conditions (4Sutton M.A. Carew T.J. Neuron. 2000; 26: 219-231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mechanisms for the persistent activation of the PKCs are not well defined. Both initial PKC activation and protein translation are required for persistent activation of the PKCs (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are differences in the persistent activation of the two isoforms. The increase in PKC Apl II activity appears to be mainly because of autonomous activation of the kinase, whereas the increase in PKC Apl I appears to be mainly due to increased levels of regulated PKC Apl I on the membrane (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There is increased phosphorylation of PKC Apl I at a conserved autophosphorylation site during intermediate memory; however, the phosphorylated kinase is located exclusively in the cytoplasm and presumably does not contribute to the increase in particulate kinase activity (5Nakhost A. Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylation of PKC has been postulated to underlie persistent activation of PKCs during vertebrate learning models (6Sweatt J.D. Atkins C.M. Johnson J. English J.D. Roberson E.D.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). All PKCs require phosphorylation at the activation loop site by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK) for full catalytic activity (10Toker A. Newton A.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 185-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Ca2+-activated PKCs are phosphorylated by PDK soon after translation (11Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr.

Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). After PDK-dependent phosphorylation, Ca2+-activated PKCs undergo two major autophosphorylations that are required for the stability and folding of the enzyme, a process termed maturation (9Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28495-28498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar). Once these sites are phosphorylated, the PDK site can become de-phosphorylated without affecting the stability of the enzyme (12Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Because PDK docks at a C-terminal site that is no longer easily accessible in the mature enzyme, classical PKCs are not easily re-phosphorylated (14Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, whereas overexpression of PDK or PDK dominant-negatives affect the proportion of PKC found in the mature fraction, it does not affect the amount of mature PKC phosphorylated at the PDK site (12Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), presumably due to the lack of re-phosphorylation. PDK phosphorylation of novel PKCs has also been examined, although a detailed model for their phosphorylation has not been proposed. In contrast to Ca2+-activated PKCs (13Sonnenburg E.D. Gao T. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45289-45297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), PDK phosphorylation of PKCδ is regulated both by PKC autophosphorylation and by PI 3-kinase activity (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Regulation of phosphorylation of other kinases by PDK appears to be dependent on substrate conformation and subcellular localization as opposed to activation of PDK itself (16Belham C., Wu, S. Avruch J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R93-R96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17Alessi D.R. Kozlowski M.T. Weng Q.P. Morrice N. Avruch J. Curr.

PDK has an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that binds phosphoinositides including phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) (19Alessi D.R.

We have cloned PDK from Aplysia, and both the kinase domain and the PH domain are highly homologous to both vertebrate and invertebrate PDKs, suggesting that this is a PDK orthologue (23Khan A. Pepio A.M. Sossin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 382-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the role of PDK in the regulation of PKC inAplysia, we raised phosphopeptide antibodies to the PDK site in the classical PKC Apl I and the novel PKC Apl II. We then used the antibodies to characterize PDK phosphorylation of PKCs in theAplysia nervous system. Our results demonstrate differences in PDK regulation of classical and novel PKCs in the nervous system and suggest an important role for PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II during intermediate facilitation. A. californica(50–250 g) were obtained from Marine Specimens Unlimited at Pacific Palisades, CA, and were maintained in an aquarium for at least 3 days before experimentation. The animals were first placed in a bath of isotonic MgCl2/artificial seawater (1:1, v/v) and then anesthetized by injection of isotonic MgCl2. Pleural and pedal ganglia were isolated from the animal and pinned to silicone plastic in ice-cold dissecting medium (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 24Eisenstadt M. Goldman J.E. Kandel E.R. Koike H. Koester J. Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3371-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ganglia were then desheathed in order to facilitate penetration of pharmacological agents and incubated in resting medium (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 24Eisenstadt M. Goldman J.E. Kandel E.R. Koike H. Koester J. Schwartz J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 3371-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) for 3 h at 15 °C to minimize effects of dissection. In some experiments bag cell clusters were isolated from abdominal ganglia and treated in a similar fashion. Peptides containing the conserved PDK site in PKC Apl I and Apl II (Fig. 1) with the serine converted to phosphoserine were synthesized (Quality Controlled Biochemicals, Hopkington, MA). The peptides were conjugated to bovine serum albumin maleimide (Pierce) via the endogenous cysteine and injected into rabbits three times at 4-week intervals. In order to reduce the fraction of antibody that might recognize the non-phosphorylated peptide, the serum from animals was passed over an affinity column of the non-phosphorylated form of the immunizing peptide coupled to Sulfolink (Pierce). This process was repeated twice. After each passage, specifically retained antibodies were eluted from the column. The final flow through was then passed over an affinity column of the immunizing phosphopeptide coupled to Sulfolink, and retained antibodies were eluted and concentrated in a Centriplus-10. Antibodies to total PKC Apl I, total PKC Apl II, and PDK have been described (23Khan A. Pepio A.M. Sossin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 382-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High titer stocks of baculovirus encoding PDK, PDK (K-N), PKC Apl I, PKC Apl II, and PKC Apl II K-R (23Khan A. Pepio A.M. Sossin W.S. J.

Castellucci V.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used at a multiplicity of infection of 5 for each virus. Supernatant and membrane fractionation was as described (27Manseau F. Fan X. Hueftlem T. Sossin W.S. Castellucci V.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The GST-PDK and GST-PDK K-N constructs have been described (23Khan A. Pepio A.M. Sossin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 382-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed these constructs in bacteria and purified the GST fusion proteins on glutathione beads. The beads were then incubated with supernatants of Sf9 cell extracts either infected with baculovirus encoding PKC Apl I or PKC Apl II. The beads were incubated overnight and then washed three times with PBS. The beads were then eluted with sample buffer and separated on SDS gels. For experiments in ganglia, 250 μg of soluble nervous system extract (5Nakhost A. Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was incubated for 4 h with beads and then washed three times with homogenization buffer before elution of the beads with sample buffer. The fusion protein used to generate non-phosphorylated PKC Apl I was made by inserting a BamHI fragment of PKC Apl I into pMALC (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) cut with BamHI. The fusion protein starts with the sequence GSLSF from the hinge region and includes the native C-terminal tail. The fusion protein used to generate non-phosphorylated PKC Apl II was made by first cutting out a fragment encoding the catalytic fragment from PKC Apl II with NheI and EcoRI. The ends of this fragment were filled in with Klenow and ligated to the pGEX3.1 vector that had been cut with EcoRI and the ends filled in with Klenow. The sequence of PKC Apl II starts with ASNEH and includes the native C-terminal tail. The PDK and PDK (K-N) constructs used to make baculovirus have been described (23Khan A. Pepio A.M. Sossin W.S. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 382-391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To generate an expression construct for Aplysia neurons we cut out PDK (K-N) from the BB4 vector with Xho and Kpn and inserted it into the GFP-PKC Apl II C2 pNEX-3 vector (27Manseau F. Fan X. Hueftlem T. Sossin W.S. Castellucci V.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cut with Xho andKpn. This replaced the C2 domain of PKC with the PDK sequence to generate an enhanced GFP-PDK fusion protein starting with SRPGG from Aplysia PDK. This removes the first 130 amino acids of Aplysia PDK; this sequence is not conserved over evolution and does not contain any region of the kinase or PH domain. The protocol for inducing intermediate facilitation was identical to that described previously (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sossin W.S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Autonomous kinase activity on the membranes was measured as described (3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations were done as described (25Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots were performed as described (28Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Yanow S.K. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29469-29474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with the antibody to phosphorylated PKC Apl II at 1 μg/ml, the antibody to phosphorylated PKC Apl I at 1 μg/ml, the antibody to total PKC Apl I at 2.5 μg/ml, and the antibody to total PKC Apl II at 1 μg/ml. The phosphopeptide antibodies were pre-blocked with the non-phosphorylated peptide at a molar ratio of 50:1. Goat anti-rabbit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Pierce) was used at 0.5 μg/ml. Results were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance Plus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoblots were scanned, and analysis was performed using the public domain NIH Image program (developed at the National Institutes of Health and available on the Internet at rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). We calibrated our data with the uncalibrated OD feature of NIH image that transforms the data using the formula (y = log10(255/(255 − x))), where x is the pixel value (0–254). Control experiments demonstrated that after this calibration, values were linear with respect to amount of protein over a wide range of values. For each blot probed with both phosphopeptide-specific and total antibodies a phospho-ratio was calculated (immunoreactivity of anti-phosphopeptide antibody compared with immunoreactivity of total antibody). This ratio, although not comparable between different blots, was useful for determining differences in phospho-ratio between supernatant and pellet or between treatments. When examining treatments (e.g. 5-HT, Bis, etc.), the percentage change was calculated (((experimental phospho-ratio − control phospho-ratio)/control phospho-ratio)·100). When comparing supernatant to pellet a simple ratio was calculated (pellet phospho-ratio/supernatant phospho-ratio). Statistical tests involved paired two-tailed Student's ttests between control and experimental conditions or when appropriate unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests. To determine whether the phospho-ratio for pellet/supernatant was different from 1, a one-sample Student's t test was performed. To correlate phospho-ratio and autonomous activity, for each blot/kinase assay the maximum value for the phospho-ratio or autonomous activity was set to 1, and other values were calculated relative to the maximum value. This allows comparison of multiple experiments on the same axis. The protocol was identical to that described previously (27Manseau F. Fan X. Hueftlem T. Sossin W.S. Castellucci V.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modification. Cells were plated on poly-l-lysine plates with 20% hemolymph to increase process outgrowth. Cells were left for 3–5 days to allow adequate expression before fixation. Cultures were rinsed with artificial seawater and then fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS with 30% sucrose. Cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS with 30% sucrose for 10 min and washed 3 times with PBS. Free aldehydes were quenched with a 15-min incubation in 50 mmammonium chloride in PBS. Nonspecific antibody binding was inhibited by incubating with a blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.5% Triton X-100, in PBS) for 1 h. Cultures were incubated overnight with the primary antibody. For the chicken/rabbit PKC co-staining, 1:600 chicken anti-PKC and 1:1000 rabbit anti-PKC in blocking solution was used. The cultures were washed 4 times for 10 min with PBS and were then incubated with secondary antibody in blocking solution (1:150 CY2 anti-chicken and 1:400 CY3 anti-rabbit) for 1–2 h. For all other experiments, the rabbit phosphopeptide antibody was preabsorbed using the nonphosphorylated form of the peptide at 1 μg/μl for 30 min prior to use and then was added to the cultures in a 1:475 dilution in blocking solution. Cultures were washed 4 times for 10 min each in PBS and then incubated with secondary antibody in blocking solution (1:400 CY3 anti-rabbit and 1:200 CY5 anti-chicken) for 1–2 h. Finally, the cells were washed 4 times for 10 min with PBS, and the coverslips were mounted onto slides, using Mowiol as the mounting medium. Cultures were viewed on a Zeiss LSM 510 with Axiovert 200M inverted microscope. All quantitation was done on LSM 510 software. The mean pixel intensity of boxed plasma membrane areas (2–3/cell) and boxed cytoplasmic areas (2–3/cell) were quantitated. Aplysia neurons have highly infolded membranes due to their large size, and thus even in a confocal section (∼15 μm) the plasma membrane is not well defined. We used a box (∼1–2 μm wide) as a rough definition of plasma membrane-associated area. Efforts were made to use confocal images for quantitation from the mid-point of cells for standardizing between different cells. Occasionally, pigment granules could be seen in the sensory neuron cell bodies that were visible using the secondary antibody used for the total PKC Apl II antibody (CY5). Areas including these granules were not used in the quantitation. For each cell the average pixel intensity was calculated for cytosol and membrane areas for both total and anti-phosphopeptide antibodies. A phospho-ratio was then calculated for supernatant and membrane, and then the membrane/cytosol phosphate ratio for each cell was calculated. To examine the effect of cells injected with GFP-PDK (K-N), we compared the average of the mean cytosolic intensity, the mean membrane intensity, and the phospho-ratio for the expressing cells and non-expressing cells on the same coverslip to calculate an effect of GFP-PDK (K-N) for each experiment. The threonine that is phosphorylated by PDK in vertebrate PKCs is well conserved in the Aplysia PKCs (Fig.1 A). We thus raised antibodies to phosphopeptides containing phosphothreonine in this position for both PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II. We biased the peptides used for immunization to the divergent region N-terminal of the PDK site in order to make antibodies that are specific for individual PKC isoforms and that do not recognize other PDK-phosphorylated proteins (Fig.1 A). The resulting antibodies were highly specific for PKC recognizing single bands from nervous system extracts that co-migrated with the bands recognized by our well characterized antibodies to total PKC Apl I or PKC Apl II (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sossin W.S. Diaz A.R. Schwartz J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5763-5768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). To evaluate the specificity of the antibodies for phosphorylated PKC, we blotted bacterially expressed PKC catalytic domain as a control because there is no PDK in bacteria, and thus the bacterially expressed PKC will not be phosphorylated at the PDK site. This demonstrated that the antibodies are highly specific for phosphorylated PKCs as they do not react with PKC expressed in bacteria (Fig. 1 B). The bands recognized by the phosphopeptide antibodies are solely due to immunoreactivity to PKC as they can be completely immunoprecipitated by antibodies to total PKC (Fig.1 C). Phosphorylation at the PDK site is not due to autophosphorylation, because a kinase-inactive PKC (27Manseau F. Fan X. Hueftlem T. Sossin W.S. Castellucci V.F. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1247-1256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was well phosphorylated at the PDK site when expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig.1 D). However, the overall level of phosphorylation at the PDK site in the kinase-inactive PKC was less than that for the wild-type kinase expressed in Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 D). This decrease may be due to increased de-phosphorylation of the kinase inactive PKC Apl II. Indeed, phosphorylation at the PDK site was much more sensitive to phosphatases in the homogenization buffer for the kinase-inactive PKC Apl II K-R than for wild-type PKC Apl II (Fig.1 E; quantitated in Fig. 1 F). This is consistent with previous evidence from classical PKCs that PKC autophosphorylation is required to cause a conformational change that protects the PDK site from de-phosphorylation (11Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In many cases PDK binds to its substrates. To evaluate whether PDK could bind to PKC Apl II, we first examined whether GST-PDK could pull down Sf9 cell-expressed PKCs. PKC Apl II was pulled down by the GST-PDK fusion protein but was not pulled down by GST alone (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the PKC phosphorylated at the PDK site was not bound as well as unphosphorylated PKC (Fig. 2 A, quantitated in Fig. 2 B). Similar results have been observed for PKCβII where PDK immunoprecipitated de-phosphorylated PKC better than phosphorylated PKC (14Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). One explanation for this result is that PDK binds to the C-terminal region of PKCs and that this binding site is not accessible in the mature folded form of the kinase (14Gao T. Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19588-19596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, a higher proportion of PKC Apl II that was unphosphorylated might be in an immature, unfolded state and so more likely to have its C-terminal region accessible for binding to PDK. Interestingly, when we repeated these experiments using endogenous PKC Apl II from the nervous system, the proportion of phosphorylated and total PKC Apl II bound to GST-PDK was similar (Fig. 2 C, quantitated in Fig. 2 D). This may be due to the much lower proportion of immature unfolded kinase in the mature nervous system, compared with when PKC Apl II is overexpressed in the baculovirus system. The mechanism underlying persistent activation of PKCs is not known, but increased phosphorylation of PKCs by PDK is one possibility. We thus examined whether PDK phosphorylation of PKCs was modulated during the persistent activation of the PKCs stimulated by prolonged treatment with the facilitating transmitter, 5-HT (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, there was a significant increase in the percentage of PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site in the pellet fraction 2 h following a 90-min treatment of Aplysia ganglia with 5-HT (Fig. 3, A and B;p < 0.01). There was no change in the percentage of soluble PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site or in the percentage of soluble or particulate PKC Apl I phosphorylated at the PDK site (Fig. 3, A and B). As observed previously (2Sossin W.S. Sacktor T.C. Schwartz J.H. Learn. Mem. 1994; 1: 189-202PubMed Google Scholar), there was a significant increase in the percentage of PKC Apl I in the particulate fraction (Fig. 3, A and C;p < 0.02). Although there was no significant difference in the percentage of total PKC Apl II in the particulate fraction, the percentage of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II in the particulate fraction did increase (Fig. 3, A andC). In control ganglia, PKC Apl II that was not phosphorylated by PDK was mainly in the pellet fraction (i.e. the ratio of PDK phosphorylation was higher in the supernatant) (Fig. 3 D). After 5-HT treatment, however, there was a shift in this ratio toward PDK phosphorylation in the pellet (Fig. 3, C andD). In contrast, PKC Apl I had approximately equal phosphorylation at the PDK site in supernatant and pellet before and after 5-HT treatment (Fig. 3, C and D). Autonomous kinase activity is also increased by 5-HT during intermediate facilitation, and this activity derives from PKC Apl II (3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a separate series of experiments, we determined both the ratio of phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the PDK site and autonomous kinase activity from the pellets of ganglia treated with 5-HT (Fig.4). There was a very good positive correlation between the relative levels of autonomous activity and the relative phospho-ratio (r 2 = 0.58,p < 0.01, n = 16). This result suggests a relationship between PDK phosphorylation and autonomous activity of PKC Apl II. To explore mechanisms that regulate the ability of PDK to phosphorylate PKC in the Aplysia nervous system, we examined whether PDK phosphorylation of PKC was regulated by either PKC activity or by PI 3-kinase activity as has been noted for Ca2+-independent PKCs in vertebrates (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Neither inhibitors of PKC nor PI 3-kinase affected the level of phosphorylation at the PDK site (Fig. 5). Inhibitors of PKC phosphorylation did lead to an increased level of PKC on the membrane for both PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II consistent with PKC activity being required for the release of PKC from the particulate fraction (5Nakhost A. Dyer J.R. Pepio A.M. Fan X. Sossin W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28944-28949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar,29Feng X. Becker K.P. Stribling S.D. Peters K.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17024-17034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 30Feng X. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26870-26874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5, A and B). We also examined whether insulin, which increases the activity and amount of PKC Apl II on membranes of bag cell neurons in a wortmannin-sensitive manner (31Sossin W.S. Chen C.S. Toker A. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 220-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), led to increases in PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II. No significant changes were seen in the levels of PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site after insulin treatment (12 ± 20%; change in phospho-ratio of pellet fraction by insulin, n = 7, S.E.,p > 0.5, two-tailed Student's t test). The antibodies to phosphorylated PKC also worked well in immunocytochemistry of cultured Aplysia neurons. To compare the localization of phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated PKC, we raised an antibody to total PKC Apl II in chickens. This antibody had similar specificity as the previously generated rabbit antibody raised to the same epitope and was indistinguishable in immunocytochemistry (Fig. 6, A and B). By using the chicken antibody, we were able to label PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site and total PKC Apl II in the same cells. Comparing the two staining patterns revealed a significant increase in the relative immunoreactivity of phospho-PKC Apl II on or near the plasma membrane of cell bodies (see Fig. 6, C andD; quantitated in Fig. 6 G). No difference between the antibodies was seen in axons, varicosities, or growth cones (Fig.6, E and F). To determine whether we could control phosphorylation of PKC by PDKs using a dominant-negative strategy, we examined the ratio of staining for phospho-PKC and total PKC in neurons that were injected with a plasmid encoding a kinase-inactive PDK. The PDK was N-terminally tagged with GFP to monitor its level of expression. There was no significant change in the ratio of PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II to total PKC Apl II in the cytoplasm or membrane-associated regions between cells expressing or not expressing the catalytically inactive PDK (Fig.7). Thus, at the levels of expression we can attain in neurons, kinase-inactive PDK does not appear to act as a dominant-negative to block PKC phosphorylation by PDK. We generated phosphopeptide antibodies to the conserved PDK site in PKC Apl I and PKC Apl II. These antibodies are specific for PKCs phosphorylated at the PDK site as they do not recognize PKCs expressed in bacteria (where no PDK-like activity is present). Furthermore, the bands recognized by the phosphopeptide antibodies can be completely immunoprecipitated by other antibodies to PKC. The major result from this study is that phosphorylation at the PDK site of PKC Apl II is increased after prolonged 5-HT treatment and is correlated with autonomous PKC Apl II activity. In contrast, the increased activation of PKC Apl I seen at this time is not correlated with increased phosphorylation at the PDK site. We also localized PDK-phosphorylated PKC Apl II using immunocytochemistry and documented an enrichment of phosphorylated PKC Apl II at or near the plasma membrane. Phosphorylation of Ca2+-independent or novel PKCs at the PDK site appears to be more regulated than that of conventional PKCs.In vitro phosphorylation of the novel PKCδ by PDK requires PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and phorbol esters (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar), whereas in vitro phosphorylation of Ca2+-activated PKCs does not (12Dutil E.M. Toker A. Newton A.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1366-1375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Initial phosphorylation of PKCδ in vitro may resemble re-phosphorylation of conventional PKCs because PKCδ is partially active when expressed in bacteria even though the PDK site is not phosphorylated (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Thus, PKCδ can partially fold even in the absence of PDK phosphorylation (32Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). PKC Apl II resembles PKCε more than PKCδ; however, there has been little characterization of PKCε phosphorylation by PDK. In contrast to PKCδ, there is a high basal level of PKC Apl II phosphorylation at the PDK site, and this basal level was not sensitive to PI 3-kinase inhibitors or PKC inhibitors. Thus, it is possible that phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the PDK site may more closely resemble the constitutive phosphorylation of conventional PKCs (15Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). An important caveat is that we are examining PKC in primary nervous system tissue where there is probably considerable activation of most signal transduction pathways during the period of time before we gain experimental control of the ganglia. Thus, our results show that continued presence of phosphorylation of PKC at the PDK site does not require PI 3-kinase or PKC activity, but our results do not address how the initial phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the PDK site is regulated in the nervous system. PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II does appear to be more regulated than PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl I. First, PKC Apl II that is not phosphorylated at the PDK site has a distinct subcellular localization. By using biochemical techniques, it is enriched in the pellet fraction (Fig. 3 D), and by using immunocytochemical techniques, it is partially excluded from the plasma membrane (Fig. 6). These results suggest that either de-phosphorylation of PKC Apl II at the PDK site affects PKC localization or that a substantial pool of endogenous PKC Apl II is not phosphorylated at the PDK site during maturation. This appears distinct from PKC Apl I where PKC Apl I is not differentially found in the pellet based on its phosphorylation at the PDK site (Fig.3 D). Second, there is increased phosphorylation of PKC Apl II but not PKC Apl I in the pellet fraction during intermediate facilitation (Fig. 3 B). There was no significant change in levels of total PKC Apl II in the pellet, suggesting that this increase was due to increased phosphorylation of the PDK site. The mechanisms that regulate this phosphorylation are unclear. Notably, a percentage of particulate PKC Apl II is autonomously active at this time (3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and phosphorylation at the PDK site may be enhanced by the absence of a pseudosubstrate in the active loop. This idea is supported by the strong correlation between autonomous kinase activity and the percentage of PKC phosphorylated at the PDK site (Fig. 4). At this point it is not clear if the increased PDK phosphorylation is important in causing autonomous activation of the kinase, or a consequence of the autonomous activation. Unfortunately, because the kinase-dead PDK did not act as a dominant-negative and because there are no specific inhibitors of PDK, we cannot at this time determine whether PDK is required for activation of PKC during intermediate facilitation. By using immunocytochemistry we found that PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site is enriched near or on the plasma membrane. This suggests that the non-phosphorylated pool of PKC is excluded from the plasma membrane. This is apparently inconsistent with our finding that there is a pool of particulate PKC that is not phosphorylated (Fig.3 D). The particulate pool of PKC not phosphorylated at the PDK site may be associated with the cytoskeleton or an internal membrane fraction and thus may be measured in our immunocytochemical measurements as cytosolic. Indeed, a large percentage of particulate PKC Apl II in Aplysia is Triton-insoluble (33Nakhost A. Forscher P. Sossin W.S. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 1221-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Whereas PDK phosphorylation of PKCs has been well studied in vitro and in cell lines, this is the first characterization of PDK phosphorylation in neurons. There were important differences in the PDK phosphorylation of the classical PKC Apl I and the novel PKC Apl II inAplysia neurons. These differences could be explained by postulating that classical PKCs are only phosphorylated at the PDK site during initial formation of the kinase, whereas novel PKCs may be regulated by re-phosphorylation of this site during the kinase life cycle. Phorbol esters stimulate de-phosphorylation of classical PKCs that directly leads to degradation of the kinase (34Hansra G. Bornancin F. Whelan R. Hemmings B.A. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32785-32788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast, novel PKCs may be de-phosphorylated and stored as an inactive pool of enzyme that can be re-activated at a later time. Indeed, novel PKCs are less down-regulated by phorbol esters in many cell types (35Burry R.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 36Rybin V.O. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1994; 74: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 37Liu K. Hsiung S. Adlersberg M. Sacktor T. Gershon M.D. Tamir H. J.

Govoni S. Trabucchi M. Wetsel W.C. Battaini F. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 214: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), including Aplysia neurons (40Sossin W.S. Schwartz J.H. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 24: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) This is also the first time PDK phosphorylation has been imaged by immunocytochemistry. The relative increase in staining at membranes for PKC Apl II phosphorylated at the PDK site would be consistent with increased PDK phosphorylation of activated PKC. PDK phosphorylation of PKC Apl II may play a pivotal role in its activation during intermediate facilitation. The activation of PKC Apl II at this time requires translation (3Sossin W.S. Learn. Mem. 1997; 3: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Understanding what regulates PDK phosphorylation should provide clues to the important proteins whose translation needs to be regulated to persistently activate PKC Apl II during intermediate facilitation.
