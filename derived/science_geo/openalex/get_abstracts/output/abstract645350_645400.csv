https://openalex.org/W2999877325,"For the past 150 years, the prevailing view of the local Interstellar Medium (ISM) was based on a peculiarity known as the Gould's Belt, an expanding ring of young stars, gas, and dust, tilted about 20$^\circ$ to the Galactic plane. Still, the physical relation between local gas clouds has remained practically unknown because the distance accuracy to clouds is of the same order or larger than their sizes. With the advent of large photometric surveys and the Gaia satellite astrometric survey this situation has changed. Here we report the 3-D structure of all local cloud complexes. We find a narrow and coherent 2.7 kpc arrangement of dense gas in the Solar neighborhood that contains many of the clouds thought to be associated with the Gould Belt. This finding is inconsistent with the notion that these clouds are part of a ring, disputing the Gould Belt model. The new structure comprises the majority of nearby star-forming regions, has an aspect ratio of about 1:20, and contains about 3 million solar masses of gas. Remarkably, the new structure appears to be undulating and its 3-D distribution is well described by a damped sinusoidal wave on the plane of the Milky Way, with an average period of about 2 kpc and a maximum amplitude of about 160 pc. Our results represent a first step in the revision of the local gas distribution and Galactic structure and offer a new, broader context to studies on the transformation of molecular gas into stars."

We describe pgFARM (paired guide RNAs for alternative exon removal), a CRISPR-Cas9-based method to manipulate isoforms independent of gene inactivation. This approach enabled rapid suppression of exon recognition in polyclonal settings to identify functional roles for individual exons, such as an SMNDC1 cassette exon that regulates pan-cancer intron retention. We generalized this method to a pooled screen to measure the functional relevance of 'poison' cassette exons, which disrupt their host genes' reading frames yet are frequently ultraconserved. Many poison exons were essential for the growth of both cultured cells and lung adenocarcinoma xenografts, while a subset had clinically relevant tumor-suppressor activity. The essentiality and cancer relevance of poison exons are likely to contribute to their unusually high conservation and contrast with the dispensability of other ultraconserved elements for viability."

Developing a rice variety with inherent tolerance against these major abiotic stresses will help achieve a sustained increase in rice production under unfavorable conditions. The present study was conducted to develop abiotic stress-tolerant rice genotypes in the genetic background of the popular rice variety Improved White Ponni (IWP) by introgressing major effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring tolerance against drought (qDTY1.1, qDTY2.1), salinity (Saltol), and submergence (Sub1) through a marker assisted backcross breeding approach. Genotyping of early generation backcrossed inbred lines (BILs) resulted in the identification of three progenies, 3-11-9-2, 3-11-11-1, and 3-11-11-2, possessing all four target QTLs and maximum recovery of the recurrent parent genome (88.46%). BILs exhibited consistent agronomic and grain quality characters compared to those of IWP and enhanced performance against dehydration, salinity, and submergence stress compared with the recurrent parent IWP. BILs exhibited enhanced tolerance against salinity during germination and increased shoot length, root length, and vigor index compared to those of IWP. All three BILs exhibited reduced symptoms of injury because of salinity (NaCl) and dehydration (PEG) than did IWP. At 12 days of submergence stress, BILs exhibited enhanced survival and greater recovery, whereas IWP failed completely. BILs were found to exhibit on par grain and cooking quality characteristics with their parents. Results of this study clearly demonstrated the effects of the target QTLs in reducing damage caused by drought, salinity, and submergence and lead to the development of a triple stress tolerant version of IWP."
https://openalex.org/W2999600532,"Climate change poses a critical threat to the Pantanal, the largest wetland in the world. Models indicate an increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation events and extended periods of drought. These changes can amplify consequences for Pantanal's ecological functioning, which has already experienced intensive human modification of its hydrological system and environmental health. The present study analyzed the spatial and temporal dynamics of rainfall and resulting extremes in the Brazilian area of the Upper Paraguay River Basin (UPRB) along with a co-evaluation of the global Sea Surface Temperature data (SST). The predicted results indicate that wet extreme precipitation events will become more frequent in the highlands, while severe and prolonged droughts triggered by warming SSTs in the Northern Hemisphere (North Atlantic and North Pacific oceans) will affect the Pantanal. The linear relations between precipitation with SST of very specific oceanic regions and even from specific oceanic indexes obtained in the present study significantly improve the forecasting capacity, mainly from a resulting reduction to two months of the lead-time between SST warming to concomitant precipitation impacts, and by explaining 80% of Pantanal´s precipitation variation from major oceanic indexes (e.g., ENSO, PDO, NAO, ATL3). Current SST trends will result in inter- and intra-annual flooding dynamic alterations, drastically affecting the Pantanal ecosystem functioning, with consequences for wildlife diversity and distribution. Regarding the foreseeable global climate and land use change scenarios, the results from the present study provide solid evidence that can be used at different decision-making levels (from local to global) for identifying the most appropriate management practices and effectively achieving sustainability of the anthropic activity occurring in the Pantanal."

https://openalex.org/W2999163248,"Seaweed polyphenols and polysaccharide plays a broad range of biological activity. The objective of the present study was to study and compare the skin protection activity of fucoidan rich polysaccharide extract (SPS) and polyphenol-rich extract (SPP) from the seaweed Sargassum vachellianum. The skin protection activity was analyzed based on their ability to scavenge free radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals, UV absorption potential, tyrosinase inhibition, moisture preservation, and antibacterial activity. From the results, both SPP and SPS protects the skin from UV damage. SPP showed good free radical scavenging ability, antimicrobial activity against E.coli and S. aureus and effectively absorbed the UVB and UVA rays whereas SPS hardly absorbs the UVA and UVB rays and showed weak free radical scavenging ability and no antimicrobial activity. SPS showed considerable inhibition on tyrosinase (51.21%) and had better moisture absorption (52.1%) and retention (63.24%) abilities than SPP. The results specified that both SPS and SPP have balancing potential on skin protection and suitable combinations of both could act as an active ingredient in cosmetics."
https://openalex.org/W3000359296,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) which is caused by obesity and insulin resistance, is well known for its predictive capability for the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The development of MetS is associated with multiple genetic factors, environmental factors and lifestyle. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) related to MetS in large Korean population based samples of 1,362 subjects with MetS and 6,061 controls using the Axiom® Korean Biobank Array 1.0. We replicated the data in another sample including 502 subjects with MetS and 1,751 controls. After adjusting for age and sex, rs662799 located in the APOA5 gene were significantly associated with MetS. 15 SNPs in GCKR, C2orf16, APOA5, ZPR1, and BUD13 were associated with high triglyceride (TG). 14 SNPs in APOA5, ALDH1A2, LIPC, HERPUD1, and CETP, and 2 SNPs in MTNR1B were associated with low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high fasting blood glucose respectively. Among these SNPs, 6 TG SNPs: rs1260326, rs1260333, rs1919127, rs964184, rs2075295 and rs1558861 and 11 HDL-C SNPs: rs4775041, rs10468017, rs1800588, rs72786786, rs173539, rs247616, rs247617, rs3764261, rs4783961, rs708272, and rs7499892 were first discovered in Koreans. Additional research is needed to confirm these 17 novel SNPs in Korean population."
https://openalex.org/W3000716574,"Background Under the Free Maternity Policy (FMP), Kenya has witnessed an increase in health facility deliveries rather than home deliveries with Traditional Birth Attendants (TBA) resulting in improved maternal and neonatal outcomes. Despite these gains, maternal and infant mortality and morbidity rates in Kenya remain unacceptably high indicating that more needs to be done. Aim Using data from the Access to Quality Care through Extending and Strengthening Health Systems (AQCESS) project’s qualitative gender assessment, this paper examines women’s experience of disrespectful care during pregnancy, labour, and delivery. The goal is to promote an improved understanding of the actual care conditions to inform the development of interventions that can lift the standard of care, increase maternity facility use, and improve health outcomes for both women and newborns. Methodology We conducted sixteen focus group discussions (FGDs), two each for adolescent females, adult females, adult males, and community health committee members. As well, twenty-four key Informants interviews (KII) were also conducted including religious leaders, and persons from local government representatives, Ministry of Health (MOH), and local women’s organizations. Data were captured through audio recordings and reflective field notes. Research site Kisii and Kilifi Counties in Kenya. Findings Findings show nursing and medical care during labour and delivery were at times disrespectful, humiliating, uncompassionate, neglectful, or abusive. In both counties, male health workers were preferred by women giving birth, as they were perceived as more friendly and sensitive. Adolescent females were more likely to report abuse during maternity care while women with disabled children reported being stigmatized. Structural barriers related to transportation and available resources at facilities associated with disrespectful care were identified. Conclusions A focus on quality and compassionate care as well as more facility resources will lead to increased, successful, and sustainable use of facility care. Interpreting these results within a systems perspective, Kenya needs to implement, enforce, and monitor quality of care guidelines for pregnancy and delivery including respectful maternity care of pregnant women. To ensure these procedures are enforced, measurable benchmarks for maternity care need to be established, and hospitals need to be regularly monitored to ensure these benchmarks are achieved."
https://openalex.org/W2999827011,"Microvesicles are small lipid, bilayer structures (20–400 nm in diameter) secreted by bacteria, fungi, archaea and parasites involved in inter-bacterial communication and host-pathogen interactions. Lactobacillus reuteri DSM-17938 (DSM) has been shown to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of infantile colic, diarrhea and constipation. We have shown previously that luminal administration to the mouse gut promotes reduction of jejunal motility but increases that in the colon. The production of microvesicles by DSM has been characterized, but the effect of these microvesicles on gastrointestinal motility has yet to be evaluated. To investigate a potential mechanism for the effects of DSM on the intestine, the bacteria and its products have here been tested for changes in velocity, frequency, and amplitude of contractions in intact segments of jejunum and colon excised from mice. The effect of the parent bacteria (DSM) was compared to the conditioned media in which it was grown, and the microvesicles it produced. The media used to culture the bacteria (broth) was tested as a negative control and the conditioned medium was tested after the microvesicles had been removed. DSM, conditioned medium, and the microvesicles all produced comparable effects in both the jejunum and the colon. The treatments individually decreased the velocity and frequency of propagating contractile cluster contractions in the jejunum and increased them in the colon to a similar degree. The broth control had little effect in both tissues. Removal of the microvesicles from the conditioned medium almost completely eradicated their effect on motility in both tissues. These results show that the microvesicles from DSM alone can completely reproduce the effects of the whole bacteria on gut motility. Furthermore, they suggest a new approach to the formulation of orally active bacterial therapeutics and offer a novel way to begin to identify the active bacterial components."
https://openalex.org/W2998775495,"TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) has emerged as a key player in many neurodegenerative pathologies, including frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Hallmarks of both FTLD and ALS are the toxic cytoplasmic inclusions of the prion-like C-terminal fragments of TDP-43 CTD (TDP-43 C-terminal domain), formed upon proteolytic cleavage of full-length TDP-43 in the nucleus and subsequent transport to the cytoplasm. Both full-length TDP-43 and its CTD are also known to form stress granules by coacervating with RNA in the cytoplasm during stress and may be involved in these pathologies. Furthermore, mutations in the PGRN gene, leading to haploinsufficiency and diminished function of progranulin (PGRN) protein, are strongly linked to FTLD and ALS. Recent reports have indicated that proteolytic processing of PGRN to smaller protein modules called granulins (GRNs) contributes to FTLD and ALS progression, with specific GRNs exacerbating TDP-43–induced cytotoxicity. Here we investigated the interactions between the proteolytic products of both TDP-43 and PGRN. Based on structural disorder and charge distributions, we hypothesized that GRN-3 and GRN-5 could interact with the TDP-43 CTD. We show that, under both reducing and oxidizing conditions, GRN-3 and GRN-5 interact with and differentially modulate TDP-43 CTD aggregation and/or liquid–liquid phase separation in vitro. GRN-3 promoted insoluble aggregates of the TDP-43 CTD while GRN-5 mediated liquid–liquid phase separation. These results constitute the first observation of an interaction between GRNs and TDP-43, suggesting a mechanism by which attenuated PGRN function could lead to familial FTLD or ALS.

https://openalex.org/W2998902744,"Iron-folic acid supplementation during pregnancy is among the very effective interventions to prevent iron deficiency anemia, low birth weight, and prematurity. There is a need of having recent studies on adherence to the supplement that consider the very recent interventions targeted to scale up the use of iron-folic acid (IFA) supplement. Therefore we sought to assess adherence to IFA supplement and its associated factors among antenatal care attending pregnant mothers in governmental health institutions of Adwa town.Institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 629 antenatal care attending pregnant mothers. Systematic random sampling method was used to select the study subjects. Data were collected through face-to-face interview and chart-review. Bivariable and multivariable binary logistic regression was computed. Variables with P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant at 95% confidence interval (CI).Only 40.9% (95%CI: 37.0%- 44.7%) of participants were adherent (took four or more tablets per week). Women in the age group of 25-29 years [AOR: 2.22(1.21-4.07)] had increased odds of adherence as compared to those in the age group ≥ 35 years. Women who received nutrition counseling [AOR: 4.12(2.12-8.03)] and partner support [AOR: 2.23 (1.42-3.49)] had increased odds of adherence as compared to those who didn't receive nutrition counseling and partner support respectively. Similarly, women who had satisfactory knowledge on IFA supplement (AOR: 2.16(1.37-3.40)) had increased odds of adherence as compared to those who didn't have satisfactory knowledge on IFA supplement.Adherence to the supplement was low. Efforts shall be done to improve awareness of pregnant mothers about IFA supplement through targeted nutrition counseling that includes the engagement of a partner."
https://openalex.org/W2999628944,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells have been recently developed and are producing impressive outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies. However, there is no standardized method for cell trafficking and in vivo CAR T-cell monitoring. We assessed the feasibility of real-time in vivo 89Zr-p-Isothiocyanatobenzyl-desferrioxamine (Df-Bz-NCS, DFO) labeled CAR T-cell trafficking using positron emission tomography (PET).The 89Zr-DFO radiolabeling efficiency of Jurkat/CAR and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMC)/CAR T-cells was 70%-79%, and cell radiolabeling activity was 98.1-103.6 kBq/106 cells. Cell viability after radiolabeling was >95%. Cell proliferation was not significantly different during the early period after radiolabeling, compared with unlabeled cells; however, the proliferative capacity decreased over time (day 7 after labeling). IL-2 or IFN-γ secretion was not significantly different between unlabeled and labeled CAR T-cells. PET/magnetic resonance imaging in the xenograft model showed that most of the 89Zr-DFO-labeled Jurkat/CAR T-cells were distributed in the lung (24.4% ± 3.4%ID) and liver (22.9% ± 5.6%ID) by one hour after injection. The cells gradually migrated from the lung to the liver and spleen by day 1, and remained stable in these sites until day 7 (on day 7: lung 3.9% ± 0.3%ID, liver 36.4% ± 2.7%ID, spleen 1.4% ± 0.3%ID). No significant accumulation of labeled cells was identified in tumors. A similar pattern was observed in ex vivo biodistributions on day 7 (lung 3.0% ± 1.0%ID, liver 19.8% ± 2.2%ID, spleen 2.3% ± 1.7%ID). 89Zr-DFO-labeled hPBMC/CAR T-cells showed a similar distribution, compared with Jurkat/CAR T-cells, on serial PET images. CAR T cell distribution was cross-confirmed by flow cytometry, Alu polymerase chain reaction, and immunohistochemistry.Real-time in vivo cell trafficking is feasible using PET imaging of 89Zr-DFO-labeled CAR T-cells. This can be used to investigate cellular kinetics, initial in vivo biodistribution, and safety profiles in future CAR T-cell development."
https://openalex.org/W3000058399,"Urban nature is and will be the most common provider of nature interactions for humankind. The restorative benefits of nature exposure are renown and creating human habitats that simultaneously support people's wellbeing and ecological sustainability is an urgent priority. In this study, we investigate how the relationship between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems influences restorative experiences combining a place-based online survey with geographical data on ecosystem health in Stockholm (Sweden). Using spatial regression, we predict the 544 restorative experiences (from 325 respondents), with people's environmental attitudes, natural land covers, ecosystem health, and the statistical interactions among these variables as predictors. Our results show that restorative experiences can happen anywhere in the urban landscape, but when they occur in natural environments, the combined levels of biodiversity and ecological connectivity are better predicting factor than the mere presence of nature. That is, healthy ecosystems seem to be more important than just any nature for restorative experiences. Moreover, the statistical interaction between one's environmental attitudes and natural environments predict almost all restorative experiences better than when these variables are independent predictors. This suggests that there is synergistic compatibility between environmental attitudes and healthy ecosystems that triggers restorative processes. We call this synergy regenerative compatibility. Regenerative compatibility is an unexploited potential that emerges when people's attitudes and ecosystems are aligned in sustainability. We consider regenerative compatibility a valuable leverage point to transform towards ecologically sustainable and healthy urban systems. To this end, we encourage multifaceted policy interventions that regenerate human-nature relationships holistically rather than implement atomistic solutions."
https://openalex.org/W2998982144,"Endothelial activation and alteration during dengue virus (DENV) infection are multifactorial events; however, the role of extracellular vesicles (EVs) in these phenomena is not known. In the present study, we characterized the EVs released by DENV-2 infected U937 macrophage cell line and evaluated the changes in the physiology and integrity of the EA.hy926 endothelial cells exposed to them. U937 macrophages were infected, supernatants were collected, and EVs were purified and characterized. Then, polarized endothelial EA.hy926 cells were exposed to the EVs for 24 h, and the transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER), monolayer permeability, and the expression of tight junction and adhesion proteins and cytokines were evaluated. The isolated EVs from infected macrophages corresponded to exosomes and apoptotic bodies, which contained the viral NS3 protein and different miRs, among other products. Exposure of EA.hy926 cells to EVs induced an increase in TEER, as well as changes in the expression of VE-cadherin and ICAM in addition leads to an increase in TNF-α, IP-10, IL-10, RANTES, and MCP-1 secretion. These results suggest that the EVs of infected macrophages transport proteins and miR that induce early changes in the physiology of the endothelium, leading to its activation and eliciting a defense program against damage during first stages of the disease, even in the absence of the virus."
https://openalex.org/W2998905255,"A subset of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) contains short leukocyte telomeres or telomere related mutations. We previously showed that alveolar type 2 cells have short telomeres in fibrotic lesions. Our objectives were to better understand how telomere shortening associates with fibrosis in IPF lung and identify a subset of patients with telomere-related disease.Average telomere length was determined in multiple organs, basal and apical lung, and diagnostic and end-stage fibrotic lung biopsies. Alveolar type 2 cells telomere length was determined in different areas of IPF lungs.In IPF but not in controls, telomere length in lung was shorter than in other organs, providing rationale to focus on telomere length in lung. Telomere length did not correlate with age and no difference in telomere length was found between diagnostic and explant lung or between basal and apical lung, irrespective of the presence of a radiological apicobasal gradient or fibrosis. Fifteen out of 28 IPF patients had average lung telomere length in the range of patients with a telomerase (TERT) mutation, and formed the IPFshort group. Only in this IPFshort and TERT group telomeres of alveolar type 2 cells were extremely short in fibrotic areas. Additionally, whole exome sequencing of IPF patients revealed two genetic variations in RTEL1 and one in PARN in the IPFshort group.Average lung tissue telomere shortening does not associated with fibrotic patterns in IPF, however, approximately half of IPF patients show excessive lung telomere shortening that is associated with pulmonary fibrosis driven by telomere attrition."

The reported retention at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months were 90.7%, 78.1%, 68.8% and 64.4%, respectively. We report findings of a follow-up evaluation for the 2012-2015 cohorts to assess the implementation and impact of recommendations from this prior evaluation.A nationwide retrospective study was conducted in 2016. Multi-stage proportional sampling was used to select health facilities and study participants records. The data extracted from patient manual records included demographic, baseline clinical characteristics and patient outcomes (active on treatment, died, transferred out, stopped ART and lost to follow-up (LTFU)) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months. The data were analysed using Stata/IC 14.2. Retention was estimated using survival analysis. The predictors associated with attrition were determined using a multivariate Cox regression model.A total of 3,810 participants were recruited in the study. The median age in years was 35 (IQR: 28-42). Overall, retention increased to 92.4% (p-value = 0.060), 86.5% (p-value<0.001), 79.2% (p-value<0.001) and 74.4% (p-value<0.001) at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months respectively. LTFU accounted for 98% of attrition. Being an adolescent or a young adult (15-24 years) (vs adult;1.41; 95% CI:1.14-1.74), children (<15years) (vs adults; aHR 0.64; 95% CI:0.46-0.91), receiving care at primary health care facility (vs central and provincial facility; aHR 1.23; 95% CI:1.01-1.49), having initiated ART between 2014-2015 (vs 2012-2013; aHR1.45; 95%CI:1.24-1.69), having WHO Stage IV (vs Stage I-III; aHR2.06; 95%CI:1.51-2.81) and impaired functional status (vs normal status; aHR1.25; 95%CI:1.04-1.49) predicted attrition.The overall retention was higher in comparison to the previous 2007-2010 evaluation. Further studies to understand why attrition was found to be higher at primary health care facilities are warranted. Implementation of strategies for managing patients with advanced HIV disease, differentiated care for adolescents and young adults and tracking of LTFU clients should be prioritised to further improve retention."

Transcriptional control of cholesterol synthesis is relatively well-understood. However, of the ∼20 enzymes in cholesterol biosynthesis, post-translational regulation has only been examined for a small number. Three of the four sterol reductases in cholesterol production, 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR7), 14-dehydrocholesterol reductase (DHCR14), and lamin-B receptor (LBR), share evolutionary ties with a high level of sequence homology and predicted structural homology. DHCR14 and LBR uniquely share the same Δ-14 reductase activity in cholesterol biosynthesis, yet little is known about their post-translational regulation. We have previously identified specific modes of post-translational control of DHCR7, but it is unknown whether these regulatory mechanisms are shared by DHCR14 and LBR. Using CHO-7 cells stably expressing epitope-tagged DHCR14 or LBR, we investigated the post-translational regulation of these enzymes. We found that DHCR14 and LBR undergo differential post-translational regulation, with DHCR14 being rapidly turned over, triggered by cholesterol and other sterol intermediates, whereas LBR remained stable. DHCR14 is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system, and we identified several DHCR14 and DHCR7 putative interaction partners, including a number of E3 ligases that modulate DHCR14 levels. Interestingly, we found that gene expression across an array of human tissues showed a negative relationship between the C14-sterol reductases; one enzyme or the other tends to be predominantly expressed in each tissue.

LBR and DHCR14 share the same C14-sterol reductase (C14-SR) activity, reducing the carbon 14–15 double bond in sterol intermediates. The substrates and products of C14-SRs were initially ascribed meiotic activities (18Byskov A.G. Andersen C.Y. Leonardsen L. Baltsen M. Meiosis activating sterols (MAS) and fertility in mammals and man.J. Exp. Zool. 1999; 285 (10497322): 237-24210.1002/(SICI)1097-010X(19991015)285:3%3C237::AID-JEZ6%3E3.0.CO;2-SCrossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and were collectively called meiosis-activating sterols (MASs), consisting of FF-MAS (follicular fluid MAS) and T-MAS (testis MAS) (19Byskov A.G. Baltsen M. Andersen C.Y. Meiosis-activating sterols: background, discovery, and possible use.J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76 (9846952): 818-82310.1007/s001090050286Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). DHCR24 can act on these sterols to produce dihydro-FF-MAS or dihydro-T-MAS. DHCR14 and LBR emerged as a result of a gene duplication event (20Holmer L. Pezhman A. Worman H.J.

Whether DHCR14 or LBR is responsible for the majority of C14-SR activity in mammals has been contentious (15Bennati A.M. Castelli M. Della Fazia M.A. Beccari T. Caruso D. Servillo G. Roberti R.

DHCR14 localizes to the ER (20Holmer L. Pezhman A. Worman H.J.

Previous work has also highlighted that human DHCR14 has higher C14-SR activity than human LBR in microsomal preparations, suggesting that it is the major C14-SR in cholesterol biosynthesis (15Bennati A.M.

Despite the localization and higher activity of DHCR14, mice deficient in this enzyme have normal sterol profiles and an average life expectancy (25Bennati A.M. Schiavoni G. Franken S. Piobbico D.

Moreover, LBR knockout cells fail to thrive in sterol depleted conditions, whereas DHCR14 knockout cells were not challenged by the sterol-deficient environment (24Tsai P.-L. Zhao C. Turner E. Schlieker C.

LBR is a multidomain protein, localized at the inner nuclear membrane, consisting of the sterol reductase domain, which is homologous with DHCR14 and DHCR7, and an N-terminal Tudor domain that binds lamin-B, chromatin, and both assembled and unassembled histones H3 and H4 (26Soullam B. Worman H.J. The amino-terminal domain of the lamin B receptor is a nuclear envelope targeting signal.J.

Despite the role of LBR in binding lamin-B, LBR knockout cells do not have altered nuclear morphology (24Tsai P.-L. Zhao C. Turner E. Schlieker C.

In mouse models, LBR-null knockouts proved to be embryonically lethal (23Wassif C.A. Brownson K.E. Sterner A.L. Forlino A. Zerfas P.M. Wilson W.K. Starost M.F. Porter F.D. HEM dysplasia and ichthyosis are likely laminopathies and not due to 3β-hydroxysterol Δ14-reductase deficiency.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2007; 16 (17403717): 1176-118710.1093/hmg/ddm065Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and whereas the deleterious impact of LBR loss was initially presumed to only be a laminopathy, later work has indicated that knockout mice and cells have altered sterol profiles indicative of reduced C14-SR activity (24Tsai P.-L. Zhao C. Turner E. Schlieker C. The Lamin B receptor is essential for cholesterol synthesis and perturbed by disease-causing mutations.Elife. 2016; 5 (27336722): e1601110.7554/eLife.16011Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, LBR can complement ERG24 (the yeast homologue of the sterol reductase domain of LBR and DHCR14) knockouts, whereas DHCR14 is unable to compensate for this deficiency (21Silve S. Dupuy P.H. Ferrara P. Loison G. Human lamin B receptor exhibits sterol C14-reductase activity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1392 (9630650): 233-24410.1016/S0005-2760(98)00041-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 28Prakash A. Kasbekar D.P.

Biosci. 2002; 27 (11937680): 105-11210.1007/BF02703766Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Whereas the necessity of LBR cannot be disputed, it appears that both LBR and DHCR14 are used for C14-SR activity in mammalian cells. The enzymatic redundancy of these two C14-SRs may have an elusive functional role, and understanding the post-translational regulation of LBR and DHCR14 could help to clarify this conundrum. Here, we show that DHCR14 undergoes sterol-dependent turnover, whereas LBR does not. We elucidate the mechanism of post-translational regulation of DHCR14 and identify E3 ligases that modulate basal DHCR14 levels. We further identify a tissue-specific RNA expression pattern between TM7SF2 (the gene encoding DHCR14) and LBR, suggesting preferential use of particular C14-SRs in different tissues. Many cholesterol synthesis enzymes are transcriptionally controlled by sterol regulatory element–binding protein 2 (SREBP-2) (29Horton J.D. Shah N.A. Warrington J.A. Anderson N.N. Park S.W.

Zhao C. Turner E. Schlieker C.

We employed previously generated cDNA sets derived from CHO cells with sterol-related mutations, CHO-7 and SRD-1 (30Zerenturk E.J. Sharpe L.J. Brown A.J. Sterols regulate 3β-hydroxysterol Δ24-reductase (DHCR24) via dual sterol regulatory elements: cooperative induction of key enzymes in lipid synthesis by sterol regulatory element binding proteins.Biochim.

There is an increase in gene expression of SREBP-2 target genes in CHO-7 cells with statins and a decrease with oxysterol treatment. SRD-1 cells have constitutively active SREBP-2 and therefore high levels of SREBP-2 target genes, irrespective of cellular sterol status (31Metherall J.E. Goldstein J.L. Luskey K.L. Brown M.S.

We found that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), a canonical SREBP-2 target, follows this trend in expression. However, neither TM7SF2 nor LBR follow this pattern, showing no response to variable SREBP-2 levels in these cell lines (Fig. 2A). We next investigated the sterol-dependent transcriptional regulation of human TM7SF2 under different sterol conditions in three human-derived cell lines: Huh7 liver cells, Be(2)C brain cells, and HeLaT cervical cancer cells. Consistent with previous studies (15Bennati A.M. Castelli M. Della Fazia M.A. Beccari T. Caruso D. Servillo G. Roberti R.

V5-tagged DHCR14 localized to the ER, and the majority of LBR-V5 was observed around the nucleus (Fig. 3), indicating that the ectopically V5-tagged DHCR14 and LBR are located similarly to their endogenous counterparts. We investigated the post-translational regulation of both LBR and DHCR14 by comparing the turnover of these two C14-SR enzymes using a stably expressing system. This system, consisting of the human protein-coding sequence with a V5 epitope tag driven by the CMV promoter, was necessary to remove the normal transcriptional control by sterols. CHO-7 cells stably expressing V5-tagged human LBR or DHCR14 were treated with or without the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide for up to 8 h. In line with previous work (24Tsai P.-L. Zhao C.

However, DHCR14 was rapidly turned over, with less than 50% of the protein remaining after 1 h of treatment with cycloheximide (Fig. 4A).

https://openalex.org/W2999166224,"Background The gut dysbiosis associated with diabetes acquired before or after kidney transplantation (KT) has not been explored. Methods Patients transplanted at our institution provided fecal samples before, and 3–9 months after KT. Fecal bacterial DNA was extracted and 9 bacteria or bacterial groups were quantified by qPCR. Results 50 patients (19 controls without diabetes, 15 who developed New Onset Diabetes After Transplantation, NODAT, and 16 with type 2 diabetes before KT) were included. Before KT, Lactobacillus sp. tended to be less frequently detected in controls than in those who would become diabetic following KT (NODAT) and in initially diabetic patients (60%, 87.5%, and 100%, respectively, p = 0.08). The relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii was 30 times lower in initially diabetic patients than in controls (p = 0.002). The relative abundance of F. prausnitzii of NODAT patients was statistically indistinguishable from controls and from diabetic patients. The relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. increased following KT in NODAT and in initially diabetic patients (20-fold, p = 0.06, and 25-fold, p = 0.02, respectively). In contrast, the proportion of Akkermansia muciniphila decreased following KT in NODAT and in initially diabetic patients (2,500-fold, p = 0.04, and 50,000-fold, p<0.0001, respectively). The proportion of Lactobacillus and A. muciniphila did not change in controls between before and after the transplantation. Consequently, after KT the relative abundance of Lactobacillus sp. was 25 times higher (p = 0.07) and the relative abundance of A. muciniphila was 2,000 times lower (p = 0.002) in diabetics than in controls. Conclusion An alteration of the gut microbiota composition involving Lactobacillus sp., A. muciniphila and F. prausnitzii is associated with the glycemic status in KT recipients, raising the question of their role in the genesis of NODAT."
https://openalex.org/W2999335473,"Access to safe, effective and affordable medicines of good quality is included into the Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations. Furthermore, WHO has developed a Global Action Plan with the aim to raise access to essential medicines against non-communicable diseases (NCDs) to 80%, and to improve their affordability. In order to contribute to the monitoring of progress towards these goals, the present study investigated the availability and affordability of seven antibiotics and six medicines against non-communicable diseases in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of Congo and the west of the Republic of Cameroon. Data on availability and prices of these medicines were collected in 60 different sites (34 in the DR Congo, 26 in Cameroon), including government health facilities, church health facilities, private pharmacies and informal vendors, as part of a study on medicine quality. The data were analyzed using a standardized procedure developed by WHO and Health Action International (HAI). Average availability of the investigated antibiotics ranged from 62% to 98% in the different types of facilities in both countries, including the informal vendors. Average availability for medicines against NCDs in the different types of facilities showed a higher variation in both countries, ranging from 11% up to 87%. The average availability of medicines against NCDs in government health facilities was only 33% in Cameroon, and as low as 11% in the DR Congo. In contrast, availability of medicines against NCDs in church health facilities in Cameroon was 70%, not far from the 80% availability goal set by WHO. Medicine prices were clearly higher in Cameroon than in the DR Congo, with median price ratios to an international reference price of 5.69 and 2.17, respectively (p < 0.001). In relation to the daily minimum wages in both countries, treatment courses with five of the seven investigated antibiotics could be considered as affordable, while in each country only one out of the five investigated medicines against NCDs could be considered as affordable. Especially generic medicines provided by government and church health facilities showed reasonable affordability in most cases, while originator medicines offered by private pharmacies were clearly unaffordable to a major part of the population. Despite some encouraging findings on the availability of antibiotics in both countries, the availability and affordability of medicines against NCDs urgently requires further improvements."
https://openalex.org/W2999812214,"A poly (l-lactic) acid bioengineered anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) matrix has previously demonstrated the ability to support tissue regeneration in a rabbit ACL reconstruction model. The matrix was designed for optimal bone and ligament regeneration by developing a matrix with differential pore sizes in its bone and ligament compartments. Building upon past success, we designed a new bioengineered ACL matrix that is easier to install and can be used with endobutton fixation during ACL reconstruction. To achieve this, a new braiding procedure was developed to allow the matrix to be folded in half, making two-limbs, while maintaining its bone and ligament compartments. The osteointegration of the matrix with and without bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) supplementation was evaluated in a rabbit ACL reconstruction model. Two doses of BMP-2 were evaluated, 1 and 10 μg, and delivered by saline injection into the bone tunnel at the end of surgery. A fibrous matrix-to-bone interface with occasional Sharpey’s fibers was the primary mode of osteointegration observed. The matrix was also found to support a fibrocartilage matrix-to-bone interface. In some cases, the presence of chondrocyte-like cells was observed at the aperture of the bone tunnel and the center of the matrix within the bone tunnel. Treatment with BMP-2 was associated with a trend towards smaller bone tunnel cross-sectional areas, and 1 μg of BMP-2 was found to significantly enhance osteoid seam width in comparison with no BMP-2 or 10 μg of BMP-2 treatment. Regenerated tissue was well organized within the bioengineered ACL matrix and aligned with the poly (l-lactic) acid fibers. Disorganized tissue was found between the two-limbs of the bioengineered ACL matrix and hypothesized to be due to a lack of structural scaffolding. This study suggests that the bioengineered ACL matrix can undergo similar modes of osteointegration as current autografts and allografts, and that BMP-2 treatment may enhance osteoblastic activity within the bone tunnels."

Substitution of Asn255 with phenylalanine (N255F), together with substitution of Trp273 with alanine (W273A), generated an active site mimicking that of known lysine methyltransferases. The doubly substituted SETD3 variant exhibited a 13-fold preference for lysine over histidine. We show, by means of X-ray crystallography, that the two target nitrogen atoms—the N3 atom of histidine and the terminal ϵ-amino nitrogen of lysine—occupy the same position and point toward and are within a short distance of the incoming methyl group of SAM for a direct methyl transfer during catalysis. In contrast, SETD3 and its Asn255 substituted derivatives did not methylate glutamine (another potentially methylated amino acid).

Here we investigate the structural and molecular determinant(s) of target specificity of histidine versus lysine versus glutamine in the active site of SETD3. methyltransferase isothermal titration calorimetry. Most, if not all, enzymatic reactions of SAM-dependent MTases, including those of histidine methylation catalyzed by SETD3 and the lysine methylation catalyzed by SETD6 and LSMT, are thought to proceed with direct transfer of the methyl group to substrate from the methyl donor S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) (23Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: A chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem.

This reaction also requires a deprotonation step, in which a proton is removed before, concurrent with, or after methyl transfer. Even within the structurally conserved family of SET domain MTases, a variety of mechanisms have evolved to activate the catalytic nucleophile, dependent on the polarizability of the target atom. For example, lysine methylation by DIM-5, LSMT, and SETD6 showed maximal in vitro activity at approximately pH 10, principally because of the pKa value of ∼10 for a lysine substrate (19Chang Y.

Histidine methylation by SETD3 has an optimum pH of 7 and above, in agreement with the imidazole ring having a typical pKa value near 6 (17Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis for the target specificity of actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3.Nat.

Another aspect of these reactions is that the MTases have to position the target atom such that the lone-pair electrons on the (nitrogen) nucleophile point toward, and within a short distance of, the incoming methyl group. The methyl transfer is followed by an attack on the positively charged sulfonium of SAM with an inversion of symmetry in a SN2-like mechanism (26Coward J.K. Chemical mechanisms of methyl transfer reactions: Comparison of methylases with nonenzymic model reactions.′.in: Salvatore F. The Biochemistry of Adenosylmethionine.

Here we compare the active-site configurations of the histidine methyltransferase SETD3 with the lysine methyltransferases SETD6 and LSMT by mutagenesis and assay its activities on histidine, lysine, and glutamine (as another physiologically methylated amino acid) in the context of actin peptide. Our previous structural characterizations of SETD3 included the prereactive substrate complex and the postreactive product complex containing an actin peptide encompassing target His73 of actin (17Dai S. Horton J.R. Woodcock C.B. Wilkinson A.W. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis for the target specificity of actin histidine methyltransferase SETD3.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10 (31388018): 354110.1038/s41467-019-11554-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The histidine imidazole ring contains two nitrogen atoms (N1 and N3), both of which can be protonated. To ensure that the target atom N3 is deprotonated prior to the methyl transfer, Asn255 forms a hydrogen bond to the protonated N1 nitrogen (Fig. 1A). With substitution of Asn255 to alanine (N255A), valine (N255V), or phenylalanine (N255F), SETD3 loses the ability to form this hydrogen bond; this results in reduced activity for His73 methylation with slower kcat values (N255A and N255V), and surprisingly for N255F, no measurable activity was observed for histidine methylation (Fig. 1, B–D). We reasoned that the bulky side chain of phenylalanine at residue 255 could collide with neighboring Trp273 (Fig. 1E). Structure-based sequence alignment indicated that three of four residues (Asn255, Trp273, Ile310, and Tyr312) that form the active-site pocket in SETD3 are not conserved in LSMT and SETD6 (Fig. 1F). The corresponding SETD3 residues Asn255 and Trp273 are phenylalanine and alanine in both LSMT and SETD6 (Fig. 1G). Thus, we generated a variant of SETD3 with two alterations in the active site, N255F and W273A. We first measured the activities of SETD3 (WT) and the double mutant on actin peptide residues 66–80 containing His73. Unlike the N255F single mutation, the double mutant showed a measurable activity on His73 with kcat of 2.8 h−1 and Km of 54 μm (Fig. 2A). Nevertheless, the double mutant exhibited a reaction rate of ∼15-fold slower (kcat) and an affinity for the substrate ∼2-fold weaker (Km) than that of WT SETD3 under the same conditions, resulting in ∼36-fold loss in catalytic efficiency (comparing kcat/Km values) for His73 methylation (Fig. 2A). Because the double mutant was designed to mimic the active sites of LSMT and SETD6, both of which catalyze protein lysine methylation, we asked whether the double mutant is capable of methylating lysine in the place of His73 (H73K) in the context of the same actin peptide residues 66–80. Interestingly, the activities of WT and double mutant SETD3 on Lys73 methylation flipped the order of preference (Fig. 2B). The double mutant demonstrated a ∼500-fold gain in catalytic efficiency for Lys73 methylation, compared to that of WT (kcat/Km value of 0.66 h−1 μm−1 for the mutant and 1.3 × 10−3 h−1 μm−1 for the WT). The gain in catalytic efficiency is driven by an improved reaction rate (∼105× in kcat) and stronger binding for the substrate (∼5× in Km). In essence, the double mutant variant of SETD3 has switched the identity of SETD3 from a histidine MTase into a lysine MTase. We note that the WT SETD3 demonstrated ∼1385-fold preference of His73 over Lys73 methylation in catalytic efficiency, whereas the mutant showed a ∼13-fold preference of Lys73 over His73 methylation. Thus, comparing the mutant to WT, the ratio of catalytic efficiency on Lys73 to His73 methylation is increased by ∼18,000-fold (= 1385 × 13). To facilitate co-crystallization, we increased the peptide length to actin residues 66–88. As observed in the previous structural work, the additional C-terminal actin residues engage in additional intermolecular interactions with SETD3 (16Guo Q. Liao S. Kwiatkowski S. Tomaka W. Yu H. Wu G. Tu X. Min J. Drozak J. Xu C.

The enhanced enzyme-peptide interactions increased binding affinity by decreasing the Km value but do not change the reaction rate by maintaining the same kcat value (Fig. 2C). The double mutant was readily crystallized with the Lys73 (66–88) peptide in the presence of SAH (Fig. 3A). The mutant-Lys73 structure is highly similar to those of WT enzyme in complex with His73 (PDB ID 6MBL), with pairwise comparison of ∼0.4 Å across 458 pairs of Cα atoms. The target lysine residue is inserted into the active-site channel, where at the end of the channel the terminal ϵ-amino nitrogen atom meets the cofactor from the opposite end (Fig. 3B). The channel is bordered by the aromatic residues of Tyr312 and N255F, which pack against the aliphatic portion of the target lysine. The side chains of the two mutated residues, N255F and W273A, are sufficiently separated (Fig. 3C). Superimposition of WT-His73 and the mutant-Lys73 complex structures indicated that the two target nitrogen atoms, i.e. the terminal ϵ-amino nitrogen of lysine and the N3 atom of unmethylated histidine ring, reside at nearly the same position (Fig. 3D). The side chain aliphatic carbons of lysine trace along the edge of superimposed histidine ring in five-bond distances from the main chain Cα atom to the target nitrogen atom (Fig. 3D). The ϵ-amino group of the target lysine is 3.4 Å away from the sulfur atom of SAH, where a transferable methyl group would be attached (Fig. 3E). The distance between the sulfur of SAH and Nϵ of lysine is approximately the sum of the bond distance of donor-methyl (S+–CH3 = 1.82 Å) and the bond distance of acceptor-methyl (CH3–N+ = 1.47 Å). A water molecule (w1), coordinated by the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atoms of Cys276 and W273A, could facilitate the deprotonation of the target ϵ-amino group of lysine during catalysis (Fig. 3, E and F). Comparisons of the double mutant structure of SETD3 to that of LSMT and SETD6 show that the features of the active-site configurations for lysine methylation are highly preserved (Fig. 4). The aromatic side chains of Tyr-Phe pair (Tyr312–N255F in SETD3, Tyr287–Phe224 in LSMT, and Tyr285–Phe225 in SETD6) guide the target lysine into a narrow channel. In addition, the hydroxyl oxygen atom of the Tyr interacts and stabilizes the positive charge on the SAM methylsulfonium group (CH3–S+). As a result, the deprotonated amino group (NH2) of the target lysine is positioned at the right distance to be able to nucleophilically attack the positively charged SAM methylsulfonium without any general base. Human HemK2 has recently been documented to be a histone H4 lysine 12 MTase (renamed as KMT9) (10Metzger E. Wang S. Urban S. Willmann D. Schmidt A. Offermann A. Allen A. Sum M. Obier N. Cottard F.

We confirmed that HemK2 is active on glutamine and lysine (29Woodcock C.B. Yu D. Zhang X. Cheng X.

The common feature of the two potential substrates is the amino group (NH2) of glutamine and lysine (Fig. 5A). Unlike SET domain MTases, HemK2/KMT9 is a seven-β-stranded family MTase (23Schubert H.L. Blumenthal R.M. Cheng X. Many paths to methyltransfer: A chronicle of convergence.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28 (12826405): 329-33510.1016/S0968-0004(03)00090-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3D, the side chain of the lysine residue, with a length of 5-bond distance between the Cα atom and the terminal Nϵ nitrogen, adopts a bent conformation such that its aliphatic carbons could seemingly trace along one edge of the histidine imidazole ring. We asked whether the side chain of a glutamine residue, with a length of 4-bond distance, could trace along the shorter edge of the imidazole ring to reach the target position in the active site of SETD3 (Fig. 5A). In the context of the same actin peptide residues 66–88, we replaced the His73 by glutamine (Gln73). Under the saturating conditions of an overnight reaction, in which SETD3 totally completes reaction on all given His73 substrate, we observed no activity of SETD3 or its mutants on the Gln73 peptide (Fig. 5B). However, we did observe direct binding between SETD3 and the Gln73 peptide with a dissociation constant (KD) of ∼0.7 μm by isothermal titration calorimetry (Fig. 5C). The Gln73 peptide competes with the substrate peptide by inhibiting SETD3 activity on His73 with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of ∼1 μm (Fig. 5D). To further understand the structural basis of the binding of SETD3 with Gln73-containing peptide, we crystallized and determined the inactive complex structure at the resolution of 2.0 Å (Table S1). The Gln73 structure is essentially the same to that of His73-containing structure (root mean square deviation = 0.169 Å over 886 pairs of Cα atoms with two complexes per crystallographic asymmetric unit). The side chain of Gln73 occupies the active site, but its amide group is >5 Å away from the sulfur of SAH (Fig. 5E). At the resolution of 2.0 Å, we were not able to determine the exact nature of oxygen versus nitrogen atom of Gln73 side chain. However, the chemical nature of interacting functional groups, particularly the side chain of Asn255 and its associated water molecule, allowed us to position the Gln73 side chain as shown in Fig. 5E. The water molecule (w2) is saturated with tetrahedral coordination of four hydrogen bonds: two H-bond donors to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Arg253 and one of the side chain carboxylate oxygen atoms of Asp274 and two H-bond acceptors from the main chain amide nitrogen of Ile270 and side chain amide nitrogen of Asn255 (Fig. 5E). Asn255 forms a weak hydrogen bond (via its side chain oxygen atom) with the amide group of Gln73, which is positioned more than 5 Å away from the sulfur atom of SAH where a transferable methyl group would be attached. In comparison, the corresponding distance is ∼3.4 Å between the ϵ-amino group of the target lysine (or the N3 of histidine) and the sulfur atom of SAH (Fig. 3D). Although we initially used SAH in the mixture for the crystallization, we were surprised to find that the difference electron density clearly shows one distinguishable location with Fo − Fc at 4σ above the mean, ∼1.8 Å from the sulfur atom of SAH (Fig. 5F; we note again the bond distance of S+–CH3 is 1.82 Å). We interpreted that this density most likely be the methyl group of donor SAM (Fig. 5G), which might co-purify with SETD3 endogenously (as with SETD6 (19Chang Y. Levy D. Horton J.R. Peng J. Zhang X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Structural basis of SETD6-mediated regulation of the NF-kB network via methyl-lysine signaling.Nucleic Acids Res. 2011; 39 (21515635): 6380-638910.1093/nar/gkr256Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) (Fig. 5H). We reasoned that the endogenous SAM cofactors were not fully exchanged during the sample preparation because Gln73-containing peptide is not a substrate. We superimposed the Gln73 structure to that of SETD3 bound with methylated His73 (PDB ID 6OX2), which revealed the difference density is immediately adjacent to the methyl group attached to the N3 atom of the methylhistidine (Fig. 5I). This comparison illustrated that the target nitrogen atom has to be primed in a position toward the incoming methyl group within a short distance during the catalysis. The inactivity on Gln73 presumably reflects the fact that the amide nitrogen of Gln73 is not positioned in close enough proximity to the donor methyl group of SAM for nucleophilic attack (Fig. 5I). We rotated the side chain torsion angles of Gln73 to trace the edge of the histidine ring and forced the amide nitrogen onto the N3 atom of His73 (Fig. 5J). In this assumed conformation, the side chain oxygen atom of Gln73 points directly toward and smashes with the aromatic ring of Tyr312. As noted above, Tyr312 is the only active-site residue conserved among SETD3, SETD6, and LSMT (Fig. 1G), as well as almost all SET domain MTases (6Dillon S.C. Zhang X. Trievel R.C. Cheng X.

Structure of the Neurospora SET domain protein DIM-5, a histone H3 lysine methyltransferase.Cell. 2002; 111 (12372305): 117-12710.1016/S0092-8674(02)00999-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) with the hydroxyl oxygen fitting between the two moieties of the cofactor (Fig. 5E). Thus, the rigid Tyr312 would push away the side chain of Gln73 and restrain it in nonproductive position as observed in the crystal. A wide variety of macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, and a range of small molecules are subject to methylation by highly specific SAM-dependent MTases acting on a particular target atom. Examples of methylation targets include nucleic acids (cytosine-C5, cytosine-N4, and adenine-N6), protein residues (arginine-N, lysine-N, glutamine-N, and histidine-N), and small molecules (catechol-O, histamine-N, glycine-N, and thiopurine-S). The SET domain–catalyzed protein methylation has demonstrated that these enzymes frequently have high substrate specificity because of recognition of the various sequences surrounding the target residue (30Yin Y.

https://openalex.org/W2999219829,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of non-invasive brain stimulation that safely modulates brain excitability and has therapeutic potential for many conditions. Several studies have shown that anodal tDCS of the primary motor cortex (M1) facilitates motor learning and plasticity, but there is little information about the underlying mechanisms. Using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), it has been shown that tDCS can affect local levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Glx (a measure of glutamate and glutamine combined) in adults, both of which are known to be associated with skill acquisition and plasticity; however this has yet to be studied in children and adolescents. This study examined GABA and Glx in response to conventional anodal tDCS (a-tDCS) and high definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) targeting the M1 in a pediatric population. Twenty-four typically developing, right-handed children ages 12–18 years participated in five consecutive days of tDCS intervention (sham, a-tDCS or HD-tDCS) targeting the right M1 while training in a fine motor task (Purdue Pegboard Task) with their left hand. Glx and GABA were measured before and after the protocol (at day 5 and 6 weeks) using a PRESS and GABA-edited MEGA-PRESS MRS sequence in the sensorimotor cortices. Glx measured in the left sensorimotor cortex was higher in the HD-tDCS group compared to a-tDCS and sham at 6 weeks (p = 0.001). No changes in GABA were observed in either sensorimotor cortex at any time. These results suggest that neither a-tDCS or HD-tDCS locally affect GABA and Glx in the developing brain and therefore it may demonstrate different responses in adults."

Here we characterize >600 field and single zoospore isolates of Phytophthora capsici for inheritance of mating type, sensitivity to mefenoxam, chromosome copy number and heterozygous allele frequencies. The A2 mating type was highly unstable with 26% of 241 A2 isolates remaining A2. The A1 mating type was stable. Isolates intermediately resistant to mefenoxam produced fully resistant single-spore progeny. Sensitive isolates remained fully sensitive. Genome re-sequencing of single zoospore isolates revealed extreme aneuploidy; a phenomenon dubbed Dynamic Extreme Aneuploidy (DEA). DEA is characterized by the asexual inheritance of diverse intra-genomic combinations of chromosomal ploidy ranging from 2N to 3N and heterozygous allele frequencies that do not strictly correspond to ploidy. Isolates sectoring on agar media showed dramatically altered heterozygous allele frequencies. DEA can explain the rapid increase of advantageous alleles (e.g. drug resistance), mating type switches and copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Although the mechanisms driving DEA are unknown, it can play an important role in adaptation and evolution and seriously hinders all aspects of P. capsici research."

Purified IcsA passenger domain was able block S. flexneri adherence and was also used as a molecular probe that recognised multiple components from host cells. The region within IcsA's functional passenger domain (aa 138-148) was identified by mutagenesis. Upon the deletion of this region, the purified IcsAΔ138-148 was found to no longer block S. flexneri adherence and had reduced ability to interact with host molecules. Furthermore, S. flexneri expressing IcsAΔ138-148 was found to be significantly defective in both cell adherence and invasion. Taken together, our data identify an adherence region within the IcsA functional domain and provides useful information for designing therapeutics for Shigella infection."
https://openalex.org/W2999013294,"Nanotrap® (NT) particles are hydrogel microspheres developed for target analyte separation and discovery applications. NT particles consist of cross-linked N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) copolymers that are functionalized with a variety of chemical affinity baits to enable broad-spectrum collection and retention of target proteins, nucleic acids, and pathogens. NT particles have been previously shown to capture and enrich arboviruses including Rift Valley fever and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Yet, there is still a need to enhance the detection ability for other re-emerging viruses such as Zika (ZIKV), chikungunya (CHIKV), and dengue (DENV) viruses. In this study, we exploited NT particles with different affinity baits, including cibacron blue, acrylic acid, and reactive red 120, to evaluate their capturing and enrichment capability for ZIKV, DENV and CHIKV in human fluids. Our results demonstrate that CN1030, a NT particle conjugated with reactive red 120, can recover between 8-16-fold greater genomic copies of ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in virus spiked urine samples via RT-qPCR, superior to the other chemical baits. Also, we observed that CN1030 simultaneously enriched ZIKV, CHIKV and DENV in co-infection-based settings and could stabilize ZIKV, but not CHIKV infectivity in saliva spiked samples. CN1030 enriched viral detection at various viral concentrations, with significant enhancement observed at viral titers as low as 100 PFU/mL for ZIKV and 10 PFU/mL for CHIKV. The detection of ZIKV was further enhanced with NT particles by processing of larger volume urine samples. Furthermore, we developed a magnetic NT particle, CN3080, based on the same backbone of CN1030, and demonstrated that CN3080 could also capture and enrich ZIKV and CHIKV in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, in silico docking predictions support that the affinity between reactive red 120 and ZIKV or CHIKV envelope proteins appeared to be greater than acrylic acid. Overall, our data show that NT particles along with reactive red 120 can be utilized as a pre-processing technology for enhancement of detecting febrile-illness causing viruses."

Shortly after gonadal sex determination it is up-regulated in the developing testes following a very similar spatial and temporal pattern as the male-determining gene Sry in Sertoli cells before switching to ovarian enriched expression. To test if Hmgcs2 is important for gonad development in mammals, we pursued two lines of investigations. Firstly, we generated Hmgcs2-null mice using CRISPR/Cas9 and found that these mice had gonads that developed normally even on a sensitized background. Secondly, we screened 46,XY DSD patients with gonadal dysgenesis and identified two unrelated patients with a deletion and a deleterious missense variant in HMGCS2 respectively. However, both variants were heterozygous, suggesting that HMGCS2 might not be the causative gene. Analysis of a larger number of patients in the future might shed more light into the possible association of HMGCS2 with human gonadal development."

https://openalex.org/W2999937265,"The PI3K/Akt pathway is interconnected to protein kinase CK2, which directly phosphorylates Akt1 at S129. We have previously found that, in HK-2 renal cells, downregulation of the CK2 regulatory subunit β (shCK2β cells) reduces S129 Akt phosphorylation. Here, we investigated in more details how the different CK2 isoforms impact on Akt and other signaling pathways. We found that all CK2 isoforms phosphorylate S129 in vitro, independently of CK2β. However, in HK-2 cells the dependence on CK2β was confirmed by rescue experiments (CK2β re-expression in shCK2β HK-2 cells), suggesting the presence of additional components that drive Akt recognition by CK2 in cells. We also found that CK2β downregulation altered the phosphorylation ratio between the two canonical Akt activation sites (pT308 strongly reduced, pS473 slightly increased) in HK-2 cells. Similar results were found in other cell lines where CK2β was stably knocked out by CRISPR-Cas9 technology. The phosphorylation of rpS6 S235/S236, a downstream effector of Akt, was strongly reduced in shCK2β HK-2 cells, while the phosphorylation of two Akt direct targets, PRAS40 T246 and GSK3β S9, was increased. Differently to what observed in response to CK2β down-regulation, the chemical inhibition of CK2 activity by cell treatment with the specific inhibitor CX-4945 reduced both the Akt canonical sites, pT308 and pS473. In CX-4945-treated cells, the changes in rpS6 pS235/S236 and GSK3β pS9 mirrored those induced by CK2β knock-down (reduction and slight increase, respectively); on the contrary, the effect on PRAS40 pT246 phosphorylation was sharply different, being strongly reduced by CK2 inhibition; this suggests that this Akt target might be dependent on Akt pS473 status in HK-2 cells. Since PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2/p90rsk pathways are known to be interconnected and both modulated by CK2, with GSK3β pS9 representing a convergent point, we investigated if ERK1/2/p90rsk signaling was affected by CK2β knock-down and CX-4945 treatment in HK-2 cells. We found that p90rsk was insensitive to any kind of CK2 targeting; therefore, the observation that, similarly, GSK3β pS9 was not reduced by CK2 blockade suggests that GSK3β phosphorylation is mainly under the control of p90rsk in these cells. However, we found that the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 reduced GSK3β pS9, and concomitantly decreased Snail1 levels (a GSK3β target and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal transition marker). The effects of LY294002 were observed also in CK2β-downregulated cells, suggesting that reducing GSK3β pS9 could be a strategy to control Snail1 levels in any situation where CK2β is defective, as possibly occurring in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2999011668,"Pathogen challenges are often accompanied by reductions in feed intake, making it difficult to differentiate impacts of reduced feed intake from impacts of pathogen on various response parameters. Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the impact of Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) and feed intake on parameters of jejunal function and integrity in growing pigs. Twenty-four pigs (11.34 ± 1.54 kg BW) were randomly selected and allotted to 1 of 3 treatments (n = 8 pigs/treatment): 1) PRRSV naïve, ad libitum fed (Ad), 2) PRRSV-inoculated, ad libitum fed (PRRS+), and 3) PRRSV naïve, pair-fed to the PRRS+ pigs’ daily feed intake (PF). At 17 days post inoculation, all pigs were euthanized and the jejunum was collected for analysis. At days post inoculation 17, PRRS+ and PF pigs had decreased (P < 0.05) transepithelial resistance compared with Ad pigs; whereas fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4 kDa permeability was not different among treatments. Active glucose transport was increased (P < 0.05) in PRRS+ and PF pigs compared with Ad pigs. Brush border carbohydrase activity was reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with PF pigs for lactase (55%; P = 0.015), sucrase (37%; P = 0.002), and maltase (30%; P = 0.015). For all three carbohydrases, Ad pigs had activities intermediate that of PRRS+ and PF pigs. The mRNA abundance of the tight junction proteins claudin 2, claudin 3, claudin 4, occludin, and zonula occludens-1 were reduced in PRRS+ pigs compared with Ad pigs; however, neither the total protein abundance nor the cellular compartmentalization of these tight junction proteins differed among treatments. Taken together, this study demonstrates that the changes that occur to intestinal epithelium structure, function, and integrity during a systemic PRRSV challenge can be partially explained by reductions in feed intake. Further, long term adaptation to PRRSV challenge and caloric restriction does reduce intestinal transepithelial resistance but does not appear to reduce the integrity of tight junction protein complexes."

Nevertheless, their clinical utility in patients with breast cancer remains a subject of discussion and controversy; thus, additional markers may prove useful in monitoring the therapeutic responses of these patients. The extracellular domain of HER2 can be shed by proteolytic cleavage into the circulation and this shed form, sHER2, is reported to be augmented during metastasis of HER2-positive breast tumors. Here, we studied the clinical usefulness of sHER2, CA15.3, and CEA for monitoring treatment for breast cancer. Methods We measured prospectively pretreatment and post-treatment serum levels (day 1, 30, 60 and 90) of these three biomarkers in 47 HER2-positive, metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab in combination with paclitaxel. Evaluation of the disease was performed according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) at day 90. Results Patients with progressive disease at day 90 had smaller relative changes between day 1 and day 30 than those with complete, partial or stable responses at day 90: -9% versus -38% for sHER2 (P = 0.02), +23% versus -17% for CA15.3 (P = 0.005) and +29% versus -26% for CEA (P = 0.02). Patients with progressive disease at day 90 were less likely than the other patients to have a relative decrease of > 20% in their biomarker levels at day 30: 6% vs 33% for sHER2 (P = 0.03), 0% vs 27% for CA15.3 (P = 0.03), 4% vs 29% for CEA (P = 0.04). No patient with progressive disease at day 90 had > 20% reduction of the average combined biomarker levels at day 30 whereas 63% of the other patients had (P = 0.003). Moreover, when we analyzed a > 10% reduction of the average biomarker levels no patient with progressive disease at day 90 had a decrease > 10% at day 30 whereas 78% of other patients had (P<0.001, Se = 100%, Sp = 78%). Conclusion We show that regular measurement of sHER2, CA15.3, and CEA levels is useful for predicting the therapeutic response and for monitoring HER2-targeted therapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. The average decrease of the three biomarkers with a threshold of > 10% appears to be the best parameter to distinguish patients who go on to have progressive disease from those who will have a complete, partial or stable response."
https://openalex.org/W3000204619,"Purpose We sought to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of dome-shaped macula (DSM) in children and adolescents with myopia. Methods A retrospective review of medical records was performed to identify subjects who were younger than 19 years with myopia of −3.0 diopters or greater. The results of optical coherence tomography images were analyzed to identify DSM. The height and diameter of the dome were measured. Age, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and refractive error of study participants who exhibited DSM were compared with those of patients who did not. Results Among the 1,042 eyes of 615 patients, eight eyes (0.77%) of seven patients had DSM. Six of these eight eyes were not highly myopic (i.e., less than −6.0 diopters of spherical equivalents). Additionally, the mean height and diameter of the identified domes were 146.50 ± 42.33 μm and 4779.75 ± 699.38 μm, respectively. Patients with DSM were significantly older (mean age: 15.88 ± 2.36 years) than patients without it (11.51 ± 4.60 years; p = 0.007). The youngest affected patient was 11 years old. There was no significant difference in refractive errors (p = 0.629) or BCVA (p = 0.314) between the two groups. Conclusions Although the incidence in this study was very low, DSM was found even in children and adolescents. In addition, 75% of affected individuals were not highly myopic. These results suggest that inherent traits may be involved in development of DSM."

According to the color of persistent calyx, SS is categorized into two classes: the yellowish-green-type and the brownish-type. Based on the chemometrics analysis of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a novel model of identifying and evaluating the quality of SS in different colors was constructed for the first time in this work. 20 batches SS samples of different colors were collected and used to extract essential oils. The average essential oils yield of SS in yellowish-green color was significantly higher than that of SS in brownish color from the same origin (p<0.05). The GC-MS fingerprints of 20 batches SS samples whose correlation coefficients were over 0.964 demonstrated SS samples were consistent to some extent in spite of slightly different chemical indexes. A total of 39 common volatiles compounds were identified. Hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) were developed to distinguish SS samples characterized by different colors. Consistent results were obtained to show that SS samples could be successfully grouped according to their color. Finally, 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-3,6-dimethyl-benzofuran and pulegone were detected as the key variables for discriminating SS samples of different colors and for quality control. The obtained results proved that SS of good quality were often yellowish-green and those of poor quality were often brownish."

However, despite the increased number of published articles dedicated to eDNA in soil, so far only few are focused on its single stranded form (eDNAss). The present paper is the first to investigate the quantitative relevance of eDNAss in the total soil eDNA pool, discriminating between its linear (eDNAssl) and circular (eDNAssc) forms and the respective weakly (wa) and tightly (ta) adsorbed fractions. The results showed the prevalence of eDNAss and its linear form in both the total soil eDNA pool and its wa and ta fractions. Both of the eDNAss fractions (linear and circular) were characterized by small fragments."
https://openalex.org/W3000210894,"Although many studies have documented the effects of demographic bottlenecks on the genetic diversity of natural populations, there is conflicting evidence of the roles that genetic drift and selection may play in driving changes in genetic variation at adaptive loci. We analyzed genetic variation at microsatellite and mitochondrial loci in conjunction with an adaptive MHC class II locus in the Galápagos penguin (Spheniscus mendiculus), a species that has undergone serial demographic bottlenecks associated with El Niño events through its evolutionary history. We compared levels of variation in the Galápagos penguin to those of its congener, the Magellanic penguin (Spheniscus magellanicus), which has consistently maintained a large population size and thus was used as a non-bottlenecked control. The comparison of neutral and adaptive markers in these two demographically distinct species allowed assessment of the potential role of balancing selection in maintaining levels of MHC variation during bottleneck events. Our analysis suggests that the lack of genetic diversity at both neutral and adaptive loci in the Galápagos penguin likely resulted from its restricted range, relatively low abundance, and history of demographic bottlenecks. The Galápagos penguin revealed two MHC alleles, one mitochondrial haplotype, and six alleles across five microsatellite loci, which represents only a small fraction of the diversity detected in Magellanic penguins. Despite the decreased genetic diversity in the Galápagos penguin, results revealed signals of balancing selection at the MHC, which suggest that selection can mitigate some of the effects of genetic drift during bottleneck events. Although Galápagos penguin populations have persisted for a long time, increased frequency of El Niño events due to global climate change, as well as the low diversity exhibited at immunological loci, may put this species at further risk of extinction."
https://openalex.org/W3000576401,"Cardiac dysautonomia is a common nonmotor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD) associated with loss of sympathetic innervation to the heart and decreased plasma catecholamines. Disease-modifying strategies for PD cardiac neurodegeneration are not available, and biomarkers of target engagement are lacking. Systemic administration of the catecholaminergic neurotoxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) recapitulates PD cardiac dysautonomia pathology. We recently used positron emission tomography (PET) to visualize and quantify cardiac sympathetic innervation, oxidative stress, and inflammation in adult male rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta; n = 10) challenged with 6-OHDA (50mg/kg; i.v.). Twenty-four hours post-intoxication, the animals were blindly and randomly assigned to receive daily doses of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist pioglitazone (n = 5; 5mg/kg p.o.) or placebo (n = 5). Quantification of PET radioligand uptake showed increased oxidative stress and inflammation one week after 6-OHDA which resolved to baseline levels by twelve weeks, at which time pioglitazone-treated animals showed regionally preserved sympathetic innervation. Here we report post mortem characterization of heart and adrenal tissue in these animals compared to age and sex matched normal controls (n = 5). In the heart, 6-OHDA-treated animals showed a significant loss of sympathetic nerve fibers density (tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive fibers). The anatomical distribution of markers of sympathetic innervation (TH) and inflammation (HLA-DR) significantly correlated with respective in vivo PET findings across left ventricle levels and regions. No changes were found in alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Additionally, CD36 protein expression was increased at the cardiomyocyte intercalated discs following PPARγ-activation compared to placebo and control groups. Systemic 6-OHDA decreased adrenal medulla expression of catecholamine producing enzymes (TH and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase) and circulating levels of norepinephrine, which were attenuated by PPARγ-activation. Overall, these results validate in vivo PET findings of cardiac sympathetic innervation, oxidative stress, and inflammation and illustrate cardiomyocyte CD36 upregulation as a marker of PPARγ target engagement."
https://openalex.org/W2998197005,"Parkinson's disease (PD) patients treated with pramipexole (PPX) and ropinirole (ROP) exhibit a higher risk of developing impulse control disorders (ICDs), including gambling disorder, compulsive shopping, and hypersexuality. The management of ICDs in PD is challenging, due to the limited availability of effective therapeutic alternatives or counteractive strategies. Here, we used a pharmacoepidemiological approach to verify whether the risk for PPX/ROP-associated ICDs in PD patients was reduced by drugs that have been posited to exert therapeutic effects on idiopathic ICDs-including atypical antipsychotics (AAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and glutamatergic modulators (GMs).To quantify the strength of the associations between PPX/ROP and other medications with respect to ICD risk, odds ratios (ORs) were calculated by multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for age, gender, marital status race, psychiatric comorbidities, and use of cabergoline and levodopa.A total of 935 patients were included in the analysis. Use of GMs, SSRIs, and AAs was not associated with a decreased ICD risk in PD patients treated with PPX/ROP; conversely, ICD risk was significantly increased in patients treated with either GMs (Adjusted Odds Ratio, ORa: 14.00 [3.58-54.44]) or SSRIs (ORa: 3.67 [1.07-12.59]). Results were inconclusive for AAs, as available data were insufficient to compute a reliable ORa.These results suggest that some of the key pharmacological strategies used to treat idiopathic ICD may not be effective for ICDs associated with PPX and ROP in PD patients. Future studies with larger cohorts are needed to confirm, validate, and extend these findings."
https://openalex.org/W2999741265,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fatigue induced by repeated sprint in the kicking accuracy and velocity in female soccer players. Eighteen Under-23 female soccer players from a Spanish professional club were subjected to a fatigue protocol based on a repeated-sprint ability (RSA) test. Measurements of the kicking velocity (maximal ball velocity) and accuracy (Loughborough Soccer Shooting Test) were taken before and after fatigue induction. Correlations between the change in the maximal ball velocity/accuracy and the heart rate (HR), the fatigue index (FI), the sprint decrement (Sdec) and the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were made. There was a significant difference between maximal ball velocity under fatigue conditions with respect to non-fatigue conditions (p = 0.001; ES = 0.89). However, despite a lower kicking accuracy punctuation with fatigue, this was not statistically significant (p = 0.433; ES = 0.22). Significant correlations were found between the maximal kicking velocity and the FI (r = 0.632, p < 0.01) and the Sdec (r = -0.554, p < 0.05) and between the kicking accuracy and the RPE (r = -0.506, p < 0.05). In conclusion, there was a significant reduction in the maximal kicking velocity, but not in the kicking accuracy, under fatigued conditions. The RSA-related FI and Sdec were the best predictors of the maximal kicking velocity and the RPE for the kicking accuracy."
https://openalex.org/W3000069826,"Chronic wasting disease is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy of cervids. This fatal neurodegenerative disease is caused by misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC) to pathogenic conformers (PrPSc), and the pathogenic forms accumulate in the brain and other tissues. Real-time Quaking Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) can be used for the detection of prions and for prion strain discrimination in a variety of biological tissues from humans and animals. In this study, we evaluated how either PrPSc from cervids of different genotypes or PrPSc from different sources of CWD influence the fibril formation of recombinant bank vole (BV) or human prion proteins using RT-QuIC. We found that reaction mixtures seeded with PrPSc from different genotypes of white-tailed deer or reindeer brains have similar conversion efficiency with both substrates. Also, we observed similar results when assays were seeded with different sources of CWD. Thus, we conclude that the genotypes of all sources of CWD used in this study do not influence the level of conversion of PrPC to PrPSc."
https://openalex.org/W3000711808,"Several starfish (Echinodermata, Asteroidea) are keystone species of marine ecosystems, but some of the species are difficult to identify using morphological criteria only. The common sunstar, Crossaster papposus (Linnaeus, 1767), is a conspicuous species with a wide circumboreal distribution. In 1900, a closely similar species, C. squamatus (Döderlein, 1900) was described from the NE Atlantic Ocean, but subsequent authors have differed in their views on whether this is a valid taxon or rather an ecotype associated with temperature variations. We assessed the differentiating morphological characters of specimens from Norwegian and Greenland waters identified as C. papposus and C. squamatus and compared their distributions in the NE Atlantic as inferred from research cruises. The field data show that C. papposus is found mainly in temperate and shallow waters, whereas C. squamatus resides on the shelf-break in colder, mixed water masses. Intraspecific diversity and interspecific genetic differentiation of the two putative species, and their phylogenetic relationships to several Crossaster congeners worldwide, were explored using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences. The molecular evidence suggests that C. papposus is the more diverse and geographically structured taxon, in line with its wide distribution. C. papposus and C. squamatus are closely related, yet clearly distinct taxa, while C. papposus and C. multispinus H.L. Clark, 1916, the latter from the South Pacific Ocean, are closely related, possibly sister taxa."
https://openalex.org/W2999062136,"Purpose Multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in urinary tract infection (UTI) has spread worldwide; one cause is overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents such as fluoroquinolone antibacterials. To improve antimicrobial agent administration, this study aimed to calculate a probability prediction formula to predict the organism strain causing UTI in real time from dip-stick testing and flow cytometry. Methodology We examined 372 outpatient spot urine samples with observed pyuria and bacteriuria using dip-stick testing and flow cytometry. We performed multiple logistic-regression analysis on the basis of 11 measurement items and BACT scattergram analysis with age and sex as explanatory variables and each strain as the response variable and calculated a probability prediction formula. Results The best prediction formula for discrimination of the bacilli group and cocci or polymicrobial group was a model with 5 explanatory variables that included percentage of scattergram dots in an angular area of 0–25° (P<0.001), sex (P<0.001), nitrite (P = 0.002), and ketones (P = 0.133). For a predicted cut-off value of Y = 0.395, sensitivity was 0.867 and specificity was 0.775 (cross-validation group: sensitivity = 0.840, specificity = 0.760). The best prediction formula for P. mirabilis and other bacilli was a model with percentage of scattergram dots in an angular area of 0–20° (P<0.001) and nitrite (P = 0.090). For a predicted cut-off value of Y = 0.064, sensitivity was 0.889 and specificity was 0.788 (cross-validation group: sensitivity = 1.000, specificity = 0.766). Conclusion Simultaneous use of the calculated probability prediction formula with urinalysis results facilitates real-time prediction of organisms causing UTI, thus providing helpful information for empiric therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2999064254,"As the resources for road safety in developing countries are scarce and unevenly distributed, vulnerable road users -such as the elderly- may be particularly at risk of road traffic deaths. To date, the impact of road safety measures over the rate of road traffic deaths in older adults (60 years or older), considering the within-country socioeconomic inequalities, has not been explored in developing nations. This study takes the Chilean case as an example -with its 2005 traffic law reform as one of the road safety measures investigated-, in which open data available from official national sources for all its 13 regions over the 2002–2013 period were used for a multilevel interrupted time-series analysis. A statistically significant secular reduction of the rates of road traffic deaths in the elderly population was found (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.91 to 0.99), but no evidence for a significant intercept or slope change after the traffic law reform was observed. Regions with the highest number of traffic offenses prosecuted in local police courts had lower rates of road traffic deaths in older adults (IRR 0.95, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.00), and those regions in the third (IRR 1.61, 95% CI 1.16 to 2.25) and the fifth (IRR 1.66, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.54) quintiles of socioeconomic deprivation had higher rates of road traffic deaths in the elderly. Such findings strongly support the conceptualization of the road safety of seniors in developing countries as a social equity issue, with implications for the design of traffic regulations and road environments."
https://openalex.org/W2999687979,"Adenoviruses are double-strained DNA viruses found in a great number of vertebrates, including humans. In order to understand their transmission dynamics, it is crucial, even from a human health perspective, to investigate how host traits influence their prevalence. Bats are important reservoirs for adenoviruses, and here we use the results of recent screenings in Western Europe to evaluate the association between characteristic traits of bat species and their probability of hosting adenoviruses, taking into account their phylogenetic relationships. Across species, we found an important phylogenetic component in the presence of adenoviruses and mating strategy as the most determinant factor conditioning the prevalence of adenoviruses across bat species. Contrary to other more stable mating strategies (e.g. harems), swarming could hinder transmission of adenoviruses since this strategy implies that contacts between individuals are too short. Alternatively, bat species with more promiscuous behavior may develop a stronger immune system. Outstandingly high prevalence of adenoviruses was reported for the Iberian species Pipistrellus pygmaeus, P. kuhlii and Nyctalus lasiopterus and we found that in the latter, males were more likely to be infected by adenoviruses than females, due to the immunosuppressing consequence of testosterone during the mating season. As a general trend across species, we found that the number of adenoviruses positive individuals was different across localities and that the difference in prevalence between populations was correlated with their geographic distances for two of the three studied bat species (P. pygmaeus and P.kuhlii). These results increase our knowledge about the transmission mechanisms of adenoviruses."
https://openalex.org/W2999229865,"Background Therapeutic Hypothermia (TH) is a standard of care after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Previous reports failed to prove a significant benefit for survival or neurological outcomes. We examined whether the proper selection of patients would enhance treatment efficacy. Method We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data was collected from January 2000 and August 2018. Patients were enrolled after OHCA and classified into two groups, patients treated with TH and patients who were not treated with TH. Results A total of 92 patients were included in the study. 57 (63%) patients were in the TH Group and 34 (37%) in the Non-TH group. There was no statistical difference in favorable neurological outcomes between the groups. Patients presenting with ventricular fibrillation had a higher 1-year survival rate from TH, while patients with asystole were found to benefit only if they were younger than 65 years (p < .007, p < .02, respectively). Conclusion Therapeutic Hypothermia patients failed to demonstrate a significant benefit in terms of improved neurological outcomes. Patients treated with TH following ventricular fibrillation experienced the most benefit in terms of 1-year survival, while patients who had suffered from asystole experienced a modest benefit only if they were younger than 65 years of age. Guidelines should address age and primary arrhythmia for proper treatment selection."

https://openalex.org/W3000625835,"The number of people who use computers for business and personal purposes increases as technology grows. The application of ergonomic practices on computer workstations reduces the musculoskeletal discomfort experienced and increases the overall satisfaction of the users. Keyboards are available in various systems, from computers to mobile devices, and have difference shapes and sizes. The keyboard size and shape is known to influence the user's upper extremities. Alternative keyboard designs help diminish the pain in the arms that occurs due to awkward arm postures. Most previous studies tried to optimize the keyboard layout based on ergonomic typing and the frequency of letters' co-occurrence. This research considers the frequency of the appearance of the most used 3,000 words in the English language. First, the frequency of each letter pair is calculated by the Text Analyzer. Then, a genetic algorithm is applied to design an ergonomically optimized keyboard to minimize the total distance of finger travel among the selected alphanumeric characters. The results showed that the distance travelled obtained by the proposed keyboard layout is less than that for the QWERTY keyboard in all different types of texts, in which an average of 6.04% improvement was achieved. Therefore, the proposed design can be used for keyboards to reduce time and fatigue."
https://openalex.org/W3000366622,"There have been relatively few studies of how central synapses age in adult Drosophila melanogaster. In this study we investigate the aging of the synaptic inputs to the Giant Fiber (GF) from auditory Johnston's Organ neurons (JONs). In previously published experiments an indirect assay of this synaptic connection was used; here we describe a new, more direct assay, which allows reliable detection of the GF action potential in the neck connective, and long term recording of its responses to sound. Genetic poisoning using diphtheria toxin expressed in the GF with R68A06-GAL4 was used to confirm that this signal indeed arose from the GF and not from other descending neurons. As before, the sound-evoked action potentials (SEPs) in the antennal nerve were recorded via an electrode inserted at the base of the antenna. It was noted that an action potential in the GF elicited an antennal twitch, which in turn evoked a mechanosensory response from the JONs in the absence of sound. We then used these extracellular recording techniques in males and female of different ages to quantify the response of the JONs to a brief sound impulse, and also to measure the strength of the connection between the JONs and the GF. At no age was there any significant difference between males and females, for any of the parameters measured. The sensitivity of the JONs to a sound impulse approximately doubled between 1 d and 10 d after eclosion, which corresponds to the period when most mating is taking place. Subsequently JON sensitivity decreased with age, being approximately half as sensitive at 20 d and one-third as sensitive at 50 d, as compared to 10 d. However, the strength of the connection between the auditory input and the GF itself remained unchanged with age, although it did show some variability that could mask any small changes."
