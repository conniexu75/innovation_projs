https://openalex.org/W1967321689,"Two apolipoprotein E (apoE) receptors, the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor and apoE receptor 2 (apoER2), are also receptors for Reelin, a signaling protein that regulates neuronal migration during brain development. In the adult brain, Reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons, suggesting a potential function as a modulator of neurotransmission. ApoE receptors have been indirectly implicated in memory and neurodegenerative disorders because their ligand, apoE, is genetically associated with Alzheimer disease. We have used knockout mice to investigate the role of Reelin and its receptors in cognition and synaptic plasticity. Mice lacking either the VLDL receptor or the apoER2 show contextual fear conditioning deficits. VLDL receptor-deficient mice also have a moderate defect in long term potentiation (LTP), and apoER2 knockouts have a pronounced one. The perfusion of mouse hippocampal slices with Reelin has no effect on baseline synaptic transmission but significantly enhances LTP in area CA1. This Reelin-dependent augmentation of LTP is abolished in VLDL receptor and apoER2 knockout mice. Our results reveal a role for Reelin in controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain and suggest that both of its receptors are necessary for Reelin-dependent enhancement of synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Thus, the impairment of apoE receptor-dependent neuromodulation may contribute to cognitive impairment and synaptic loss in Alzheimer disease.

ApoE is produced by several tissues in the body including glial cells in the brain, predominantly astrocytes (2Boyles J.K. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Gebicke-Haerter P.J. Ignatius M.J. Shooter E.M.

ApoE occurs in three major isoforms in the general human population, apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4, with apoE3 being the most common isoform. In 1993 Schmechel et al. (4Schmechel D.E. Saunders A.M. Strittmatter W.J. Crain B.J. Hulette C.M. Joo S.H. Pericak-Vance M.A. Goldgaber D. Roses A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The underlying biochemical mechanism by which apoE4 predisposes its carriers to this disease is not precisely known and is under debate. One model that has been proposed by us (5Herz J. Beffert U. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) suggests that members of a family of apoE receptors that are abundantly expressed on the surface of neurons may be involved in this pathological process. Two members of this family of apoE receptors, the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) and the apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (apoER2), have been shown to participate in a neuronal signaling pathway that governs the layering of the developing cortex (6Trommsdorff M.

This pathway involves the signaling molecule Reelin, a large protein of ∼400 kDa that is secreted by Cajal-Retzius neurons during the development of the brain (7Lambert de Rouvroit C. Goffinet A.M. Adv. Anat. Embryol. Cell Biol. 1998; 150: 1-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Rice D.S. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1005-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar).

Hawkes R. Soriano P. Cooper J.A. Nature. 1997; 389: 733-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar) all result in the same phenotype, which is characterized by cerebellar dysplasia and scrambling of the neuronal layers in the neocortex. Because VLDLR and apoER2 are partially redundant in transmitting the Reelin signal to migrating neurons, only mild neuroanatomical abnormalities that do not affect neuronal connectivity in the hippocampus are present in the brains of mice that lack only one or the other of these receptors (45Drakew A. Deller T. Heimrich B. Gebhardt C. Del Turco D. Tielsch A. Förster E. Herz J. Frotscher M. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 176: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). After the fetal phase of brain development, Reelin-expressing Cajal-Retzius neurons in the subpial layer are largely replaced by Reelin-expressing GABA-ergic interneurons that are dispersed throughout the neocortex and in the hippocampus. The Reelin receptors apoER2 and VLDLR and the adaptor protein Dab1, which are all essential to Reelin signaling, remain expressed in the adult brain, but their function there remains a mystery. An association of Reelin with synapses has been reported (13Rodriguez M.A. Pesold C. Liu W.S. Kriho V. Guidotti A. Pappas G.D. Costa E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3550-3555Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), raising the possibility of a potential role in neurotransmission that might involve signaling through apoE receptors. Here we show that mice lacking the Reelin/apoE receptors VLDLR and apoER2 have pronounced defects in memory formation and long term potentiation (LTP) and that Reelin greatly enhances LTP in hippocampal slice cultures. Our results thus reveal a role for apoE receptors and for Reelin in synaptic function and the formation of long term memory, which is likely to promote the stability and maintenance of synapses in the central nervous system. Taken together with other findings (14Raber J. Wong D. Buttini M. Orth M. Bellosta S. Pitas R.E. Mahley R.W. Mucke L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10914-10919Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) that have shown apoE-induced memory impairment in transgenic mice, our data are consistent with a hypothetical model in which the promotion of memory dysfunction by apoE4 might involve an impairment of apoE receptor-dependent signaling pathways, thereby accelerating synaptic loss and the onset of dementia. ApoER2 and VLDL receptor knockout mice have been described (6Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J.

A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Control mice were either littermates or age- and sex-matched non-mutant mice of the same strain background. Mice were housed on a 12-h light/dark schedule. All experiments were performed in compliance with the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and national regulations and policies. The accelerating Rotorod test was utilized to assess overall balance and motor coordination. The test was performed on an accelerating Rotorod apparatus (Ugo Basile) with a 3-cm diameter rod starting at an initial rotation of 4 rpm and accelerating to 40 rpm over 5 min. Mice were tested for the time spent on the rod during each of four trials per day for two consecutive days. The open field domain consisted of a square area (43 × 43 cm) surrounded by Plexiglas walls with a field lighted by four overhead lights (75 watts) in a room with otherwise standard lighting. Through the use of eight photoreceptor beams on each side of the test arena, the field was divided into 16 quadrants in which the activity of an animal was determined and recorded with a personal computer-controlled Digiscan optical animal activity system (model RXYZCM-8, Omnitech Electronics). The animal was released in the center of the field and allowed to roam the open field for 30 min. Activity was recorded from the number of photobeam disruptions in each quadrant to give the total distance traveled and the vertical activity (rearing). Also, the center to total distance ratio was determined by dividing the center distance by the total distance. For the two-pairing, fear conditioning paradigm, animals were placed in the fear conditioning apparatus for 3 min, then a 30 s acoustic conditioned stimulus (CS) (white noise, 70 dB) was delivered with a 0.5-mA shock (unconditioned stimulus) applied to the floor grid during the last 2 s of the CS. Training consisted of two mild shocks paired with two conditioned stimuli with a 2-min interval between each. The stimulus strength and number of training shocks were chosen based on pilot experiments to optimize learning. For short term memory testing, mice were placed in the isolation chamber and exposed for 6 min to the same context as that used for the training (∼40 min following training). Immediately after the contextual test, mice were placed into a novel context and exposed to the CS for 3 min (∼1 h following training). For long term memory testing, both the context and the cue were performed the next day ∼24 h following training performed as described above. Learning was assessed by measuring freezing behavior (i.e. motionless position) every 5 s. The scorer of the behavioral experiments was blind in reference to animal genotype. Adult mice were sacrificed by decapitation, and the brains were rapidly removed and briefly submerged in ice-cold cutting saline (110 mm sucrose, 60 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 28 mmNaHCO3, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 5 mmd-glucose, and 0.6 mmascorbate). All solutions were saturated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2. Whole brains were then dissected on cutting solution-soaked filter paper and mounted on a glass platform resting on ice. Hippocampal slices (400 μm) were prepared on a vibratome and allowed to equilibrate in a 50% cutting saline and 50% artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution (125 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.24 mmNaH2PO4, 25 mm NaHCO3, 10 mmd-glucose, 2 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) at room temperature for a minimum of 30 min. Slices were transferred to an interface chamber supported by a nylon mesh and allowed to recover for a minimum of 1 h prior to recording. Extracellular field recordings were obtained from area CA1 stratum radiatum. Stimulation was supplied with a bipolar Teflon-coated platinum electrode, and a recording was obtained with the use of a glass microelectrode filled with artificial cerebrospinal fluid (resistance 1–4 mΩ). Tetani used to evoke CA1 LTP consisted of either 100 Hz high frequency stimulation or θ-burst stimulation (TBS). The 100-Hz stimulation protocol consisted of two trains of 100-Hz frequency stimulation for 1 s with each train separated by a 20-s interval. The θ-burst stimulation consisted of five trains of four pulses at 100 Hz with an interburst interval of 20 s. Stimulus intensities were adjusted to give pEPSPs (population excitatory postsynaptic potentials) with slopes that were ≤50% that of the maximum determined from an input/output curve. The calculated 50% maximum stimulus intensity was used for both LTP-inducing protocols. Potentiation was measured as the normalized increase of the mean pEPSP following tetanic stimulation normalized to the mean pEPSP for the duration of the baseline recording. Experimental results were obtained from those slices that exhibited stable baseline synaptic transmission for a minimum of 30 min prior to the delivery of the LTP-inducing stimulus. Reelin or control medium was diluted in oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid, and slices were perfused at 1 ml/min. Reelin-conditioned medium was harvested from cells (293 line) that had been stably transfected with a Reelin expression construct (9D'Arcangelo G. Miao G.G. Chen S.C. Soares H.D. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Nature. 1995; 374: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. After reaching confluence, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Conditioned medium was collected after 2 days, fresh medium was added, and Reelin-conditioned medium was collected again 2 days later. The medium was concentrated ∼50-fold on an Amicon concentrator under nitrogen pressure prior to use. The concentration of Reelin used in the perfusion experiments was estimated to be ∼5 nm(i.e. ∼8 × K d). Control medium was prepared in an identical manner from untransfected 293 cells. Recombinant GST-RAP was produced in Escherichia coli as described previously (16Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K., Ho, Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explore the functional significance of Reelin and its receptors apoER2 and VLDLR in the adult mouse brain, we first subjected mice lacking either of these two receptors to a variety of behavioral tests. In contrast to Reelin- or Dab1-deficient mice, which are severely ataxic because of the failure of cerebellar development (10Ware M.L. Fox J.W. Gonzalez J.L. Davis N.M. Lambert de Rouvroit C.

Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8453-8457Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) have been reported to have apparently normal coordination and motor functions. We undertook a broad based behavioral characterization designed to determine whether mice lacking the neuronal apoE receptors apoER2 or VLDLR have memory defects. The general activity and overall motor learning ability of the animals were monitored to exclude the possibility that any perceived learning deficit could be due to a physical disability such as muscle weakness or coordination defects. Coordination and motor skill acquisition were analyzed using the Rotorod test. The amount of time an animal can stay on a rotating rod is an index of its general level of coordination. Mice also improve their performance with training, which is an indicator of motor learning (17Crawley J.N. Paylor R. Horm. Behav. 1997; 31: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). VLDLR and apoER2 mutants exhibited normal motor learning over 2 days of training. No differences in total Rotorod performance were observed compared with wild-type control animals (TableI).Table IMotor learning and general activity in VLDLR and ApoER2 knockoutsRotorod testOpen field testDay 1Day 2Total distanceVertical activityCenter to total ratiocmVLDLR −/−112.7 ± 20.89178.1 ± 26.47*4781 ± 307.1*235.0 ± 38.4*0.0450 ± 0.0074Wild-type137.9 ± 32.90206.9 ± 29.392014 ± 366.149.67 ± 11.00.01000 ± 0.0025ApoER2 −/−176.9 ± 17.21247.8 ± 17.851772 ± 296.341.92 ± 12.90.01667 ± 0.0079Wild-type157.0 ± 20.00223.6 ± 20.261430 ± 178.938.00 ± 9.670.01692 ± 0.0061For Rotorod behavior the results shown are the average total time the animals remain on the rotating rod over two consecutive days.

No significant differences were seen in rotorod performance for the VLDLR or apoER2 knockouts compared to wild-type controls. General activity levels for open field behavior are evaluated by measurements of horizontal activity (total distance traveled) and vertical activity (rearing) during a 15 min test session.

An open field test was used to evaluate the behavior of apoER2-deficient mutants and littermate controls upon placement into a novel environment. General locomotor activity and exploratory behavior was evaluated by determining the distance traveled and the amount of rearing of the animal. Moreover, open field testing can be used to calculate the center to total distance ratio, revealing the center field exploration latency of the animal, which is an index of overall animal anxiety. This analysis exploits the natural tendency of mice to avoid open areas. No differences were observed for total distance traveled, vertical activity, or center to total distance between apoER2 mutants and control animals; however, VLDLR knockout mice showed increased activity in these measurements (Table I). Therefore, absence of the VLDLR results in hyperactivity but does not apparently cause the excessive anxiety in which the animals avoid the center portion of the open field altogether. We next utilized a conditioning paradigm that elicits robust associative learning using a procedure that tests both hippocampus- and amygdala-dependent learning (18Kim J.J. Rison R.A. Fanselow M.S. Behav. Neurosci. 1993; 107: 1093-1098Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 19Chen C. Kim J.J. Thompson R.F. Tonegawa S. Behav. Neurosci. 1996; 110: 1177-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). For these experiments, an aversive stimulus (in this case, a mild foot shock) is paired two times with an acoustic component (CS; white noise) in a novel context. When tested, mice exhibit marked fear in response to re-presentation of either the context or the CS when it is presented in a novel context different from the training context. The amount of fear an animal exhibits is generally measured by the freezing behavior of the animal. Enhanced freezing behavior upon replacement into the context or re-presentation of the CS is taken as an index of the animal having learned to associate the context or CS with the foot shock. We used the associative fear-conditioned learning paradigm to evaluate both short and long term memory in our knockout animals. We found that both mutant animal groups displayed similar response to training, exhibiting freezing behavior in response to a shock equal to that of the wild-type control (WT, n = 19; apoER2 −/−,n = 17; VLDLR −/−, n = 16) (Fig.1, A and B). Testing in the context 1 h following training revealed that only the VLDLR mutants exhibited significantly less freezing than littermate controls (WT, 39 ± 3.75%, n = 10; VLDLR −/−, 18 ± 3.2%, n = 10,p = 0.003). However, both the VLDL receptor (WT, 52 ± 4.5%, n = 19; VLDLR −/−, 17 ± 3.7%, n = 16, p < 0.0001) and apoER2 (WT, 43 ± 3.5%, n = 19; apoER2 −/−, 26 ± 2.5%, n = 17, p = 0.001) mutant animals exhibited significant deficits in contextual associative fear-conditioned learning when tested 24 h following training (Fig. 1, C and D). In contrast, associative learning to the cue component 1 h following training was normal in both sets of animals, and only VLDLR-deficient mice exhibited less freezing behavior at the 24-h time point (WT, 73 ± 4.1%,n = 19; VLDLR −/−, 35 ± 5.1%,n = 16, p = 0.001) (Fig. 1,E and F). The consequences observed in the shortversus the long term memory of our VLDLR- or apoER2-deficient mice suggest that each receptor appears to play a differential role in associative memory formation. The lack of a prominent deficit to the cue component is consistent with a derangement in hippocampal function (20Phillips R.G. LeDoux J.E. Behav. Neurosci. 1992; 106: 274-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (2635) Google Scholar, 21Kim J.J. Fanselow M.S. Science. 1992; 256: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1980) Google Scholar). Thus, the contextual fear conditioning deficits in the VLDLR- and apoER2-deficient mice are compatible with a role for these receptors in modulating the synaptic plasticity that underlies long term hippocampus-dependent associative learning. We therefore extended our studies to directly measure synaptic function using hippocampal slices in vitro. We used a population field recording technique to record EPSPs from area CA1 in hippocampal slices to assess synaptic transmission and short and long term potentiation in VLDLR and apoER2 mutants. The absence of VLDLR (VLDLR −/−, n = 16; WT, n = 11) or apoER2 (apoER2 −/−, n = 14; WT, n = 11) did not affect baseline synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral synapses, because the input-output functions for the stimulation of area CA1 were not different between wild-type and knockout mice (Fig.2, A and B). Thus, the synaptic connectivity in area CA1 in which these measurements were taken appeared to remain unaffected despite the subtle morphologic changes of hippocampal anatomy in apoER2-deficient mice (6Trommsdorff M. Gotthardt M. Hiesberger T. Shelton J. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Hammer R.E. Richardson J.A. Herz J. Cell. 1999; 97: 689-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1096) Google Scholar). Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) is a form of short term synaptic plasticity that is commonly held as a presynaptic phenomenon due to the residual calcium augmentation of neurotransmitter release (22Schulz P.E. Cook E.P. Johnston D. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 5325-5337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As with baseline synaptic transmission, PPF was normal in the VLDLR (VLDLR −/−, n = 16; WT, n = 11) (Fig.2 C) and apoER2 knockouts (apoER2 −/−,n = 14; WT, n = 11) (Fig.2 D), indicating that neither receptor is a component of the machinery underlying PPF at Schaffer collateral synapses. These data also suggest that short term synaptic plasticity mechanisms such as those underlying PPF are unperturbed in VLDLR- and apoER2-deficient animals. We next tested whether the hippocampal-dependent contextual fear conditioning memory defects seen in the VLDLR and apoER2 mutant mice were accompanied by a reduction in the area CA1 LTP at Schaffer collateral synapses. The time course of synaptic potentiation following two trains of 100 Hz, 1-s stimulation in the mutant strains is shown in Fig. 3. We observed a modest decrease in post-tetanic potentiation in our VLDLR deficient mice (209 ± 23%, n = 18; WT, 258 ± 11%, n = 17, p = 0.051); however, the overall magnitude of LTP of the VLDLR mutants (139 ± 3%,n = 18) was nearly identical to that of the wild-type mice (154 ± 8%, n = 17, p = 0.12, 60 min post-tetanus). In contrast, apoER2 mutants showed a strong impairment in LTP induction. In these animals there was a decay of LTP to nearly that of baseline responses (apoER2 −/−, 120 ± 6%,n = 26; WT 152 ± 5%, n = 19,p = 0.001, 60 min post-tetanus). Thus, apoER2-deficient mice exhibit an apparently normal baseline synaptic function but have a deficit in long lasting forms of synaptic plasticity. The induction and maintenance of LTP is generally regarded as an important factor in the formation and retention of memories. There are numerous examples (23Murphy K.P. Carter R.J. Lione L.A.

Thus, these results suggest that the LTP deficit in area CA1 could contribute to the memory deficits in the apoER2 knockout mice and that the modest post-tetanic potentiation decrease that is present in the VLDL receptor-deficient animals may also account at least in part for the fear conditioning deficit seen in this strain. In the first part of our studies we used genetic ablation of two apoE receptors, the VLDL receptor and the apoER2, to reveal a role for these receptors in synaptic plasticity and memory formation. As an additional control, we also used recombinant receptor associated protein (RAP), a universal inhibitor of ligand binding to LDL receptor family members. RAP is a chaperone for LDL receptor family members that prevents the premature binding of co-expressed ligands in the endoplasmic reticulum (27Bu G. Geuze H.J. Strous G.J. Schwartz A.L.

In the context of a nucleosome, H3 lysine 79 is located in close proximity with lysine 123 of histone H2B, a major site for ubiquitination by Rad6. Here we show that Rad6-mediated ubiquitination of H2B lysine 123 is important for efficient methylation of lysine 79, but not lysine 36, of histone H3. In contrast, lysine 79 methylation of H3 is not required for ubiquitination of H2B. Our study provides a new example of trans-histone regulation between modifications on different histones. In addition, it suggests that Rad6 affects telomeric silencing, at least in part, by influencing methylation of histone H3.

Histones are subjected to post-translational modifications such as acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and methylation. Methylation on specific lysine or arginine residues is carried out by distinct classes of enzymes. The CARM1/PRMT1 class of enzymes mediates arginine methylation, while the SET domain-containing enzymes mediate lysine methylation (1Zhang Y. Reinberg D.

In the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR) and related rhodopsin-like GPCRs that bind small molecules, the binding site is formed among their seven TMs in a water-accessible binding site crevice (1Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of these receptors, therefore, transduces the binding of ligands, such as biogenic amines, to the activation of intracellular G-proteins, which in turn mediate downstream signal transduction pathways. Even in peptide and glycoprotein hormone receptors, in which the binding site is formed, at least in part, by extracellular loops or by large N-terminal domains, respectively, agonist binding must still be transduced via the transmembrane segments to the intracellular G-protein-interacting regions of these receptors.Understanding the function of GPCRs at a molecular level requires an understanding of how agonist binding to the receptor is converted into receptor activation (2Gether U. Endocr. Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Google Scholar). Studies based on electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, alterations in cysteine accessibility, and engineering of metal-binding sites have altogether pointed to a key role for conformational changes of TM3 and TM6 in receptor activation (3Farrens D.L.

It has been suggested that protonation of the Asp in the highly conserved (D/E)RY motif at the cytoplasmic side of TM3 leads to release of constraining intramolecular interactions, thereby resulting in movements of TM3 and TM6 and conversion of the receptor to the active state. This hypothesis has been supported by the observation that charge-neutralizing mutations of the Asp/Glu3.49 in TM3 lead to increased agonist-independent activation of a number of GPCRs (7Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Google Scholar, 9Arnis S. Fahmy K. Hofmann K.P. Sakmar T.P. J. Biol.

We proposed that in the inactive state Arg3.50, in addition to interacting with Asp3.49, also interacts with the conserved Glu6.30 at the cytoplasmic end of TM6, and that this interaction contributes to maintaining the receptor in the inactive state by holding together the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6. Our experimental data (14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Google Scholar) together with the high-resolution structure of rhodopsin (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar) suggest that ionic interactions between Asp/Glu3.49, Arg3.50, and Glu6.30may constitute a common switch governing the activation of many rhodopsin-like receptors. Disruption of the interaction between TM3 and TM6 produces constitutive receptor activation and the extent of constitutive activation is highly correlated with the extent of conformational rearrangement in TM6 (14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Google Scholar).Experimental and computational simulation studies indicate that conformational switches in transmembrane α-helices can be generated via Pro-containing motifs that form flexible molecular hinges (16Sansom M.S. Weinstein H. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 445-451Google Scholar). Although Farrens et al. (3Farrens D.L. Altenbach C. Yang K. Hubbell W.L. Khorana H.G. Science. 1996; 274: 768-770Google Scholar) predicted that a rigid body motion of TM6 relative to TM3 was associated with the activation of rhodopsin, the movements crucial to activation may involve flexibility about the hinge formed by the highly conserved Pro in TM6 (Pro-2886.50 in β2AR) (17Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, and presumably in the β2AR, TM6 exists in a highly bent configuration, with its cytoplasmic end near to the cytoplasmic end of TM3 (15Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A., Le Trong I. Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Google Scholar).In the β2AR and related aminergic receptors, a cluster of highly conserved aromatic residues surrounding the Pro-kink, including Phe6.44, Trp6.48, Phe6.51, and Phe6.52 in catecholamine receptors, face the binding-site crevice (reviewed in Ref. 1Shi L. Javitch J.A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 437-467Google Scholar). Binding of agonist to a residue or residues in this “aromatic cluster” has been hypothesized to induce or stabilize an altered configuration of the side chains within this cluster that promotes receptor activation (17Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Google Scholar). Such a conformational rearrangement of the aromatic cluster may be associated with an alteration in the configuration of the TM6 Pro-kink and the subsequent movement of the cytoplasmic end of TM6 away from TM3.In the β2AR the conserved endogenous Cys-2856.47, positioned i-3 from the conserved Pro-2886.50, becomes accessible to methanethiosulfonate ethylammonium (MTSEA) in the binding-site crevice in constitutively active mutants (CAMs) (6Javitch J.A., Fu, D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Google Scholar, 7Rasmussen S.G. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Ghanouni P. Javitch J.A. Gether U. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 175-184Google Scholar, 14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Google Scholar). Cys, Ser, and Thr can hydrogen bond (H-bond) to the backbone in an α-helix, and this interaction may impact significantly not only the local conformation but may also lead to long range conformational changes through bends and distortions generated in the helix backbone (18Ballesteros J.A. Deupi X. Olivella M. Haaksma E.E. Pardo L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2754-2760Google Scholar, 19Gray T.M. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 75-81Google Scholar, 20McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Google Scholar). The highly conserved Cys-2856.47 near the Pro-kink at 6.50 can H-bond to different backbone carbonyls in different rotamer positions, and its rotamer position may modulate the TM6 kink.We hypothesized that the configuration of the TM6 Pro-kink in a GPCR would be correlated with constitutive activity and that both Cys6.47 and the aromatic cluster may impact this configuration. We tested these hypotheses in the β2AR by assessing the binding and activation properties of Cys6.47mutants. The biased Monte Carlo technique of Conformational Memories was used to probe for correlations between the Cys-2856.47rotamer position, the configuration of the aromatic cluster in TM6, and the TM6 Pro-kink conformation. We carried out cysteine accessibility experiments to test a prediction that arose from the simulations, and the experimental results supported the existence of a critical rotamer “toggle switch” (17Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Google Scholar) associated with receptor activation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESNumbering of Residue and Residue IndexResidues are numbered according to their positions in the human β2AR sequence. We also index residues relative to the most conserved residue in the TM in which it is located (21Ballesteros J. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Google Scholar). By definition, the most conserved residue is assigned the position index “50,” e.g. Pro-2886.50 and therefore Leu-2876.49 and Phe-2896.51. This indexing simplifies the identification of aligned residues in different GPCRs. Mutants are named as WT residue, residue number, superscript index number, and mutant residue where the residues are given in single letter codes.Nomenclature of χ1 RotamerDifferent nomenclatures have been used to describe the rotamers of side chain torsion angles. When the heavy atom at the γ position is at a position opposite to the backbone nitrogen, when viewed from β-carbon to α-carbon, we define the χ1 rotamer as in thetrans (t) position; from the same viewing angle, when the heavy atom at the γ position is at a position opposite to the backbone carbon, we define the χ1 rotamer as in thegauche+ (g+) position; when the γ-carbon is opposite to the α-hydrogen, we define the χ1 rotamer as in thegauche− (g−) position.β2-Plasmids and Site-directed MutagenesisThe mutations were generated by the polymerase chain reaction-mediated mutagenesis using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). The polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA fragments containing the mutations were subcloned into the appropriate plasmid. The mutations were identified initially through the presence of diagnostic restriction sites introduced via the mutated oligonucleotides and subsequently verified by DNA sequencing analysis of the polymerase chain reaction-generated segments. For stable expression in HEK 293 cells, this cDNA was subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pCIN4-SFβ2AR6His (22Liapakis G. Ballesteros J.A. Papachristou S. Chan W.C. Chen X. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37779-37788Google Scholar).Cell Culture and TransfectionHEK 293 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (1:1) containing 3.15 g/liter of glucose in 10% bovine calf serum. The HEK 293 cells were transfected with 2 μg of the pCIN4 constructs using the LipofectAMINE/Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) transfection system, and a stably transfected pool was selected with Geneticin (700 μg/ml) (6Javitch J.A., Fu, D. Liapakis G. Chen J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18546-18549Google Scholar).Membrane Preparation and [3H]CGP-12177 BindingTo increase the expression of the constitutively active mutant, a 10 μm concentration of the inverse agonist sotalol was added to the growth medium of HEK 293 cells stably expressing WT or mutant β2AR for 1–2 days. Membranes were prepared as described previously (14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Google Scholar). Aliquots of diluted membrane suspension (200 μl) were incubated in binding buffer either with six different concentrations of the antagonist [3H]CGP-12177 between 40 and 1100 pm (in saturation binding experiments) or with increasing concentrations of agonists or antagonists in the presence of 100 pm [3H]CGP-12177 (in competition binding experiments). The total volume was adjusted to 1.0 ml, and the binding experiments and data analysis were performed as described previously (22Liapakis G. Ballesteros J.A. Papachristou S. Chan W.C. Chen X. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37779-37788Google Scholar, 23Staehelin M. Simons P. Jaeggi K. Wigger N. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3496-3502Google Scholar).cAMP Accumulation AssayHEK 293 cells stably expressing the WT β2AR or the mutants were plated in 96-well cell culture plates (pretreated with poly-l-lysine, 0.1 mg/ml) at a density of 40,000–60,000 cells/well. After incubation overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2, the cells were 95–100% confluent. The medium was removed, and 100 μl of 0–60 μm N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroquinoline (EEDQ) in Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) was added to normalize the concentration of receptor (22Liapakis G. Ballesteros J.A. Papachristou S. Chan W.C. Chen X. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37779-37788Google Scholar). The concentration of EEDQ used for a particular experiment was adjusted based on the level of cell surface expression of the particular mutant, as higher expressing receptors such as WT required higher concentrations of EEDQ for appropriate normalization. The level of cell surface expression of WT and the mutants was determined by specific binding of the hydrophilic radioligand [3H]CGP-12177 at a concentration 10-fold higher than itsK D (0.9 nm). cAMP accumulation assay was performed as described previously (22Liapakis G. Ballesteros J.A. Papachristou S. Chan W.C. Chen X. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37779-37788Google Scholar).Reactions of F2906.52C Mutants with MTS ReagentsWhole cells from a 35-mm dish were resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A. Aliquots (50 μl) of cell suspension were incubated with freshly prepared MTSEA (Toronto Research Biochemicals) at the stated concentrations at room temperature for 2 min. Cell suspensions were then diluted 20-fold, and 300-μl aliquots were used to assay for [3H]CGP-12177 (1.2 nm) binding in triplicate as described above. The fractional inhibition was calculated as 1-[(specific binding after MTS reagent)/(specific binding without reagent)].Rotamer Statistics of Cys/Ser/Thr of Membrane ProteinsThe distributions of the χ1 rotamer of Cys/Ser/Thr were calculated from all the high resolution (≤3 Å) membrane protein structures currently available. The structures were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank. The list and definitions of transmembrane α-helical segments were updated and modified using the Membrane Protein Topology data base (24Jayasinghe S. Hristova K. White S.H. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 455-458Google Scholar). Cys/Ser/Thr in transmembrane α-helical segments were only included if at least 5 residues N-terminal to the identified position were within the α-helix. Only regions with a B-value ≤40 (25Word J.M. Lovell S.C. LaBean T.H. Taylor H.C. Zalis M.E. Presley B.K. Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1711-1733Google Scholar) and structures with a resolution ≤3 Å were included in the analysis. Our rationale was that a resolution ≤3 Å can differentiate whether or not a region is α-helical and B-values ≤40 of the Cys/Ser/Thr side chain atoms ensure that coordinate information was reliable.Conformational MemoriesThe approach of Conformational Memories, which is a two-phase biased Monte Carlo simulation, was described previously (26Guarnieri F. Wilson S.R. J. Comp. Chem. 1995; 16: 648-653Google Scholar). We used this algorithm, which was implemented in CHARMM (27Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comp. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Google Scholar), to probe the conformational space of TM6 of human β2AR.Initial StructuresThe template was TM6 (6.40–6.56) of chain A of the bovine rhodopsin structure (Protein Data Bank number1HZX). The side chains of the residues were mutated to those of the aligned positions in the human β2AR. Four Ala residues in a standard α-helical conformation were added at the N and C termini. Thus, there are totally 25 residues in the system. The α-helix was capped by acetamide at the N terminus andN-methylamide at the C terminus. χ1 of 6.47 (Cys/Ser/Thr) was manually placed in gauche+(g+), gauche− (g−), ortrans (t). χ1 of 6.48 and 6.52 were manually placed in g+ or t, and ing+/g+, g+/t, andt/t combinations (see “Results”). The initial structures were energy minimized by CHARMM (27b1). During the minimization, the backbone atoms were harmonically constrained with a force constant of 10, and the χ1 of the 6.47, 6.48, and 6.52 side chains were constrained by well shaped energy barriers around a specific rotamer.Biased (Constrained) Exploring PhaseIn the initial conformational memories, the backbone angles (ϕ and ψ) of 6.44–6.52 were distributed with ±50° freedom from the rhodopsin structure values (10% in each of the designated 10° buckets); those of 6.40–6.43 and 6.53–6.56 were distributed within ±25° freedom (20% at each of designated 10° buckets). The dihedral angles of the alanines in the N and C termini were set to those of a standard α-helix (ϕ = −65° ψ = −40°). Side chain torsion angles were able to freely rotate except for the χ1 of 6.47. The χ1 of 6.47 (Cys/Ser/Thr) was constrained to g+, g−, or t as specified under “Results.”Forty runs of Monte Carlo simulated annealing were carried out within the above defined conformational memories, with a distance dependent dielectric with a coefficient of 2. Each run of Monte Carlo simulated annealing consisted of a walk from 2070 to 310 K in 18 temperature intervals with a cooling schedule ofT n+1 = 0.9 T n, and 25,000 steps per temperature. At each step, 2 dihedral angles were randomly selected to change within the allowed conformational memories, and the trial conformation was accepted or rejected according to the standard Metropolis criteria with a Boltzmann probability function defined at the given temperature.Biased Sampling PhaseSeveral hundred structures were collected for each combination of χ1 of 6.47, 6.48, and 6.52 (see “Results”), based on the biased conformational memories created by the biased (constrained) exploration phase. Each structure was generated after a run of biased Monte Carlo simulated annealing. Each run in this phase consisted of a walk of 15,000 steps at 310 K. At each step, 2 dihedral angles were randomly selected to change within the output conformational memories from the biased exploring phase. Difference structures were generated by changing the odd random number seed.Analysis of the Output Simulation StructuresThe resulting simulation structures were first classified according to their χ1 rotamer positions of 6.48 and 6.52 (see “Results”). For each structure in each group, the corresponding coordinates were extracted to calculate the following parameters: the ϕ and ψ of 6.44–6.52 and their individual averages for each group; the population distribution of χ1 of 6.44, 6.47, 6.48, 6.51, and 6.52; the distances between the atoms at the γ position of Cys/Ser/Thr (6.47) to the carboxyl oxygen at i−3 (6.44) andi−4 (6.43) and the average for each group.The Pro-kink can be described with bend angle, wobble angle, and face shift (28Visiers I. Braunheim B.B. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 603-606Google Scholar). To assess the configuration across the Pro-kink rather than only the configuration N-terminal to the Pro, we have defined the face shift differently from Visiers et al. (28Visiers I. Braunheim B.B. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 603-606Google Scholar). We used the angle between the projection of the average of the vectors connecting the α-carbons of the (i−3) and (i−4) amino acids with the origin in the y,z-plane (A−34) and the projection of the average of the vectors connecting the α-carbons of the (i+3) and (i+4) amino acids with the origin in the y,z-plane, instead of the angle between A−34 and the projection of the vector connecting the proline α-carbon with origin in they,z-plane in Ref. 28Visiers I. Braunheim B.B. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 603-606Google Scholar. The transformation of the coordinates was similar to Visiers et al. (28Visiers I. Braunheim B.B. Weinstein H. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 603-606Google Scholar). The calculation was implemented in a Perl script that automatically calls CHARMM to calculate the helix axis and extract the results from the output.The output simulation structures were clustered using Macromodel/Xcluster. Representative structures and the largest clusters were selected for illustration and these were superimposed on the backbone atoms of 6.49 to 6.60 (extracellular region).DISCUSSIONInteractions at the cytoplasmic ends of TM3 and TM6 constrain the relative mobility of these segments in the inactive state of the β2AR and related rhodopsin-like receptors (14Ballesteros J.A. Jensen A.D. Liapakis G. Rasmussen S.G. Shi L. Gether U. Javitch J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29171-29177Google Scholar). Upon release of this “ionic lock” the mobility of TM6 and its position relative to TM3 may be modulated by the configuration of its Pro-kink. If, as we hypothesized, the rotamer position of 6.47 modulates the TM6 Pro-kink, then because the β-branched Thr does not populate thet rotamer, C2856.47T should favor conformations of the receptor driven by the g+ rotamer, and destabilize those conformations driven by the t rotamer. Because Ser can exist in the t rotamer with a roughly similar frequency as Cys, C2856.47S would be expected to resemble WT receptor in its activation properties.We found that C2856.47T had multiple properties of a CAM: it had a higher basal level of cAMP accumulation, it had a higher basal level of cAMP in the presence of forskolin, it had a lower EC50 for agonist stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, basal and forskolin-stimulated basal activity was reduced substantially by the inverse agonist timolol, and it had higher affinity for agonist in competition binding studies. Therefore, C2856.47T has the classical characteristics of a CAM, in which a greater fraction of receptor is present in the active state (31Samama P. Cotecchia S. Costa T. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4625-4636Google Scholar, 33Gether U. Ballesteros J.A. Seifert R. Sanders-Bush E. Weinstein H. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2587-2590Google Scholar). In contrast, C2856.47S had properties similar to that of WT.Conformational Memories revealed that the rotamer conformations at positions 6.47, 6.48, and 6.52 around Pro6.50 are correlated. A change of 6.48 from g+ (its conformation in the rhodopsin inactive state structure), to t, must be accompanied by a corresponding change of 6.52 to t to avoid steric clash (Fig. 3 A). On the other hand, a change of Phe6.52 from t to g+ must be accompanied by a corresponding change of 6.48 to g+ to avoid the same steric clash. Thus in the β2AR and related rhodopsin-like receptors these two residues may act in concert as part of a rotamer toggle switch that transduces agonist binding into an altered conformation of TM6 (17Visiers I. Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 343: 329-371Google Scholar). The aromatic stacking interactions between Trp6.48 and Phe6.52 may stabilize theg+/g+ and t/t rotamer configurations. These favorable interactions between 6.48 and 6.52 are facilitated by the presence of the Pro-kink, which brings these two residues closer to each other, altering the relationship between these two side chains from what would be much less favorable interactions in a standard α-helix (data not shown).We also found that the rotamer conformation of 6.47 was significantly correlated with the rotamer of 6.48, making 6.47 a critical part of the rotamer toggle switch. Specifically, 6.47 in g+ was associated with 6.48 in t, and 6.47 in t was associated with 6.48 in g+ (Table III). We propose that the impact of mutation of 6.47 to Thr on activation results from both altered H-bonding as well as modulation by the 6.47 side chain of the rotamer toggle switch. Thus, we propose that Cys6.47 g+/Trp6.48 t/Phe6.52 trepresents the active state and that Cys6.47 t/Trp6.48 g+/Phe6.52 g+ represents the inactive state. With Trp6.48 in tin the active state, Phe6.52 must also be in tto avoid steric clash. In contrast, as discussed above, with Trp6.48 in g+ in the inactive state, although there is an increased propensity for 6.52 to be in g+, 6.52 may also exist in t, suggesting the possibility of a diversity of inactive states, with the rotamer positions of 6.47 and 6.48 being more critical to its phenotype.This hypothesis is consistent with a number of experimental results in rhodopsin. Movement of the side chain of Trp6.48 fromg+ to t upon activation is consistent with the inference from UV absorption spectrometry in rhodopsin that the indole side chain of Trp-2656.48 changes orientation during the inactive to active conformational transition (34Lin S.W. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11149-11159Google Scholar) as well as with data suggesting that a single Trp tilts toward the membrane during activation (35Chabre M. Breton J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1979; 30: 295-299Google Scholar).Although 6.52 is an alanine in rhodopsin, in the inactive rhodopsin structure the β-ionone ring and carbon chain of retinal interact with 6.48 in g+ in a configuration very similar to that of the interaction of 6.48 in g+ with Phe6.52 ing+ in the β2AR (Fig.5). Photoisomerization of retinal fromcis to trans moves the β-ionone ring toward TM4 (36Borhan B. Souto M.L. Imai H. Shichida Y. Nakanishi K. Science. 2000; 288: 2209-2212Google Scholar) and thus away from Trp6.48, whose enhanced freedom and subsequent rearrangement is involved in the activation mechanism of rhodopsin. The exquisite lack of constitutive activity of rhodopsin may result from the inability of 6.48 to move to the t rotamer when constrained by bound 11-cis-retinal. For GPCRs, such as the β2AR, which are activated by diffusible ligands, a ligand that stabilizes Trp6.48 in the g+conformation would, therefore, behave as an inverse agonist. One such mechanism of inverse agonism may involve forcing or stabilizing Phe6.52 into the g+ rotamer conformation, which would in turn force Trp6.48 into the g+conformation, and thereby promote the inactive state. Conversely, an agonist that stabilizes Phe6.52 in the t rotamer conformation would free Trp6.48 to adopt the tconformation, and thereby promote the active state.FTIR difference spectroscopy has been used to study the role of cysteine residues in the photoactivation of rhodopsin (37Rath P. Bovee-Geurts P.H. DeGrip"
https://openalex.org/W1982584027,"Microvascular permeability is mediated by (i) the caveolar transcytosis of molecules across endothelial cells and (ii) the paracellular movement of ions and nutrients. Recently, we derived Cav-1 (−/−) knock-out mice using standard homologous recombination techniques. These mice are viable but show a loss of endothelial cell caveolae and striking defects in caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Thus, a compensatory mechanism must be operating in these mice. One possible compensatory response would be an increase in the paracellular pathway, resulting in increased microvascular permeability. To test this hypothesis directly, we studied the microvascular permeability of Cav-1 null mice using a variety of complementary in vivo approaches. Radio-iodinated bovine serum albumin was injected into Cav-1-deficient mice, and its rate of clearance from the circulatory system was compared with that of wild type control mice. Our results indicate that iodinated bovine serum albumin is removed from the circulatory system of Cav-1-deficient mice at a substantially faster rate. To determine whether this defect is restricted to the paracellular movement of albumin, lungs from Cav-1-deficient mice were next perfused with the electron dense dye Ruthenium Red. Micrographs of lung endothelial cells from Cav-1-deficient mice demonstrate that the paracellular movement of Ruthenium Red is dramatically increased. In addition, electron micrographs of Cav-1-deficient lung capillaries reveal defects in tight junction morphology and abnormalities in capillary endothelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane. This defect in cell-substrate attachment is consistent with the postulated role of caveolin-1 in positively regulating integrin signaling. Because loss of caveolin-1 expression results in constitutive activation of eNOS activity, we also examined whether these increases in microvascular permeability are NO-dependent. Interestingly, treatment with l-NAME (a well established nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor) successfully reversed the microvascular hyperpermeability phenotype of Cav-1 knock-out mice. Thus, caveolin-1 plays a dual regulatory role in controlling microvascular permeability: (i) as a structural protein that is required for caveolae formation and caveolar transcytosis and (ii) as a tonic inhibitor of eNOS activity to negatively regulate the paracellular pathway. Microvascular permeability is mediated by (i) the caveolar transcytosis of molecules across endothelial cells and (ii) the paracellular movement of ions and nutrients. Recently, we derived Cav-1 (−/−) knock-out mice using standard homologous recombination techniques. These mice are viable but show a loss of endothelial cell caveolae and striking defects in caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Thus, a compensatory mechanism must be operating in these mice. One possible compensatory response would be an increase in the paracellular pathway, resulting in increased microvascular permeability.

Radio-iodinated bovine serum albumin was injected into Cav-1-deficient mice, and its rate of clearance from the circulatory system was compared with that of wild type control mice. Our results indicate that iodinated bovine serum albumin is removed from the circulatory system of Cav-1-deficient mice at a substantially faster rate. To determine whether this defect is restricted to the paracellular movement of albumin, lungs from Cav-1-deficient mice were next perfused with the electron dense dye Ruthenium Red. Micrographs of lung endothelial cells from Cav-1-deficient mice demonstrate that the paracellular movement of Ruthenium Red is dramatically increased. In addition, electron micrographs of Cav-1-deficient lung capillaries reveal defects in tight junction morphology and abnormalities in capillary endothelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane. This defect in cell-substrate attachment is consistent with the postulated role of caveolin-1 in positively regulating integrin signaling. Because loss of caveolin-1 expression results in constitutive activation of eNOS activity, we also examined whether these increases in microvascular permeability are NO-dependent. Interestingly, treatment with l-NAME (a well established nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor) successfully reversed the microvascular hyperpermeability phenotype of Cav-1 knock-out mice. Thus, caveolin-1 plays a dual regulatory role in controlling microvascular permeability: (i) as a structural protein that is required for caveolae formation and caveolar transcytosis and (ii) as a tonic inhibitor of eNOS activity to negatively regulate the paracellular pathway. nitric-oxide synthase endothelial NOS bovine serum albumin caveolin-1 scaffolding domain Vascular endothelial cells form a continuous and semipermeable barrier that is responsible for maintaining the homeostatic regulation of fluid balance between the circulatory system and surrounding tissues. These cells also regulate vascular permeability to plasma proteins and various cells within the blood. Vascular endothelial cells have two different mechanisms that appear to act in concert to control vascular permeability. The first mechanism is the paracellular (between cells) pathway, first reported by Majno and Palade in 1961 (1Majno G. Palade G. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 11: 571-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in which transported material passes across endothelial tight junctions. The second mechanism is via the transcytotic (through cells) pathway (2Predescu D. Palade G.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: H725-H733PubMed Google Scholar), in which transported material is taken up by the endothelial cell from the apical surface, transported across the cell, and released at the basolateral surface. This latter pathway is mediated by caveolae organelles, which are also known as plasmalemmal vesicles. Caveolae, 50–100-nm vesicular invaginations of the plasma membrane, were first described morphologically in the 1950s by Yamada (3Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and Farquhar and Palade (4Farquhar M. Palade G. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar) and are most abundant in endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Caveolae have been implicated in vesicular permeability since the 1950s because of their role in the fluid phase transcytosis of both large and small molecules across endothelial cells (3Yamada E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1955; 1: 445-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 4Farquhar M. Palade G. J. Cell Biol. 1963; 17: 375-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Caveolin-1, a 21–24-kDa integral membrane protein, is a principal component of caveolar membranes (5Glenney Jr., J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20163-20166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Glenney Jr., J.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that caveolin-1 acts as a scaffolding protein to concentrate and organize specific lipids, such as sphingolipids and cholesterol (7Fra A.M. Williamson E. Simons K. Parton R.G.

Interestingly, endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS)1 is also lipid-modified, targets to caveolae membranes, and interacts directly with caveolin-1. In addition, interaction of caveolin-1 with eNOS inhibits its catalytic activity, thereby preventing NO production (13Bucci M. Gratton J.P. Rudic R.D. Acevedo L. Roviezzo F. Cirino G. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). NO and its endothelial-specific synthase (eNOS) are important signaling molecules in determining the action of various vasomediators in the control of vascular permeability (14Lal B.K. Varma S. Pappas P.J. Hobson II, R.W. Duran W.N. Microvasc. Res. 2001; 62: 252-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Hood J.D. Meininger C.J. Ziche M. Granger H.J. Am. J.

Although the role of eNOS and NO in vascular permeability has been widely studied through the use of eNOS inhibitors to block permeability and NO donors to accentuate these effects (18Inoue H. Ando K. Wakisaka N. Matsuaki K. Aihara M. Kumagai N. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 2001; 5: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Hinder F. Booke M. Traber L.D. Traber D.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 1997; 83: 1941-1946Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the exact mechanism by which eNOS and NO regulate vascular permeability remains unclear. However, one possible mechanism through which NO can influence vascular permeability is via the regulation of endothelial cell shape and intercellular junction formation (20Lum H. Malik A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: L223-L241Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Garcia J.G. Schaphorst K.L. J. Investig. Med. 1995; 43: 117-126PubMed Google Scholar). In support of this model, pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell adhesion is regulated by NO (22Tsukahara H. Noiri E. Jiang M.Z. Hiraoka M. Mayumi M. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of caveolin-1 in the regulation of endothelial cell permeability may be 2-fold. First, caveolin-1 expression drives caveolae formation, thereby directly regulating the capacity of the endothelial cell for transporting molecules such as albumin via caveolar transcytosis. Second, caveolin-1 may indirectly regulate the paracellular pathway via its ability to tonically inhibit eNOS, preventing NO production. Recently, we have generated Cav-1-deficient mice (23Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G., Li, M. Pestell R.G., Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38121-38138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Interestingly, these mice are viable and fertile despite a loss of caveolae organelles in the cell types where the caveolin-1 protein is normally expressed. We have shown that both fibroblasts and endothelial cells derived from Cav-1 null mice are incapable of endocytosing albumin (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), an abundant serum protein. Albumin is normally transported across endothelial cells via caveolar transcytosis (25Ghitescu L. Fixman A. Simionescu M. Simionescu N. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1304-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Here, we show that despite a loss of endothelial cell caveolae, Cav-1 null mice show dramatic increases in microvascular permeability. Because loss of caveolin-1 expression results in constitutive activation of eNOS, we also examined whether these increases in microvascular permeability were NO-dependent. Interestingly, treatment with l-NAME (a well established NOS inhibitor) successfully rescued the microvascular hyperpermeability phenotype of Cav-1 knock-out mice. Blood was collected from both wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice. Serum was then isolated by centrifuging the blood at 6000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C. The amount of serum albumin was then determined by using a color-metric Sigma diagnostics kit (Reactif Albumine). Female wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice at 2 months of age were anesthetized using pentobarbital (Abbott labs) at 136 mg/kg of body weight. Once anesthetized, 15 μl of125I-BSA at a concentration of 10 mCi/ml was mixed with 150 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline and introduced into mice via tail vein injection. The blood samples were then collected from the tail at 2, 5, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min post-injection. The samples were stored at 4 °C until all time points were obtained. Serum was then isolated by centrifuging the blood at 6000 rpm for 6 min at 4 °C. The amount of radioactivity in a 10 μl of serum was determined using a γ-counter. The rate of clearance for each mouse was determined by using the number of cpm obtained from the 2-min time point as the starting point, i.e. 100%, and shown graphically. After the last blood sample was taken at 60 min post-injection, the mice were euthanized, and various organs were isolated. The tissues were washed thoroughly in 1× phosphate-buffered saline to remove any residual blood. The amount of 125I-BSA in each tissue sample was then determined. Each tissue sample was weighed, and the amount of radioactivity in a given tissue sample was expressed as cpm/g. Untreated lung samples from both wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice were prepared for electron microscopy to examine the microvascular system of the lung (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Tight junctions from capillary endothelial cells of both wild type and Cav-1 null mice were examined, and micrographs containing 40 tight junctions/condition were generated. These tight junctions were then measured, and the averages were determined and plotted (n = 40 for each genotype). Wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice were anesthetized, as described above. The heart was then exposed, and the descending aorta was cut. A saturated solution of Ruthenium Red in 1× phosphate-buffered saline warmed to 37 °C was injected into the right ventricle at a rate of 0.5 ml/min for 10 min. Lung tissue that had been perfused with the Ruthenium Red was removed and placed in a standard fixative for electron microscopy (2.5% gluteraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer) for 2 h. The lung samples were then processed and examined by electron microscopy, as described previously (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The intensity of staining from apical and basolatral plasma membranes was determined for both wild type and Cav-1 null endothelial cells using ImageQuant software by Molecular Dynamics. Wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice were treated with or without the eNOS inhibitor,l-NAME. Mice were given an intraperitoneal injection ofl-NAME (30 mg/kg; Fisher) 1 h prior to injection of the 125I-BSA solution. Clearance of 125I-BSA from the blood was then determined, as described above. To examine the in vivo role of Cav-1 in albumin uptake, female age-matched Cav-1-deficient and wild type mice were given tail vein injections of 125I-BSA. The blood samples were taken at various time points, and the rate of clearance for radio-iodinated BSA was determined (Fig.1). At 5 min post-injection, the majority (∼70%) of iodinated BSA was cleared from the circulatory system of the Cav-1-deficient mice. In contrast, only a small fraction (∼25%) of the iodinated BSA was immediately cleared from wild type mice. Interestingly, the level of iodinated BSA in the circulatory system of the wild type mice at 60 min post-injection is greater than the levels seen in Cav-1-deficient mice at 5 min post-injection. At 60 min post-injection, the mice were euthanized, and various tissue types were isolated to determine that amount of iodinated BSA that accumulated in a given tissue. These results are shown graphically in Fig. 2; the fold differences between the levels of iodinated BSA in the Cav-1-deficient and wild type mice are directly compared. Note that all of the tissues examined showed ∼2-fold or higher accumulation of BSA (up to ∼4–8-fold in lung, spleen, kidney, and liver) in Cav-1-deficient mice, with the exception of adipose tissue and the aorta. Interestingly, adipose tissue exhibited only minimal changes in the amount of BSA accumulation in Cav-1-deficient mice. In contrast, segments of aorta taken from Cav-1-deficient mice actually showed lower levels of iodinated BSA accumulation. These data suggest that observed increases in vascular permeability in Cav-1-deficient mice occur at the microvascular level and not at the level of larger blood vessels, such as the aorta. We next measured endogenous serum albumin levels in the Cav-1-deficient mice, as compared with wild type control mice. Interestingly, endogenous serum levels of albumin are significantly lower in Cav-1-deficient mice (Fig. 3). The increased rate of clearance for iodinated BSA and lower levels of endogenous serum are both consistent with the idea that Cav-1-deficient mice have dramatic increases in microvascular permeability. Lung capillaries from both wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice were examined by electron microscopy to identify any possible ultrastructural changes. Interestingly, endothelial cell tight junctions in Cav-1-deficient mice (Fig.4, A and B) appeared to be significantly smaller than tight junctions seen in wild type animals (Fig. 4A and B). Forty tight junctions from wild type and Cav-1 endothelial cells were examined and measured (Fig.4 C). Such quantitation revealed that Cav-1-deficient tight junctions are on average ∼3.5 times smaller than wild type tight junctions. In addition, many of the Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells forming lung capillaries (Fig. 5 A,panels c and d) have regions that have clearly become detached from the basement membrane. Importantly, this cell-substrate adhesion defect was not routinely observed in wild type animals (Fig. 5 A, panels a and b). A higher magnification view is shown in Fig. 5 B that convincingly demonstrates that these “blebs” seen in Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells are delineated by the endothelial cell plasma membrane and the basement membrane. To quantitate the number of detachment sites and their frequency, 100 capillaries from wild type and Cav-1-deficient lung samples were examined, and the number of detachment sites were counted. On average, 2.19 endothelial detachment sites/capillary were observed in Cav-1-deficient lung samples. However, only 0.12 endothelial detachment sites/capillary were observed in wild type mice. In wild type lung samples, 93 of the 100 capillaries examined were found to have no sites of detachment from the basement membrane (Fig. 5 C), whereas the Cav-1-deficient lung samples had as many as nine points of detachment for an individual capillary (Fig. 5 D). These results are consistent with the proposed role of caveolin-1 in cell-substrate attachment, i.e. as a positive regulator of integrin signaling (reviewed in Ref. 26Razani B. Woodman S.E. Lisanti M.P. Pharmacolog. Rev. 2002; 54: 431-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Interestingly, neither of these abnormalities was detected in endothelial cells lining the aorta (data not shown). To further examine the possibility that capillaries in the Cav-1-deficient mice are hyperpermeable, a solution of Ruthenium Red (an electron-dense dye) was perfused into the lungs of both wild type and Cav-1-deficient mice. Normal tight junctions should block the Ruthenium Red staining from reaching the basal membrane of the endothelial cells, whereas tight junctions that are defective or hyperpermeable should allow the Ruthenium Red to penetrate to the basal membrane, resulting in both membranes being darkly stained. As expected, electron micrographs of wild type lung capillary endothelial cells (Fig. 6, Aand B) do show a difference in staining between the luminal and basal membranes. The luminal membrane (arrows) is clearly densely stained, and the basal membrane (arrowheads) shows little or no staining. In contrast, the luminal (arrows) and basal (arrowheads) membranes in the Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells (Fig. 6, C andD) are both densely stained. The staining intensity of the apical and basolateral membranes was quantitated for wild type and Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells. The apical/basolateral ratio for wild type endothelial cells was ∼5.6:1, whereas the apical/basolateral ratio for Cav-1-deficient cells was 1.7:1. Therefore, there appears to be an approximately 3-fold increase in the permeability of Cav-1-deficient endothelial cells. To examine the role of NO production in the hyperpermeability phenotype of Cav-1-deficient mice, we employed a well characterized NOS inhibitor,i.e. l-NAME. Cav-1-deficient and wild type mice were injected with l-NAME 1 h prior to the injection of iodinated BSA. Clearance studies were then performed on these animals. Fig. 7 shows that the rate of radio-iodinated BSA clearance in l-NAME-treated Cav-1-deficient mice is dramatically reduced. Note that the rate of BSA clearance for l-NAME-treated Cav-1-deficient mice approaches the clearance rates observed for wild type mice. However, treatment with l-NAME did not affect BSA clearance rates in wild type mice. The accumulation of radio-iodinated BSA in the tissues of Cav-1-deficient mice was also determined in the presence ofl-NAME (Fig. 8). As predicted, treatment with l-NAME restored iodinated BSA levels in Cav-1-deficient mice to near wild type levels in all of the tissues examined. Thus, the microvascular hyperpermeability phenotype of Cav-1-deficient mice appears to be dependent on NO production, because treatment with a NOS inhibitor clearly rescues this phenotype.Figure 8Cav-1-deficient mice treated withl-NAME have reduced 125I-BSA accumulation in their tissues. Treatment of Cav-1-deficient mice withl-NAME reduces the amount of 125I-BSA found in the various tissues. The levels of 125I-BSA accumulation observed for Cav-1-deficient mice treated with l-NAME are similar to levels seen in wild type animals (percentage of control).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined eNOS expression levels in lung tissue samples derived from wild type (+/+), heterozygous (−/+), and Cav-1-deficient (−/−) mice. However, Fig.9 shows that eNOS protein expression levels are not altered in Cav-1-deficient mice. These results demonstrate that the defects we observe in Cav-1-deficient mice are not due to overexpression of eNOS. Because caveolin-1 is thought to function as a tonic inhibitor of eNOS activity, these defects may be due to an increase in eNOS activity, as we and others have reported previously (23Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F. Russell R.G., Li, M. Pestell R.G., Di Vizio D. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Lagaud G. Christ G.J. Edelmann W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol.

Kurzchalia T.V. Science. 2001; 293: 2449-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1318) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cells form a continuous barrier separating the circulatory system from the surrounding tissues, and disruption of the endothelial barrier and subsequent increases in vascular permeability can lead to a wide variety of pathological conditions (for reviews see Refs. 28Titheradge M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 437-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar and 29Vallance P. Chan N. Heart. 2001; 85: 342-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vascular permeability is mediated by two separate pathways. Material taken up by the cell and actively transported through the cell to the opposite side is said to move via the transcellular pathway, whereas material that exits the circulatory system by passing between endothelial cell tight junctions occurs via the paracellular pathway. Previously, we have shown that loss of caveolae in fibroblasts and endothelial cells abolishes the ability of these Cav-1-deficient cells to take up albumin (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that vascular endothelial cell caveolae are directly involved in the transcellular movement of albumin. Caveolae also appear to play an indirect role in regulating vascular permeability through the ability of the caveolin-1 protein to control NO production within endothelial cells. Caveolin-1 has been shown to bind eNOS, and this binding event maintains eNOS in an inactive state. Upon receiving the proper stimulus, eNOS is released from Cav-1 binding and becomes catalytically active, and NO production ensues (13Bucci M. Gratton J.P. Rudic R.D. Acevedo L. Roviezzo F. Cirino G. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Higher levels of nitric oxide are in turn responsible for increasing vascular permeability in endothelial cells (18Inoue H. Ando K. Wakisaka N. Matsuaki K. Aihara M. Kumagai N. Nitric Oxide Biol. Chem. 2001; 5: 334-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30Takeda M. Mori F. Yoshida A. Takamiya A. Nakagomi S. Sato E. Kiyama H. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1043-1050Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that Cav-1-deficient mice have a hyperpermeable or “leaky” microvascular system, such that the clearance rate of BSA injected into the circulatory system is significantly increased. In addition, endogenous levels of serum albumin are significantly reduced in Cav-1-deficient mice, supporting a loss of proper control over vascular permeability in these mice. Initially, these findings may seem to contradict our earlier study in which aortic rings and perfused lung tissue were shown to have defects in the uptake of BSA (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). However, the aortic samples taken from Cav-1-deficient mice in the current study also show a decrease in the amount of BSA that accumulated, as compared with aortic samples derived from wild type mice (Fig. 2), in accordance with our previous findings. In addition, coupling of BSA to 5-nm colloidal gold particles is expected to dramatically alter the conformation and/or size of the BSA molecule, such that it can no longer pass through the tight junctions and remains in the blood vessel lumen (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to our current findings demonstrating that free BSA undergoes increased paracellular uptake. Thus, gold-conjugated BSA may be a good probe to follow caveolae-mediated endocytosis, but it cannot be used to mimic the transport of free BSA via the paracellular pathway. In support of our current findings that Cav-1-deficient mice have a hyperpermeable microvascular system, electron micrographs of Cav-1-deficient lung capillaries reveal alterations in tight junction morphology and defects in capillary endothelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane. In addition, injection of an electron-dense dye (Ruthenium Red) that is incapable of passing through wild type tight junctions further demonstrated that the circulatory system of Cav-1-deficient mice is hyperpermeable. Interestingly, the increased microvascular permeability observed in Cav-1-deficient mice was corrected by treatment with l-NAME, a well known NOS inhibitor. These results directly demonstrate that the observed hyperpermeability phenotype is dependent on NO production. Thus, we conclude that caveolin-1 plays two distinct roles in the regulation of vascular permeability: (i) as structural protein that is required for caveolae formation and caveolar transcytosis and (ii) as tonic inhibitor of eNOS activity to negatively regulate the paracellular pathway (summarized schematically in Fig.10). Over the past several years, it has become apparent that vascular permeability is regulated by many complex signaling pathways within endothelial cells. One of these pathways involves regulation by eNOS. Caveolin-1 acts as a natural endogenous inhibitor of eNOS by maintaining the enzyme in a catalytically inactive state. This binding and inhibitory activity are mediated by the scaffolding domain (residues 82–101) of caveolin-1 (23Razani B. Engelman J.A. Wang X.B. Schubert W. Zhang X.L. Marks C.B. Macaluso F.

Upon its stimulus-mediated release from caveolin-1 binding, eNOS becomes catalytically active, and NO production ensues. Furthermore, our current studies directly support the findings of Sessa and co-workers (13Bucci M. Gratton J.P. Rudic R.D. Acevedo L. Roviezzo F. Cirino G. Sessa W.C. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), who used a chimeric peptide containing a cellular internalization signal and the caveolin-1 scaffolding domain (CSD, residues 82–101). Using wild type mouse ears treated with an irritant (mustard oil) to induce the extravasation of Evan's blue dye, they showed that the CSD could potently act as an inhibitor of microvascular permeability/vascular leakage. The actions of the CSD could be mimicked by using the NOS inhibitor l-NAME. In further support of the specificity of the CSD, a scrambled peptide version of the CSD had no activity in this assay system. NO has been shown to increase cGMP levels by regulating the action of guanylate cyclase (17Yuan Y. Granger H.J. Zawieja D.C. DeFily D.V. Chilian W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: H1734-H1739PubMed Google Scholar). The exact mechanism as to how cGMP regulates vascular permeability is poorly understood, but one method may be by affecting the cAMP levels in endothelial cells. Levels of cAMP may be lowered by a cGMP-activated phosphodiesterase such as phosphodiesterase 2, which has been identified in endothelial cells (34Suttorp N. Hippenstiel S. Fuhrmann M. Krull M. Podzuweit T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C778-C785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Haynes Jr., J. Killilea D.W. Peterson P.D. Thompson W.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1996; 276: 752-757PubMed Google Scholar); He et al. (36He P. Zeng M. Curry F.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1865-H1874PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that increased cGMP stimulated phosphodiesterase 2 and lowered cAMP, resulting in increased permeability in rat and frog mesenteric vessels. Another possible action of cGMP is through its ability to stimulate the phosphorylation of VASP, a protein associated with focal adhesion sites and adherens junctions (37Draijer R. Atsma D.E. van der Laarse A. van Hinsbergh V.W. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However, the exact role that VASP plays in regulating vascular permeability has yet to be studied, but it could explain the observation that endothelial cell adhesion is altered upon treatment with NO (22Tsukahara H. Noiri E. Jiang M.Z. Hiraoka M. Mayumi M. Life Sci. 2000; 67: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), as well as our current findings of altered endothelial tight junction morphology and detachment from the basement membrane. Although the majority of Cav-1-deficient tissues examined in this study contained higher levels of iodinated BSA, as compared with wild type mice, segments of aorta taken from Cav-1-deficient mice showed significantly lower levels of BSA accumulation. These current findings are consistent with our previous data showing that caveolar endocytosis of radio-iodinated albumin is blocked in isolated aortic ring segments derived from Cav-1-deficient mice (24Schubert W. Frank P.G. Razani B. Park D.S. Chow C.W. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48619-48622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) In summary, we have shown that Cav-1-deficient mice demonstrate significant increases in microvascular permeability. In addition, we demonstrate that this phenotype is an NO-dependent phenomenon. As such, caveolin-1 plays a crucial role in regulating microvascular permeability via (i) caveolar transcytosis, as a structural protein that is required for caveolae formation, and (ii) the paracellular pathway, as a tonic inhibitor of eNOS activity."
https://openalex.org/W2019959952,"The C terminus of CFTR contains a PDZ interacting domain that is required for the polarized expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the apical plasma membrane of polarized epithelial cells. To elucidate the mechanism whereby the PDZ interacting domain mediates the polarized expression of CFTR, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells were stably transfected with wild type (wt-CFTR) or C-terminally truncated human CFTR (CFTR-DeltaTRL). We tested the hypothesis that the PDZ interacting domain regulates sorting of CFTR from the Golgi to the apical plasma membrane. Pulse-chase studies in combination with domain-selective cell surface biotinylation revealed that newly synthesized wt-CFTR and CFTR-DeltaTRL were targeted equally to the apical and basolateral membranes in a nonpolarized fashion. Thus, the PDZ interacting domain is not an apical sorting motif. Deletion of the PDZ interacting domain reduced the half-life of CFTR in the apical membrane from approximately 24 to approximately 13 h but had no effect on the half-life of CFTR in the basolateral membrane. Thus, the PDZ interacting domain is an apical membrane retention motif. Next, we examined the hypothesis that the PDZ interacting domain affects the apical membrane half-life of CFTR by altering its endocytosis and/or endocytic recycling. Endocytosis of wt-CFTR and CFTR-DeltaTRL did not differ. However, endocytic recycling of CFTR-DeltaTRL was decreased when compared with wt-CFTR. Thus, deletion of the PDZ interacting domain reduced the half-life of CFTR in the apical membrane by decreasing CFTR endocytic recycling. Our results identify a new role for PDZ proteins in regulating the endocytic recycling of CFTR in polarized epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2020013548,"Malaria kills millions of people every year, and new control measures are urgently needed. The recent demonstration that (effector) genes can be introduced into the mosquito germ line to diminish their ability to transmit the malaria parasite offers new hope toward the fight of the disease (Ito, J., Ghosh, A., Moreira, L. A., Wimmer, E. A. & Jacobs-Lorena, M. (2002)Nature, 417, 452–455). Because of the high selection pressure that an effector gene imposes on the parasite population, development of resistant strains is likely to occur. In search of additional antiparasitic effector genes, we have generated transgenicAnopheles stephensi mosquitoes that express the bee venom phospholipase A2 (PLA2) gene from the gut-specific and blood-inducible Anopheles gambiaecarboxypeptidase (AgCP) promoter. Northern blot analysis indicated that the PLA2 mRNA is specifically expressed in the guts of transgenic mosquitoes with peak expression at ∼4 h after blood ingestion. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses detected PLA2 protein in the midgut epithelia of transgenic mosquitoes from 8 to 24 h after a blood meal. Importantly, transgene expression reducedPlasmodium berghei oocyst formation by 87% on average and greatly impaired transmission of the parasite to naive mice. The results indicate that PLA2 may be used as an additional effector gene to block the development of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. Malaria kills millions of people every year, and new control measures are urgently needed. The recent demonstration that (effector) genes can be introduced into the mosquito germ line to diminish their ability to transmit the malaria parasite offers new hope toward the fight of the disease (Ito, J., Ghosh, A., Moreira, L.

The results indicate that PLA2 may be used as an additional effector gene to block the development of the malaria parasite in mosquitoes. Worldwide mortality due to malaria has increased in the past decade mainly because of parasite and mosquito resistance to drugs and insecticides, respectively, and the lack of effective vaccines (1Webster D. J. Public Health Policy. 2001; 22: 23-33Google Scholar). Genetically engineering mosquito vectors for refractoriness to malaria parasites is a strategy for reducing disease transmission that should be explored. Plasmodium, the causative agent of malaria, has to complete a complex developmental program in the mosquito for transmission to occur. The first interactions between the parasite and the mosquito occur in the midgut lumen, where the parasite has to traverse two barriers, the peritrophic matrix, and the midgut epithelium (2Shahabuddin M. Cociancich S. Zieler H. Parasitol. Today. 1998; 14: 493-497Google Scholar, 3Ghosh A. Edwards M.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 196-201Google Scholar). Because the gut is a closed compartment that limits diffusion, antimalarial compounds secreted into the midgut lumen are expected to efficiently target the initial stages of parasite development. Previous studies have demonstrated that venom phospholipases A2 (PLA2s) 1The abbreviations used are: PLA2, phospholipase A2; AgCP, A. gambiae carboxypeptidase; UTR, untranslated region; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. strongly inhibit oocyst formation when administered to mosquitoes with an infectious blood meal (4Zieler H. Keister D.B. Dvorak J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4157-4167Google Scholar). Although the mechanism of inhibition has not been established, it is known that PLA2 does not kill ookinetes and does not interfere with their development in vitro. Furthermore, inhibition of oocyst formation did not depend on PLA2 enzymatic activity. It is possible that PLA2 inhibits ookinete invasion by modifying the properties of the midgut epithelial membranes that are invaded by the parasite. The best candidates for driving the expression of foreign gene products to be secreted into the mosquito midgut are the promoters of bloodmeal-inducible midgut genes because of their strength, tissue specificity, and synchrony of expression with parasite ingestion by the mosquito. In this context, we have shown that the Anopheles gambiae and Aedes aegypti carboxypeptidase promoters can be used to drive strong expression of recombinant protein in the midgut of transgenic mosquitoes (5Moreira L.A. Edwards M.J. Adhami F. Jasinskiene N. James A.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10895-10898Google Scholar) and also that they can drive the expression of a parasite blocking peptide (6Ghosh A. Ribolla P.E. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Google Scholar) in transgenic mosquitoes (7Ito J. Ghosh A. Moreira L.A. Wimmer E.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nature. 2002; 417: 452-455Google Scholar). Although the latter results indicate that genetic manipulation of mosquito vectors is a promising strategy for reducing malaria transmission, it is also important to consider that the use of a single effector gene is likely to lead to rapid selection of resistant parasites. Thus, we have searched for additional effector genes whose products interfere with parasite development by mechanisms different from the previously developed ones (6Ghosh A. Ribolla P.E. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Google Scholar, 7Ito J. Ghosh A. Moreira L.A. Wimmer E.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nature. 2002; 417: 452-455Google Scholar). The results reported in this article suggest that bee venom PLA2 may be used as an alternate effector gene. The full-length cDNA of the honeybee phospholipase A2 gene was cloned for the first time by relying on the previously published partial sequence (GenBankTM accession numberX16709). Messenger RNA was isolated from 105 venom glands dissected out of newly emerged honeybees using the Micro Fast-Track mRNA isolation kit from Invitrogen. The mRNA was reverse-transcribed with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using the SMART cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech) in the presence of a primer specific to the previously published 3′ end of the honeybee PLA2 cDNA (5′-ccgccgtctagataaataaacgatctcgaagtggtactc-3′), as well as a custom-synthesized SMART primer (5′-agcagtggtttaaacgcagagtggccattatggccggg-3′). The first strand cDNA was PCR-amplified using the same two primers and Platinum-Taq high fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen), and the PCR product was cloned with the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The resulting construct BV PLA2 5-7consisted of the full-length bee venom PLA2 open reading frame flanked by 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences inserted into the pCR-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The PLA2 sequence thus obtained included the entire signal peptide, which was only partially present in previously published sequences, as well as a portion of the 5′-untranslated region (UTR). Inserts from several identical clones were sequenced, and the sequence was used to prepare PCR primers for the construction of the mosquito expression constructs. A 3.9-kb fragment from theA. gambiae carboxypeptidase gene (8Edwards M.J. Lemos F.J.A. Donnely-Doman M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 1063-1072Google Scholar) (AgCP5′; containing the promoter, 5′-UTR, and signal peptide) was amplified by PCR from a pBluescript AgCPgenomic subclone using AgCP Kpn(5′-GGTACCCTCGGCCGCTTCGACACT-3′) and T7(5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′) primers and cloned into pGemT-easy. Bee venom PLA2 coding region (450 bp) was cloned into pGemT-easy (Promega) from a cDNA clone using primersPLA2K(5′-GGTACCTGGCAAATCAGGGAT-3′) and PLA2B(5′-GGATCCTTATCAATACTTGCGAAGATC-3′). The AgCP5′in pGemT-easy was digested with KpnI, and the resulting 1.8-kb fragment was ligated into the PLA2 plasmid (KpnI-digested). AgCP3′(555 bp) (untranslated 3′ region) was obtained by PCR amplification with primersAgCP3BH(5′-GGATCCTGAAGTCTCTCCTACCGG-3′) or AgCP3SC(5′-CCGCGGTAAGGCTAGCATTGCCA-3′) on an AgCP pBluescript genomic subclone and cloned into pGemT-easy. Both theAgCP/PLA2 and AgCP in pGemT were digested with BamHI and SacII and the AgCP3′-UTR fragment ligated to AgCP5/PLA2(pGemT-easy). A NotI fragment containingAgCP/PLA2/AgCP3was cloned intopSLfa1180faplasmid (9Horn C. Wimmer E.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 630-637Google Scholar) that contains unique FseI and AscI sites. The plasmid was then cut with these enzymes and cloned into piggyBac[3xP3-EGFPafm]plasmid. The final transposon plasmid pBac[3xP3-EGFP(AgCPPLA2)]contains 1.7 kb of AgCP promoter, around 100 bp ofAgCP coding region to provide the signal sequence, 0.45 kb of PLA2 coding region, and 0.58 kb of AgCP-3′ UTRapart from the EGFP sequence (see Fig. 1). Anopheles stephensi embryos were injected as described (7Ito J. Ghosh A. Moreira L.A. Wimmer E.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nature. 2002; 417: 452-455Google Scholar, 10Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Google Scholar). Embryos were injected with a mixture of the transposon construct (0.5 mg/ml) and of the piggyBac helper plasmid (11Handler A.M. Harrell R.A. Insect Mol. Biol. 1999; 8: 449-457Google Scholar) (0.3 mg/ml), both purified on Qiagen midi-prep columns. No heat shock was performed. The surviving adults were pooled into families as follows. Adult injected males (three to five G0 mosquitoes) were crossed with 5–10 virgin non-injected females. Between three and six G1virgin injected females were pooled and mated with three to five non-injected males. Females were allowed to feed on blood, and G1 embryos were collected. Transformants were selected by screening cold-immobilized larvae for EGFP expression using a dissecting fluorescence microscope at a wavelength of 490 nm. Individual G1 transgenic mosquitoes (males or females) from positive families were mated with non-transgenic mosquitoes. Progenies of these crosses were checked for integration of the transgene as follows. Total genomic DNA was isolated from transgenic and wild type mosquitoes as described (12Black I.V. Black W.C. Munstermann L.E. Beaty B. Marquardt W.C. The Biology of Disease Vectors. University Press of Colorado, Niwot, Colorado1996: 438-470Google Scholar) but with 100 μg/ml proteinase K treatment at 52 °C for 3 h and followed by phenol:chloroform extractions and precipitation. DNA digested withBglII was separated on a 0.8% agarose gel, blotted, and hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled piggyBacprobe originating from the piggyBac vector left arm (∼0.8-kb SalI fragment from pBac[3xP3-EGFP(AgCPPLA2)](see Fig. 1, probe a)). Female mosquito guts and carcasses (whole body minus gut) and male guts were dissected from 4–5-day old adults. All tissues were immediately frozen in an ethanol/dry ice bath and stored at −80 °C. To determine the temporal profile ofPLA2 expression in transgenic mosquitoes, guts were dissected at increasing time intervals following a blood meal. Total RNA was extracted with TRI-Reagent (Molecular Research Center). Around 2.5 μg of total RNA was separated in each lane of a 1.5% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted by capillary action to a nylon membrane (Gene Screen). Hybridization was performed first with aPLA2 probe (450 bp of coding region amplified by PCR; see Fig. 1, probe b) and then with a mitochondrial rRNA probe (13Lemos F.J.A. Cornel A.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1996; 26: 651-658Google Scholar) as a loading control. Guts were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at different times after a blood meal. The equivalent of 0.4 guts/lane was analyzed by electrophoresis on a 15% polyacrylamide/SDS gel followed by electrotransfer to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). A prestained protein ladder (Benchmark, Invitrogen) was loaded on the same gel. The membrane was incubated with an anti-rabbit bee venom phospholipase A2 polyclonal antibody (Accurate; 1:2,000 dilution), and the bound antibody was detected with an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin, horseradish peroxidase-linked (New England Biolabs, 1:3,000 dilution) by exposing the blots to x-ray films. About 2 × 107 Plasmodium berghei parasites (ANKA 2.34) were inoculated per naive mouse, and gametocyte-positive mice were used to feed a mixed population of non-transgenic and transgenic mosquitoes. Mosquitoes that blood-fed were separated after 24 h and kept at 21 °C with 10% sugar solution. On day 15, midguts were dissected, and the number of oocysts was determined. Transgenic and sibling non-transgenic mosquitoes were mixed in the same container and allowed to feed on a single infected mouse. Mosquitoes that blood-fed were separated after 24 h and kept at 21 °C with 10% sugar solution. On day 25, individual female mosquitoes were separated into small feeding cups, and each mosquito was allowed to feed on a single naive mouse (Swiss Webster (CFW), Charles River Laboratory). After feeding, mosquitoes were cold-immobilized, salivary glands were dissected and homogenized in a small volume of PBS, and sporozoites were counted with a hemacytometer. The infection status of each mouse was followed by observing tail vein blood smears on days 5, 7, 9, 13, 17, 22, and 25. Female mosquito guts were dissected at different times after a blood meal in 50% ethanol and opened longitudinally to make a sheet. The gut sheets were treated with a methanol series to remove the autofluorescence as described (6Ghosh A. Ribolla P.E. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Google Scholar), fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C, washed six to seven times with PBS, and blocked for 6 h with PBS/4% bovine serum albumin/4% fetal calf serum at 4 °C. The guts were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with an anti-rabbit bee venom phospholipase A2 antibody (Accurate; 1:2,000 dilution). The sheets were washed seven times and incubated in the dark for 2 h with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma, 1:600 dilution). The gut sheets were mounted onto glass slides, covered with a drop Slowfade Antifade (Molecular Probes), and examined by fluorescence microscopy. Guts from blood-fed mosquitoes were dissected in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, fixed for 2 h at room temperature, and washed three times in PBS. After dehydration in a graded ethanol/PBS series, the guts were treated with xylenes and embedded in Paraplast (Oxford Labware), and 7–14-μm sections were mounted onto glass slides. The slides were washed twice in xylenes at room temperature followed by rehydration in a graded ethanol/PBS series. To reduce autofluorescence, slides were dehydrated and rehydrated in a graded methanol/PBS series. The slides were blocked in 10% nonfat milk and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at room temperature with an anti-bee venom phospholipase A2 antibody (Accurate; 1:300 dilution in blocking solution). Slides were washed three times for 30 min with blocking solution and incubated for 2 h at room temperature with FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Sigma; 1:600 dilution). Nuclei were visualized by staining with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Molecular Probes) diluted with Slowfade Antifade solution. Immunostaining was observed by fluorescence microscopy at ×400 magnification. DAPI staining was observed on the same sections by UV illumination and merged with the FITC-fluorescence images using Adobe PhotoShop software (Adobe Systems Inc.) For the expression of PLA2in the A. stephensi midgut, we constructed the AgCP-PLA2gene that consists of the promoter, the 5′-UTR, and the signal peptide from the AgCPgene (8Edwards M.J. Lemos F.J.A. Donnely-Doman M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 1063-1072Google Scholar) linked to the coding sequence of the bee venom PLA2gene and the AgCP 3′-UTR (Fig.1). This gene was inserted into thepSL1180fashuttle plasmid, which has unique restriction sites for cloning into the 3xP3-EGFP piggyBac transformation vector (9Horn C. Wimmer E.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2000; 210: 630-637Google Scholar). This vector allows convenient screening of transformed mosquitoes since fluorescence can easily be detected in the eyes of both larvae and adult mosquitoes. Importantly, the dark pigments of the adult eye do not interfere with detection of the GFP marker protein (7Ito J. Ghosh A. Moreira L.A. Wimmer E.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nature. 2002; 417: 452-455Google Scholar). Moreover, confined GFP expression in only a few tissues may be beneficial for mosquito fitness. piggyBac proved to be an efficient vector for A. stephensi transformation. Of 399 embryos injected, 58 adults were obtained and pooled into 18 families. Four different transgenic mosquito lines (AM3, AF1, BF4, and BM1) were established from two GFP-positive families (details in the following text). The minimum calculated transformation rate among the surviving adults was 6.9%. By comparison, transformation rates were 7% for A. stephensi with Minos (10Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Google Scholar) and 4% for the following combinations: A. stephensi with piggyBac (14Nolan T Bower T.M. Brown A.E. Crisanti A. Catteruccia F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8759-8762Google Scholar), A. aegypti with Hermes (5Moreira L.A. Edwards M.J. Adhami F. Jasinskiene N. James A.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3748-3751Google Scholar). To confirm that the transgene was stably integrated and to determine the number of integrated transposons per genome, DNA from each mosquito line was analyzed by Southern blot hybridization. Mosquito genomic DNA was digested with BglII, fractionated, blotted, and hybridized with a probe from the piggyBac left arm (Fig. 1, probe a). As shown in Fig. 2, each mosquito line carried a single transgene integrated at a different position, indicating that independent integration events had occurred in each of the four families (note that AM3 and BM1 originated from different families). No signal was detected with DNA from non-transformed mosquitoes (data not shown). Expression of the AgCP-PLA2 mRNA was investigated by Northern analysis (Fig. 3). A single band of the expected size (∼800 bases) was detected (18Kuchler K. Gmachl M. Sippl M.J. Kreil G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 249-254Google Scholar). The AgCP-PLA2 mRNA was present in the midgut of sugar-fed mosquitoes and was strongly induced by blood ingestion (peak at ∼4 h), consistent with the pattern of expression of the A. gambiaecarboxypeptidase gene (8Edwards M.J. Lemos F.J.A. Donnely-Doman M. Jacobs-Lorena M. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 1063-1072Google Scholar). Enhanced expression at 48 h was also observed, but the reasons for this are not clear. Robust mRNA expression as well as tissue and sex specificity together indicate that the 1.7-kb AgCP upstream sequence contains the necessary regulatory elements. Immunoblot analysis showed that the anti-PLA2 antibody detected a protein that was produced in a blood-inducible manner in the midguts of transgenic mosquitoes (Fig. 4). The electrophoretic mobility of the protein (17 kDa) on acrylamide gels was identical to that of an high pressure liquid chromatography-purified bee venom PLA2 protein (data not shown). Less than 0.5 gut equivalent of protein per lane was sufficient for PLA2 detection. Importantly, the recombinant protein showed a peak of expression between 8 and 24 h after a blood meal, coinciding with the time of ookinete invasion of the midgut (3Ghosh A. Edwards M.J. Jacobs-Lorena M. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 196-201Google Scholar). By 48 h, the protein was not detectable anymore, which contrasts with the Northern data. Immunofluorescence assays detected the protein in whole-mount gut sheets (Fig. 5) and in gut sections (Fig.6). In sheets, the strongest signal appeared in epithelia prepared from guts 6 h after a blood meal, whereas in sections, a much stronger signal was detected at 24 h. Presumably, by 24 h, the majority of the PLA2 had been secreted into the lumen and was lost during washing of the gut sheets (Fig. 5). Secreted PLA2 can be seen as a thick FITC signal between the epithelium and the blood meal in 24-h transgenic gut sections (Fig. 6), and this agrees with the Western data (Fig. 4).Figure 6Immunofluorescence of midgut sections.Fixed guts from non-transgenic recipient or from transgenicAgCP-PLA2BF4 mosquitoes, dissected at different times after a blood meal (indicated to the left of thepanels), were sectioned and mounted onto glass slides. The slides were incubated with a rabbit antiserum to bee venom phospholipase A2 followed by a FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (green signal). The nuclei of the midgut epithelial cells (EC) are stained with DAPI (blue signal). The ingested blood meal (BM) is also visible.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the effect of recombinant PLA2 expression onP. berghei development, we fed both transgenic and non-transgenic mosquitoes on the same infected mouse and counted the number of oocysts that formed in each group of mosquitoes. As indicated in Table I, infection prevalence (column 3) and oocyst formation (column 4) were strongly reduced in transgenic mosquitoes. In five independent experiments, oocyst formation was inhibited from 77 to 99% (average inhibition 87%, column 5).Table IEffect of PLA2 expression on P. berghei oocyst formationExperimentMosquitoesPrevalenceaPercentage of infected mosquitoes (actual numbers in parentheses).No. oocysts/gutbAverage number of oocysts per midgut and standard deviation.Inhibitionc100 − [(average oocyst number per gut in transgenic mosquitoes/average oocyst number per gut in control mosquitoes) × 100].

The effect of recombinant gene expression on the ability of mosquitoes to transmit the parasite to uninfected animals (vectorial capacity) was assessed by letting single infected mosquitoes feed on individual naive mice and determining whether these mice became infected. As reported in columns 2 and 3 of Table II, in every experiment, fewer transgenic than non-transgenic mosquitoes became infected, and the number of sporozoites in salivary glands of transgenic mosquitoes was correspondingly lower. More importantly, the ability of transgenic mosquitoes to transmit the parasite to naive mice was strongly inhibited. In three out of four experiments, transmission of P. berghei parasites from infected transgenic mosquitoes to naive mice was completely blocked, and in a fourth experiment, the proportion of transgenic mosquitoes that transmitted the parasite was much lower than in control wild type mosquitoes (Table II, column 4). We considered the possibility that inhibition of parasite development was a consequence of the fortuitous disruption of a mosquito gene upon transposon insertion or of marker GFP expression. The following considerations strongly argue against these possibilities: 1) the same phenotype (inhibition of parasite development and transmission) was observed in different mosquito lines, in which the transposon integrated at different positions of the mosquito genome (Fig. 2 and Tables I and II); 2) the same phenotype was observed when PLA2 was provided exogenously to wild type mosquitoes (4Zieler H. Keister D.B. Dvorak J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4157-4167Google Scholar); and 3) P. berghei developed equally well (oocyst and sporozoite numbers) in transgenic mosquitoes that express only GFP and hygromycin resistance gene (10Catteruccia F. Nolan T. Loukeris T.G. Blass C. Savakis C. Kafatos F.C. Crisanti A. Nature. 2000; 405: 959-962Google Scholar) as in wild type mosquitoes. 2A. Crisanti, T. Nolan, and F. Catteruccia, unpublished observations. The PLA2 protein secreted in the midgut lumen of transgenic mosquitoes is most likely responsible for inhibition of ookinete midgut invasion, as observed with the exogenously administered protein (4Zieler H.

The binding of phospholipases to their substrates, such as aggregated phospholipids and membrane surfaces, is independent of their enzymatic activity (19Lambeau G. Lazdunski M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1999; 20: 162-170Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been shown that PLA2 inhibitedPlasmodium development even when its enzymatic activity was inhibited (4Zieler H. Keister D.B. Dvorak J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4157-4167Google Scholar), suggesting that PLA2 acts primarily via its binding to exposed membrane lipids. Moreover, PLA2 had no effect on exflagellation and zygote formation and did not affect normal ookinete motility on glass slides, suggesting that this enzyme does not kill the parasite (4Zieler H. Keister D.B. Dvorak J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4157-4167Google Scholar). These considerations and the lipophylicity of the enzyme support the hypothesis that PLA2 may be acting by interfering with the interactions between Plasmodium and the midgut cell surface.PLA2 -expressing mosquitoes were normal in appearance and lived as long as the non-transformed counterparts, although an abnormal coloration of the blood meal was observed even 24 h after feeding (bright red instead of dark brown). Egg laying may also be affected. A detailed assessment of the fitness of transgenic as compared with wild type mosquitoes is under way. In summary, these experiments demonstrate that expression of the beePLA2 gene in the midgut of transgenic mosquitoes seriously compromises their ability to sustain Plasmodium development and to transmit the parasite to other vertebrate hosts. Since this PLA2 also interferes with development and transmission ofPlasmodium falciparum in A. gambiae (4Zieler H. Keister D.B. Dvorak J.A. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 4157-4167Google Scholar), we presume that PLA2 will be equally effective in curtailing transmission in this most important parasite-vector combination. Whereas reports of attempts to interfere withPlasmodium transmission by expression of defensin (20Kokoza V. Ahmed A. Cho Wen-Long Jasinskiene N. James A.A. Raikhel A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9144-9149Google Scholar) or single chain antibodies (21de Lara Capurro M. Coleman J. Beerntsen B.T. Myles K.M. Olson K.E. Rocha E. Krettli A.U. James A.A. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2000; 62: 427-433Google Scholar) in A. aegypti have appeared, their effectiveness in transgenic mosquitoes remains to be demonstrated. Separate work from this laboratory indicates that expression of SM1, a midgut and salivary gland binding peptide, also effectively inhibits development and transmission of the parasite (6Ghosh A. Ribolla P.E. Jacobs-Lorena M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13278-13281Google Scholar,7Ito J. Ghosh A. Moreira L.A. Wimmer E.A. Jacobs-Lorena M. Nature. 2002; 417: 452-455Google Scholar). The availability of multiple targets to inhibitPlasmodium development is crucial for future implementation of the transgenic mosquito approach to reduce malaria transmission in the field. This is because the Plasmodium genome is known for its plasticity, and the possibility of the emergence of resistant parasite strains needs to be avoided at all cost. Before one can consider actual release assays, much work remains to be done. Issues that need to be addressed include determination of wild mosquito population structures, an evaluation of the ability of gene(s) to spread through populations, considering the likelihood that the parasites will develop resistance to the foreign effector gene product, and concerns about horizontal transfer. The experiments reported here strongly suggest that genetic modification of mosquito vectorial capacity is feasible and represent a major step toward the goal of containing the spread of malaria. However, for maximum effectiveness, we will have to rely on a multipronged approach that may include drugs, insecticides, vaccines, and mosquito vectors expressing a combination of effector genes. We thank John Klapac for generously supplying two beehives containing young and emerging honeybees and also Greg Hundemer and Jason Snyder for excellent assistance with the handling of mosquitoes and mice. We are also grateful to members of our laboratory for helpful discussions and suggestions."
https://openalex.org/W2121238034,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS5B protein encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), the primary catalytic enzyme of the HCV replicase complex. We established a biochemical RNA synthesis assay, using purified recombinant NS5B lacking the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues, to identify potential polymerase inhibitors from a high throughput screen of the GlaxoSmithKline proprietary compound collection. The benzo-1,2,4-thiadiazine compound 1 was found to be a potent, highly specific inhibitor of NS5B. This agent interacts directly with the viral polymerase and inhibits RNA synthesis in a manner noncompetitive with respect to GTP. Furthermore, in the absence of an in vitro-reconstituted HCV replicase assay employing viral and host proteins, the ability of compound 1 to inhibit NS5B-directed viral RNA replication was determined using the Huh7 cell-based HCV replicon system. Compound 1 reduced viral RNA in replicon cells with an IC(50) of approximately 0.5 microm, suggesting that the inhibitor was able to access the perinuclear membrane and inhibit the polymerase activity in the context of a replicase complex. Preliminary structure-activity studies on compound 1 led to the identification of a modified inhibitor, compound 4, showing an improvement in both biochemical and cell-based potency. Lastly, data are presented suggesting that these compounds interfere with the formation of negative and positive strand progeny RNA by a similar mode of action. Investigations are ongoing to assess the potential utility of such agents in the treatment of chronic HCV disease."

We show here that RAGE-dependent changes in cell morphology are associated with proliferation arrest and changes in gene expression in neuroblastoma cells. Chromogranin B, a component of secretory vesicles in endocrine cells and neurons, was found to be up-regulated by RAGE signaling during differentiation of neuroblastoma cells along with the two other members of the chromogranin family, chromogranin A and secretogranin II. Ligation of RAGE by amphoterin lead to rapid phosphorylation and nuclear localization of cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (CREB), a major regulator of chromogranin expression. Furthermore, inhibition of ERK1/2-Rsk2-dependent CREB phosphorylation efficiently inhibited up-regulation of chromogranin gene expression upon RAGE activation. To further study the effects of RAGE and amphoterin on cellular differentiation, we stimulated embryonic stem cells expressing RAGE or a signaling-deficient mutant of RAGE with amphoterin. Amphoterin was found to promote RAGE-dependent neuronal differentiation of embryonic stem cells characterized by up-regulation of neuronal markers light neurofilament protein and β-III-tubulin, activation of CREB, and increased expression of chromogranins A and B. These data suggest that RAGE signaling is capable of driving neuronal differentiation involving CREB activation and induction of chromogranin expression."
https://openalex.org/W2160125876,"Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D constitute a family of GTP-binding proteins that are implicated in regulated exocytosis. Various localizations and distinct functions have been proposed for different and occasionally even for the same Rab3 protein. This is exemplified by studies demonstrating that deletion of Rab3A in knock-out mice results in dysregulation of the final stages of exocytosis, whereas overexpression of Rab3A in neuroendocrine cells causes nearly complete inhibition of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. We have now examined the properties of all Rab3 proteins in the same assays, with the long-term goal of identifying a common conceptual framework for their functions. Using quantitative immunoblotting, we found that all four Rab3 proteins were expressed in brain and endocrine tissues, although at widely different levels. Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3C co-localized to synaptic and secretory vesicles consistent with potential redundancy, whereas Rab3D was expressed at high levels only in the endocrine pituitary (where it was more abundant than Rab3A, Rab3B, and Rab3C combined), in exocrine glands, and in adipose tissue. In transfected PC12 cells, all four Rab3 proteins strongly inhibited Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. Except for a mutation that fixes Rab3 into a permanently GDP-bound state, all Rab3 mutations tested had no effect on this inhibition, including a mutation in the calmodulin-binding site that was described as inactivating (Coppola, T., Perret-Menoud, V., Lüthi, S., Farnsworth, C. C., Glomset, J. A., and Regazzi, R. (1999) EMBO J. 18, 5885–5891). Unexpectedly, overexpression of wild type Rab3A and permanently GTP-bound mutant Rab3A in PC12 cells caused a loss of secretory vesicles and an increase in constitutive, Ca2+-independent exocytosis that correlated with the inhibition of regulated Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. Our data indicate that overexpression of Rab3 in PC12 cells impairs the normal control of the final step in exocytosis, thereby converting the regulated secretory pathway into a constitutive pathway. These results offer an hypothesis that reconciles Rab3 transfection and knock-out studies by suggesting that Rab3 functions as a gatekeeper of a late stage in exocytosis.

Rab3 proteins form a family of related GTP-binding proteins called Rab3A, Rab3B, Rab3C, and Rab3D that function in regulated exocytosis. Rab3A is an abundant synaptic vesicle protein (1Fischer von Mollard G. Mignery G.A. Baumert M. Perin M.S. Hanson T.J. Burger P.M. Jahn R. Südhof T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1988-1992Google Scholar) and the most abundant Rab protein in the brain (2Geppert M. Bolshakov V.Y. Siegelbaum S.A. Takei K., De Camilli P. Hammer R.E. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1994; 369: 493-497Google Scholar). Rab3C has also been localized to synaptic vesicles, and both Rab3A and Rab3C coordinately dissociate from synaptic vesicles during exocytosis (3Fischer von Mollard G. Südhof T.C. Jahn R.A. Nature. 1991; 349: 79-81Google Scholar, 4Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Khoklatchev A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10971-10974Google Scholar). Rab3D is expressed primarily outside the brain in exocrine glands and in mast cells where it is enriched on secretory vesicles (5Valentijn J.A. Sengupta D. Gumkowski F.D. Tang L.H. Konieczko E.M. Jamieson J.D. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 70: 33-41Google Scholar, 6Tuvim M.J. Adachi R. Chocano J.F. Moore R.H. Lampert R.M. Zera E. Romero E. Knoll B.J. Dickey B.F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol.

Physiol. 1996; 271: G531-G538Google Scholar), but conflicting data have been reported about the localization of Rab3B (8Lledo P.M. Vernier P. Vincent J.D. Mason W.T. Zorec R. Nature. 1993; 364: 540-544Google Scholar, 9Stettler O. Nothias F. Tavitian B. Vernier P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 702-713Google Scholar, 10Lin C.G. Lin Y.C. Liu H.W. Kao L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 85-90Google Scholar). Few proteins have been endowed with as many contradictory attributes as Rab3. For example, co-expression of multiple Rab3s was observed in several cell types, but some studies describe a differential localization of different Rab3s in the same cell (10Lin C.G. Lin Y.C. Liu H.W. Kao L.S. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 85-90Google Scholar, 11Baldini G. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4284-4288Google Scholar, 12Piiper A. Leser J. Lutz M.P. Beil M. Zeuzem S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 287: 746-751Google Scholar), whereas other studies find a similar localization (4Fischer von Mollard G. Stahl B. Khoklatchev A. Südhof T.C. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10971-10974Google Scholar). In some reports, transfection experiments have revealed that Rab3 proteins have distinct, isoform-specific functions (13Weber E. Jilling T. Kirk K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6963-6971Google Scholar), but in other studies they were associated with similar functions (14Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Google Scholar, 15Iezzi M. Escher G. Meda P. Charollais A. Baldini G. Darchen F. Wollheim C.B. Regazzi R. Endocrinology. 1999; 13: 202-212Google Scholar). Furthermore, even for the same Rab3 protein, different approaches have suggested distinct, non-overlapping functions. For example, deletion of Rab3A in knock-out mice leads to a relatively mild phenotype that includes altered short-term synaptic plasticity and the absence of a presynaptic form of long-term potentiation (16Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Google Scholar, 17Castillo P.E. Janz R. Südhof T.C. Malenka R.C. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1997; 388: 590-593Google Scholar). Transfection of Rab3A into PC12 cells and chromaffin cells, by contrast, causes a dramatic phenotype resulting in an almost complete inhibition of exocytosis (14Chung S.H. Joberty G. Gelino E.A. Macara I.G. Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18113-18120Google Scholar, 18Holz R.W. Brondyk W.H. Senter R.A. Kuizon L. Macara I.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10229-10234Google Scholar, 19Johannes L. Lledo P.M. Roa M. Vincent J.D. Henry J.P Darchen F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2029-2037Google Scholar). Moreover, the knock-out data indicate a role for Rab3A unrelated to vesicle docking (16Geppert M. Goda Y. Stevens C. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 810-814Google Scholar), but microscopy studies of PC12 cells overexpressing Rab3A suggest a function in vesicle docking (20Martelli A.M. Baldini G. Tabellini G. Koticha D. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Traffic. 2000; 1: 976-986Google Scholar). Based on these data and many others in the literature, it has been difficult to formulate a coherent hypothesis about the localization and functions of Rab3 proteins. One potential problem is that many studies have examined only a subset of Rab3 proteins, making it impossible to compare results from different studies. Another potential problem is that all assays of Rab3 function, be it knock-out mice or transfected cells, have distinct limitations and are inherently indirect. For example, the relatively mild phenotype in the Rab3A knocak-out could be a misleading consequence of redundancy among Rab3 isoforms, whereas the inhibition of exocytosis by transfected Rab3A in PC12 cells could be because of defective biogenesis of vesicles and may be unrelated to exocytosis as such. To address these problems, at least partially, we have now directly compared the localization of all four Rab3 proteins using specific, standardized antibodies and quantitation of the protein levels. In addition, we have explored the mechanism by which Rab3 proteins inhibit exocytosis in transfected PC12 cells. We find that although the four Rab3 proteins are differentially distributed in vertebrates, all Rab3s appear to be localized on secretory vesicles. This observation suggests similar functions for and potential redundancy among Rab3 proteins, as confirmed by the finding that all four Rab3s strongly inhibited exocytosis in transfected PC12 cells. However, when we examined the mechanism of this inhibition using a series of mutants of Rab3A, the best studied Rab3 protein, we found that Rab3A overexpression did not directly inhibit exocytosis. Instead, Rab3A overexpression activated Ca2+-independent constitutive exocytosis, indicating that Rab3A is essential for a normal regulation of the final step of exocytosis. These findings agree well with studies of the Rab3A knock-out mice, which also suggested a selective role of Rab3A in the terminal stages of exocytosis.

All blots were standardized by including known amounts of heterologously expressed His-tagged Rab3 proteins. Peak areas were background-subtracted and normalized to signals of recombinant Rab3 to allow comparison between various Rab isoforms and between different blots, with Rab3A concentrations in the brain cortex as the reference point (100%). For LIMP-II and endobrevin, the signal of the tissue with the highest amount was taken as the reference point. Anesthetized adult mice were perfused transcardially with PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Brains were cryoprotected and cut into 20-μm frontal sections on a cryomicrotome (CM1325, Leica, Bensheim, Germany) as described (34Mandell J.W. Townes-Anderson E. Czernik A.J. Cameron R. Greengard P. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 19-33Google Scholar). Slices were stored in antifreeze (25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, 30% ethylene glycol, 20% glycerol) at −20 °C. Immunostaining was performed as described (32Schlüter O.M. Schnell E. Verhage M. Tzounopoulos T. Nicoll R.A. Janz R. Malenka R.C. Geppert M. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 5834-5846Google Scholar, 34Mandell J.W. Townes-Anderson E. Czernik A.J. Cameron R. Greengard P. De Camilli P. Neuron. 1990; 5: 19-33Google Scholar). Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated microscopic slides withN-propylgallate (1,5% in 60% glycerol in PBS) and viewed in an epifluorescence (Axiophot, Zeiss, Göttingen, Germany) or confocal microscope (MRC-1024, BioRad). For generation of N-terminally hexahistidine-tagged expression constructs, mouse Rab3A (primers 1236, CGGGATCCGCTTCCGCCACAGACTCTCGC, and 1209, TCAGCAGGCACAATCCTGATGAGG), Rab3B (primers 931, CATATGGCTTCAGTGACTGATGGTAAGACTGG and 932,GAATTCTGCTGCAGCAGAGGTGGGG),and Rab 3C (primers 1238, GGATCCGCCTCTGCACAAGATGCCAGG, and 1213, TTAGCAGCCACAGTTGGGCTGTGG) were cloned by PCR from mouse brain cDNA as template. Mouse Rab3D (primers 1239, CGGGATCCGCATCCGCTAGTGAGCCCCC, and 1212, CTAACAGCTGCAGCTGCTCGGCTG) cDNA was amplified from a plasmid (gift of Dr. H. Lodish, Cambridge, MA). The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript II containing a translation initiation sequence and the N-terminal hexahistidine tag (introduced by primers 1234, CTAGAAAGCTTTCCACCATGAGAGGATCGCAT CACCATCACCATCACG, and 1235, (GATCCGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCGATCCTCTCATGGTGGAAAGCTTT), and the complete inserts were transferred into the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3. A series of Rab3 expression vectors was constructed for cotransfection studies in PC12 cells (Table I). Wild type constructs lacking the N-terminal histidine tag were amplified with the primers 2029 (CGGGATCCACCATGGCTTCCGCCACAGACTCTCGCTAT) and 2037 (GGAATTCTC AGCAGGCACAATCCTGATGAGG) for Rab3A, 2038 (CGGGATCCACCATGGCTTCAGTGACTGAT GGTAAGACTGG) and 2039 (GGAATTCCTAGCAAGAGCAGTTCTGCTGGAG) for Rab3B, 2040 (CGGGATCCACCA TGAGACACGAGGCGCCCATGCAGATGGCCTCTGCACAAGATGCCAGGTTTG) and 2043 (GGAATTCTTAGCA GCCACAGTTGGGCTGTGG) for Rab3C, and 2044 (CGGGATCCACCATGGCATCCGCTAGTGAGCCCCCT) and 2047 (GGAATTCCTAACAGCTGCAGCTGCTCGGCTG) for Rab3D. Mutations were introduced by PCR with the following primers: 2029, 2031 (GGTGCGGTACCGCTCTAGACCTGCTGTGTCCC), 2030 (GGGACACAGCAGGTCTAGAG CGGTACCGCACC), and 2037 for Rab3A Q81L; 2029, 2438 (GACCTTGGAGTCTATGCCAACGGTGCTG), 2437 (CAGCACCGTTGGCATAGACTCCAAGGTC), and 2037 for Rab3A F59S; 2029, 2461 (CCTGGGCATTGTC CGTCGAGTAAGTT), 2460 (AACTTACTCGACGGACAATGCCCAGG), and2037 for Rab3A W125T; 2340 (TGATCATTGGGAACAGCAGCGTGGGCAAAAACTCGTT) and 2037 for a fragment replacing the BclI and EcoRI wild type sequence and generating Rab3A T36N; 2029 and 2361 (AGATCTGCAGCTTGATCGTCTTGTCGTTGAGGTAGATG) for a fragment replacing theBamHI and BglII wild type sequence and generating Rab3A R66L R70T; and 2038 and 2339 (CTGCAGCTTCACAGTCTTCTCATGGAGGTAGACT) for a fragment replacing the BamHI and PstI wild type sequence and generating Rab3B R66L R70T. Bacterial expression vectors for antigens for immunization were generated as follows. Rab3B was amplified with the primers 931 (CATATGGCTTCAGTGACTGATGGTAAGACTGG) and 932 (GAATTCTGCTGCAGCAGAGGTGGGG) and subcloned into the vector pHO2c (modified pET2, Novagen, Madison, WI), resulting in a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for affinity purification over Ni-NTA-agarose. Rab3D was amplified with primers with the sequence CGCATATGGCATCCGCTAGTG and GCGGATCCTAACAGCTGCAGC and subcloned into pET15b (Novagen), resulting in an N-terminal hexahistidine tag for affinity purification. Bacterial expression was performed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3). All constructs were verified by sequencing. Mouse Rab3B and Rab3C sequences were submitted to GenBankTM (accession numbers AF312036 andAF312037).Table IRab3 proteins expressed in PC12 cells by co-transfection with hGH to study the mechanism of Rab3-dependent inhibition of exocytosisRab3 ProteinPresumptive effect of mutationsaBased on Refs.14 and 48.Effect on regulated exocytosisbEffect on KCl-, ±-latrotoxin-, and Ca2+-triggered release of co-transfected hGH as shown in Figs.6-9.Effect on constitutive exocytosiscSee Figs. 10-12.

Open table in a new tab PC12 cells (obtained from the ATCC) were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, and penicillin and streptomycin (50 u/ml each) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified atmosphere. PC12 cells were split from a confluent flask and seeded after vigorous trituration onto 6-well plates (35-mm diameter) to achieve 50–60% confluence on the day of transfection. Typically, 1 μg of phGH-CMV5 and 1 μg of test plasmid DNA/well were co-transfected using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a ratio of 1:3 (μg: μl) according to the manufacturer's specifications. 2–3 days after transfection, PC12 cells were collected and replated onto collagen-coated 12-well plates (22-mm diameter) at a ratio of four 22-mm wells/each transfected 35-mm well. The next day, cells were briefly rinsed with Krebs bicarbonate buffer (KBB; 118 mm NaCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, 3.5 mm KCl, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 11.5 mmglucose, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5), and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere with KBB (for basal secretion) or stimulating media (high potassium KBB: 56 mm KCl and 59.5 mm NaCl; or 0.5 nmα-latrotoxin in KBB). Assay media were cleared by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 4–5 min, and EDTA was added to 4–5 mm. Corresponding PC12 cells were lysed in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. Resulting cell extracts were cleared by high-speed centrifugation. The amounts of hGH secreted into the medium and remaining in the cell extracts were quantified by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Cells were transfected as described above. One 6-well plate was used per each construct. 3–4 days after transfection, cells were collected and divided into two groups. One part, equivalent to the amount of PC12 cells in one 35-mm well, was re-plated onto four collagen-coated 22-mm wells and processed for the standard secretion assays from intact PC12 cells. The remainder of the transfected cells was used in cracked PC12 cell secretion assays modified from Klenchinet al. (35Klenchin V.A. Kowalshyk J.A. Martin T.F.J. Methods Companion Methods Enzymol. 1998; 18: 204-208Google Scholar). Cells were washed with KBB followed by a second washing with ice-cold KGlu buffer (120 mm potassium glutamate, 20 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.2). Cells were resuspended in 6 ml of KGlu buffer and permeabilized by freezing at −80 °C overnight followed by slow thawing at room temperature. EGTA was added to 10 mm, and cells were left on ice for 1–2 h to allow efficient extraction of cytosolic proteins. Resulting cell ghosts were washed 2–3 times with KGlu buffer containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. PC12 cell ghosts prepared from one 6-well plate were used in 20–32 assay reactions. Each reaction mixture contained washed PC12 cell ghosts, 2 mm Mg-ATP, 10% rat brain cytosol (6–10 mg/ml total protein), and varying concentrations of calcium in the total reaction volume of 200 μl of KGlu buffer. Free Ca2+concentrations in the EGTA-Ca2+ buffer were calculated using EqCal software (Biosoft). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min, chilled on ice, and centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min. To determine total cellular hGH levels, pelleted PC12 ghosts were lysed in PBS containing 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. Resulting ghost extracts were cleared by high-speed centrifugation. The amounts of hGH secreted into the medium and remaining in the PC12 ghost extracts were quantified by radioimmunoassay (Nichols Institute Diagnostics). Isolation of small synaptic vesicles was done as described previously (36Nagy A. Baker R.R. Morris S.J. Whittaker V.P. Brain Res. 1976; 109: 285-309Google Scholar). For immunoisolation of organelles, monoclonal antibodies Cl69.1 (anti-synaptobrevin 2), Cl42.2 (anti-Rab3A), and Cl621.3 (anti-Rab5) were coupled covalently to Eupergit C1Z methacrylate microbeads, and isolations from rat brain homogenates were performed as described previously (37Burger P.M. Mehl E. Cameron P.L. Maycox P.R. Baumert M. Lottspeich F., De Camilli P. Jahn R. Neuron. 1989; 3: 715-720Google Scholar, 38Antonin W. Holroyd C. Fasshauer D. Pabst S. Von Mollard G.F. Jahn R.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6453-6464Google Scholar). To study the effects of overexpression of Rab3A on subcellular localization of hGH, PC12 were co-transfected with the hGH expression vector and either the empty control vector or the Rab3 expression vector as described above. Three days after transfections, PC12 cells were labeled overnight with [3H]norepinephrine (AmershamBiosciences, 6 μCi, 30–50 Ci/mmol/6-well plate) in the presence of 0.5 mm ascorbic acid. The next day, cells were washed with KBB, resuspended in 0.25 ml of ice-cold water, and incubated for 5 min on ice. Cell suspension was diluted with an equal volume of 2× TNE buffer (1× = 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), and passed 10 times through a 28.5-gauge needle. Cell homogenate was centrifuged twice at 800 ×g for 10 min to obtain postnuclear supernatant. 0.4 ml of postnuclear supernatant was loaded onto 10 ml of discontinuous sucrose gradients made of 2-ml steps of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2m sucrose in TNE buffer and centrifuged at 35,000 rpm for 2.5 h (SW41 rotor ∼200,000 × g). Fractions of 0.5–0.6 ml were collected from the top of the gradients. The amounts of norepinephrine in the fractions were determined directly by liquid scintillation counting. To measure hGH, fractions were diluted with PBS, subjected to three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing, and analyzed by radioimmunoassay. For analysis of protein markers, fractions were diluted 10 times with TNE buffer and centrifuged overnight at 200,000 × g. Membranes were resuspended in SDS-PAGE loading buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. PC12 cell transfections were performed as described for the secretion assays. Aliquots of the extracellular media (50 μl) were collected on days 2, 3, and 4 after transfection, diluted 10 times with PBS containing 5 mmEDTA, and assayed for hGH. On day 4 after transfection, the PC12 cells were collected, washed with PBS, and lysed by three cycles of freezing and thawing to determine the intracellular hGH. The amount of hGH secreted into the culture media on days 2, 3, and 4 was normalized in comparison with the amount of hGH remaining in PC12 cells at the day 4. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's specifications. RNA blotting experiments were performed with isoform-specific probes and commercial RNA blots (obtained from Clontech Inc.). Although prior studies have examined the tissue distributions of Rab3 proteins (e.g. see Ref. 39Matsui Y. Kikuchi A. Kondo J. Hishida T. Teranishi Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11071-11074Google Scholar), no study has compared all four Rab3 proteins, and no measurements of the relative levels of different Rab3s have been attempted. One of the four Rab3 proteins, Rab3B, has not even been studied yet at the protein level, presumably because of a lack of specific antibodies. Therefore our first goal was to generate specific antibodies to all four Rab3 proteins, and to measure their sensitivity and specificity. We chose to study Rab3 proteins with antibodies instead of simply measuring the Rab3 mRNAs because it is difficult to quantify mRNA levels for comparisons between different proteins and because mRNA levels often do not correlate with protein levels; this proved to be particularly true for Rab3 proteins (see below). We characterized a total of nine antibodies to the four Rab3 proteins, using either newly generated (583, U953, U954, αR3D#2, αR3D#3, SA5"
https://openalex.org/W2029181535,"The amyloid hypothesis suggests that the process of amyloid-beta protein (Abeta) fibrillogenesis is responsible for triggering a cascade of physiological events that contribute directly to the initiation and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Consequently, preventing this process might provide a viable therapeutic strategy for slowing and/or preventing the progression of this devastating disease. A promising strategy to achieve prevention of this disease is to discover compounds that inhibit Abeta polymerization and deposition. Herein, we describe a new class of small molecules that inhibit Abeta aggregation, which is based on the chemical structure of apomorphine. These molecules were found to interfere with Abeta1-40 fibrillization as determined by transmission electron microscopy, Thioflavin T fluorescence and velocity sedimentation analytical ultracentrifugation studies. Using electron microscopy, time-dependent studies demonstrate that apomorphine and its derivatives promote the oligomerization of Abeta but inhibit its fibrillization. Preliminary structural activity studies demonstrate that the 10,11-dihydroxy substitutions of the D-ring of apomorphine are required for the inhibitory effectiveness of these aporphines, and methylation of these hydroxyl groups reduces their inhibitory potency. The ability of these small molecules to inhibit Abeta amyloid fibril formation appears to be linked to their tendency to undergo rapid autoxidation, suggesting that autoxidation product(s) acts directly or indirectly on Abeta and inhibits its fibrillization. The inhibitory properties of the compounds presented suggest a new class of small molecules that could serve as a scaffold for the design of more efficient inhibitors of Abeta amyloidogenesis in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1977703065,"The inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP3R) is a ubiquitously expressed intracellular calcium (Ca2+) release channel on the endoplasmic reticulum. IP3Rs play key roles in controlling Ca2+ signals that activate numerous cellular functions including T cell activation, neurotransmitter release, oocyte fertilization and apoptosis. There are three forms of IP3R, all of which are ligand-gated channels activated by the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Channel function is modulated via cross-talk with other signaling pathways including those mediated by kinases and phosphatases. In particular IP3Rs are known to be regulated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation. In the present study we show that PKA and the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A are components of the IP3R1 macromolecular signaling complex. PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 increases channel activity in planar lipid bilayers.

These channels form the pathways for Ca2+ release that amplifies signals transmitted via plasma membrane receptors. The amplitude, frequency, and subcellular localization of Ca2+ signals play an important role in determining cellular responses. IP3Rs require the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) for activation but they are also regulated physiologically via cross-talk with other signaling pathways. Among the signaling pathways that modulate IP3R function are those involving kinases and phosphatases. IP3Rs are phosphorylated by cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) (1Danoff S.K.

The neuronal type IP3R1, defined by inclusion of an alternatively spliced 40-amino acid exon located between the two PKA phosphorylation sites, is preferentially phosphorylated at Ser-1755, whereas the peripheral IP3R1 is phosphorylated more on Ser-1589. IP3R2 and IP3R3 lack these consensus PKA phosphorylation sites, although they do contain other putative PKA phosphorylation sites. Although initial studies have suggested that PKA phosphorylation decreases IP3-induced Ca2+ release (14Supattapone S. Danoff S.K. Theibert A. Joseph S.K. Steiner J. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

PKA targeted to IP3R3 has been shown to decrease IP3-induced Ca2+ release in pancreatic acinar cells (6Giovannucci D.R. Sneyd J. Groblewski G.E. Yule D.I. J. Korean Med.

Recently we showed that the cardiac and skeletal muscle ryanodine receptors (RyR1 and RyR2) are macromolecular signaling complexes that include PKA and phosphatases (PP1 for RyR1; PP1 and PP2A for RyR2) (17Marx S.O.

We now show that IP3R1 from rat cerebellum is also a macromolecular complex that includes PKA, PP2A, and PP1. Rat brain ER was prepared as described (37Kaznacheyeva E. Lupu V.D. Bezprozvanny I. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 847-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, rat whole brain was minced and homogenized on ice, using a glass tissue homogenizer in buffer A (5 mm NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 5 μg/ml aprotonin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm pefabloc). Homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 4,000 × g. Supernatant was filtered through cheesecloth and centrifuged for 30 min at 90,000 × g. Pellet was resuspended in buffer B (0.6 m KCl, 5 mm NaN3, 20 mmNa4P2O7, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2)), incubated on ice for 15 min, and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 15 min. The resultant supernatant was centrifuged at 90,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet from the last spin was resuspended in buffer C (10% sucrose, 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0)). Rat brain ER (200 μg) was suspended in 0.5 ml of modified radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.9% NaCl, 0.5 mm NaF, 0.5 mmNa3VO4, 0.25% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and incubated with antibody overnight at 4 °C (IgG alone was used as negative control for each antibody). Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, washed with 1× phosphorylation buffer (8 mmMgCl, 10 mm EGTA, 50 mm Tris, 50 mmPIPES (pH 6.8)), and resuspended in 10 μl of 1.5× phosphorylation buffer containing either vehicle alone, PKA catalytic subunit (Sigma), PKA plus PKA inhibitor, PKI (Calbiochem), or cAMP as indicated. Phosphorylation of the immunoprecipitated IP3R was initiated with MgATP (33 μm) and [γ-32P]ATP and terminated after 5 min (PKA catalytic subunit) or 15 min (cAMP) at room temperature with the addition of 5 μl of stop solution (4% SDS and 0.25 mdithiothreitol). Samples were heated to 95 °C and size-fractionated on 6% SDS-PAGE, and IP3R radioactivity was assessed with autoradiography. Microcystin-Sepharose (35 μl, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was used to isolate IP3R from 200 μg of rat brain ER by incubating it at 4 °C for 4 h followed by washing with modified radioimmune precipitation buffer. Beads were resuspended in 6× SDS loading buffer and boiled. The supernatant was size-fractionated on SDS-PAGE. PP1 and PP2A bound to the microcystin-Sepharose beads were competed off with free microcystin-LR (Calbiochem). The samples were washed three times with 1 ml of radioimmune precipitation buffer. Beads were resuspended in 6× loading buffer and boiled. The samples were size-fractionated on either a 6 or 12% SDS-PAGE. Immunoblots were performed as described (9Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 35Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). After washing in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the blots were incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit (1:3000 Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After washing in Tris-buffered saline + 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h, the blots were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Rat brain ER membranes (1 mg/ml) were fused with a black lipid membrane in a chamber similar to that described by Miller (36Miller C. Ion Channel Reconstitution. Plenum, New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). Membranes were formed as described below across a hole in a partition between two chambers. After membrane formation, vesicles were added to the one chamber (designatedcis) where they fused to the membrane. Dioleoyl-phosphatidylethanolamine and dioleoyl-phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a molar ratio of 3:1 were used as lipids. To measure the Ca2+ current through the IP3R1 channel,cis and trans chambers were filled with the following solutions: cis solution, 250 mm Hepes, 113.8 mm Tris, 0.7 mm CaCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.4; trans solution, 53 mm Ca(OH)2, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 250 mm Hepes, 50 mm KCl, pH 7.35. After formation of the bilayer membrane, native membrane vesicles were added to the cis chamber while mixture was stirred. Fusion of the membrane vesicles, proteoliposomes, or proteins with the bilayer was detected by step changes in membrane currents monitored under voltage clamp conditions as described (9Jayaraman T. Ondrias K. Ondriasova E. Marks A.R. Science. 1996; 272: 1492-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). After incorporation of the channel into the bilayer, the cisand/or trans chamber was perfused with the desired solutions. The cis chamber was connected to the head-stage input of an Axon 200 amplifier (Axon Instruments) by an Ag/AgCl electrode and agar/KCl bridges. The trans chamber was held at ground with a similar electrode. Single channel currents were continuously monitored and recorded with a Digital Audio Tape (DAT) and/or a chart recorder. Recordings were filtered through a low-pass Bessel (Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA) at 2 kHz and digitized at 0.5 kHz. Single channel properties were analyzed using PClamp 6.01 software. Data were collected for at least 3 min after the addition of channel modulators. In all experiments IP3 (5 μm) was added after the membrane was established, and only channels that were activated by the addition of IP3 were studied. Control channels were activated by 5 μm IP3 in the presence of 100 μm ATP in the cissolution. IP3R1 immunoprecipitated from rat brain was PKA-phosphorylated inin vitro kinase reactions (Fig.1). To confirm the identity of the PKA-phosphorylated high molecular weight protein as IP3R1, the phosphorylated band was immunoblotted with anti-IP3R1 antibody. The specificity of the phosphorylation was demonstrated using a PKA inhibitor (PKI, Fig. 1). The addition of phosphorylation buffer including cAMP without exogenous PKA also resulted in phosphorylation of IP3R1 that was inhibited by PKI, indicating that endogenous PKA was associated with IP3R1 (Fig. 1). IP3R1 was co-immunoprecipitated from rat brain with the catalytic subunit of PKA (Fig. 2). IP3R1. Also co-immunoprecipitated with IP3R1 were two of the major protein phosphatases, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) (Fig. 3). These data are consistent with a high molecular weight complex comprising IP3R1, PKA, PP1, and PP2A.Figure 3Two protein phosphatases, PP1 and PP2A, are components of the IP3R1 macromolecular complex. PP1 (upper panel) and PP2A (lower panel) were co-immunoprecipitated with IP3R1 from 100 μg of rat brain ER. In thefirst lane in each blot 10 μg of rat brain ER was loaded as a positive control for the anti-PP1 and anti-PP2A antibodies (10% of the amount used for immunoprecipitation). PP1 and PP2A were immunoprecipitated with anti-PP1 or anti-PP2A and anti-IP3R1 antibodies. IgG alone and pre-absorbed anti-IP3R1 antibodies (pre-absorbed with the antigenic peptide as described previously (35Moschella M.C. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1137-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar)) were used as negative controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The phosphatase inhibitor microcystin binds to PP1 and PP2A. IP3R1 was sedimented by binding to microcystin-Sepharose beads; the specificity of this interaction was demonstrated by competing off IP3R1 using free microcystin-LR (Fig. 4). IP3R1 was also sedimented using cAMP-Sepharose beads that bind to the regulatory subunit of PKA (RII) (Fig. 4). The specificity of this reaction was demonstrated by competing off IP3R1 using excess RII (Fig. 4). Taken together these data show that PKA, RII, PP1, and PP2A comprise a macromolecular complex with IP3R1. PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 in planar lipid bilayers resulted in a significant increase in P o from 0.0002 to 0.001 ± 0.0002 (n = 4/4, e.g. Fig.5). In these experiments channelP o is low after the addition of IP3 because the [Ca2+]cis (cytoplasmic) was 400 nm, a level at which IP3R1 channels have been shown to have low activity (19Bezprozvanny I. Watras J. Ehrlich B. Nature. 1991; 351: 751-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (1436) Google Scholar). However, in one experiment a long lasting open state was observed following PKA phosphorylation of an IP3R1 channel in the bilayer. These data show that PKA phosphorylation activates IP3R1 channels in planar lipid bilayers. In the present study we show that neuronal IP3R1 is a macromolecular complex that includes PKA, PP1, and PP2A. There are two PKA phosphorylation sites on IP3R1, serines 1589 and 1755 (1Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 2Ferris C.D.

In non-neuronal tissues, alternative splicing results in deletion of a 40-amino acid exon (1Danoff S.K. Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ferris C.D. Donath C. Fischer G.A. Munemitsu S. Ullrich A. Snyder S.H. Ross C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2951-2955Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The data presented in this study suggest that the phosphorylation of one or both of these sites is regulated by components of the IP3R1 macromolecular complex in a manner similar to that previously shown for the closely related channels, type 1 and type 2 ryanodine receptors (RyR1 and RyR2), found in skeletal and cardiac muscle (17Marx S.O.

Therefore, IP3R1 can be added to the list of ion channels that comprise macromolecular complexes designed to modulate channel activity in response to stimulation of adrenergic signaling pathways that reflect sympathetic nervous system activity. In the present study we also show that IP3R1 channels in planar lipid bilayers can be activated by PKA phosphorylation (Fig. 5). These data suggest that PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 provides a mechanism for increasing channel activity, although extension of the in vitro studies presented in this paper to in vivoconditions may not apply to all situations. Indeed, previous studies have provided conflicting data showing that PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 in vesicles either activates (3Nakade S. Rhee S.K. Hamanaka H. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

The conflicting conclusions reached by these studies, all of which used Ca2+ flux measurements to infer the effects of PKA phosphorylation of IP3R1 on channel function, underscore the importance of studies examining the effects of PKA phosphorylation directly on single channel function. Indeed, the effects of PKA phosphorylation on other proteins in the vesicles may explain the discrepancies between these studies. For example, PKA phosphorylation can activate Ca2+ uptake pumps in vesicles, and this would decrease Ca2+ release. Thus, variations in the density of Ca2+ pumps in the vesicles could explain why one group finds PKA-induced increased Ca2+ release and another group finds a decrease. A direct examination of single channel currents in planar lipid bilayers in the present study suggests that, at least in the absence of many other cellular proteins, PKA phosphorylation of the IP3R1 can activate the channel. The in vivo effect of PKA phosphorylation on net intracellular Ca2+ release would of course reflect the activity of multiple molecules involved in regulating Ca2+ fluxes and is likely to be complex, as shown in a variety of cellular systems (25Straub S.V.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1340-1348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The finding that the IP3R1 macromolecular complex includes PKA, PP1, and PP2A points to the similarities between this complex and that of the closely related channels RyR1 and RyR2 (18Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the RyR1 and RyR2 macromolecular complexes involve targeting of kinases and phosphatases to the channels via targeting proteins (18Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we showed that these targeting proteins contain leucine/isoleucine zippers (LIZs) that specifically bind to LIZs on the RyRs (18Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These LIZs are highly conserved between RyR isoforms and through evolution (18Marx S.O. Reiken S. Hisamatsu Y. Gaburjakova M. Gaburjakova J. Yang Y.M. Rosemblit N. Marks A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Moreover, the role of LIZs in the formation of ion channel macromolecular complexes is also present in voltage-gated channels including the potassium channel KCNQ1 (20Marx S.O. Kurokawa J. Reiken S. Motoike H. D'Armiento J. Marks A.R. Kass R.S. Science. 2002; 295: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). We have identified three LIZ motifs that are highly conserved between IP3R isoforms. Based on the analogy to the RyR system, we would expect that these putative LIZs may form binding sites for targeting proteins that direct PKA, PP1, and PP2A to IP3Rs. We are currently performing yeast two-hybrid assays to identify potential targeting proteins. Only one of the three putative LIZs shares homology with one of the RyR LIZs; this sequence is homologous to the muscle A-kinase-anchoring protein (mAKAP) binding site on RyR2. The IP3R1 macromolecular complex contains additional proteins beyond those described in the present study, including: calmodulin (27Yamada M. Miyawaki A. Saito K. Nakajima T. Yamamoto-Hino M. Ryo Y.

Moreover, it is highly likely that additional components of the IP3R1 macromolecular complex will be added to this growing list. In the present study we have shown, using two independent methods (co-immunoprecipitation and cAMP-Sepharose and microcystin-Sepharose pull-downs), that IP3R1 is a macromolecular complex that includes PKA, PP1, and PP2A. We have also shown that PKA phosphorylation activates IP3R1 at the single channel level. Defining the components of the IP3R1 macromolecular signaling complex provides important information that can be used to characterize further the physiological role of modulation of IP3R1 by PKA phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2099080968,"Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is known to cause neuronal injury and dementia in a significant proportion of patients. However, the mechanism by which HIV-1 mediates its deleterious effects in the brain is poorly defined. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of the HIV-1tat gene on the expression of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astroglia. Expression of the tat gene as RSV-tat but not that of the CAT gene as RSV-CAT in U373MG astroglial cells led to the induction of NO production and the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA. Induction of NO production by recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced NO production by anti-Tat antibodies suggest that RSV-tat-induced production of NO is dependent on Tat and that Tat is secreted from RSV-tat-transfected astroglia. Similar to U373MG astroglial cells, RSV-tat also induced the production of NO in human primary astroglia. The induction of human iNOS promoter-derived luciferase activity by the expression of RSV-tat suggests that RSV-tat induces the transcription of iNOS. To understand the mechanism of induction of iNOS, we investigated the role of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, transcription factors responsible for the induction of iNOS. Activation of NF-κB as well as C/EBPβ by RSV-tat, stimulation of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by the wild type of p65 and C/EBPβ, and inhibition of RSV-tat-induced production of NO by Δp65, a dominant-negative mutant of p65, and ΔC/EBPβ, a dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPβ, suggest that RSV-tat induces iNOS through the activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ. In addition, we show that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but not that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) is involved in RSV-tat induced production of NO. Interestingly, PD98059, an inhibitor of the ERK pathway, and ΔERK2, a dominant-negative mutant of ERK2, inhibited RSV-tat-induced production of NO through the inhibition of C/EBPβ but not that of NF-κB.

The histopathological signs of HAD include infiltration of inflammatory cells, astrogliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes, and neuronal apoptotic death. Productive HIV-1 infection in the brain occurs predominantly in macrophages, microglia, and multinucleated giant cells (2Bagasra O. Lavi E. Bobroski L. Khalili K. Pestaner J.B. Pomerantz R.J.

Infection of astrocytes may also occur with restricted virus replication, affirming that the effects of HIV on astrocytes may be indirect (4Glass J.D. Johnson R.T. Annu. Rev.

The correlation between the disease severity and the viral load is unconvincing, and the neurotoxicity of the virus itself is controversial (4Glass J.D. Johnson R.T. Annu. Rev.

Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1994; 53: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that indirect mechanisms possibly play an important role in the observed neuronal loss in HAD. One means by which indirect effects may be exerted upon neural cells is via nitric oxide (NO) production. NO, a diffusible gas, plays an important role in many physiological and diverse pathophysiological conditions (10Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 11Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). At low concentration, NO has been shown to play a unique role in neurotransmission and vasodilation, whereas at higher concentrations it is neurotoxic (10Nathan C. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (4129) Google Scholar, 11Jaffrey S.R. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 417-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Consistently, NO, derived in excessive amount from the activation of inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) in glial cells (astroglia and microglia) and macrophages, is assumed to contribute to neuronal abnormalities in HAD (12Adamson D.C.

Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid and serum from HAD patients has shown increased levels of nitrite and nitrate compared with non-HIV infected patients (16Giovannoni G. Miller R.F. Heales S.J.

The reaction of NO with O2− forms peroxynitrite, ONOO−, a strong nitrosating agent capable of nitrosating tyrosine residues of a protein to nitrotyrosine. Consistently increasing levels of nitrotyrosine have been found in brains of demented, but not in nondemented, AIDS patients (17Boven L.A. Gomes L. Hery C. Gray F. Verhoef J. Portegies P. Tardieu M. Nottet H.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4319-4327PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analysis of normal and HAD brains also show markedly higher expression of iNOS mRNA and protein in HAD brains than in normal brains (13Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D. McArthur J.C. Christov V.I. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which NO is produced in the brains of HAD patients is unclear. The HIV-1 regulatory protein, Tat, is a potent transactivator of viral and cellular gene expression that is produced in the early phase of infection and actively secreted into the extracellular environment, from where it can act in an autocrine or a paracrine manner (18Chang H.K. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Biomed. Sci. 1995; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We report herein that the HIV-1 tatgene induces the production of NO and the expression of iNOS through the activation of NF-κB and C/EBPβ in human astrocytes. Fetal bovine serum, Hanks' balanced salt solution, and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 were from Invitrogen.l-N G-Monomethylarginine (l-NMA),d-N G-monomethylarginine (d-NMA), PD98059, and SB203580 were purchased from Biomol. Arginase was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS were obtained from Calbiochem. Recombinant Tat protein and anti-Tat monoclonal antibodies were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health. HIV-Tat was from Dr. J. Brady, Tat monoclonal antibodies from Dr. K. Krohn. 125I-labeled protein A, [α-32P]dCTP, and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Dominant-negative mutants of ERK1, ERK2, and p38 were kindly provided by Dr. Jawed Alam (Alton Ochsner Medical Foundation, New Orleans, LA). The wild type p65, the wild type C/EBPβ, and the dominant-negative mutant of C/EBPβ were kindly provided by Dr. Sankar Ghosh (Yale University School of Medicine), Dr. Ormond A. Macdougald (University of Michigan Medical School), and Dr. Steve Smale (University of California at Los Angeles), respectively. Human CNS tissue was obtained from the Human Embryology Laboratory, University of Washington, Seattle. The CNS tissue from each specimen was processed separately and independently, as were subsequent cell cultures. There was no pooling of CNS tissue from distinct specimens. All of the experimental protocols were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB 224-01-FB) of the University of Nebraska Medical Center. These cells were grown in a serum-free, defined medium (B16) enriched with 5 ng of basic fibroblast growth factor/ml for optimal growth of astrocytes and for the suppression of fibroblast growth (19McCarthy M. Wood C. Fedoseyeva L. Whittemore S. J. Neurovirol. 1995; 1: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence assay, these cultures homogeneously expressed glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Cells were trypsinized, subcultured, and stimulated with different cytokines in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium. Human U373MG astrocytoma cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were also maintained and induced with different stimuli as indicated above. The plasmid RSV-CAT expressing the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was constructed as described (20Yamamoto T. Jay G. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The recombinant plasmid RSV-tat was constructed by replacing the CAT gene in the RSV-CAT construct with theSalI-KpnI fragment of HIV-1, which contains the exon I of the HIV tat gene. The construction of this plasmid was described in detail previously (21Jung M. Wood C. Life Sci. Adv. 1991; 10: 77-88Google Scholar). Cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with different amounts of either RSV-CAT or RSV-tat construct by LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol (22Pahan K.

After 24 h of incubation, culture supernatants were transferred to measure NO production. Synthesis of NO was determined by assay of culture supernatants for nitrite, a stable reaction product of NO with molecular oxygen. Briefly, 400 μl of culture supernatant was allowed to react with 200 μl of Griess reagent (25Feinstein D.L. Galea E. Roberts S. Berquist H. Wang H. Reis D.J. J.

The optical density of the assay samples was measured spectrophotometrically at 570 nm. Fresh culture medium served as the blank in all experiments. Nitrite concentrations were calculated from a standard curve derived from the reaction of NaNO2 in the assay. Protein was measured by the procedure of Bradford (29Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis for iNOS was carried out as described earlier (26Pahan K. Namboodiri A.M.S. Sheikh F.G. Smith B.T.

Briefly, cells were detached by scraping, washed with Hanks' buffer, and homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). After electrophoresis the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and the iNOS band was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies against mouse macrophage iNOS and 125I-labeled protein A. Cells were taken out of the culture dishes directly by adding Ultraspec-II RNA reagent (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc.), and total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Northern blot analyses, 20 μg of total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gels, electrotransferred to Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and hybridized at 68 °C with32P-labeled cDNA probe using Express Hyb hybridization solution (Clontech) as described by the manufacturer. The cDNA probe was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification using two primers (forward primer, 5′-CTC CTT CAA AGA GGC AAA AAT A-3′; reverse primer, 5′-CAC TTC CTC CAG GAT GTT GT-3′) (26Pahan K.

After hybridization, the filters were washed two or three times in solution I (2× SSC, 0.05% SDS) for 1 h at room temperature followed by solution II (0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50 °C for another hour. The membranes were then dried and exposed to x-ray films (Kodak). The same amount of RNA was hybridized with probe for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Cells plated at 50–60% confluence in 6-well plates were cotransfected with 0.5 μg of phiNOS(7.2)Luc 2K. Pahan, X. Liu, B. S. Taylor, C. Wood, and S. M.

All transfections also included 50 ng of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, used as transfection efficiency control; Promega)/μg of total DNA. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 24 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were obtained by analyzing total cell extract according to standard instructions provided in the Dual Luciferase Kit (Promega) in a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs). Relative luciferase activity of cell extracts was typically represented as the ratio of firefly luciferase value/Renilla luciferase value × 103. To assay the transcriptional activities of NF-κB and C/EBPβ, cells at 50–60% confluence were transfected with either pBIIX-Luc, an NF-κB-dependent reporter construct (31Jana M. Liu X. Koka S. Ghosh S. Petro T.M. Pahan K. J. Biol.

All transfections included 50 ng/μg total DNA of pRL-TK (a plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase, used as transfection efficiency control; Promega). After 24 h of transfection, cells were treated with different stimuli for 6 h. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were analyzed as described above. U373MG astroglial cells (50–60% confluent) were transfected with different concentrations of either RSV-tat or RSV-CAT. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with serum-free medium. After 18 h of incubation, ERK and p38 MAPK activities were measured using assay kits obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Briefly, cells were harvested under nondenaturing conditions at different time intervals, and cell lysates were prepared. Activated forms of ERK and p38 MAPK were pulled down from the cell lysate by immunoprecipitation using immobilized phospho-ERK and phospho-p38 MAPK monoclonal antibodies, respectively. The pellets were washed twice with kinase buffer and finally resuspended with 50 μl kinase buffer supplemented with 200 μm ATP and either ELK-1 fusion protein (for ERK) or ATF-2 fusion protein (for p38 MAPK). Following incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, samples were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against phospho-ELK-1 or phospho-ATF-2. To study the effect of HIV-1 Tat on the expression of iNOS, we transfected human astroglial cells transiently with HIV-1 tat gene. The plasmid RSV-tat expressing the exon I of the HIV-1 tatgene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter was used to transfect human U373MG astroglial cells. Expression of RSV-tat but not of RSV-CAT induced the production of NO (Table I). The inhibition of NO production by arginase, an enzyme that degrades the substrate (l-arginine) of NOS, and l-NMA, a competitive inhibitor of NOS, but not by d-NMA, a negative control ofl-NMA, suggests that RSV-tat induced the production of NO in U373MG astroglial cells through NOS-mediated arginine metabolism (Table I). To study the dose dependence of RSV-tat on the induction of NO production, cells plated in 6-well plates were transfected with RSV-tat at different doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 μg. The induction of NO production started at 0.05 μg of RSV-tat, reached the maximum at 0.2 μg of RSV-tat, and decreased at higher doses (Fig.1 A). This decrease in NO production was due to the increase in astroglial cell death when transfected at higher doses of RSV-tat (data not shown). In contrast, cells transfected with different doses of RSV-CAT were unable to induce the production of NO (Fig. 1 A) suggesting that the induction of NO production is due to the expression of thetat gene. To understand the mechanism of NO production, we examined the effect of RSV-tat and RSV-CAT on protein and mRNA levels of iNOS. For Northern blot analysis, cell plated in 100-mm dishes were transfected with different doses of either RSV-CAT or RSV-tat (Fig. 1 C). Consistent with the induction of NO production, Western blot analysis with antibodies against murine macrophage iNOS and Northern blot analysis for iNOS mRNA clearly showed that expression of RSV-CAT alone did not induce the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA. However, marked expression of iNOS protein (Fig. 1 B) and mRNA (Fig.1 C) was observed in cells transfected with different doses of RSV-tat. Similar to the induction of NO production, the expression of iNOS protein and mRNA by RSV-tat was also dose-dependent. The induction of iNOS protein was maximal in cells transfected with 0.2 μg (per well of 6-well plate) of RSV-tat (Fig. 1 B), whereas the expression of iNOS mRNA was maximal in cells transfected with 0.8 μg (100-mm dish) of RSV-tat (Fig. 1 C).Table IExpression of RSV-tat induces the production of NO in human U373MG astroglial cellsTransfections and treatmentsNitriteμg/mg protein/24 hRSV-CAT (0.2 μg)4.9 ± 0.5RSV-tat (0.2 μg)36.2 ± 4.1RSV-tat (0.2 μg) + arginase6.7 ± 0.4RSV-tat (0.2 μg) +l-NMA6.2 ± 0.8RSV-tat (0.2 μg) +d-NMA35.7 ± 4.5Cells plated at 50–60% confluence in 6-well plates were transfected with 0.2 μg of either RSV-CAT or RSV-tat using LipofectAMINE Plus (Invitrogen) as described under “Materials and Methods.” After 24 h of transfection, cells were incubated under serum-free conditions in the presence or absence of l-NMA (0.1 mm), d-NMA (0.1 mm), and arginase (100 units/ml).

In the CNS, only microglia is known to be infected productively by HIV-1 and to secrete the HIV-1 regulatory protein, Tat (2Bagasra O. Lavi E. Bobroski L. Khalili K. Pestaner J.B. Pomerantz R.J.

Sci. 1995; 2: 189-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Therefore, to understand whether Tat protein is secreted from RSV-tat-transfected astroglial cells and whether Tat protein is in fact responsible for the induction of iNOS, we incubated RSV-tat-transfected cells with anti-Tat antibodies. Although anti-Tat antibodies at a dose of 1 μg/ml was not very effective in blocking the induction of NO production, about 50% inhibition of NO production was observed when RSV-tat-transfected cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml anti-Tat antibodies (Fig.2 A). In contrast, control IgG had no effect on the induction of NO production. We next examined whether exogenously added recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein is able to induce the production of NO. Consistent with the induction of NO production by RSV-tat, recombinant Tat protein also dose-dependently induced the production of NO with the maximum induction observed at 100 ng/ml (Fig. 2 B). However, in contrast to the 8–9-fold induction of NO production by the expression of RSV-tat (Fig. 1 A), recombinant Tat protein induced the production of NO by about 4-fold (Fig.2 B). Taken together, these observations suggest that the induction of iNOS in RSV-tat-transfected astroglial cells is due to Tat and that Tat protein is secreted from RSV-tat-transfected astroglial cells. Human primary astrocytes have been shown to induce the expression of iNOS in the presence of different proinflammatory cytokines (23Pahan K. Liu X. Wood C. Raymond J.R. FEBS Lett. 2000; 472: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 24Pahan K. Liu X. McKinney M.J. Wood C. Sheikh F.G. Raymond J.R. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 2288-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).2 Because HIV-1tat gene induced the production of NO in human U373MG astroglial cells, we examined whether HIV-1 tat gene was also able to induce the production of NO in human primary astrocytes (Fig. 3). Consistent with the induction of NO production in human U373MG astroglial cells, expression of RSV-tat but not RSV-CAT (the control plasmid) dose-dependently induced the production of NO in human primary astroglia. The induction of NO was maximum at 0.2 μg of RSV-tat and decreased at higher concentration (Fig.3). To understand the effect of thetat gene on the transcription of iNOS, U373MG glial cells were cotransfected with phiNOS(7.2)Luc, a construct containing the human iNOS promoter fused to the luciferase gene,2 and either RSV-tat or RSV-CAT. Activation of the iNOS promoter was measured after incubating the cells with serum-free media. It is evident from Fig. 4 that transfection of cells with different amounts of RSV-tat but not RSV-CAT led to the induction of iNOS promoter-derived luciferase activity. About 3.7-fold activation of iNOS promoter-derived luciferase activity was observed in cells transfected with 0.2 μg of RSV-tat (Fig.4). These results suggest that the induction rate of the human iNOS promoter construct is much lower than the induction rate of human iNOS mRNA expression (Fig. 1 C). We used a 7.2-kb human iNOS promoter for this study. Earlier, Taylor et al. (34Taylor B.S. de Vera M.E. Ganster R.W. Wang Q. Shapiro R.A. Morris S.M. Billiar T.R. Geller D.A. J. Biol.

SHPS-1 also regulates intercellular communication in the neural and immune systems through its association with CD47 (integrin-associated protein) on adjacent cells. Furthermore, recent studies with fibroblasts derived from mice expressing an SHPS-1 mutant that lacks most of the cytoplasmic region suggested that the intact protein contributes to cytoskeletal function. Mice homozygous for this SHPS-1 mutation have now been shown to manifest thrombocytopenia. These animals did not exhibit a defect in megakaryocytopoiesis or in platelet production. However, platelets were cleared from the bloodstream more rapidly in the mutant mice than in wild-type animals. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages from the mutant mice phagocytosed red blood cells more effectively than did those from wild-type mice; in addition, they exhibited an increase both in the rate of cell spreading and in the formation of filopodia-like structures at the cell periphery. These results indicate that SHPS-1 both contributes to the survival of circulating platelets and down-regulates the macrophage phagocytic response.

Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). SHPS-1-CD47 interaction also promotes the adhesion of cerebellar neurons (12Jiang P. Lagenaur C.F. Narayanan V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 559-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and modifies synaptic activity in the retina (27Mi Z.P. Jiang P. Weng W.L. Lindberg F.P. Narayanan V. Lagenaur C.F. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 416: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, SHPS-1 appears to interact with CD47 on adjacent cells and thereby regulates various cellular responses in the neural and immune systems. The biological consequences of this interactionin vivo, however, remain to be clarified.We recently generated mice that lack most of the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1. Characterization of immortalized fibroblasts from these mice revealed important roles for SHPS-1 in both integrin-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and the down-regulation of growth factor-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades (28Inagaki K. Yamao T. Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Fukunaga K. Takada T. Hosooka T. Akira S. Kasuga M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6721-6731Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To elucidate further the physiological roles of SHPS-1, we have now characterized the phenotype of the SHPS-1 mutant mice. The mutant animals were found to exhibit thrombocytopenia, which results from an increased rate of clearance of circulating platelets. Furthermore, peritoneal macrophages (PEMs) from these mice exhibit an enhanced phagocytic response.DISCUSSIONWe recently generated mutant mice that express a truncated form of SHPS-1 lacking most of the cytoplasmic region of this protein. We have now characterized these mutant mice and demonstrated that the absence of the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 results in thrombocytopenia. This condition is attributable to an increased metabolism of circulating platelets, with platelet production being unaffected. Our results have also revealed an important role for the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 in down-regulation of the macrophage phagocytic response. However, we need to be cautious in interpreting these results given that the mutant mice would possess functional extracellular regions of SHPS-1 and thus represent a hypomorphic or neomorphic mutation as opposed to a true loss-of-function.The mice homozygous for the SHPS-1 mutation exhibited mild thrombocytopenia. Both the generation of megakaryocyte progenitors in bone marrow and the ability of these progenitors to grow and differentiate into mature polyploid megakaryocytes in this tissue appeared unaffected in the mutant mice. Furthermore, these animals exhibited no significant defect in the recovery of platelet counts after transient myelosuppression. In contrast, platelets were cleared from the bloodstream more rapidly in the mutant mice than in wild-type mice. Thus, the thrombocytopenia of the SHPS-1 mutant mice appears to be attributable, at least in part, to an increased rate of consumption of circulating platelets, and not to a defect in the production of these cells.At least two possible mechanisms could account for the accelerated clearance of circulating platelets in SHPS-1 mutant mice. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis has revealed the presence of SHPS-1 mRNA, albeit in small amounts, in platelets (data not shown). The deletion of the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 expressed in platelets might therefore increase the fragility of these cells and thereby render them more susceptible to destruction, although platelet functions such as aggregation in response to collagen or to ADP are not affected by the SHPS-1 mutation. 2T. Hagiwara, unpublished data. The second, and more likely, possibility is that the enhanced rate of platelet clearance in the mutant mice results from expression of the mutant SHPS-1 protein in other cell types. The sequestration of aged platelets is mediated by phagocytosis within the reticuloendothelial system, especially by splenic and hepatic macrophages (35Neiman J.C. Mant M.J. Shnitka T.K. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1987; 111: 563-565PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, thrombocytopenia with abnormal platelet sequestration has been observed in various diseases including sepsis syndrome (36Francois B. Trimoreau F. Vignon P. Fixe P. Praloran V. Gastinne H. Am. J. Med. 1997; 103: 114-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) and chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura (37McMillan R. Semin. Hematol. 2000; 37: 239-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Administration of cytokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor and macrophage colony stimulating factor also results in either the clearance of circulating platelets or the stimulation of megakaryocytopoiesis, presumably by activating the monocyte-macrophage system (38Vannucchi A.M. Grossi A. Rafanelli D. Ferrini P.R. Blood. 1990; 76: 1473-1480Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Nash R.A. Burstein S.A. Storb R. Yang W. Abrams K. Appelbaum F.R. Boone T. Deeg H.J. Durack L.D.

Given the fact that SHPS-1 is abundant in monocytes-macrophages and that this protein negatively regulates cytokine synthesis (21Lienard H. Bruhns P. Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32493-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), enhanced phagocytosis or cytokine production by monocytes-macrophages is likely responsible for the thrombocytopenia in SHPS-1 mutant mice.In splenic macrophages, SHPS-1 generates an intracellular signal that inhibits phagocytosis of RBCs (25Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 26Oldenborg P.A. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) in a manner that depends both on the binding of its extracellular IgV-like domain to CD47 expressed by the RBCs and on the recruitment of SHP-1 to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs of SHPS-1 (19Gresham H.D. Dale B.M. Potter J.W. Chang P.W. Vines C.M. Lowell C.A. Lagenaur C.F. Willman C.L. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 515-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 25Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 26Oldenborg P.A. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). CD47 engagement of macrophage SHPS-1 has also been shown to prevent the clearance of lymphohematopoietic cells (41Blazar B.R. Lindberg F.P. Ingulli E. Panoskaltsis-Mortari A. Oldenborg P.A. Iizuka K. Yokoyama W.M. Taylor P.A. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 194: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Given that the truncated SHPS-1 expressed in macrophages of the homozygous mutant mice is not able to bind SHP-1, these cells would not be expected to transmit the inhibitory signal initiated by the interaction with CD47. CD47 is abundant in platelets (42Brown E. Hooper L., Ho, T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 43Rosales C. Gresham H.D. Brown E.J. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 2759-2764PubMed Google Scholar). If the functional consequences of the interaction of macrophage SHPS-1 with CD47 expressed on platelets are similar to those of the interaction of macrophage SHPS-1 with CD47 on RBCs or lymphocytes, then platelets would be expected to be phagocytosed by splenic macrophages more effectively in SHPS-1 mutant mice.In agreement with the lack of a signal that prevents phagocytosis, the number of CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes in spleen was reduced in SHPS-1 mutant mice. In these mice, however, we failed to detect any sign of accelerated RBC clearance such as anemia and reticulocytosis. Also, no marked reduction in the survival ratio of transfused RBCs was observed in the mutant mice. 3T. Yamao, unpublished data. These results appear inconsistent with what might have been predicted from the previous reports (25Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 26Oldenborg P.A. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). This apparent discrepancy presumably results from the difference in the experimental approach adopted; whereas we mutated SHPS-1 to interrupt the inhibitory signal by CD47, Oldenborg et al. (25Oldenborg P.A. Zheleznyak A. Fang Y.F. Lagenaur C.F. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. Science. 2000; 288: 2051-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 26Oldenborg P.A. Gresham H.D. Lindberg F.P. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 855-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) followed the fate of RBCs deficient in CD47. Redundant pathways may also explain the difference in phenotype between the SHPS-1 and CD47 mutant mice. Nevertheless, ourex vivo analyses have demonstrated that PEMs from SHPS-1 mutant mice phagocytosed RBCs more effectively than did wild-type cells, supporting the notion that the cytoplasmic region of SHPS-1 negatively regulates the macrophage phagocytic response.PEMs from SHPS-1 mutant mice are reminiscent of macrophages (44Roach T.I. Slater S.E. White L.S. Zhang X. Majerus P.W. Brown E.J. Thomas M.L. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1035-1038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), lymphocytes (45Kim C.H., Qu, C.K. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), or neutrophils (46Kruger J. Butler J.R. Cherapanov V. Dong Q. Ginzberg H. Govindarajan A. Grinstein S. Siminovitch K.A. Downey G.P. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5847-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) from SHP-1-deficient mice, in that they manifest an increase in the actin polymerization. Although this similarity suggests that the inability of the truncated SHPS-1 to recruit SHP-1 might partly account for the phenotype of the mutant PEMs, the mechanism by which SHPS-1 truncation stimulates phagocytosis remains unclear. Rac1 and Cdc42 positively regulate Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages (33Caron E. Hall A. Science. 1998; 282: 1717-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar, 34Massol P. Montcourrier P. Guillemot J.C. Chavrier P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6219-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), indicating that up-regulation of the small GTPases might play a causal role. We could not, however, provide direct evidence for this hypothesis presumably because of the low stoichiometry and transient nature of the activation of these GTPases in PEMs. This idea nevertheless appears consistent with the observation that cell spreading and filopodia formation, which correlate well with the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42, were enhanced in SHPS-1-deficient macrophages. Phagocytosis and Rac-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization also require the participation of another low molecular weight GTPase, ARF6 (47Greenberg S. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1999; 66: 712-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 48Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 875-877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that Rac1 and/or Cdc42 activity is unaffected by the SHPS-1 mutation and that it may instead be regulating ARF6.The number of splenic megakaryocytes in SHPS-1 mutant mice ∼11 weeks after birth was markedly increased compared with that in wild-type controls, suggesting that megakaryocytopoiesis in the spleen might be transiently activated as a consequence of the deletion of the SHPS-1 cytoplasmic region. This observation appears inconsistent with ourin vitro data showing that the growth rate of spleen-derived megakaryocyte progenitors from SHPS-1 mutant mice is increased only slightly. A likely explanation is that the relative contribution of SHPS-1 to megakaryocytopoiesis is greater in vivo thanin vitro. Under the former conditions, megakaryocytopoiesis might be supported more extensively by cytokines secreted by leukocytes into the microenvironment surrounding megakaryocyte progenitors. Given that SHPS-1 inhibits cytokine synthesis by leukocytes (21Lienard H. Bruhns P. Malbec O. Fridman W.H. Daeron M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32493-32499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), its cytoplasmic truncation might reverse this inhibition and thus facilitate megakaryocytopoiesis in the spleen. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that SHPS-1 inhibits the clearance of circulating platelets as well as down-regulates the macrophage phagocytic response, thereby possibly contributing to hemostasis and host defense. SHPS-1 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is abundant in neural and myeloid tissues (1Fujioka Y. Matozaki T. Noguchi T. Iwamatsu A. Yamao T. Takahashi N. Tsuda M. Takada T. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell.

G-protein-coupled receptor high potassium transmembrane group of overlapping clones somatostatin SST receptor high pressure liquid chromatography Insect development and behavior are largely controlled by hormones and neurotransmitters often identified using a diverse array of bioassays. Besides the biogenic amines and the steroid-like hormones, insect hormones have been frequently classified as neuropeptides, which are widely distributed throughout the invertebrate kingdom (1Gade G. Hoffmann K.H. Spring J.H. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 963-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 2Nassel D.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 273: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Despite the large number of neuropeptides, the number of known cognate receptors in insects is still rather limited, with only a few examples in Drosophila that have been cloned based on homology with mammalian G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 (i.e.neuropeptide Y-like and tachykinin-like receptors) (3Li X.J., Wu, Y.N. North R.A. Forte M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Monnier D. Colas J.F. Rosay P. Hen R. Borrelli E. Maroteaux L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1298-1302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With the completion of the Drosophila genome project, a more thorough analysis of neuropeptide/receptor relations in insects is now possible. Whereas this genome data base allows the identification of peptide hormones previously isolated from other insect species as part of larger precursors (5Vanden Broeck J. Peptides. 2001; 22: 241-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), Drosophila GPCR-like sequences have been predicted mostly based on structural analogy of the transmembrane regions to mammalian neuropeptide receptor groups (6Brody T. Cravchik A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Structural evidence for the existence of ligands identical or similar to their mammalian neuropeptide counterparts are lacking when searching the Drosophila genome data base. This may indicate that in insects these receptors are activated by an entirely different set of ligands. This view is supported by data reported here on the identification of two novel GPCRs from Drosophila melanogaster, termed Drostar1 and -2, which are structurally related to the mammalian opioid/somatostatin receptor family yet are activated by peptide ligands, pyro-Glu- and Gln-allatostatin C, unrelated to any known mammalian agonists. Several PCR primers were designed to amplify SST-like receptor cDNAs from Drosophila RNA (7Birgul N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); 5′-atggatccatgacagccgattcagagg-3′ and 5′-taaagcttttacaaatctgtctgctgc-3′ were used to amplify a 1.4-kb cDNA corresponding to the CG7285 gene product of the Drosophila genome data base. 5′-gtctgcatcattggactctttg-3′ and 5′-ttttctagattataagtccgtgtggagcacg-3′ were used to amplify a central fragment of the CG13702 gene product. Based on the putative 3′ end of the coding region of this gene (predicted by similarity to the CG7285 gene product), we used primers 5′-gtctgcatcattggactctttg-3′ and 5′-gtctgcatcattggactctttg-3′ to amplify the 3′-end of this cDNA. The 5′-end of this cDNA was obtained by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (7Birgul N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All PCR fragments were cloned into TOPO vectors (Invitrogen) and sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by PCR using mutagenic primers and Vent DNA polymerase. Wild type and mutant receptor cDNAs were cloned into a modified pGEMHE expression vector, which carries a sequence coding for the signal peptide of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3 (amino acid sequence MVLWLQLALLALLLPTSLAQGEVDI); the pGEMHE vector itself contains 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions derived from the Xenopus laevisglobin gene, which stabilize exogenous RNA in Xenopusoocytes (8Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). After linearization of the vector with NheI, cRNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase and coinjected with the mouse GIRK1 cRNA into Xenopus oocytes (7Birgul N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced potassium currents were recorded in high potassium (hK) solution under whole cell voltage clamp conditions (7Birgul N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). For the testing of fractions obtained by various chromatographic steps, aliquots were lyophilized and dissolved in hK buffer. Crude peptide extracts from adult flies and a mixture of larvae and pupae (both about 50 ml of material) were prepared by homogenizing frozen animals in 200 ml of 0.5m acetic acid, 10 mm ascorbic acid on ice; the homogenate was incubated in boiling water for 10 min and again incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (30,000 × g, 30 min) followed by filtration of the supernatant fraction. The extract was then applied to C-18 reverse phase material; after washing with water plus 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, peptides were eluted with 80% methanol and lyophilized. A crude purification of this extract was achieved by gel filtration using a Sephadex G-25 column (43 × 1.4 cm; in 0.1 macetic acid); active fractions from both the adult flies and the larvae/pupae mixture were pooled and further purified using Vydac C-8, C-18, C4, and Nucleosil C-8 (two times) reverse phase HPLC columns. Peptide sequences were determined by standard Edman degradation using an automatic pulsed-liquid protein sequencer (476A; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mass spectroscopic analysis was performed with a hybrid tandem mass spectrometer (QTOF II; Micromass, Manchester, UK) equipped with a nanoelectrospray ion source. Samples were purified by binding to C18 reverse phase material in a pipette tip (ZipTip; Millipore Corp.) and eluted with 1 μl of 50% methanol, 5% formic acid into a gold-coated borosilicate vial for nanoelectrospray measurements. Synthetic, linear Gln-allatostatin C (QVRYRQCYFNPISCF) was obtained by custom synthesis from Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). For oxidation, the peptide was treated with K3Fe(CN)6 (9Walker C.S. Steel D. Jacobsen R.B. Lirazan M.B. Cruz L.J. Hooper D. Shetty R. DelaCruz R.C. Nielsen J.S. Zhou L.M. Bandyopadhyay P. Craig A.G. Olivera B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30664-30671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) for reduction with 1 mm dithiothreitol (30 min, 65 °C). Conversion of linear Gln-allatostatin C peptide into pyro-Glu-allatostatin C was achieved with glacial acetic acid at 95 °C for 60 min, followed by K3Fe(CN)6 oxidation as above. The purity and the identity of active agonists was then determined by reverse phase HPLC as well as by mass spectroscopy. Heads of adult flies were snap frozen in Tissue Tek (Sakura, Tokyo, Japan). Sections (10 μm) were dried for 1 h at room temperature and postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 10. Washing was performed with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.3% Triton X-100. Prehybridization was done with Ultrahyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) supplemented with salmon sperm and tRNA for 2 h at 60 °C. cRNA was in vitro transcribed (Ambion) with digoxigenin UTP. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 60 °C in prehybridization buffer followed by immunohistochemical detection with alkaline phosphatase-labeled anti-digoxigenin antibodies (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Paraformaldehyde-fixed and frozen sections from last instar larvae were processed for immunocytochemistry (10Buchner E. Buchner S. Burg M.G. Hofbauer A. Pak W.L. Pollack I. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 273: 119-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Manduca sextaallatostatin C antibody (primary antibody) was diluted 1000-fold, and secondary antibody (Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was diluted 200-fold. Fluorescence was visualized using a Leica DM-IRBE microscope equipped for epifluorescence. When screening theDrosophila genome data base with mammalian somatostatin or opioid receptors as probes, two highly similar sequences partially overlapping with the predicted CG7285 and CG13702 gene products were detected on a contig (accession number AE003520) derived from chromosome 3L. Using total RNA isolated from adult flies and primers based on conserved regions of the mammalian SSTR2 and on the coding sequences predicted from the Drosophila genome project annotation data base, we isolated and sequenced cDNAs coding for both receptors by reverse transcriptase-PCR. The CG7285 cDNA could be amplified using forward and reverse primers directed at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the predicted coding sequences; this was not possible for the CG13702 cDNA, since both ends of the coding region were incorrectly predicted. Here primers for the 3′-end were designed based on similarity to the CG7285 gene product, whereas the 5′-end of the cDNA was determined by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Open reading frames of 1401 bp (CG7285) and 1467 bp (CG13702) were detected, coding for proteins of 467 and 489 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1). The deduced protein sequences exhibit the characteristic pattern of GPCRs (seven TMs;N-linked glycosylation sites at the N terminus). Both receptors share 60% identical amino acid residues; considering only the TMs, this value increases to 76%, strongly suggesting that the two receptors are distinct members of a novel GPCR subfamily. When comparing both sequences with GPCRs present in the GenBankTM data base, mammalian SSTR2 appears as the closest relative (42% amino acid identity in the TMs), followed by the other SSTR subtypes and then the opioid receptors (Fig.2). Other insect receptors (AlstR1 and -2) appear closer to the mammalian galanin receptor family.Figure 2Evolutionary relationship betweenDrosophila receptors CG7285 and CG13702 and mammalian GPCRs for somatostatin (SSTR1–5), opioids and galanin (Gal11–3), andDrosophila GPCRs for allatostatin A (AlstR1 and -2). All sequences were obtained from GenBankTM. Thelengths of the horizontal linesindicate reciprocally the sequence similarities. The bar at the bottom corresponds to a mutation rate of 10 bases per 100 residues. Amino acid alignments were generated using the PileUp software in the GCG package. Evolutionary distances were then calculated using the Distances program (GCG), and the phylogenetic tree was reconstructed using the GrowTree program. D,Drosophila; h, human.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Functional expression in Xenopusoocytes was achieved by coinjection of CG7285 cRNA together with GIRK1 cRNA. Significant signals were recorded when oocytes expressing the novel Drosophila receptor were exposed to a crude peptide extract from Drosophila larvae or adult flies (Fig.3 A). Since weaker signals were also recorded from oocytes expressing the GIRK1 channel alone, the specificity of signals could only be ascertained after Sephadex G-25 gel filtration of the crude peptide extracts (Fig. 3 B). Signals could be detected in fractions corresponding to a molecular mass of about 1000–2000 Da; these signals were specific, since they were not observed with oocytes expressing the GIRK1 channel only. Active fractions were further purified by reverse phase HPLC (Vydac C-8 column). The activity was eluted as two distinct peaks (Fig.4 A), which were purified separately. After three further reverse phase HPLC steps, the first (slightly more hydrophilic) active ligand was finally isolated in an apparently pure peptide fraction, as judged by UV absorbance of the HPLC elution profile (Fig. 4 B). Analyzed by Edman degradation, this peptide revealed the sequenceXVRYRQXYFNPIX. TableI A shows that this sequence aligns with part of a hormone precursor sequence derived from theDrosophila genome data base and referred to as Drostatin precursor (11Williamson M. Lenz C. Winther A.M. Nassel D.R. Grimmelikhuijzen C.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The resulting decapentapeptide is reminiscent to allatostatin C isolated from the tobacco hornworm, M. sexta(12Kramer S.J. Toschi A. Miller C.A. Kataoka H. Quistad G.B., Li, J.P. Carney R.L. Schooley D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9458-9462Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), except that in Manduca the first amino acid residue is a pyroglutamate, and in position 4 the tyrosine is replaced by phenylalanine (Table I B). Our ability to sequence theDrosophila agonist of peak 1 (Fig. 4 B) by Edman degradation indicated that the pyro-Glu modification was not present in the purified peptide. In agreement with this, mass spectroscopy of the pure peptide yielded a peptide mass of 1920.67, which corresponds to the predicted mass of the unmodified (but Cys-oxidized) peptide starting with a glutamine (Table I B).Table IIdentification of the native agonists of the Drosophila receptors Open table in a new tab The second peptide peak (Fig. 4) was purified accordingly, but due to its rather low abundance when compared with peak 1 it was analyzed by mass spectroscopy; the detected peptide mass of 1903.26 corresponded to the decapentapeptide carrying an N-terminal pyroglutamate, indicating that Drosophila contains two types of allatostatin C carrying N-terminally either a glutamine or a pyroglutamate; they are present in the peptide extract with an estimated ratio (in terms of agonistic activity) of 1:2 (pyro-Glu-allatostatin C/Gln-allatostatin C; see Fig. 4 A). Accordingly, the two receptors were termed Drostar1 and -2 (for Dro sophilaallatostatin C receptors 1 and 2). To verify our findings that the deduced sequences of the decapentapeptides are indeed that of the agonists of Drostar1 and -2, the linear Gln-allatostatin C peptide was custom-synthesized and tested for ligand activity. The linear peptide as obtained after synthesis yielded a rather low receptor-induced potassium current in theXenopus system. However, after oxidation of the two cysteine residues (positions 7 and 14), strong agonist-induced currents were obtained, which were specific to oocytes expressing either Drostar1 or -2 and GIRK1 but which were not observed with oocytes expressing either GIRK1 alone or SSTR2/GIRK1 (Fig. 5,A–C). Strong currents were also induced by the peptide after generation of the N-terminal pyro-Glu modification, followed again by peptide oxidation. A comparison of HPLC elution profiles of synthetic, oxidized peptide carrying N-terminally either the pyro-Glu or Gln showed that the pyro-Glu peptide version elutes about 2 min later from a reverse phase Vydac C-8 HPLC column (data not shown), confirming that the second peak of agonistic activity obtained during the purification procedure (Fig. 4 B) is theDrosophila pyro-Glu-allatostatin C reminiscent of theM. sexta peptide. The reduced form of the Gln-allatostatin C peptide exhibited a potency that was about 100-fold lower than that of the oxidized form. To test whether the two Drostars discriminate between Gln- and pyro-Glu-allatostatin C peptides, dose-response curves were recorded. Both peptides were almost equally active at both receptors with EC50 values for GIRK1 activation in the low nanomolar range (Gln-allatostatin C: 9.45 nm at Drostar1, 7.0 nm at Drostar2; pyro-Glu-allatostatin C: 25.4 nm at Drostar1, 8.7 nm at Drostar2; Fig.5 B), suggesting that the modification at the N terminus of allatostatin C does not contribute significantly to the ligand binding affinity toward its receptors. As known from other peptides starting with a pyroglutamate, the corresponding amino acid in the respective precursor sequence is always a glutamine (Table I A), suggesting that Drostatin is converted into both types of allatostatin C. The reason for the presence of more unprotected versusprotected allatostatin C in Drosophila is at present not quite clear. It may reflect that the capacity to produce pyro-Glu-allatostatin C is restricted to a limited number of cells. The affinity and ligand specificity of mammalian somatostatin receptors are determined by residues in transmembrane region 3 (TM3; D124 in SSTR3 (13Nehring R.B. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar)) and in those portions of TM6 and -7 facing the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (14Kaupmann K. Bruns C. Raulf F. Weber H.P. Mattes H. Lubbert H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These residues in Drostar1 were changed into the corresponding residues of the SSTR2 sequence by site-directed mutagenesis, and recombinant receptors were challenged with pyro-Glu-allatostatin C and somatostatin 14. A point mutation in TM3 reduced the affinity of Drostar1 about 3-fold (Fig.6), whereas a Drostar1 mutant carrying SSTR2 sequence from the middle of TM6 to the middle of TM7 was not activated by allatostatin C at all concentrations tested. Neither mutant nor wild type receptors were activated by SST14 (data not shown). It should be noted that when constructs were transfected into human embryonic kidney cells, there were no differences in the localization pattern between wild type and mutant receptors, indicating that the transport to the cell surface was not impaired by the mutations (data not shown). Both Drostars are encoded by distinct genes located very close to each other at a distance of about 80 kb with no other genes predicted between them (Fig. 7). The open reading frames of both genes are directed in opposite directions; both receptor mRNAs are transcribed from three exons, including a small exon with 48 bp in size that codes for a part of the sixth transmembrane region (Fig. 1). Exon/intron boundaries, as deduced by comparison with the genomic sequence, are entirely conserved between both receptors. Although receptor-coding transcripts were predicted for both the 138-kb region (CG13702) and the 224-kb region (CG7285) of this part of theDrosophila genome by the GADFLY data base, predictions for both genes proved to be inaccurate, since the small exon was apparently missed in each case by the prediction software used; in the case of Drostar2, both the N- and C-terminal part were also not correctly assigned (see data base entry, accession number AE003520). In situ hybridization experiments revealed expression of both Drostar genes within the optic lobes of adult flies, an area devoted to the processing of visual information (Fig.8 A). In the lamina region, these cells might represent lamina monopolar cells, the main cellular components of the neuropil (15Fischbach K.-F. Dittrich A.P.M. Cell Tissue Res. 1989; 258: 441-475Crossref Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In addition, a region in the anterior median part of the brain, the pars intercerebralis, has also few Drostar-expressing cells. Since allatostatin C is also present in the pars intercerebralis (16Zitnan D. Sehnal F. Bryant P.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), the Drostar receptors on these cells might be involved in autoregulatory processes. In addition, a group of cells at the dorsal margin of the optic lobes also displayed allatostatin C-like immunoreactivity (16Zitnan D. Sehnal F. Bryant P.J. Dev. Biol. 1993; 156: 117-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which may project to Drostar-expressing cells of the optic lobe. The presence of both the peptide and the receptor in the optic lobes suggests a function in the modulation of visual information processing. Interestingly, the disperse labeling within the neuropil regions indicates Drostar expression in glial cells (Fig. 8 A, arrowheads). In larvae, Drostar expression was detected only in few cells of the nervous system (Fig. 8 B). In contrast, immunolabeling of the peptide was found in the brain and corpora allata of the larvae, presumably on axon terminals arising from the pars intercerebralis of the brain (Fig. 8 C). The allatostatin C peptide may be released from these terminals into the hemolymph or onto the corpora allata; thus, allatostatin C might function as the main allatostatic activity in Drosophila. In agreement, injection of pyro-Glu allatostatin C into the hemolymph of second instar larvae led to a slightly shortened time until they undergo pupariation (data not shown). The data presented here identify two novel receptors, Drostar1 and -2, from the fruit fly and their cognate ligands as pyro-Glu-allatostatin C and Gln-allatostatin C. Different peptides have been described as allatostatins based on their ability to inhibit juvenile hormone synthesis from the retrocerebral corpora allata complex of insects. They can be grouped into the allatostatin subfamilies A, B, and C. Members of subfamily A share the conserved C-terminal peptide motif YXFGL-amide, whereas their N terminus may vary in sequence and length. As reported, the conserved pentapeptide is sufficient to activate the cognate invertebrate AlstR1 and -2 receptors (7Birgul N. Weise C. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5892-5900Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 17Auerswald L. Birgul N. Gade G. Kreienkamp H.J. Richter D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 904-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Members of the allatostatin B peptide family are characterized by the C-terminal motifXWXXXXXXW-amide. Neither of the two sequence motifs are present in the allatostatin C peptides of M. sexta or Drosophila. Thus, only the allatostatin C peptides activate the two Drostars, whereas no cross-activation of the two receptors occurs when complemented with allatostatin A peptides (Table II); conversely, AlstR1 is not activated by allatostatin C. As in M. sexta, our immunocytochemical data show that in Drosophila allatostatin C is present in the corpora allata presumably on axon terminals arising from the pars intercerebralis of the brain (Fig. 8), pointing to an allatostatic function. Using antibodies against an allatostin A-type peptide allatostatin-like immunoreactivity in Drosophila has been reported earlier mainly in nerve cells but not in fibers terminating on the corpora allata (18Yoon J.G. Stay B. J. Comp. Neurol. 1995; 363: 475-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), also suggesting that inDrosophila allatostatin C rather than an allatostatin A is involved in the regulation of juvenile hormone synthesis. This assumption is supported by the observation that second instar larvae injected with allatostatin C show a slightly shortened period until they start pupariation. On the other hand, pyro-Glu allatostatin C does not reduce neurotransmitter release at the larval neuromuscular junction, indicating that Drostars are not located presynaptically on glutamatergic terminals. 2M. Heckmann, personal communication. Clearly, the final elucidation of the physiological function of the ligand-Drostar system in the fly remains to be solved in the future. Genetic means may be the alternative approach by using, for instance, the chimeric Drostar receptor (Fig. 6) as a dominant negative construct for generating transgenic flies.Table IISequence comparison and agonistic activity of insect allatostatin peptides (AI) and mammalian agonists for somatostatin/opioid receptors Open table in a new tab Structurally, the two Drostars are most closely related to the mammalian opioid/somatostatin receptor family; homology between Drostar1 and -2 described here and their mammalian counterparts is remarkably high in those parts of the transmembrane regions facing the cytosol (i.e. that part where the receptors couple to their associated heterotrimeric G-proteins). In accordance with this observation, both Drostars and mammalian opioid and SST receptors can be coupled to the same intracellular pathway in Xenopusoocytes (i.e. activation of GIRK1 currents presumably via Gi/o subunits). In contrast, those portions of the TMs facing the extracellular side are less well conserved, in keeping with their role in agonist binding and specificity. As depicted in Table II, the natural agonists of Drostars, pyro-Glu- and Gln-allatostatin C, bear only superficial similarity to somatostatin-14, since they are rather similar in their molecular weights (14 versus 15 amino acid residues) and also in carrying a disulfide loop absent in all other known allatostatin peptides and essential for high affinity to the Drostar receptors. Otherwise, there is no detectable sequence similarity between the allatostatin C peptides and SST-14. The affinity and ligand specificity of mammalian somatostatin receptors are determined by two sites; one consists of a single aspartate residue in transmembrane region 3 (TM3; Asp124 in SSTR3) (13Nehring R.B. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and the other consists of a region between TM6 and -7 facing the extracellular side of the plasma membrane (14Kaupmann K. Bruns C. Raulf F. Weber H.P. Mattes H. Lubbert H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The aspartate residue of the SSTR is part of a narrow and selective pocket that forms an ion pair with the positively charged lysine residue at position 4 or 9 of somatostatin (13Nehring R.B. Meyerhof W. Richter D. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; 14: 939-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the somatostatin-like receptors ofDrosophila, Drostar1 and 2, this aspartate is replaced by threonine (Thr140). When converting this residue into an aspartate by site-directed mutagenesis, the recombinant Drostar1 receptor showed a 3-fold reduced affinity for pyro-Glu-allatostatin C; no activity was observed with somatostatin 14. A Drostar1 chimeric mutant carrying the second binding pocket of SSTR2 from the middle of TM6 to the middle of TM7 was activated by neither pyro-Glu-allatostatin C nor somatostatin 14 at all concentrations tested. Accordingly, there is no cross-reactivity between the Drostar and the SSTR ligand/receptor systems even in the mutant constructs. This suggests that during evolution of this group of receptors, a common scaffold of a receptor protein coupled to inhibitory G-proteins appears to be maintained, whereas the extracellular parts facing the ligand are rather variable in order to accommodate different peptide ligands. Both SSTRs and Drostars presumably use part of TM3 and the extracellular portions of TM6 and TM7 to accommodate their agonists, as is underlined by our mutagenesis study. Since the Drostars are the closest relatives of mammalian SST/opioid receptors but are not activated by these peptides (Table II), it may be speculated that neither opioid nor SST-like peptides exist inDrosophila. This view is supported by our inability to identify SST or opioid precursor-like sequences in theDrosophila genome data base (data not shown), although exon-intron boundaries within a predicted peptide may complicate such a search. As a conclusion, whereas many receptors from vertebrates have a structural analog in invertebrates (6Brody T. Cravchik A. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), the latter may use an entirely different set of peptides to activate these receptors. For a functional annotation of the many receptor sequences generated in genome projects such as those for D. melanogaster or Caenorhabditis elegans, it may therefore in many cases become necessary to identify the physiological ligands of novel receptors by the reverse pharmacology approach that has been used here.

To determine the role of EGFR and FAK survival signaling in breast cancer, EGFR was stably overexpressed in BT474 breast cancer cells, and each signaling pathway was specifically targeted for inhibition. FAK and EGFR constitutively co-immunoprecipitated in EGFR-overexpressing BT474 cells. In low EGFR-expressing BT474-pcDNA3 vector control cells, inhibition of FAK by the FAK C-terminal domain caused detachment and apoptosis via pathways involving activation of caspase-3 and -8, cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, and caspase-3-dependent degradation of AKT. This apoptosis could be rescued by the dominant-negative Fas-associated death domain, indicating involvement of the death receptor pathway. EGFR overexpression did not inhibit detachment induced by the FAK C-terminal domain, but did suppress apoptosis, activating AKT and ERK1/2 survival pathways and inhibiting cleavage of FAK, caspase-3 and -8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Furthermore, this protective effect of EGFR signaling was reversed by EGFR kinase inhibition with AG1478. In addition, inhibition of FAK and EGFR in another breast cancer cell line (BT20) endogenously overexpressing these kinases also induced apoptosis via the same mechanism as in the EGFR-overexpressing BT474 cells. The results of this study indicate that dual inhibition of FAK and EGFR signaling pathways can cooperatively enhance apoptosis in breast cancers.

The process of metastasis requires a disseminating cancer cell to survive an environment that actively promotes apoptosis. Thus, for a cancer cell to effectively metastasize, it must possess survival signals that suppress apoptosis. One survival signal that has recently been shown to modulate apoptotic signaling is the focal adhesion kinase (FAK)1 (1Xu L.-H. Owens L.V. Sturge G.C. Yang X. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 413-418PubMed Google Scholar, 2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol.

FAK was originally isolated as a tyrosine-phosphorylated 125-kDa protein in v-Src-transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts (6Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

FAK includes an N-terminal domain with a primary autophosphorylation site (Tyr397) that directly interacts with the Src homology-2 domain (8Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar); a central catalytic domain with major sites of phosphorylation (Tyr576/Tyr577); and a C-terminal domain with two proline-rich segments and a focal adhesion targeting subdomain, which binds paxillin, talin, and other proteins (4Hanks S.K.

Cell. 1995; 6: 637-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). FAK activity is regulated by extracellular matrix receptors and integrins and is involved in cellular processes such as spreading, motility, proliferation, and survival (4Hanks S.K. Polte T.R.

A non-catalytic domain of FAK, FAK-related nonkinase (FRNK; p41/p43), is expressed in chicken embryo cells (11Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 785-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), initiated from an alternative promoter and start site residing within an intron (12Nolan K. Lacoste J. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

FAK was shown to be overexpressed compared with normal tissue counterparts in many human tumors, including breast, colon, and thyroid carcinomas (15Weiner T.M. Liu E.T. Craven R.J. Cance W.G.

Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar), suggesting that one function of FAK is to promote survival in cells subjected to apoptotic signals. Consistent with this hypothesis, constitutively active forms of FAK prevent anoikis and stimulate transformation of epithelial cells, resulting in anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in nude mice (23Frisch S.M. Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. Chan-Hui P.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 793-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). Further evidence for the anti-apoptotic role of FAK was shown in the leukemic cell line HL-60, where FAK is associated with activation of NF-κB and inhibition of caspase-3 (24Sonoda Y. Matsumoto Y. Funakoshi M. Yamamoto D. Hanks S.K. Kasahara T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16309-16315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Conversely, caspase-3 and -6 may promote apoptosis in part by cleaving FAK and generating a C-terminal FRNK-like polypeptide (25Gervais F.G. Thornberry N.A. Ruffolo S.C. Nicholson D.W. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17102-17108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, FAK was shown to be associated with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), also known as ErbB-1 (26Lu Z. Jiang G. Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Mol. Cell.

Recent reports have suggested that FAK serves to integrate EGFR signals upon EGF induction, promoting tumor cell motility and invasion (22Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R. Ilic D. Klingbeil C.K. Schaefer E. Damsky C.H. Schlaepfer D.D. Nat. Cell. Biol. 2000; 2: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (1062) Google Scholar). However, another report suggests that FAK and EGFR are constitutively associated (26Lu Z. Jiang G. Blume-Jensen P. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4016-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Thus, the relationship between EGFR signaling and FAK expression and activity during progression from a noninvasive to an invasive and metastatic tumor phenotype is unknown, and their cooperation in preventing apoptosis has not been mechanistically examined. In this study, we examined the role of FAK and EGFR in survival signaling in a human breast cancer cell line model system of EGFR overexpression. We stably overexpressed EGFR in a cell line that endogenously overexpresses FAK (BT474-EGFR cells) to compare the effects of EGFR survival signaling with the parental cell line without EGFR (BT474-pcDNA3 cells). We have demonstrated that dual inhibition of FAK and EGFR cooperatively caused apoptosis in breast cancer cells. In breast cancer cells that stably overexpressed EGFR, there was a constitutive association between FAK and EGFR. Furthermore, EGFR signaling suppressed death receptor-mediated apoptosis induced by the FAK C-terminal domain (FAK-CD). The mechanism included activation of AKT and ERK signaling pathways as well as protection of FAK from caspase degradation that was reversed by an EGFR kinase inhibitor. Dual inhibition of FAK by FAK-CD and of EGFR by AG1478 cooperatively enhanced apoptosis in human breast cancer cell lines via inhibition of signaling that involved both tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family-dependent AKT and ERK1/2 pathways. This is the first report of the role of FAK and EGFR in apoptosis showing that simultaneous inhibition of FAK and EGFR can be critical in induction of apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines. BT474 breast carcinoma cells, described by Xu et al. (2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol.

The clone of the BT474 cell line used in this study had low expression of EGFR (Her-1) and Her-2. BT20 breast carcinoma cells, which overexpress EGFR (44Wang Z. Zhang L. Yeung T.K. Chen X. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1621-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell lines were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2humidified incubator. For EGF stimulation (Western blotting and immunoprecipitation), cells were serum-starved overnight in serum-free medium. In FAK-CD-induced apoptosis experiments, EGF was added three times at 0, 6, and 20 or 22 h of adenoviral infection. EGF (Calbiochem) was used at 10 ng/ml for 10 min for EGF-dependent signaling experiments. For inhibition of EGF stimulation, pretreatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 was done at 5 μm for 15 min. In FAK-CD-induced apoptosis experiments, BT474 cells were incubated with 5 μm AG1478 for 24 h, and BT20 cells were incubated with AG1478 for >72 h at 5 μm (added fresh every 24 h). Polyclonal antibodies to p125FAK (A17) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies were obtained from Promega. Anti-FAK monoclonal (4.47) and anti-ERK1/2 polyclonal antibodies were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-phospho-Ser AKT and anti-total AKT antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. Anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20, and anti-caspase-3 and anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-caspase-8 monoclonal antibody was from Pharmingen. Anti-phospho-Tyr397 FAK and anti-phospho-Tyr418 Src antibodies were from BIOSOURCE. Anti-vinculin, anti-α-tubulin, and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. Anti-hemagglutinin (HA) monoclonal antibody was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The tyrphostin AG1478, an inhibitor of EGFR autophosphorylation, was obtained from Calbiochem. PD98059, an inhibitor of ERK1/2, was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Caspase inhibitors were obtained fromCalbiochem. Recombinant adenoviruses carrying thelacZ gene (Ad-lacZ) and the HA-tagged FAK-CD gene, coding amino acids 693–1052 of FAK (Ad-FAK-CD) and the dominant-negative FADD protein (Ad-ΔFADD), were propagated by Dr. J. Samulski and the Gene Therapy Center Virus Vector Core Facility of the University of North Carolina and are described in Ref. 2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J.

Cells were plated at 1.5 × 106 in 100-mm culture plates and, after 24 h of attachment, infected with adenoviruses at the optimal concentration in 7 ml of medium with 10% serum. The optimal viral concentration was determined by infection of cells with different viral concentrations, and viral titer that produced >95% cell infectivity was used. The optimal viral titer was 500 focus-forming units/cell (obtained from the Gene Therapy Center Virus Vector Core Facility), which produced 99% cell infectivity and no toxic effects for Ad-lacZ transduction, checked by X-gal staining. The same viral titer was used for Ad-FAK-CD infection, causing >90% of cell infectivity, determined by HA immunostaining. For co-infection experiments, Ad-ΔFADD was used with FAK-CD at 333 viral particles/cell, which was shown to produce high levels of ΔFADD protein inside BT474 cells (2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A.

For BT20 cells, the cell-permeable caspase-3 inhibitor DEVD-CHO (Calbiochem) was added at 5 μm for 1 h before infection and was present during adenoviral incubation, added fresh every 24 h. The ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 was added at 10 μm for 15 min before adenoviral infection and was present during incubation with adenoviruses for 24 h. Under these conditions, PD98059 inhibited phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in Ad-FAK-CD-infected BT474-EGFR cells (data not shown). Cells were infected with Ad-lacZ as described above. Briefly, 24 h after infection, cells were fixed for 10 min on ice with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After washing twice with 1× PBS, cells were stained for 1–3 h with 1 μg/ml X-gal in X-gal buffer (5 mmK3Fe(CN)6, 5 mmK4Fe(CN)6, and 2 mmMgCl2 in 1× PBS). X-gal-positive (blue) cells were counted for determining of infection efficiency. To make a stable BT474 cell line expressing EGFR, cells were transfected with 10 μg of pcDNA3 plasmid alone to create BT474-pcDNA3 vector control cells or with 10 μg of EGFR-pcDNA3 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr. David Lee) to create BT474-EGFR cells. Transfections were accomplished with 20 μl of LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) in a 100-mm dish following the manufacturer's protocol. Stable BT474-EGFR and BT474-pcDNA3 clones were obtained using RPMI 1640 medium with the selective antibiotic Geneticin (500 μm; G418, Invitrogen). Expression of EGFR was checked by Western blotting with anti-EGFR antibody, and a clone with maximal EGFR expression was used for the study. Cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS and lysed on ice for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNaVO3, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Bio-Rad kit. The cleared lysates with equivalent amounts of protein were incubated with 5 μl of primary antibody for 1 h at 4 °C and with 25 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Oncogene Research Products Inc.). The precipitates were washed three times with the lysis buffer and resuspended in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer. For Western blotting, boiled samples were loaded on Ready SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). The phosphorylation status of the proteins examined was detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody RC20 in Tris-buffered saline/Tween buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. The blots were stripped in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, and 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol at 60 °C for 30 min and reprobed with primary antibody to check equal loading of proteins. Immunoblots were developed with Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Attached or detached suspended cells (collected by centrifugation and spread evenly on the slide) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. Cells were blocked with 25% normal goat serum in 1× PBS for 30 min, washed with 1× PBS, and incubated with primary antibody diluted 1:200 in 25% goat serum in 1× PBS. Cells were washed three times with 1× PBS, and a TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:400 dilution in 25% goat serum) was applied to the coverslip. After washing three times with 1× PBS, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-BodipyFL-phallacidin (1:25 dilution in 25% goat serum; Molecular Probes, Inc.) for actin staining. For co-immunostaining experiments, cells were incubated with another primary antibody diluted 1:100 in 25% goat serum in 1× PBS for 1 h. After washing three times with 1× PBS, a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:100 dilution) was applied to the coverslip. Detached cells were collected by centrifugation, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in 1× PBS for 10 min, and stained with Hoechst 33342 or spread evenly on a slide for TUNEL staining. In brief, Hoechst 33342 in 1× PBS solution (1 μg/ml) was added to the fixed cells for 10 min, and cells were washed twice with 1× PBS and spread evenly on the slide. TUNEL assay was done with an ApopTag fluorescein in situ apoptosis detection kit (Intergen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Simultaneous staining and quantification of apoptotic cells by TUNEL assay and Hoechst methods produced very similar results. The percent of apoptotic cells was calculated as the ratio of apoptotic cells to total number of cells in three independent experiments in several fields with a fluorescent microscope. To test the relationship between FAK and EGFR in breast cancer cell survival, we created a model system of EGFR overexpression in a clone of the BT474 breast carcinoma cell line (2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Craven R.J. Cance W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30597-30604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), a cell line that expresses high levels of p125FAK, but minimal levels of EGFR. Parental BT474 cells were stably transfected with the EGFR-pcDNA3 plasmid. These cells (called BT474-EGFR cells) expressed high levels of EGFR compared with the pcDNA3 vector control cells (called BT474-pcDNA3 cells) (Fig. 1 A). In the BT474-EGFR cells, treatment with EGF at 10 ng/ml rapidly increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, and this effect was inhibited in the presence of the tyrphostin AG1478, an EGFR kinase inhibitor (Fig. 1 B). The BT474-EGFR cells had a higher level of tyrosine-phosphorylated cellular proteins than the vector control cells (Fig. 1 C), and both BT474-pcDNA3 and BT474-EGFR cells rapidly increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 at 10 min upon EGF stimulation and reversed this effect upon AG1478 treatment (Fig. 1 D). In addition, AKT (Ser473) and FAK (phospho-Tyr397 and phospho-Tyr577) (data not shown) were highly phosphorylated in the BT474-EGFR cells. To test whether FAK and EGFR were associated in the BT474-EGFR cells, EGFR and FAK were immunoprecipitated using anti-FAK monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 A, left panels). In these experiments, anti-FAK antibodies precipitated EGFR that was tyrosine-phosphorylated in the presence of EGF (Fig.2 A, upper left panel). Immunoprecipitation with anti-EGFR antibodies also precipitated FAK (Fig. 2 A,right panels). The FAK and EGFR association was constitutive, as detected in the presence and absence of EGF (Fig.2 A). Thus, FAK and EGFR are physically associated in these breast cancer cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular FAK was not affected by the EGFR inhibitor AG1478 (Fig. 2 A,left panels), although a small portion of phosphorylated FAK that was associated with EGFR was inhibited by AG1478 (upper right panel). Dual immunofluorescence assays in individual cells demonstrated that FAK and EGFR were co-localized at focal adhesions in the BT474-EGFR cells (Fig. 2 B, left panels) and also in the BT20 cells, which endogenously overexpress EGFR (right panels). These results show that FAK and EGFR associate and co-localize at the focal adhesions of these breast cancer cells. Next, we tested whether overexpression of EGFR protects breast cancer cells from detachment and apoptosis induced by FAK inhibition. In these experiments, we down-regulated FAK function using Ad-FAK-CD in the BT474-EGFR and BT474-pcDNA3 vector control cells. To inhibit FAK, we used an adenoviral construct of the C-terminal domain (Ad-FAK-CD) that has been shown to act as a dominant-negative for FAK function (2Xu L.-H. Yang X. Bradham C.A. Brenner D.A.

In these experiments, we used Ad-lacZ as a control at an equal multiplicity of infection. These conditions resulted in >95% infectivity as assessed by X-gal staining for Ad-lacZ (Fig.3 A) and by HA immunostaining for HA epitope-tagged Ad-FAK-CD (Fig. 3 B). After 24 h of FAK-CD expression, there were similar levels of loss of adhesion in the vector control cells (93 ± 6%) and in the EGFR-overexpressing cells (83 ± 17%) (Fig.4 A) and only 0.5% detachment by control Ad-lacZ at the same dose (data not shown). Furthermore, inhibition of EGFR kinase activity with AG1478 did not enhance the loss of adhesion (Fig. 4 A). These results show that overexpression of EGFR does not augment the ability of BT474 cells to resist loss of adhesion induced by inhibition of FAK function. In contrast, EGFR suppressed apoptosis induced by FAK inhibition with Ad-FAK-CD. After 24 h of Ad-FAK-CD infection, detached BT474-EGFR cells had significantly reduced levels of apoptosis (66%) compared with the BT474-pcDNA3 cells (97%) (Fig. 4 B). Treatment of the BT474-EGFR cells with EGF (10 ng/ml) did not enhance this resistance to apoptosis, indicating that the maximal effect was already obtained by the background autophosphorylation and signaling caused by EGFR overexpression. However, inhibition of EGFR signaling with AG1478 in the BT474-EGFR cells increased the level of apo"

Here we investigated the role of GSK3β signaling in vascular biology by examining its function in endothelial cells (ECs). In EC, the regulatory phosphorylation of GSK3β was found to be under the control of phosphoinositide 3-kinase-, MAPK-, and protein kinase A-dependent signaling pathways. The transduction of a nonphosphorylatable constitutively active mutant of GSKβ promoted apoptosis under the conditions of prolonged serum deprivation or the disruption of cell-matrix attachments. Conversely, the transduction of catalytically inactive GSK3β promoted EC survival under the conditions of cellular stress. Under normal cell culture conditions, the activation of GSK3β signaling inhibited the migration of EC to vascular endothelial growth factor or basic fibroblast growth factor. Angiogenesis was inhibited by GSK3β activation in an in vivo Matrigel plug assay, whereas the inhibition of GSK3β signaling enhanced capillary formation. These data suggest that GSK3β functions at the nodal point of converging signaling pathways in EC to regulate vessel growth through its control of vascular cell migration and survival.

Fraser E.F. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). GSK3α and GSK3β are encoded by different genes, and they are 85% homologous in their amino acid sequence. Both isoforms have similar substrate specificity and are regulated in parallel in response to growth factor stimulation (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). However, the disruption of the GSK3β gene in mice results in embryonic lethality, indicating that GSK3α cannot completely substitute for a loss of GSK3β (3Hoeflich K.P. Luo J. Rubie E.A. Tsao M.S. Jin O. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 2000; 406: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Although GSK3 was originally identified as a kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase, subsequent studies have demonstrated that it has a broader range of substrates including β-catenin, tau, myelin basic protein, cyclin D1, GATA4, c-Jun, c-Myc, CREB, initiation factor eIF2B, heat shock factor-1, and p53 (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Through the phosphorylation of this diverse set of substrates, GSK3 regulates embryonic development and proliferative responses in adult tissues and is implicated in several human disease states including tumorigenesis, Alzheimer's disease, and diabetes. GSK3 signaling is inactivated in cells that are stimulated by mitogens. Growth factor-induced inactivation involves phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine residue (Ser-21 for GSK3α and Ser-9 for GSK3β). This phosphorylation can be mediated by several upstream protein kinases including p90RSK, p70S6K, integrin-linked kinase, Akt, and protein kinase A (PKA) (4Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). GSK3 is also regulated by Wnt signaling during embryonic development, leading to the specification of cell fate (5Ruel L. Stambolic V. Ali A. Manoukian A.S. Woodgett J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21790-21796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mitogenic and Wnt signaling differentially regulates GSK, and this can elicit distinct downstream responses (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the role of GSK3 signaling in the cardiovascular system. Recently, two studies have shown that GSK3β signaling inhibits cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, an effect that may be mediated through its regulation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells or GATA4 transcription factors (6Haq S. Choukroun G. Kang Z.B. Ranu H. Matsui T. Rosenzweig A. Molkentin J.D. Alessandrini A. Woodgett J. Hajjar R. Michael A. Force T. J.

It has also been shown that GSK3β promotes apoptosis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (8Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, its function in endothelial cells (ECs) and its role in blood vessel formation have not been examined. In this study, we examined the upstream signaling pathways that control GSK3β phosphorylation and inactivation in ECs. To determine the functional significance of this signaling pathway, GSK3 activity was modulated using adenoviral vectors expressing mutant GSK3 proteins, and the effects on survival, migration, NO production, and angiogenesis were assessed. LY294002 was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (St. Louis, MO). PD98059, bisindolylmaleimide 1, H-89, 8-bromo-3,5-cyclic AMP, forskolin, and 3-isobutyl-1-methyxanthine were purchased from Calbiochem. Recombinant human VEGF-165, basic FGF-157, and PDGF-BB were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). HUVECs were cultured in endothelial growth medium (Clonetics). 4–6 passage cells were used in this study. To examine the regulation of GSK3β phosphorylation, HUVECs were serum-starved for 15 h, treated with the indicated agents for 1 h, and stimulated with 10% fetal bovine serum. To examine the role of Akt in the regulation of GSK3β phosphorylation, HUVECs were transfected with a replication-defective adenovirus expressing myristoylated Akt1, dominant-negative Akt1, or β-galactosidase (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 10Witzenbichler B. Kureishi Y. Luo Z., Le Roux A. Branellec D. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To examine serum deprivation-induced apoptosis, HUVECs were transduced with the indicated adenoviral construct and cultured in serum-free media for 1–4 days. Some assays employed a replication-defective adenoviral vector expressing catalytically inactive GSK3β (GSK3β-KM) where lysine residues at positions 85 and 86 were mutated to methionine and alanine, respectively. Another vector expressed the nonphosphorylatable constitutively active mutant of GSK3β (GSK3β-S9A) where the serine residue at position 9 was mutated to alanine (11Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I.

Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the effect of GSK3β signaling on anoikis, HUVECs were trypsinized and seeded on the poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)-coated dishes in the EGM. Poly-HEMA solution (10 mg/ml) (Sigma), an attachment inhibitor, was dispensed to cover the entire surface of a 10-cm dish or each well of a 6-well plate and completely dried in a culture hood. This process was repeated twice, and then the treated surface was extensively washed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before use for suspension cultures. At serial time points after suspension, HUVECs were harvested for immunoblot or viability assays or were transferred to adhesive Falcon cell culture plates (Becton Dickinson) and cultured in EGM to evaluate the reattachment and growth of the anchorage-deprived cells. Immunoblot assays were performed by modification of the procedures described previously (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). HUVECs were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% SDS, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. One tablet of protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) per 10 ml of lysis buffer, vanadate, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added just prior to use. Protein concentration was determined with a protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein (20 μg) was separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked with T-PBS (1× PBS, 0.3% Tween 20) containing 3% dry milk and incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with T-PBS, the membrane was reblocked and incubated with secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. ECL or ECL Plus (Amersham Biosciences) was used for detection. To reprobe the membrane, it was treated with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce). The primary antibodies used were anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser-9) antibody (1:750 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-phospho-Akt (Ser-473) antibody (1:250 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), anti-total GSK3β antibody (1:1000 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-phospho-(Ser-33/Ser-37/Thr-41) β-catenin (1:500 dilution, Cell Signaling Technology), and anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:4000 dilution, Oncogene). The secondary antibodies were anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate or anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2500 dilution, Promega). Immunoblots were quantified by densitometry using TINA 2.10e software (Raytest Isotopenmessgeraete GmbH, Straubehardt, Germany). Migration assays were performed by a modification of the procedure described previously using a Boyden chamber (Neuroprobe) (10Witzenbichler B. Kureishi Y. Luo Z., Le Roux A. Branellec D. Walsh K. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 1469-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). HUVECs were infected with adenovirus vectors overnight in EGM and then serum-starved for 5 h in endothelial basal medium (Clonetics) and trypsinized. Cells were resuspended in endothelial basal medium as 100,000 cells/300 μl and were added on the upper chamber. VEGF (50 ng/ml) or basic FGF (25 ng/ml) in EBM was added into the lower chamber. For migration assays of human aortic smooth muscle cells (HAoSMC), PDGF (50 ng/ml) or basic FGF (50 ng/ml) was used. Polycarbonate filters (8-μm pores, Neuroprobe) precoated with gelatin by overnight incubation in 0.5% gelatin solution were set between lower and upper chambers. The chamber was incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. The filter was carefully removed, and cells attached on the upper side were wiped off. HUVECs migrating through the filter and appearing on the lower side were fixed by careful immersion of the filter into 70% ethanol for 15 min, stained with Giemsa solution, and counted in three random fields per well. Each experiment was performed in duplicate, and four separate experiments were performed in each group. Cell viability was assessed by WST-1 assay, flow cytometry analysis of hypodiploid DNA, observations of pyknotic nuclei, and annexin V/propidium iodide double staining by modification of procedures described previously (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, 11Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). HUVECs in 96-well plates were infected with adenovirus and analyzed using tetrazolium salt WST-1 as instructed by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA fragmentation was assessed by flow cytometry. For these assays, HUVECs were infected with adenoviruses and serum-starved for 2–4 days. At several time points after serum starvation, the attached and floating HUVECs were harvested and fixed in cold 90% ethanol for 20 min and then resuspended in staining buffer consisting of 1 mg/ml RNaseA, 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, and 0.01% Nonidet P-40. DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry on the FL-2 channel, and gating was set to exclude debris and cellular aggregates. For each analysis, 10,000 events were counted. Alternatively, pyknotic nuclei were assessed by Hoechst staining. For these assays, HUVECs were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, carefully washed with PBS twice, and stained with 10 mg/ml solution of Hoechst 33342 (Sigma) at room temperature with light shielded. Cell viability was also assessed by annexin V/propidium iodide double staining. For these experiments, serum-deprived HUVECs were cultured in 4-well slide chambers (Nunc). The medium was removed, and cells were covered with staining solution that contains annexin V-fluorescein, propidium iodide, and binding buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 15 min at room temperature. To examine the anchorage deprivation-induced apoptosis, HUVECs in suspension culture were centrifuged at 200 × g for 5 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in staining solution, incubated for 15 min at room temperature, and spread on glass slides. The formation of new vesselsin vivo was evaluated by Matrigel plug assay (Becton Dickinson) by a modification of the procedures described previously (12Passaniti A. Taylor R.M. Pili R. Guo Y. Long P.V. Haney J.A. Pauly R.R. Grant D.S. Martin G.R. Lab. Invest. 1992; 67: 519-528PubMed Google Scholar). For these experiments, equal amounts of heparin (10 units/ml) and basic FGF (1 μg/ml) (R&D) were mixed, and 5 ml of this solution was mixed on ice with 10 ml of Matrigel such that the final concentration of basic FGF was 250 ng/ml. Solutions of adenoviral vectors encoding β-galactosidase, GSK3β-KM, or GSK3β-S9A were mixed in with Matrigel solution on ice (2×108 plaque forming units of virus/500 μl). 500 μl of Matrigel containing growth factor and adenovirus was injected subcutaneously near the right mid-abdomen of C57BL mice (Jackson Laboratories). Mice were sacrificed 10 days after the injection. The Matrigel plugs with the adjacent subcutaneous tissues were carefully recovered by en bloc resection, embedded in OCT compound, and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Immunohistochemistry for hemagglutinin (HA) or CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) and histochemistry for alkaline phosphatase were performed on adjacent frozen sections. The primary antibodies were anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:20 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 goat polyclonal antibody (1:20 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies were biotinylated horse anti-goat IgG antibody (1:100 dilution, Vector Laboratories) and biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:100 dilution, Vector Laboratories). Other components for immunohistochemistry were from the LSAB-2 kit (Dako). NO mediates many of its biological effects by activating soluble guanylyl cyclase, resulting in increased intracellular cGMP concentration. Therefore, eNOS-derived NO production was monitored in intact cells by measuring the accumulation of cGMP sensitive to the eNOS inhibitor L-NAME by modification of the procedures previously described (13Thomas S.R. Chen K. Keaney J.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6017-6024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). HUVEC cultured in 6-well plates were incubated for 60 min in HEPES-buffered physiologic salt solution (22 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 0.16 mm HPO4, 0.4 mmH2PO4, 5 mm NaHCO3, 5.6 mmd-glucose) supplemented with 200 μm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and 200 μml-Arg in the absence or presence of L-NAME (500 μm). HUVECs were lysed by the addition of 6% ice-cold trichloroacetic acid. The level of cGMP present in the cell lysates was determined by enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman). Data are shown as the mean ± S.E. All data were evaluated with a two-tailed paired Student'st test or compared by one-way ANOVA, Student-Newman-Keuls post-hoc test. We first assayed for the presence of GSK3β in ECs and examined the signal transduction pathways that are involved in its regulatory phosphorylation at serine 9. Stimulation with fetal bovine serum (FBS) was used as a general EC activator because it contains many growth factors and cytokines and promotes signaling through multiple pathways. The stimulation of serum-deprived HUVECs with 10% FBS for 1 h led to a marked increase in GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig.1 A). The phosphorylation of serine 9 results in autoinhibition of GSK3β because the phosphorylated N terminus binds to the active site as a competitive pseudosubstrate (1Dajani R. Fraser E.F. Roe S.M. Young N. Good V. Dale T.C. Pearl L.H. Cell. 2001; 105: 721-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of GSK3β was paralleled by an increase in the phosphorylation of Akt, a candidate upstream kinase that is regulated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (4Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). The serum-induced phosphorylation of GSK3β was inhibited by pretreatment with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or the MAPK inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, Akt phosphorylation was blocked by LY294002, but the administration of PD98059 significantly elevated the level of Akt phosphorylation. These treatments did not detectably alter the total level of Akt (data not shown) or GSK3β (Fig. 1) protein expression. The transduction of ECs with a replication-defective adenovirus construct expressing a dominant-negative form of Akt1 inhibited the serum-stimulated phosphorylation of GSK3β (Fig. 1 B). Conversely, transduction with a vector expressing a constitutively active form of Akt1 promoted GSK3β phosphorylation in the absence of serum (Fig. 1 C). These data are consistent with pharmacological data showing that LY294002 blocks serum-induced GSK3β phosphorylation (Fig. 1 A), and collectively, they suggest that the PI3K/Akt signaling axis is a mediator of GSK3β phosphorylation in response to mitogen activation. PKA-mediated regulation of GSK3β in HUVECs was indicated by the ability of the PKA activators 8-bromo-cyclic AMP or forskolin to induce the phosphorylation of GSK3β in serum-deprived cells (Fig.1 D). This induction was blocked by pretreatment with the PKA inhibitor H89. In contrast to GSK3β regulation, the exposure of cells to H89 promoted the phosphorylation of Akt, consistent with previous data (14Boo Y.C. Sorescu G. Boyd N. Shiojima I. Walsh K., Du, J. Jo H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3388-3396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data show that although PI3K signaling participates in GSK3β regulation, Akt and GSK3β phosphorylations are differentially regulated by MAPK and PKA signaling pathways. To modulate the intracellular GSK3β activity in ECs, replication-defective adenoviral vectors that express either a nonphosphorylatable constitutively active mutant (GSK3β-S9A) or a catalytically inactive mutant (GSK3β-KM), which functions as a dominant-negative form (15Eldar-Finkelman H.

Pessin J.E. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17934-17940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), were employed. As shown in Fig.1 E, HUVECs transduced with GSK3β-S9A showed a decline in phosphorylated GSK3β, indicative of an activation of GSK3β signaling. An activation of GSK3β signaling was also indicated by a marked increase in the phosphorylation of the downstream substrate β-catenin. In contrast, transduction with GSK3β-KM led to an increase in GSK3β protein that was phosphorylated at serine 9. When HUVECs were transduced with GSK3β-S9A (50 m.o.i.), their chemotactic activities toward VEGF or bFGF were significantly decreased (Fig.2 A). Under the conditions of these assays, VEGF was a more potent chemoattractant than bFGF. The transduction of GSK3β-KM slightly enhanced the directional migration of HUVECs toward VEGF or bFGF, but this was not statistically significant. The antimigratory effect of GSK3β-S9A was not due to a cytotoxic effect of this vector, because adeno-GSK3β-S9A did not decrease viability as assessed by a WST-1 assay under these cell culture conditions (relative values: β-galactosidase, 100 ± 6%; GSK3-KM, 104 ± 8%; GSK-S9A, 98 ± 6%). Furthermore, quantitative analysis of pyknotic nuclei did not reveal any increase or decrease in cell death by adenovirus-mediated GSK3β transduction under these conditions (data not shown). However, at later time points of serum deprivation (>2 days), the modulation of GSK3β signaling influenced cellular survival (see below). Because the role of GSK3β on the migration of vascular cells had not been described previously, the effects of GSK3β-S9A and GSK3β-KM on the migration of HAoSMC toward bFGF or PDGF were also assayed. The transduction of GSK3β-S9A significantly inhibited the chemotactic activities of HAoSMC toward PDGF or bFGF in the Boyden chamber analysis (Fig. 2 B). Conversely, the transduction of GSK3β-KM significantly enhanced the chemotaxis of HAoSMC toward either growth factor. Under these experimental conditions, GSK3β-S9A or GSK3β-KM did not show a significant cytotoxic or cytoprotective effect, respectively, as assessed by WST-1 assay (relative values: β-galactosidase, 100 ± 7%; GSK3-KM, 101 ± 7%; GSK-S9A, 96 ± 5%) or by visual examination of cells for apoptotic morphology (data not shown). As shown above, the transduction of GSK3β-S9A or GSK3β-KM had no effect on cell viability under normal cell culture conditions with mitogens present in the media or after short periods of serum deprivation. Therefore, to examine the role of GSK3β signaling in EC viability, HUVECs were infected with the adenoviral vectors expressing GSK3β mutants and incubated in serum-free media for 2–4 days to promote apoptosis (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). Under these culture conditions, the transduction of GSK3β-KM significantly reduced the subdiploid fraction of DNA detected by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis, whereas the constitutively active GSK3β-S9A increased DNA degradation (Fig.3 A). These data were corroborated by assessing the impact of GSK3β signaling modulation on the frequency of pyknotic nuclei in Hoechst 33342-stained HUVEC cultures (Fig. 3 B). Consistent with these data, the transduction of GSK3β-KM significantly promoted viability as assessed by the WST-1 assay of mitochondrial function, whereas GSK3β-S9A reduced mitochondrial function at these late timepoints (Fig.3 C). Adhesion to extracellular matrix is an important determinant of EC survival under conditions of neovascularization (17Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; : 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of GSK3β signaling in HUVEC anoikis was assessed. As shown in Fig.4 A, there was a time-dependent decrease in phosphorylated GSK3β following the placement of HUVEC in suspension culture. The decrease in GSK3β phosphorylation was paralleled by decreases in the phosphorylation and protein level of Akt, a regulator of EC anoikis (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). To assess the role of GSK3β signaling in EC anoikis, HUVECs were transduced with GSK3β-KM or GSK3β-S9A prior to placement in suspension cultures. Annexin V staining revealed that the expression of GSK3β-KM protected HUVECs from anoikis compared with control HUVECs that were transduced with β-galactosidase (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, GSK-S9A promoted cell death under these conditions. These findings were confirmed by a reattachment assay where HUVECs were reseeded on the adhesive plate after 1 day of the suspension culture (Fig. 4,C and D). Cells expressing GSK-KM displayed a higher frequency of successful reattachment than control cells, whereas HUVEC transduced with GSK-S9A displayed a lower frequency of reattachment following incubation in suspension culture. A Matrigel plug assay in mice was employed to test the role of GSK3β signaling in angiogenesisin vivo. Adenoviral vectors (2 × 108plaque-forming units) were incorporated in the Matrigel plugs along with bFGF (250 ng/ml) prior to subcutaneous implantation in the abdomen of C57BL6 mice for 10 days prior to recovery. In this assay, the Matrigel serves as a reservoir for the viral vector, and ECs that infiltrate the plug become transduced and express the transgene. The expression of the HA-tagged GSK3β transgene products was shown by immunohistochemistry (Fig.5 A). HA-positive immunostaining was detectable in plugs formulated with adenoviral vectors encoding GSK-KM and GSK-S9A, but little or no signal was detected in plugs formulated with the β-galactosidase-expressing adenovirus. EC infiltration of these plugs was assessed by immunohistochemical analysis of CD31-positive cells. Plugs formulated with adeno-GSK3β-KM exhibited significantly higher densities of ECs than control plugs (Fig. 5, A and B). Conversely, plugs formulated with GSK3β-S9A displayed a lower density of CD31-positive cells than controls. These data were corroborated by analyzing the densities of alkaline phosphatase-positive capillaries within these plugs (Fig. 5, A and B). Previous studies suggest that Akt activation can promote an angiogenic phenotype in ECs in part via its ability to promote NO production (11Kureishi Y. Luo Z. Shiojima I. Bialik A. Fulton D. Lefer D.J. Sessa W.C. Walsh K. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar, 18Morales-Ruiz M. Fulton G. Sowa G. Languino L.R. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 892-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Therefore, the effects of GSK3β-mediated signaling on NO output in HUVEC were investigated. For this we measured the increase in intracellular levels of cGMP that is inhibitable by the NOS inhibitor L-NAME, an assay for endothelial cell-derived NO output (19Huang A. Vita J.A. Venema R.C. Keaney J.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17399-17406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). TableI shows that the expression of constitutively active Akt (Myr-Akt) increased NO output by endothelial cells, consistent with previous studies (20Fulton D. Gratton J.-P. McCabe T.J. Fontana J. Fujio Y. Walsh K. Franke T.F. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W.C. Nature. 1999; 399: 597-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar, 21Luo, Z., Fujio, Y., Kureishi, Y., Rudic, R. D., Daumerie, G., Fulton, D., Sessa, W. C., and Walsh, K. (2000) 106,493–499.Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of either GSK3β-KM or GSK3β-S9A did not result in an increase in NO output. These treatments also did not detectably alter the level of eNOS protein expression (data not shown). Taken together, these results are consistent with the notion that changes in NO production are not required for GSK3β-mediated effects on migration, survival, or angiogenesis.Table IEffects of GSK3β-mediated signaling on NO production in HUVECTreatmentcGMPpmol/mg cell proteinGFP1.7 ± 0.2Myr-Akt11.3 ± 6.5*GSK3β-S9A1.6 ± 0.2GSK3β-KM1.7 ± 0.2l-NAME1.4 ± 0.2HUVECs were infected for 18–24 h with Ad-GFP, Ad-MyrAkt, Ad-GSK3β-S9A, and Ad-GSK3β-KM.

This study examined the regulation and function of GSK3β in EC biology and blood vessel growth. Protein kinase inhibitors were used to assess the signaling pathways that regulate GSK3β in ECs. The inhibitory effect of LY294002 on GSK3β phosphorylation suggests that PI3K-dependent pathways are a regulator of its activity in response to mitogen stimulation, and these data are consistent with the finding that GSK3β is directly phosphorylated by the PI3K-regulated protein kinase Akt (4Cohen P. Frame S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 769-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported further by the finding that serum-stimulated GSK3β phosphorylation is inhibited by transduction of dominant-negative Akt, whereas the transduction of constitutively active Akt is sufficient to promote GSK3β phosphorylation in the absence of mitogen stimulation. Our studies also revealed that GSK3β is regulated independent of PI3K/Akt signaling. For example, MAPK inhibition down-regulates GSK3β phosphorylation, whereas it has the opposite effect on Akt phosphorylation. Furthermore, PKA agonists were found to increase GSK3β phosphorylation, whereas PKA inhibition promoted the phosphorylation of Akt. Collectively, these data suggest that GSK3β is downstream from many signaling pathways in ECs (Fig. 6), suggesting that its activity may be regulated by a variety of angiogenic growth factors and cytokines. EC survival is an important factor influencing angiogenesis and vessel integrity, and angiogenic growth factor withdrawal will lead to vessel regression in tumors (22Benjamin L.E. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This study shows that GSK3β plays a key role in controlling EC survival in response to growth factor limitation. The activation of GSK3β signaling increased EC apoptosis in response to growth factor deprivation as shown by increased DNA fragmentation and decreased mitochondrial function. Conversely, the ablation of GSK3β signaling protected cells from apoptosis under conditions of mitogen deprivation. Although the modulation of GSK3β has been shown to influence apoptosis in response to mitogen deprivation in other cell types (8Hall J.L. Chatham J.C. Eldar-Finkelman H. Gibbons G.H. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 1171-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Li M. Wang X. Meintzer M.K. Laessig T. Birnbaum M.J. Heidenreich K.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9356-9363Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), the data reported here are the first to show that GSK3β signaling can regulate cell death that results from the disruption of cell-matrix interactions (i.e. anoikis). When ECs were deprived of anchorage attachments, there were time-dependent decreases in the levels of phosphorylated GSK3β. Apoptosis under these conditions was markedly reduced by the expression of catalytically inactive GSK3β and increased by constitutively active GSK3β, demonstrating that GSK3β signaling is a critical modulator of EC anoikis. With regard to angiogenesis, the control of anoikis is critical because proper associations between cells and matrix are essential for neovascularization because they promote EC survival as they migrate toward the angiogenic source (17Brooks P.C. Montgomery A.M.P. Rosenfeld M. Reisfeld R.A. Hu T. Klier G. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1994; : 1157-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2170) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that the pro-survival signals from cell surface-extracellular matrix interactions can be mediated by Akt (9Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) and by integrin-linked kinase (24Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates both Akt and GSK3β (25Troussard A.A. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This study also revealed that GSK3β signaling controls EC migration toward VEGF or bFGF and controls smooth muscle cell migration toward PDGF or bFGF. These effects on migration were not the result of cytotoxic or cytoprotective actions of the different GSK3β vectors because these assays were performed for short periods (5 h) in the presence of a chemoattractant, whereas significant apoptosis did not occur unless cells were deprived of serum for 2 or more days. Because migration of ECs is an essential component of the angiogenic response, a mouse angiogenesis assay was employed to assess the consequences of adenovirus-mediated GSK3β gene transfer on capillary formation in Matrigel plugs containing bFGF. Unlike other angiogenesis models, the Matrigel plug assay can be adapted to study the consequences of adenovirus-gene transfer on vessel growth because the Matrigel serves as a reservoir for the viral vector, leading to high efficiency transduction of ECs as they infiltrate the plug. In these experiments, the kinase mutant GSK3β increased capillary density in the plug, whereas constitutively active GSK3β markedly reduced capillary formation. These data show that GSK3β signaling functions in ECs negatively regulate angiogenesis, and they are consistent with the inhibitory effects of GSK3β signaling on EC migration and survival in vitro. Previous studies have shown that the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway is a key regulator of the angiogenic phenotype in ECs (26Shiojima I. Walsh K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1243-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). The results of this study extend our knowledge of the signaling pathways that regulate angiogenesis by documenting that phosphorylation of GSK3β, one of many substrates for Akt, is essential for EC survival and migrationin vitro and angiogenesis in vivo. Of note, GSK3β-mediated regulation of the angiogenic phenotype was not associated with changes in NO production, suggesting that GSK3β signaling can regulate vessel growth independent from the Akt-eNOS regulatory axis. It is also shown that MAPK- and PKA-dependent signaling pathways promote changes in GSK3β phosphorylation that favor angiogenesis. These observations are significant because some angiogenic factors such as bFGF are efficient activators of MAPK but do not activate PI3K/Akt signaling (data not shown). GSK3β phosphorylation is also controlled by Wnt through a mechanism that differs from that employed by mitogenic factors (2Frame S. Cohen P. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), and recent studies have shown that Wnt signaling can regulate EC growth (27Duplaa C. Jaspard B. Moreau C. D'Amore P.A. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1433-1445Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that GSK3β functions at a convergence of multiple signaling pathways to coordinate EC responses to different angiogenic inputs (Fig. 6) and that it can modulate the angiogenic phenotype of ECs in an eNOS-independent manner."

Recent biochemical, cell biological, and genetic studies have implicated integrin-linked kinase (ILK) as a key component of the cell-ECM adhesion structures (9Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4485-4489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wu C. Dedhar S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Structurally, ILK comprises an N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain, a pleckstrin homology-like motif, and a C-terminal kinase domain that exhibits significant homology to other protein kinase catalytic domains. One of the major functions of ILK is to mediate multiple protein-protein interactions at cell-ECM adhesion sites. In previous studies, we have found that ILK binds to PINCH-1 (12Tu Y., Li, F. Goicoechea S. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2425-2434Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), a widely expressed focal adhesion protein consisting of five LIM domains. The ILK-PINCH-1 interaction is mediated by the N-terminal ANK domain of ILK and the second zinc finger of the N-terminal-most LIM domain (LIM1) of PINCH-1 (13Li F. Zhang Y. Wu C. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4589-4599Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to interacting with PINCH-1, ILK is capable of interacting with several other focal adhesion proteins including β1 integrins (14Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L.

Recently, we have shown that ILK binds to both PINCH-1 and CH-ILKBP simultaneously, resulting in the formation of a PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex in mammalian cells (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Recent biochemical, cell biological, and genetic studies have provided strong evidence for an important role of the PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex in integrin-mediated cell-ECM interactions (9Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 319-323Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 10Wu C. J.

For example, inhibition of the PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex formation in mammalian cells by overexpression of dominant negative PINCH-1 or ILK mutants significantly impaired cell shape change and migration (21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In genetic model systems such as Caenorhabditis elegans, mutations in pinch-1/unc-97 (22Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar),ilk/pat-4 (23Mackinnon A.C. Qadota H. Norman K.R. Moerman D.G. Williams B.D. Curr.

Cell (Suppl.). 2000; 11: 515aGoogle Scholar) all resulted in a Pat phenotype similar to that of β-integrin/pat-3 or α-integrin/pat-2, which is characterized by defects in dense body and M-line (similar to cell-ECM adhesion sites in mammalian cells) assembly (24Williams B.D. Waterston R.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 475-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 25Gettner S.N. Kenyon C. Reichardt L.F. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1127-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). While it is increasingly clear that the PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex plays an important role in the coupling of the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton, how cells regulate the assembly and functions of the PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex was not known. Search of the genomic sequence of C. elegans has revealed that there exists a gene (termed pin-2) encoding a protein that is structurally related to PINCH-1/UNC-97 (22Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). A partial sequence of a putative PINCH-1-related human protein (termed as PINCH-2) has been predicted based on cDNA sequence analyses of human EST clones (22Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). It was not known, however, whether PINCH-2 is co-expressed with PINCH-1 in human cells. Furthermore, neither the molecular activities nor the cellular functions of PINCH-2 were known. In this study, we have cloned and characterized PINCH-2. Our results show that PINCH-2 localizes to both cell-ECM adhesion sites and the nucleus and provide strong evidence for an important role of PINCH-2 in the regulation of the PINCH-1·ILK·CH-ILKBP complex formation, cell shape change, and migration. Human embryonal kidney 293 cells, human rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cells, and mouse C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REF-52) were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary human mesangial cells were from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultured in MsGMTM BulletKit medium (Clonetics).

Rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibodies, mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies (M2 and M5), and M2-conjugated agarose beads were from Clontech and Sigma, respectively. Rhodamine RedTM- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (minimal cross-reaction with human, bovine, rabbit, and swine serum proteins), Rhodamine RedTM- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (minimal cross-reaction with human, mouse, and rat serum proteins), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Medium for cell culture was from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY) or Mediatech/CellgroR (Herndon, VA). The full-length PINCH-2 cDNA was cloned from human RD cells by reverse transcription-PCR. Poly(A)+RNA was isolated from the RD cells using Oligotex mRNA kits (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR was carried out using First-Strand cDNA synthesis kits (Amersham Biosciences) with PINCH-2 primers (5′-ATAGATCTGATGACGGGAAGCAATATGTCGGACGCC-3′ and 5′-ACTGTCGACTCAGGCAGAGTTGAGGTCTGTGGCCTT-3′) and PINCH-1 primers (5′-GCACTAGTGAATTCATGGCCAACGCCCTGGCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTGTCGACTTAAGTCTTTTCTTCAGCTCC-3′), respectively. The sequences of the PCR products were determined by automated DNA sequencing. To test the specificities of the PINCH-2 and PINCH-1 primers, we carried out PCR using reaction mixtures containing: 1) the PINCH-2 primers + PINCH-2 cDNA; 2) the PINCH-2 primers + PINCH-1 cDNA; 3) the PINCH-2 primers + an irrelevant cDNA; 4) the PINCH-1 primers + PINCH-1 cDNA; 5) the PINCH-1 primers + PINCH-2 cDNA; and 6) the PINCH-1 primers + an irrelevant cDNA. No PCR products were synthesized in any of the reactions containing mismatched PCR primers and templates (see “Results”). DNA fragments encoding the full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2 (as specified in each experiment) were generated by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/SalI sites of the pFLAG-CMV-2 vector (Sigma). DNA fragments encoding the FLAG-tagged full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2 were cloned into the pEGFP-C2 expression vector (Clontech). To express the full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2 in mammalian cells, cells were transfected with the FLAG or GFP expression vectors encoding the full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2 using LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) as described (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The expression of the FLAG- and/or GFP-tagged full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2 in the transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-FLAG and anti-GFP antibodies. The adenoviral expression vector encoding FLAG-tagged full-length human PINCH-2 was generated following a previously described protocol (21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, human PINCH-2 cDNA was cloned into theSalI/XbaI sites of the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector. The shuttle vector plasmid was linearized with PmeI, purified, and mixed with supercoiled pADEsay-1. The vectors were transferred into Escherichia coli BJ5183 by electroporation. The bacteria were placed in 1 ml of LB broth, Lennox (Fisher) at 37 °C for 1 h. The bacteria were then inoculated onto agar containing LB broth supplemented with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. After 16–20 h growth, colonies were picked and grown in 2 ml of LB broth containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. Clones were screened by digestions with restriction endonucleases PacI and BamHI. The positive plasmids were transformed into DH10B cells by electroporation for large-scale amplification. The plasmid DNA was digested with PacI, ethanol-precipitated, and was used to transfect 293 cells with LipofectAMINE PLUS. The transfected cells were harvested 10 days after transfection. The cells were lysed by three cycles of freezing in a methanol/dry ice bath and rapid thawing at 37 °C, and the lysates containing the recombinant adenovirus were collected. The control adenoviral expression vector encoding β-galactosidase was kindly provided by Drs. Tong-Chuan He and Bert Vogelstein (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Johns Hopkins Oncology Center, Baltimore, MD). The recombinant adenoviral expressing vectors were used to infect REF-52 cells. The infection efficiency was monitored by the expression of GFP encoded by the viral vectors and typically reached 80–90% within 48 h. The expression of the FLAG-PINCH-2 in the infected cells was confirmed by Western blotting with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody M5. Polyclonal anti-PINCH-2 antisera were generated by immunizing rabbits with a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide containing PINCH-2 sequence AQPKATDLNSA. To purify anti-PINCH-2 antibodies, rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antisera were passed through an affinity column containing agarose beads coupled with the PINCH-2 peptide (1 mg of peptide/ml of beads). After collecting the flow-through fractions, the column was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-PINCH-2 antibodies were eluted from the affinity column with 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 2.9) and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated in complete medium on fibronectin-coated coverslips or Lab-Tek 8-chamber culture slides and incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere for at least 6 h. The cells were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and stained with affinity purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies and/or mouse monoclonal antibodies as specified in each experiment. The primary antibodies were detected with secondary Rhodamine RedTM-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibodies, respectively. In some experiments, cells were dually stained with affinity purified rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies and tetramethylrhodamine-labeled phalloidin (to visualize the actin cytoskeleton). The rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies were detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies in these experiments. Cells (as specified in each experiment) were cultured in complete medium in 60- or 100-mm culture plates. Cell monolayers were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and directly lysed on the plates with 1% Triton X-100 in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 2 mmNa3VO4, 100 mm NaF, and protease inhibitors. The protocol for immunoprecipitation with monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody or affinity purified rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies was described previously (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates (500 μg) were mixed with 500 μl of hybridoma culture supernatant containing monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody 1D4 or 20 μg of affinity purified rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies. Control immunoprecipitates were prepared by substitution of the 1D4 supernatant with an equal volume of unconditioned culture supernatant or by substitution of the affinity purified rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies with an equal amount of irrelevant rabbit IgG. The samples were incubated for 3 h, mixed with 40 μl of UltraLink immobilized protein G (Pierce), and then incubated for an additional 1.5 h. The beads were washed four times and the proteins bound were released from the beads by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min. The samples were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to CH-ILKBP, ILK, PINCH-1, or PINCH-2 as specified in each experiment. For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-tagged full-length or mutant forms of PINCH-2, cells expressing the FLAG-tagged PINCH-2 proteins and control cells lacking the FLAG-tagged PINCH-2 proteins were lysed as described above. The cell lysates (500 μg) were mixed with 40 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged PINCH-2 proteins and the associated proteins were released from the beads by boiling in 60 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer for 5 min and analyzed by Western blotting (20 μl/lane) with antibodies as specified in each experiment. Cells (as specified in each experiment) were plated in Opti-MEM I serum-free medium (Invitrogen) in wells of 96-well plates that were coated with 0.1 μg/ml fibronectin. The plates were incubated at 37 °C under a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere and the cell morphology was observed under an Olympus IX70 fluorescence microscope equipped with an Hoffman Modulation Contrast system. The images were recorded with a DVC-1310C MagnafireTM digital camera (Optronics). Unspread cells were defined as round cells, whereas spread cells were defined as cells with extended processes as described (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J.

The percentage of cells adopting spread morphology was quantified by analyzing at least 300 cells from three randomly selected fields (>100 cells/field) (15Tu Y. Huang Y. Zhang Z. Hua Y. Wu C. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 585-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol.

Guo L. Chen K. Wu C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 318-326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in complete medium on 24-well plates and grown for 24 h to reach confluence. The monolayers were then wounded by scratching with a plastic pipette tip. After washing, the cells were incubated in complete media for the indicated times and observed under an Olympus IX70 microscope equipped with an Hoffman Modulation Contrast system. Images of three different segments of the cell-free area were recorded with a DVC-1310C MagnafireTM digital camera (Optronics), and the distances traveled by the cells at the front in three different segments of the wound were measured. To clone the full-length cDNA of human PINCH-2, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR on poly(A)+ RNA isolated from human RD cells using primers for a putative open reading frame (GenBankTM accession numberAK022470). A major cDNA with a size of approximate 1 kb was obtained (Fig. 1 A, lane 5). In control experiments, no DNA was amplified with the same primers when the template was omitted (Fig. 1 A, lane 6) or when PINCH-1 cDNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 2) or an irrelevant cDNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 3) was used as a template, confirming the specificity of the reactions. The cDNA obtained from the human RD cells was sequenced. It encodes a protein encompassing the previously described partial PINCH-2 sequence (22Hobert O. Moerman D.G. Clark K.A. Beckerle M.C. Ruvkun G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The full-length human PINCH-2 consists of five LIM domains, each of which contains a sequence motif CXXCX 16–18C/HXXC/HXXCXXCX 16–18CXXC/H/D (the full-length nucleotide sequence and the deduced protein sequence of PINCH-2 derived from the human RD cells have been deposited into GenBankTM (accession number AF484961)). BLAST search of the human genome data base indicates that the gene encoding PINCH-2 is located within the human chromosome 2q14.3 region. Human PINCH-2 is 82% identical to human PINCH-1 at the amino acid sequence level. Analyses of DNA sequences suggest that they are not splicing variants but are instead encoded by two different genes. To test whether PINCH-2 and PINCH-1 are co-expressed in human cells, we carried out reverse transcription-PCR on poly(A)+ RNA from human RD cells using primers specific for PINCH-1. A major cDNA with the predicted PINCH-1 size was amplified (Fig. 1 B, lane 2). In control experiments, no DNA was amplified with the PINCH-1 primers when the template was omitted (Fig. 1 B, lane 6), or when an irrelevant cDNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 3) or PINCH-2 cDNA (Fig. 1 B, lane 4), which was readily amplified with the PINCH-2 primers (Fig. 1 A,lane 4), was used as a template. Taken together, these results suggest that PINCH-2 and PINCH-1 transcripts are co-expressed in human RD cells. To facilitate studies on PINCH-2, we generated an anti-PINCH-2 antibody by immunizing rabbits with a peptide containing a specific PINCH-2 sequence. Western blotting analyses of lysates of Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with expression vectors encoding GFP- and FLAG-tagged human PINCH-2 or PINCH-1 showed that the rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antiserum recognized the recombinant human PINCH-2 (Fig.2 A, lane 2) but not the PINCH-1 protein (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). In control experiments, no protein from the Chinese hamster ovary transfectants was recognized by preimmune rabbit serum under the same conditions (Fig. 2 B). The expression of the GFP- and FLAG-tagged recombinant human PINCH-2 (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) and PINCH-1 (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) proteins in the corresponding transfectants was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-FLAG antibody. To test whether the rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antiserum recognizes endogenous human PINCH-2 protein, we probed lysates of human WI-38 cells by Western blotting with the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum. The results show that the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum recognized a protein band with an apparent molecular weight similar to the calculated molecular weight of human PINCH-2 protein (38,917.03) (Fig. 2 D,lane 1). Binding of the antibody to the ∼39-kDa endogenous protein was completely blocked by incubation of the antiserum with the PINCH-2 peptide (Fig. 2 D, lane 2), indicating that the ∼39-kDa band represents the endogenous human PINCH-2 protein. Several additional protein bands with higher or lower molecular weights were also detected (Fig. 2 D, lane 1). However, they unlikely represent proteins specifically recognized by the anti-PINCH-2 antibody, as they were not blocked by the PINCH-2 peptide (Fig. 2 D, lane 2). To confirm that the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum recognizes PINCH-2 but not PINCH-1, we reprobed the membrane that had been probed with the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum (Fig. 2 D, lane 1) with an antibody recognizing PINCH-1. The result showed that the PINCH-1 protein, which migrated faster than PINCH-2 (the calculated molecular weight of PINCH-1 = 37,251.32) and was not recognized by the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum (Fig. 2 D, lane 1), was readily detected with the anti-PINCH-1 antibody in the same cell lysates (Fig.2 D, lane 3). These results confirm the specificity of the anti-PINCH-2 antiserum. Furthermore, they show that PINCH-2 and PINCH-1 are co-expressed in human WI-38 cells. Western blotting analyses of other human cell types including RD cells, A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, IMR-90 lung cells, HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells, embryonal kidney 293 cells, and primary glomerular mesangial cells revealed that PINCH-2 is also co-expressed with PINCH-1 in these cells (data not shown). We next analyzed the subcellular localization of PINCH-2. To do this, we purified the anti-PINCH-2 antibodies with an affinity column containing the PINCH-2 peptide (Fig. 3 A). The affinity purified antibodies specifically recognized PINCH-2 (Fig.3 A, lane 2), whereas the flow-through fractions failed to recognize PINCH-2 (Fig. 3 A, lane 3). Immunofluorescent staining of human cells with the affinity purified anti-PINCH-2 antibody showed that PINCH-2 localizes to both focal adhesions and the nucleus (Fig. 3 B). No focal adhesion or nuclear staining was observed with the flow-through fraction (Fig.3 C), confirming the specificity of the PINCH-2 immunofluorescent staining. Double staining of the cells with the affinity purified rabbit anti-PINCH-2 antibodies and mouse anti-ILK antibody 65.1 showed that PINCH-2 is co-clustered with ILK in focal adhesions (Fig. 3, D and E). Interestingly, although abundant PINCH-2 was detected in the nucleus (Fig.3 D), ILK was absent in the nucleus (Fig. 3 E). As expected, the clusters of PINCH-2 at the focal adhesions (Fig.3 F), which are docking sites for actin stress fibers at the cell-extracellular matrix adhesion sites, are co-aligned with actin filaments (Fig. 3 G). To test whether PINCH-2 forms a complex with ILK, we immunoprecipitated CH-ILKBP and ILK from human cell lysates with a monoclonal anti-CH-ILKBP antibody. Western blotting analyses of the anti-CH-ILKBP immunoprecipitates with antibodies to CH-ILKBP, ILK, PINCH-1, and PINCH-2 revealed that both PINCH-2 (Fig.4 D, lane 2) and PINCH-1 (Fig. 4 C, lane 2) were co-immunoprecipitated with ILK (Fig. 4 B, lane 2) and CH-ILKBP (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). In control experiments, no specific proteins (CH-ILKBP, ILK, PINCH-1, or PINCH-2) were precipitated from the lysates when the anti-CH-ILKBP hybridoma supernatant was substituted with unconditioned culture supernatant (data not shown). To confirm that PINCH-2 forms a complex with ILK, we immunoprecipitated PINCH-2 from cell lysates with the affinity purified anti-PINCH-2 antibody. Analyses of the anti-PINCH-2 immunoprecipitates with monoclonal anti-ILK antibody showed that ILK (Fig. 4 F,lane 2) was readily co-immunoprecipitated with PINCH-2 (Fig.4 E, lane 2). In control experiments, no ILK was detected in the control immunoprecip"

It is composed of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ, and mutations to these subunits can lead to the salt wasting disease pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, associated with decreased channel density at the plasma membrane or to the hypertensive disorder, Liddle’s syndrome, in which channel residency time at the plasma membrane is enhanced. Regulation of ENaC trafficking and turnover is therefore critical to sodium homeostasis. In this study we examined whether ENaC is present in the cholesterol-enriched microdomains commonly called lipid rafts, in the endogenously expressing A6 cell line. We demonstrate that a fraction of α, β, and γ ENaC is present in detergent-insoluble membranes, that subunits exist in membranes that float on discontinuous sucrose density gradients, and that methyl-β-cyclodextrin treatment causes a redistribution of ENaC subunits to higher density membranes. Furthermore, chronic aldosterone stimulation results in a shift in the membrane density of all three subunits. Biotinylation of apical membrane proteins revealed that ENaC is present in lipid rafts on the plasma membrane. In conclusion, these results show that ENaC is present in lipid rafts both intracellularly and on the cell surface. Raft association may be important for trafficking and/or function of the channel.

Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). It is composed of three homologous subunits, α, β, and γ, which form a heteromultimeric protein likely to be comprised of two α subunits and one each of β and γ. These subunits are characterized by two membrane-spanning domains, short intracellular N and C termini, and a large ectodomain (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In humans, mutations to this channel are known to be responsible for pseudohypoaldosteronism type I, a salt-wasting disease of infants, and Liddle’s syndrome, which results in severe hypertension. In the former, mutations to α, β, and γ result in loss-of-function due to lower channel density at the plasma membrane (2Bonny O. Chraibi A. Loffing J. Jaeger N.F. Grunder S. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Conversely, in the latter, deletions or mutations to PY motifs in the C termini of β or γ result in a gain-of-function which appears to result from increased residency time at the plasma membrane (3Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Since both diseases result from altered trafficking and/or turnover of the channel it is of vital importance to understand the regulation of these processes. Recent studies from our laboratory have suggested that the trafficking and turnover of ENaC subunits may be regulated independently (4Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Chronic aldosterone treatment of A6 cells, for example, dramatically increased levels of β at the cell surface concomitant with increases in Na+ conductance, while levels of α and γ remained unchanged. If channel subunits have distinctly different half-lives at the surface and if selective insertion and retrieval of channel subunits can regulate Na+reabsorption, then biosynthesis and subunit trafficking are critically important to this process. Membrane microdomains known as lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids and have been shown to exist as dynamic platforms important for the delivery of proteins to the apical membrane as well as for sequestering proteins in close physical proximity for functional interactions (5Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 6Simons K. Toomre D. Nat. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (5187) Google Scholar). These structures are characterized by their detergent insolubility and high buoyant density. Since mature ENaC has been described as being detergent-insoluble when expressed in COS7 and HEK293 cells (7Prince L.S. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1346-C1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that raft localization might represent a cellular mechanism for controlling ENaC subunit density at the plasma membrane and/or ENaC subunit interactions. In addition, a number of proteins known to interact with ENaC have been localized to lipid rafts, most notably the ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 (8Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which plays a role in ENaC turnover at the plasma membrane (3Snyder P.M. Price M.P. McDonald F.J. Adams C.M. Volk K.A. Zeiher B.G. Stokes J.B. Welsh M.J. Cell. 1995; 83: 969-978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Therefore we have examined whether ENaC may be present in lipid rafts in the endogenously expressing A6 cell line. Our results indicate that all three subunits are present in lipid rafts and that the membrane microenvironment that ENaC exists within is altered by exposure to aldosterone. A6 cells were seeded at high density and grown on 75-mm permeable supports (0.4 μm pore, Costar, Cambridge, MA or Millipore, Bedford, MA) in amphibian medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were maintained at 28 °C in 5% CO2 and were not used for experiments for at least 8 days. Current and resistance measurements across confluent monolayers were performed using an EVOM “chopstick” device (World Precision Instruments, Stevenage, UK). Cells were used for experiments if resistances were at least 800 Ω and currents of at least 1.5 μA/cm2 were recorded. Confluent cells with high resistances and Isc readings were scraped from filters into TNE buffer (in mm: Tris-HCl, 25; NaCl, 150; EDTA, 5; pH 7.4) containing protease inhibitors (PIs; Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), disrupted by suction through a 22-gauge syringe and a post-nuclear supernatant (PNS) recovered after 1500 × gcentrifugation for 5 min. Ice-cold Triton X-100 (final 1%) was added to the PNS for a 30 min. incubation on ice. Insoluble and soluble membranes were recovered following centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 60 min), and insoluble membranes in the pellet were then dissolved in Triton X-100 and incubated at 28 °C for 30 min. Aliquots of soluble and insoluble membranes were added to sample buffer and boiled for 2 min prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Western blots were probed with ENaC subunit-specific antibodies as described in Refs. 9Rokaw M.D. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Weisz O.A. Hui D. Middleton P. Shlyonsky V. Berdiev B.K. Ismailov I.

Briefly, cells were scraped into 2 ml of 500 mm sodium carbonate, pH 11, after washing three times with ice-cold PBS (all buffers and sucrose solutions contained PIs). Cell lysates and a PNS fraction were then prepared as described above. PNS membranes were left untreated or were treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 60 min at 28 °C. Samples (2 ml) were mixed with 2 ml 90% sucrose in 25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6.5, and placed in a centrifuge tube. The sample was then overlaid with 4 ml of 35% and 4 ml of 5% sucrose before centrifugation at 190,000 ×g(av) for 18 h at 4 °C.

Total proteins from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with ENaC subunit-specific antibodies as described (4Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S.

Xenopuscaveolin was detected using an N-terminal specific antibody, which was raised against human caveolin-1 and cross-reacts with mouse and rat caveolin-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). To confirm that the band being detected was indeed caveolin, we immunoblotted A6 cell membranes that had been separated on sucrose density gradients with another commercially available antibody with reactivity to caveolin isoforms 1, 2, and 3 (BD PharMingen, Lexington, KY). This antibody recognized a band at 22 kDa, which floated in fractions 4 and 5 of the gradient and which ran with the same relative mobility as a positive caveolin control provided by the company (data not shown), thus confirming the specificity of the Santa Cruz antibody. Flotillin 2 antibody was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Confluent transporting monolayers of A6 cells were treated with 1 μm aldosterone for 18 h at 28 °C. Sucrose gradient centrifugation was then performed as described above. Cells were washed three times with cold PBS and a total of 2.5 mg sulfo-NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) in a volume of 5 ml of ice-cold borate buffer (in mm: NaCl, 85; KCl, 4; Na2B4O7, 15; pH 9.0) was added to the apical side of polarized A6 cells grown on 75-mm filters. Ice-cold amphibian medium was placed basally and plates were rocked gently on ice for 20 min. Biotin solution was removed, and cold amphibian medium was added apically to quench remaining biotin reagent for 5 min. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS, scraped, a PNS prepared, and then membranes were subjected to discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation as described above. Fractions collected from the gradient were incubated overnight at 4 °C with streptavidin-linked agarose beads. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed three times with Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P40, 0.4% deoxycholate, 50 mm EGTA, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), and then sample buffer was added prior to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Band densities were quantitated using Quantity One software from Bio-Rad. When A6 cells were extracted with cold Triton X-100 a fraction of all three ENaC subunits appeared in the insoluble pellet (Fig.1A), suggesting that ENaC might be present in lipid rafts. To determine whether the Triton-insoluble subunits were raft localized we utilized a non-detergent, discontinuous sucrose gradient method for separating membranes of differing buoyant density. When PNS membranes from A6 cells were subjected to discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation (Fig. 1B), it could be shown that a proportion of each subunit was recovered in low density fractions 4 and 5 (γ-ENaC is shown) and that flotillin and caveolin, markers of the specific lipid raft subset known as caveolae, also colocalized to these fractions (13Bickel P.E. Scherer P.E. Schnitzer J.E., Oh, P. Lisanti M.P. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13793-13802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). This portion of the gradient corresponds to the interface between 5 and 35% sucrose. Densitometry confirmed that the distribution of γ-ENaC and caveolae between different membrane compartments was similar (Fig. 1C). This finding demonstrated that ENaC subunits are found in the kinds of low density membranes that fit one of the functional definitions of cholesterol-enriched lipid rafts. To further verify that these membranes represented lipid rafts, PNS membranes were treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (CD) for 1 h at room temperature. CD is a cholesterol-sequestering drug that disrupts the hydrogen bonding interactions between cholesterol and sphingolipids which promote lipid raft formation. Fig.2 demonstrates that CD treatment results in a significant shift of ENaC subunits to higher density membranes consistent with the loss of cholesterol and disruption of lipid raft structures. Densitometry confirmed that there was a dramatic decrease in low density ENaC and a concomitant increase in channel found at higher density (Fig. 2B). When membranes treated with CD were immunoblotted for caveolin a similar redistribution was observed (bottom two panels of Fig. 2A). Densitometry revealed that the amount of caveolin remaining in raft-like membranes after CD was dramatically reduced.Figure 2ENaC Subunits shift from low density membranes to high density membranes upon treatment with cyclodextrin.A, polarized A6 cells grown on filters were scraped, and a PNS was prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PNSs were left untreated (−) or were treated with 10 mmcyclodextrin (+) for 1 h at room temperature and then subjected to discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation as described. Fractions (1 ml) were collected with fraction 1 being the top of the gradient. Proteins were chloroform/methanol-precipitated, run on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies to x-ENaC subunits or to caveolin.B, densitometric quantitation of the immunoblot analysis shown to the left in A.

After 18-h exposure to aldosterone (1 μm), it could be seen that there was a highly reproducible shift in the buoyant density of all three subunits (Fig.3). β- and γ-ENaC were predominantly located in fraction 4 under control conditions but shifted almost entirely to fraction 5 following aldosterone exposure. For α-ENaC this shift was less dramatic. For all three subunits there was the appearance of a significant proportion of the total subunit pool in higher density fractions (8Plant P.J. Lafont F.

Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3190) Google Scholar). Interestingly, caveolin was also observed to shift from fraction 4 to fraction 5 upon aldosterone treatment, with the appearance of greater amounts in high density membranes. Because a large proportion of the ENaC pool is known to reside intracellularly, we wished to examine whether ENaC subunits exist within rafts at the cell surface. Biotinylation of apical cell surface proteins and subsequent isolation using streptavidin beads revealed that ENaC was present in lipid rafts (fractions 4 and 5) in the apical plasma membrane (Fig. 4, PM). Whole cell (WC) lysates are shown for comparison and demonstrate an approximately equivalent distribution between low and high density membranes as can be seen at the cell surface. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored and acylated proteins have been found associated with lipid rafts, and it has been hypothesized that these cholesterol-rich microdomains offer a molecular scaffolding for the concentration of proteins involved in ligand binding and signal transduction as well as in protein sorting at the level of the trans-Golgi network. Proteins that preferentially localize to rafts often have long saturated acyl chains and therefore exhibit a high affinity for liquid-ordered domains (5Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z.

J. 2000; 79: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); however, hydrophobicity alone does not seem to be sufficient for raft localization, as prenylated proteins are excluded (5Melkonian K.A.

J. 2000; 79: 919-933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). As a consequence of these observations, ion channels with multiple membrane-spanning domains were assumed to have little affinity for liquid-ordered membrane domains (5Melkonian K.A. Ostermeyer A.G. Chen J.Z. Roth M.G. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3910-3917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). However, in the last 2 years there have been a limited but growing number of reports demonstrating ion channel association with rafts. These channels include the voltage and Ca2+-activated K+ channel α subunit (hSlo) (15Bravo-Zehnder M. Orio P. Norambuena A. Wallner M. Meera P. Toro L. Latorre R. Gonzalez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13114-13119Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv2.1 (but not Kv4.2), which is found in non-caveolar lipid rafts (16Martens J.R. Navarro-Polanco R. Coppock E.A. Nishiyama A. Parshley L. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7443-7446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar); the voltage-gated K+ channel Kv1.5, which is localized to caveolae (17Martens J.R. Sakamoto N. Sullivan S.A. Grobaski T.D. Tamkun M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8409-8414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar); the endothelial volume-regulated anion channel (18Trouet D. Hermans D. Droogmans G. Nilius B. Eggermont J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar); and the voltage-gated sodium channel of cardiac myocytes (19Yarbrough T.L., Lu, T. Lee H.-C. Shibata E.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), which also localizes to caveolae. The authors in the latter study postulated that observed increases in sodium current in response to β-adrenergic stimulation were occurring as the result of movement of sodium channel out of caveolae and into the sarcolemma. It now appears highly likely that specific ion channels may traffic in, or to, distinct liquid-ordered membrane domains and that their activity might be regulated by these microdomains at the cell surface. Experiments aimed at defining the membrane microdomain association of ENaC as well as its subcellular distribution are relatively difficult to perform in endogenously expressing cells due to the low abundance of channel protein. As a consequence, a number of groups have used heterologous expression systems that are able to generate higher amounts of protein, as a means to address this question. Prince and Welsh (7Prince L.S. Welsh M.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C1346-C1351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that human ENaC subunits when expressed individually or concurrently in COS-7 or HEK293 cells acquire detergent insolubility at the post-endoplasmic reticulum stage of biosynthesis and that virtually all of the ENaC expressed at the cell surface is detergent-insoluble. These authors speculate that detergent insolubility may be the result of associations with caveolar or cytoskeletal proteins or alternatively be due to self-oligomerization. They did not characterize the buoyant density of their ENaC-containing membranes or attempt to alter the lipid composition of these membranes; therefore a number of interpretations, including lipid raft localization, are possible. In contrast, Hanwell et al. (20Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) expressed rat ENaC in MDCK cells and showed that ENaC was Triton-soluble and did not float on Optiprep density gradients, thus demonstrating that ENaC in this system was not associated with lipid rafts. To investigate further we turned to A6 cells, which endogenously express Xenopus ENaC and which show appropriate hormone responsiveness. Our results clearly demonstrate that a fraction of both intracellular and plasma membrane ENaC is associated with lipid rafts by four different biochemical criteria: 1) detergent insolubility, 2) high buoyant density after extraction in 0.5 mNa2CO3, pH 11.0, 3) colocalization with caveolin and flotillin, and 4) a dependence on cholesterol for partitioning into high buoyant density membranes. The reasons for differences in our findings from those of Hanwell et al.(20Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) are not clear, but may reflect the use of a heterologous expression system, overexpression, or the use of detergentversus non-detergent extraction methods for isolating cellular membranes. Our results demonstrate that a proportion of all three ENaC subunits in the Na+-transporting A6 epithelium are lipid raft localized and that this compartmentalization persists at the plasma membrane. The physiological relevance of such compartmentalization is unclear, but the observation that ENaC subunits can be shifted to membranes of higher density upon aldosterone treatment suggests strongly that their membrane domain localization is regulated by appropriate physiological stimuli. Indeed, aldosterone is known to alter membrane lipid composition through effects on phospholipid turnover and composition (21Wiesmann W.P. Johnson J.P. Miura G.A. Chaing P.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: F43-F47Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Goodman D.B. Wong M. Rasmussen H. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 2803-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Lien E.L. Goodman D.B.

Biol. 2000; 73: 11-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) as well as through phospholipid methylation (26Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Lipid rafts may represent a way for the cell to get ENaC to the correct cellular destination i.e. the apical membrane, at which point subunits or complete channels having been delivered appropriately may redistribute out of rafts and enter the bulk lipid phase. Alternatively, ion channel function may be regulated in part by the biophysical properties of the membrane. Rafts may even represent a means for the cell to regulate the half-life of subunits present at the cell surface. Only a fraction of channel subunits that are synthesized appear to reach plasma membrane in epithelial cells (4Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 20Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol.

Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The half-life of channel subunits that reach the plasma membrane is a subject of some dispute. Using an approach measuring recovery of apically biotinylated subunits two groups have estimated a half-life of hours for individual subunits in A6 cells (4Weisz O.A. Wang J.M. Edinger R.S. Johnson J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39886-39893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Kleyman T.R. Zuckerman J.B. Middleton P. McNulty K.A., Hu, B., Su, X., An, B. Eaton D.C. Smith P.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F213-F221Google Scholar). Using a similar approach in MDCK cells, combined with inhibition of new channel synthesis with cycloheximide, Hanwell et al. (20Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) described a half-life closer to 1 h (20Hanwell D. Ishikawa T. Saleki R. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9772-9779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and Alvarez De La Rosa et al. (27Alvarez De La Rosa D.A., Li, H. Canessa C.M. J. Gen. Physiol. 2002; 119: 427-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have recently estimated half-lives of 12–17 min in A6 cells. Using an electrophysiologic approach, Fisher and colleagues (28Fisher R.S. Grillo F.G. Sariban-Sohraby S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C138-C147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) described a decline in apical channel density over a period of hours following inhibition of apical delivery by brefeldin A in A6 cells. Whatever the half-life of apical channels may be, sequestration of subunits in rafts could represent a means for the cell to maintain subunit or channel pools in inactive conformations or to target them for internalization. Many, if not most, of the proteins implicated in clathrin-independent endocytosis have been found in lipid rafts (29Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Indeed, Nedd4, the ubiquitin ligase that regulates internalization of ENaC through binding to PY motifs in the C termini of the β and γ subunits, is a raft-localized protein (30Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Since a physical interaction between ENaC and Nedd4 is necessary for ubiquitination, it is tempting to speculate that raft localization of ENaC is linked to the process of ubiquitin-regulated internalization. This possibility is rendered somewhat less likely by the observation that the C2 domain of Nedd4, which apparently mediates the raft association, and apical localization of Nedd4–1 in MDCK cells (8Plant P.J. Lafont F. Lecat S. Verkade P. Simons K. Rotin D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1473-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 30Plant P.J. Yeger H. Staub O. Howard P. Rotin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32329-32336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) is not required for the action of Nedd4–2, a predominantly kidney-expressed isoform, inXenopus oocytes (31Kamynina E. Tauxe C. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: F469-F477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether lipid association of Nedd4 isoforms is essential to Nedd4 apical localization and function in epithelia remains to be determined. Finally, since lipid raft-localized proteins have been shown to shuttle repeatedly and rapidly between the plasma membrane and the Golgi (32Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it also potentially represents a way for the cell to exert precise regulatory control over cell surface expression of ENaC and is consistent with the fact that the majority of ENaC exists intracellularly. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that endogenously expressed ENaC subunits exist within cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains. Further investigation will be required to define how lipid rafts influence ENaC trafficking, function, and turnover."
https://openalex.org/W1981334243,"The yeast transcriptional activator Adr1 controls the expression of genes required for ethanol, glycerol, and fatty acid utilization. We show that Adr1 acts directly on the promoters ofADH2, ACS1, GUT1, CTA1, and POT1 using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The yeast homolog of the AMP-activated protein kinase, Snf1, promotes Adr1 chromatin binding in the absence of glucose, and the protein phosphatase complex, Glc7·Reg1, represses its binding in the presence of glucose. A post-translational process is implicated in the regulation of Adr1 binding activity. Chromatin binding by Adr1 is not the only step in ADH2 transcription that is regulated by glucose repression. Adr1 can bind to chromatin in repressed conditions in the presence of hyperacetylated histones. To study steps subsequent to promoter binding we utilized miniAdr1 transcription factors to characterize Adr1-dependent transcription in vitro. Yeast nuclear extracts prepared from glucose-repressed and glucose-derepressed cells are equally capable of supporting miniAdr1-dependent transcription and pre-initiation complex formation. Nuclear extracts prepared from a snf1 mutant support miniAdr1-dependent transcription but are partially defective in the formation of pre-initiation complexes with Mediator components being particularly depleted. We conclude that Snf1 regulates Adr1-dependent transcription primarily at the level of chromatin binding."

The systematic association of these motifs with specific ligand molecules in unrelated protein sequences raises the question of their role in protein-ligand structure, stability, and recognition. To be able to follow the protein folding process or the association of a protein with other (macro)molecules, by computer or real experiments, it is essential to have a fundamental knowledge of the energetic and entropic factors that drive these processes or to be able to precisely reproduce them by means of the correct descriptors. Indeed, even though the inter- and intramolecular non-covalent interactions, including electrostatic, hydrogen bond, London, Pauli, and electron charge transfer contributions, are known in principle, we still have a limited appreciation of their precise nature and of the way in which they compete or reinforce one another in complex systems. In particular, the importance of cation-π interactions between aromatic rings and positive charges has only recently started to be appreciated in the biomolecular context (1Dougherty D.A. Science. 1996; 271: 163-168Google Scholar, 2Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Google Scholar), and the question regarding their true nature is far from settled. Both experimental and theoretical studies have emphasized the presence of this favorable interaction in protein structure (3Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12088-12093Google Scholar). Cation-π interactions have also been shown to be quite common at the interface between protein and DNA (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar, 11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar), where they involve positively charged Arg or Lys side chains and aromatic rings of nucleic acid bases. According to ab initio calculations the most favorable energy is obtained with Gua bases; hence, cation-π interactions contribute to the specificity of protein-DNA recognition. Related interactions, termed amino-π or simply cation-π interactions, involve a partial instead of a full positive charge, carried by the polar amino acids Asn or Gln (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar, 11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar, 12Burley S.K. Petsko G.A.

These amino acids, albeit globally neutral, possess a partial positive charge δ(+) on the amino group of their side chain amide group, which, when positioned above the aromatic ring, forms a cation-π interaction. Such interactions have been observed at the interface between protein and DNA (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar, 11Rooman M. Liévin J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7103-7110Google Scholar), but their favorable nature has not yet been demonstrated. Biological processes such as enzymatic reactions generally need cofactor molecules to perform catalytic transformations of substrates. Most of these intervening molecules include nucleic acid bases in their molecular structure, and we shall focus on them. These nucleobases contribute to the protein-ligand binding but are not directly involved in the biological processes and thus not chemically altered during the catalytic reaction. One main group of cofactors embodies ATP/ADP, GTP/GDP, and CTP/CDP containing an Ade, Gua, and Cyt base, respectively. When bound to their target, they liberate a phosphate group by hydrolysis of the high energy phosphoanhydride bonds and constitute the most important energy source for the cell. Another important group of cofactors comprehends NAD and FAD, which are involved in the transfer of an electron pair from reduced NAD or FAD to the final electron acceptor in an elaborate electron transport cascade. The electrons pass through a series of discrete steps that permit the gradual harvesting of electron energy, whose dissipation is coupled to the synthesis of ATP molecules. The present study is focused on probing the structural and biological role of amino acid-nucleobase cation-π interactions and lies within the scope of our recent research devoted to protein-DNA complexes (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar,11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar). Here, we consider proteins bound to ligand molecules and cation-π interactions linking the nucleobases contained in these molecules to amino acid side chain groups carrying a net or partial positive charge. In particular, we searched a non-redundant structure set of protein-ligand complexes for cation-π interactions and performed ab initio quantum mechanics energy calculations on all recorded cation-π pairs. The conservation of these interactions in families of related proteins was also investigated, so as to further evaluate their importance compared with other non-covalent interactions. The agreement and sometimes disagreement between the frequent occurrence of specific cation-π interactions in x-ray structures and their computed energies is debated. Finally, we discuss the predominance of Ade-containing ligands. To generate a non-redundant set of protein-ligand complexes, we first extracted from the ReLiBase (16Hendlich M. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1178-1182Google Scholar) data base the list of all protein structures complexed with a ligand containing Ade, Gua, Cyt, or Thy, deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) (17Berman H.M. Westbrook J. Feng Z. Gilliland G. Bhat T.N. Weissig H. Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 235-242Google Scholar) and having a resolution of 2.0 Å or better. This yielded 580 protein-ligand complexes. We then extracted from these complexes a subset that contained only protein chains displaying less than 25% sequence identity. Information on sequence identity was gathered from the FSSP fold classification data base (18Holm L. Sander C. Science. 1996; 273: 595-602Scopus (1287) Google Scholar). In this way, we obtained a final set of 188 protein-ligand structures. The subset of these structures containing protein-ligand cation-π interactions is listed under “Supplementary Material.” We define cation-π interactions geometrically by a distance and an angle criterion (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar). The distance criterion requires that at least one of the atoms of the aromatic ring is located no further than 4.5 Å from one of the atoms carrying the positive charge (i.e.Nη1, Nη2, Cζ, or Nε for Arg and Nζ or Cε for Lys) or the partial positive charge (i.e.Nε2 or Cδ for Gln and Nδ2 or Cγ for Asn). Note that nitrogen atoms are considered instead of hydrogen atoms because the latter are lacking in x-ray structures. Atoms carrying a partial positive charge designate atoms where the intramolecular electron distribution presents a positive peak due to a lack of electrons. The angle criterion requires that the (partially) positively charged atom is situated above the plane defined by the aromatic ring, more precisely, inside a cylinder of height 4.5 Å, whose base includes the ring and has a radius equal to the ring diameter. Each pair was reduced to a simple system that could be studied computationally. The ligands were reduced to the nucleic acid base they contain. Lys and Arg were represented as ammonium and guanidinium groups, respectively, and Gln and Asn as formamide groups. In the case of Lys, two different orientations of the ammonium moiety toward the π-electron cloud were considered, with one of the N–H bonds pointing either toward the aromatic ring or in the opposite direction. Allab initio energy calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 98 suite of programs (19Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schelgel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery J.A. Stratmann Jr., R.E. Burant J.C. Dapprich S. Millam J.M. Daniels A.D. Kudin K.N. Strain M.C. Farkas O. Tomasi J. Barone V. Cossi M. Cammi R. Mennucci B. Pomelli C. Adamo C. Clifford S. Ochterski J. Petersson G.A. Ayala P.Y. Cui Q. Morokuma K. Malick D.K. Rabuck A.D. Raghavachari K. Foresman J.B. Cioslowski J. Ortiz J.V. Baboul A.G. Stefanov B.B. Liu G. Liashenko A. Piskorz P. Komaromi I. Gomperts R. Martin R.L. Fox D.J. Keith T., Al- Laham M.A. Peng C.Y. Nanayakkara A. Gonzalez C. Challacombe M. Gill P.M.W. Replogle S. Pople J.A. Gaussian 98, Revision A. 7. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1998Google Scholar). In a first step, the nucleic acid bases as well as the ammonium, guanidinium, and formamide groups, which represent the cation-π partners, were optimized separately, using the Hartree-Fock method (HF) and the 6-31G** basis set. The optimized coordinates were then superimposed onto the crystal coordinates using the U3BEST algorithm (20Kabsch W. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1978; 34: 827-828Google Scholar). In a second step, the energies of the cation-π systems were calculated at second order level of Møller-Plesset pertubation theory (MP2) (21Sponer J. Leszczynski J. Hobza P. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 5590-5596Google Scholar). The basis set used is 6-31G**(0.2), which corresponds to the standard 6-31G** basis set where the Gaussian αd-exponent of the d-polarization functions on the heavy atoms C, N, and O is equal to 0.8, with an additional αd-exponent equal to 0.2. It has indeed been shown that this extended description of the d-polarization functions allows a more accurate description of cation-π interactions (21Sponer J. Leszczynski J. Hobza P. J. Phys. Chem. 1996; 100: 5590-5596Google Scholar,22Hobza P. Sponer J. Chem. Rev. 1999; 99: 3247-3276Google Scholar). 1R. Wintjens, C. Biot, M. Rooman, and J. Liévin, submitted manuscript. The interaction energy ΔEMP2 is calculated as the sum of the Hartree-Fock energy ΔEHF and a correlation energy contribution ΔECOR, evaluated here in Equation 1 as the second order term of the Møller-Plesset perturbation expansion. ΔEMP2=ΔEHF+ΔECOREquation 1 For a given complex A-B, ΔEHF and ΔECOR are evaluated as the differences at HF and MP2 level, respectively, between the energy of the complex E(A-B) and the energies of isolated partners of the system, E(A) and E(B) as shown in Equations 2 and 3. ΔEHF=EHF(A­B)−EHF(A)−EHF(B)Equation 2 ΔECOR=ECOR(A­B)−ECOR(A)−ECOR(B)Equation 3 ΔEHF contains electrostatic, polarization, electron transfer, and exchange energy contributions, while ΔECOR contains electron correlation (dispersion) contributions. Together, they are expected to represent the major contributions to the Van der Waals energy. All calculations were corrected for the basis set superposition error (BSSE) by using the standard function counterpoise (CP) method (24Jansen H.B. Ros P. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1969; 3: 140-143Google Scholar,25Boys S.F. Bernardi F. Mol. Phys. 1970; 19: 553-566Google Scholar). Details on the ab initio calculation methods can be found in Ref. 10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar. To investigate the conservation of the cation-π motifs in related proteins, we scanned the PIR annotation and similarity data base. 2pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/. The PIR protein entry displaying the highest degree of sequence identity with the considered PDB sequence (found to vary between 98 and 100%) was used as probe. The sequences similar to each probe and belonging to the same family as classified in the PIR data base, were collected with the FASTA sequence alignment program (27Pearson W.R. Lipman D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2444-2448Google Scholar) using the threshold e-value < 0.0001. Within each family, we discarded protein sequences shorter than 75% of the original PDB sequence. The conservation of the amino acids forming the cation-π motif was evaluated on the basis of multiple sequence alignments performed with the ClustalW program (28Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Google Scholar). A non-redundant dataset of 188 high-resolution x-ray structures of protein-ligand complexes, defined as described under “Materials and Methods,” was searched for cation-π interactions linking protein to ligand. All the ligand molecules considered contain a nucleic acid base, which is however not directly involved in the enzymatic reaction. The overwhelming majority of the ligands (81%) contain an Ade; Gua, Thy, and Cyt only occur in 12, 4, and 3% of the ligands, respectively. These numbers could be biased, as our structure set contains few membrane proteins that are known to frequently bind Gua-containing ligands; however, a survey of sequence data bases confirms the abundance of Ade in ligands. The most frequent ligands are adenosine mono-, di-, or tri-phosphates (AMP, ADP, ATP) and ligands containing a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide moiety (NAD, NAP, NAQ, NDP): they occur 37 and 38 times in the structure set, respectively. We focused on cation-π interactions between an aromatic ring of the ligand's nucleic acid base and an Arg or Lys side chain carrying a net positive charge or an Asn or Gln side chain carrying a partial positive charge on its amino group. We did not consider cation-π interactions involving other aromatic moieties of the ligand, nor positively charged ligand groups interacting with aromatic amino acid side chains. We also overlooked His residues, due to their ubiquitous nature. They indeed play the role of cations under protonated form and behave like simple aromatic systems under unprotonated form. All these interactions are equally interesting to study, but fall outside the scope of the present work. In the set of 188 complexes, 77 protein-ligand cation-π interactions (see “Supplementary Material”) were identified using the geometrical criterion described under “Materials and Methods,” distributed over 71 structures (listed under “Supplementary Material”). More than half of these interactions (40 occurrences) involve Arg, followed by Lys (19Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schelgel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery J.A. Stratmann Jr., R.E. Burant J.C. Dapprich S. Millam J.M. Daniels A.D. Kudin K.N. Strain M.C. Farkas O. Tomasi J. Barone V. Cossi M. Cammi R. Mennucci B. Pomelli C. Adamo C. Clifford S. Ochterski J.

Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1998Google Scholar), Asn (12Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Google Scholar), and Gln (6Dougherty D.A. Kumpf R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 1708-1710Google Scholar). The frequency differences are even more marked for nucleic acid bases: by far the most frequent base is Ade (54 occurrences), followed by Gua (19Frisch M.J. Trucks G.W. Schelgel H.B. Scuseria G.E. Robb M.A. Cheeseman J.R. Zakrzewski V.G. Montgomery J.A. Stratmann Jr., R.E. Burant J.C. Dapprich S. Millam J.M. Daniels A.D. Kudin K.N. Strain M.C. Farkas O. Tomasi J. Barone V. Cossi M. Cammi R.

Pople J.A. Gaussian 98, Revision A. 7. Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh, PA1998Google Scholar), Thy (2Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Google Scholar), and Cyt (2Ma J.C. Dougherty D.A. Chem. Rev. 1997; 97: 1303-1324Google Scholar). In the case of Gua, the cation-π partner is always positioned above the 5-member cycle, whereas for Ade, this happens in 72% of the cases. With its 36 occurrences, the Arg-Ade is the preferred cation-π pair. Note that in 60% of the observed cation-π interactions, the charged group is positioned right above the aromatic cycle, and in the remaining interactions it is situated above the extracyclic atoms. The preferential occurrence of Arg residues in cation-π interactions is in agreement with previous observations in proteins (3Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Google Scholar, 12Burley S.K. Petsko G.A. FEBS Lett. 1986; 203: 139-143Google Scholar, 29Singh J. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 211: 595-615Google Scholar, 30Minoux H. Chipot C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10366-10372Google Scholar) and in protein-DNA complexes (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar, 31Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 1053-1095Google Scholar). The lower frequency of Asn and Gln residues compared with Arg and Lys also agrees with previous observations (13Mitchell J.B.O. Nandi C.L. McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 315-331Google Scholar) and is related to the fact that they carry only a partial positive charge on their side chain amino group. The observation that Ade is almost three times more frequently involved in cation-π interactions than Gua seems a priori in contradistinction with what happens in protein-DNA complexes where Gua is more frequent (10Wintjens R. Liévin J. Rooman M. Buisine E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 395-410Google Scholar). But it is not. Indeed, we find that 58% of the Gua-involving ligands form a cation-π interaction, against 40% for Ade-involving ligands. To probe the orientation of the Arg, Asn, and Gln side chains relative to the nucleic acid base, we computed the angle between the aromatic plane and that formed by the guanidinium group of Arg or the amide group of Asn or Gln side chains. This angle is, on average, equal to 32, 35, and 41° for Arg, Gln, and Asn, respectively. The planes are thus usually somewhat more parallel than perpendicular, which has already been noted for guanidinium groups in aqueous solution (32Duffy E.M., P.J. Jorgensen W.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 1115: 9271-9275Google Scholar) and in proteins (13Mitchell J.B.O. Nandi C.L. McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 315-331Google Scholar, 33Flocco M.M. Mowbray S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 709-717Google Scholar) although the perpendicular or T-shaped conformation seems more stable in vacuum (3Gallivan J.P. Dougherty D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9459-9464Google Scholar, 30Minoux H. Chipot C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 10366-10372Google Scholar). Moreover, the deviation from the stacked conformation is largest for Gln and Asn. This allows the partial positive charge carried by the amino group to be closer to the aromatic ring than the partial negative charge carried by the oxygen of the carbonyl group, thereby improving the electrostatic contribution (13Mitchell J.B.O. Nandi C.L. McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 315-331Google Scholar). Note that the deviation from the stacked conformation of Arg, Gln, and Asn is larger here than in the protein-DNA context (11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar), where the simultaneous formation of a double H-bond between the guanidinium or amide group and a subsequent nucleic acid base along the DNA stack imposes geometrical constraints favoring the parallel conformation. In some instances, two or more cation-π interactions occur concomitantly, hence forming cation-π chain motifs (11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar). Two types of chains motifs can be distinguished: either a side chain carrying a net or partial positive charge interacts with two aromatic rings (type π∴+∴π chain, where π denotes an aromatic cycle; +, a net or partial positive charge; and ∴ a cation-π interaction) or an aromatic ring interacts with two side chains carrying a net or partial positive charge (type +∴π∴+ chain). A total of 10 cation-π chains are identified in the set of protein-ligand complexes, 5 of each type (Table I).Table ICation-π chain motifπ∴+∴π1B8STrp (A67)Arg (A110)Ade (FAD 510)1BA1Tyr (15)Arg (272)Ade (ADP 486)1BG0Trp (221)Arg (124)Ade (ADP 400)1H8ETyr (A433)Gln (A432)Ade (ADP A600)1LVKPhe (129)Asn (127)Ade (MNT 999)+∴π∴+ s1C1YAsn (A116)Gua (GTP 170)Lys (A117)1EXMAsn (A136)Gua (GNP 406)Lys (A137)1HUQAsn (A134)Gua (GNP 200)Lys (A135)1HURAsn (A126)Gua (GDP A1)Lys (A127)+∴π∴+ o1QF5Lys (A18)Gua (GDP 1)Lys (A331) Open table in a new tab In the 5 occurrences of type π∴+∴πcation-π chains, a guanidinium or amide group of Arg, Asn, or Gln is sandwiched between an Ade base and an aromatic Trp, Tyr, or Phe side chain. The protein-ligand cation-π interaction is thus prolonged with a protein-protein cation-π interaction (Fig.1, c and d). The +∴π∴+ cation-π chains can be subdivided in two subsets, one in which the two side chains are at the same side of the aromatic ring (noted +∴π∴+ s) and one in which they are at opposite sides (+∴π∴+ o). There is only one occurrence of +∴π∴+ ochain, with the 5-member cycle of a Gua base sandwiched between two Lys side chains (Fig. 1 a), whereas there are four occurrences of+∴π∴+ s chains, where a Gua base interacts simultaneously with two consecutive residues along the polypeptide chain, an Asn and a Lys, both situated above the 5-member cycle (Fig.1 b). Note the simultaneous presence of one partial and one full positive charge above the aromatic cycle; the presence of two net positive charges would probably be unfavorable. Though the number of cation-π chains is too limited to allow firm conclusions, it is striking that π∴+∴π cation-π chains always involve Ade bases included in ADP-like ligands and that the +∴π∴+ chains always involve Gua bases contained in GDP-like ligands. Furthermore, the five proteins presenting the π∴+∴π motif present neither sequence nor structure similarity. In contradiction, the four proteins having the+∴π∴+s motif have unrelated sequences but are structurally similar; the structure superposition program SoFiSt (34Boutonnet N. Rooman M. Ochagavia M.-E. Richelle J. Wodak S. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 647-662Google Scholar) superposes about 130 residues with a root mean square deviation of heavy backbone atoms in the 1.0–2.7 Å range. Strikingly, in the resulting sequence alignments, the Asn-Lys pair forming the cation-π chain with the ligand is aligned in all four structures. Among the other residues that interact with the ligand, in particular through H-bonds, the pattern Gly-Lys-Thr-Thr, or its variant Gly-Lys-Ser-(Ser/Ala), is also well conserved and aligned, as well as an Asp residue at position A119 in 1C1Y numbering. There is thus a residue conservation in the immediate neighborhood of the ligand but not in the rest of the protein. In general, it can be argued that the presence of a specific cation-π chain motif could be due to a local sequence conservation (a global sequence similarity is excluded because of the requirement of less than 25% protein sequence identity, see “Materials and Methods”) and/or have a structural role. In particular, the conservation of the+∴π∴+ s motif could possibly reflect some sequence similarity left after (highly) divergent evolution or acquired during convergent evolution. Alternatively, this motif, as well as the π∴+∴π motif, could play a particular role in the recognition process, especially as the former is exclusively found in GDP/protein complexes and the other in ADP/protein complexes. However, it must be noted that not all ADP- or GDP-containing proteins exhibit these motifs. At this point, the exact role of these chain motifs is thus far from settled. The ligands are situated in protein pockets that are sometimes close to the protein surface and sometimes completely buried. They make thus extensive contacts with protein residues. The most frequent interactions linking protein and nucleobases are H-bonds; the large majority of the bases form 1 up to 4 H-bonds, with an average of 1.4, as detected by the HBPLUS program (35McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 777-793Google Scholar). Moreover, the bases are often involved in hydrophobic contacts or π-π stacking interactions. In the dataset of 188 protein-ligand complexes, we found with the help of the LigPlot program (36Wallace A.C. Laskowski R.A. Thornton J.M. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 127-1341Google Scholar) 122 contacts between the nucleobases and the hydrophobic Val, Ile, Leu, and Met side chains, and 86 between the nucleobases and the aromatic residues Tyr, Trp, and Phe, among which 49 correspond to π-π interactions. Hence, the nucleobase-amino acid cation-π interactions, with their 78 occurrences, appear to be more frequent than π-π stacking interactions in protein-ligand complexes, and its importance should thus not be overlooked. Furthermore, most of the amino acid side chains involved in cation-π interactions simultaneously make additional interactions with their local environment. These interactions vary among the complexes, and involve solvent molecules, other amino acid side chains or other ligand moieties adjacent to the purine or pyrimidine ring. This observation demonstrates an important difference between protein-ligand and protein-DNA cation-π interactions. Indeed, the latter occur almost systematically with an H-bond, generally double, that links the guanidinium, amide, or ammonium group with the next base along the DNA stack, hence forming a recurrent motif with typical stair shape (11Rooman M. Liévin J. Buisine E. Wintjens R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 67-76Google Scholar). This concomitant occurrence has sometimes been used to shed doubt on the reality on cation-π interactions, suspected to result only"

Results from these experiments indicated that each of the 2 molecules of discoidal bound apoA-I exists in multiple conformations and support the concept of a “variable registry” rather than a “fixed helix-helix registry.” Additionally, discoidal rHDL were transformed in vitro to core-containing particles by incubation with lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. Compositional analysis showed that core-containing particles contained 11% less phospholipid and 633% more cholesterol ester and a total of 3 apoA-I molecules per particle.

Despite the extensive associative data, the mechanisms explaining how HDL apoA-I accomplishes its anti-atherogenic role remain debatable. One of the most popular hypotheses is that apoA-I HDL directs “reverse cholesterol transport” involving the organization of phospholipid, and cholesterol, the activation of LCAT1 and its conversion of cholesterol to cholesterol ester, which is then delivered to SR-B1 for elimination by the liver (1De la Llera-Moya M.

Krieger M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Another hypothesis suggests that HDL provides a variety of antioxidant and anti-inflammatory factors to the artery wall, thus, aiding in the stabilization of the “susceptible plaque” to potential rupture and thrombosis (3Libby P. Am. J. Cardiol. 2001; 88: 3N-8NPubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 4Navab M. Van Lenten B.J. Reddy S.T. Fogelman A.M. Circulation. 2001; 104: 2386-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both mechanisms likely provide the basis for the potent anti-atherogenic role for HDL, whereas they also emphasize the common feature, apoA-I, as the unique molecule driving both mechanisms.Since the publication of the x-ray crystal structure of lipid-free Δ43 apoA-I (5Borhani D.W.

The term belt was coined to specify the orientation of the apoprotein helices lying perpendicular to the phospholipid acyl chains, as distinguished from the picket fence where the acyl chains lie parallel to the protein helices (9Segrest J.P.

Although the majority of studies now support the belt conformation describing lipid-bound apoA-I, it is not clear whether disc bound apoA-I favors intramolecular interactions such as in a “hairpin” configuration (13Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 14Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Engler J.A. Brouillette C.G.

Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Although these two types of belt conformation are not easily distinguished by most techniques, they have very different consequences regarding the helix registry of lipid-bound molecules of apoA-I.Recently, two studies using quantitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), measured the molecular distance between fluorescent probes attached to lipid-bound apoA-I (6Li H.H.

Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The earlier study from our laboratory, Li et al. (6Li H.H. Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), measured the distance at one site between two apoA-I molecules, whereas a later study by Tricerriet al. (13Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) measured the distance between acceptor and donor probes placed at three different sites. Remarkably, both studies reported a similar 20–36% quenching from steady state measurements for all probe combinations, whereas a 50 or 75% predicted quenching was expected based on the ratio of acceptor to donor probe. Therefore, both studies concluded that the data demonstrating fluorescence quenching were consistent with the belt conformation and excluded the picket fence conformation.However, each study interpreted the “missing” quenching differently. Tricerri et al. (13Tricerri M.A. Behling Agree A.K. Sanchez S.A. Bronski J. Jonas A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5065-5074Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the only model consistent with all the data including the missing fluorescence quenching was the alternative belt conformation, termed a hairpin that was hypothesized to exist in an equal ratio of head to head and head to tail. Li et al. (6Li H.H. Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were not able to distinguish between an extended versus hairpin belt arrangement, and hypothesized that the missing fluorescence was because of nonrandom distribution of acceptor-labeled apoA-I molecules. Therefore, neither approach conclusively established the exact conformation of lipid-bound apoA-I nor do they explain the cause of the missing fluorescence quenching.Therefore, to more clearly distinguish between alternative conformations of lipid-bound apoA-I and to address the issue of helix registry we have used FRET analysis to measure the distance between fluorescent probe pairs within repeats 5 and 5, repeats 5 and 6, and repeats 6 and 6. We have also initiated studies to determine what conformational changes apoA-I undergoes as it adapts from a discoidal to a spherical surface.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESChemicals used were reagent grade and the highest purity commercially available.

Briefly, mutant apoA-I was reacted in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 50 μm dithiothreitol with a 5-fold molar excess of 5-IAF or 5-TMRIA over total thiols and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Probe-labeled apoA-I was separated from free probe using a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated in 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The fractions containing 5-IAF-labeled or 5-TMRIA-labeled apoA-I were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.4, 3 μm EDTA, and 15 μm sodium azide. Traces of the more hydrophobic free probe were found in the 5-TMRIA-labeled apoA-I, these preparations were adjusted to 6 m guanidine hydrochloride and applied to a Sephadex G-25 column pre-equilibrated with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4.

Immediately before an experiment 1 mg of DSP was dissolved in 1000 μl of Me2SO for a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. The dissolved DSP was added to the reaction mixture for a 30 DSP to 1 apoA-I molar ratio. After the addition, the tube was capped, inverted several times to mix, and immediately placed at 37 °C for 5 min. Following the reaction, tubes were iced, and 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was added to a 0.03m final concentration to stop the reaction. Aliquots containing 6 μg of protein were analyzed on nonreducing SDS-PAGE.Isolation and Purification of LDL and LCATLow density lipoproteins (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) used in these studies were from African green monkey plasma that had been spun atd < 1.225 then run over 2 Superose-6 columns as described (16Rudel L.L. Haines J.L. Sawyer J.K. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 10: 1873-1883Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The fractions containing the LDL fractions were pooled and used directly.Recombinant human His-tagged LCAT (His-LCAT) was isolated from stably transfected CHO cell medium as previously described (17Chisholm J.W.

LCAT-containing fractions were identified by theirA 280 and by the measurement of their enzymatic activity.

Briefly, a final volume of 1 ml contained the following components: 0.1 mg of rHDL protein, 0.1 mg of LDL protein, 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 200 μl of human His-LCAT (equivalent to 40 μg of protein) and a final concentration of 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 1.5 μm sodium azide, 0.25 μm EDTA. The reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a shaking water bath. In controls, only the addition of purified His-LCAT was omitted. After incubation, the samples were adjusted to d = 1.063 g/ml and LDL was separated by ultracentrifugation using a Ti 70.1 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The samples were spun for 24 h at 50,000 rpm at 15 °C. Following the spin, the bottom fraction was taken and the density was adjusted tod = 1.225 g/ml. The samples were then centrifuged again in a Ti 70.1 rotor for 24 h at 50,000 rpm at 15 °C. The top 3.0 ml were collected, dialyzed against 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4, 1.5 mm sodium azide, 0.3 mm EDTA, and concentrated using an ultrafree-15 centrifuge filter unit.Size and Composition Determination on Discoidal and Core-containing rHDLThe final molar phospholipid, cholesterol, and protein compositions were determined as previously described (6Li H.H.

The size distribution and purity of DPPC rHDL containing 5-IAF and 5-TMRIA probe-labeled apoA-I containing rHDL were determined by 4–30% nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. After separation the gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G and then scanned using a ChemiImagerTM5500 (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Particle size was determined by comparison to proteins of known Stokes diameter as described previously (6Li H.H. Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol.

Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Briefly, ∼6–12 μg of rHDL protein was adjusted to 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, in a 1-ml final volume. Fluorescence analysis was conducted with excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 and 550 nm, and 530 and 580 nm, for donor and acceptor probes, respectively. All values represent the mean ± S.D. at least two to four independent preparations of rHDL.Fluorescence lifetimes were measured by the phase and modulation technique using an ISS K2 multifrequency fluorometer as described previously (6Li H.H. Lyles D.S. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37048-37054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), except the data were fit to a Gaussian distribution of lifetimes rather than to discrete exponentials. In this analysis, the data were fit to a distribution of intensities, I(τ), by fitting two parameters, a peak lifetime, t 0, and a distribution width, w. The distribution of intensities is described as the following. I(τ)=Exp(−(τ−τ0)2/2w2)Equation 1 If each donor molecule fluoresces independently of other donor molecules, the contribution of each component to the total intensity is inversely proportional to its lifetime. Therefore, I(τ) is more heavily weighted toward the longer lifetime components. To correct for this weighting, the distribution of donor molecules, G(τ), was approximated by Equation 2 and was converted to a fractional distribution, g(τ), by Equation 3. G(τ)=I(τ)/τEquation 2 g(τ)=G(τ)/∫G(τ)dτEquation 3 These equations are an approximation because G(τ) ≫ 1 fort ≪ 1. Because t 0 was ∼4 ns andw was ∼0.5– 1.5 ns, the distributions were well described by calculating G(τ) for 0.2 ns < t < 10 ns. The integrated distribution ∫G(τ)dt was estimated by numerical integration as ΣG(τ)Δτ for 0.2 ns < τ < 10 ns and Δτ = 0.2 ns. The average lifetime, τAV, was calculated as the following. τAV=∫τ*G(τ)dτ/∫G(τ)dτ=∫I(τ)dτ/∫G(τ)dτEquation 4 Quenching of donor probes by acceptor probes was calculated as [τAV(donor + acceptor)/τAV(donor alone)] × 100%.Data AnalysisData are presented as the mean ± S.D. or S.E., where noted. The Statview 5.0.1 program was used to analyze data using paired t tests and ANOVA.RESULTSIn these studies the lipid-bound conformation of apoA-I was studied using FRET, allowing the distance to be measured between acceptor and donor fluorescent probes. Fluorescent probes were attached to cysteine residues substituted at specific locations within apoA-I repeat 5(Q132C) and repeat 6(A154C) (15Li H.H. Thomas M.J. Pan W. Alexander E. Samuel M. Sorci-Thomas M.G. J. Lipid Res. 2001; 42: 2084-2091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution sites were selected based on Edmunson helical wheel diagrams to identify noncharged residues located on the negatively charged or polar face of the α-helical 22-mer repeat under examination. Fluorescein (donor) or rhodamine (acceptor) probes were attached to apoA-I and then used in the preparation of DPPC rHDL discoidal complexes using a 3:1 molar ratio of acceptor to donor-labeled apoA-I, as previously described (6Li H.H.

Some of the probe-labeled DPPC rHDL were used for thein vitro conversion to core containing spherical particles by incubation with LDL and LCAT. Following incubation for 2 h at 37 °C with LDL and LCAT, all HDL particles were reisolated by sequential ultracentrifugation and then characterized by size and composition. Fig. 1 shows the particle size of rHDL, rHDL incubated with LDL, and rHDL incubated with LDL and LCAT. The Coomassie Blue-stained nondenaturing 4–30% gradient gel shows the minimal changes in size accompanying the different treatments, starting at rHDL (lane 1), rHDL incubated with an equal protein mass of LDL for 2 h at 37 °C (lane 2), and rHDL + LDL and 40 μg of human His-LCAT (lane 3). Incubation of rHDL with LDL alone caused a slight shift in the rHDL size to a smaller particle, which was reversed when the rHDL was incubated with LDL and LCAT.To determine whether rHDL containing different fluorescent probe combinations affected the size of the starting rHDL or the core-containing particles generated, additional rHDL preparations were examined. Shown in Fig. 1 B, various preparations of DPPC rHDL containing probe-labeled apoA-I were incubated with an equal protein mass of LDL and ±40 μg of His-LCAT for 2 h at 37 °C and then purified by sequential ultracentrifugation. Lane 1shows donor-labeled Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL. Lane 2 shows donor-labeled Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL + LCAT.Lane 3 shows donor- and acceptor-labeled Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL. Lane 4 shows the donor and acceptor Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL + LCAT. Lane 5 shows acceptor-labeled Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL. Lane 6 shows the acceptor-labeled Q132C apoA-I rHDL incubated with LDL and LCAT. Treatment of rHDL with LDL resulted in a slight but reproducible reduction in size, regardless of the fluorescent probe attached. The shift in size was reversed when rHDL were incubated with LDL and LCAT, again regardless of the probe attachment site.The mean particle size was determined for the various probe pair combinations and are shown in Fig. 1, panel C, and TableI. The mean particle diameter for discoidal rHDL, rHDL + LDL, and rHDL + LDL + LCAT were, 9.55 + 0.01, 9.33 + 0.03, and 9.64 + 0.01 nm (mean ± S.E. of four to six independent measurements). The changes in size and homogeneity after incubation with LDL and with LDL + LCAT are similar to those previously reported by other investigators (18Jonas A. Wald J.H. Toohill"
https://openalex.org/W2317508718,"The three human TACC genes encode a family of proteins that are suspected to play a role in carcinogenesis. Their function is not precisely known; a Xenopus TACC protein called Maskin is involved in translational control, while the Drosophila D-TACC associates with microtubules and centrosomes. We have characterized the human TACC1 gene and its products. The TACC1 gene is located in region p12 of chromosome 8; its mRNA is ubiquitously expressed and encodes a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 125 kDa, which is cytoplasmic and mainly perinuclear. We show that TACC1 mRNA gene expression is down-regulated in various types of tumors. Using immunohistochemistry of tumor tissue-microarrays and sections, we confirm that the level of TACC1 protein is down-regulated in breast cancer. Finally, using the two-hybrid screen in yeast, GST pull-downs and co-immunoprecipitations, we identified two potential binding partners for TACC1, LSM7 and SmG. They constitute a conserved subfamily of Sm-like small proteins that associate with U6 snRNPs and play a role in several aspects of mRNA processing. We speculate that down-regulation of TACC1 may alter the control of mRNA homeostasis in polarized cells and participates in the oncogenic processes."
https://openalex.org/W2080989962,"The two-component regulatory system DcuSR ofEscherichia coli controls the expression of genes of C4-dicarboxylate metabolism in response to extracellular C4- dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate. DcuS is a membrane-integral sensor kinase, and the sensory and kinase domains are located on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic membrane. The intact DcuS protein (His6-DcuS) was overproduced and isolated in detergent containing buffer. His6-DcuS was reconstituted into liposomes made from E. coli phospholipids. Reconstituted His6-DcuS catalyzed, in contrast to the detergent-solubilized sensor, autophosphorylation by [γ-33P]ATP with an approximate K Dof 0.16 mm for ATP. Up to 7% of the reconstituted DcuS was phosphorylated. Phosphorylation was stimulated up to 5.9-fold by C4-dicarboxylates, but not by other carboxylates. The phosphoryl group of DcuS was rapidly transferred to the response regulator DcuR. Upon phosphorylation, DcuR bound specifically to dcuB promoter DNA. The reconstituted DcuSR system therefore represents a defined in vitro system, which is capable of the complete transmembrane signal transduction by the DcuSR two-component system from the stimulus (fumarate) to the DNA, including signal transfer across the phospholipid membrane. The two-component regulatory system DcuSR ofEscherichia coli controls the expression of genes of C4-dicarboxylate metabolism in response to extracellular C4- dicarboxylates such as fumarate or succinate. DcuS is a membrane-integral sensor kinase, and the sensory and kinase domains are located on opposite sides of the cytoplasmic membrane. The intact DcuS protein (His6-DcuS) was overproduced and isolated in detergent containing buffer. His6-DcuS was reconstituted into liposomes made from E. coli phospholipids.

For sensing of environmental parameters most frequently two-component sensor-regulator systems are used by the bacteria. The two-component systems are composed of sensory histidine (His) protein kinases and of response regulator proteins (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar, 2Aizawa S.I. Harwood R.J. Kadner J. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 1459-1471Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The protein kinases typically are located in the cytoplasmic membrane and comprise of a N-terminal sensory and a conserved C-terminal transmitter domain. The transmitter domain contains a kinase and a His residue as the site for phosphorylation. After autophosphorylation of the His residue, the phosphoryl group is transmitted to the response regulator. Typically, the N-terminal sensory domain is located at the periplasmic aspect of the membrane, whereas the kinase domain is located on the opposite cytoplasmic side of the membrane. Information on the partial reactions like stimulus perception, kinase activity, and phosphoryl transfer to the response regulator and the function of individual domains were gained mainly by studies with soluble His protein kinases like CheA or NtrB or, in the case of membranous kinases, with solubilized domains of the protein obtained by genetic truncation. In this way autophosphorylation, transphosphorylation between the subunits of the homooligomeric kinase domains, and phosphoryl transfer to the response regulators has been studied (Refs. 3Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S.

Similarly, binding of citrate to the periplasmic domain of the citrate sensor CitA, which binds citrate with high affinity, has been carefully characterized after overproduction of the solubilized domain (12Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister L. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 13Kaspar S. Bott M. Arch. Microbiol. 2002; 177: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Due to lack of suitable experimental systems for studies in membranes, His protein kinases with transmembrane arrangement of the sensory and kinase domains have not been studied in detail in vitro. The most intriguing and characteristic property of this class of His protein kinases is signal transduction across the cytoplasmic membrane and the control of kinase activity by stimulus binding in the periplasm. Therefore a system suitable for biochemical studies on sensors of this type in the membrane capable of all functions, in particular control of the kinase by stimulus binding would be required for studies on signal transfer. In Escherichia coli the DcuSR two component system (C4-dicarboxylateuptake) is responsible for the detection of C4-dicarboxylates in the medium (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J.

DcuSR stimulates the expression of genes involved in C4-dicarboxylate metabolism, including dcuBencoding the C4-dicarboxylate carrier DcuB of fumarate respiration (18Six S. Andrews S.C. Unden G.

The sensor DcuS is a member of the CitA family of His protein kinases (15Golby P. Davies S. Kelly J.R. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Janausch I.G. Zientz E. Tran Q.H. Kröger A. Unden G. Biochim. Biophys.

For regulation by DcuS, no uptake of the C4-dicarboxylates into the cells is required (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Golby P. Davies S. Kelly J.R. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the C4-dicarboxylates presumably occurs by a periplasmic domain close to the N-terminal domain, which is framed by two transmembrane helices. This periplasmic domain is homologous to the citrate binding domain of CitA, which binds citrate with high affinity (12Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister L. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The kinase domain is located in the cytoplasm at the C-terminal end of the protein and separated by a putative further sensory (PAS or “linker”) domain of unknown function from the second transmembrane helix (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Golby P. Davies S. Kelly J.R. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For understanding of DcuS function as a transmembranous sensor and signal transducing protein, DcuS was solubilized in detergent, isolated, and reconstituted functionally in liposomes. By this an in vitro system for studies on DcuS function was established, which allows studies on stimulus perception and transmembrane signal transfer to the kinase domain and the complete signal transduction pathway to the DNA. Such a system seems to be a prerequisite for studies extending beyond the function of single domains, in particular of control of kinase activity by extracellular stimuli and transmembrane signaling. Standard molecular genetic methods were performed according to Sambrook et al. (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or as recommended by suppliers. Genomic DNA was isolated according to Chen and Kuo (24Chen W. Kuo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 2260Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), plasmids by boiling lysis (25Holmes D.S. Quigley M. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 193Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) or using kits (Qiagen, Hilden). PCR products were purified with the Qiaquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen). DNA from agarose gels was extracted with the Qiaquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen). E. coli strains were transformed after pretreatment with RbCl (26Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar, 27Chung C.T. Niemela S.L. Miller R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2172-2175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar, 28Inoue H. Nojima H. Okayama H. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). For overexpression of dcuS, the gene was amplified by the hot start method with oligonucleotide primers DcuS-N (5′-CACACAAGGAAGCATATGAGACATTC) and DcuS-C (5′-ATTAAAAGCTTGATCATCTGTTCGAC) from E. coli AN387 (29Tran Q.H. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) genomic DNA. The PCR fragment was cloned via the NdeI and HindIII sites of the oligonucleotide into pET28a behind the inducible T7 promoter (Novagen). The resulting construct (pMW151) codes for complete DcuS, including Met (1Parkinson J.S. Kofoid E.C. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 71-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar) and carries an N-terminal His6-tag and a thrombin cleavage site. For overproduction of DcuR, the dcuR gene was cloned into the NdeI and HindIII sites of pET28a after amplification of the gene from E. coli AN387 DNA by PCR with primers pdcuR-Nde-22 (5′-GAGGTCGAACATATGATCAATG) and pdcuR-Hind-22 (5′-TAACCAGCGAAGCTTTATTGGC). The resulting plasmid pMW180 codes for the complete dcuR gene, the thrombin site, and the His6-tag. For isolation of DcuS, E. coli BL21DE3pMW151 was grown in 0.8 liter of LB medium (30Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar) at 30 °C under aerobic conditions to OD578 = 0.5 and then induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)1 for 3 h (OD578 ∼ 1.3). Where appropriate, antibiotics were included. Before and after induction, 1 ml of the bacterial culture was dissolved in SDS loading buffer and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The cells were harvested, washed, and resuspended in buffer 1 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, and 10 mm MgCl2). The bacteria were broken by three passages through the French press, and after removal of debris (9000 × g), the membrane fraction was pelleted by centrifugation (200,000 × g for 65 min). All further steps were performed at 4 °C. The membranes were washed twice (1 mm Tris/HCl, 3 mm EDTA at pH 7.7) and homogenized (1.5 mg/ml) in buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol). The membrane fraction was mixed with the zwitterionic detergents Empigen BB (30%, Calbiochem) or lauryldimethylamine N-oxide (LDAO, Fluka) at a final concentration of 2% (w/v) and gently stirred for 30 min in an ice bath (32Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). After centrifugation (50 min at 300,000 × g) the supernatant was run by gravity through a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose column (3 ml, Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer 2 (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.7, 10% glycerol, 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 0.04% dodecyl maltoside). The column was rinsed with 40 ml of buffer 2, and bound protein was eluted with 3 ml of buffer 3 (buffer 2 with 100 mm imidazole). For the isolation of DcuR, E. coli BL21DE3pMW180 was grown in 0.8 liter of LB medium, induced, and the cells were broken by the French press as described for E. coli BL21DE3pMW151. After the removal of debris and of the membranes by centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-NTA column (3 ml) equilibrated with buffer 4 (50 mm NaK-phosphate at pH 7, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole). After washing with 30 ml of buffer 5 (buffer 4 with 20 mm imidazole), the His6-DcuR protein was eluted with 30 ml of buffer 3 with 500 mm NaCl, 500 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was adjusted to 40% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. 50 mg of E. coli phospholipids (polar lipid extract, 20 mg/ml in chloroform, Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) were evaporated and dissolved in 5 ml K+-phosphate buffer (20 mm) containing 80 mgN-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside similar to a procedure by Jung et al. (32Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The solution was dialyzed overnight against 3 × 1 liter buffer (20 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 7.5). The resulting liposome suspension was frozen for three cycles in liquid N2 and thawed slowly at 20 °C. The liposomes were destabilazed by addition of dodecylmaltoside (0.58% w/v) or Triton X-100 (0.5% w/v). Isolated His6-DcuS in elution buffer was added at a phospholipid:protein ratio > 20:1 (mg/mg) and stirred gently for 10 min at 20 °C. For every mg of Triton X-100 and dodecyl maltoside, 10 and 15 mg degassed Bio-Beads pretreated as described by Holloway (33Holloway P.W. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 53: 304-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (641) Google Scholar) were added to remove detergent. The suspension was incubated overnight at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with fresh Bio-Beads for 1 h at 20 °C. The supernatant was removed with a pipette, frozen in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. 80 μl of the proteoliposome suspension were adjusted to 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 mm fumarate and frozen rapidly in liquid N2 and slowly thawed at 20 °C for three cycles (34Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). After the final thawing, the proteoliposomes were kept for 1 h at 20 °C. Then 2.5 μl of [γ-33P]ATP (110 TBq/mmol) were added at final concentrations of 0.1–10,000 μm ATP. Where indicated, isolated DcuR (4 μg/μg of DcuS) was mixed with the phosphorylation assay. At the time indicated, 10 μl were withdrawn, mixed with 10 μl SDS loading buffer, and 2 μg of DcuS per lane was subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis the gels were exposed to an imaging plate (Fuji BAS-MP2040) to determine the radioactive bands in a phosphorimager (Fuji BAS 1500). For quantitative measurement of the radioactivity, the gels were stained for protein with Coomassie Blue. The protein bands were excised and incubated for 12 h at 46 °C in capped scintillation vials with small volumes (200 μl) of 30% H2O2. The solution with the dissolved bands was mixed with 4.5 ml of scintillation mixture (Rotiscint Ecoplus) and counted for radioactivity (Beckman LS6000 SC). From the protein, the radioactivity, and the specific radioactivity, the amount of phosphate per protein (mol of Pi/mol of DcuS) was calculated. DcuS and DcuR are minor proteins in E. coli, therefore the dcuSand dcuR genes were cloned separately in expression vectors for overproduction of DcuS and DcuR as recombinant proteins with N-terminal His6 extensions (Fig.1). The dcuS expression strain overproduced a protein of M r 61,000, which is close to the predicted mass of 62,637 Da of His6-DcuS. Upon cell fractionation, the M r 61,000 protein was found in the non-soluble cell fraction. From the membrane fraction the proteins were extracted with buffers containing the detergents LDAO or Empigen BB. Upon fractionation by centrifugation, most of theM r 61,000 protein was found in the soluble fraction. The solubilized proteins were applied to a Ni2+-NTA column, and LDAO or Empigen BB were replaced by rinsing with buffer containing dodecyl maltoside as the detergent. TheM r 61,000 protein was eluted specifically with imidazole. The recombinant response regulator His6-DcuR was present mostly in the supernatant of the cell homogenate after overexpression and fractionation (Fig. 1). His6-DcuR was isolated in pure form using a Ni2+-NTA column. A considerable part of the protein was lost in the particulate cell fraction, presumably in the form of inclusion bodies. From 100 mg of cell protein about 2 mg of His6-DcuS or 15 mg of His6-DcuR were obtained. The solubilized DcuS protein was incorporated into liposomes prepared fromE. coli phospholipids by dialysis. The liposomes were incubated with low amounts of Triton X-100 or dodecyl maltoside to achieve “onset solubilization” (34Rigaud J.L. Pitard B. Levy D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 223-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) and mixed with isolated His6-DcuS in dodecyl maltoside. The detergent was removed from the mixture by treatment with Bio-Beads, resulting in the insertion of DcuS in the liposomes and the formation of proteoliposomes. The proteoliposomes were freeze-thawed to increase their size and to enable access of the stimulus (fumarate or succinate) to the intraliposomal space. The histidine kinase activity of DcuS was measured as the autophosphorylation of DcuS in the presence of [γ-33P]ATP. After incubation, the proteoliposomes were dissolved in SDS and subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis. The phosphorylation of DcuS was detected by autoradiography using a phosphorimager (Fig. 2). The labeling of the reconstituted DcuS increased with time of incubation. Isolated DcuS protein in detergent, however, was not labeled by [γ-33P]ATP under the same conditions. Even with 10 times the amount of solubilized DcuS, no labeling was detected (Fig.2). In a quantitative kinetic analysis, the phosphorylation of reconstituted DcuS increased with time (Fig. 3) and approached a maximum after 45 min with a t 0.5 value of about 13 min. Quantitative evaluation of phosphorylation by scintillation counting of the protein bands after excision and digestion showed that up to 7% of DcuS became phosphorylated. Presumably, the other portion of DcuS was not functional. When the DcuS-proteoliposomes were sonicated after addition of the ATP, about the same rate and final extent of phosphorylation of DcuS was obtained (not shown). Therefore the site of DcuS phosphorylation seems to be accessible to ATP under the experimental conditions. Since ATP was added after formation of the proteoliposomes, the kinase domain seems to be accessible from the outside suggesting an inside-out orientation of DcuS. The osmosensor KdpD, which was reconstituted by a similar procedure, was found in an unidirectional inside-out orientation in the liposomes (32Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the result could indicate that the proteoliposomes are not closed and permit the ATP to access the internal space. The kinetics of DcuS phosphorylation was followed for different ATP concentrations ranging from 10 to 10,000 μm in the phosphorylation buffer (Fig. 4). The experiments were performed similar to that from Fig. 3, and the rates were calculated after 15 min of reaction. Plotting the inverse rate of phosphorylation (1/v) versus the inverse concentration of ATP (1/[ATP]) gave a nearly linear relation (not shown). From the Lineweaver-Burk plot a K m for ATP of 0.16 mm can be estimated. In vivo, C4-dicarboxylates serve as stimuli of DcuS/DcuR-dependent gene expression (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Golby P. Davies S. Kelly J.R. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J.

Acta. 2002; 1553: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The stimulation of DcuS autophosphorylation by C4-dicarboxylates was tested in the proteoliposomes (Fig.5 and TableI). The proteoliposomes were prepared without or with addition of succinate or fumarate during the freeze-thaw step to enable the effectors to gain access to the internal space of the liposomes. Then the phosphorylation of DcuS was measured after incubation with [γ-33P]ATP, separation of the proteins by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorimager analysis (Fig. 5). The phosphorylation of DcuS was significantly increased in the presence of fumarate or succinate.Table IEffect of carboxylates on autophosphorylation of DcuS reconstituted in proteoliposomes and on the expression of dcuB′-′ lacZ in vivoStimulus (20 mm)Phosphorylation of DcuSExpression of dcuB′-′ lacZ%Miller unitsNone17–3048Fumarate=100573Succinate51437ButyrateND18Acetate2065His6-DcuS proteoliposomes in the presence of the carboxylates (20 mm) were incubated with 100 nm[γ-33P]ATP. After 15 min the proteoliposomes were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity and phosphate content were determined using the phosphorimager and scintillation counting. The radioactivity in the fumarate-stimulated samples was taken as 100% (70 mmol of phosphate/mol of DcuS). The expression of dcuB′-′ lacZ was measured in strain IMW260pMW181 after growth in the presence of the corresponding stimuli (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab His6-DcuS proteoliposomes in the presence of the carboxylates (20 mm) were incubated with 100 nm[γ-33P]ATP. After 15 min the proteoliposomes were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The radioactivity and phosphate content were determined using the phosphorimager and scintillation counting. The radioactivity in the fumarate-stimulated samples was taken as 100% (70 mmol of phosphate/mol of DcuS). The expression of dcuB′-′ lacZ was measured in strain IMW260pMW181 after growth in the presence of the corresponding stimuli (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ND, not determined. The stimulation of DcuS phosphorylation by mono- and dicarboxylates was quantified by the phosphorimager and is compared in Table I to the effect of the carboxylates on dcuB expression, using adcuB′-′lacZ reporter gene fusion (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fumarate showed the highest stimulation of DcuS phosphorylation by factors up to 5.9, followed by succinate. Monocarboxylates like acetate had no positive, or even an inhibitory, effect on phosphorylation. Fumarate and succinate caused the highest stimulation of dcuB expression (Table I), whereas monocarboxylates did not stimulate (14Zientz E. Bongaerts J. Unden G. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5421-5425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Golby P. Davies S. Kelly J.R. Guest J.R. Andrews S.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 1238-1248Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus DcuS phosphorylation and DcuS-dependent regulation in principle had similar specificities for the carboxylates. Stimulation of dcuB expression, however, was generally higher than the increase in DcuS phosphorylation as would be expected due to an amplification of the stimulus by the sensor/regulator. As a consequence, the response of the target (dcuB expression) to the stimulus would be stronger than that of the sensor/regulator (DcuS phosphorylation). The phosphoryl transfer from DcuS-P to the response regulator DcuR was studied in the in vitro system. DcuS-proteoliposomes were incubated in the presence of fumarate with [γ-33P]ATP (Fig.6), and the kinetics of DcuS phosphorylation was similar to that shown in Fig. 3. When isolated DcuR protein was added, the radioactivity was rapidly and to a great extent (98% dephosphorylation of DcuS after 2 min) transferred from DcuS to DcuR. After 1 min, only about 50% of the radioactivity lost from DcuS was found in DcuR. The radioactivity found in DcuR further decreased rapidly with increasing time, indicating that DcuR-P was not stable (Fig. 6, B and C). Based on a quantitative evaluation using the phosphorimager and calibration by scintillation counting, the rates of DcuS phosphorylation and of desphosphorylation can be estimated from the gradient of the reaction graph in Fig. 6 C. The phosphoryl transfer occurred with rates exceeding those of DcuS phosphorylation by a factor of 40 or more. The DNA binding of phosphorylated DcuR was tested in a gel retardation assay (Fig.7). DcuR was phosphorylated by incubation with ATP and DcuS-proteoliposomes (Fig. 7 A) or for control by incubation with acetyl phosphate (Fig. 7 B). Phosphorylated DcuR was then incubated with radioactively labeled DNA containing the dcuB promoter, and the mixture was subjected to native DNA gel electrophoresis. When DcuR was phosphorylated with acetylphosphate (Fig. 7 B), low amounts (0.7 μm) of DcuR-phosphate (DcuR-P) caused disappearance of the band of free DNA. In parallel a band of retarded DNA turned up with decreased mobility, which presumably represents the DNA·DcuR-P complex. The retardation was not observed for non-phosphorylated DcuR (Fig. 7 C) or for DNA derived from promoters not regulated by DcuSR (not shown). A detailed analysis of DcuR-P at target promoters showed that binding is specific and found only at target promoters, which are regulated by DcuR in vivo. 2I. Garcia-Moreno and G. Unden, unpublished data. When DcuR was phosphorylated by DcuS-proteoliposomes (Fig.7 A), the DNA band corresponding to free DNA disappeared at concentrations of DcuR-P very similar to those of the experiment of Fig. 7 B, when DcuR was phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate. In a control experiment without ATP or DcuR, the band of free DNA did not disappear (not shown). The retarded DNA-protein complex, however, was not able to migrate into the gel and remained in the pockets of the gel (Fig. 7 A). This suggests that the dcuBpromoter DNA was bound specifically by phosphorylated DcuR and that a complex consisting of DcuS, DcuR-P, and DNA was formed, which was too large to migrate into the gel. Complexes consisting of sensors and response regulators have been described earlier (12Kaspar S. Perozzo R. Reinelt S. Meyer M. Pfister L. Scapozza L. Bott M. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 858-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 35Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Overall, DcuR phosphorylated via reconstituted DcuS, and ATP seems to be capable of specific binding to dcuB promoter DNA similar to DcuR phosphorylated by acetyl phosphate. DcuS has been isolated and reconstituted functionally in liposomes with inside-out orientation, i.e. the stimulus binding domain within and the kinase domain outside the liposome (Fig.8). This can be concluded from the accessibility of ATP to the kinase without disintegration of the liposomes and of a unique protease site. 3H. Kneuper and G. Unden, unpublished data. Reconstituted DcuS is capable of C4-dicarboxylate-sensitive autophosphorylation and of phosphoryl transfer to DcuR, which is then able to bind to promoter DNA. Thus a functional in vitro system for complete signal transduction by DcuS/DcuR from the stimulus fumarate to DNA binding is available. Such a system will be important for understanding the overall function of two-component sensors with transmembrane arrangement of sensory and transmitter domains (5Schröder I. Wolin C.D. Cavicchioli R. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 4985-4992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Bird T.H., Du, S. Bauer C.E. J. Biol.

In particular, such a system can be used to study signal transduction and transmembrane signaling, which depends on the membrane intrinsic portions of the protein linking the periplasmic sensory and the cytoplasmic kinase domains. There is only a small number of membrane intrinsic histidine kinases that have been studied in a functional in vitro system. Detailed studies have been performed with the turgor and osmolality sensors KdpD and EnvZ of E. coli(32Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Jung K. Hamann K. Revermann A. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3800-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). KdpD controls the intracellular K+concentration by transcriptional regulation of the kdpFABCoperon, which encodes the high affinity K+-translocating Kdp ATPase. The stimulus of KdpD is supposed to be the cytoplasmic K+ concentration or a parameter related to it, like changes in the cytoplasmic ATP levels, which are supposed to reflect turgor changes (39Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 40Heermann R. Altendorf K. Jung K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17080-17085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). KdpD requires membrane insertion for function like DcuS. KdpD contains (in addition to the C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase) a large cytoplasmic N-terminal domain, which is essential for sensing. Signal transfer from the sensory to the kinase domain of KdpD presumably requires direct interaction of the cytoplasmic sensor and kinase domains and does not depend on transmembrane signaling in contrast to DcuS. EnvZ contains a distinct periplasmic domain, but it is not clear whether this domain is involved in stimulus perception. Another type of membranous histidine protein kinases is exemplified by the O2-sensor FixL of Sinorhizobium (formerRhizobium) meliloti. In FixL, the membrane portion is not essential for sensing or signal transfer and might be required mainly for anchoring the protein to the membrane. The short N-terminal anchor domain of FixL is followed by sensory and kinase domains, which are both located in the cytoplasm. FixL obviously senses O2 after its diffusion into the cell, and signal transfer to the kinase domain does not involve transmembrane processes. After genetic deletion of the membrane anchor, the sensor and kinase domains form one coherent soluble protein, which has been used for studies on O2 binding and control of kinase function by O2(4Lois A.F. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 1103-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 35Tuckerman J.R. Gonzalez G. Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 308: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Isolated DcuS is active only after reconstitution into liposomes. Since autophosphorylation requires transphosphorylation between the monomers of dimeric or oligomeric His protein kinases (36Stock J.B. Surette M.G. Levit M. Park P. Hoch J.A. Silhavy T.J. Two-Component Signal Transduction. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 25-51Google Scholar), it is feasible that this oligomeric state is lost in detergent and regained upon reconstitution. 7% of the reconstituted DcuS were phosphorylated in the proteoliposomes, which could be due to insufficient transphosphorylation or oligomerization. For other reconstituted membranous sensors the portion of functionally reconstituted sensor kinase has not been quantified and might be even lower. Reconstituted DcuS responded to the presence of C4-dicarboxylates with an up to 5.9-fold stimulation of autophosphorylation. Thus stimulus binding might control DcuS function at the kinase level; however, other activities like phosphoryl transfer or phosphatase might be affected in addition. For reconstituted DcuS the K m for ATP was determined (0.16 mm). In aerobically and anaerobically grown E. coli the cellular ATP levels (> 3 μmol ATP/g of dry cells, corresponding to 3 mm intracellular ATP) (29Tran Q.H. Unden G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 538-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) significantly exceed this value. Therefore ATP would be present at saturating concentrations for DcuS phosphorylation during growth by fumarate respiration where DcuSR has its main function, and most other conditions, suggesting that intracellular ATP concentrations do not supply a regulatory signal. Availability of an in vitro system for DcuSR should enable future studies on the complete signal transduction pathway and a more detailed understanding of the underlying processes. In particular it should be possible to study reactions that require the intact sensor kinase such as signal transduction across the membrane. Questions of this type cannot be addressed in a system using genetically truncated and solubilized domains due to the transmembranous arrangement of sensory and kinase domains and the need for the membrane intrinsic domains for signal transfer."

An integral step in the activation of NF-κB involves the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα.

In view of growing evidence that the IκB kinases (IKKs), notably IKKβ, are involved in signal induced phosphorylation of IκBα, we ascertained whether IKKβ is necessary and sufficient for Bcl-2 mediated NF-κB activation. Here we demonstrate that expression of Bcl-2 in ventricular myocytes resulted in an increase in NF-κB-dependent DNA binding, NF-κB gene transcription and reduced IκBα levels.

Cancer. 1993; 67: 205-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Despite the obvious beneficial effects, there is increasing awareness that defects in regulatory pathways that govern the apoptotic process may contribute to a number of human pathologies (reviewed in Refs. 4Martin S.J.

Recently, an antiapoptotic function for NF-κB1 has been described (6Wu M. Lee H. Bellas R.E. Schauer S.L. Arsura M. Katz D. FitzGerald M.J. Rothstein T.L. Sherr D.H. Sonenshein G.E.

Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). This is largely substantiated by studies in which genetic loss or functional inactivation of NF-κB renders cells sensitive to proapoptotic signals including inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α (7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 8Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2452) Google Scholar). In cells, NF-κB exists as a heterodimeric complex composed of 50- and 65-kDa protein subunits bound to the inhibitory protein, inhibitor of κB (IκBα) (9Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D.

Ostensibly, IκBα prevents nuclear targeting of NF-κB by masking its nuclear localization motif. The mechanism by which biological signals activate NF-κB in vivo is poorly defined; however, recent studies suggest a mechanism that involves the post-translational modification and degradation of IκBα (12Lenardo M.J. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar, 13Verma I.M. Stevenson J.K. Schwarz E.M. Van Antwerp D. Miyamoto S.

Mutagenesis studies have revealed serine residues 32 and 36 of IκBα to be crucial for signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα and subsequent NF-κB activation. Deletion mutations or substitution of these critical serine resides with alanine renders the IκBα molecule defective for phosphorylation. Nonphosphorylatable IκBα mutants remain constitutively bound to NF-κB, preventing NF-κB activation (16Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C. McKinsey T.A. Hall S.M., Qi, X. Lee W.Y. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2809-2818Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, regulation of IκBα by phosphorylation represents a key point in the activation of NF-κB (16Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

Insight into the signaling mechanisms that lead to IκBα phosphorylation have identified a large molecular weight protein complex known collectively as the IκB kinase (IKK) signalosome and includes IKKα, IKKβ, and IKKγ (18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar, 19Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L., Li, J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). IKKα and IKKβ have been identified as catalytic subunits, whereas IKKγ is a regulatory subunit (reviewed in Refs. 18Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar and 20May M.J. Ghosh S. Science. 1999; 284: 271-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A general paradigm for the activation of NF-κB by the IKK complex purports that signal-induced activation of the IκB kinases phosphorylates IκBα at serine residues 32 and 36, which triggers subsequent IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation (reviewed in Refs. 18Karin M.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2063Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic ablation experiments indicate that IKKβ may be more important in controlling NF-κB activation than IKKα (22Tanaka M. Fuentes M.E. Yamaguchi K. Durnin M.H. Dalrymple S.A.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). This is supported by studies in which kinase-defective mutants of IKKβ that fail to phosphorylate IκBα render cells more sensitive to pro-death signals (25Li Z.W. Chu W., Hu, Y. Delhase M. Deerinck T. Ellisman M. Johnson R. Karin M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1839-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fact that IKKβ kinase knock-out mice die at embryonic day 14.5 from massive liver degeneration and apoptosis, similar to the p65−/− knockouts, illustrates the importance of IKKβ for the NF-κB activation pathway and the suppression of apoptosis (22Tanaka M.

Bronson R.T. Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1995; 376: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar). In contrast, disruption of IKKα alleles appear to only mildly affect NF-κB activation despite perinatal death of the mice from severe morphogenic defects and keratinocyte abnormalities (23Takeda K. Takeuchi O. Tsujimura T. Itami S. Adachi O. Kawai T. Sanjo H. Yoshikawa K. Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 24Li Q., Lu, Q. Hwang J.Y.

Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). The significance of NF-κB activation for the suppression of apoptosis is further illustrated by the recent demonstration that life-promoting signals mediated through Ras/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt intersect the IKK complex to activate NF-κB and prevent apoptosis (28Ozes O.N. Mayo L.D. Gustin J.A. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar, 29Romashkova J.A. Makarov S.S.

Although the molecular mechanisms that underlie apoptosis are poorly defined, recent evidence suggests that Bcl-2 may play a key role in this process (31Reed J.C. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2389) Google Scholar, 32Korsmeyer S.J. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 101-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). The fact that Bcl-2 can delay or prevent apoptosis provoked by a variety of death- promoting signals, suggests that it probably impinges on more than one component of the death signaling pathway. Structure function studies have identified several key domains within Bcl-2 with putative antiapoptotic properties (33Hunter J.J. Bond B.L. Parslow T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 877-883Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Hanada M. Aime Sempe C. Sato T. Reed J.C. J. Biol.

Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). In particular, the N terminus of Bcl-2, which encompasses an amphipathic α-helical loop designated the BH4 domain, has been suggested to be important in suppressing apoptosis through the formation of protein-protein interactions with key factors in the cell death pathway including calcineurin and Raf-1 (36Wang H.G.

We have recently shown that NF-κB is activated in ventricular myocytes expressing Bcl-2 (40de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 41de Moissac D. Zheng H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29505-29509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). This was attributed to Bcl-2-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα at serine residues 32 and 36 followed by IκBα degradation by the proteasome (40de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), since mutations that abrogated IκBα phosphorylation at these serine residues or interventions that blocked IκBα degradation by the proteasome prevented Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB activation. However, the signaling mechanism leading to Bcl-2-mediated IκBα phosphorylation and NF-κB activation is undetermined. In view of the growing evidence that the IκB kinases, notably IKKβ, are involved in signal-induced activation of NF-κB, we ascertained in the present study whether Bcl-2 impinges on IKKβ to activate NF-κB. In this report, we provide compelling new evidence that activation of NF-κB by Bcl-2 occurs through a mechanism that involves the antiapoptotic BH4 domain of Bcl-2 and the Raf-1/MEKK-1 signaling pathway. We further demonstrate that the IKKβ is necessary and sufficient for Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB activation in ventricular myocytes. Neonatal ventricular myocytes were isolated from 2-day-old Sprague-Dawley rat hearts and submitted to primary culture under serum-free conditions as described (40de Moissac D. Mustapha S.

Cells were transfected or infected with the cytomegalovirus-driven eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or adenovirus lacking the cDNA insert for all transfection controls. To control for potential differences in transfection efficiency among cell cultures, luciferase reporter activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity and expressed as -fold increase. Following cell transfection or adenoviral infection, 293 cells or ventricular myocytes were washed and maintained in 10% fetal bovine serum-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 24 h. Data was obtained from at least n = 3 independent cell cultures with replicates of 3 for each condition tested. Results were compared by Scheffe's multiple comparison test for analysis of variance and the unpaired two-tailed student t test, using a significance level of p < 0.05. Following a 24-h transfection, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were harvested in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and subjected to in vitrokinase assay as previously reported by Tang et al.(47Tang G.

In brief, equivalent amounts of cell lysate (300 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKβ IgG (0.4 μg of antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) and washed in kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). The immunoprecipitates were incubated with 1 μg of either GST-IκBα or GST-IκBα S32A,S36A, 1 mm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in kinase buffer for 30 min at 30 °C. The cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to verify equivalent amounts of IKKβ protein. Equivalent amounts of GST-IκBα were verified by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS gels. For immunodetection of IκBα protein, human embryonic 293 cells and ventricular myocytes were harvested in 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (radioimmune precipitation buffer). Cell lysates (50 μg) were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at 140 V for 4 h and electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Diagnostics). For detection of IκBα protein, the polyvinylidene difluoride filter was incubated for 3 h with a mouse monoclonal antibody directed toward human IκBα protein clone C21 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.3% Tween 20, 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Expression of wild type and ΔBH4 deletion mutant forms of Bcl-2 proteins were detected using a hamster monoclonal antibody directed toward Bcl-2 (Pharmingen). All transfection experiments involving wild type and Bcl-2ΔBH4 mutant were subjected to Western blot analysis to verify equivalent Bcl-2 protein expression. For detection of transfected IKKβ Myc or IκBα FLAG-tagged proteins, cell lysates were incubated with murine anti-FLAG M2 or anti-Myc antibody, respectively (Kodak, Pharmingen) and immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose beads (AmershamBiosciences) at 4 °C for 4 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed and mixed with Laemmli loading buffer, boiled, and subjected to gel electrophoresis as described above. Bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence reaction with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against mouse or hamster IgG using ECL reagents (AmershamBiosciences). Nuclear morphology was assessed by Hoechst 33258 dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) as previously reported (49Kirshenbaum L.A. Schneider M.D. J. Biol.

To provoke apoptosis in 293 cells, cells were stimulated for 24 h with TNF-α (10 μg/ml) in the presence of (5 μg/ml) cycloheximide as previously reported (7Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. percentage from control. Nuclear extracts of cells were prepared as previously described by McKinsey et al.(17McKinsey T.A. Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C., Al Murrani S.W. Green P.L. Ballard D.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 32P-radiolabeled duplex oliogonucleotide probe with NF-κB consensus binding sites, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCGCAGGC-3′, was used as a template for the gel shift experiments (16Brockman J.A. Scherer D.C.

DNA binding reaction mixtures (20 μg) were carried out on ice and contained 10 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of double-stranded probe, poly(dI-dC) (AmershamBiosciences), and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin in 20 mmHEPES (pH 7.9), 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol. Nuclear-protein complexes were resolved on a native 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× Tris borate EDTA, pH 8.0, and detected by autoradiography. Multiple comparisons between groups were determined by one-way analysis of variance. Unpaired two tailed Student's t test was used to compare mean differences between groups. Differences were considered to be statistically significant to a level of p < 0.05. In all cases the data were obtained from at least n = 3 independent cell cultures using three replicates for each condition tested. Our earlier work (40de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H.

For these experiments, cardiac myocytes were transfected with catalytically inactive forms of the IκB kinases, IKKαK-M and IKKβK-M, previously shown to impair NF-κB activation (19Mercurio F. Zhu H.

Expression of Bcl-2 in cells resulted in a significant 1.3-fold increase (p < 0.05) in NF-κB gene activation compared with control cells (Fig.1). Interestingly, Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB gene transcription was suppressed to basal levels by the kinase-defective IKKβK-M. Importantly, similar effects were observed with an alternate IKKβ mutant, IKKβK-A, 2D. De Moissac and L. A. Kirshenbaum, unpublished data. indicating that the inhibitory effects observed on Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB gene activation were not restricted to the IKKβK-M point mutation utilized. In contrast, Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB gene transcription was impaired to a lesser extent with the kinase-defective IKKα. The finding that the kinase-defective IKKβ had a greater inhibitory effect on Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB activation is consistent with reports documenting that IKKβ may be more important than IKKα for NF-κB activation (19Mercurio F.

Electromobility shift analysis of nuclear extract from ventricular myocytes expressing Bcl-2 revealed an increase in NF-κB-dependent DNA binding (Fig.2 A, lane 2) compared with control cells (lane 1), a finding consistent with the transcription data. Importantly, Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB-dependent DNA binding was impaired in cells expressing the kinase-defective IKKβΔKD (Fig.2, lane 4 versus lane 2). In contrast, mutations outside the kinase domain that render IKKβ defective for dimerization (IKKβΔLZ) minimally impaired NF-κB DNA binding (Fig. 2, lane 3), indicating that this region of IKKβ may not be important for Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB activation. Further, Bcl-2-mediated NF-κB-dependent DNA binding was impaired by the nonphosphorylatable IκBα S32A,S36A mutant. Since NF-κB activity is largely governed by IKKβ-dependent phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα, we next tested whether IKKβ activity is increased in cells expressing Bcl-2. For these experiments, cell lysate derived from HEK 293 cells expressing Bcl-2 was immunoprecipitated with a murine antibody directed toward IKKβ and subjected to in vitrokinase assay. As shown in Fig. 2 B, transfection of 293 cells with wild type IKKβ resulted in an 18.5-fold increase (p < 0.05) in GST-IκBα phosphorylation compared with vector-transfected cells or cells expressing the IKKβK-M kinase mutant, a finding consistent with our IKKβ transcription data. Moreover, a 2.9-fold (p < 0.05) increase in GST-IκBα phosphorylation was observed in cells expressing Bcl-2 compared with vector transfected cells. Transfection of 293 cells with the kinase-defective mutant IKKβK-Msuppressed Bcl-2-mediated phosphorylation of GST-IκBα. Importantly, Bcl-2 had no effect on the GST-IκBα S32A,S36A defective for phosphorylation at serine residues 32 and 36,2 concordant with our previous data indicating that these residues are crucial for Bcl-2-mediated phosphorylation of IκBα (40de Moissac D. Mustapha S. Greenberg A.H. Kirshenbaum L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23946-23951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of cardiac cell lysate derived from Bcl-2-expressing cells displayed a marked reduction in IκBα protein levels compared with vector-transfected control cells. Importantly, the Bcl-2-mediated loss of IκBα could be prevented with the kinase-defective IKKβK-M, Fig.3, suggesting its involvement in Bcl-2-mediated IκBα phosphorylation. To verify that IKKβ is necessary and sufficient for Bcl-2-mediated effects on NF-κB activation, we next tested whether Bcl-2 could activate NF-κB in nullizygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient for IKKβ. In contrast to wild type cells, IKKβ−/− cells failed to activate NF-κB gene transcription in the presence of Bcl-2 (Fig4). Importantly, transfection of IKKβ−/− cells with a eukaryotic expres"
https://openalex.org/W2057672107,"The yeast F1F0-ATP synthase forms dimeric complexes in the mitochondrial inner membrane and in a manner that is supported by the F0-sector subunits, Su e and Su g. Furthermore, it has recently been demonstrated that the binding of the F1F0-ATPase natural inhibitor protein to purified bovine F1-sectors can promote their dimerization in solution (Cabezon, E., Arechaga, I., Jonathan P., Butler, G., and Walker J. E. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 28353-28355). It was unclear until now whether the binding of the inhibitor protein to the F1 domains contributes to the process of F1F0-ATP synthase dimerization in intact mitochondria. Here we have directly addressed the involvement of the yeast inhibitor protein, Inh1, and its known accessory proteins, Stf1 and Stf2, in the formation of the yeast F1F0-ATP synthase dimer. Using mitochondria isolated from null mutants deficient in Inh1, Stf1, and Stf2, we demonstrate that formation of the F(1)F(0)-ATP synthase dimers is not adversely affected by the absence of these proteins. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the F1F0-ATPase monomers present in su e null mutant mitochondria can be as effectively inhibited by Inh1, as its dimeric counterpart in wild-type mitochondria. We conclude that dimerization of the F1F0-ATP synthase complexes involves a physical interaction of the membrane-embedded F0 sectors from two monomeric complexes and in a manner that is independent of inhibitory activity of the Inh1 and accessory proteins."

A similar decrease in lateral mobility as observed upon photoactivation was obtained when bacteriorhodopsin was reconstituted at high protein-to-lipid ratios (>1:10 w/w). We interpret the shifts in mobility during light adaptation as being caused by transient photoinduced oligomerization of bacteriorhodopsin.

BR and G-protein-coupled receptors share in common a seven-helix topology, and both are thought to operate by a similar switching mechanism (5Subramaniam S. Henderson R.

Thus, the structural changes that push a single proton through the seven-helix bundle from the cell interior to the extracellular milieu (13Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 2000; 406: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Lanyi J.K. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have been described with atomic detail. An intriguing question that remains to be resolved is whether the spatial organization of BR, which forms two-dimensional hexagonal crystals of trimers in the native membrane (2Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), plays a functional role in proton transport. Such a change in organization could be instrumental, for example, in promoting or regulating the proton-pumping rate or proton transport, and several hypotheses have been proposed in this regard, but no consensus has been reached yet (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Sternberg B. Gale P. Watts A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 117-126Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Casadio R. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3374-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the hexagonal packing does not appear to be required for the function of a protein (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the question as to whether aggregation into a trimer or larger oligomeric structure underlies a functional property has yet to be addressed.The aggregation state of BR has been investigated by several techniques. In the CD spectrum, the purple membrane exhibits a characteristic excitonic signal caused by interactions between the protein chromophores in the closely packed hexagonal lattice (18Heyn M.P. Bauer P.-J. Dencher N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A similar signal is detectable in BR, reconstituted into liposomes, and analyzed below the phase transition temperature (T c) of the phospholipids used (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, above T c, the excitonic effects disappear, and only at high protein-to-lipid ratios (>1:10 w/w) is a considerable amount of exciton coupling observed (19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The disappearance of the exciton component in the CD spectrum has been interpreted as dissociation of the aggregate, yielding a monomeric dispersion of BR in the plane of the membrane (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analogous conclusions were drawn from measurements of anisotropy decay of transient absorption changes (19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).Based upon a freeze fracture electron microscopy study (20Gulik-Krzywicki T. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15580-15588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the monomeric state of BR in proteoliposomes was questioned. In fact, such a state was only observed at very low protein-to-lipid ratios (<1:40 w/w), whereas self-association of BR occurred at protein-to-lipid ratios at which the excitonic feature is not yet detectable in the CD spectrum. Evidently, the latter technique is of insufficient sensitivity to detect the early presence of small(er) oligomers in BR liposomes. In the EM studies, aggregation of BR in the dark/light-adapted state was not investigated (20Gulik-Krzywicki T. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15580-15588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Here, we report for the first time on the lateral mobility and the state of molecular association of BR, reconstituted into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV), i.e. model membranes that display cell-like dimensions. We show by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (21Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 22Schwille P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 383-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) that at low protein-to-lipid ratios (<1:10 w/w), a mobility change is associated with BR photoactivation. These findings on transient BR aggregation during light adaptation are confirmed by electron microscopy.DISCUSSIONIn this work, we have demonstrated that upon photoactivation of bacteriorhodopsin, the distribution of the protein is reorganized from monomers/trimers into larger oligomers, a process that is entirely reversible upon interruption of the light-activated state. Because the protein has been functionally reconstituted, our data imply that upon light-activated conditions, the protein acquires a multimeric organization and likely consists of two or three trimers (Fig. 8; see below).In the native membrane, BR forms a hexagonal lattice of trimers (2Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar). Reconstitution with synthetic lipids at protein-to-lipid ratios lower than in the native state causes the loss of the reticular order, but the protein retains its proton pumping activity (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A long-standing issue is whether the lattice or an oligomeric organization in the membrane plays a role in the regulation of the proton pumping. Here, we show that the aggregation from monomeric/trimeric to a larger oligomeric form has no effect on the specific proton pumping activity of BR.There is increasing evidence that transport and signal transduction proteins, in general, form functionally relevant oligomeric complexes in membranes (34Veenhoff L.M. Heuberger E.H.M.L. Poolman B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 242-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In case of G-protein-coupled receptors, of which BR is considered a model (35Duke T.A.J. Bray D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10104-10108Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the functional significance and the dynamics of their known oligomerization remain to be elucidated (36Bouvier M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 274-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar,37Kirkpatrick P. Nat. Rev. Drug Discovery. 2002; 1: 7-8Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Hence, the present observations concerning BR dynamics may bear potential relevance to functional mechanisms of structurally similar proteins, such as G-protein-coupled receptors.Here, we have shown for the first time that the spatial organization of BR correlates with its state of photoactivation. At fairly low protein concentrations, the protein in the dark-adapted state is dispersed as well defined small particles, whereas in the light-adapted state the protein rearranges into much larger clusters. At higher protein-to-lipid ratios, the spatial organization is mainly determined by the local density of the protein. No larger clusters could be observed upon photoactivation, thus suggesting that as a result of factors that remain to be determined, a cluster size limit exists. Although the data strongly support the view of photoactivation-induced clustering of BR as the cause of changes in its lateral mobility, it is possible that illumination-induced conformational changes could contribute as well. However, unrealistically large conformational changes would then be required, following photoactivation. Arguments based on a hydrodynamics theory (38Cantor C.R. Schimmel P.R. Biophysical Chemistry, Part II. W. H. Freeman & Co., San Francisco1980: 358-412Google Scholar) indicate that differences in mobility, as reported here (lightversus dark), should elongate the molecule at least 9–14 times along the direction parallel to the plane of the membrane. X-ray crystallography studies of intermediate states of BR during the photocycle exclude this possibility (10Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 13Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 2000; 406: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar).In the past, several studies have been carried out to determine the oligomerization state of BR in artificial liposomes (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Sternberg B. Gale P. Watts A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 117-126Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Casadio R. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3374-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and the discrepancies found, for instance between circular dichroism and freeze fracture electron microscopy, are most likely due to the relatively poor sensitivity of the techniques (20Gulik-Krzywicki T. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15580-15588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Bauer P.J. Dencher M.A. Heyn M.P. Biophys. Struct. Mech. 1976; 2: 79-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 40Hiraki K. Hamanaka T. Mitsui T. Kito Y. Photochem. Photobiol. 1981; 33: 429-433Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In particular, there are good reasons to believe that the excitonic feature in the CD spectrum appears only upon extended exciton coupling in large BR oligomers or in the crystal, but the (in)sensitivity of the method precludes to unequivocally probe the state of aggregation. In this respect, FCS is the preferred technique to study in detail the diffusional dynamics of bacteriorhodopsin and is sensitive enough to monitor protein mobility at very low protein-to-lipid ratios and to detect association phenomena at conditions of a very limited degree of oligomerization.The FCS data can be properly fitted by using an anomalous diffusion model or a two-component Brownian diffusion model. It is possible that the deviation from normal diffusion is the result of different, coexisting diffusion coefficients or, alternatively, may result from the occurrence of protein-protein and lipid-protein interactions that give rise to correlated motions and anomalous subdiffusion. In the case of the two-component Brownian model, the slowest component (fraction of 30%) essentially reflects the presence of an immobile fraction. Note that this fraction does not reflect the presence of docked, nonfused, LUV on the GUV surface, because the FCS curves were recorded from regions of GUV with a smooth fluorescence signal. Accordingly, this fraction might indicate the presence of immobile BR clusters in the GUV membrane.Intramembrane particle size analysis conducted on freeze fracture electron micrographs revealed a broad and multimodal size distribution. The weighted average for a typical size distribution of a sample at a low protein-to-lipid ratio and in the dark-adapted state is about 6.0 ± 0.5 or 4.3 ± 0.5 nm, when corrected for the thickness of deposited metal film (1.7 nm). Because the cross-sectional area of a single BR obtained by x-ray is 2.5 × 3.2 nm2, this size distribution would match that of a population of monomers and trimers. At the same protein-to-lipid ratios, light-adapted BR particles have a weighted average size of 10.5 ± 0.5 nm, corrected to 8.8 ± 0.5 nm, which would correspond to an average cluster of six to nine subunits. Eskandari et al. (41Eskandari S. Wright E.M. Freman M. Starace D.M. Zampighi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11235-11240Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) have found a linear correlation between the protein cross-sectional areas derived from two-dimensional crystals and the number of membrane-spanning α-helices, each helix occupying on average 1.40 ± 0.03 nm2. Particles with a size distribution around a corrected radius of 4.3 ± 0.5 nm would thus contain 10.5 helices on average and therefore, correspond to a combination of monomers (seven transmembrane α-helices) and trimers, whereas a corrected average radius of 8.8 ± 0.5 nm corresponds to 44 helices on average. Given the multimodal complexity of the size distributions obtained, especially in the light-adapted state, these are only rough indications of an average size but are consistent with the hypothesis of BR assemblies of two or three trimers in the light-adapted state.Next to a qualitative agreement between FCS and EM, we also considered a quantitative comparison of the data. From EM, it can be determined that the ratio between the average particle radii in the light-adapted (8.8 ± 0.5 nm) and dark-adapted states (4.3 ± 0.5 nm) is ≈ 2. By FCS, particle radii are not directly measured, but rather diffusion constants and the ratio between the diffusion constants of BR in the dark-adapted (0.8 μm2/sa) and in the light-adapted states (0.2 μm2/sa), respectively, is ≈ 4. If we assume a Brownian diffusion model of spherical particles diffusing in a continuous medium, the Einstein relation holds (42Kubo R. Toda M. Hashitsume N. Statistical Physics. 2. Springer, Berlin, Germany1985: 10Google Scholar). D=kT6πηREquation 4 where k is the Boltzmann constant, T is the absolute temperature, η is the viscosity of the medium, andR is the sphere radius. In this frame, the ratio between diffusion constants becomesD 1/D 2 = η2 R 2/η1 R 1≈ 4. In a case where the viscosities are the same,R 2/R 1 ≈ 4, which represents an offset with respect to the ratio obtained by freeze fracture electron microscopy (≈ 2). However, the fitting of the FCS data, according to the anomalous diffusion model, indicates that the protein dynamics do not correspond to a simple Brownian diffusion of spherical particles in a continuous medium. The situation is more complicated and appears to involve a more complex hydrodynamical model in which the lipids may play an important role, which could cause the offset between the two techniques. As indicated in several previous studies (3Haupts U. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 367-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 43Sternberg B. Watts A. Cejka Z. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 110: 196-204Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 44Dracheva S. Bose S. Hendler R.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 382: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), protein-protein interactions for bacteriorhodopsin are lipid-mediated. A role of the lipids in the aggregation phenomenon should be considered not only in terms of specific lipid-protein interactions (in the experiments reported here bacteriorhodopsin retains part of the tightly bound native lipids) but also in terms of collective lipid properties, such as viscosity and domain formation. This might explain the discrepancies often observed among preparations with different lipid compositions.Finally, it is of relevance to briefly discuss the structural basis of BR clustering upon photoactivation. Clustering occurs already at a very low protein-to-lipid ratio and, given that the GUV is essentially composed of DOPC, is very likely driven by an intrinsic affinity of the protein for itself, rather than being caused by protein segregation from the bulk lipids into a lipid microdomain. This behavior might reflect the tendency of the protein to increase the self-association during proton pumping to increase the stability of the protein. 2D. Oesterhelt, personal communication. We do not have indications that BR in the aggregated state (two or three trimers) has a higher specific activity than the trimer. The structural mechanism for the increase in protein-protein affinity and formation of transient large clusters can be manifold. X-ray crystallography, cryo-EM, and EPR studies have clearly shown the occurrence of significant conformational changes of BR during the photocycle, such as bending of certain helices and cooperative movements of the external soluble loops (10Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R. Nature. 2000; 406: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 12Subramaniam S. Henderson R. J. Struct.

Khorana H.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1120-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These structural changes might act simultaneously together with changes in specific protein-lipid interactions, but also changes in the solvation shell around the soluble loops caused by local pH changes may lead to a global increase of the protein self-affinity.In conclusion, oligomerization of bacteriorhodopsin, spontaneously occurring upon photoactivation, might increase the efficiency or facilitate the regulation of the proton transport. The present work merits further investigation on this signal-triggered spatial reorganization, which may be a feature common to many other cell membrane receptors involved in signaling and transport pathways. Halophilic archaea are salt-loving microorganisms that use bright sunlight as a source of energy (1Oesterhelt D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 489-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For this purpose, they host in their cell membrane bacteriorhodopsin (2Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 3Haupts U. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 367-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) a 26-kDa transmembrane protein that converts light into an electrochemical proton gradient. Bacteriorhodopsin (BR)1 is considered to be a prototype for a membrane transporter (4Lanyi J.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31209-31212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) and also serves as a structure model for G-protein-coupled receptors. BR and G-protein-coupled receptors share in common a seven-helix topology, and both are thought to operate by a similar switching mechanism (5Subramaniam S. Henderson R. Nature. 2000; 406: 653-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 6Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

Sci. 2001; 26: 318-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The overall mechanism of proton pumping is well understood, and three-dimensional structures at high resolution are available for the ground state (8Luecke H. Richter H.-T. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1998; 280: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) as well as for several intermediate states of the photocycle (9Luecke H. Schobert B. Richter H.-T. Cartailler J.-P. Lanyi J.K. Science. 1999; 286: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar, 10Royant A. Edman K. Ursby T. Pebay-Peyroula E. Landau E.M. Neutze R.

Thus, the structural changes that push a single proton through the seven-helix bundle from the cell interior to the extracellular milieu (13Kühlbrandt W. Nature. 2000; 406: 569-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 14Lanyi J.K. Luecke H. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 415-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) have been described with atomic detail. An intriguing question that remains to be resolved is whether the spatial organization of BR, which forms two-dimensional hexagonal crystals of trimers in the native membrane (2Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Nat. New Biol. 1971; 233: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar), plays a functional role in proton transport. Such a change in organization could be instrumental, for example, in promoting or regulating the proton-pumping rate or proton transport, and several hypotheses have been proposed in this regard, but no consensus has been reached yet (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 16Sternberg B. Gale P. Watts A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 980: 117-126Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 17Casadio R. Stoeckenius W. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 3374-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Although the hexagonal packing does not appear to be required for the function of a protein (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the question as to whether aggregation into a trimer or larger oligomeric structure underlies a functional property has yet to be addressed. The aggregation state of BR has been investigated by several techniques. In the CD spectrum, the purple membrane exhibits a characteristic excitonic signal caused by interactions between the protein chromophores in the closely packed hexagonal lattice (18Heyn M.P. Bauer P.-J. Dencher N.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 67: 897-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A similar signal is detectable in BR, reconstituted into liposomes, and analyzed below the phase transition temperature (T c) of the phospholipids used (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, above T c, the excitonic effects disappear, and only at high protein-to-lipid ratios (>1:10 w/w) is a considerable amount of exciton coupling observed (19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The disappearance of the exciton component in the CD spectrum has been interpreted as dissociation of the aggregate, yielding a monomeric dispersion of BR in the plane of the membrane (15Dencher N.A. Heyn M.P. FEBS Lett. 1979; 108: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Analogous conclusions were drawn from measurements of anisotropy decay of transient absorption changes (19Cherry R.J. Müller U. Henderson R. Heyn M.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 121: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Based upon a freeze fracture electron microscopy study (20Gulik-Krzywicki T. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15580-15588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the monomeric state of BR in proteoliposomes was questioned. In fact, such a state was only observed at very low protein-to-lipid ratios (<1:40 w/w), whereas self-association of BR occurred at protein-to-lipid ratios at which the excitonic feature is not yet detectable in the CD spectrum. Evidently, the latter technique is of insufficient sensitivity to detect the early presence of small(er) oligomers in BR liposomes. In the EM studies, aggregation of BR in the dark/light-adapted state was not investigated (20Gulik-Krzywicki T. Seigneuret M. Rigaud J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15580-15588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we report for the first time on the lateral mobility and the state of molecular association of BR, reconstituted into giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV), i.e. model membranes that display cell-like dimensions. We show by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) (21Eigen M. Rigler R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5740-5747Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 22Schwille P. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 34: 383-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) that at low protein-to-lipid ratios (<1:10 w/w), a mobility change is associated with BR photoactivation. These findings on transient BR aggregation during light adaptation are confirmed by electron microscopy. DISCUSSIONIn this"

These enzymes have in common a biosynthetic pathway involving the endoplasmic reticulum but differ regarding their cellular location. Their catalytic sites are directed either to the lumen of the endomembrane system or the cell surface, or they are released from cells. This implies that they can either be involved in intraorganellar metabolic reactions or serve extracellular nucleotide metabolism. The seven members of the ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (E-NTPDase)1 family hydrolyze nucleoside triphosphates and diphosphates, albeit with varying preference (review and nomenclature in Refs. 1Zimmermann H.

NTPDase1 to NTPDase3 (CD39, CD39L1, CD39L3) are typical ecto-enzymes and are thought to play a major role in controlling intercellular signaling mediated by nucleoside tri- and diphosphates, including platelet aggregation (3Enjyoji K.

The other four members of this enzyme family have a predominant intracellular localization. The two closely related variants of NTPDase4 (UDPase/hLALPv and hLALP70) are enriched in the Golgi apparatus (UDPase) (5Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol.

Both enzymes hydrolyze a variety of nucleoside tri- and diphosphates but ATP only to a minor extent. The murine orthologue of NTPDase5 was allocated to the ER (ER-UDPase, 8).

Sequences related to the insect salivary apyrases can be found in mammalian species (19Valenzuela J.G. Charlab R. Galperin M.Y. Ribeiro J.M.C. J. Biol.

Biol. 2001; 204: 229-237PubMed Google Scholar). It therefore appeared possible that these encode secreted apyrases. We have cloned and sequenced the rat homologue of the solubleCimex apyrase and studied its cellular distribution and catalytic properties. Our results demonstrate that both the cellular localization and the catalytic properties of the mammalian enzyme differ from its insect relatives. It represents a membrane-bound Ca2+-dependent nucleoside diphosphatase (Ca2+-NDPase) that is targeted to the ER following heterologous expression. SuperScriptII™ human brain pCMV-SPORT 1 cDNA library, SuperScriptII™ rat brain pCMV-SPORT 2 cDNA library, TrizolTM reagent, reverse transcriptase SuperScriptTMII, cell culture media Ham's F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, horse serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were from Invitrogen. Cloning vector pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B and oligo(dT) cellulose were purchased from Invitrogen. Hybond N membrane, [α-32P]dCTP, and the enhanced chemiluminescence system were from Amersham Biosciences. Anti-digoxigenin alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibody and a chemiluminescent substrate, (disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro-{1,2-dioxoethane-2′,3-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13′,7]decan}-4-yl)phenyl phosphate), were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. SawadyPwo DNA polymerase was from Peqlab, Biotechnologie GmbH (Erlangen, Germany). Taq DNA polymerase and restriction endonucleases were purchased from MBI Fermentas (St. Leon-Rot, Germany). Nucleoside triphosphate, diphosphate, and monophosphate sodium salts, poly(D-lysine), phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and proteinase K were obtained from Sigma. Triton X-100 and Triton X-114 were from Serva (Heidelberg, Germany). AlexaFluor-488TM-conjugated lectin WGA was from Molecular Probes (Leiden, Netherlands). Rabbit anti-calnexin carboxyl terminus polyclonal antibody was purchased from StressGen (Victoria, B.C., Canada), and the mouse monoclonal antibody against the Myc epitope was derived from clone 9E10. The polyclonal CY3-labeled anti-rabbit IgG, fluorescein isothiocyanate, CY3-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibodies, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). The Nucleobond X-500 plasmid purification kit was purchased from Macherey and Nagel (Düren, Germany). Nitrocellulose membranes were from Schleicher & Schüll (Dassel, Germany). The protease inhibitors chymostatin, pepstatin, benzamidine, antipain, and leupeptin were obtained from Calbiochem. ElectrocompetentEscherichia coli XL10 gold were transformed with a human brain pCMV-SPORT 1 cDNA library. Approximately 0.5 × 106 colonies were plated on Luria-Bertani/ampicillin agar plates. A 300-bp PCR fragment (forward primer, 5′-TACCAGATCGAAGGCAGCAA-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GCAGGCAGACTCATGGATGA-3′; template human brain pCMV-SPORT 1 cDNA library) was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by PCR. Transformants were screened by colony hybridization with the radiolabeled probe. Positive signal areas were amplified and rescreened for single positive colonies. The complete coding sequence of the rat Ca2+-NDPase was obtained by PCR using the forward primer, 5′-CCATACAGGTCCTGTCCAGAGTGC-3′, the reverse primer, 5′-GGTTTTTATGAGTCCTGGTGTAACACAGC-3′, and a rat brain pCMV-SPORT 2 cDNA library as a template. The resulting 1.3-kb fragment was digested with XbaI and cloned into the SmaI andXbaI restriction sites of the pCMV SPORT 1 vector. An expression vector containing a carboxyl-terminal Myc-tagged sequence was generated by digestion of pCMV SPORT 1/Ca2+-NDPase withEcoRI, followed by ligation with pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B. 5′-Truncated myc-tagged and non-tagged plasmids were obtained by amplification of a 1.2-kb fragment using the forward primer, 5′-TGAATTCCAGTGCTGGCATCCATGACC-3′, the reverse primer, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′, and pCMV SPORT 1/Ca2+-NDPase as a template. The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and ligated with EcoRI cut pCMV SPORT 1/Ca2+-NDPase and pcDNA3.1(−)/Myc-His B. DNA sequencing was performed by Scientific Research and Development GmbH (Oberursel, Germany). The Omiga 2.0 sequence analysis program (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, UK) was used for assembling sequencing fragments, translating DNA into amino acid sequences, generating hydrophobicity plots (21Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar), and amino acid sequence alignment (CLUSTAL W algorithm), including establishing the dendrogram. For prediction of transmembrane domains, the software TMpred (www.ch.embnet.org/software/TMPRED form.html) was employed. For signal peptide and sorting analysis, SignalP 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP-2.0/) and PSORT II (psort.nibb.ac.jp/form2.html) were used. The DNA and deduced amino acid sequences were analyzed for similarity to known sequences with the NCBI Blast Network service (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). Protein motif search was performed using the PROSITE data base (pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/npsa_automat.pl?page=npsa_prosite.html). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were cultured as previously described (22Kegel B. Braun N. Heine P. Maliszewski C.R. Zimmermann H. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1189-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by electroporation with one of the above described plasmids in electroporation buffer (137 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.7 mmNa2HPO4, 6 mm dextrose, 20 mm Hepes at pH 7) using a BTX Electrocell manipulator 600. In control experiments cells were transfected with empty vector alone. 24 h after electroporation the culture medium of CHO cells was exchanged to remove dead cells and debris. After an additional 10 h, sodium butyrate was added at a final concentration of 6 mm. The conditioned culture medium was removed 48 h after electroporation, and cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, washed twice in isotonic buffer A (140 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), and finally centrifuged at 300 ×g av. Following resuspension with buffer A, cells were supplemented with protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml chymostatin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin), homogenized, and centrifuged for 10 min at 300 × g av at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g av for 45 min at 4 °C, and pellets were resuspended in 50% glycerol and stored at −20 °C. Substrate specificity was determined by incubating membrane fractions in phosphate-free solution containing 0.02% Triton X-100, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.5 mm substrate. Samples were heat-inactivated for 4 min at 95 °C prior to determination of inorganic phosphate (23Lanzetta P.A. Alvarez L.J. Reinach P.S. Candia O.A. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 100: 95-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1821) Google Scholar). The optimal pH range was determined using a combined buffer (50 mm Hepes and 50 mm glycine) ranging from pH 6.0 to 10.5, containing 1 mm CaCl2 and 0.5 mm UDP. Metal ion dependence was measured in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0), containing 0.5 mm UDP and either CaCl2 or MgCl2 (up to 4 mm). The K m value for UDP was determined in 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.0) and a substrate/Ca2+ ratio of 1:2. Catalytic activity of membrane fractions derived from cells transfected with the empty plasmid was subtracted from that obtained with cDNA-transfected cells. Membrane fractions corresponding to 0.4 × 106 cells transfected with full-length or truncated cDNA or with the empty plasmid were diluted in 300 μl of double distilled water, adjusted to 1% Triton X-114, and incubated on ice for 10 min. Aliquots (50 μl) were removed as controls. The remaining solution was incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. After centrifugation (12,000 × g av, 25 °C, 5 min) the aqueous phase (detergent-depleted) was removed, and the hydrophobic phase (detergent-enriched) was resuspended in ice-cold buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0). Total, aqueous, and hydrophobic phases were analyzed for UDPase activity (50 mmHepes, pH 7.0, 0.5 mm UDP, 1 mmCaCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100). Membrane fractions corresponding to 7,750 cells transfected with full-length cDNA or with the empty plasmid were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in 0.5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing either proteinase K (2.5 μg) or Triton X-100 (0.02%), proteinase K (2.5 μg) plus Triton X-100 (0.02%), or vehicle. Proteinase K activity was stopped with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at a final concentration of 1 mm. Enzyme activity was measured in 25 mmHepes (pH 7.4) containing 0.5 mm UDP, 1 mmCaCl2 in the presence or absence of 0.02% Triton X-100. No Triton X-100 was added during the enzyme assay when the effect of proteinase K alone on nucleotidase activity was to be determined. Inorganic phosphate was determined as described above. For Western blot analysis, aliquots of membrane fraction were treated with dithiothreitol and electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Immunodetection was performed with the anti-Myc antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody using the enhanced chemiluminescence method according to the manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, CHO cells (4 × 104) were seeded on poly(D-lysine)-coated (10 μg/ml) glasscover slips (10 mm diameter) and cultured for an additional 24 h. Sodium butyrate (6 mm) was added 14 h before analyzing cells. Immunofluorescence was performed either with cells fixed in methanol to analyze the intracellular distribution of antigens or with viable cells to analyze a potential surface location of the antigen (24Heilbronn A. Krapohl A. Zimmermann H. Cell Tissue Res. 1995; 280: 123-131Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (5 μg/ml), a rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (diluted 1:200), or AlexaFluor-488TM-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (diluted 1:700) was applied. After application of the secondary antibody (anti-rabbit-CY3, anti-mouse-CY3, anti-mouse-fluorescein isothiocyanate), cells were mounted and investigated with an epifluorescence microscope equipped with a MCID 4 imaging analysis system (Imaging Research, St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada) or a confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica, Bensheim, Germany). Wistar rats (200–250 g) were obtained from Charles River Wiga (Sulzfeld, Germany). Total RNA from rat intestine, spleen, thymus, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, liver, and brain were isolated with TrizolTM reagent. Northern blot analysis with polyadenylated RNA was performed as previously described (22Kegel B. Braun N. Heine P. Maliszewski C.R. Zimmermann H. Neuropharmacology. 1997; 36: 1189-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The Acc65I-digested clone, pCMV Sport 1/Ca2+-NDPase, was used as a template for the cRNA probe. The SP6/T7 polymerase and transcription kit from Roche was used to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled single-stranded antisense cRNA probes in accordance with the supplier's instructions. The C. lectularius apyrase (accession number AAD09177) was used as query for similarity searches in expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. A 0.9-kb consensus sequence was generated from human ESTs (GenBankTM accession numbers AA337541, BE410063, BE301945,AW409804, and AW402618) and used for primer design. A 300-bp PCR fragment was amplified using forward primer, 5′-TACCAGATCGAAGGCAGCAA-3′, reverse primer, 5′-GCAGGCAGACTCATGGATGA-3′, and the human brain pCMV-SPORT 1 cDNA library as a template. The fragment was radiolabeled and used for library screening. The resulting clone contained a 786-bp coding sequence and a large 3′-untranslated region. The DNA sequence was used for similarity search in human genome databases, leading to sequence completion and chromosomal localization. The gene was located twice as a triple exon variant on chromosome 17 (17q25, accession number NT010664) and on chromosome 3 (accession number AC079359). The putative human amino acid sequence was used for similarity search in a mouse EST data base. The EST sequences (GenBankTM accession numbers BF582504, AI645519, and the later released mouse mRNA sequence AK006565, which contains an additional 111 bp in the coding sequence) were used for primer design (forward primer, 5′-CCATACAGGTCCTGTCCAGAGTGC-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-GGTTTTTATGAGTCCTGGTGTAACACAGC-3′). A 1.3-kb PCR fragment amplified from the rat brain pCMV SPORT 2 cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1209 bp, encoding 403 amino acid residues. The deduced amino acid sequence (Fig. 1 A) contains one putative N-glycosylation site (Asn90) and one cysteine residue (Cys289). In addition, consensus sites for two cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites, six protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, six casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and two N-myristoylation sites could be identified. We identified an amino-terminal RXRXR motif between amino acid position 38 and 42 that may function as a ER retention/retrieval motif (25Scott D.B. Blanpied T.A. Swanson G.T. Zhang C. Ehlers M.D. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 3063-3072Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass of the encoded protein is 45.7 kDa with an isoelectric point of 6.2. The hydrophobicity analysis predicts two hydrophobic stretches in the polypeptide chain (Fig. 1 B), between residues 15 and 35 (weak) and between 45 and 63 (strong), respectively. The prediction of transmembrane domains (TM) generates two alternative models. The strongly preferred model is amino terminus outside, first TM orientation outside to inside, second TM orientation inside to outside, and carboxyl terminus outside (Fig. 1 C). The second model predicts only one transmembrane domain at the strongly hydrophobic domain (45–63) with the amino terminus inside, the TM orientation inside to outside, and carboxyl terminus outside (Fig.1 D). There are three putative start codons in-frame before the second TM. The second start codon is part of the first TM (Met15), whereas the third is situated 10 residues upstream the second TM. Signal peptide analysis predicted a signal anchor (probability 0.990) for a sequence starting with the first ATG and a signal peptide (probability 0.656) for a sequence beginning with the third start codon in-frame. A maximum cleavage site probability of 0.495 was predicted at residue 40 of the sequence beginning with the third start codon. For this reason a second and truncated clone was produced by PCR amplification of a 1.2-kb fragment, beginning with the third start codon encoding 373 amino acid residues. A mouse homologue of the cloned rat sequence could be located on chromosome 11. An analysis of mouseAK006565, BC020003, and the EST sequences revealed a potential splice variant. The sequence in AK006565 contains a 37-amino acid residue insert at position 213, as compared with the sequence in BC020003 that is homologous to the cloned rat sequence. To investigate the possible existence of a corresponding splice variant in the rat cDNA library, primers were designed around the putative insert site. PCR analysis revealed no indication of a splice variant corresponding to the mouse AK006565 sequence (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of rat full-length Ca2+-NDPase cDNA shares 86 and 95% amino acid identity with the corresponding human and mouse sequences. Ca2+-NDPase is more distantly related to the apyrases characterized in C. lectularius and P. papatasii(37 and 31%, respectively) and to sequences obtained fromDrosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae. Multiple sequence alignment of 10 sequences detected by similarity searches depicts two major groups. One group is formed by the insect sequences. Two of these have been characterized and identified as apyrases. The second group comprises related mammalian sequences, a sequence from the frog Silurana tropicalis and one from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. No related sequence could be detected in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) databases. The alignment of 10 selected sequences from vertebrate and invertebrate sources reveals several conserved clusters of amino acid residues (Fig.2). We identified eight motifs that are particularly highly conserved, one of which is directly located at the carboxyl terminus. These include amino acid positions (rat sequence) 107–116, 164–192, 199–232, 281–291, 297–305, 315–323, 345–367, 396–402. The alignment further reveals that all vertebrate sequences contain an extended amino terminus and share the three in-frame start codons. The sequence of C. elegans begins with a methionine corresponding to the third start codon of the mammalian sequences.Drosophila contains the longest sequence, with three start codons in-frame unrelated to the mammalian sequences. Although all vertebrate sequences share the two hydrophobic stretches at the amino terminus, the invertebrate sequences have only one predicted hydrophobic stretch at the amino terminus. The shortest sequences are those of the bloodsucking insects (C. lectularius and the two sandflies, Lutzomia longipalpis and P. papatasi). No identities were observed with other nucleotide binding or hydrolyzing enzymes. To analyze the tissue distribution of the Ca2+-NDPase, polyadenylated RNA was purified from rat tissues and probed with a 726-bp antisense probe. Signals were obtained for all tissues analyzed, including intestine, thymus, heart, lung, spleen, kidney, liver, testis, skeletal muscle, and brain (Fig.3). Two major bands, whose preponderance considerably varied between tissues, were detected at 2.9 and 4.9 kb. Although in several tissues the 4.9-kb form predominated, the 2.9-kb signal was strong in lung, kidney, and brain. The 2.9-kb signal was absent from testis. An mRNA sequence of similar size (3.3 kb) was translated from a human cDNA library (BC017655). Transfection of CHO cells with either Myc-tagged full-length or truncated Ca2+-NDPase cDNA revealed that both cDNAs are expressed. Cells transfected with the empty plasmid served as a control. Membrane fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). After transfection with the full-length clone, a strong immunoreactive band of 49.3 kDa and a weak immunoreactive band of 46.8 kDa were obtained. The molecular mass of the truncated form (46.8 kDa) was identical to that of the weak band obtained after transfection with full-length cDNA. Because the predicted molecular mass of the tagged recombinant full-length protein is 49.6 kDa (untagged 45.7 KDa) and that of the tagged truncated form 46.2 kDa (untagged 42.3 KDa), it is likely that the third start codon is used to a minor extent for protein translation. No immunoreactive bands were obtained when the culture medium or the supernatant fractions obtained after homogenizing transfected cells were analyzed (data not shown). This suggests that no soluble and released form of the protein was generated. Catalytic activities were determined using membrane fractions obtained from CHO cells transfected with the untagged full-length or truncated cDNA or the empty plasmid (control). Transfection with either cDNA resulted in the formation of catalytically active enzymes with essentially identical substrate specificities and extents of product formation (Fig. 5). Both enzymes revealed highest activities with UDP, GDP, and IDP as substrates. Catalytic activity was very low with CDP as a substrate and absent with ADP. Nucleoside triphosphates were hydrolyzed to a small extent, with the highest catalytic activity obtained with UTP and GTP. Because commercially available nucleoside triphosphates can contain significant amounts of nucleoside diphosphates (8Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3282-3292Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 10Braun N. Fengler S. Ebeling C. Servos J. Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) it is possible that nucleoside diphosphates contributed to the apparent nucleoside triphosphatase activities determined. No hydrolysis was obtained with the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates. Dependence on divalent metal cations was determined using the full-length protein and UDP, the substrate yielding the highest catalytic activity (Fig. 6). Catalytic activity revealed a strict dependence on Ca2+. It was not activated by Mg2+ (Fig. 6 A). At a UDP concentration of 0.5 mm, maximum activity was obtained with 1 mm Ca2+. Higher Ca2+concentrations reduced catalytic activity. In the absence of added divalent cations and in the presence of 1 mm EDTA, catalytic activity amounted to 2.8% of maximal activity. Catalytic activity was max"
https://openalex.org/W2005542209,"The double-stranded (ds) RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) is a primary regulator of antiviral responses; however, the ability of dsRNA to activate nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and dsRNA + interferon γ (IFN-γ) to stimulate inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) expression by macrophages isolated from PKR−/− mice suggests that signaling pathways in addition to PKR participate in antiviral activities. We have identified a novel phospholipid-signaling cascade that mediates macrophage activation by dsRNA and viral infection. Bromoenol lactone (BEL), a selective inhibitor of the calcium-independent phospholipase A2 (iPLA2), prevents dsRNA- and virus-induced iNOS expression by RAW 264.7 cells and mouse macrophages. BEL does not modulate dsRNA-induced interleukin 1 expression, nor does it affect dsRNA-induced NF-κB activation. Protein kinase A (PKA) and the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) are downstream targets of iPLA2, because selective PKA inhibition prevents dsRNA-induced iNOS expression, and the inhibitory actions of BEL on dsRNA-induced iNOS expression are overcome by the direct activation of PKA. In addition, BEL inhibits dsRNA-induced CREB phosphorylation and CRE reporter activation. PKR does not participate in iPLA2 activation or iNOS expression, because dsRNA stimulates iPLA2 activity and dsRNA + IFN-γ induces iNOS expression and nitric oxide production to similar levels by macrophages isolated from PKR+/+ and PKR−/− mice. These findings support a PKR-independent signaling role for iPLA2 in the antiviral response of macrophages."

https://openalex.org/W2078502459,"S100A9, also referred to as MRP14, is a calcium-binding protein whose expression is tightly regulated during differentiation of myeloid cells. The present study was performed to study the cell type- and differentiation-specific transcriptional regulation of the S100A9 gene. Analysis of the S100A9 promoter in MonoMac-6 cells revealed evidence for a novel regulatory region from position −400 to −374 bp, termed myeloid-related protein regulatory element (MRE). MRE deletion resulted in a 5.2-fold reduction of promoter activity. By electrophoretic mobility shift analysis two nuclear complexes binding to this region were identified and referred to as MRE-binding complex A (MbcA) and MRE-binding complex B (MbcB). By mutagenesis the MRE-binding motif could be narrowed to a 12-bp region. The relevance of MRE is deduced from the observations that the formation of either MRE-binding complex A or MRE-binding complex B strongly correlated with S100A9 gene expression in a cell type-specific, activation- and differentiation-dependent manner. Moreover, DNA affinity chromatography and Western blot studies indicate that a Kruppel-related zinc finger protein and the transcriptional intermediary factor 1β (TIF1β) are involved in an MRE-binding complex, thereby regulating the S100A9 gene expression.

They originate from hematopoietic precursor cells in the bone marrow, and their lineage differentiation is coordinated by the closely regulated expression of cytokines, colony-stimulating factors, receptors, and transcription factors (for review, see Refs.1Ogawa M.

To study lineage differentiation several cell surface antigens, adhesion molecules (e.g. CD11b, CD18, CD64), and primary granule proteins (e.g. myeloperoxidase and neutrophil elastase) have been used as myeloid stage-specific markers. Additional interesting markers of myeloid differentiation represent the two myeloid-related proteins MRP8 (S100A8) and MRP14 (S100A9). Studies using human leukemia models of myelomonocytic development indicate that S100A8 and S100A9 expression is restricted to a specific stage of myeloid differentiation. Moreover, their expression is also regulated in mature blood cells because they are expressed in circulating neutrophils and monocytes but not in mature tissue macrophages (6Lagasse E. Clerc R.G.

These findings together with the presence of enhanced S100A8/A9 levels in sera from patients suffering from a number of inflammatory disorders (14Roth J. Teigelkamp S. Wilke M. Grun L. Tummler B. Sorg C. Immunobiology. 1992; 186: 304-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 15Goebeler M. Roth J. Burwinkel F. Vollmer E. Bocker W. Sorg C. Transplantation. 1994; 58: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Brun J.G. Jonsson R. Haga H.J. J. Rheumatol. 1994; 21: 733-738PubMed Google Scholar) have led to the assumption that S100A8 and S100A9 affect leukocyte trafficking and display a propagating role in inflammatory responses. The molecular mechanisms underlying the cell type-specific expression of S100A9 are unknown. The human S100A9 gene has been cloned and sequenced, and an upstream 1-kb fragment of its promoter was shown to drive the gene expression in myeloid cells (6Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). A number of distinct regulatory regions upstream of the transcription initiation site have been demonstrated to either activate or repress promoter activity in a differentiation and tissue/cell-specific manner. For example, two still unidentified factors were found to bind to the upstream regions of S100A9 gene during differentiation of HL-60 cells into monocyte-like cells; one adjacent to the TATA box and another in the region between −400 and −150 (17Kuwayama A. Kuruto R. Horie N. Takeishi K. Nozawa R. Blood. 1993; 81: 3116-3121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another study revealed a CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)1-binding motif located at position −81 upstream of the S100A9 gene. Both C/EBP-α and -β bind to this motif in a myeloid/monocytic differentiation-dependent manner (18Kuruto-Niwa R. Nakamura M. Takeishi K. Nozawa R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). C/EBP was shown to be sufficient alone to drive S100A9 expression in otherwise negative cells. C/EBP up-regulation is antagonized by myb, a transcription factor active in differentiated myeloid/monocytic cells (19Klempt M. Melkonyan H. Hofmann H.A. Eue I. Sorg C. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 148-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The presence of distinct epithelial and myeloid-specific regulatory regions upstream of the transcription initiation site has been demonstrated by detailed deletion analysis (20Klempt M. Melkonyan H. Hofmann H.A. Sorg C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Besides the very specific action of particular upstream DNA elements, the S100A9 gene contains a potent enhancer, which is harbored within positions 153–361 of its first intron (21Melkonyan H. Hofmann H.A. Nacken W. Sorg C. Klempt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27026-27032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of this enhancer in S100A9 expression is supported by its conservation in human and murine S100A9 genes at almost identical positions. The present study was performed to identify regulatory elements within the human S100A9 promoter that drive the cell type-specific and differentiation-dependent protein expression. We found a novel 27-bp region referred to as MRP regulatory element (MRE), which exhibits these characteristics. The functional relevance of this DNA regulatory region is shown by (i) the binding of two nuclear factors to the MRE by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis, and (ii) the finding that the formation of the nuclear protein complexes closely correlates with the myeloid-specific expression of the S100A9 gene. Further extensive investigations provide strong evidence that a complex of a Kruppel-related zinc finger protein and the transcriptional intermediary factor 1β (TIF1β) are involved in the regulation of the myeloid-specific S100A9 gene expression. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-human CD38 (clone T16), phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated anti-human CD33 (clone D3HL60.251), and FITC-conjugated anti-human CD15 (clone 80H5) were purchased from Beckman Coulter (Unterschleissheim, Germany). Allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated anti-human CD34 (clone 8G12), PE-conjugated anti-human CD11b (clone D12), and APC-conjugated anti-human CD14 (clone MoP9) were from BD PharMingen. Biotin-conjugated anti-human S100A9 (clone S32.2) was from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Mouse monoclonal C/EBPβ antibody (H7) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and the anti-chicken C/EBPα and C/EBPβ antibodies were kind gifts of Dr. Karl-Heinz Klempnauer (Institute of Biochemistry, University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany). The mouse monoclonal anti-TIF1β antibody was a kind gift of Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire Illkirch, Cedex, France). To investigate S100A9 gene expression during normal hematopoesis, bone marrow samples obtained to rule out systemic malignant disease (n = 4), to exclude bone marrow involvement in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma or sarcoma (n = 3), or to confirm continuous remission following chemotherapy for acute leukemia (n = 11) were analyzed by four-color flow cytometry. To analyze S100A9 expression at different stages of myeloid differentiation we used the antibody combinations of anti-CD38-FITC/anti-CD33-PE/anti-S100A9/anti-CD34-APC (immature cells) and anti-CD15-FITC/anti-CD11b-PE/anti-S100A9/anti-CD14-APC (mature myeloid cells). Approximately 3–5 × 106 non-separated bone marrow cells were first incubated for 15 min at room temperature with saturating amounts of the antibodies binding to myeloid differentiation markers on the cell surface. Subsequently, the cell membranes were treated with the Fix & Perm cell permeabilization kit (An-der-Grub, Kaumberg, Austria) according to the manufacturer's protocol to measure expression of intracellular S100A9. The cells were then incubated with biotinylated anti-human S100A9 antibody for 15 min at room temperature followed by incubation with streptavidin-PerCP. The cells were washed twice with phosphate buffered saline. Data acquisition and analysis was performed on a 2-laser (488 and 633 nm) FACSCalibur (BD PharMingen) using CellQuest and Paint-A-Gate-Pro software (BD PharMingen). For time delay calibration, APC beads (Calibrite APC, BD PharMingen) were applied according to the manufacturer's instructions. Isotype controls were included in all analyses. The human monocytic cell line MonoMac-6 (DSM ACC 124) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1 mmol/liter pyruvate, and 9 μg/ml bovine insulin (Sigma). The human histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937 (ACC 5) was cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The human B-lymphocytic cell line Raji, the fibroblast cell line l-132 (ATCC CCL5), and the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mmol/liter glutamine. Human peripheral blood monocytes and lymphocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Paque and Percoll density gradient centrifugation (Amersham Biosciences). Monocytes were cultured in Teflon bags for 1–7 days as described previously (22Mueller G. Kerkhoff C. Hankowitz J. Pataki M. Kovacs E. Lackner K.J. Schmitz G. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 1317-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Keratinocyte cultures were grown in serum-free keratinocyte growth medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.09 mmol/liter Ca2+ at 37 °C in a humid, 5% CO2atmosphere. The 1-kb upstream promoter fragment of the human S100A9 gene was inserted into theSmaI/BglII sites of the pCAT3-Basic vector (Promega) containing CAT as a reporter gene to generate pHH1.0T. A series of 5′-deletion constructs of the S100A9 promoter were prepared by digestion of pHH1.0T with KpnI and NheIfollowed by treatment with exonuclease III at 25 °C for 0.5–10 min, with subsequent S1-nuclease digestion and self-religation (all enzymes were from MBI-Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). The correct size of the 5′ untranslated region was confirmed by DNA sequencing. To generate the plasmid pHH400T, the vector pHH1.0T was digested using the restriction endonuclease SacI. The construct pHH763TΔ-400-(−374) was cloned by digestion of the pHH763T plasmid with SacI and partial digestion with NcoI to delete the 36 bp of the region from −400 to −364 bp. The herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (CLONTECH) was inserted into the pSP72 vector (Promega) to generate pTKC (21Melkonyan H. Hofmann H.A. Nacken W. Sorg C. Klempt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27026-27032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Additionally, the region from −400 to −378 bp of the S100A9-promoter was cloned 5′ to the pTKC construct (MRE-pTKC). Transfection was performed as described by Melkonyan et al. (23Melkonyan H. Sorg C. Klempt M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4356-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described (24Ciotti P. Van Dyke M.W. Bianchi-Scarra G. Musso M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). For the EMSA reaction, a double-stranded oligonucleotide encompassing nucleotides −400 to −357 of the S100A9 promoter was used. The sense oligonucleotide CAGACCATCCTTGTTGGACTAAAAGGAAGGGGCAGACTGCCATG and its antisense strand CATGGCAGTCTGCCCCTTCCTTTTAGTCCAACAAGGATGGTCTG were annealed and end-labeled by thyroxine polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (Hartmann Analytic, Braunschweig, Germany). EMSAs were performed with nuclear extracts as follows: nuclear protein (50 μg) was mixed with 3 μg of sheared genomic salmon sperm DNA and 100,000 cpm of the labeled probe (∼1 ng) in EMSA buffer (20 mmol/liter Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 75 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.018% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) in a total volume of 36 μl. In the competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of unlabelled competitor oligonucleotide was added to the mixture prior to the addition of nuclear protein extracts. This mixture was allowed to incubate for 60 min at 4 °C. Samples were mixed with 12 μl of sample buffer (50% (w/v) sucrose, 0.5 × Tris borate EDTA buffer (where 1 × Tris borate EDTA buffer is 90 mmol/liter Tris borate, 2 mmol/liter EDTA, pH 8.0) and then run on a non-denaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25 × Tris borate EDTA buffer. The gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 x-ray film. The biotinylated MRE oligonucleotides were synthesized by Applied Biosystems Oligo Factory (Weiterstadt, Germany). For DNA affinity purification, 0.5–2 mg of nuclear protein was incubated with 400 pmol double-stranded, biotinylated MRE oligonucleotide coupled to 500-μg magnetic beads via streptavidin (Dynal, Hamburg, Germany) and 100 μg of sheared genomic salmon sperm DNA in 1000 μl of EMSA-buffer. After rotating the samples for 1 h at 4 °C, the proteins bound to MRE beads were eluted with EMSA-buffer supplemented with 0, 100, 250, and 1,000 mm NaCl. Aliquots of the different fractions were analyzed by EMSA and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using standard protocols. Total cellular RNA was extracted from cells by the SDS-citric acid method of Dreier et al. (25Dreier J. Högger P. Sorg C. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The Northern blot analysis was performed using standard protocols. After DNA affinity chromatography the 1m NaCl eluate displaying DNA-binding activity was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were visualized by silver staining. The proteins were excised from the gel, digested with trypsin, and the peptide mixtures were extracted from the gel according to Shevchenkoet al. (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7832) Google Scholar) and Zhang et al. (27Zhang X. Herring C.J. Romano P.R. Szczepanowska J. Brzeska H. Hinnebusch A.G. Qin J. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2050-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, the gel slices were shrunk in acetonitrile, dried, and re-swollen in 20 μl of 50 mm NH4HCO3 containing 400 ng of trypsin. Excess trypsin solution was removed, sufficient buffer was added to cover the gel slices, and digestion was carried out at 37 °C overnight. Digestion was stopped by adding 5–10 μl of 100% acetic acid, and the supernatant was removed. The gel slices were extracted twice with 70 μl of acetonitrile, and the supernatants were pooled and lyophilized. The lyophilized peptides were dissolved in 7 μl of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid followed by hydrophobic chromatography using ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The peptides were eluted with 7 μl of 70% acetonitrile. Samples of 10 mg of α-cyano were washed with acetone and dissolved in 1 ml of 50/50 (v/v) acetonitrile/ethanol containing 1% of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. Then, 0.7 μl of this matrix preparation was spotted onto the target followed by the same volume of sample. Both solutions were directly mixed on the target. MALDI-mass spectrometry was carried out using a TofSpec-2E instrument (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Digests were run in positive ion reflection mode using a matrix suppression of 500. Masses were externally calibrated and internally corrected using either the lock mass option of the instrument or trypsin autolysis peaks providing m/z values >50 ppm up to m/z 3000. The resulting spectra were analyzed by homology search using Swissprot and NCBI. The expression of S100A9 appears to be restricted to a specific stage of myeloid differentiation because the protein is expressed in circulating neutrophils and monocytes but not in mature tissue macrophages. In peripheral blood monocytes its expression is down-regulated during maturation to macrophages (6Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 7Zwadlo G. Bruggen J. Gerhards G. Schlegel R. Sorg C. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1988; 72: 510-515PubMed Google Scholar). In the past, several investigators had used various human promyelocytic leukemia cell lines, such as HL-60, U937, and MonoMac-6 cells, as cellular models to study differentiation-dependent S100A9 gene expression (6Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 18Kuruto-Niwa R. Nakamura M. Takeishi K. Nozawa R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar,28van Roozendaal K.E. Darling D. Farzaneh F. Exp. Cell Res. 1990; 190: 137-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). However, less is known about S100A9 gene expression during the differentiation of human hematopoietic cells. Therefore, we investigated S100A9 expression during normal hematopoiesis using four-color flow cytometry of human bone marrow. Immature cells were distinguished from more mature myeloid cells by staining for either CD38, CD33, and CD34 (immature cells) or CD15, CD11b, and CD14 (mature myeloid cells) that reflect different stages of myeloid differentiation (29Terstappen L.W. Safford M. Loken M.R. Leukemia. 1990; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar, 30Terstappen L.W. Buescher S. Nguyen M. Reading C. Leukemia. 1992; 6: 1001-1010PubMed Google Scholar). Primitive hematopoietic cells express the progenitor antigen CD34 but lack expression of CD38 or any lineage-specific markers. With differentiation toward the myeloid lineage, immature progenitor cells acquire expression of the myeloid antigen CD33 followed by down-regulation of CD34. As shown in Fig.1, primitive, uncommitted CD34+CD38−CD33− (data not shown) and early myeloid CD34+CD33+ progenitor cells lack expression of S100A9 (Fig. 1, green events, upper right dot blot). During neutrophil maturation, S100A9 is only detectable in cells that already express CD15, but S100A9 expression slightly precedes and then correlates with the up-regulation of CD11b (Fig. 1, blue cells, lower left and right dot blots). Mature CD15+CD16+CD33+ neutrophils are also S100A9-positive (data not shown). Other lineages, including CD19+ B-cells, CD3+ T-cells, and glycophorin A-positive erythroid cells, did not express S100A9 (data not shown). The acquisition of CD15 (Lewis x antigen) marks the transition from myeloblasts to promyelocytes and the up-regulation of the αM-integrin CD11b differentiation of promyelocytes to myelocytes (29Terstappen L.W. Safford M. Loken M.R. Leukemia. 1990; 4: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, the expression of S100A9 is first initiated during maturation of promyelocytes toward myelocytes and then maintained up to the level of mature neutrophils. Within the monocytic pathway, up-regulation of CD11b precedes acquisition of intermediate expression of CD15. The up-regulation of S100A9 correlates with the expression of CD11b (Fig. 1, red events, lower left blot) and CD14 (data not shown). In contrast to neutrophil development, in monocytes S100A9 expression precedes up-regulation of CD15 (Fig. 1, red events,lower right blot). Thus, during both neutrophil and monocyte development the up-regulation of S100A9 correlates with the acquisition of CD11b. However, due to the differential expression of CD15 in both cell lineages, S100A9 expression precedes acquisition of CD15 in the monocytic pathway and succeeds CD15 expression during neutrophil maturation. This flow cytometric characterization shows for the first time that S100A9 expression is tightly regulated in a differentiation- and lineage-specific manner within the hematopoietic system. Note that our study clearly indicates that the S100A9 protein also represents a myeloid stage-specific marker. Due to the differentiation- and lineage-dependent expression of S100A9, we investigated the transcriptional regulation of the human S100A9 gene. MonoMac-6 cells were transfected with various S100A9 promoter constructs containing CAT as a reporter gene. The promoter constructs used in this functional analysis were a 1-kb fragment from position −1,000 extending to the transcriptional start side and various deletions of this fragment generated by exonuclease digestions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This 1-kb proximal region has been found to be sufficient to drive lineage-specific expression of the S100A9 gene (6Lagasse E. Clerc R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2402-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar,21Melkonyan H. Hofmann H.A. Nacken W. Sorg C. Klempt M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27026-27032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mean transcriptional activities of the deletion constructs were normalized to the mean activity of the 1-kb fragment. As shown in Fig. 2, regions of both positive and negative regulation were present within the 1-kb fragment. The construct pHH153T was sufficient to drive S100A9 gene expression in MonoMac-6 cells, indicating that this region might represent a minimal promoter. The construct pHH763T had a 1.7-fold increase in CAT activity compared with the basic promoter construct pHH1.0T. Subsequent deletions to position −400 bp (pHH533T, pHH520T, pHH432T, and pHH400T) only slightly affected the relative transcriptional activity. However, deletion of the region from −400 to −374 bp (promoter construct pHH374T) resulted in a remarkable reduction of the relative transcriptional activity compared with pHH763T (5.2-fold). To verify the relevance of this 27-bp region for the transcriptional regulation of the S100A9 gene, we generated a promoter construct of pHH763T in which the 27-bp region was deleted. Fortunately, the S100A9 promoter adjacent to the region from −400 to −374 bp contained upstream and downstream recognition sites of SacI andNcoI. The pHH763T construct was digested with these two endonucleases as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the resulting promoter construct pHH763TΔ-400-(−356) was transiently transfected into MonoMac-6 cells. The mean activity of the deletion construct was normalized to the mean activity of the pHH763T construct. The pHH763TΔ-400-(−356) construct exhibited a relative transcriptional activity similar to the pHH374T construct (Fig.3), indicating that the 27-bp region may represent a strong positive regulatory element. We therefore termed this region MRP (myeloid-related protein) regulatory element (MRE). Further functional analysis of the MRE was performed by cloning the MRE adjacent to the heterologous herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter (pTKC). The promoter constructs MRE-pTKC as well as pTKC were transiently transfected into either MonoMac-6 or U937 cells (Fig.4). The relative transcriptional activity of MRE-pTKC was slightly increased in MonoMac-6 compared with pTKC, indicating that MRE does not function as a context-independent enhancer element. In the human monocytic cell line U937 the MRE-pTKC construct resulted in a strong decrease (7.2-fold) of the relative transcriptional activity compared with pTKC (Fig. 3 B). To estimate this result we performed Northern blot analysis of U937 cells and found that U937 cells did not express S100A9 (data not shown). This result is in accordance with another study (18Kuruto-Niwa R. Nakamura M. Takeishi K. Nozawa R. Cell Struct. Funct. 1998; 23: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, we suggested that MRE behaves as a strong negative regulatory element in S100A9-negative cells. Next, EMSA was performed to analyze the nuclear proteins binding to the region from −400 to −357 bp, thereby using nuclear extracts prepared from MonoMac-6 cells and U937 cells. As shown in Fig.5, in both nuclear extracts DNA-protein complexes were formed. The binding of proteins to MRE was specific, as an excess of non-labeled MRE oligonucleotide efficiently competed with the labeled probe in complex formation, whereas an unrelated double-stranded oligonucleotide probe did not compete. However, the resulting DNA-protein complexes in the nuclear extracts of either MonoMac-6 or U937 cells showed different electrophoretic mobilities. The complex exhibiting slower electrophoretic mobility is referred to as MRE-binding complex A (MbcA) and the other complex as MbcB, respectively. For control, we performed analogous EMSA analysis with nuclear extracts of human blood monocytes (S100A9-positive) and human blood lymphocytes (S100A9-negative). The results were very similar for MonoMac-6 cells and the human blood monocytes, and DNA-protein complexes with similar electrophoretic mobilities were detected. Incubation of the probe with nuclear extracts from human blood lymphocytes resulted in the formation of a complex with a similar electrophoretic mobility to the complex formed in U937 cells (data not shown). Therefore, we assume a correlation between S100A9 protein expression and binding of the different protein complexes to the MRE driving the gene expression within these cells. Based on our findings, the complex MbcB presumably drives S100A9 gene expression, whereas MbcA might have a negative regulatory role. To characterize the binding site of the nuclear proteins, first various double-stranded DNA probes with overlapping and flanking sequences to the region from −400 to −357 bp were synthesized and used as cold competitors in EMSA analysis of nuclear extracts of monocytes. The results are summarized in Fig. 6. The competition analysis of MRE binding revealed that most likely the subregion from −400 t"
https://openalex.org/W2125249931,"We have previously shown that the zymogen factor XI (FXI) binds to activated platelets but not to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), a conclusion that is in conflict with previous reports stating that FXI binds to 2.7–13 × 106 high affinity sites per HUVEC (Berrettini, M., Schleef, R. R., Heeb, M. J., Hopmeier, P., and Griffin, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19833–19839; Shariat-Madar, Z., Mahdi, F., and Schmaier, A. H. (2001)Thromb. Haemostasis 85, 544–551). It has also been reported that activated FXI (FXIa) binds to 1.5 × 106sites per HUVEC and promotes the activation of factor IX by cell bound FXIa (Berrettini, M., Schleef, R. R., Heeb, M. J., Hopmeier, P., and Griffin, J. H. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 19833–19839). Therefore, the binding of FXIa to activated platelets was compared with FXIa binding to HUVEC and HEK293 cells immobilized on microcarrier beads. Specific and saturable zinc-dependent FXIa binding was demonstrated to 250 ± 48 sites per activated platelet (K D = 1.7 ± 0.78 nm) and 6.5 ± 0.4 × 104 sites per HUVEC (K D = 2.4 ± 0.5 nm), whereas no binding to HEK293 cells was detected. A titration with high molecular weight kininogen had no effect on FXIa binding to platelets, but revealed a concentration-dependent decrease in the amount of FXIa bound to HUVEC. The rate of factor IXa generation catalyzed by FXIa was unaffected by the presence of surfaces; however only the activated platelet surface protected FXIa from inhibition by protease nexin 2. The results presented here confirm the conclusion that activated platelets are procoagulant while unstimulated endothelial cells are not.

Broze Jr., G.J. Science. 1991; 253: 909-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). The activation of FXI to FXIa requires the presence of a negatively charged surface, which under physiological conditions is provided by activated platelets (4Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The binding of FXI to platelets (and also to heparin) is mediated by the Apple 3 domain of FXI (5Ho D.H. Badellino K. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16382-16390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 6Ho D.H. Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31153-31159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), whereas the binding of FXIa to heparin occurs solely through a cysteine constrained loop within the catalytic domain (8Badellino K.O. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7569-7580Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The FXIa domain that mediates its binding to activated platelets has not been identified. The natural substrate for FXIa is factor IX (FIX), which is activated to FIXa, the enzyme component of the FX activating complex on activated platelets (9Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 10Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The homodimeric nature of FXIa is thought to be necessary for the simultaneous binding of the enzyme to the activated platelet surface, mediated through one subunit and the binding of FIX by the second subunit (11Gailani D., Ho, D. Sun M.F. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3117-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the activation of FIX, through proteolytic cleavage resulting in the release of the activation peptide by FXIa on activated platelets, may require the active sites of both subunits because monomer FXIa can activate FIX only in solution, not in the presence of activated platelets (11Gailani D., Ho, D. Sun M.F. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3117-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FIX is activated by hydrolysis of two scissile bonds without release of an intermediate (12Wolberg A.S. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4074-4079Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The substrate binding site for FIX within FXIa has been postulated to reside within the Apple 2 domain from studies utilizing small peptide competition, whereas studies with chimeric proteins suggest that this site resides within the Apple 3 domain (13Baglia F.A. Jameson B.A. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24190-24197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Sun M.F. Zhao M. Gailani D. J. Biol.

FXIa binds with high affinity (K D ∼3.25 nm) to ∼225 sites on the activated platelet surface (18Sinha D. Walsh P.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar,19Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Binding of FXIa to activated platelets was shown to require the presence of high molecular weight kininogen (HK), but the rates of FIX activation in the presence and absence of activated platelets were similar (18Sinha D. Walsh P.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, 19Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin.

Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar) and FIX (10Ahmad S.S. Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to the platelet surface do not increase rates of FIX activation or alternatively that an actual rate enhancement is obscured by simultaneous inhibition of FXIa by protease nexin 2 (PN2) secreted from platelets (20Van Nostrand W.E.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that FXIa binds with high affinity (K D ∼1.5 nm) to sites (∼1.5 × 106 per cell) exposed on unstimulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of FXIa to unactivated HUVEC was reported to require the presence of both HK and zinc ions, and HUVEC-bound FXIa was reported to activate FIX at reduced rates compared with solution phase FIX activation (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we have addressed the question of whether the initiation of the consolidation phase of blood coagulation occurs on platelets or on endothelium, since it had previously been shown that zymogen FXI binds both to activated platelets (∼1500 sites/platelets,K D ∼10 nm) (4Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and to unactivated HUVEC (2.7–13 × 106 sites/cell;K D = 4.5–6.9 nm) (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We demonstrated (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) that the reported interaction of FXI with resting HUVEC represented an artifact of the binding assay carried out in microtiter wells (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). During the course of these previous studies we developed an assay for examining the binding of FXI to HUVEC cultured on collagen-coated microcarrier beads, permitting direct comparison with FXI binding to activated platelets (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized this assay (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) to examine the binding of FXIa to both platelets and HUVEC. We have confirmed that FXIa binds specifically and reversibly with high affinity to sites that are distinct from FXI on both platelets and HUVEC. The binding of FXIa to HUVEC is unlikely to occur physiologically, since plasma concentrations of HK abrogate FXIa binding to HUVEC. Furthermore, the rate of FIX activation by FXIa is not enhanced by physiological surfaces; however, the activated platelet surface protects the catalytic activity of FXIa from inhibition by PN2. This report supports the hypothesis that the activated platelet surface is procoagulant and the endothelium is non-thrombogenic. FXIIa, FXIa, FXI, FIX, FIXa, FX, FXa, prekallikrein, kallikrein, and goat anti-human FXIIa IgG (α-FXIIa) were purchased from Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). HK and thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). PN2 was a kind gift from Dr. William Van Nostrand, State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY. The thrombin receptor activation peptide (TRAP, SFLLRN-amide) was synthesized at the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania (Dr. John Lambris, Director). 125I-FXIa was prepared by the activation of radiolabeled FXI. FXI was radiolabeled with 125I using the IODO-GEN method (27Tuszynski G.P. Knight L. Piperno J.R. Walsh P.N. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Approximately 100 μg of protein was incubated with 1 mCi of carrier-free Na125I (Amersham Biosciences) for 20 min in an IODO-GEN-coated vial and centrifuged through a 1-cc Sephadex G-50 packed spin column at 200 × g for 5 min to separate 125I-bound protein from free 125I.125I-FXI was incubated with FXIIa (20:1 molar ratio) for 4 h at 37 °C. FXIIa was removed by incubation with α-FXIIa linked to agarose beads for 1 h at 37 °C. The antibody-linked agarose beads were generated by incubation with CNBr-activated Sepharose (1 g, Sigma) in 0.001 n HCl. The antibody α-FXIIa was diluted to 1 mg/ml in sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH = 8.3) and an equal volume of beads was added overnight at 4 °C with constant stirring. Ethanolamine (1 M final concentration) was added to the reaction mixture for 2 h with constant stirring. The resin was then washed three times in alternating sodium acetate and sodium bicarbonate. Optical density was measured for each eluate wash for the absorbance at wavelength 280 nm to detect non-cross-linked antibody. The resin was stored at 4 °C in sodium bicarbonate buffer with 0.03% sodium azide. After final purification and removal of FXIIa125I-FXIa was visualized using SDS-PAGE analysis for the appearance of the 30- and 50-kDa enzyme bands under reducing conditions. Specific radioactivity (1.1 × 108cpm/mol) and biological activity (246 units/mg) were determined as reported previously (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The substrate pyro-Glu-Pro-Arg-pNA (S-2366, Chromogenix, Môlndal, Sweden) was used to determine FXIa activity. The rate of cleavage of S-2366 (250 μm) was determined by the absorbance at 405 nm and compared with a standard curve generated from FXIa. Normal pooled HUVEC were purchased from Cascade Biologicals (Portland, OR) and cultured in low serum growth supplement (2% fetal bovine serum) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Medium was changed after 24 h and then on alternate days until the cells reached confluence. Cells were passaged and no longer used after the fifth passage. Cells (1 × 106 passage 1) were frozen in 1 ml of Me2SO Freeze buffer and stored in liquid nitrogen. HEK293 cells and Chinese hamster ovary cells were cultured similarly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. HUVEC or HEK293 cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were added to 5 ml (1.5 × 105 beads) of swelled Cytodex-3 collagen-coated microcarrier beads (Amersham Biosciences) that were washed in complete endothelial cell media. After 30 min at room temperature the beads and cells were transferred to a spinner flask (Wheaton Scientific, Millville, NJ) and incubated under constant stirring (60 rpm) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Microcarrier bead cultures (0.5 ml) were mixed with 0.5 ml of trypan blue (Invitrogen) to determine the extent of confluence, since the microcarrier beads, but not cell-coated beads, retained trypan blue staining (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Platelets were prepared as described (28Walsh P.N. Mills D.C. White J.G. Br. J. Haematol. 1977; 36: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 29Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Briefly, platelets were obtained from platelet rich plasma after centrifugation of whole blood collected into acid-citrate-dextrose. Platelet-rich plasma was centrifuged through a bovine serum albumin (BSA) gradient and gel-filtered through a 50-ml Sepharose 2B column. Platelet eluates were counted electronically using a particle counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL) and then washed in 10 mm Hepes containing 5 mm EDTA once, and three times in 10 mm Hepes buffer without EDTA. Activation of platelets was measured by shape change, aggregation, and release of ADP using a Lumi-Aggregometer (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA). To eliminate the effect of FXIa binding to an artificial surface, HUVEC were cultured in suspension on microcarrier beads, and binding was measured using a procedure similar to that previously described for platelets (29Scandura J.M. Ahmad S.S. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8890-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HUVEC or HEK293 cells grown to confluence on microcarrier beads were washed and resuspended in incubation buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.138 m NaCl, 100 μm ZnCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 0.5% BSA (pH = 7.35)) to a density of 106 cells/ml. Platelets (108/ml) were incubated with 25 μmTRAP in incubation buffer. Silicone oil (15 μl, DC500:DC200, 4:1) was centrifuged to the bottom of a 200-μl microcentrifuge tube with a narrow bore tip (Sarstedt, Inc., Princeton, NJ). The cell suspension was added to the radiolabeled protein mixture (50 μl each) and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with shaking by hand every 15 min. To separate the bound from free protein, tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min in a vertical centrifuge (model B, Beckman Instruments, Inc., Cedar Grove, NJ). The tubes were placed in dry ice/ethanol slurry for 5 min, and the tips of the microtubes were amputated. Both the pellets (cell-bound proteins) and 10 μl of the supernatant (free protein) were measured for γ-emission. FXIa (2 nm) was incubated in Hepes Tyrodes Buffer (126 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.38 mmNaH2PO4, 5.6 mm dextrose, 5.8 mm Hepes, 9.2 mm Hepes-free acid, pH = 7.3) alone supplemented with CaCl2 (5 mm) and ZnCl2 (25 μm) or with gel-filtered platelets (3 × 108 platelets/ml) or HUVEC-coated microcarrier beads (1 × 106 cells/ml) in a final volume of 100 μl for 5 min at 37 °C. In some cases, TRAP (25 μm) was included in the reaction. In other cases, PN2 (20 nm) was then added to the reaction mixture five minutes prior to the addition of FIX (1 μm). Aliquots (10 μl) were removed at different time points and placed into an equal volume of reduced sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and resolved on 4–20% Tris-Tricine gradient gels (Bio-Rad) by SDS-PAGE analysis. Gels and nitrocellulose membranes (0.2 μm pore size, Schleicher & Scheull, Inc.) were soaked in Towbin's Buffer (12.5 mm Tris-OH, 192 mm glycine, 20% MeOH) prior to semidry electrotransfer. Nitrocellulose membranes were dried and washed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBST). Membranes were blocked with 3% BSA in PBST overnight. Goat anti-human FIX polyclonal antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) was diluted 1:2000 in PBST containing 1% BSA and added to the membranes for 1.5 h. After three washes in PBST, a 1:20,000 dilution of the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody in PBST with 1% BSA was added to the membranes for 30 min. The FIX migration pattern was detected on the membranes using the Supersignal West Picochemiluminesent Substrate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's suggestions and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak Eastman). Densitometry was performed using Un-Scan-It software (Silk Scientific, Inc., Orem, UT). Either HUVEC grown to confluence on microcarrier beads or platelets isolated from fresh whole blood and activated with the thrombin receptor (PAR1) activation peptide (SFLLRN-amide or TRAP) were incubated with increasing concentrations of 125I-FXIa. After centrifugation through silicone oil and separation of cell-bound from free protein, binding curves were generated as shown in Fig. 1. Specific and saturable binding was detected to both platelets (Fig.1 A) and HUVEC, but not HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 B). Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding (i.e. the amount of 125I-FXIa not displaced by a 100-fold molar excess of non-labeled FXIa) from the total amount of125I-FXIa bound. FXIa binds to 250 ± 48 high affinity sites per platelet (K D = 1.7 ± 0.78 nm) and to 6.5 ± 0.4 × 104 high affinity sites per HUVEC (K D = 2.4 ± 0.5 nm). Both studies were carried out in the presence of 2 mm calcium ions and 25 μm zinc ions (divalent metal concentrations determined to be optimal for FXI binding to platelets (4Greengard J.S. Heeb M.J. Ersdal E. Walsh P.N. Griffin J.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3884-3890Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 25Baglia F.A. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2271-2281Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) but in the absence of HK). No binding sites were detected on either HUVEC or platelets when experiments were performed in the absence of zinc ions (data not shown). HK had previously been reported to be essential in the binding of FXIa to both HUVEC (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and activated platelets (18Sinha D. Walsh P.N. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar,19Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); however, we were able to detect binding sites on both activated platelets and HUVEC in the absence of HK (Fig. 1). To examine the role of HK in the binding of FXIa to both activated platelets and HUVEC, HK was titrated into the binding reaction. A saturating concentration of FXIa (5 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of HK in the presence of zinc ions (25 μm) and either TRAP-activated platelets (Fig.2 A) or HUVEC (Fig.2 B). FXIa binding to activated platelets was unaffected by the presence of HK. In contrast, increasing concentrations of HK decreased the amount of FXIa bound to HUVEC, suggesting that under physiological conditions, FXIa would not bind to HUVEC. To determine the specificity of FXIa binding to both the activated platelets and to the HUVEC surface, we attempted to compete FXIa binding sites from the surface of platelets and HUVEC using different proteins at 100× molar excess (Fig. 3). The FXIa receptor on platelets is distinct from that of the FXI receptor, because FXI was incapable of displacing FXIa. Furthermore, FXI did not displace FXIa binding to HUVEC, most likely because there are no FXI binding sites on HUVEC (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The proteins, prekallikrein, FIX, and the IgG α-FXII, were also incapable of displacing FXIa binding to either HUVEC or platelets, as were the enzymes, kallikrein, FIXa, and FXa. The presence of HK did not have any effect on the binding of FXIa to platelets, but did reduce the binding of FXIa to HUVEC 83%, confirming the results in Fig. 2. We conclude from these experiments that FXIa binds specifically to both platelets and HUVEC and that FXIa binding to HUVEC is almost completely abrogated in the presence of HK at physiological concentrations. The activation of FIX by FXIa is the only reaction within the intrinsic or consolidation phase of the coagulation cascade where the rate appears to be unaffected by the presence of the activated platelet surface (9Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Gailani D., Ho, D. Sun M.F. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N. Blood. 2001; 97: 3117-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 30Walsh P.N. Sinha D. Koshy A. Seaman F.S. Bradford H. Blood. 1986; 68: 225-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Mannhalter C.

However, evidence exists that suggests activated platelets protect the activity of FXIa from inactivation by protease inhibitors (34Walsh P.N. Sinha D. Kueppers F. Seaman F.S. Blankstein K.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1578-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) including PN2, which is secreted from activated platelets (22Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To elucidate the role of both platelets and HUVEC in the activation of FIX by FXIa, studies were performed in the presence and absence of PN2 (Fig.4). In the presence of platelets (Fig. 4,B and C), HUVEC (Fig. 4, D andE) or a buffer control (Fig. 4 A), no change was observed in rate of FIXa formation in the absence of PN2. The activation of FIX by FXIa was virtually completely inhibited by PN2 in solution or in the presence of unstimulated platelets and HUVEC (Fig.4, A and B–E). However, in the presence of activated platelets, the activation of FIX by FXIa was preserved in the presence of exogenously added PN2 (Fig. 4 B). Thus the activated platelet surface had little or no direct effect on the rate of FIX activation by FXIa and the reaction proceeded at uninhibited rates when PN2 was present. In contrast, FXIa-catalyzed FIX activation was completely inhibited by PN2 in solution or in the presence of HUVEC. The central biological question addressed by the present studies relates to the identification of the cellular locus of coagulation reactions involved in the initiation of the consolidation phase of blood coagulation. Cellular surfaces have previously been suggested to participate in this important physiological process by binding coagulation FXI, promoting its proteolytic activation, binding the enzyme, FXIa, and facilitating the activation of FIX to FIXa and subsequent coagulation reactions leading to generation of sufficient amounts of thrombin to effect normal hemostasis. Two of these cellular surfaces are the surface membranes of activated platelets (35Walsh P.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and resting endothelial cells (23Berrettini M. Schleef R.R. Heeb M.J. Hopmeier P. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19833-19839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Shariat-Madar Z. Mahdi F. Schmaier A.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 544-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We have previously compared these two cellular surfaces for their capacity to bind FXI and promote its activation to FXIa (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). This comparison required the development of a novel method for immobilizing endothelial cells (HUVEC) on microcarrier beads because of the very high level of nonspecific binding of HK to microtiter plates that resulted in the artifactual appearance of a very large number of FXI binding sites originally, which were erroneously interpreted as FXI receptors on resting endothelial cells (23Berrettini M.

Our studies demonstrated that activated platelets exposed a discrete number of saturable, specific, high affinity FXI binding sites and promoted the activation of FXI preferentially by thrombin (24Baird T.R.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20514-20519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast HUVEC, either in the resting state or after activation with thrombin or the thrombin receptor (PAR1) activation peptide (SFLLRN-amide), were unable to bind FXI (24Baird T.R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28498-28503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FXIa binding to activated platelets did not require the presence of added HK (Figs. 1 A and 2 A). This result differs from a previous report of studies carried out in the absence of added zinc ions that demonstrated a requirement for added HK to promote FXIa binding to activated platelets (19Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). HK that is bound to platelets either from plasma or released from platelets may explain this discrepancy. HK did, however, abrogate the binding of FXIa to HUVEC (but not activated platelets, Fig. 2 A) in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). FXIa and HK may compete for the same receptor on HUVEC; proposed HK receptors include the uPAR, C1qR, cytokeratin-1 receptor complex (38Colman R.W. Pixley R.A. Najamunnisa S. Yan W. Wang J. Mazar A.

Chem. 2000; 275: 33688-33696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Another potential explanation is that HK does not compete with FXIa for the same binding site, but rather the FXIa/HK complex remains sequestered in solution and does not associate with the HUVEC surface. It can be concluded from these observations that under physiological conditionsin vivo, where the concentration of HK in blood plasma is ∼650 nm, FXIa would fail to bind to HUVEC, but would bind to the surface of activated platelets. The presence of the activated platelet surface in both the thrombin-generating and FXa-generating complexes increases the overall catalytic efficiency by many orders of magnitude. In contrast, the rate of FIX activation by FXIa is unaffected by the presence of activated platelets or phospholipids (9Di Scipio R.G. Kurachi K. Davie E.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1528-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 11Gailani D., Ho, D. Sun M.F. Cheng Q. Walsh P.N.

Rawala-Sheikh R. Walsh P.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 3244-3251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Sinha D. Seaman F.S. Koshy A. Knight L.C. Walsh P.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 73: 1550-1556Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The fact that activated platelets release protease inhibitors such as PN2, which potently inhibits FXIa (K i ∼ 500 pm) (20Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cines D.B. Cunningham D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 43Van Nostrand W.E. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 43-53Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) suggests that the activated platelet surface could theoretically increase the rate of FIX activation and simultaneously, through the release of PN2, inhibit FXIa, thereby limiting the detection of an increased rate of FIXa generation. Studies by Scandura et al. (22Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) using a small florescent peptide substrate (BOC-EAR-AMC) determined that activated platelets release 1–1.5 nm PN2/108 platelets and that in the presence of HK the surface of activated platelets protects FXIa from inactivation. Platelets activated by TRAP secreted enough PN2 to significantly inhibit low concentrations of FXIa (25 pm) (22Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar); however, this does not represent FXIa bound to activated platelets, because FXIa was used at a concentration 70-fold lower than the K D (∼1.7 nm). We tested the ability of both platelets and HUVEC to promote the activation of the physiological substrate for FXIa, FIX, in the presence and absence of PN2 utilizing a FXIa concentration (2 nm) approximating the equilibrium dissociation constant that allows for the maximum number of FXIa molecules to be bound to the surface, compared with the number of FXIa molecules free in solution (i.e. ∼50%). Since there are no substrates available that are specific for FIXa and not FXIa, we detected FIXa generation using Western blot analysis (Fig. 4). Using this method we were unable to detect an increase in rate of FIXa formation over that found in solution, regardless of the presence of surface. Exogenously added PN2 inhibited the formation of FIXa unless platelets pretreated with TRAP were added to the reaction. TRAP-activated platelets (3 × 108/ml) have been shown to secrete 3–5 nm PN2 into solution (22Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and possibly as much as 30 nm PN2 (20Van Nostrand W.E. Schmaier A.H. Farrow J.S. Cines D.B. Cunningham D.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the rate of FIX activation by FXIa was virtually identical in solution (Fig.4 A) and in the presence of activated platelets (Fig.4 C) in our experiments. Since FXIa contains two active sites a 2-fold molar excess of PN2 is required for complete inactivation of FXIa (22Scandura J.M. Zhang Y. Van Nostrand W.E. Walsh P.N. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 412-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, when a 10-fold molar excess of PN2 to FXIa was present, TRAP-activated platelets supported FXIa-catalyzed FIX activation at rates identical to those observed in the absence of PN2 (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, in the presence of HUVEC, PN2 completely abrogated FXIa-catalyzed FIX activation (Fig. 4,D and E). We conclude that activated platelets, but not endothelial cells, protect FXIa from inactivation by PN2. Thus whereas neither the platelet nor the endothelial cell membrane increases the rate of FIX activation, the activated platelet promotes the initiation of the consolidation phase of blood coagulation by providing a protective nidus for FXIa-catalyzed FIX activation. By secreting PN2, activated platelets promote the inactivation of FXIa in solution and localize subsequent coagulation reactions to the platelet hemostatic thrombus. These observations are consistent with the concept that the primary phenotype of the endothelium is anticoagulant and non-thrombogenic, whereas the major function of activated (but not resting) platelets is to participate in the initiation of the consolidation pathway of blood coagulation leading to the local explosive generation of thrombin at sites of vascular injury."

Here, wild-type and single- and double-knockout nuclear extracts from the 14-3-3 Saccharomyces cerevisiaehomologues Bmh1p and Bmh2p were analyzed for similar cruciform-binding activities in relation to these proteins. The Bmh1p-Bmh2p heterodimer, present in the wild-type strain, bound efficiently to cruciform-containing DNA in a structure-specific manner because cruciform DNA efficiently competed with the formation of the complex, whereas linear DNA did not. In contrast, the band-shift ability of the Bmh1p-Bmh1p and Bmh2p-Bmh2p homodimers present in thebmh2 − and bmh1 −single-knockout cells, respectively, was reduced by ∼93 and 82%, respectively. The 14-3-3 plant homologue GF14 was also able to bind to cruciform DNA, suggesting that cruciform-binding activity is a common feature of the family of 14-3-3 proteins across species. Bmh1p and Bmh2p were found to associate in vivo with the yeast autonomous replication sequence ARS307, as assayed by formaldehyde cross-linking, followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-Bmh1p/Bmh2p antibody and conventional PCR. In agreement with the finding of an association of Bmh1p and Bmh2p with ARS307, another immunoprecipitation experiment using 2D3, an anti-cruciform DNA monoclonal antibody, revealed the presence of cruciform-containing DNA in ARS307.

The family is represented by a group of highly homologous proteins (isoforms) encoded by separate genes. The number of isoforms range from 12 in Arabidopsis thaliana (2Rosenquist M. Sehnke P.

Involvement of 14-3-3 proteins in important biological processes such as apoptosis, signal transduction, and the cell cycle has been well documented (for review, see Ref. 17Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). Although there is a large list of binding partners (currently >50 signaling proteins) (17Fu H. Subramanian R.R. Masters S.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 617-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar), functional studies of 14-3-3 proteins are incomplete. Previously, we identified and characterized a cruciform DNA-binding protein (CBP)1 in HeLa cells (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 19Pearson C.E. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Zorbas H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1571-1580Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Microsequence analysis of three tryptic peptides of CBP revealed 100% homology to the 14-3-3 family of proteins (15Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which in turn revealed a novel activity associated with 14-3-3 proteins, namely the binding to cruciform-containing DNA. Because cruciforms have been implicated in the initiation of DNA replication in prokaryotic plasmids (20Lin L.-S. Meyer R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8319-8331Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Noirot P. Bargonetti J. Novick R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Virol. 1992; 66: 674-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and mammalian cells (24Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Frappier L. Khoury M. Price G.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), the cruciform-binding activity of 14-3-3 proteins represents a new direction in the study of these multifunctional proteins. Furthermore, in recent studies, we have found that several 14-3-3 isoforms (ε, β, γ, and ζ) associate in vivo with origins of DNA replication in a cell cycle-dependent manner and are involved in DNA replication (25Novac O. Alvarez D. Pearson C.E. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11174-11183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In view of the strong conservation of the 14-3-3 proteins not only with respect to sequence, but also to function, data obtained in yeast would have great relevance for the higher eukaryotic systems. The use of the powerful genetic and biochemical techniques available for S. cerevisiae should advance our knowledge of the role of 14-3-3 proteins in cruciform binding and eukaryotic DNA replication. To investigate whether the cruciform-binding activity of 14-3-3 found in mammalian cells is also present in yeast, we analyzed the 14-3-3S. cerevisiae homologues Bmh1p and Bmh2p by electrophoretic mobility shift assays or band-shift assays. S. cerevisiaewas used as a model yeast system because DNA replication is better characterized in it by comparison with the fission yeast S. pombe. Bmh1p and Bmh2p, like their mammalian counterparts, are involved in interactions with a large number of proteins that are important in intracellular regulatory processes (for review, see Ref.26van Hemert M.J. van Heusden G.P.H. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These two proteins are >60% identical to the mammalian 14-3-3ε isoform, and except for the C-terminal amino acids, Bmh1p (30.1 kDa) and Bmh2p (31.1 kDa) are 91 and 97% identical, respectively, to it, with the highest homology residing in the conserved domains of these proteins (26van Hemert M.J. van Heusden G.P.H. Steensma H.Y. Yeast. 2001; 18: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Single deletion of the BMH1 andBMH2 genes had a modest effect on the physiology of the cells, but the bmh1/bmh2 double knockout resulted in lethality for the budding yeast (6van Heusden G.P.H. Wenzel T.J. Lagendijk E.L. Steensma H.Y. van den Berg J.A. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This lethal disruption has been complemented by at least four different Arabidopsis isoforms (27van Heusden G.P.H. van der Zanden A.L. Ferl R.J. Steensma H.Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 252-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates the interaction of Bmh1p and Bmh2p with cruciform-containing DNA in vitro and their in vivo association with the S. cerevisiae autonomous replication sequence ARS307. A cruciform-specific association of these yeast homologues of 14-3-3 is also illustrated, akin to their human counterpart. Furthermore, the presence of cruciform structure at ARS307 is revealed by anti-cruciform antibody immunoprecipitation and conventional PCR. The yeast strains used in this study were generous gifts of Dr. G. P. H. van Heusden (Institute of Molecular Plant Sciences, Leiden University, Leiden, The Netherlands): GG582-5D (wild-type,haploid leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-92 his4), GG583-24A (haploid leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-92 his4 bmh1::LEU2), GG583-24D (haploid leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-92 bmh2::URA3), GG1259 (haploid leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-92 bmh1::LEU2 bmh2::URA3 his4 (pYES-TRP(GF14))). S. cerevisiae rich (yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD)) and complete minimal dropout mediums were prepared as previously described (28) and with a further addition of the specific nutrient requirement for each strain. All cells were grown at 30 °C. S. cerevisiae wild-type cells (strain GG582-5D) were cultured in YEPD medium at 30 °C until they reached exponential phase (A 595 ∼ 0.5). For synchronization to the G0 phase, the cells were transferred to (NH4)2SO4-free minimal medium for 48 h. For synchronization to G1/S, the cells were placed in YEPD medium containing 10 μm hydroxyurea (Sigma) for 36 h. Synchronization to G2/M was achieved by releasing the cells from the hydroxyurea block into YEPD medium containing 10 μg/ml nocodazole (Sigma) for 24 h. Cell synchronization was monitored by flow cytometry. Preparation of nuclei from S. cerevisiae was carried out by differential centrifugation as previously described (28). Cruciform-containing DNA (pRGM21×pRGM29) was constructed and end-labeled as described previously (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mixtures were subjected to 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 180 V for 2 h. The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. The same protocol was followed with increasing amounts (3, 6, and 12 μg) of wild-type,bmh1 −, or bmh2 − S. cerevisiae nuclear extracts. 0.1 μg of wild-type S. cerevisiae nuclear extract was incubated with 1 ng of labeled cruciform DNA (∼8 × 10−3 pmol) and increasing molar amounts (100-, 500-, 1000-, 1500-, and 2000-fold) of either unlabeled cruciform DNA or unlabeled linear DNA (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M.

The gel was dried and exposed for autoradiography. Bmh1p, Bmh2p, and GF14 were purified as previously described (15Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) with some modifications. In brief, 300 ng of labeled cruciform DNA (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was used for binding either Bmh1p or Bmh2p from 100 μg of wild-type S. cerevisiae nuclear extract or GF14 from the same amount ofbmh1 − bmh2 −double-knockout (grown in the presence of galactose) nuclear extract. Cruciform-Bmh1p/Bmh2p and cruciform-GF14 complexes were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 180 V for 1.5 h. Each complex was eluted from the gel by isotachophoresis as previously described (15Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The eluates were concentrated to ∼3 μg/μl using a Microcon YM-10 concentrator (Millipore Corp.). Then, 30 μg of each band shift-eluted preparation and the corresponding nuclear extracts (total of 30 μg) were mixed with 1× SDS sample buffer containing 100 mm dithiothreitol, and the samples were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 200 V for 40 min, and the gel contents were subsequently transferred to ImmobilonTM P transfer membrane at 100 V for 1 h at 4 °C. Membranes were probed with rabbit anti-Bmh1p/Bmh2p antibody (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) or with anti-GF14 monoclonal antibody (kindly supplied by Dr. R. J. Ferl) (29Lu G. Delisle A.J. de Vetten N.C. Ferl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11490-11494Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In vivocross-linking was carried out essentially as previously described (30Takahashi K. Saitoh S. Yanagida M. Sci. STKE. 2000; 56: 1-11Google Scholar). In brief, 100 ml of strain GG582-5D in YEPD medium containing 2% glucose was grown to A 595 = 0.8–1. 0.1 volume of 11% formaldehyde solution was added to the culture (final concentration of 1%) and incubated for 10 min at 26 °C with gentle shaking. The cell culture was then chilled in an ice-water bath for 50 min with occasional shaking. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. The pellet was washed three times with ice-cold buffer I (50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate). Pellets from either cross-linked or uncross-linked cells were resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold buffer I containing protease inhibitors (1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and one capsule of protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals)). The same volume (500 μl) of glass beads was added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was vigorously vortexed for 30 s and then chilled on ice for another 30 s for eight consecutive cycles until >80% of the cells were lysed. After spinning the samples, the supernatants were recovered and subjected to sonication to shear the chromatin DNA to sizes ranging between 0.5 and 1.0 kb. The suspensions were sonicated for 30 s four times on ice, leaving 1-min intervals on ice between each pulse to chill the samples. After centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were transferred to fresh Eppendorf tubes on ice. The protein concentration of each supernatant was adjusted to 20 μg/μl by dilution with ice-cold buffer I. An aliquot of this supernatant served as the whole cell extract (WCE). 200 μl of the WCE was incubated with 50 μl of protein G-agarose (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) on a rotating wheel for 1 h at 4 °C to reduce the background caused by nonspecific adsorption of irrelevant proteins/DNAs to protein G-agarose beads. The cleared chromatin lysates were then incubated at 4 °C for 12 h with 10 μl of either preimmune serum or rabbit anti-Bmh1p/Bmh2p polyclonal antibody (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). 50 μl of protein G-agarose was then added, and the incubation was continued for 2 h. The precipitates were successively washed twice for 5 min at 4 °C with 1 ml of each of the following buffers: ice-cold buffer I, ice-cold buffer II (50 mm Hepes/KOH (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 1% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate); ice-cold buffer III (10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.5), 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate); and ice-cold Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.6). Finally, the pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of extraction buffer (1% SDS/Tris/EDTA buffer). Half of the sample was then incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse the protein-DNA cross-links, followed by a 2-h incubation at 37 °C with 50 μg of proteinase K (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The other half (non-reversed cross-link) was only incubated with the proteinase K. At the end, samples were processed to purify the DNA by passing them through QIAquick PCR purification columns (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA). The immunoprecipitated material (WCE and genomic DNA) was used as template in conventional PCRs with Ready-To-Go PCR beads (AmershamBiosciences). Primers ARS307A (5′-ATATTGCAATTACTTCTTCTCATGCAC-3′) and ARS307B (5′-GGTAGGGATAATAATCTGTAATGAGGA-3′) (1 μm each; GENSET Corp.) were used to amplify a 370-bp DNA fragment from the yeast autonomous replication sequence ARS307 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF087952). An initial denaturation for 5 min at 94 °C was followed by 35 cycles of denaturing for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 30 s at 50 °C, polymerization for 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels, visualized with ethidium bromide, and photographed with an Eagle Eye apparatus (Speed Light/BT Sciencetech-LT1000). Immunoprecipitation of cruciform-containing DNA using 2D3, an anti-cruciform DNA monoclonal antibody (mAb) (31Frappier L. Price G.B. Martin R.G. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), was carried out essentially as previously described (32Bell D. Sabloff M. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Price G.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 299-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, 500 μl of hybridoma 2D3 or myeloma P3 cell culture supernatant containing 5–10 μg/ml immunoglobulin was diluted 1:1 with phosphate-buffered saline and adjusted to pH 7.4 with HCl. Antibody reaction with DNA was accomplished by addition to the antibody solution of 10 μg of high molecular mass yeast genomic DNA prepared using a QIAGEN genomic DNA kit in a polypropylene microtube. After a 1-h incubation on ice, 600 units of high concentration restriction endonucleaseEcoRI (New England Biolabs Inc.) was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C overnight (12–16 h). Another 600 units of EcoRI was added after the overnight incubation, and the reaction mixture was incubated a further 90 min at 37 °C. Antibody-bound DNA was extracted from unbound DNA using rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin conjugated to polyacrylamide beads (Bio-Rad). The Immunobeads were prepared by washing them once with 0.15m NaCl and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and once with Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) and then resuspending them in Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) at 12 mg/ml. 3 mg of Immunobeads was incubated with the antibody-bound, EcoRI-digested DNA on ice for 1 h and mixed occasionally. The DNA-antibody-Immunobeads complex was washed free of unbound DNA three times with 1 ml of buffer containing 0.5m NaCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mmTris (pH 7.4) by centrifuging the bead complex at 12,000 ×g for 20 s, decanting the supernatant, and gently resuspending the pellet in the wash solution. Washing was then repeated three times with 1.0 ml of 0.15 m NaCl and 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Nonidet-40. The affinity-purified DNA was eluted from the bound immunoglobulin by resuspending the bead complex in 50 μl of Tris/EDTA buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% SDS; the Immunobeads were removed by centrifuging the mixture at 12,000 × g for 2 min. The DNA was further purified using the QIAquick PCR purification columns. The immunoprecipitated material was used as template for amplification with either primers ARS307A and ARS307B for the ARS307 region (described above) or primers YCL010C(A) (5′-TACCTGCCTATAACCCTACAACATCAC-3′) and YCL010C(B) (5′-TACACCTTGCCTGAGTTGCCCAATTCA-3′) for the YCL010C region (GenBankTM/EBI accession number NC_001135). As shown in Fig.1 A (compare lanes 1and 3), nuclear proteins from S. cerevisiaewild-type cells (strain GG582-5D) were able to retard the migration of a cruciform-containing DNA molecule (see “Experimental Procedures”). As a positive control, human CBP/14-3-3 was used (Fig.1 A, lane 2), which produced the expected band-shift pattern (15Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from thebmh1 − (strain GG583-24A) orbmh2 − (strain GG583-24D) single-knockout cells failed to produce large amounts of band shifts (Fig. 1 A,lanes 4 and 5), although ∼18 and 7% retardation was observed when extracts from the GG583-24A and GG583-24D strains were used, respectively (lane 4). However, the latter band shift was not always reproducible. Band-shift assays were also carried out using nuclear extracts from the bmh1/bmh2double-knockout cells (strain GG1259) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 6–9). Viability of this S. cerevisiae strain, containing a genetic deletion of the Bmh1p and Bmh2p proteins (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), was supported by the 14-3-3 Arabidopsis homologue GF14 (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The cDNA encoding the GF14 protein is under the control of theGAL1 promoter (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Induction of GF14 expression occurs in the presence of galactose, whereas repression occurs in medium containing glucose. Nuclear extracts from the GG1259 cells grown in 2% galactose showed a retardation in the migration of the cruciform DNA (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). However, replacement with medium containing 2% glucose showed that, after 24 h in this new condition, the band shift was reduced (Fig. 1 A, lane 7) and was completely lost after 48 h of repression of GF14 in the presence of glucose (lane 8). Although the S. cerevisiae double-knockout cells did not grow on medium with glucose (7van Heusden G.P.H. Griffiths D.J. Ford J.C. Chin-A-Woeng T.F. Schrader P.A. Carr A.M. Steensma H.Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), they remained viable for at least 48 h. Viability of 48-h cultures was confirmed by dilution transfer of the cells into new medium containing 2% galactose, which led to the recovery of the cruciform-binding activity (Fig. 1 A, lane 9). Furthermore, when these cells were plated on solid medium, their morphology was normal, excluding the possibility of mutant selection (data not shown). 14-3-3 proteins can associate with their partners either as monomers or as protein dimers. However, the cruciform-binding activity is found solely in 14-3-3 dimers (15Todd A. Cossons N. Aitken A. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14317-14325Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 1 A show that the Bmh1p-Bmh2p heterodimer (lane 3, nuclear extract from GG582-5D cells) is more efficient in binding to cruciform DNA than either of the homodimers, Bmh2p-Bmh2p (lane 4, nuclear extracts from GG583-24A cells) and Bmh1p-Bmh1p (lane 5, nuclear extract from GG583-24D cells). This conclusion was confirmed in a set of electrophoretic mobility shift assays in which increasing amounts (3, 6, and 12 μg) of nuclear extract from the three strains were used (Fig.1 B). A comparison of the band shift for each of the nuclear extract amounts indicated that Bmh2p-Bmh2p (strain GG583-24A) was able to retard the migration of the cruciform DNA (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3, 6, and 9), although, even at the highest concentration (lane 9), its band shift was less efficient and weaker than the one obtained with the wild-type nuclear extract (lanes 2, 5, and 8), even at the lowest amount used (lane 2). No band shift was detectable when nuclear extracts from strain GG583-24D (bmh2 −) were used (Fig. 1 B,lanes 4, 7, and 10), even at the highest concentration (lane 10), indicating that the Bmh1p-Bmh1p homodimer is not able to bind to the cruciform DNA. Human CBP/14-3-3 has been shown to recognize and to bind to cruciform DNA specifically by structure rather than sequence (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To analyze whether the binding of the 14-3-3S. cerevisiae homologues Bmh1p and Bmh2p to cruciform DNA is sequence- or structure-specific, competition binding assays were carried out as previously described for human CBP/14-3-3 (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the cruciform complex-specific band decreased at a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled cruciform competitor and was completely abolished at a 500-fold molar excess of unlabeled cruciform competitor, as has also been observed for human CBP/14-3-3 (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Use of a <100-fold molar excess of unlabeled cruciform did not result in competition (data not shown), as also previously observed with human CBP/14-3-3 (18Pearson C.E. Ruiz M.T. Price G.B. Zannis-Hadjopoulos M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 14185-14196Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, the same complex was unaffected by as much as a 2000-fold molar excess of unlabeled linear competitor (Fig. 2 B). The protein composition of the"

Z., Ishisaki, A., Kohno, K., and Funa, K. (2001) J. Cell Sci. 114, 1533–1544). We demonstrate here that the p53 family protein p73α represses PDGF β-receptor transcription essentially by the same mechanism. p73α but not p73β or p53 represses the transcription in concordance with its ability to bind NF-YC and NF-YB. None of other p73 isoforms (i.e. p73β, p73γ, p73ε), C-terminal deletion mutants of p73α, and p53 is able to bind NF-Y with the exception of p63α. This finding suggests that the sterile α-motif domain present only in p73α and p63α is the interaction site. For the repression, the N-terminal transactivation domain of p73α is also indispensable, arguing for the importance of the activity of p73α in the mechanism. p73α binds the C-terminal HAP domain of NF-YC previously found to be the interaction site with c-Myc and TBP. Because c-Myc induces and activates p73α (Zaika, A., Irwin, M., Sansome, C., and Moll, U. M. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11310–11316) and they bind each other (Uramoto, H., Izumi, H., Ise, T., Tada, M., Uchiumi, T., Kuwano, M., Yasumoto, K., Funa, K., and Kohno, K. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, in press), we examined whether the repression by p73 is dependent on c-Myc. However, Myc-null rat fibroblasts are also susceptible to p73α-induced repression. Serum stimulation of NIH3T3 cells gradually decreased the amount of endogenous NF-Y binding to the PDGF β-receptor promoter, whereas NF-YA expression in the nuclear extracts remains unchanged. Our results indicate that serum stimulation induces c-Myc and p73α, leading to the down-regulation of PDGF β-receptor expression by repressing its transcription. We recently reported that c-Myc represses the transcription of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β-receptor (Izumi, H., Molander, C., Penn, L. Z., Ishisaki, A., Kohno, K., and Funa, K. (2001) J.

The receptors are endowed with a split tyrosine kinase in the intracellular domains, which upon ligand binding, dimerize and become autophosphorylated to activate the downstream signal cascades. Thus, it is essential for cells that the receptors are activated at right time by refined control mechanisms. The mechanism of activation has been extensively studied, whereas knowledge regarding the control mechanism to cease activation is still limited. Both of these mechanisms can be disturbed to maintain the active status in cancer cells. In normal cells, the PDGF β-receptor expression decreases rapidly after stimulation by PDGF, which is an important feedback mechanism to prevent further activation of the cells leading to uncontrolled proliferation. The attenuation on the PDGF signaling occurs at multiple levels with both short and long term effects. The receptors on the cell surface decrease by ligand-induced receptor-mediated endocytosis (8Mori S. Ronnstrand L. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4917-4921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (9Miyake S. Mullane-Robinson K.P. Lill N.L. Douillard P. Band H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16619-16628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). As soon as the ligands diminish or cells become confluent or differentiated, tyrosine phosphatases can be activated, reverting the receptor to its normal status (10Shimizu A. Persson C. Heldin C.H.

As a long term effect, the transcription of the receptor itself can be repressed by increased c-Myc following stimulation by PDGF or serum (1Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K.

A Myc-null cell line showed a high and stable level of PDGF β-receptor mRNA, which disappeared upon forced expression of c-Myc (12Oster S.K. Marhin W.W. Asker C. Facchini L.M. Dion P.A. Funa K. Post M. Sedivy J.M. Penn L.Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6768-6778Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that c-Myc represses the transcription of the receptor through binding to the NF-Y transcription factor and interferes its activation (1Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K. Funa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse PDGF β-receptor promoter contains a CCAAT box, and the NF-Y transcription factor binds to the motif and activates the transcription (13Ballagi A.E. Ishizaki A. Nehlin J.O. Funa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 14Ishisaki A. Murayama T. Ballagi A.E. Funa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). NF-Y consists of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC subunits that are all necessary for DNA binding (15Kim I.S. Sinha S. de Crombrugghe B. Maity S.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4003-4013Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The specific domains of NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC that are needed for subunit interaction and DNA binding have conserved homologous sequences with the yeast HAP2, HAP3, and HAP5 proteins, respectively (as reviewed in Ref. 16Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). The repression of c-Myc on PDGF β-receptor promoter activity is dependent on the interaction of c-Myc with HAP domains of NF-YB and NF-YC (1Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K. Funa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently found that c-Myc binds p73α, thereby either activating or repressing the target genes of Myc or p73α, respectively (3Uramoto H. Izumi H. Ise T. Tada M. Uchiumi T. Kuwano M. Yasumoto K. Funa K. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277 (in press)Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been reported that c-Myc induces and activates p73α and p73β (2Zaika A. Irwin M. Sansome C. Moll U.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11310-11316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to examine the effect of p73 on PDGF β-receptor transcription. p73 is one of the recently identified p53-related family proteins including p63 and p51 (as reviewed in Ref. 17Irwin M. Kaelin W. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). p73 is similar to p53 in its ability to form oligomers, bind DNA, and activate transcription of p53-responsive genes by genotoxic stresses, leading to various actions such as induction of growth suppression and apoptosis. However, p73 seems to play more essential roles in development and differentiation (18Bamberger C. Schmale H. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). There are several splicing variants of p73 (α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ) and also variants without N-terminal transactivation domains that act as dominant negative proteins for the corresponding full-length proteins (17Irwin M. Kaelin W. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar). Roles of these proteins in normal cells have not yet been fully elucidated. The expression levels of p73 proteins are low in normal cells, and often, only p73α and p73β can be detected. We propose that serum stimulation induces c-Myc and p73α, leading to the down-regulation of PDGF β-receptor expression by repressing its transcription in a similar manner. NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, HO15.19 (myc−/−), rat fibroblasts (19Mateyak M.K. Obaya A.J. Adachi S. Sedivy J.M.

All expression of cDNA in cells was carried out by transient transfection with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. N-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tagged pcDNA3-HA-p73α, pcDNA3-HA-p73β, pcDNA3-HA-p63α, and N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) deletion mutant of p73α were provided by Dr. Melino (University of Rome, Rome, Italy) (20Levrero M., De Laurenzi A.V.

The following day, cells were transiently transfected with an expression plasmid, a reporter plasmid, and 0.3 μg of CH110 (β-galactosidase expression plasmid, Promega). Total amount of DNA per well was adjusted to 1 μg by the addition of mock DNA plasmid. When two expression plasmids were used (i.e. experiments with p73 and c-myc), 0.25 μg of CH110 was used. After 48 h, cells were lysed with 100 μl/well reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activity was measured according to vendor's instruction (Promega) by using Victor 1420 Multilabel Counter (Wallac). Luciferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase activity. Measured values are expressed as the means ± S.D. ANOVA was employed to test significant changes in activities. pvalues < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 12-well plates at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with 0.3 μg of HAp73 expression plasmid and 0.2 μg of pSG424 vector containing the GAL4-DNA binding domain fused with NF-YC full-length or Δ1-107 containing the C-terminal HAP5 domain and the TAD or Δ1-247 containing only the C-terminal part of the TAD together with 0.2 μg of Gal4-TATA luciferase reporter vector (24Persson U.

The total amount of DNA per well was adjusted to 1 μg/well. The luciferase activity was measured and standardized to β-galactosidase as described above. NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes at a density of 1.1 × 105cells/dish. After 24 h, half of the cells of each cell type were transfected with 2 μg of HAp73 expression plasmid/dish, and the remaining cells were transfected with 2 μg of HApcDNA3 vector alone. The cells were kept in 10% FCS, and RNA was extracted essentially as described (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63191) Google Scholar) at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36 h after transfection. 3 μg of total RNA from each time point was transcribed into cDNA with random primers and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was carried out by using Taq polymerase (Fermentas) and Programmable Thermal Blok® (LabLine) as follows. For PDGFRβ, an aliquot (one-tenth) of the cDNA and the primers described previously (26Smits A. Ballagi A.E. Funa K. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 986-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) were used. An initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 7 min was followed by 32 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 45 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 30 s. For p73α, 2.5% cDNA was mixed with primers: 5′-CAGCAGCAGCTCCTACAGAGG-3′ and 5′-TACTGCTCGGGGATCTTCAGG-3′. Initial denaturation at 94° for 3 min was followed by 22 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, annealing at 67 °C for 45 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min. For β-actin, 5% cDNA and the primers described previously (27Ballagi-Pordany A. Funa K. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were used. Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min was followed by 25 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 63 °C for 45 s, and primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min, 30 s. All of the reactions were completed with a final extension step at 72 °C for 6 min. PCR products were analyzed on 1.5% TAE-agarose gel electrophoresis. The gels were stained with Sybr Gold (Molecular Probes) and scanned in a FLA2000 (Fuji). To see the time course of PDGF β-receptor expression following transfection of HAp73, NIH3T3 (5 × 104 cells/dish) cells and HO15.19 (c-Myc−/−) cells (1 × 105 cells/dish) were seeded in eight 6-cm dishes each. They were transfected as described above for reverse transcription-PCR. The cells were harvested at 0, 12, 24, and 36 h post-transfection. They were scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and centrifuged for 2 min at 4 °C at 1000 × g. The cells were resuspended in 100 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mmEDTA, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 20 min, and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The amount of protein was determined with Bio-Rad protein assay, and 50 μg of each sample was adjusted to equal volumes (75 μl/sample), boiled, and separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. The gel was transferred onto a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Biosciences), which was cut and blotted with 0.13 μg/ml PDGF β-receptor antibody (958) or 0.5 μg/ml HA (3F10) antibody in 1% skim milk. The membrane was developed by the ECL using vendor's protocol (Amersham Biosciences) and exposed in LAS-1000 Plus (Fuji). To estimate the p73 concentration-dependent PDGF β-receptor expression, NIH3T3 and HO15.19 fibroblasts were transfected with 0, 0.1, 0.5, or 2 μg of HAp73 expression plasmid as described for the time course experiment. The total amount of transfected DNA was adjusted to 2 μg with HA pcDNA3 vector. After another 24 h, cells were harvested, separated, and blotted in the same way as described for the time course experiment. COS-1 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h, cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of HAp73 expression plasmid with 1 μg of FLAG-NF-YA, FLAG-NF-YB, or FLAG-NF-YC expression plasmid. After another 24 h, cells were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer described above. The cells were allowed to lyse for 20 min on ice and then were scraped. Each lysate was transferred into a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 40 μl of the supernatant was transferred to a new tube for expression control of the transfected plasmids. The remaining 160 μl of the lysate was transferred to another tube and rotated at 4 °C with 15 μl of FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel for 2 h. The agarose beads were washed with 4 × 1 ml of lysis buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE (10%), and blotted onto Hybond-P membrane. The membranes were first blotted with anti-HA (3F10) antibody and developed by ECL, and the signal was detected in LAS-1000 Plus. After drying, the membranes were reblotted with FLAG M2-agarose antibody. A single-stranded antisense oligonucleotide containing CCAAT was used as a probe. The probe was complemented with a sense strand and labeled with [32P]ATP. The template sequence was 5′-TTTGGGGGAAAGGCTGCAGGGCCGTTCTGATTGGCCAAGC-3′. The labeled DNA fragments were separated from unincorporated [32P]ATP using a G-25 MicroSpinTM column (Amersham Biosciences). To obtain nuclear extracts, a total of 4 × 105 NIH3T3 cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes. Nuclear protein was extracted from the cells at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 h after 10% serum stimulation following 48 h of culture in serum-free medium, nuclear extracts and 4 μg of protein were preincubated in 20 μl of reaction mixture containing 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.6 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 μg/μl BSA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mg/ml poly(dI·dC). Unlabeled competitors (100× labeled oligo), 32P-labeled oligonucleotide, and antibodies NF-YA or p73 (0.5 μg/reaction) were added in this order. The reactions were incubated 10 min at room temperature. At the end of the incubation, 4 μl of 6× agarose dye loading-buffer was added. The reaction mixtures were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide gel (polyacrylamide:bisacrylamide, 37.5:1) by 20 V/cm for 2 h at 4 °C. The gel was dried and exposed to a BAS imaging plate (Fuji) and scanned in a FLA-2000. We used the PDGF β-receptor promoter luciferase reporter, pGLSacI/SacI (pGL3−1900; −1900 to +23) containing CCAAT motif located ∼60 bp upstream of the first initiation site (Fig.1 A) (13Ballagi A.E. Ishizaki A. Nehlin J.O. Funa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, cotransfection of p73α decreased the luciferase activity of pGL3-1900 to 35% of that obtained with a control vector containing only HA tag. In comparison, the expression of neither p73β nor p53 did significantly and stably affect the reporter activity. The shorter MluI/SacI (pGL3-116; −116 to +23) promoter luciferase activity was also repressed by p73α to the same extent (result not shown). This shorter promoter contains Sp1 and NF-Y binding sites (28Molander C. Hackzell A. Ohta M. Izumi H. Funa K. Mol. Biol. Rep. 2002; 28: 223-233Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that c-Myc represses PDGF β-receptor promoter (1Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K. Funa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether c-Myc is involved in the p73 repression on the promoter-luciferase activity, we used the HO15.19, c-myc−/− rat fibroblast cell line and the NIH3T3 normal mouse fibroblast cell line. In both cell lines, p73α and c-Myc significantly decreased the promoter activity (Fig. 1 B). p73α repressed the promoter-luciferase activity more effectively than c-Myc in NIH3T3 cells containing c-myc. In the HO15.19, however, the activity of p73α was similar to that of c-Myc, and both together resulted in a further decrease in the transcriptional activity. The 1.9-kb PDGF β-receptor promoter lacks a putative binding site for p73. To see whether the CCAAT-binding NF-Y transcription factor is required for the p73α-mediated repression, we co-transfected the DNA-binding defective and dominant negative NF-YA (DNNF-YA) with p73 and the promoter-luciferase plasmids. The DNNF-YA is shown to act as a dominant repressor of NF-Y·DNAcomplex formation and of NF-dependent transcription (23Mantovani R., Li, X.Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huisjduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the co-expression of DNNF-YA and the promoter-luciferase plasmids decreased half of the promoter activity. However, additional co-expression of p73α to DNNF-YA showed no further effect on the promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). In fact, the overexpression of p73α yielded a comparable repression as was seen by DNNF-YA alone on the promoter. These results indicate that p73α represses the promoter activity by its effect on NF-Y, attenuating the stimulatory effect of NF-Y on the promoter (14Ishisaki A. Murayama T. Ballagi A.E. Funa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The HA-tagged p73 expression plasmid, HAp73α, HAp73β, HAp53, or HAp63α, respectively, was co-transfected with the FLAG-NF-YA, FLAG-NF-YB, FLAG-NF-YC, or control FLAG-vector expression plasmid, respectively, to COS-1 cells. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody and immunoblotted with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig.2 A, p73α and p63α bound FLAG-NF-YB and FLAG-NF-YC in vivo but not FLAG-NF-YA or the control vector. Neither p73β nor p53 bound any of the NF-Y subunits. Immunoblotting of the membrane being transferred with the same cell lysates, which reacted with the anti-HA antibody, as well as the anti-FLAG M2 antibody confirmed the appropriate expression of proteins. The N-terminal region of p73α and p73β is homologous, and the only notable divergence can be found in the C-terminal area (Fig. 2 B). This unique area of p73α not found in p73β is probably responsible for the binding. In addition, p63α also bound NF-Y. Because in vertebrae, this p53 family protein is the only one other than p73α that contains an area known as the SAM domain in its C terminus. As expected, N-terminal deletion mutant of p73α lacking the TAD (ΔNp73α) also bound NF-Y (result not shown). To determine whether this area is responsible for the interaction, we examined several other p73 isoforms (β, γ, and ε) as well as the two C-terminal deletion mutants of p73α, the Δp73αC269 and Δp73αC424, together with p73α and p53 as a positive and negative control, respectively (Fig. 2 C). In this experiment, we used FLAG-tagged p73 and HA-tagged NF-YC to confirm the reciprocal binding. No other p73 isoforms could bind NF-YC, and the C-terminal deletion mutants of p73α without SAM domain were unable to bind NF-YC. The binding site of NF-YC was also determined by co-immunoprecipitation using various N-terminal deletion mutants (Fig. 2, D andE). This result indicates that the C-terminal HAP5 domain of NF-YC, i.e. amino acids 108–115, is necessary for the binding. To exclude the possibility that p73α and NF-Y interacts via c-Myc, the binding assay between NF-YB or YC and p73α was repeated in HO15.19 c-myc−/−cells (Fig. 2 F). Again, also in this cell line, p73α binds the NF-Y subunits B and C, indicating that c-mycis dispensable for this binding. The transactivation domain of NF-YC subunit has the highest activity of all three NF-Y subunits, whereas NF-YB contains very little such activity (29Serra E. Zemzoumi K. di Silvio A. Mantovani R. Lardans V. Dissous C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Therefore, p73α effect was examined on its activity of the C-terminal transactivation domain of NF-YC (Fig. 2 G). The deletion mutant containing the transactivation domain was coupled downstream of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of GAL4 transcription factor (Fig. 2 H) (1Izumi H. Molander C. Penn L.Z. Ishisaki A. Kohno K. Funa K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1533-1544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As reported, the full-length NF-YC fused to DBD of GAL4 transcription factor did not significantly activate transcription from the GAL4-TATA-promoter, whereas the corresponding constructs containing only the TAD are active (29Serra E. Zemzoumi K. di Silvio A. Mantovani R. Lardans V. Dissous C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3800-3805Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). When the N-terminal deletion mutant of NF-YC retaining the C-terminal HAP domain needed for the p73 binding (GAL4-DBD-NF-YCΔ1−107) was co-transfected with p73α, the transactivation activity was diminished to half of that obtained by co-transfection of the control HA-vector, indicating that p73 interferes with the activation of NF-YC (Fig. 2 G). In agreement, the activity of the GAL4-DBD-NF-YCΔ1−248 being unable to bind p73α was not affected by co-transfection of p73α. We determined the binding site of p73α to its C-terminal SAM domain. To see whether the TAD of p73α is necessary for the repression, we transfected the ΔNp73α lacking the TAD (ΔNp73α), HA-vector alone, or the full-length p73α together with the PDGF β-receptor promoter luciferase construct in NIH3T3 cells and measured its activity. As shown in the Fig.3 A, there was no repression, but rather activation was observed when TAD was deleted from p73α. This finding was further confirmed by the concentration-dependent increase of promoter activity by the addition of ΔNp73α to the full-length p73α. ΔNp73α alone stimulated the promoter activity. We demonstrated that p73α repressed the transcriptional activity of PDGF β-receptor promoter. We next examined whether this repression is reflected in the mRNA and protein expression of PDGF β-receptor by reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting. When HA-tagged p73α was transfected in NIH3T3 cells, the expression of p73α mRNA increased as judged by the p73α PCR product. It became detectable at 4 h to increase gradually up to 24 h, remaining at the same level at 36 h. On the contrary, the PDGF β-receptor PCR product being clearly expressed already at 0 and 4 h gradually decreased at 8, 12, and 36 h. (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, the transfection of the control HA-vector without p73α did not affect the level of PDGF receptor mRNA. In agreement with this finding, p73α protein was detected already at 12 h, and the expression increased up to 36 h (Fig. 4 A). By contrast, the receptor expression rapidly decreased already at 12 h and remained as a faint band during the whole observation period. Control HA-vector transfection did not alter the receptor expression level that remained at a high level. The"

The presence of trifluoroethanol resulted in a reduction in the [θ]222/[θ]208 circular dichroism ratio in all of the fragments and induced stable trimer formation only in those containing residues 261–284. Urea denaturation monitored by circular dichroism and fluorescence revealed that residues 261–284 of tropomyosin are very important for the stability of the C-terminal half of the molecule as a whole. Furthermore, the absence of this region greatly increases the cooperativity of urea-induced unfolding. Temperature and urea denaturation experiments show that Tm143–235 is less stable than other fragments of the same size. We have identified a number of factors that may contribute to this particular instability, including an interhelix repulsion between g and e′ positions of the heptad repeat, a charged residue at the hydrophobic coiled-coil interface, and a greater fraction of β-branched residues located at d positions.

Synthetic peptide models for coiled-coils may not always be taken as representative because they often employ regular patterns of residues at positions a andd and lack i, i+3 and i, i+4 intrahelical ionic interactions (7Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 237: 500-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Zhou N.E. Kay C.M. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 5739-5746Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Natural coiled-coil sequences, such as tropomyosin (Tm),1 are more complex, with irregular patterns of intrahelix and interhelix side chain-side chain interactions and a greater variety of residues at the hydrophobic core. Tm can be used as a natural model for the study of the principal interactions that maintain the coiled-coil structure and α-helix stability. Muscle α-Tm is a symmetric coiled-coil composed of two parallel and in register ∼410 Å, 284-residue α-helices (2McLachlan A.D. Stewart M. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 98: 293-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar, 13Phillips Jr., G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol.

The C-terminal half of the Tm molecule is less thermally stable than the N-terminal half (15Pato M.D. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 593-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A series of studies (17Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7444-7445Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 18Holtzer M.E. Crimmins D.L. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1995; 35: 125-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have suggested that Tm fragments with less than 94 residues were unable to form stable secondary structures at low micromolar concentrations. Recently, Holtzer et al. (19Holtzer M.E. Mints L. Hogue A.R. d'Avignon D.A. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 2001; 59: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) showed that a 65-amino acid fragment (residues 190–254) presents a significant amount of α-helix (∼43%) when present in high micromolar concentrations (115 μm) at 10 °C but is essentially unfolded at 25 °C. Microcalorimetric analysis of α-Tm thermal denaturation has been interpreted as a multistep process in which specific Tm segments (“cooperative blocks”) denature independently of one another (20Potekhin S.A. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 519-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, the sum of the denaturation curves for two Tm subfragments corresponding to predicted cooperative blocks (190–254 and 253–280) is not equal to the experimental curve for the fragment 190–284, arguing for long range cooperativity along the Tm structure (19Holtzer M.E. Mints L. Hogue A.R. d'Avignon D.A. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 2001; 59: 257-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of the Tm folding process show that the rate-limiting step is not dimerization, but rather a slow first order isomerization of the preformed and correctly aligned dimer (21Mo J.M. Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 916-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Recently, Kammereret al. (22Kammerer R.A. Schulthess T. Landwehr R. Lustig A. Engel J. Aebi U. Steinmetz M.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13419-13424Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) proposed the importance of a minimal consensus “trigger” sequence responsible for the formation of autonomous folding units and partially folded coiled-coil dimers. However, Leeet al. (23Lee D.L. Lavigne P. Hodges R.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 539-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) have suggested that a complex combination of stabilizing effects along the sequence is a more general indicator of protein folding in coiled-coils than the identification of a specific sequence. In the case of Tm, the fact that fragments derived from different parts of the molecule form stable coiled-coils argues against the importance of a specific trigger sequence in Tm folding. Whether or not Tm folds via independent cooperative blocks or is nucleated by one or more specific sequences, it seems clear that Tm contains regions that are more intrinsically stable than others (15Pato M.D. Mak A.S. Smillie L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 593-601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 7444-7445Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 20Potekhin S.A. Privalov P.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 159: 519-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 24Lehrer S.S. J. Mol.

During thermal denaturation, the Tm region near residue Cys190 unfolds before strand separation (24Lehrer S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 209-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and high pressure produces partially unfolded Tm intermediates in which the polypeptide chains remain associated (26Suarez M.C. Lehrer S.S. Silva J.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1300-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the chemical environment of a pyrene probe bound to Cys190 is sensitive to the presence or absence of the last C-terminal residues of the Tm chain (27Clark I.D. Burtnick L.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10842-10846Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Therefore, long range communication between regions of variable stability may contribute to the folding and dimerization processes. In this work we have focused on the conformational stability of fragments derived from the C-terminal half of Tm and attempted to determine the contributions of these different regions to the stability of Tm as a whole. We present evidence that residues 261–284 confer a particular stability to the C-terminal region of Tm. Furthermore, the presence or absence of this region affects the cooperativity of the urea-induced denaturation process. In contrast, the region between residues 143 and 235 is relatively unstable, and we have identified a number of factors, which together may explain this observation. Our results may contribute to the understanding of the folding process in naturally occurring coiled-coils with relatively complex primary structures and may be relevant to the physiological function of Tm in the regulation of muscle contraction. Oligonucleotides were designed based on the cDNA sequence of chicken skeletal α-tropomyosin (28Gooding C. Reinach F.C. Macleod A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8105Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), cloned into the pET-3a expression vector (29Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A leucine codon at position 278 was substituted for a tryptophan codon by PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis as described (31Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) producing the plasmid pET-MASTmy278W. Plasmids pET-MASTmy (30Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or pET-MASTmy278W were used as templates for the subsequent PCRs involving specific pairs of the following set of seven oligonucleotides: NdeM142 (5′-GAA GAG AAG CAT ATG ATC CAA GAG ATC-3′), NdeM188 (5′-GAA CTA TCA CAT ATG AAA TGT GCT GAG-3′), NdeM219 (5′-TCG CAG AAA CAT ATG AAA TAT GAA GAG-3′), NdeM166 (5′-AAG TAT GAG CT ATG CGT AAG CTC GTG-3′), *236Hind (5′-AGC AAA TTC AGC AAG CTT TTA AGC CTC CTT CAG-3′), *261Hind (5′-CTT CAG TTT AAG CTT TTA AG CTC ATC TTC), and EcoRI(−) (5′-CAT TAA CCT ATA AAA ATA GGC G-3′). The oligonucleotide pairs used to produce sequences coding for each Tm fragment were NdeM142 and EcoRI(−) for Tm143–284(5OHW), NdeM188 andEcoRI(−) for Tm189–284(5OHW), or Tm189–284, NdeM219 and EcoRI(−) for Tm220–284(5OHW) or Tm220–284,NdeM142 and *236Hind for Tm143–235,NdeM166 and *261Hind for Tm167–260, and finally NdeM142 and *261Hind for Tm143–260. PCR products were digested withHindIII and NdeI and subsequently subcloned into expression vector pET-3a previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. Expression and purification of the Tm fragments containing 5-hydroxytryptophan at position 278 (Tm143–284(5OHW), Tm189–284(5OHW), and Tm220–284(5OHW)) were as described by Farah and Reinach (31Farah C.S. Reinach F.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10543-10551Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Tm189–284, Tm220–284, Tm143–235, Tm167–260, and Tm143–260 were expressed and purified as described for ASTm in Monteiro et al. (30Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry method (32Hartree E.F. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 48: 422-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were recorded on a Jasco 720 spectropolarimeter. Buffer conditions and protein concentrations are indicated in the figure legends, and cell temperature was maintained with a circulating water bath. Far UV CD (190–260 nm) spectra were collected at 0.5-nm intervals, using a response time of 0.25 s and a velocity of 100 nm/min. At least four scans were collected for the urea and thermal denaturation curves (at 10 °C), and at least eight scans were collected for the experiments at 25 °C. The α-helix content was calculated based on the algorithm developed for coiled-coil proteins by Holtzer et al. (33Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Scolnick J Macromolecules. 1983; 16: 173-180Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Φh=((θ)−(θc)+(2.55I(θh∞)/n))/((θh∞)−(θc))Equation 1 where, Φh = fraction of residues in an α-helical conformation, θh∞ = mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm for a helix of infinite length (−386 degrees·cm2·mmol of peptide bonds−1), θc = mean residual ellipticity for a random coil at 222 nm (−10 degrees·cm2·mmol of peptide bonds−1),I = the average number of helical segments per chain (in this case equal to 1), n = the number of peptide bonds, and θ = mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm. Urea denaturation studies were carried out in 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA. A fresh stock solution of ∼9 murea (Sigma ultra pure grade) was prepared in the above buffer and mixed with the proteins to achieve the desired final concentration of urea and protein (10 μm dimer). Urea concentration was confirmed by refractive index (34Pace, C. N., and Scholtz, J. M. (1987) Protein Structure: A Practical Approach (Creighton, T. E., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 299–320.Google Scholar). Samples were incubated at 10 °C for 3 h to reach equilibrium before recording the CD spectra. The urea denaturation curve was analyzed as described by Pace and Scholtz (34Pace, C. N., and Scholtz, J. M. (1987) Protein Structure: A Practical Approach (Creighton, T. E., ed) 2nd Ed., pp. 299–320.Google Scholar), using Equation 2. ΔG=−RTlnK=−RTln((Yf−Y)/(Y−Yu)) =m×([urea]1/2−[urea])Equation 2 ΔG is the free energy of unfolding at each point of the denaturation curve, Y is the mean residual ellipticity at 222 nm, [urea]1/2 is the urea concentration at which 50% of the molecules are unfolded (assuming a two-state transition).Y f and Y u are the linear equations that define the pre-transition and post-transition base lines (urea sensitivities of the CD spectra of the folded and unfolded states, respectively). For all fragments, Y u was obtained directly from the denaturation curves. For Tm143–284(5OHW) and Tm189–284(5OHW), equations for Y f were also estimated directly from the denaturation curve. For some relatively unstable fragments,Y f could not be estimated accurately from the denaturation data and was therefore assigned values based on the similarity of the shape of the denaturation curve to that of other fragments. In this manner, Y f for Tm143–260 was assumed to be equal to that of Tm143–284(5OHW). For Tm220–284(5OHW), Tm143–235, and Tm167–260 we used the Y f equation for Tm189–284(5OHW). Curve fitting simulations showed that the calculated values of m and [urea]1/2 were relatively insensitive to the specific equation forY f employed. Thermal denaturation experiments were performed incubating a 10 μm (dimer) protein solution in the above buffer for 5 min at each temperature before recording the CD spectra as described above. Fluorescence experiments were performed on an AVIV Automated Titrating Differential/Ratio spectrofluorometer at 10 °C. The emission fluorescence spectra were collected at 337 nm (5-mm bandwidth) using an excitation wavelength of 305 nm (1-mm bandwidth). Buffer conditions were the same as for the urea denaturation experiments monitored by circular dichroism (above). Aliquots of a ∼9m urea solution were added automatically into the sample and reference cuvettes, and solutions were equilibrated for 5 min before each measurement. At the end of each titration, reversibility was confirmed by measuring the fluorescence of the sample after dilution with 20 volumes of buffer without urea. The data were analyzed in a manner similar to that described above for the CD experiments. Y u was obtained directly from the denaturation curves. Y f for Tm189–284(5OHW) and Tm220–284(5OHW)was set to be equal to Y f estimated from the denaturation curve of Tm143–284(5OHW). Protein solutions were dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out at 10 °C in a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using absorbance optics following the procedures described by Laue and Stafford (35Laue T.M. Stafford III, W.F. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28 (Oxford University Press, New York): 75-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). The fragments were analyzed at two different protein concentrations, in the absence or presence of 5 m urea and in the presence of 30% TFE. 110-μl aliquots of sample solution were loaded into six-sector charcoal-filled epon sample cells. Runs were performed at a minimum of two different speeds, and each speed was maintained until there was no significant difference in r 2/2versus absorbance scans taken 2 h apart to ensure that equilibrium was achieved. The sedimentation equilibrium data were evaluated using the NONLIN program, which incorporates a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting algorithm described by Johnson et al. (36Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Data were fit to either a single ideal species model or models containing two associating species. The protein partial specific volume and the solvent density were estimated using the SEDNTERP program, which incorporates calculations detailed by Laue et al. (37Laue T.M. Sarah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1991: 125Google Scholar). All proteins were equilibrated for 30 min under the conditions indicated in the figure legends. Gluteraldehyde was added to a final concentration of 0.02%, and after 15 min the cross-linking reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The products of the cross-linking reaction were analyzed in 15% SDS-PAGE. Ac-Tm215–235(Ac-SQKEDKYEEEIKVLTDKKLEA) was prepared manually by the stepwise solid phase method using Boc (tert-butyloxycarbonyl) chemistry as described previously (38Stewart J. Young J.D. Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis. 2nd Ed. Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL1984: 1-49Google Scholar, 39Varanda L.M. Miranda M.T. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Analysis and purification were performed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography using C18 columns. The chemical identity of the purified peptide was confirmed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The recombinant fragments, derived from the C-terminal half of skeletal muscle α-Tm, are shown schematically in Fig.1. They were designed so that all of the N-terminal residues fall in solvent-exposed positions of the heptad repeat (c, g, or f) to avoid electrostatic repulsion between the protonated α-amino groups, which may destabilize the coiled-coil structure (30Monteiro P.B. Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C termini all fell in an internal position of the heptad repeat, to mimic the C-terminal of native Tm, where Ile284 occupies ad position. The peptide Ac-Tm215–235 (Fig. 1) was synthesized with an acetylated N terminus and a free C terminus. Fragments Tm143–284(5OHW), Tm189–284(5OHW), and Tm220–284(5OHW) have a fluorescent probe (5-hydroxytryptophan) at position 278, occupied by a leucine in the native protein. The fluorescence intensity of this probe is sensitive to the conformational state of the polypeptide (see below) as well as troponin binding and head-to-tail interactions. 2A. A. Paulucci and C. S. Farah, manuscript in preparation. Two fragments, Tm189–284 and Tm220–284, with the native leucine residue at position 278, were also produced (not shown in the figure). We initially characterized the relative helix propensities of the Tm fragments (all 10 μm dimer) by analyzing their circular dichroism spectra in phosphate buffer (50 mm phosphate (pH 7.0), 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) at 25 °C under three conditions: in the presence and absence of 100 mm KCl and in the presence of 100 mm KCl and 50% TFE. The calculated helix content of all of the fragments increased in phosphate buffer upon the addition of 100 mmKCl (data not shown). The stability of Tm is known to increase as a function of ionic strength (40Mo J.M. Holtzer M.E. Holtzer A. Biopolymers. 1990; 30: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 41Lehrer S.S. Yuan A. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 176-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The CD spectra in the presence of 100 mm KCl with and without TFE are shown in Fig.2, and the α-helix contents of these fragments, based on their residual ellipticities at 222 nm, are presented in Table I.Table ICircular dichroism and urea denaturation parameters for recombinant Tm fragmentsTm fragment[θ]222[θ]222/[θ]208% α-helixUrea denaturation25 °C 100 mm KCl25 °C 100 mm KCl + 50% TFE25 °C 100 mm KCl25 °C 100 mmKCl + 50% TFE25 °C 100 mm KCl10 °C 100 mm KClm[urea]1/2degrees · cm2 dmol−1kcal mol−1 M−1(M)(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)Tm143–284 (5OHW)−31,013−23,5091.120.9180861.5 (1.9)2.29 (2.16)Tm189–284 (5OHW)−24,503−24,5931.100.9364752.0 (1.9)1.55 (1.37)Tm220–284 (5OHW)−15,927−20,8161.000.9442741.4 (1.9)1.17 (1.36)Tm189–284−25,951−23,1051.150.9967771.72.06Tm220–284−18,625−24,2581.130.9948681.31.57Tm143–235−8,113−16,3590.630.8720602.40.23Tm167–260−11,171−16,5270.860.8828641.30.68Tm143–260−26,703−29,7161.000.9069823.01.35 Open table in a new tab We found that in the absence of TFE, the α-helix contents of the fragments derived from the C-terminal half of Tm are not only dependent on their size, but also on the specific Tm region encompassed by the fragment. Tm220–284(5OHW) and Tm220–284, despite their relatively small size (65 residues), present CD spectra typical of an α-helix with minima at 208 and 222 nm (Table I and Fig.2). On the other hand Tm143–235, which has 93 amino acids, is only 20% α-helical at 25 °C (Table I) and has a CD spectrum that is more characteristic of a random-coil structure (Fig. 2). Another fragment, Tm167–260 (94 residues) also has a low α-helix content (28%) at 25 °C. All of the other recombinant Tm fragments present spectra typical of α-helical proteins in phosphate buffer plus 100 mm KCl. Therefore, for all fragments with 96 or fewer amino acids, the presence of residues 261–284 was essential to observe substantial helix content under these conditions. Lowering the temperature to 10 °C increases the helix content of all the fragments except Tm143–284(5OHW). At this temperature, all of the recombinant fragments have calculated helix contents of at least 60% (Table I). The presence of 50% TFE promotes an increase in the α-helix content of Tm220–284(5OHW), Tm220–284, Tm143–235, Tm167–260, and Tm143–260 (Fig. 2 and Table I). A comparison of the CD spectra in the presence and absence of TFE shows that all fragments experience an inversion in the relative magnitudes of their ellipticity minima at 208 and 222 nm (Fig. 2 and Table I). The θ222/θ208 ratio was found to be equal or greater than 1.0 in the absence of TFE for all fragments except for Tm143–235 and Tm167–260, which do not present much secondary structure under these conditions (Table I). In the presence of 50% TFE, θ222/θ208 is reduced to values below unity. The θ222/θ208 ratio has been proposed to be a function of the oligomerization state of a coiled-coil protein (see “Discussion”). We investigated the oligomerization state of the recombinant Tm polypeptides by AUC under a variety of conditions. Fig.3 shows the sedimentation equilibrium data collected for Tm220–284(5OHW)in phosphate buffer (+100 mm NaCl) with or without TFE or 5m urea. For this fragment, the data in each case could be fit to a single species model: dimers in phophate buffer, trimers in the presence of TFE, and monomers in the presence of urea. The apparent molecular masses obtained through sedimentation equilibrium experiments show that all fragments tested which possess the last 24 C-terminal residues (261–284) of tropomyosin are completely dimerized at 10 μm dimer in phosphate buffer plus 100 mm KCl, whereas the fragments that do not have this region are in a monomer-dimer equilibrium under these conditions (TableII). These latter fragments were found to be fully dimerized (or almost fully dimerized in the case of Tm143–260) at higher concentrations (between 100 and 140 μm) (Table II). In the presence of 5 m urea, all fragments tested dissociated to monomers (Table II), which appear to be completely unfolded (see Fig. 4). AUC experiments performed in the presence of 30% TFE at 10 μm dimer concentration showed that the fragments possessing residues 261–284 form stable trimers. Under these conditions, the fragments lacking this region present apparent molecular masses significantly less than that expected for a trimer (Table II). The data for Tm143–235 are best fit by a dimer model, whereas the data for Tm143–260 and Tm167–260 are best fit by assuming a mixture of monomers and either dimers or trimers. For these two fragments, the AUC data are fit equally well by monomer-dimer and monomer-trimer models, so trimer formation cannot be ruled out. The tendency to form trimers in the presence of T"
https://openalex.org/W2043337345,"The core protein of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major component of the viral nucleocapsid. The HCV core protein includes nuclear localization signal-like sequences and has various effects on cellular metabolism, playing roles, for example, in the regulation of transcription, apoptosis, and transformation. To examine the possibility of an effect of the core protein on nucleocytoplasmic transport, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The core protein (p23) is processed to p21 and is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in yeast cells, similar to that observed in mammalian cells in several cases. The nuclear import of the core protein requires the activity of small GTPase Ran/Gsp1p and is mediated by Kap123p in yeast cells. When the core protein was expressed in yeast cells, the import of the yeast AP1-like transcription factor Yap1p into the nucleus was inhibited. Experimentsin vitro involving Kap121p, also known as Pse1p, a receptor for the nuclear import of Yap1p, indicated that the amount of Yap1p bound to Kap121p was reduced in the presence of core protein. These results suggest that the HCV core protein affects cellular metabolism by disturbing transport of proteins to the nucleus.

To examine the possibility of an effect of the core protein on nucleocytoplasmic transport, we used the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The core protein (p23) is processed to p21 and is localized in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in yeast cells, similar to that observed in mammalian cells in several cases. The nuclear import of the core protein requires the activity of small GTPase Ran/Gsp1p and is mediated by Kap123p in yeast cells. When the core protein was expressed in yeast cells, the import of the yeast AP1-like transcription factor Yap1p into the nucleus was inhibited. Experimentsin vitro involving Kap121p, also known as Pse1p, a receptor for the nuclear import of Yap1p, indicated that the amount of Yap1p bound to Kap121p was reduced in the presence of core protein. These results suggest that the HCV core protein affects cellular metabolism by disturbing transport of proteins to the nucleus. hepatitis C virus nuclear localization signal nuclear pore complex GTP-loaded form of Ran GDP-loaded form of Ran glutathione S-transferase green fluorescent protein polyhistidine phosphate-buffered saline bovine serum albumin Hepatitis C virus (HCV),1 a major causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis (1Choo Q.L.

These properties of the core protein imply that it contributes to the pathogenesis of HCV by altering cellular metabolism. However, because of its complexity, the precise mechanisms responsible for the effects of the core protein (abbreviated as “core” hereafter) in the host cell remain to be elucidated.The amino-terminal half of core contains some nuclear localization signal-like (NLS-like) sequences and is strongly hydrophilic, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region is hydrophobic. The carboxyl-terminal region of core is processed to yield at least three products of different molecular masses (9Hüssy P. Langen H. Mous J. Jacobsen H. Virology. 1996; 224: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H.

Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Full-length core p23 (amino acid residues 1–191), as well as the truncated product p21, are localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus. The ratio of their distribution depends on the strain of HCV (24Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 26Liu Q.

Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A minor product, p19, is concentrated in the nucleus (24Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region of core is a determinant of the distribution of the protein between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. Recent studies indicate that core is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm in cultured cells (28Barba G Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Zs. Chapman M.J.

Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) and liver biopsy samples of HCV-infected patients (30Rullier A. Trimoulet P. Urbaniak R. Winnock M. Zauli D. Ballardini G. Rosenbaum J. Balaboud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Le Bail B. Mod. Pathol. 2002; 14: 496-505Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Regardless of whether the steady-state localization of core is in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, the structural characteristics of core indicate that elucidation of molecular mechanism for nucleocytoplasmic transport of core, and whether core can affect nucleocytoplasmic transport of cellular protein, might provide some insight into the effects of core on metabolism.In eukaryotic cells, many molecules are transported into or out of the nucleus through the nuclear pore complex (NPC), which is embedded in the nuclear envelope. Transport through the NPC is mediated by a family of soluble nuclear transport receptors (members of the importin β/karyopherin β family; Kaps), which have a binding domain for the GTP-loaded form of Ran (Ran-GTP) in the amino-terminal region, a carboxyl-terminal cargo-binding domain, and the ability to bind the components of the NPC. These receptors recognize their cargo by the presence of transport signals, such as the NLS or the nuclear export signal. Multiple nucleocytoplasmic transport pathways exist that exploit different transport receptors and transport signals (31Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar, 32Nakielny S. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1999; 99: 677-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 14 transport receptors (members of the importin β family) have been identified, on the basis of sequence homology, from the sequence of the entire genome (33Pemberton L.F. Blobel G. Rosenblum J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 34Wozniak R.W. Rout M.P. Aitchison J.D. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 184-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). These receptors include nine import receptors and five export receptors. Several mammalian orthologues of these receptors have been identified.The directionality of nucleocytoplasmic transport is thought to be related to the activity of the small GTPase Ran (35Izaurralde E. Kutay U. von Kobbe C. Mattaj I.W. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6535-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 36Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). It appears that Ran-GTP is localized in the nucleus, whereas the GDP-loaded form of Ran (Ran-GDP) is found in the cytoplasm. In the nucleus, the binding of Ran-GTP to an import receptor facilitates the dissociation of the import receptor-cargo complex and the release of the cargo (36Görlich D. Panté N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 37Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6237-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). By contrast, the binding of Ran-GTP to an export receptor is required for the formation of an export receptor-cargo-Ran-GTP complex in the nucleus (39Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar, 40Kutay U. Bischoff F.R. Kostka S. Kraft R. Görlich D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7430-7441Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ran-GDP, no export receptor-cargo complex is formed. Thus, the Ran-GTP gradient is a key determinant of the direction of transport between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments.In this study, we examined the possible effects of core on nucleocytoplasmic transport using S. cerevisiae as a model system. Numerous genetic and cell biological studies using these yeast cells have contributed extensively to our current understanding of the mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport, which appears to be shortly conserved in yeast and mammalian cells (42Corbett A.H. Silver P.A. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 193-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that the subcellular localization of core in yeast cells is similar to that in mammalian cells reported by a number of groups (24Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Liu Q. Tackney C. Bhat R.A. Prince A.M. Zhang P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 657-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We found that the nuclear import of core required Ran/Gsp1p and was mediated by the import receptor Kap123p in yeast cells. Moreover, core inhibited the Kap121p-dependent import of the yeast AP-1-like transcription factor Yap1p into yeast nuclei. Our experiments in vitro suggested that core reduced the amount of Yap1p that bound to Kap121p. These results imply that core affects metabolism by disturbing the nuclear transport of cellular proteins.DISCUSSIONBecause nucleocytoplasmic transport systems are strongly conserved in S. cerevisiae and mammals at the molecular level, we used yeast cells as a model of mammalian cells. We found that the processing and subcellular localization of core in yeast cells resemble those in mammalian cells reported by several groups (see Fig. 1; See also Refs.24Lo S.Y. Masiarz F. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. Ou J.H. Virology. 1995; 213: 455-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 25Suzuki R. Matsuura Y. Suzuki T. Ando A. Chiba J. Harada S. Saito I. Miyamura T. J. Gen. Virol. 1995; 76: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 26Liu Q. Tackney C. Bhat R.A. Prince A.M. Zhang P. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 657-662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, our data indicate that the nuclear import of core requires Ran/Gsp1p (Fig. 2), and is mediated by a specific import receptor, Kap123p (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that the core protein of HCV is transported into the nucleus via a specific transport receptor in a Ran-dependent manner.In addition, core inhibited the Kap121p-dependent nuclear import of Yap1p (Fig. 4). This inhibitory effect of core seems to involve a specialized import system, because importin α/β-dependent import of proteins with a classical NLS was not affected under the same conditions (Fig. 4 D). Our data suggested that core inhibits the interaction between Yap1p and its import receptor, Kap121p (Fig. 5), with resultant inhibition of the nuclear import of Yap1p (Fig. 4). It is unlikely that core interacts directly to Yap1p domains that included DNA-binding domain, because core could also affect nuclear localization of a limited region of the NLS of Yap1p, amino acid positions 2–59 (Fig. 4 C).Two recent reports indicate that expression of core increases cellular oxidation state (59Moriya K. Nakagawa K. Santa T. Shintani Y. Fujie H. Miyoshi H. Tsutsumi T. Miyazawa T. Ishibashi K. Horie T. Imai K. Todoroki T. Kimura S. Koike K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4365-4370PubMed Google Scholar, 60Okuda M., Li, K. Beard M.R. Showalter L.A. Scholle F. Lemon S.M. Weinman S.A. Gastroenterology. 2002; 122: 366-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). It is interesting to demonstrate if this is the case in yeast cells. Even though Yap1p is a transcription factor that is induced by oxidative stress, we could observe neither an accumulation of Yap1p in the nucleus nor an induced level of Yap1p-dependent transcription, when core was expressed in yeast cells (Fig. 4). This could be because core inhibits nuclear import step of Yap1p (this study), whereas oxidative stress inhibits nuclear export of Yap1p, leading accumulation of Yap1p in the nucleus and transcriptional activation of Yap1p (51Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 52Isoyama T. Murayama A. Nomoto A. Kuge S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21863-21869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, another indicator will be required to examine effect of core on oxidative state in yeast cells.Differences among inhibitory effects of core on Yap1p import are somewhat correlated to the cytoplasmic localization of each core protein; core 191 and core 173, which showed stronger inhibition, were both localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas core 151, which was less effective, was localized solely in the nucleus (Fig.1 B). The region that represents the difference between core 191 and core 151 might be required for the maximal inhibitory effect. It should be noted that the carboxyl-terminal region of core, amino acid positions 176–188, has leucine-rich nuclear export signal-like sequence. Core may shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by cellular nuclear import and export systems.Localization of core seems to be controversial. Recent studies indicate that core predominantly localized in cytoplasm not only in cultured cells (28Barba G Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Zs. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 29Ikeda M., Yi, M., Li, K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), but also in cells harboring HCV replicons (29Ikeda M., Yi, M., Li, K. Lemon S.M. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2997-3006Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), cells from liver biopsy samples of HCV-infected patients (30Rullier A. Trimoulet P. Urbaniak R. Winnock M. Zauli D. Ballardini G. Rosenbaum J. Balaboud C. Bioulac-Sage P. Le Bail B. Mod. Pathol. 2002; 14: 496-505Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar), as well as a HCV-infected chimpanzee (28Barba G Harper F. Harada T. Kohara M. Goulinet S. Matsuura Y. Eder G. Schaff Zs. Chapman M.J. Miyamura T. Brechot C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1200-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar). Thus, the relevance of steady-state nuclear localization of core to natural HCV infections remains in doubt. On the other hand, Kohara and co-workers (27Yasui K. Wakita T. Tsukiyama-Kohara K. Funahashi S.I. Ichikawa M. Kajita T. Moradpour D. Wands J.R. Kohara M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6048-6055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that processed form of core (p21) is identified in the nucleus only by using a specific monoclonal antibody, and that this processed form of core is also identified in the viral particles isolated from HCV-infected patients. These results suggest that specific antibody and/or condition are required to detect core in the nucleus. Nevertheless, our findings suggest that core affects cellular metabolism in the cytoplasm by disturbing specific nuclear transport, because specific binding of cargoes to its importins are carried out in the cytoplasm.In addition to the sequence homology between Kap123p and Kap121p, these receptors might have overlapping functions in nuclear import because Kap121p can substitute functionally for Kap123p in the nuclear transport of ribosomal protein L25 (38Schlenstedt G. Smirnova E. Deane R. Solsbacher J. Kutay U. Görlich D. Ponstingl H. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6237-6249Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 55Rout M.P. Blobel G. Aitchison J.D. Cell. 1997; 89: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Unlike ribosomal protein L25, core was not imported into the nucleus by Kap121p (Fig.3 C), but core did inhibit Kap121p-dependent nuclear transport (Fig. 4). Karyopherin β3 (also known as importin 5) is the mammalian orthologue of Kap121p and mediates the nuclear import of ribosomal proteins (61Jäkel S. Görlich D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4491-4502Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). It is likely that core might have an effect on karyopherin β3-dependent nuclear transport in mammalian cells. We are currently investigating this possibility. Furthermore, human importin 4 has been recently identified as a Kap123p orthologue (62Jäkel S. Mingot J.M. Schwarzmaier P. Hartmann E. Görlich D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar).Recently, Jin et al. (63Jin D.Y. Wang H.L. Zhou Y. Chun A.C.S. Kibler V. Hou K. Kung H. Jeang K.T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) reported that LZIP, a transcription factor with basic leucine zipper domain that binds cyclic AMP-responsive element, can function as a cofactor of core for transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. They indicated that core can sequester LZIP in the cytoplasm, with resultant morphological changes in NIH3T3 cells. The mechanism of sequestration of LZIP by core in the cytoplasm might be the result of inhibition of the nuclear transport of LZIP by core.In view of the conservation of nucleocytoplasmic transport between yeast and mammalian cells, it is likely that core plays a role in the nuclear transport of cellular proteins, such as transcription factors and intracellular signaling molecules, in mammalian cells. Nuclear transport is critical for gene expression and cellular responses to intracellular signals. Inhibition of nuclear import results in loss of the regulation of these events in cells, leading to destruction of the cellular metabolism that maintains homeostasis. Core might contribute to the pathogenesis of HCV by disturbing nuclear transport. Hepatitis C virus (HCV),1 a major causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis (1Choo Q.L. Kuo G. Weiner A.J. Overby L.R. Bradley D.W. Houghton M. Science. 1989; 244: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (6207) Google Scholar), is classified in a separate genus of the Flaviviridae family.

These properties of the core protein imply that it contributes to the pathogenesis of HCV by altering cellular metabolism. However, because of its complexity, the precise mechanisms responsible for the effects of the core protein (abbreviated as “core” hereafter) in the host cell remain to be elucidated. The amino-terminal half of core contains some nuclear localization signal-like (NLS-like) sequences and is strongly hydrophilic, whereas the carboxyl-terminal region is hydrophobic. The carboxyl-terminal region of core is processed to yield at least three products of different molecular masses (9Hüssy P. Langen H. Mous J. Jacobsen H.

Full-length core p23 (amino acid residues 1–191), as well as the truncated product p21, are localized both in the cytoplasm and nucleus.

Thus, the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic region of core is a determinant of the distribution of the protein between the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments.

BRCA2 is a tumor suppressor involved in early onset of breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. Both Smad3 and BRCA2 possess transcription activation domains. Here, we show that Smad3 and BRCA2 interact functionally and physically. We found that BRCA2 forms a complex with Smad3 in vitro and in vivo, and that both MH1 and MH2 domains of Smad3 contribute to the interaction. TGFbeta1 stimulates interaction of endogenous Smad3 and BRCA2 in non-transfected cells. BRCA2 co-activates Smad3-dependent transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter and expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). Smad3 increases the transcriptional activity of BRCA2 fused to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Gal4, and reciprocally, BRCA2 co-activates DBD-Gal4-Smad3. Thus, our results show that BRCA2 and Smad3 form a complex and synergize in regulation of transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2129658932,"Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) autoantibody epitopes are largely restricted to an immunodominant region (IDR) on the extracellular region of the native molecule. Localization of the IDR has been a longstanding and difficult goal. The TPO extracellular region comprises a large myeloperoxidase-like domain, linked to the plasma membrane by two smaller domains with homology to complement control protein (CCP) and epidermal growth factor (EGF), respectively. Recent studies have focused on the CCP- and EGF-like domains as the putative location of the TPO autoantibody IDR. To address this issue, we attempted to express on the surface of transfected cells native TPO in which the CCP- and EGF-like domains were deleted, either together or individually. We used a quartet of human monoclonal autoantibodies that define the TPO IDR, as well as polyclonal TPO autoantibodies in patients' sera, to detect these mutated TPO molecules by flow cytometry. The combined CCP/EGF-like domain deletion did not produce a signal with TPO autoantibodies but did not traffic to the cell surface. In contrast, both monoclonal and polyclonal autoantibodies recognized TPO with the juxtamembrane EGF-like domain deleted equally as well as the wild-type TPO on the cell surface. TPO with the CCP-like domain deleted expressed normally on the cell surface, as determined using the polyclonal mouse antiserum. Nevertheless, this modified TPO molecule was recognized very poorly by both the human monoclonal autoantibodies and the polyclonal autoantibodies in patients' sera. In conclusion, we have clearly excluded the juxtamembrane EGF-like domain as being part of the IDR. In contrast, a component of the CCP-like domain does contribute to the IDR.

A remarkable feature of polyclonal TPO autoantibodies in the sera of all patients is that their epitopes are largely directed to a restricted area on the native antigen, termed the immunodominant region (IDR)(reviewed in Ref. 4Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1253-1259Google Scholar). This epitopic profile contrasts with antibodies generated in mice by immunization with purified TPO together with adjuvant, which have a wide range of epitopes on both native and denatured TPO (5Ruf J. Toubert M. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Google Scholar). Even within the IDR, TPO autoantibodies in an individual patient maintain the same epitopic fingerprint over many years (lack of epitope spreading) (6Jaume J.C. Burek C.L. Hoffman W.H. Rose N. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 104: 115-123Google Scholar), a phenomenon that appears to have a genetic basis (7Jaume J.C. Guo J. Pauls D.L. Zakarija M. McKenzie J.M. Egeland J.A. Burek C.L. Rose N.R. Hoffman W.H. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

Some evidence supports their involvement in thyrocyte damage by antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (8Rodien P. Madec A.-M. Morel Y. Stefanutti A. Bornet H. Orgiazzi J. Autoimmunity. 1992; 13: 177-185Google Scholar, 9Guo J. Jaume J.C. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 925-931Google Scholar). Perhaps more important is the influence of antibodies complexed to antigen in modulating antigen processing with enhancement or suppression of presentation of different T cell determinants (10Simitsek P.D. Campbell D.G. Lanzavecchia A. Fairweather N. Watts C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1957-1963Google Scholar). Identification of the TPO IDR may, therefore, provide important information for understanding the immunopathological mechanism underlying autoimmune thyroiditis and may facilitate identification of molecules for immunosuppression of disease. Consequently, there has been much effort over the past decade, utilizing different approaches, to identify the precise amino acids that comprise the TPO IDR, a difficult task because of the need to work with the native molecule and the lack of information on the three-dimensional structure of TPO.TPO is a 933-amino acid residue molecule with a single membrane-spanning region (11Magnusson R.P.

The major extracellular portion of the TPO molecule (amino acid residues 1–745) has high (∼42%) homology to myeloperoxidase (MPO), an intracellular enzyme whose three-dimensional structure has been determined (14Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Google Scholar). The extracellular region of TPO also contains a juxtamembrane segment (amino acid residues 741–838) with a complement control protein (CCP)-like domain and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (13Libert F.

More recently, the CCP- and EGF-like portions of TPO have received much attention as containing a conformational B cell epitope for TPO autoantibodies (15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P.

The present study was undertaken to address the question of the relative importance of the CCP- and EGF-like domains in the IDR of TPO autoantibodies in human autoimmune thyroid disease.DISCUSSIONTPO is a highly unusual member of the peroxidase family in that it is a membrane-associated protein with its large functional region orientated toward the exterior of the thyroid follicular cell. TPO is also the primary enzyme involved in thyroid hormone synthesis, a process involving iodination of thyroglobulin stored extracellularly in the thyroid follicular lumen. Autoantibodies to the extracellular region of TPO are a sine qua non in active autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis and are also present in the majority of patients with Graves' disease, which together are the most common autoimmune diseases affecting humans. Polyclonal TPO autoantibody epitopes in all patients are largely restricted to one facet of the native molecule, the IDR with an epitopic ‘fingerprint’ that remains constant over many years and clusters in families (5Ruf J. Toubert M. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Google Scholar,31Chazenbalk G.D. Portolano S. Russo D. Hutchison J.S. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 62-74Google Scholar).Understanding the basis for this remarkable phenomenon requires, as a first step, identification of the precise TPO amino acids that comprise the IDR. This task has, however, been exceptionally difficult and has led to much data with disparate conclusions (for example, Refs.16Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Google Scholar, 17Libert F. Ludgate M. Dinsart C. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 857-860Google Scholar, 18Zanelli E. Henry M. Malthiery Y. Clin. Exp.

McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Google Scholar). The primary reason for this difficulty is that the epitopes comprising the IDR are highly conformational and almost certainly discontinuous (reviewed in Ref. 32McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Intern. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 19: 587-618Google Scholar). In addition, a number of points are frequently misunderstood, including the following. (i) Recognition of a TPO polypeptide fragment by autoantibodies in the majority of patients' sera is insufficient to establish that this fragment is part of the immunodominant region. Serum autoantibodies are polyclonal, and a signal can be obtained from the minority of autoantibodies with epitopes outside the IDR. (ii) Competition for autoantibody binding to native TPO by immune sera generated in animals may involve steric hindrance by very large molecules rather than direct overlap of epitopic sites. Competition with much smaller, monomeric and monoclonal Fab is more likely to yield reliable conclusions. (iii) Based on the closely homologous MPO three-dimensional structure (14Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Google Scholar), shown empirically by chimeric MPO-TPO studies to be similar to that of TPO (33Nishikawa T. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1000-1006Google Scholar), numerically distant amino acids in the TPO primary sequence may be closely associated in the native molecule and vice versa.The CCP/EGF-like domain of TPO is a very interesting candidate for containing, at least in large part, the autoantibody IDR. It is the most unique component of TPO, without any comparable segment in MPO (a soluble molecule not associated with the cell membrane). Indeed, considerable recent evidence has supported the concept that the CCP/EGF-like domain contains TPO autoantibody epitopes (15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P. Duthoit C. Durand-Gorde J.M. Geourjon C. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35313-35317Google Scholar, 27Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Google Scholar). Tyrosine 772 is particularly implicated as being involved in the IDR (28Estienne V. Duthoit C. Blanchin S. Montserret R. Durand-Gorde J.M. Chartier M. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 359-366Google Scholar). Although elegant, these studies have a number of limitations, having been performed with polypeptide fragments that are not necessarily in the native conformation, involving detection with polyclonal autoantibodies or competition with intact murine monoclonal antibodies (not monoclonal human autoantibodies and not Fab).In the present study, we have directly determined the interaction between human monoclonal TPO autoantibodies (expressed as Fab) with the native antigen expressed on the cell surface. Deletion of the entire CCP/EGF-like domain (amino acid residues 741–838) resulted in a TPO molecule that did not traffic normally to the cell surface. However, deletion of only the EGF-like domain was informative. Our data demonstrate that the four human monoclonal autoantibodies that define the TPO IDR, as well as polyclonal TPO autoantibodies in patients' sera, all bind to TPO-Del-EGF expressed on the cell surface as well as to the wild-type TPO. On this basis, we can definitively exclude the juxtamembrane EGF-like domain (amino acids 795–838) as being part of the TPO IDR.Individual deletion of the CCP-like domain (amino acid residues 741–794) also yielded interesting and informative data. Del-CCP (like Del-EGF) expressed normally on the cell surface, as determined using a murine polyclonal antiserum with epitopes both within and outside the TPO autoantibody IDR (30Jaume J.C. Guo J. Wang Y. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1651-1657Google Scholar). In striking contrast to Del-EGF, however, binding to Del-CCP by the four monoclonal autoantibodies to the IDR, as well as by polyclonal autoantibodies in patients' sera, was markedly diminished relative to the polyclonal mouse antiserum to TPO. Three possible explanations for this observation are the following. (i) A significant component of the IDR lies within the CCP-like region. (ii) Truncation of this region leads to steric hindrance for autoantibody binding (perhaps, in part, by bringing the major MPO domain closer to the plasma membrane). (iii) It results from a combination of these two events.Data from other studies provide insight into the foregoing issue. First, an amino acid (Lys713) in the epitope of human monoclonal autoantibody TR1.9 (one of the quartet that define the IDR) has been identified by a direct footprinting approach (26Guo J. Yan X.-M. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Google Scholar). The identification of Lys713 is consistent with previous evidence that TPO autoantibodies interact with the mAb no. 47/c21 epitopic region on TPO (amino acid residues 713–721) (16Finke R. Seto P. Ruf J. Carayon P. Rapoport B. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 919-921Google Scholar, 17Libert F. Ludgate M. Dinsart C. Vassart G. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1991; 73: 857-860Google Scholar). Lys713 is in the MPO-like domain of TPO, upstream of but closely adjacent to the CCP-like domain of TPO. Therefore, the CCP-like domain of TPO does not contain the entire autoantibody IDR. Mutation of Lys713 only slightly reduces autoantibody affinity (26Guo J. Yan X.-M. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Google Scholar). Because of the discontinuous nature of TPO autoantibody epitopes, the contact amino acids on the MPO-like region adjacent to Lys713 are unknown; it is presently not possible to precisely eliminate all the contact amino acids in the MPO-like region without severely disrupting folding and expression of the molecule. In contrast, deletion of the CCP-like region (feasible because it is a separate structural module) will eliminate all autoantibody contact amino acids within the region and will have a more marked effect on autoantibody binding.A second study 2Pichurin, P., Guo, J., Estienne, V., Carayon, P., Ruf, J., Rapoport, B., and McLachlan, S. M. (2002)Thyroid, in press. providing insight into the present observations involves TPO autoantibodies obtained by screening a human immunoglobulin gene combinatorial library on the isolated CCP/EGF-like domain of TPO. This library is rich in yielding TPO autoantibodies when screened on purified, intact TPO (34Guo J. Wang Y. Jaume J.C. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1999; 117: 19-29Google Scholar, 35Pichurin P. Guo J. Yan X. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. Thyroid. 2001; 11: 301-313Google Scholar). In contrast, only two rare IDR TPO autoantibodies were obtained with purified CCP/EGF-like polypeptide, and only on low stringency screening. These data suggest that a major component of the IDR lies within the MPO-like region of TPO. Other evidence for the importance of the MPO-like domain in the IDR is that C-terminal-truncated TPO molecules lacking the CCP/EGF-like domains of TPO (synthesized as cell-free translates) were recognized by human autoantibodies (36Xiong Z. Farilla L. Guo J. McLachlan S. Rapoport B. Thyroid. 2001; 11: 227-231Google Scholar). Finally, in the present study, the similar effect of the CCP-like domain deletion on binding of TPO autoantibody Fab (monoclonals) and intact autoantibody IgG (patients' sera) suggests that loss of part of the IDR played a greater role than steric hindrance in reducing autoantibody recognition. All these data, taken together, suggest that the TPO autoantibody IDR contains portions of the MPO- and CCP-like domains and, therefore, bridges these two domains. A conceptual diagram of this interaction is depicted in Fig.7.Figure 7Schematic representation of TPO and its structural domains. TPO, (933 amino acids; the numbering shown includes its signal peptide) is a largely extracellular protein with a single membrane-spanning region. The amino-terminal portion of TPO has high homology with myeloperoxidase (MPO) (13Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Google Scholar, 37Kimura S. Ikedo-Saito M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1988; 3: 113-120Google Scholar). TPO amino acid residues 1–121 are homologous to the MPO prosequence, and the largest TPO domain (MPO-like) corresponds to the large MPO subunit. Not present in MPO (a soluble protein not tethered to the plasma membrane) are two smaller juxtamembrane domains with homology to the complement control protein (CCP-like) and to epidermal growth factor (EGF-like) (13Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Google Scholar, 15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P. Duthoit C. Durand-Gorde J.M. Geourjon C. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35313-35317Google Scholar). Human TPO autoantibodies interact with the extracellular region of native (not denatured) TPO (reviewed in Ref. 32McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Intern. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 19: 587-618Google Scholar). The MPO prosequence-like domain does not contribute to the autoantibody binding immunodominant region (IDR) (29Nishikawa T. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1994; 79: 1648-1654Google Scholar). One amino acid, Lys713, (K713) has been determined by direct footprinting to lie within the TR1.9 mAb epitope within the IDR (26Guo J. Yan X.-M. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1327-1333Google Scholar). Therefore, the IDR lies, at least in part, within the MPO-like domain of TPO. From the known three-dimensional structure of MPO (14Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Google Scholar), TPO Lys713can be deduced to be adjacent to the CCP-like domain. There is conflicting evidence as to whether the IDR largely involves the CCP/EGF-like (15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P. Duthoit C. Durand-Gorde J.M. Geourjon C. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35313-35317Google Scholar, 27Estienne V. Duthoit C. Vinet L. Durand-Gorde J.M. Carayon P. Ruf J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8056-8062Google Scholar, 28Estienne V. Duthoit C. Blanchin S. Montserret R. Durand-Gorde J.M. Chartier M. Baty D. Carayon P. Ruf J. Int. Immunol. 2002; 14: 359-366Google Scholar) or MPO-like domains (24Hobby P. Gardas A. Radomski R. McGregor A.M. Banga J.P. Sutton B.J. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 2018-2026Google Scholar, 36Xiong Z. Farilla L. Guo J. McLachlan S. Rapoport B. Thyroid. 2001; 11: 227-231Google Scholar). The present study demonstrates for the first time that the IDR does not include the EGF-like domain. Moreover, deletion of the CCP-like domain greatly diminishes TPO autoantibody recognition of TPO. All these data taken together indicate that the TPO IDR lies at the junction of the MPO- and CCP-like domains (shaded area).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In conclusion, we have analyzed the contribution to the TPO autoantibody, IDR, of the unique CCP- and EGF-like domains of TPO that link the MPO-like domain to the plasma membrane. We have clearly excluded the juxtamembrane EGF-like domain as being part of the IDR. In contrast, a component of the CCP-like domain does contribute to the IDR. These data, together with information from other studies, localize the TPO autoantibody IDR to the junction of the CCP-like domain and the much larger MPO-like domain on TPO. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO), 1The abbreviations used are: TPO, thyroid peroxidase; IDR, immunodominant region; MPO, myeloperoxidase; CCP, complement control protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor. 1The abbreviations used are: TPO, thyroid peroxidase; IDR, immunodominant region; MPO, myeloperoxidase; CCP, complement control protein; EGF, epidermal growth factor. a heme-containing glycoprotein on the thyrocyte apical membrane that plays a key role in thyroid hormone biosynthesis, is also the dominant autoantigen in human autoimmune thyroiditis (1Czarnocka B. Ruf J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Lissitzky S. FEBS Lett. 1985; 109: 147-152Google Scholar, 2Portmann L. Hamada N. Heinrich G. DeGroot L.J. J. Clin. Endocrinol.

A remarkable feature of polyclonal TPO autoantibodies in the sera of all patients is that their epitopes are largely directed to a restricted area on the native antigen, termed the immunodominant region (IDR)(reviewed in Ref. 4Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 1253-1259Google Scholar). This epitopic profile contrasts with antibodies generated in mice by immunization with purified TPO together with adjuvant, which have a wide range of epitopes on both native and denatured TPO (5Ruf J. Toubert M. Czarnocka B. Durand-Gorde J. Ferrand M. Carayon P. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 1211-1218Google Scholar). Even within the IDR, TPO autoantibodies in an individual patient maintain the same epitopic fingerprint over many years (lack of epitope spreading) (6Jaume J.C. Burek C.L. Hoffman W.H. Rose N. McLachlan S.M. Rapoport B. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 104: 115-123Google Scholar), a phenomenon that appears to have a genetic basis (7Jaume J.C. Guo J. Pauls D.L. Zakarija M. McKenzie J.M. Egeland J.A. Burek C.L. Rose N.R. Hoffman W.H. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1999; 84: 1424-1431Google Scholar). The role of TPO autoantibodies in the pathogenesis of disease is debated. Some evidence supports their involvement in thyrocyte damage by antibody-mediated cellular cytotoxicity (8Rodien P. Madec A.-M. Morel Y. Stefanutti A. Bornet H. Orgiazzi J. Autoimmunity. 1992; 13: 177-185Google Scholar, 9Guo J. Jaume J.C. Rapoport B. McLachlan S.M. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1997; 82: 925-931Google Scholar). Perhaps more important is the influence of antibodies complexed to antigen in modulating antigen processing with enhancement or suppression of presentation of different T cell determinants (10Simitsek P.D. Campbell D.G. Lanzavecchia A. Fairweather N. Watts C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1957-1963Google Scholar). Identification of the TPO IDR may, therefore, provide important information for understanding the immunopathological mechanism underlying autoimmune thyroiditis and may facilitate identification of molecules for immunosuppression of disease. Consequently, there has been much effort over the past decade, utilizing different approaches, to identify the precise amino acids that comprise the TPO IDR, a difficult task because of the need to work with the native molecule and the lack of information on the three-dimensional structure of TPO. TPO is a 933-amino acid residue molecule with a single membrane-spanning region (11Magnusson R.P. Chazenbalk G.D. Gestautas J. Seto P. Filetti S. DeGroot L.J. Rapoport B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 856-861Google Scholar, 12Kimura S. Kotani T. McBride O.W. Umeki K. Hirai K. Nakayama T. Ohtaki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5555-5559Google Scholar, 13Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Google Scholar). The major extracellular portion of the TPO molecule (amino acid residues 1–745) has high (∼42%) homology to myeloperoxidase (MPO), an intracellular enzyme whose three-dimensional structure has been determined (14Zeng J. Fenna R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 185-207Google Scholar). The extracellular region of TPO also contains a juxtamembrane segment (amino acid residues 741–838) with a complement control protein (CCP)-like domain and an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain (13Libert F. Ruel J. Ludgate M. Swillens S. Alexander N. Vassart G. Dinsart C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 4193-4196Google Scholar, 15Estienne V. Blanchet C. Niccoli-Sire P. Duthoit C. Durand-Gorde J.M. Geourjon C. Baty D.

The APR is exemplified by α1-acid glycoprotein gene (agp) expression. A number of transcription factors, including CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ), glucocorticoid receptor, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB), and Nopp140, are known to participate in its induction. The underlying mechanism of Nopp140 and other factors for regulating agp expression remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation of Nopp140, together with C/EBPβ, inducesagp gene expression synergistically. The cooperative activation of the agp gene by Nopp140 and forskolin is sensitive to inhibition by PKI. Results from biochemical and functional characterizations of Nopp140 mutants defective in PKA phosphorylation sites suggest that PKA-dependent Nopp140 phosphorylation is important for its role in agp gene activation. Furthermore, maximal activation of the agp gene by PKA-phosphorylated Nopp140 depends on the presence of CREB and C/EBPβ. The participation of CREB in the activation is, however, independent of its PKA-mediated phosphorylation. In summary, we demonstrate the existence of a novel Nopp140-mediated PKA signaling pathway that leads to the activation of agp, one of the major acute phase response genes.

Many cAMP-response genes possess regions corresponding to the consensus sequence called cAMP-responsive elements (CREs) (18Deutsch P.J. Hoeffler J.P. Jameson J.L. Lin J.C. Habener J.F. J. Biol.

Nature. 1987; 328: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of CREB at Ser133 by PKA has been shown to mediate the expression of numerous genes (21Gonzalez G.A.

One key regulator of the agp gene, C/EBPβ, is also regulated by CREB during liver regeneration (25Niehof M. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3600-3613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been demonstrated that C/EBPβ is phosphorylated in response to cAMP (26Tae H.J. Zhang S. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21487-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in vitro phosphorylation of C/EBPβ at Ser105 by PKA has no effect on its DNA binding activity (27Trautwein C. van der Geer P. Karin M. Hunter T. Chojkier M. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 2554-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In addition to cytokines and other inducing agents, it has also been shown that AGP mRNA levels were coincidentally increased with cAMP levels in alveolar macrophages upon PGE2 treatment (28Fournier T. Riches D.W. Wiston B.W. Rose D.M. Scott K.Y. Noble P.W. Lake F.R. Henson P.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2123-2133PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that the nucleolar phosphoprotein, Nopp140, is a coactivator of C/EBPβ-mediated agp gene expression (8Lee Y.M. Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4257-4263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Nopp140 was originally defined as a shuttle protein between nucleolus and cytoplasm (29Meier U.T. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 70: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Its alternating positively and negatively charged repeat domains have also been described for targeting to the coiled bodies through p80 coilin interaction during de novosynthesis (30Isaac C. Yang Y. Meier U.T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 319-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Two classes of small nucleolar ribonuleoprotein particles and the largest subunit of RNA polymerase I can be coimmunoprecipitated with Nopp140 (31Chen H.K. Pai C.Y. Huang J.Y. Yeh N.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8536-8546Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32Yang Y. Isaac C. Wang C. Dragon F. Pogacic V. Meier U.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). These data imply that Nopp140 may be involved in the nucleologenesis and rRNA gene transcription. Recent studies by Isaac et al. (33Isaac C. Pollard J.W. Meier U.T. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4253-4264Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicate that overexpression of Nopp140 leads to the presence of a nuclear endoplasmic reticulum-like structure (R-rings) in COS cells. R-rings are the unique membrane cisternae distinct from nuclear envelope, nucleoli, or coiled bodies. Immunofluorescence staining showed that Nopp140 seems to redirect several of its associated proteins, like fibrillarin, NAP57, and p80 coilin to this structure (32Yang Y. Isaac C. Wang C. Dragon F. Pogacic V. Meier U.T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite these results, the functional roles of Nopp140 in regulation of gene expression remain to be determined. Although Nopp140 has been demonstrated as a casein kinase II (CKII)-interacting protein and to be phosphorylated by CKII in vitro (34Li D. Meier U.T. Dobrowolska G. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3773-3779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), other potential kinases that regulate its biological activities remain unknown. Earlier evidence has shown that a phosphoprotein pp135 (i.e. Nopp140) as well as nucleolin undergo extensive phosphorylation when rats were treated with isoprenaline to stimulate PKA activity (35Hoffmann J. Schwoch G. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 785-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, Nopp140 may play some roles in cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. In this study, we present data showing that Nopp140 can regulateagp gene expression in a PKA-dependent manner. We report that forskolin and Nopp140 activate the AGP promoter synergistically. Furthermore, Nopp140 can serve as a substrate for PKAin vitro and in vivo. Mutation of these phosphorylation sites reduces the synergistic activation ofagp gene expression by Nopp140 and forskolin. Since the induction is promoter-specific and cis-element-dependent and is further activated in the presence of both CREB and C/EBPβ, these data suggest a novel regulatory mechanism exerted by Nopp140 to modulate agp gene transcription. The wild type as well as the mutant AGP-CAT constructs, CMV-C/EBPβ (LAP), and CMV-LIP were described previously (9Lee Y.M. Tsai W.H. Lai M.Y. Chen D.S. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 432-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). CMV-Nopp140, pRSET-Nopp140, and GST-Nopp140 constructs were as described (11Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Plasmids expressing CREB were constructed by inserting its cDNA into pRSET 2B vector (Invitrogen). cDNA of CKIIα was obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and cloned into pCRII TA vector (Invitrogen). The recombinant cDNA from pCRII was then subcloned into FLAG cloning plasmid. cDNA along with the FLAG sequence were subsequently excised and cloned into CMV plasmid (Promega). TFIIB expression plasmid was a generous gift from Dr. B. Emerson (The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, CA). The 3pBS-CAT reporter was obtained from Dr. Y. Lin (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). FLAG-tagged Nopp140 (FLAG-Nopp140) was obtained by inserting the corresponding cDNA into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pCMV-Tag2B (Stratagene). The Nopp140 mutants (S113A, S627A, S628A, and S113A,S627A) were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis by a two-step PCR technique as described (36Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To amplify the template for mutant construction, oligonucleotides 5′-C AAG CGA GCCGCT TTG CCT CAG-3′, 5′-G AAA AGG GCA GCT TCC CCT TT-3′, 5′-A AGG GCA TCT GCC CCT TTC CG-3′, and their corresponding reversed sequences were used as primers in combination with T7 and SP6, respectively. The Nopp140 (S113A,S627A) double mutant was then obtained using Nopp140 (S627A) plasmid as the template for PCR. These mutants were all confirmed by DNA sequencing. FLAG-Nopp140 (S627A) mutant was also constructed by inserting the mutant cDNA into pCMV-Tag2B vector. GST Nopp140 deletion mutants (BS, SS, and SR) were created by inserting BamHI/SacI,SacI/SacI, SacI/EcoRI fill-in fragments of Nopp140 into the pGEX plasmids (AmershamBiosciences). The GST Nopp140 BSR construct was prepared by an in frame deletion of the internal SacI/SacI fragment from full-length GST Nopp140 vector. Recombinant Nopp140, C/EBPβ (LAP), and CREB were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and then purified over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen). Recombinant TFIIB was also induced in the same E. coli strain and further purified through a phosphocellulose column. GST-Nopp140 BS, SS, SR, BS2, and BSR deletion clones were expressed in E. coli DH5α and immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose affinity resin for kinase reaction. Baby hamster kidney (BHK) and human embryonic kidney 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Before transfection, the BHK or 293T cells were passaged onto 6-cm Petri dishes for growing to ∼30–50% confluence. Transfection of cells was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation method (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). The amounts of CAT reporter and expression vectors for transfection were detailed in each figure legend. Transfection efficiency was normalized by co-transfection with 0.5 μg/plate of RSV-β-Gal. pCDNA3 plasmid was added to each reaction to adjust the total DNA to ∼2.5 μg/plate. After the addition of DNA mixtures, the cells were incubated at 37 °C for about 24 h. To activate the PKA pathway of BHK cells, the cells were changed to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum supplemented with 20 μm forskolin (Sigma) in Me2SO. Cells were harvested 16–24 h after transfection. The whole cell lysates were used for β-galactosidase and CAT assays. The CAT activities were determined using an image analyzer (FujiX BAS1000). The relative CAT activity was normalized against β galactosidase activity. All transfection experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated at least twice. FLAG-Nopp140-transfected cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline buffer once and then treated with 50 μm forskolin in serum-free medium. After incubation for 30 min, protein lysates from forskolin-treated or untreated cells were prepared by direct lysis with 9 m urea to prevent the degradation of Nopp140 polypeptide. Subsequently, the protein extracts were diluted with binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.2m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin plus pepstatin) to 0.3 murea concentration. Immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C, 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the binding buffer, and a small aliquot was subjected to immunoblot analysis with monoclonal antibodies to FLAG and tubulin α (NeoMarkers) and polyclonal antibody to serine 133-phosphorylated CREB (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Western blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (11Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Purified recombinant proteins (Nopp140, C/EBPβ, and CREB) and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) were incubated with the kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 200 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing bovine PKA (Sigma). Purified Nopp140 was also incubated with kinase buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 200 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP) containing CKII (New England Biolabs). In solid phase kinase reactions, GST-Nopp140 together with truncated mutants of the fusion protein were immobilized onto glutathione beads using TE buffer followed by washing twice with the same buffer. The beads were subsequently washed with the kinase buffer once before initiating the PKA reaction (30 °C for 30 min). The phosphorylated polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining and autoradiography. The relative kinase activities were quantitated using image analyzer (FujiX). Nuclear extracts of BHK and 293T transfected cells for the gel mobility shift assay were prepared according to the modified procedures detailed elsewhere (38Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclear pellets collected from hypotonic lysis procedures were extracted with the same buffer containing 0.25% or 0.1% Triton X-100 once. The extracted pellet was then used for preparation of nuclear extracts. The gel retardation assays were performed as described (5Chang C.J. Chen T.T. Lei H.Y. Chen D.S. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 12: 6642-6653Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide of D motif (200 ng) was used as the probe and labeled with Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The probe (∼1 ng) was incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extracts for 20 min in the presence of 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). For oligonucleotide competition assay, 50-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was incubated with the binding mixtures. For supershift assay, 1 μl of control antibody or monoclonal antibody against C/EBPβ was added later to the incubation. The relative shifted signals were quantitated using an image analyzer (FujiX). GST-Nopp140 deletion constructs phosphorylated by PKA in vitro and FLAG-Nopp140 protein purified from 293T cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The gel containing target polypeptides was excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with 50 ng of modified trypsin (Promega), as described previously (39Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The enzyme digests were dried in a Speed-Vac (Savant) and kept at −20 °C until use. The sample was separated by capillary HPLC (ABI 140D HPLC; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in-line coupled with the LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan). The mass spectra of the eluted peptides were collected by the “triple play” method (39Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The acquired mass spectra were analyzed by a SEQUEST browser to correlate the MS/MS spectrum with the amino acid sequence of rat Nopp140 protein. Both an in-house program and the EXPLORE program (Finnigan) were used to identify the phosphopeptides as well as to evaluate the phosphorylation sites using the method by Tsay et al. (39Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The cAMP/PKA pathway has been implicated in the gene expression of a number of acute phase proteins (40Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 41Pelletier N. Boudreau F., Yu, S.J. Zannoni S. Boulanger V. Asselin C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 275-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To explore whether the PKA pathway plays a role in regulation of the α1-acid glycoprotein gene (agp), we performed transient transfection experiments. The CAT reporter plasmid containing the AGP promoter from −180 to +20 was transiently transfected into BHK cells. When the transfected cells were treated with 20 μmforskolin, the CAT activity increased (Fig.1 A). This activation was abrogated by coexpression of PKI, a specific inhibitor of PKA. In contrast, no such forskolin-mediated gene activation was observed when a reporter plasmid containing p53-binding elements was tested (data not shown). These results indicate that the AGP promoter could be specifically activated by the PKA signaling pathway. To examine the possible involvement of Nopp140 in the forskolin-induced activation, we performed a transfection experiment with the Nopp140 expression vector and AGP-CAT in the presence of forskolin. When AGP-CAT was co-transfected with Nopp140, the CAT activity was activated (∼4.5-fold, Fig. 1 A). This activation was further augmented by the treatment with forskolin (12-fold, Fig.1 A). In addition, the synergistic effect could be reversed by an overexpression of PKI in the presence of forskolin. When we overexpressed both Nopp140 and PKI, the relative CAT activity appeared to be unaffected in the absence of forskolin treatment. To further confirm the specificity of PKA and Nopp140 co-activation of theagp gene, we performed co-transfection of the Nopp140 and CKIIα expression plasmid (a prominent kinase that phosphorylates Nopp140 in vitro). The further activation of theagp gene by Nopp140 was not observed by the addition of CKIIα (Fig. 1 B, upper left panel). The kinase activity of transfected CKIIα was verified by immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG (M2) beads and subsequent in vitro kinase assay with Nopp140 as the substrate (Fig. 1 B, lower left panel). The level of FLAG-CKIIα was determined by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B, right panel). This result suggests that the activity of CKII was not involved in the Nopp140-mediated activation of the AGP promoter. Furthermore, neither Nopp140 nor forskolin had synergistic activation effect on the p53-responsive promoter (i.e. 3pBS-CAT) (data not shown). When forskolin treatment was replaced by co-transfection of PKAc expression plasmid into BHK cells, the stimulation of AGP-CAT was also evident (data not shown). When we used the PKA-defective cell line F9 for the same assay, Nopp140-dependent activation was not observed (Fig. 1 C). Together, these results indicate that functional synergism between Nopp140 and PKA is dependent on a specific promoter. The observed synergistic activation of AGP-CAT by Nopp140 and forskolin raised the possibility that Nopp140 might be the target of PKA. This was verified by incubation of recombinant His tag Nopp140 with bovine PKA in the in vitro kinase assay. An intense phosphorylation signal was detected when wild-type Nopp140 was treated with PKA (Fig.2 A, lane 6). The transcription factor C/EBPβ and a general transcription factor TFIIB were also phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, albeit to a lesser extent (Fig. 2 A,lanes 5 and 7). TFIIB is a general transcription factor that has been found to directly interact with Nopp140 in vitro (11Miau L.H. Chang C.J. Tsai W.H. Lee S.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 230-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). When the phosphorylation of Nopp140 and TFIIB were compared quantitatively, Nopp140 is a better substrate of PKA than TFIIB in terms of phosphorylation efficiency. To further demonstrate that Nopp140 is an efficient substrate for PKA, the time course of Nopp140 phosphorylation by PKA has been assessed (Fig. 2 B). The phosphorylations of CREB by PKA and of Nopp140 by CKII were included for comparison. Under the same assay conditions, bovine serum albumin was not efficiently phosphorylated by PKA. In contrast, the phosphorylation of CREB by PKA reached the plateau within 10 min, whereas the kinetics of Nopp140 phosphorylation by PKA and CKII behaves similarly (Fig. 2 B, upperand lower panels). In terms of stoichiometry, Nopp140 appears to be a better substrate than CREB (Fig. 2 B,lower panel). Nopp140 is phosphorylated to a higher level than CREB per molecule. The number of PKA phosphorylation sites of Nopp140 is at least twice as many as that of CREB, which contains a single site, Ser133 (21Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Nopp140 by CKII is much better than its phosphorylation by PKA. This may reflect that the number of sites phosphorylated by CKII in Nopp140 is more than that by PKA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that forskolin and Nopp140 can activate AGP-CAT reporter synergistically. The synergism may be attributed to Nopp140 phosphorylation by PKA. To further explore the role of PKA-mediated phosphorylation, we first employ an LC/MS/MS approach to map the phosphorylation sites of Nopp140. First, we constructed several GST-fused Nopp140 deletion constructs to locate the region(s) where phosphorylation may occur. These Nopp140 deletion constructs were immobilized to glutathione beads and then incubated with PKA. Recombinant proteins covering the regions spanning from amino acid 1 to 169 (GST-BS) and 371 to 704 (GST-SR), but not the control GST protein, were phosphorylated by PKA (Fig.3 A). Together, this result shows that at least two PKA phosphorylation sites are present in Nopp140. One was near the N-terminal region, whereas the other one was located at the C-terminal half. Consistent with PKA phosphorylation consensus sequence search (Fig. 3 B, underlined), all four putative sites were exclusively located outside the region of GST-SS protein (Fig. 3 A). Due to the low stability of the intact form of full-length GST-Nopp140 fusion protein during in vitro glutathione bead binding, these deletion constructs were used subsequently to map their phosphorylation sites. Three GST-Nopp140 proteins, BS, BS2, and SR, were used as substrates for PKA. The phosphorylated fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, stained with Coomassie Blue, and then excised for in-gel trypsin digestion. The tryptic peptides were analyzed by LC/MS/MS. Using the SEQUEST program for initial analysis, we had nearly 80–90% of peptide coverage (Fig. 3 B, boldface characters). One candidate phosphopeptide of Nopp140 SR protein was initially screened out. It is singly phosphorylated625RASSPFRR632. Inspection of the collision-induced dissociation spectrum showed that there existed two pairs of b3 and y5 ions with distinct sizes, b3-y5 and b3*-y5* (Fig.3 C). The presence of the former pair suggested a phosphorylated Ser627, whereas the latter one suggested that Ser628 was phosphorylated. Compared with the relative abundance of two ion pairs, the Ser627 residue seems to the better site for PKA phosphorylation in vitro. Nevertheless, it appears that both Ser627 and Ser628 are phosphorylated by PKA. We utilized the selected ion tracing method (39Tsay Y.G. Wang Y.H. Chiu C.M. Shen B.J. Lee S.C. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) for a more comprehensive study of the other phosphorylated peptides/residues. This analysis identified a second phosphopeptide from Nopp140 BS protein. This peptide is singly phosphorylated111RASLPQHAGK120, whose collision-induced dissociation spectrum contains a dominant 524.0m/z ion (Fig. 3 D). The presence of this signature fragment ion indicated this peptide was indeed phosphorylated. Since Ser113 is the only potential phosphorylation residue within the sequence, it should be an unambiguous phosphorylated site. We also examined the phosphorylation of two Nopp140 deletion mutants, BS and SR (Fig. 3 E). The time course studies of GST-BS and GST-SR by PKA indicated the kinetic behavior for BS is very similar to that of CREB, whereas SR is similar to Nopp140 (compare Fig.2 B and Fig. 3 E). The results are consistent with the notion that there is one single PKA site in BS and at least two sites in SR, as identified by mass spectrum analysis. We have also performed the LC/MS/MS analysis of Nopp140 phosphorylated by CKII. None of the peptides corresponding to Ser113 and Ser627/Ser628 were phosphorylated (data not shown). This is a striking contrast to the phosphorylation of both peptides by PKA when analyzed by a parallel experiment. In summary, at least three PKA specific sites of Nopp140 have been identified in our experiment. Whereas Nopp140 is a hig"

In this study we report the interesting and unexpected result that actinomycin D increased the expression of FADD protein, and we demonstrate that other cellular stresses like ultraviolet irradiation or heat shock could also increase FADD levels in hepatocytes. In cells treated with actinomycin D, FADD levels were elevated homogeneously in the cytoplasm. The increase in cytoplasmic FADD protein by actinomycin D or FADD overexpression alone both correlated with cell death, and specific antisense inhibition of FADD expression consistently diminished ∼30% of the cell death induced by actinomycin D.

Actinomycin D (Act D)1 has been used experimentally in models of hepatic damage because it is both directly toxic to hepatocytes and sensitizes the liver to induction of apoptosis by death receptor ligands (4Leist M.

Although transcriptional inhibition has been proposed as the mechanism for the effects of Act D, it has not been proven that this mechanism alone accounted for the direct toxicity or the sensitization of hepatocytes to receptor-mediated death. Fas-associating deathdomain/mediator ofreceptor-induced toxicity (FADD/MORT1) is a cytoplasmic adaptor molecule that is required for the initiation of apoptosis signal transduction initiated by ligands that bind to the death receptors (7Chinnaiyan A.M.

FADD is a 29-kDa intracellular protein that contains two protein-protein interaction domains: a death domain (DD) and a death effector domain (DED) (8Boldin M.P. Varfolomeev E.E. Pancer Z. Mett I.L.

There the DD of FADD interacts with the DD of a death receptor or another linker molecule, TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD) (11Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M.

Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Activated caspases can then cleave downstream substrates that transmit and amplify the programmed cell death signal. Cleavage of procaspase-3 propagates the cellular and nuclear apoptotic signal (16Hengartner M.O. Nature. 2000; 407: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (6296) Google Scholar), and cleavage of BID by caspase-8 activates the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in hepatocytes (17Yin X.M. Wang K. Gross A. Zhao Y. Zinkel S. Klocke B. Roth K.A. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1999; 400: 886-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Because of the essential role of FADD in the most proximal mechanisms to activate ligand-induced apoptosis, we hypothesized that FADD levels would be a determinant of cell death in hepatocytes. We also tested the possibility that significant elevations in FADD levels alone, even in the absence of death ligands, would be adequate to induce death by cellular stresses. We measured hepatocyte viability and FADD protein levels in response to Act D, cycloheximide (CHX), ultraviolet irradiation (UV), heat shock, and specific expression of wild-type or antisense FADD. This study suggests that the modulation of endogenous FADD consisted of a highly regulated mechanism that can influence the ultimate demise of the cell exposed to toxic stresses. Williams Medium E, penicillin, streptomycin,l-glutamine, and HEPES were purchased from Invitrogen. Insulin was purchased from Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN). Low endotoxin calf serum was from HyClone Laboratories (Logan, UT). Pan-caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk) and caspase-8 inhibitor Ac-Ile-Glu-Thr-Asp-CHO (IETD-CHO) were from Alexis Corp. (San Diego, CA). Stock solution of Z-VAD-fmk was prepared at 100 mm in dimethyl sulfoxide, and stock IETD-CHO was prepared in water at 100 mm. Mouse recombinant TNFα was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies used for this study were purchased from Sigma (for α-actin), Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) (for TRADD), and Stressgen (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) (for FADD, caspase-3, and caspase-8). To ensure the specificity of the antibody used to detect FADD, the rat FADD gene was cloned (GenBankTM accession no. AF406779) and expressed by transient transfection in 293 human kidney cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen). A 29-kDa rat FADD protein was detected by Western blotting with the anti-mouse FADD antibody (data not shown). Rabbit polyclonal antibody for BID was a generous gift from Dr. Xiao-Ming Yin. Bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein and SupersignalTMchemiluminescent protein detection reagents were from Pierce. Unless otherwise indicated, all other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Primary hepatocytes were isolated and purified from male Sprague-Dawley rats (Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) or C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) by a collagenase perfusion method as described previously (18Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar, 19Stadler J. Bergonia H.A., Di Silvio M. Sweetland M.A. Billiar T.R. Simmons R.L. Lancaster Jr., J.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 4-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Highly purified hepatocytes (>98% purity and >95% viability by trypan blue exclusion) were suspended in Williams' E medium supplemented with 10% calf serum, 1 μm insulin, 2 mml-glutamine, 15 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on collagen-coated tissue culture plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/ml/well in 12-well plates for cell viability analysis, or 5 × 106 cells/5 ml/10-cm dish for Western blotting assays. Cells were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Apoptosis was induced by incubating the hepatocytes with culture medium containing 2000 units/ml TNFα and 200 ng/ml Act D for 8–12 h. Hepatocytes were then scraped off the plates and centrifuged. For cytosolic lysates, cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and resuspended in 5-fold volume of hypotonic buffer A (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After three cycles of freezing and thawing, cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was used as a cytosolic lysate for Western blotting analysis. Protein concentration was determined using BCA assay (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. All procedures in this experiment were performed according to the guidelines of the Council on Animal Care at the University of Pittsburgh and the National Research Council's Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Sterile Act D (15 μg/kg) or saline was injected via the dorsal penis vein into Sprague-Dawley rats under brief isoflurane anesthesia, and the livers were harvested 24 h later. Serum samples were obtained at the time of death, and the liver function tests were determined for aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase using the Opera Clinical Chemistry System (Bayer Co., Tarrytown, NY). Liver samples were minced by cryostat and prepared as for cultured hepatocytes. Isolated hepatocyte protein lysates were assessed by Western blotting and probed for FADD protein. Acid-cleaned, 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane, 0.25% glutaraldehyde, collagen-1-coated (50 μg/ml; Vitrogen 100, Palo Alto, CA) coverslips were prepared using a modified protocol (20McGuire R.F. Bissell D.M. Boyles J. Roll F.J. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes were plated on coverslips overnight and treated with TNFα (2000 units/ml) and Act D (200 ng/ml). Six hours after treatment, hepatocytes were fixed for 20 min in ice-cold methanol. Apoptosis was measured by using the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling assay (TUNEL; Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as per manufacturer's instructions. The specimens were washed twice in PBS. Ten microliters of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase reaction mixture containing cobalt chloride and biotinylated dUTP were added to the slides and incubated at 37 °C for 90 min. Slides were then washed with PBS three times and labeled with streptavidin-conjugated Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for detection of DNA strand breaks. Cells were washed in bovine serum albumin solution (0.15 g of glycine, 0.5 g of bovine serum albumin in 100 ml of 1× PBS). Coverslips were blocked in 5% goat serum (Sigma) in bovine serum albumin for 45 min and washed. Cells were probed with rabbit anti-FADD polyclonal antibody (1:4000, Stressgen) for 1 h, washed, and then incubated with Cy3-linked goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:3000; Jackson Immunolabs). Cells were washed and nuclei were stained for 30 s with Hoechst 33325 (blue, 2 μg/ml in water) or Sytox stain (green; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Coverslips were mounted onto glass slides using water-soluble mounting medium (Gelvatol; Monsanto, St. Louis, MO). Images were collected with a 40× objective together with multipass fluorescence to ensure optimal image registration. The image collection system was a Provis microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), a high sensitivity, integrating three-chip color camera (Sony Corp, Park Ridge, NJ), a frame grabber board (Coreco Inc., Saint-Laurent, Quebec, Canada), and Optimus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). All images were collected with the same camera and microscope settings (three frames of integration) with neutral density fields. Hepatocytes were washed twice with PBS and exposed to UV using a Philips Westinghouse FS40T12 ultraviolet lamp (peak wavelengths 290–330) calibrated with a UVX digital radiometer and UVX-31 probe (UVP, San Gabriel, CA). After exposure to UV, fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cell viability was determined by the crystal violet method as described previously (21Li J. Bombeck C.A. Yang S. Kim Y.M. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17325-17333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 30% ethanol and 3% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. Plates were washed six times with tap water. After drying, cells were lysed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution, and dye uptake was measured at 550 nm using a 96-well microplate reader. Cell viability was calculated from relative dye intensity of the mean for duplicate samples and presented as percentages relative to untreated samples. Cell viability is presented with the representative Western blotting results from the same hepatocyte harvest. Forty micrograms of protein were separated on 13% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Loading of equal protein amounts was assessed by staining of nitrocellulose membranes with 0.1% Ponceau S (Sigma) in 5% acetic acid. Nonspecific binding was blocked with PBS-T (14 mmsodium phosphate (monobasic, monohydrate), 88 mm dibasic sodium phosphate (anhydrous), 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk for 1 h of incubation with agitation at room temperature. Anti-FADD (1:4000), anti-caspase-8 (1:1000), anti-BID (1:1000), anti-TRADD (1:1000), or anti-α-actin (1:1000) antibodies were added. After 1-h incubation at room temperature with agitation, membranes were washed three times with PBS-T. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) was incubated at 1:10,000 for 1 h at room temperature. Following five washes with PBS-T, the protein bands were visualized with SupersignalTM (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The bands were visualized on Kodak film (Eastman Kodak) exposed to the membrane to detect chemiluminescence signals. Intensity of bands was assessed by computer analysis using UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific, Orem, UT). E1- and E3-deleted Ad-FADD-WT and Ad-FADD-AS were constructed through Cre-lox recombination with reagents provided by Dr. S. Hardy (Somatix, Alameda, CA). AnXhoI/XhoI 720-bp murine FADD cDNA coding region (isolated from PCImMort1 FL; generously provided by Dr. Astar Winoto) was inserted into the shuttle vector pAdlox with CMV promoter in forward and reverse direction to create wild type (WT) and antisense (AS) expression vectors, respectively. Recombinant adenovirus was generated by cotransfection of SfiI-digested pAdlox-FADD and Psi5 helper virus DNA into the Ad packaging cell line CRE8 that expressed Cre recombinase as previously described (22Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses were propagated on CRE8 or 293 cells and purified by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and subsequent dialysis. Titers of viral particles were determined by optical densitometry, and recombinant viruses were stored in 3% sucrose at −80 °C. The presence of the viral transgene product FADD was confirmed by Western blot analysis of infected hepatocytes. Plaque-forming units (PFU) were estimated at 100 particles/PFU. Ad-EGFP was constructed and obtained as described previously (23Takahashi Y. Geller D.A. Gambotto A. Watkins S.C. Fung J.J. Murase N. Surgery. 2000; 128: 345-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and Ad-Psi5 was a gift from S. Hardy. For adenoviral FADD gene transduction of hepatocytes, recombinant adenovirus was added to PBS-washed hepatocytes cultures at increasing multiplicities of infection (m.o.i. = number of PFU/cell) in serum-free Opti-MEM. Cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Following this, cells were washed twice with PBS and fresh medium containing 10% calf serum was added. Isolation of total RNA and Northern blot analysis of rFADD mRNA levels in cultured hepatocytes were performed using the 720-base pair rat FADD cDNA coding region as a DNA probe as described previously (24Kim Y.M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31138-31148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (799) Google Scholar). Northern blots were probed in ExpressHyb hybridization solution (CLONTECH), according to the instructions of the manufacturer, using radiolabeled rFADD cDNA (GenBankTM accession no. AF406779) or β-actin (CLONTECH). Equal RNA was loaded as assessed by quantitation with UV spectrophotometry and measurement of 28 and 18 S ribosomal RNA. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of the mean of at least three separate experiments except where results of blots are shown, in which case a representative experiment is depicted in the figure. Comparisons between values were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SigmaStat. Differences were considered significant at p values ≤ 0.05. Previous studies have shown that hepatocyte death cannot be induced by TNFα unless used in conjunction with sensitizing agents such as Act D (25Leist M. Gantner F. Bohlinger I. Germann P.G. Tiegs G. Wendel A. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 1778-1788PubMed Google Scholar). We tested the hypothesis that Act D influenced cell death by altering FADD protein expression. Act D alone induced a concentration-dependent decline in hepatocyte viability that was associated with a dose-dependent increase in FADD protein levels (Fig. 1 A). FADD levels were also up-regulated by Act D in a time-dependent manner, which inversely correlated with viability (Fig. 1 B). The increase in FADD levels was observed as early as 4 h after Act D (200 ng/ml) treatment, with up to 5-fold increase in FADD protein levels that seemed to plateau after 8 h. Exposure to TNFα alone had minimal effects on hepatocyte viability, but when added with Act D, TNFα further reduced viability from 49 ± 5.2% to 37 ± 11.2% (Fig. 1 C). TNFα alone did not significantly increase FADD levels and did not alter the Act D-induced increases in FADD. As expected, cell death by Act D was associated with a decrease in procaspase-8 and increase in caspase-8 and caspase-3 cleavage bands without changes in TRADD or α-actin levels (Fig. 1 C), although there was a slight increase in TRADD levels with Act D and TNFα treatment in combination. TNFα with the transcriptional inhibitor d-galactosamine has been reported to increase FADD mRNA and protein levels in hepatocytes in vivo (26Zhang G. Zhou X. Wang C. Yao M., Yu, H. Xie Q. Zhonghua Ganzangbing Zazhi. 2001; 9: 10-12Google Scholar). To determine whether Act D would increase FADD in vivo, FADD protein levels were measured in liver lysates from rats injected intravenously with Act D (15 μg/kg). Fig. 1 D demonstrates a marked increase in FADD levels 24 h after Act D injection. At this time point, no changes in liver morphology or serum liver enzymes were observed (data not shown). To assess whether Act D also affected FADD mRNA levels, Northern blots were performed on total RNA isolated from hepatocytes treated with Act D. We used the 720-bp rat FADD cDNA coding region as a probe for Northern blotting. In contrast to protein levels, hepatocyte FADD mRNA levels were decreased 6 h after treatment with Act D (200 ng/ml; Fig. 2). This result suggested that FADD protein up-regulation occurred at the post-transcriptional level. β-Actin levels were also decreased in hepatocytes treated with Act D consistent with the action of Act D as a transcriptional inhibitor, but 28 and 18 S RNA levels in each lane showed equivalent total RNA loading. To determine whether the up-regulation of FADD was associated with changes in the subcellular localization of FADD, light and immunofluorescent microscopic imaging studies of the cells were undertaken. Unstimulated hepatocytes remained adherent to collagen-coated plates as a semiconfluent monolayer (Fig. 2 A). Hepatocytes stimulated for 12 h with Act D displayed characteristics of apoptotic cell death, including cell shrinkage and nuclear condensation, and detached from the plate (Fig. 2 B). Unstimulated hepatocytes analyzed by immunofluorescent staining for FADD protein exhibited a cytoplasmic distribution of FADD protein (Fig. 2 C). A homogeneous increase in FADD immunofluorescent staining was observed in the cytoplasm in hepatocytes treated with Act D for 6 h (Fig.2 D) that was consistent with the increase in FADD protein observed by Western blotting (Fig. 1 A). These localization studies demonstrated that the increase in cytoplasmic FADD levels did not involve translocation of protein from a sequestered, intracellular source. These studies demonstrated that Act D treatment of hepatocytes would result in increased FADD expression, but the role of elevated FADD protein in the activation of cell death pathways in primary hepatocytes was unclear. FADD overexpression has been shown to induce death in the B lymphoma cell line BJAB and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, as well as embryonic fibroblasts (7Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F. O'Rourke K. Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4961-4965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar, 27Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L.

Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). To evaluate whether overexpression of FADD protein alone would activate death pathways in primary hepatocytes, we constructed a replication-deficient adenovirus that expressed wild type mouse FADD (Ad-FADD-WT). Fluorescent analysis of hepatocytes infected with a control virus that expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein (Ad-EGFP) at m.o.i. of 10 resulted in >90% infectivity without induction of cell death (Fig. 2 E). Ad-FADD-WT infection of hepatocytes resulted in an increase in FADD immunofluorescent staining in the cytoplasm and condensed, apoptotic nuclear and cellular morphology (Fig. 2 H) compared with infection with control virus (Fig. 2 F) or medium alone (Fig.2 G). Higher magnification of hepatocytes treated with Act D showed nuclei with condensed apoptotic morphology (Fig. 2 J). To assess for DNA fragmentation, cells treated with Act D (Fig.2 L) showed an increase in TUNEL-positive staining compared with untreated hepatocytes (Fig. 2 K). These results demonstrate that Act D treatment or overexpression of FADD could induce an apoptotic cytoplasmic and nuclear morphology in hepatocytes. To assess the molecular effects of FADD overexpression, we examined the cleavage of procaspase-8 and Bid, which are molecules immediately downstream of FADD in the apoptotic signaling pathway. Eight hours following Ad-FADD-WT infection at m.o.i. 10, FADD protein expression was significantly increased in hepatocytes, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 4 A). Cleavage products of caspase-8 and BID (tBID) were seen 18 h after Ad-FADD-WT infection but not after Ad-EGFP infection (Fig. 3 A). To quantitate the cell death induced by FADD overexpression, infection of hepatocytes with Ad-FADD-WT resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in viability of hepatocytes (Fig. 3 B), which was similar to results after treatment with Act D (Fig. 1 A). Ad-FADD-WT infection at m.o.i. 10 induced a reduction in cell viability to ∼58% compared with controls (Fig. 3 C, lane 3). As expected, death by Ad-FADD-WT infection was inhibited by co-culture with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) or by caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-CHO (100 μm) (Fig.3 C, lanes 5 and 6, respectively; n = 4, ANOVA p < 0.05). TNFα alone did not induce death in hepatocytes, nor did it augment the cytotoxic effects of Ad-FADD-WT at m.o.i. of 10.Figure 3Adenoviral expression of wild type FADD induced cell death in rat hepatocytes. A, FADD protein expression was observed 4, 8, and 18 h after a 4-h infection with Ad-FADD-WT at m.o.i. of 10. Control virus Ad-EGFP did not induce expression of FADD 18 h after infection. The activated, cleaved forms of caspase-8 and BID (tBID) were observed in cells infected with Ad-FADD-WT, but not in cells infected with Ad-EGFP. B, increasing m.o.i. of Ad-FADD-WT decreased viability of hepatocytes compared with Ad-EGFP infection as measured by crystal violet staining. Control virus Ad-EGFP did not induce hepatocyte death in the same range of m.o.i. (n = 3). C, expression of wild type FADD by infection with Ad-FADD-WT at m.o.i. 10 for 4 h induced cell death in hepatocytes. Eighteen hours after Ad-FADD-WT infection, ∼60% of cells were viable. Co-culture with pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (100 μm) or caspase-8 inhibitor IETD-CHO (100 μm) suppressed cell death by FADD expression (n = 4; p < 0.05). Expression of FADD and addition of TNFα (2000 units/ml) did not kill hepatocytes more than Ad-FADD-WT alone. Control virus infection with Ad-Psi5 (empty adenovirus) or culture with TNFα alone did not induce hepatocyte death.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the hepatotoxicity induced by Act D was dependent on FADD protein expression, an adenoviral vector expressing FADD antisense mRNA (Ad-FADD-AS) was constructed. Infection of hepatocytes with Ad-FADD-AS decreased endogenous FADD protein levels at day 3 after infection (Fig.4 A), which demonstrated the efficacy of the Ad-FADD-AS construct to abrogate FADD expression. Cell viability was not significantly changed in cells treated with Ad-FADD-AS at an m.o.i. of 10 (Fig. 4 B, lane 3). Ad-FADD-AS infection inhibited cell death by TNFα/Act D (Fig. 4 B, lane 7; n= 4, ANOVA p < 0.05) or Act D alone (Fig.4 B, lane 6; ANOVA p < 0.05) by ∼30%. These results suggested that death induced by Act D alone was at least partially FADD-dependent. We wanted to determine whether other cytotoxic stimuli could also affect FADD expression levels. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation has been shown to induce apoptosis in several cell types via a FADD-dependent mechanism that involves cross-linking of death receptors such as Fas or TNF receptor (28Sheikh M.S. Antinore M.J. Huang Y. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2555-2563Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Rehemtulla A. Hamilton C.A. Chinnaiyan A.M. Dixit V.M. J. Biol.

To assess whether FADD levels also correlated with UV exposure in hepatocytes, FADD protein levels were assessed after UV treatment and found to be increased as soon as 6 h after exposure to 200 mJ/cm2UV (Fig. 5 A). Hepatocytes exhibited a dose-dependent increase in FADD protein measured at 8 h after exposure to UV (Fig. 5 B). The lowest exposure associated with a rise in FADD levels (50 mJ/cm2) was associated with a 50% decrease in cell viability by 8 h after UV exposure. UV and Act D m"
https://openalex.org/W2029247976,"Using a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction technique, we have mapped the repair of ultraviolet light-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) at the nucleotide level in exons 1, 2, and 5 of the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We found that CPDs are preferentially repaired in the transcribed strand (T strand) and that the order of repair efficiency is exon 1 > exon 2 > exon 5. In the cells with a deletion of the DHFR gene encompassing the promoter region and the first four exons, CPDs are not repaired in the T strand of the residual DHFR gene. These results substantiate the idea that the preferential repair of CPDs in the T strand is transcription dependent. However, in the wild type gene we have found that CPDs are efficiently repaired in the nontranscribed strand (NT strand) of exon 1 but not in the NT strand of exons 2 and 5. Probing the chromatin structure of exons 1, 2, and 5 of theDHFR gene with micrococcal nuclease revealed that the exon 1 region is much more sensitive to micrococcal nuclease digestion than the exon 2 and exon 5 regions, suggesting that the chromatin structure in the exon 1 region is much more open. These results suggest that, although preferential repair of the T strand of the DHFRgene is transcription dependent, repair of the NT strand is greatly affected by chromatin structure.

Although the recognition and excision of these different kinds of bulky DNA damage may not be identical, in general they follow two distinct subpathways in mammalian cells: 1) transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which can selectively and efficiently repair transcription-blocking DNA damage in the transcribed strand (T strand) of transcriptionally active genes; and 2) global genomic repair (GGR), which is responsible for repairing DNA damage in the noncoding regions,i.e. the nontranscribed strand (NT strand) of transcriptionally active genes and both strands of transcriptionally inactive genes (3Balajee A.S.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), however, suggest that NER in mammalian cells is much more complex than the current understanding of TCR and GGR would indicate. For example, using a T4 endo V incision method in combination with a ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LMPCR), we found that CPDs are efficiently repaired in both strands of the endogenous adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT ) gene in CHO cells and that this repair is independent of transcription (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast, CPD repair in a translocated APRT gene differs from CPD repair in the endogenous APRT gene (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12777-12783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In one case CPDs are preferentially repaired in the T strand, and in another case CPDs in both the T and NT strands are not efficiently repaired even though theAPRT gene in both cases is transcriptionally active (20Feng Z., Hu, W.

Using the same method, Pfeifer and co-workers (23Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) have found that, in the human JUN gene, CPDs in the NT strand between nucleotides −40 and +100 relative to the major transcription start site are repaired as efficiently as in the T strand and that the repair of CPDs along the T strand appears to be faster at the 5′-end and is gradually reduced toward the 3′-end. These discoveries were made possible by the T4 endo V incision method in combination with LMPCR to map CPD distributions at the sequence level (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Together, these results raise the possibility that CPD repair in transcriptionally active genes may be affected not only by the transcription process but also by genomic context and the “open” chromatin structure at the promoter region of active genes. Interestingly, the results of experiments measuring CPD repair along the T strand of the DHFR gene have been controversial; both uniform repair and a 5′ to 3′ gradient of repair have been reported (15Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S., Ho, L. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16666-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 350: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine whether there is a 5′ to 3′ polarity in CPD repair of the DHFR gene and further test the possibility that factors other than those involved in TCR and GGR affect CPDs repair, we have mapped CPD repair at the sequence level inDHFR genes with or without a promoter region using T4 endo V incision combined with LMPCR. We have found that CPD repair at the 5′-end of the T strand is indeed faster than at the 3′-end, which is consistent with a gradient repair along the T strand, and that CPD repair in the T strand is dependent on the presence of a promoter and active transcription. Although CPDs are not repaired in the NT strand of exons 2 and 5, they are efficiently repaired in the NT strand of exon 1. Probing the chromatin structure with micrococcal nuclease (MN) revealed that digestion is significantly faster in exon 1 than in exons 2 and 5, indicating that the chromatin structure in the exon 1 area of the DHFR gene is much more open compared with those in exon 2 and 5. These results suggest that, although preferential repair of the T strand of the DHFR gene is transcription dependent, repair of the NT strand is greatly affected by chromatin structure. CHO-AT3-2 cells are DHFR+ and contain diploid DHFR loci; both loci are transcriptionally active. CHO-DG22 cells are DHFR−mutants; they are hemizygous for the DHFR gene locus, which has a deletion encompassing the whole promoter region and the first four exons (24Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Chasin L.A. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). CHO-AT3-2 cells were grown in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and CHO-DG22 cells were grown in F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For UV irradiation, cells were grown to 50–70% confluence in 150-mm dishes and UV-irradiated at a fluence rate of 1 J/m2/s for 15 s using GE15118 germicidal lamps (predominate emission, 254 nm) as the UV source. After irradiation, the cells were incubated in fresh medium containing 10 μm 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine and 1 μm 5-fluorodeoxyuridine for various periods of time to allow DNA repair for repair kinetic analysis. After incubation, the cells were lysed, and DNA was isolated and purified as described previously (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Unreplicated DNA was separated from replicated DNA by cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation and used for repair analysis (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). A known quantity of purified genomic DNA was treated with T4 endo V followed by photoreactivation and then subjected to LMPCR as described previously (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol.

Oligonucleotide primer sets, which are specific for Chinese hamster DHFRgene sequences, were used to map CPDs in exons 1, 2, and 5 of theDHFR gene (see Table I). Oligonucleotide primers 1-1, 1-4, 2-1, 2-4, 5-1, and 5-4 were the sequence primers used in the first primer extension step of LMPCR; primers 1-2, 1-5, 2-2, 2-5, 5-2, and 5-5 were the PCR primers; and primers 1-3, 1-6, 2-3, 2-6, 5-3, and 5-6 were used to make the hybridization probes. A specific amount of 32P-labeled linearized pBR322 plasmid DNA (∼20,000 dpm) was added to each sample at the beginning of the reaction as an internal standard (20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12777-12783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After LMPCR, equivalent counts of 32P representing equivalent amounts of template DNA for each time point of the reaction were loaded into each lane of the sequencing gel. After separation by electrophoresis in 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, the PCR products were electrotransferred to nylon membranes and hybridized with32P-labeled probes. The membranes were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen and then scanned with the Cyclone (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The intensity was determined in all CPD-specific bands of the sequencing gel that showed a consistent and measurable signal above background. Background values (from T4 endo V-treated, nonirradiated control lanes) were subtracted. The intensity at each position was measured from at least three independent experiments, the average value was calculated, and the CPD repair kinetics were established for both T and NT strands in exons 1, 2, and 5 of theDHFR gene.Table ISynthetic oligomer primers for LMPCR analysis of DHFR exons 1, 2 and 5PrimerSequenceT m1-aTemperatures are degrees Celsius.For the T strand, exon 11-bGenBank™ accession number M13129.1–1CCGGGCGAATGCAATTT54.21–2CTTGGGGGAAGCACAGCGTACAG61.61–3CAGCGTACAGGCTGCCTAGGTGAT60.5For the NT strand, exon 11-bGenBank™ accession number M13129.1–4CGTCTCCGCCAAGTGCT51.71–5CGCCAAGTGCTCGACCCGATTC64.51–6TTCAGCGAACCGCCTCGGTTTC64.0For the T strand, exon 21-bGenBank™ accession number M13129.2–1CGGACTTGCATGGGTAGC51.22–2GGTAGCCGCTGAGATGGAGCCTGAG65.02–3GGGTCCCTGTTAACACAGTGTTTCTCT62.6For the NT strand, exon 21-bGenBank™ accession number M13129.2–4GAAGCAAAGTTCCCAGATTC48.12–5GGGAGACTTCGCACTTCCACGTCTG63.92–6CGTCTGCATTGGAAATCTTGCTTCATAC61.9For the T strand, exon 51-cGenBank™ accession numberM13477.5–1TAAAGGAAGCCATGAATCAG47.15–2CATGAATCAGCCAGGCCATCTCAGAC63.75–3CCATCTCAGACTCTTTGTGACAAGGATCA61.8For the NT strand, exon 51-cGenBank™ accession numberM13477.5–4TATTTCTCCAAATCAATTTCTG46.25–5TCCAAATCAATTTCTGGGAAGAACGTGTC64.05–6CGTGTCACTTTCAAATTCCTGCATGA61.01-a Temperatures are degrees Celsius.1-b GenBank™ accession number M13129.1-c GenBank™ accession numberM13477. Open table in a new tab Messenger RNA was isolated from CHO-AT3-2 cells using a Qiagen Oligotex Direct mRNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Extracted mRNA was quantified by UV spectrophotometry, and the quality was examined by electrophoresis in an 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. The method for strand-specific RT-PCR was the same as described by Nouspikel and Hanawalt (25Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, 1 μg of mRNA was reverse transcribed using a Superscript II kit (Invitrogen). To overcome the nonspecific amplification caused by the secondary structures in the mRNA, which, in turn, would serve as self-primers, reverse transcription was first performed for 20 min at 42 °C in the absence of primer but with 0.6 μl of the dideoxyadenosine triphosphate/deoxynucleoside triphosphate (ddATP/dNTP) mixture from a sequencing kit (Promega) at a volume of 18 μl (25Nouspikel T. Hanawalt P.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1562-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Subsequently, dNTP and 50 pmol of strand specific primers for the T or NT strand of the DHFR gene exon 1 were added, and the reaction was continued at 42 °C for an additional 40 min. The sequences of the RT primers specific for the T or NT strand were 5′-CTGAGCATTGGCCAGGGAAGGTC-3′ (for the T strand) and 5′-GCTGTCATGGTTCGACCGCTGAA-3′ (for the NT strand). RNA was removed by adding 20 μg/ml RNase A and incubating for 1 h at 37 °C. The purified complementary DNA was then used for amplification with the previously mentioned primers specific for the DHFR gene exon 1. Methods for nuclei isolation and subsequent MN digestion were the same as described by Kuhnert et al. (26Kuhnert P. Peterhans E. Pauli U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1943-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5×107) were harvested from culture flasks by trypsinization and resuspended in 10 ml of hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2) for 30 min in ice. After centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 2 min, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of hypotonic buffer and homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer (15 ml, loose pestle, 40 strokes) in the presence of 0.3% IGEPAL CA-630 (Sigma). Nuclei were purified by centrifugation at 1,500 ×g for 10 min in hypotonic buffer containing 8.5% sucrose (w/v) and resuspended in digestion buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2). 10 million nuclei were digested with MN (USB) (1 unit) in 100 μl for 1, 2, 5, and 10 min at 37 °C. Control was an undigested, immediately lysed sample. The digestion was stopped by adding an equal volume of stop solution (200 mmTris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 200 μg/ml proteinase K) and incubating for 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was purified and separated by electrophoresis in an 1.5% agarose gel. After staining with ethidium bromide, the separated DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane and hybridized with 32P-labeled probes specific for DHFR exons 1, 2, or 5 (20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E.

It has been well established that CPDs are preferentially repaired in the T strand of the DHFR gene in CHO cells (8Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

Res. 1992; 274: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Controversial results, however, have been reported in regard to the repair pattern of CPDs along the T strand of the DHFR gene. Using a Southern blot-based DNA repair assay, both uniform repair and a 5′ to 3′ polarity effect on CPD repair along the T strand of the DHFRgene have been reported (15Bohr V.A. Okumoto D.S., Ho, L. Hanawalt P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 16666-16672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Mutat. Res. 1996; 350: 207-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). To determine the repair pattern of CPDs along the T strand of the DHFR gene, we mapped CPD distribution in exons 1, 2, and 5 of the DHFR gene in UV-irradiated CHO-AT3-2 cells with different post-irradiation incubation times by using the T4 endo V incision method in combination with LMPCR. Results in Fig. 1 and Fig.2 show that CPDs are efficiently repaired in the T strand of exons 1, 2, and 5, being almost completely repaired after 24 h. However, the initial rate of CPD repair is faster in exon 1 than in exon 2, and it is much faster in exons 1 and 2 than in exon 5. After 4 h of incubation, the percentage of CPDs repaired in exons 1, 2, and 5 of the T strand were 45, 20 and 10%, respectively; after 8 h of incubation, the percentage of CPDs repaired in exons 1, 2, and 5 of the T strand were 80, 75 and 40%, respectively. The times required for 50% of the CPD removal (T 12) in exons 1, 2, and 5 are 5, 6, and 12 h, respectively.Figure 2The kinetics of CPDs repair in exons 1, 2, and 5 of the DHFR gene in CHO-AT3-2 cells. The relative amount of CPDs at the dipyrimidine sites (bracketed) along the T (panel A) and NT (panel B) strands of exons 1, 2, and 5 of theDHFR gene for each time point shown in Fig. 1 was quantified with a Cyclone phosphorimaging device. The percentage of CPDs remaining in each strand of each exon was plotted as a function of repair time. The results represent three to four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although CPDs are poorly repaired in the NT strand of exons 2 and 5, CPDs are efficiently repaired in the NT strand of exon 1; CPDs in the NT strand of exon 1 are repaired at a rate similar to that of the T strand, being almost completely repaired within 24 h (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). The efficient CPD repair in the NT of exon 1 raises the possibility that this strand may be part of the transcription unit for the gene located immediately 5′ upstream of theDHFR gene (27Mitchell P.J. Carothers A.M. Han J.H. Harding J.D. Kas E. Venolia L. Chaisn L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate this possibility, we have tested for the presence of a transcript representing the NT strand sequence of the DHFR exon 1 by strand-specific RT-PCR. Results in Fig. 3 show that no such transcript was detected. The efficient CPD repair observed in the T strand of exons 2 and 5 but not in the NT strand of these two exons is in agreement with previous experiments using a Southern blot-based method that quantifies CPDs in a defined DNA fragment (8Mellon I.

Res. 1992; 274: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To further test whether this preferential repair in the T strand is transcription-dependent, we have mapped the repair of CPDs in the exon 5 of CHO-DG22 cells. These cells have a deletion encompassing the entire promoter region and the first four exons of theDHFR gene, and they contain no detectable transcripts corresponding to the remaining exons 5 and 6 (24Urlaub G. Mitchell P.J. Kas E. Chasin L.A. Funanage V.L. Myoda T.T. Hamlin J.L. Somatic Cell Mol. Genet. 1986; 12: 555-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The results in Fig.4 show that CPDs are poorly repaired in both the T and the NT strands of exon 5 in CHO-DG22 cells, with more than 90% of CPDs remaining unrepaired in both strands after 24 h of incubation. These results support the idea that preferential CPD repair in the T strand of the transcriptionally active DHFRgene observed in CHO-AT3-2 cells is transcription dependent. The packaging of eukaryotic DNA into chromatin affects many dynamic processes, including DNA repair (28Morales V. Giamarchi C. Chailleux C. Moro F. Marsaud V., Le Ricousse S. Richard-Foy H. Biochimie (Paris). 2001; 83: 1029-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Using mononucleosome or dinucleosome systems, several laboratories have demonstrated that nucleosomal structure can inhibit the repair of CPDs (29Liu X. Smerdon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23729-23735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and other UV light-induced photoproducts (30Hara R., Mo, J. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 9173-9181Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 31Ura K. Araki M. Saeki H. Masutani C. Ito T. Iwai S. Mizukoshi T. Kaneda Y. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2004-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) in in vitro NER assays. These results suggest that the assembly of nucleosomes may restrict the access of DNA repair proteins to the damaged bases. It is well established that the kinetics of MN digestion are faster for active genes than for inactive genes and bulk genomic DNA, which indicates that the chromatin structure of actively transcribed genes is relatively “loose” and more accessible to the transcription machinery (32Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1414) Google Scholar). These results raise the possibility that nucleosome structure and/or nucleosome density in the region around exon 1 of the DHFR gene may be much more open than the chromatin structure in the regions of exons 2 and 5. Consequently, exon 1 is more accessible to the DNA repair machinery, and thus CPDs are efficiently repaired in both strands. To test this possibility, we have probed the chromatin structure of exons 1, 2, and 5 for their sensitivity to MN digestion. Nuclei isolated from CHO-AT3-2 cells were subjected to digestion with MN for different time periods. The DNA was then purified, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and hybridized with specific probes for exons 1, 2, or 5, respectively. The results in Fig. 5 show that the chromatin structure in the exon 1 region is much more sensitive to MN digestion than the chromatin in exons 2 and 5 or bulk genomic DNA. Although the distribution of the digested DNA of exons 1, 2, and 5 shows no difference from bulk genomic DNA after 1 min of MN treatment, with longer MN digestion periods the difference in the distribution of digested DNA becomes significant. After 2 min of MN treatment, most of exon 1 is in di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentanucleosome structures with a significant portion in mononucleosome structures. In contrast, most of exons 2 and 5 are in tetranucleosomes and higher nucleosome structures. After 5 min of MN treatment there are more di- and mononucleosomes in the exon 1 region than there are in the exon 2 or 5 regions, with less higher nucleosome structures in the exon 1 region than those in exons 2 and 5. After 10 min of MN treatment, exon 1 is only in mono- and dinucleosomes, whereas significant amounts of exons 2 and 5 are still in nucleosome structures higher than dinucleosomes. The results in Fig. 5 also demonstrate that bulk genomic DNA is more resistant to MN digestion than the DNA in DHFRexons 1, 2, and 5. We conclude that the chromatin structure in the region of exon 1 is more open than that in the regions of exons 2 and 5, which indicates that the exon 1 region of DHFR is more accessible to the DNA repair machinery and could be the reason for the efficient repair of CPDs in both the NT and T strands. We have mapped the repair pattern of CPDs at the nucleotide level in both strands of exons 1, 2, and 5 of the DHFR gene in CHO cells and have found two distinct repair features. First, preferential repair of CPDs along the T strand of the DHFR gene showed a gradient of repair efficiency with faster repair at the 5′-end and slower repair at the 3′-end. Second, the repair of CPDs along the NT strand was very efficient in the area of exon 1 but poor in exons 2 and 5. Because we were unable to detect any transcript coded by the NT strand of exon 1 of the DHFR gene, the efficient repair of CPDs in the NT strand of exon 1 is unlikely to be due to the overlapping transcription in the opposite direction of theDHFR gene. However, the efficient repair of CPDs in the T strand is most likely to be transcription dependent, because CPDs were only repaired poorly in the DHFR gene in cells with a deletion of the promoter and the first four exons of theDHFR gene. These results suggest that the efficient CPD repair in the T strand of the DHFR gene is through a TCR mechanism. The findings that CPDs are efficiently repaired in the NT strand of exon 1 but not in exons 2 and 5 suggest that factors other than transcription per se may affect repair efficiency. Ample evidence has demonstrated that there are two major pathways for CPD repair in mammalian cells, namely TCR and GGR, with the former pathway repairing CPDs in the T strand and the latter pathway repairing CPDs in the NT strand of active genes and noncoding bulk genomic DNA (2Friedberg E.C.

However, several lines of evidence indicate that the repair of CPDs in mammalian cells may be much more complicated than our current understanding would indicate. For example, we have recently found that CPDs in both strands of the endogenous APRT gene of CHO cells are efficiently repaired and that this repair is transcription independent (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12777-12783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that when the APRT gene is integrated at chromosomal positions different from the endogenous position, features of the repair of CPDs are different from those of the endogenous APRT gene even though the transcriptional activity of the integrated gene is the same as that of the endogenous gene. In one case, CPDs are repaired only in the T strand, and in two other cases CPDs are not repaired in either the T or NT strands (20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12777-12783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). These results, together with our current findings that CPDs are efficiently repaired in the NT strand of exon 1 of the DHFRgene in CHO cells and that repair of CPDs shows a 5′ to 3′ gradient effect, suggest that CPD repair in mammalian cells is more complicated than via the described TCR and GGR pathways. We have found that CPDs in the T strand are repaired more efficiently at the 5′-end of the DHFR gene than at the 3′-end of the gene. CPD repair in the T strand of the FMS, JUN, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) genes in humans is also more efficient at the 5′-end than at the 3′-end of the gene (23Tu Y. Tornaletti S. Pfeifer G.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Islas A.L. Hanawalt P.C. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 336-341PubMed Google Scholar, 36George J.W.

Biol. 2001; 21: 7355-7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). To further understand the mechanism of this transcription polarity-related repair efficiency in the T strand of theDHFR gene, we probed the chromatin structure at exons 1, 2, and 5 of this gene using MN digestion. The sensitivity to MN digestion reflects chromatin structure, with tight chromatin being more resistant. Our results show that chromatin structure in the exon 1 area is more open than in the exon 2 and 5 areas of the gene. Because transcription opens up chromatin structure, it is possible that the more open chromatin structure observed at the 5′-end as compared with the 3′-end may reflect that, at any given moment, more transcription is taking place at the 5′-end of the gene than at the 3′-end. Indeed, it has been found that the 5′-end of the DHFR gene is transcribed more frequently than the 3′-end, with many of the transcripts being incomplete (27Mitchell P.J. Carothers A.M. Han J.H. Harding J.D. Kas E. Venolia L. Chaisn L.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 425-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This suggests that more TCR will occur at the 5′-end of the gene than at the 3′-end of the gene as has been recently suggested by George et al. (36George J.W. Salazar E.P. Vreeswijk M.P. Lamerdin J.E. Reardon J.T. Zdzienicka M.Z. Sancar A. Kadkhodayan S. Tebbs R.S. Mullenders L.H. Thompson L.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 7355-7365Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It may be that additional transcription factors are present not only at the promoter but also throughout the 5′-end of the gene, rendering this region more accessible to the repair machinery than the 3′-end of the gene. The more open chromatin structure observed at exon 1 ofDHFR and, consequently, the increased accessibility to NER machinery could explain the efficient repair of the NT strand in the exon 1 region. Efficient repair of CPDs in the NT strand has also been observed in the APRT and JUN genes (18Zheng Y. Pao A. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16786-16796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 20Feng Z., Hu, W. Komissarova E. Pao A. Hung M. Adair G.M. Tang M.-s. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). At the present time we are unable to demonstrate different sensitivities toward MN digestion between exon 2 and exon 5. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that differences in chromatin structure between these two exon regions, which are too subtle to be detected by MN digestion kinetics, may cause different affinities toward the NER machinery, which may contribute to a polarity-related repair efficiency in the T strand of the DHFR gene. Based on these results, we propose that the repair efficiency of a region of genomic DNA might be determined by chromatin structure. Most or at least a significant number of active genes may typically have very different chromatin structures than inactive genes or noncoding regions, and these structures may be much more accessible to and/or have a greater affinity for DNA repair proteins. Transcription-induced chromatin changes may enhance accessibility of the active genes to DNA repair or promote TCR in the T strand. If the chromatin structure of an active gene or a region is not already optimal for repair processes, then chromatin remodeling or transcription-induced chromatin changes may enhance the accessibility of this region to repair and promote transcription-coupled repair in the T strand. If the local chromatin structure surrounding a gene has already rendered the region maximally accessible to repair proteins (as may be the case for the exon 1 of the DHFR gene), then transcription would not be necessary to facilitate repair, and both strands might be repaired with equal efficiency.

Acetylation of Ser-530 of PGHS-1 by aspirin abolishes all oxygenase activity and transforms the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical from a functional 33–35-gauss (G) wide doublet/wide singlet to a 26-G narrow singlet unable to oxidize AA. In contrast, aspirin-treated PGHS-2 (ASA-PGHS-2) no longer forms prostaglandins but retains oxygenase activity forming 11(R)- and 15(R)-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid and also retains the EPR line-shape of the native peroxide-induced 29–30-G wide singlet radical. To evaluate the functional role of the wide singlet radical in ASA-PGHS-2, we have examined the ability of this radical to oxidize AA in single-turnover EPR studies. Anaerobic addition of AA to ASA-PGHS-2 immediately after formation of the wide singlet radical generated either a 7-line EPR signal similar to the pentadienyl AA radical obtained in native PGHS-2 or a 26–28-G singlet radical. These EPR signals could be accounted for by a pentadienyl radical and a strained allyl radical, respectively. Experiments using 11d-AA, 13(R)d-AA, 15d-AA, 13,15d 2-AA, and octadeuterated AA (d 8-AA) confirmed that the unpaired electron in the pentadienyl radical is delocalized over C11, C13, and C15. A 6-line EPR radical was observed when 16d 2-AA was used, indicating only one strongly interacting C16 hydrogen. These results support a functional role for peroxide-generated tyrosyl radicals in lipoxygenase catalysis by ASA-PGHS-2 and also indicate that the AA radical in ASA-PGHS-2 is more constrained than the corresponding radical in native PGHS-2.

Understanding the mechanism of the lipoxygenase activity in ASA-PGHS-2 may, thus, provide insights into the pharmacology of the differential effect of aspirin on the two PGHS isozymes.Substantial evidence supports the branched-chain radical mechanism for PGHS catalysis originally proposed by Ruf and co-workers (14Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, a specific protein-linked tyrosyl radical produced in the peroxidase cycle serves a catalytic role in cyclooxygenase activity. EPR observations in single turnover experiments provide convincing evidence that the peroxide-generated tyrosyl radicals in PGHS-1 and -2 can oxidize AA, the cyclooxygenase substrate, thus generating a pentadienyl AA radical characterized by a 7-line EPR spectrum (16Tsai A.-L.

The tyrosyl radical mechanism explains the observed heme dependence of both enzyme activities and the requirement of the cyclooxygenase for a hydroperoxide activator (3Smith W.L. Eling T.E.

In contrast, the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in ASA-PGHS-2 retains the EPR characteristics of the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in native PGHS-2, a 29–30-G wide singlet (25Xiao G. Tsai A.-L.

In the present study, we have examined whether the wide singlet tyrosyl radical of ASA-PGHS-2 is capable of AA oxidation to support the 11- and 15-lipoxygenase activity. The results indicate that the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in ASA-PGHS-2 does indeed react with AA to generate fatty acid radical intermediates. Interestingly, the AA radical species in ASA-PGHS-2 appears capable of adopting either a pentadienyl structure (as found with native PGHS-2) or a more constrained conformation (similar to that observed with native PGHS-1).MATERIALS AND METHODSAA was purchased from NuChek Preps, Inc., Elysian, MN. 5,6,8,9,11,12,14,15-Octadeuterated arachidonic acid (d 8-AA) was obtained as a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche or purchased from Cayman Chemical Co.

The batches of PGHS-1 used in this study had specific activities of 100–120 μmol of O2/min/mg; the PGHS-2 batches had specific activities of 20–42 μmol O2/min/mg.ASA-PGHS-2 was prepared as described previously (25Xiao G.

Briefly, the PGHS-2 holoenzyme was treated with aspirin, and the residual oxygenase activity was monitored periodically as the incubation proceeded at room temperature. When the oxygenase activity dropped to half the original value (reflecting the decreased oxygen consumption stoichiometry upon transition from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase catalysis), the reaction mixture was passed over a desalting column (10DG, Bio-Rad) to remove salicylate and unreacted aspirin. The use of a standardized oxygenase activity criterion for ending aspirin treatment was prompted by the observation of considerable variation in residual oxygenase activity after extended aspirin treatment among individual batches of PGHS-2 (data not shown). When necessary, the ASA-PGHS-2 was concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM30 membrane (Amicon) before the addition of 15–20% glycerol and storage at −70 °C.Single turnover experiments using an anaerobic titrator were performed as previously described (16Tsai A.-L.

Oxygenase activity is completely abolished in aspirin-treated PGHS-1 (ASA-PGHS-1), whereas aspirin-treated PGHS-2 (ASA-PGHS-2) still catalyzes formation of 15(R)- and 11(R)-HPETE (9Holtzman M.J.

Understanding the mechanism of the lipoxygenase activity in ASA-PGHS-2 may, thus, provide insights into the pharmacology of the differential effect of aspirin on the two PGHS isozymes. Substantial evidence supports the branched-chain radical mechanism for PGHS catalysis originally proposed by Ruf and co-workers (14Karthein R. Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Dietz R. Nastainczyk W. Ruf H.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In this mechanism, a specific protein-linked tyrosyl radical produced in the peroxidase cycle serves a catalytic role in cyclooxygenase activity. EPR observations in single turnover experiments provide convincing evidence that the peroxide-generated tyrosyl radicals in PGHS-1 and -2 can oxidize AA, the cyclooxygenase substrate, thus generating a pentadienyl AA radical characterized by a 7-line EPR spectrum (16Tsai A.-L.

The tyrosyl radical mechanism explains the observed heme dependence of both enzyme activities and the requirement of the cyclooxygenase for a hydroperoxide activator (3Smith W.L. Eling T.E.

The mechanism also is consistent with crystallographic data that show a tyrosine residue (Tyr-385 in PGHS-1 and Tyr-371 in PGHS-2) positioned between the heme and the AA binding site (20Picot D.

In PGHS-1, aspirin treatment causes a change of the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical EPR spectrum from a 34–35-G doublet to a 25–26-G narrow singlet; this narrow singlet tyrosyl radical is unable to oxidize AA (16Tsai A.-L.

Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 833-837PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in ASA-PGHS-2 retains the EPR characteristics of the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in native PGHS-2, a 29–30-G wide singlet (25Xiao G. Tsai A.-L. Palmer G. Boyar W.C. Marshall P.J. Kulmacz R.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1836-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined whether the wide singlet tyrosyl radical of ASA-PGHS-2 is capable of AA oxidation to support the 11- and 15-lipoxygenase activity. The results indicate that the peroxide-induced tyrosyl radical in ASA-PGHS-2 does indeed react with AA to generate fatty acid radical intermediates. Interestingly, the AA radical species in ASA-PGHS-2 appears capable of adopting either a pentadienyl structure (as found with native PGHS-2) or a more constrained conformation (similar to that observed with native PGHS-1).

Briefly, the PGHS-2 holoenzyme was treated with aspirin, and the residual oxygenase activity was monitored periodically as the incubation proceeded at room temperature. When the oxygenase activity dropped to half the original value (reflecting the decreased oxygen consumption stoichiometry upon transition from cyclooxygenase to lipoxygenase catalysis), the reaction mixture was passed over a desalting column (10DG, Bio-Rad) to remove salicylate and unreacted aspirin. The use of a standardized oxygenase activity criterion for ending aspirin treatment was prompted by the observation of considerable variation in residual oxygenase activity after extended aspirin treatment among individual batches of PGHS-2 (data not shown). When necessary, the ASA-PGHS-2 was concentrated by ultrafiltration on a YM30 membrane (Amicon) before the addition of 15–20% glycerol and storage at −70 °C.Single turnover experiments using an anaerobic titrator were performed as previously described (16Tsai A.-L.

Upon ligation by CD80 (B7–1) or CD86 (B7–2), CD28 induces T cell proliferation, cytokine production, and effector functions, whereas CTLA-4 signaling inhibits expansion of activated T cells and induces tolerance. Therefore, we hypothesized that co-stimulatory molecules that preferentially bind CD28 or CTLA-4 would have dramatically altered biological properties. We describe directed molecular evolution of CD80 genes derived from human, orangutan, rhesus monkey, baboon, cat, cow, and rabbit by DNA shuffling and screening. In contrast to wild-type CD80, the evolved co-stimulatory molecules, termed CD28-binding protein (CD28BP) and CTLA-4-binding protein (CTLA-4BP), selectively bind to CD28 or CTLA-4, respectively. Furthermore, CD28BP has improved capacity to induce human T cell proliferation and interferon-γ production compared with wild-type CD80. In contrast, CTLA-4BP inhibited human mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR) and enhanced interleukin 10 production in MLR, supporting a role for CTLA-4BP in inducing T cell anergy and tolerance. In addition, co-stimulation of purified human T cells was significantly suppressed when CTLA-4BP was cotransfected with either CD80 or CD28BP. The amino acid sequences of CD28BP and CTLA-4BP were 61 and 96% identical with that of human CD80 and provide insight into the residues that are critical in the ligand binding. These molecules provide a new approach to characterization of CD28 and CTLA-4 signals and to manipulation of the T cell response.

The specificity of the response is determined by recognition of an antigenic peptide in the context of major histocompatibility complex on the plasma membrane of antigen-presenting cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, or primed B cells. However, a second signal, mediated by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells, is required for induction of a complete T cell response (1Frauwirth K. Thompson C. J. Clin.

We hypothesized that directed molecular evolution of diverse mammalian CD80 genes by DNA shuffling combined with the appropriate screening procedures would enable the generation of chimeric molecules that preferentially bind and signal through either CD28 or CTLA-4.cDNAs encoding human, orangutan, rhesus monkey, baboon, cat, cow and rabbit CD80 genes were subjected to DNA shuffling, and libraries of shuffled genes were generated. After two rounds of DNA shuffling and screening, chimeric genes with dramatically altered ligand binding and functional properties were identified. These new molecules, termed CD28-binding protein (CD28BP)1 and CTLA-4-binding protein (CTLA-4BP), help in further dissecting the mechanisms by which CD28 and CTLA-4 trigger their biological effects, and they provide a new approach to manipulation of the T cell response.DISCUSSIONWe describe the generation of novel co-stimulatory molecules, CD28BP and CTLA-4BP, that selective bind to and signal through CD28 or CTLA-4. These unique ligand binding profiles resulted in functional properties that are dramatically different from those of hCD80. CD28BP has improved the capacity to activate human T cells as compared with hCD80, whereas CTLA-4BP induces no co-stimulation of human T cells and inhibits T cell response in MLR.B7 co-stimulatory molecules have improved the efficacy of gene- and cell-based vaccines in animal models (37Townsend S.

Thomas J. Zollner R. O'Toole M. Swiniarski H. Dorner A. Wolf S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4964-4972PubMed Google Scholar). Our data indicate increased binding of sCD28-Ig to transfectants expressing CD28BP as compared with those expressing hCD80, and the improved ligand binding was also associated with enhanced co-stimulation of human T cells. The increased binding of sCD28-Ig cannot be explained by higher expression levels of CD28BP because FLAG-tagged constructs demonstrated equal expression levels and because binding to sCTLA-4-Ig was simultaneously decreased. The maximum level of T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production induced by CD28BP transfectants also increased as compared with those observed in the presence of hCD80 transfectants. Again, the improved T cell proliferation could not be attributed to improved expression levels of CD28BP because FLAG-tagged constructs analyzed using anti-FLAG mAbs demonstrated comparable expression levels on these transient transfectants. Although the FLAG epitope was found to interfere with the function of both CD28BP and hCD80, CD28BP induced at least 3-fold higher T cell proliferative response than hCD80 also when analyzed using transfectants expressing these FLAG-tagged constructs. Furthermore, although expression levels of stable transfectants are more difficult to normalize when two different molecules are studied, the more potent T cell co-stimulation induced by CD28BP than hCD80 stable transfectants further supports the notion that CD28BP has an enhanced capacity to co-stimulate human T cells. These data are also in line with the conclusion that the improved T cell co-stimulation in response to CD28BP is a result of the altered ligand binding profile, as expected based on the known functional properties of CD28 and CTLA-4. However, additional studies are required to further determine the relative contribution of the increased affinity to CD28 and reduced affinity to CTLA-4 to the CD28BP-mediated improved T cell response.CTLA-4BP exhibited functional properties not shared by hCD80 in that CTLA-4BP inhibited MLR and IFN-γ production, whereas it enhanced IL-10 secretion. CTLA-4BP also inhibited T cell co-stimulation induced by hCD80 or CD28BP. The inhibitory effects of CTLA-4BP were not due to interference in expression levels, because a significant reduction in the level of T cell proliferation was observed, whereas cotransfection of CTLA-4BP had no suppressive effect on the expression levels when analyzed by flow cytometry. These data imply that CTLA-4BP inhibits T cell function through signaling via CTLA-4 and suggest that the effects of CTLA-4BP are mediated at the immunological synapse where the interactions between CD80 and CD28/CTLA-4 have previously been shown to take place (42Egen J.K.

Both IL-10 and IL-10 homologue encoded by Epstein-Barr virus inhibit antigen presentation, cytokine production, and accessory cell function of monocytes and dendritic cells (44de Waal Malefyt R.

Nevertheless, the present results are consistent with data demonstrating inhibition of T cell response in mice by a mouse CD80 mutant selectively binding to CTLA-4 (55Prud'homme G.J. Chang Y. Li X. Hum. Gene Ther. 2002; 13: 395-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, given the data supporting a role for CTLA-4 and IL-10 in inducing and maintaining immunological tolerance, our results suggest that CTLA-4BP may be beneficial in down-regulating the function of specific T cells in allergy and autoimmune diseases.The sequence information of the chimeric CD28BP and CTLA-4BP provides new insight into the residues that are involved in the ligand binding of B7 co-stimulatory molecules. Sequencing analysis revealed that all of the 14 different clones selected from the second round of evolution, which demonstrated preferential binding to CD28, contained a substitution of valine for isoleucine at amino acid position 49 of the mature sequence. Ile-49 does not appear to be directly involved in the interaction of CD80 with CTLA-4 (23Stamper C. Zhang Y. Tobin J. Erbe D. Ikemizu S. Davis S. Stahl M. Somers W. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but substitution I49A was previously shown to completely abolish binding of CD80 to both CD28 and CTLA-4, illustrating the importance of this residue in the ligand binding (20Peach R.

Although the I49V substitution is considered a relatively conservative replacement, our data suggest that substitutions derived from naturally existing genes via DNA shuffling (e.g. in this case I49V from the bovine CD80) provide improved means to screen for altered functional properties in proteins. Interestingly, bovine CD28 is the only exception among CD28 and CTLA-4 sequences analyzed from 12 different species in which the hexapeptide MYPPPY and Gly-66 are not fully conserved (i.e. MYPPPY is replaced by LYPPPY, and Gly 66 is replaced by valine) (22Metzler W.

Mutations in the MYPPPY sequence generally lead to reduced binding to both CD80 and CD86 (21Truneh A. Reddy M. Ryan P. Lyn S.D. Eichman C. Couez D. Hurle M.R. Sekaly R.P. Olive D. Sweet R. Mol.

Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and all of these residues with the exception of Pro-101 are in direct contact with CD80 (23Stamper C. Zhang Y. Tobin J. Erbe D. Ikemizu S. Davis S. Stahl M. Somers W. Mosyak L. Nature. 2001; 410: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the differences in the bovine CD28-B7 interactions and corresponding sequences contributed to the sequence diversity that also benefited the in vitro evolution of CD28BP described here.In 14 of the 19 selected clones with preferential binding to CTLA-4, Tyr-31 was replaced by histidine, whereas all 14 clones with preferential binding to CD28 retained the tyrosine at the corresponding position. Interestingly, Tyr-31 in human CD86 is substituted by phenylalanine without any apparent change in the ligand binding affinities (18Freeman G.J. Gribben J.G. Boussiotis V.A., Ng, J.W. Restivo V.A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), whereas the Y31A substitution completely abolishes the binding of hCD80 to both CD28 and CTLA-4 (20Peach R. Bajorath J. Naemura J. Leytze G. Greene J. Aruffo A. Linsley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21181-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The present data demonstrate that the Y31H substitution permits retention of the interaction with CTLA-4, at least when present in the context of the shuffled CTLA-4BP sequence, whereas this mutation appears to contribute to the loss of binding to CD28. On the other hand, the WPXYKNRT motif between the CDR2 loop and the D strand of CD80, which has also been implicated in the interaction with CD28 and CTLA-4 (56Fargeas C.A. Truneh A. Reddy M. Hurle M. Sweet R. Sekaly R.P. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is conserved across species, was retained in both CD28BP and CTLA-4BP, supporting the notion that this region contributes to binding of CD80 to both of its ligands. Nevertheless, more information of the three-dimensional structures of CD28BP and CTLA-4BP will be useful to further characterize the residues and structures that contribute to the preferential binding of these molecules to the two ligands.The present results also emphasize the complexity of protein structures and receptor-ligand interactions and illustrate the difficulty in predicting the residues within and outside ligand binding sites that most significantly affect the properties of the proteins. In contrast to the present results, mutations of hCD80 that were previously designed based on structural information and predicted receptor binding sites generally had equivalent effects on binding to CD28 and CTLA-4 (20Peach R. Bajorath J. Naemura J. Leytze G. Greene J. Aruffo A. Linsley P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21181-21187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The theoretical number of different protein sequences that can be generated by recombining the amino acids naturally present in any given position in the seven different mammalian CD80 molecules used in this study is 4 × 1074. This is far more than can be tested in any laboratory, but the current data show that the frequency of functional shuffled variants with altered ligand binding properties is high enough that the desired phenotype can be rapidly identified by selectively designed screening procedures. Thus, appropriate screening of the sequences provided by recombination of known mammalian genes is an effective means to identify chimeric sequences having novel functional properties without detailed knowledge of the receptor binding sites or structures of the proteins.In summary, the present study demonstrates the generation of novel chimeric co-stimulatory molecules that selectively bind to and signal through CD28 or CTLA-4. CD28BP and CTLA-4BP may help in further dissecting the mechanisms by which CD28 and CTLA-4 trigger positive and negative signals to T cells, respectively. The chimeric co-stimulatory molecules described here, CD28BP and CTLA-4BP, exhibit novel functional properties and provide a unique means to characterize and modulate CD28 and CTLA-4 signaling pathways in T cells. T cell response is dependent on complex integration of antigen-specific and nonspecific extracellular and intracellular signals. The specificity of the response is determined by recognition of an antigenic peptide in the context of major histocompatibility complex on the plasma membrane of antigen-presenting cells, such as monocytes, dendritic cells, Langerhans cells, or primed B cells. However, a second signal, mediated by co-stimulatory molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells, is required for induction of a complete T cell response (1Frauwirth K. Thompson C. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 2Carreno B. Collins M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 29-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 3Schwartz J.-C. Zhang X.

The most extensively studied co-stimulatory molecules are CD80 (B7–1) and CD86 (B7–2), which bind the CD28 and CTLA-4 (CD152) ligands expressed on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Additional co-stimulatory molecule-ligand pairs such as ICOS-B7-H and PD1-PDL have recently been identified, further illustrating the complexity of the signals that regulate the function of T cells (1Frauwirth K.

Expression cloning of a cDNA complementing the trf1 mutation led to the discovery of a novel casein Kinase 2 catalytic subunit (CK2α′′). To purify potential CK2α′′ phosphorylation-dependent sorting proteins from cytosol, the ASGPR cytoplasmic domain was expressed as a GST fusion protein and immobilized on glutathione-agarose. In the absence of phosphorylation, only trace amounts of cytosol protein were bound and eluted. When the fusion protein was phosphorylated, a heterocomplex of potential sorting proteins was recovered. Mass spectrometer and immunoblot analysis identified five of these proteins as gp96, HSP70, HSP90, cyclophilin-A, and FKBP18. Treatment of HuH-7 with rapamycin to disrupt the heterocomplex reduced surface ASGPR binding activity by 65 ± 5.7%. In Trf1 cells, surface-binding activity was 48 ± 7% of that in HuH-7 and was not further reduced by rapamycin treatment.

Recently, Trf1, an endocytic trafficking mutant, was isolated from the human hepatoblastoma cell line HuH-7 using a dual selection protocol (3Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Although anterograde steps of intracellular endocytic processing of ligand, including internalization, endosomal acidification, and degradation, were not significantly altered by thetrf1 mutation, a selective redistribution of ASGPR was observed. In Trf1 cells, the surface binding of the high affinity ASGPR ligand, asialo-oromucoid (ASOR), was reduced by 50% and that of transferrin by 30% compared with parental HuH-7 cells without affecting total receptor levels. In addition, the mutation expressed by Trf1 cells reduced the surface expression of several unrelated membrane proteins including connexin 43 (4). Expression cloning identified the gene that complemented the defect in Trf1 cells as a novel isoform of the α-subunit of CK2, designated CK2α′′ (5Shi X. Potvin B. Huang T. Hilgard P. Spray D.C.

CK2 is a highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed tetrameric enzyme that phosphorylates serine/threonine residues and is essential for the viability of eukaryotic cells (6Penner C.G. Wang Z. Litchfield D.W. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 525-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 7Ahmed K.G.D.A.C.C. Trends Cell Biol. 2002; 12: 226-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The tetrameric CK2 holoenzyme consists of two α-subunits, carrying the catalytic activity, and two β-subunits, which have stabilizing and regulatory functions required for maximal activity and regulation of substrate specificity (8Pinna L.A. Meggio F. Prog. Cell Cycle Res. 1997; 3: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The newly described CK2α′′ is 91% identical in the amino acid sequence, the last 32 being unique, and 65.2% identical in the nucleotide sequence to the previously described CK2α (9Meisner H. Heller-Harrison R. Buxton J. Czech M.P. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4072-4076Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Based on the results of 32P labeling, it was evident that ASGPR expressed by Trf1 cells was hypophosphorylated compared with ASGPR expressed by the parental HuH-7 cell line (3Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The identification of serine as the major phosphoamino acid in ASGPR (10Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the presence of a CK2 phosphorylation motif (SSEEND) in the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of ASGPR, are consistent with a potential role for CK2 in receptor trafficking. Indeed, of the endocytic receptors affected by thetrf1 mutation including the ASGPR, the transferrin receptor, and the mannose receptor, all possess a CK2 consensus motif in their CDs. In the present study, a heterocomplex of potential sorting proteins associated with the ASGPR-CD that depends on CK2 phosphorylation of its acidic cluster motif were isolated and identified as members of the heat shock and immunophilin (peptidyl-prolylcis/trans isomerase) families. Treatment of HuH-7 cells with the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin, known to prevent the association of immunophilin-HSP complexes (11Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), disrupted the heterocomplex, resulting in the transformation of the wild type to a mimic of the Trf1 phenotype. The HuH7 and Trf1 human hepatoma cell lines were described previously (3Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 4Stockert R.J. Spray D.C. Gao Y. Suadicani S.O. Ripley C.R. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Hertzberg E.L.

Plasticware was from BD Biosciences. The rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human ASGPR was previously described (12Treichel U. Paietta E. Poralla T. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Stockert R.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1994; 158: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The rat monoclonal antibody (mAb) to HSP90 was obtained fromCalbiochem. The mouse mAb to HSP70 was purchased from Neo Markers (Fremont, CA). The rabbit polyclonal antibody to FKBP59/HSP56 was obtained from Affinity BioReagents, Inc. (Golden, CO). Rapamycin and other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. The cDNA sequence encoding the cytoplasmic domain (MAKDFQDIQQLSSEENDHPFHQGPPPAQPLAQRLC) of the ASGPR H2b subunit was amplified by PCR from a previously described full-length clone (10Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and inserted into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGSTaq plasmid containing a thrombin cleavage site between GST and the CD (13Ron D. Dressler H. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 866-869PubMed Google Scholar). The pGSTaq ASGPR-CD construct was expressed in Escherichia coli, and the fusion protein was recovered from the bacteria lysate on a glutathione (GSH) affinity matrix as outlined by the manufacturer (Sigma). The GST-ASGPR-CD fusion protein bound to GSH-agarose beads was used as an affinity matrix to isolate potential sorting proteins from the cytosol. Phosphorylation of the GST-ASGPR-CD fusion protein with CK2 (Sigma) was performed while it was immobilized on the GSH-agarose beads. Beads (20 μl, containing 10–20 μg of fusion protein) were washed with CK2 reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 50 mmKCl, 10 mm MgCl2). Beads were resuspended in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 2 units/ml CK2 (human recombinant from E. coli, New England BioLabs Inc., Beverly, MA) and ATP (200 μm) for 2 h at 30 °C. The unincorporated phosphate and enzyme were removed by washing the beads three times with PBS (pH 7.4). Cytosol isolated from three 100-mm plates of confluent HuH-7 cells was passed through bound GST-ASGPR-CD with or without prior phosphorylation. Columns were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.4), and bound proteins were eluted with 1.0 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were concentrated by the addition of an equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid prior to centrifugation at 20,000 ×g for 10 min. The pellet was dissolved in 2× SDS sample buffer and the pH adjusted to an alkaline range with NH4OH for resolution on SDS-PAGE. The Coomassie Blue-stained bands were excised from SDS-polyacrylamide gels and completely destained with 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate in 50% acetonitrile. These gel pieces were treated with 10 mm dithiothreitol in 0.1m ammonium bicarbonate for protein reduction. Free cysteine residues were alkylated with freshly made 55 mmiodoacetamide in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Tryptic digestion was started with the addition of 25 ng μl−1sequence grade modified trypsin (Promega) in ammonium bicarbonate buffer. The protein was digested for at least 16 h at 30 °C with agitation. The digestion products were cleaned and concentrated using micro-C18 ZipTip (Millipore), mixed with 0.5 μl of 10 mg ml−1 α-cyano-4-hydroxysuccinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) TFA, and applied onto a MALDI plate. MALDI mass spectra were recorded with a PerSeptive Voyager-DE STR MALDI time-of-flight mass spectrometer operated in the reflectron mode. The mass measurement accuracy with internal calibration was, in general, better than 100 ppm. The measured peptide masses were used for data base searching with ProFound algorithm (ProteoMetrics, NY). Confluent cells in 60-mm dishes were washed with ASOR assay buffer (135 mm NaCl, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 27.8 mm glucose, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). After washing, the cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h. To measure 125I-ASOR binding, cells were chilled to 4 °C on ice for 10 min and incubated with 1 μg/ml 125I-ASOR in 1.5 ml of the assay buffer at 4 °C for 1 h in the absence (total binding) or presence (nonspecific binding) of 100 μg/ml unlabeled ASOR. Unbound ligand was removed by washes with assay buffer. Surface-bound 125I-ASOR was determined from the radioactivity released by incubating cells for 10 min at 4 °C in 1.5 ml of 20 mm EGTA in TBS, causing dissociation of the Ca+2-dependent ligand-receptor complex. Confluent cells were washed twice with prewarmed ASOR assay buffer and incubated with the same buffer for 1 h at 37 °C followed by storage on ice for 20 min. The prechilled cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0) prior to a 1-h incubation on ice with 2 ml of the membrane-impermeant label EZ-LinkTM Sulfo-NHS-Biotin (0.5 mg/ml, sulfosuccinimidobiotin obtained from Pierce) in PBS (pH 8.0). The reaction was stopped by adding glycine to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml for 2 min on ice. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 8.0), harvested by scraping, and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) with constant mixing at 4 °C for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis. UltraLinkTM immobilized protein G-agarose gel was washed three times with PBS prior to incubation with anti-ASGPR antibody for 1–2 h at 4 °C. Unbound antibody was removed by three 5-min washes with PBS. Anti-ASGPR was covalently cross-linked to the immobilized-protein G using dimethyl pimelimidate (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and harvested in either radioimmune precipitation buffer (for immunoprecipitation) or PBS containing 2% CHAPS detergent (for co-immunoprecipitation) with the addition of proteinase inhibitors (Sigma) and okadaic acid (1 ng/ml) (Calbiochem). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × gfor 10 min. Protein was quantified by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein from cell lysates were mixed with covalently bound antibody and incubated with constant mixing at 4 °C for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with the appropriate lysis buffer and once with PBS (pH 7.4). Bound proteins were released in 2× SDS loading buffer by heating to 90 °C for 10 min, resolved by 10 or 4–20% SDS-PAGE, and transferred in a semidry transfer cell (Bio-Rad) to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Cell lysates, post-nuclear supernatants, immunoprecipitated or affinity matrix-purified proteins, were resolved on 10 or 4–20% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight in TBST buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 10% nonfat dry milk. The membrane was incubated for 2 h at room temperature in one of the following antibodies: rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human ASGPR (diluted 1:5000); rat mAb to HSP90 (diluted to 0.2 μg/ml); mouse mAb to HSP70 (diluted to 0.2 μg/ml); or rabbit polyclonal antibody to FKBP59/HSP56 (diluted to 1 μg/ml) in TBST containing 2% dry milk. The membrane was washed 5 times with TBST and incubated at room temperature with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted to 1:500) in TBST containing 1% dry milk for 1 h. After being washed 5 times with TBST, the membrane was incubated for 1 min in chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) prior to film exposure. For sequentially probing with different antibodies, the primary antibodies were stripped with 0.1 m NaOH for 5 min at room temperature. Nonpermeabilized cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal antibody to the human ASGPR (diluted to 1:200). Following washes with PBS, the deposition of primary antibody was detected by incubation with 1:100 fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. Images were acquired on an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD digital camera. Digital images were assembled and labeled using Scion Image (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD) and Adobe PhotoShop (Adobe Systems Inc.). The endocytic trafficking mutant (Trf1) isolated from HuH7 cells is defective in cell surface ASGPR expression (3Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). This defect is the result of the failure of Trf1 to express a novel isoform of CK2 α (CK2 α′′) resulting in the hypophosphorylation of the ASGPR (5Shi X. Potvin B. Huang T. Hilgard P. Spray D.C. Suadicani S.O. Wolkoff A.W. Stanley P. Stockert R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2075-2082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Because it is reasonable to assume that ASGPR intracellular trafficking is directed by soluble sorting proteins that bind to the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the receptor, a GST fusion protein with the full-length CD of the ASGPR H2b subunit (10Paietta E. Stockert R.J. Racevskis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11078-11084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed to isolate the putative sorting complex. The GST-ASGPR-CD fusion protein was bound to GSH-agarose beads that were used as an affinity matrix to isolate potential sorting proteins from cytosol. Because the ASGPR-CD contains a CK2 phosphorylation site (SSEEN), it could be selectively labeled (Fig1). In the absence of added enzyme, no32P was incorporated into the fusion protein (data not shown). Cytosol was passed through the bead matrix with or without prior in vitro phosphorylation of the GST-ASGPR-CD by CK2. The affinity matrix was washed with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 1.0 m NaCl. Isolated proteins were concentrated and resolved on SDS-PAGE. As shown in figure 2, in the absence of phosphorylation only trace amounts of protein were bound and eluted from the GST-ASGPR-CD fusion protein affinity matrix. These proteins appeared to be nonspecific, as they were often recovered from GSH-agarose in the absence of GST fusion protein (data not shown). In contrast, when the GST fusion protein was phosphorylated, a heterocomplex of potential sorting proteins was recovered. Mass spectrometry analysis identified three of these proteins. Two were members of the heat shock family, gp96 and HSP70. Another protein, cyclophilin-A, which is commonly found in association with heat shock proteins and belongs to the immunophilin superfamily, was also identified. Based on these findings, a transblot of the heterocomplex was probed for members of the HSP and immunophilin families. The identification of the original HSP70 was confirmed, and two additional proteins, HSP90 and FKBP18 (Fig. 2), were identified in this fraction.Figure 2Isolation and identification of ASGPR cytoplasmic domain-associated proteins. Cytosol from HuH7 cells was passed through the GST-ASGPR-CD glutathione-agarose bead affinity matrix with (CD-P) or without phosphorylation by CK2. Columns were washed with PBS and bound proteins eluted with PBS adjusted to 1.0 m NaCl for resolution on 4–20% SDS-PAGE. Protein bands identified with Coomassie Blue staining (as shown) were excised and digested with trypsin for analysis by mass spectrometer. Proteins were confirmed (*) or identified (**) by Western blot analysis (see insert) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” MW, prestained molecular weight standards.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because it has been shown that the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin by virtue of its binding to FKBPs may dissociate HSP-immunophilin heterocomplexes (14Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), HuH7 and Trf1 cells were treated with rapamycin, and cell surface expression of ASGPR, as measured by125I-ASOR binding activity, was determined. Rapamycin treatment reduced surface binding of ASOR in HuH7 cells in a dose-dependent fashion, reaching a minimum of 45 ± 5.7% at 3 μm for 24 h (Fig.3). Inhibition of ASOR binding by the antibiotic was also time-dependent, reaching a maximum of 48 ± 3% of control within 3 h at 1 μm, with an initial 28 ± 5% reduction of binding activity evident as early as 2 h (Fig. 4). In contrast to HuH-7 cells, cell surface ASOR binding was not reduced in rapamycin-treated Trf1 cells (Fig. 4) even when treatment was extended to 24 h at 3 μm (data not shown).Figure 4Trf1 cells do not respond to rapamycin.HuH-7 and Trf1 cells were treated with rapamycin (1 μm) for increasing times. Cell surface ASGPR activity was determined by125I-ASOR binding as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values shown are the means ± S.D. of three independent experiments. The reduction of cell surface ASGPR expression induced by rapamycin was time-dependent and limited to the HuH-7 cell line.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the loss of ASOR binding activity was the result of an inhibition of trafficking or inactivation of cell surface receptors, ASGPR expression was measured independently of its binding activity. Following cell surface biotinylation, ASGPR was immunoprecipitated, and the amounts of total and biotinylated receptor were quantified. Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitate showed that treatment with rapamycin had no effect on the level of total receptor (Fig. 5). There was significantly less receptor on the surface of rapamycin-treated HuH7 cells than on nontreated cells. Consistent with the binding assay (Fig.3), the antibiotic had no effect on the level of surface receptors in Trf1 cells (Fig. 5). Rapamycin-induced reduction in the plasma membrane ASGPR content of HuH-7 cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent microscopic localization of receptor on nonpermeabilized cells (Fig.6). In agreement with the biochemical data, treatment of HuH-7 cells markedly reduced immunodetectable plasma membrane associated ASGPR.Figure 6Reduction of surface ASGPR expression in response to rapamycin. Following rapamycin treatment (1 μm) for 24 h, the cell surface density of ASGPR was evaluated by immunofluorescence. Fixed nonpermeabilized HuH-7 cells were incubated with anti-ASGPR antibody (1:200) and the deposition of antibody detected with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit (1:100). Images were acquired on an Olympus IX70 fluorescent microscope equipped with a CCD digital camera. Control experiments without primary antibody incubation showed no signal. The figure is a representative field from two independent sets of experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the reduction of cell surface ASGPR by rapamycin treatment was coincident with disruption of the sorting complex, the lysate of rapamycin treated cells was passed through a GST-phosphorylated ASGPR-CD column. As an alternative approach, cells with or without prior rapamycin treatment were lysed with CHAPS to retain protein-protein interactions, and the receptor and any associated proteins were co-immunoadsorbed to covalently bound anti-ASGPR. Proteins recovered by either protocol were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membranes were probed with antibodies to HSP90 and HSP70 (Fig7). These results indicate that whereas total HSP70 and HSP90 expression is unaffected by rapamycin treatment, the association of HSPs 70 and 90 with GST-phosphorylated ASGPR-CD was markedly reduced by antibiotic treatment (Fig. 7 A). Immunoprecipitation of ASGPR from rapamycin-treated HuH-7 cells showed a dramatic reduction in receptor-associated HPS70 and HSP90 without affecting receptor expression (Fig. 7 B). The addition of a large excess of GST-phosphorylated ASGPR-CD to the lysis buffer did not alter the recovery of HSP associated with ASGPR recovered from nontreated cells, suggesting that the initial interaction had occurred in vivo (data not shown). Consistent with a potential role for the HSP heterocomplex in the trafficking of ASGPR, immunoprecipitation of the receptor from Trf1 cells did not result in the co-precipitation of HSP70 and a markedly reduced level of HSP90, independent of rapamycin treatment (Fig.7 B). To eliminate the possibility that the FKBP-rapamycin complex, which inhibits the kinase activator target of rapamycin (TOR) (15Schmelzle T. Hall M.N. Cell. 2000; 103: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), might have a downstream effect on CK2α′′ activity, the receptor was immunoprecipitated from antibiotic-treated cells, and the level of phosphorylation was determined. As shown in figure 8, the rapamycin-induced mimicry of thetrf1 mutation is not caused by a reduction of receptor phosphorylation.Figure 8Effect of rapamycin on ASGPR phosphorylation. ASGPR was immunoprecipitated from equal amounts of cell lysate protein from confluent HuH-7 cells (2 × 106/60-mm dish) treated or not treated with rapamycin (1 μm for 24 h). Following resolution on 8% SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. The extent of serine phosphorylation was determined by probing the membrane with mouse anti-serine-P antibody, and antibody deposition was visualized by chemiluminescence after incubation with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. Typical results from four independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In our previous reports, a membrane protein trafficking mutant (Trf1) derived from the human hepatoma cell line HuH7 was shown to be defective in the distribution of subpopulations of cell surface receptors for asialo-orsomucoid, transferrin, and mannose-terminating glycoproteins (3Stockert R.J.

Interestingly, likely physiological targets for CK2 include a number of cytoplasmic proteins that regulate intracellular trafficking (16Karki S. Tokito M.K. Holzbaur E.L. J. Biol.

Kinase and phosphatase activities have been shown to control both general and cargo-specific trafficking (19Mostov K.E. Histol. Histopathol. 1995; 10: 423-431PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, CK2 phosphorylates proteins that traffic between the Golgi and the plasma membrane. For example, CK2-mediated phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic tail of the proprotein convertase, furin, is required for its localization to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (10Paietta E. Stockert R.J.

Interestingly, early endosomal localization of internalized transferrin was unaffected by PACS-1 depletion (22Molloy S.S. Thomas L. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Thomas G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1399-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), although it was shown that internalization of the transferrin receptor requires CK2 or a CK2-like kinase, suggesting the presence of a yet undefined CK2- dependent retrieval protein or proteins. Utilizing the phosphorylated ASGPR-CD as bait, we isolated a heterocomplex of potential sorting proteins comprising members of both the heat shock and immunophilin families. The major heat shock proteins, HSP90 and HSP70, are well recognized molecular chaperones that are required for the proper folding and trafficking of many proteins involved in signal transduction (34Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 35Pearl L.H. Prodromou C. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 46-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Recently, gp96, HSP90, and HSP70 were shown to selectively associate with tumor-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte epitopes, implying that this combination of HSP can act in distinct intracellular compartments to traffic antigenic peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules (36Ishii T. Udono H. Yamano T. Ohta H. Uenaka A. Ono T. Hizuta A. Tanaka N. Srivastava P.K. Nakayama E. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1303-1309PubMed Google Scholar). Recovery of immunophilins within the ASGPR-CD heterocomplex was consistent with previous reports demonstrating that steroid receptor heterocomplexes often contain several proteins that possess tetratricopeptide repeats, which are degenerative sequences of 34 amino acids involved in protein-protein interactions (37Blatch G.L. Lassle M. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 932-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Such proteins include members of the immunophilin family, such as the recovered FKBP and cyclosporin A-binding protein. In as much as immunophilins have been shown to exist in independent heat shock protein heterocomplexes (38Pratt W.B. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1998; 217: 420-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), the recovered proteins that are associated with the ASGPR-CD may reflect a mixture of potential sorting heterocomplexes, each with a different temporal function regulating ASGPR trafficking. Treatment of parental HuH-7 cells with the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin mimicked the Trf1 phenotype by decreasing cell surface ASGPR by ∼50% without affecting total receptor expression or phosphorylation. Trf1 cells exhibit a pleiotropic phenotype that alters not only ASGPR and transferrin receptor expression but also the trafficking of additional unrelated plasma membrane proteins (4Stockert R.J. Spray D.C. Gao Y. Suadicani S.O. Ripley C.R. Novikoff P.M. Wolkoff A.W. Hertzberg E.L. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 740-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thetrf1 mutation results in an ∼50% reduction in the cell surface expression of susceptible proteins at the plasma membrane. Early studies established the functional (39Stockert R.J. Howard D.J. Morell A.G. Scheinberg I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9028-9029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and metabolic (40Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Strous G.J. Luzio J.P. Schwartz A.L. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2677-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) separation of the cell surface ASGPR population from that of the larger intracellular receptor pool. This concept of two subsets of surface receptors, designated States 1 and 2 by Weigel and Oka (41Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1150-1154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), has continued to gained support. Although the biochemical basis for these two types of receptor has not been established, changes in phosphorylation (42Haynes P.A. Medh J.D. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 33152-33158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and acylation (43Weigel P.H. Oka J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27186-27190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were suggested to affect the transition from State 1 to State 2. Only State 2 receptors are proposed to be susceptible to modulation by a variety of cell perturbants, including reduced temperature, colchicine, cytokines, phorbol esters, monensin and chloroquine, azide, vanadate, or ethanol (44Weigel P.H. Subcell. Biochem. 1993; 19: 125-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In all cases, these agents cause an approximate 50% reduction in cell surface ASGPR activity, and in some cases, a redistribution of cell surface receptors was confirmed as the cause for this reduction. The selective reduction of cell surface ASGPR in Trf1 cells also appeared to be due to the redistribution of State 2 receptors to an internal pool (3Stockert R.J. Potvin B. Tao L. Stanley P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16107-16113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The failure of the Trf1 cell line to respond to rapamycin (Fig. 4) indicates that the distribution of State 1 receptors is not responsive to the antibiotic. This notion is consistent with the newly described H2c isoform of the receptor (45Yik J.H. Saxena A. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23076-23083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), which lacks a CK2 phosphorylation motif. As suggested by the authors, State 2 receptors would contain H1-H2b and would be responsive to CK2α′′ phosphorylation, whereas State 1 receptors, containing H1-H2c, would not be affected by the antibiotic. Analysis of the ASGPR-CD heterocomplex following rapamycin treatment indicated that the antibiotic prevented the formation or disrupted the association of HSP with the ASGPR-CD (Fig. 6). In a somewhat analogous study, evidence was presented that the cytosolic HSP-immunophilin chaperone complex of caveolin, when disrupted by rapamycin, prevents rapid cholesterol transport to the plasma membrane (14Uittenbogaard A. Ying Y. Smart E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6525-6532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Although it has been proposed that the rapid insertion of caveolin into the plasma membrane is microtubule-based, the question of whether the inhibition of caveolin trafficking by rapamycin was due to the disruption of microtubular interaction was not resolved (11Conrad P.A. Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1421-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In a recent study, it was shown that dynein, a molecular motor for minus end movement along microtubules, was present in glucocorticoid receptor HSP90 heterocomplexes, and it was suggested that FKBP provided the molecular link between the receptor heterocomplex and cytoplasmic dynein (46Silverstein A.M. Galigniana M.D. Kanelakis K.C. Radanyi C. Renoir J.M. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36980-36986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Trafficking of ASGPR containing vesicles along the microtubular network is well established (47Bananis E. Murray J.W. Stockert R.J. Satir P. Wolkoff A.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 179-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and the dynamic interaction of its heat shock protein-immunophilin complex with specific molecular motors could provide the direction necessary to maintain the steady state distribution of the receptor. Based on these results, we propose that the interaction of a heterocomplex containing a combination of gp96, HSP90, HSP70, FKBP-18, and cyclophilin-A is dependent upon phosphorylation of ASGPR-CD by CK2α′′ and that this differential phosphorylation establishes the distribution of ASGPR between the plasma membrane and the endosomal pool."
https://openalex.org/W1986548939,"DNAs from 1,3-butadiene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas of B6C3F1 mice were examined for mutations in the Trp53 gene, the ras gene family and several components of the Wnt signaling pathway, including beta-catenin (Catnb), Apc and Axin. Trp53 mutations were detected in 41% (7 out of 17) of tumors. Each tumor with a Trp53 mutation also exhibited loss of the wild-type Trp53 allele, supporting the importance of Trp53 inactivation during development of these tumors. Analyses of the Hras1, Kras2 and Nras proto-oncogenes revealed Hras1 mutations in 53% (9 out of 17) of tumors. Seven of these mutations were a G-->C transversion in Hras1 codon 13, consistent with a 1,3-butadiene-specific Kras2 mutation previously reported in several other tumor types. Mutation screens in Catnb exon 2, the Apc mutation cluster region and the Catnb-binding domain of the Axin gene identified Catnb missense mutations in 3 out of 17 (18%) tumors. In total, mutations of the Trp53, Hras1 and/or Catnb genes were identified in 15 out of 17 1,3-butadiene-induced mammary adenocarcinomas. These results indicate that multiple genetic pathways are disrupted in chemically induced mammary tumors, and that studies in mouse models may help to understand the etiology of human breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W1983041240,"Previous work with the bovine phenol sulfotransferase (bSULT1A1, EC 2.8.2.1) demonstrated inhibition by CoA that was competitive with respect to the sulfuryl donor substrate, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Leach, M., Cameron, E., Fite, N., Stassinopoulos, J., Palmreuter, N., and Beckmann, J. D. (1999) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 261, 815–819). Here we report that long chain acyl-CoAs are more potent inhibitors of bSULT1A1 and also of human dopamine sulfotransferase (SULT1A3) when compared with unesterified CoA and short chain-length acyl-CoAs. A complex pattern of inhibition was revealed by systematic variation of palmitoyl-CoA, PAPS, and 7-hydroxycoumarin, the acceptor substrate. Convex plots of apparentK m/V max versus[palmitoyl-CoA] were adequately modeled using an ordered rapid equilibrium scheme with PAPS as the leading substrate and by accounting for the possible binding of two equivalents of inhibitor to the dimeric enzyme. Interestingly, the first K i of 2–3 μm was followed by a second K i of only 0.01–0.05 μm, suggesting that positive subunit cooperativity enhances binding of long chain acyl-CoAs to this sulfotransferase. Simultaneous interaction of palmitoyl-CoA with both the nucleotide and phenol binding sites is suggested by two experiments. First, the acyl-CoA displaced 7-hydroxycoumarin from the highly fluorescent bSULT1A1·PAP·7-HC complex in a cooperative manner. Second, palmitoyl-CoA prevented the quenching of bSULT1A1 fluorescence observed with pentachlorophenol. Finally, titrations of bSULT1A1-pentachlorophenol complex with palmitoyl-CoA caused the return of protein fluorescence, and the binding of palmitoyl-CoA was highly cooperative (Hill constant of 1.9). Overall, these results suggest a model of sulfotransferase inhibition in which the 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-diphosphate moiety of CoA docks to the PAPS domain, and the acyl-pantetheine group docks to the hydrophobic phenol binding domain. Previous work with the bovine phenol sulfotransferase (bSULT1A1, EC 2.8.2.1) demonstrated inhibition by CoA that was competitive with respect to the sulfuryl donor substrate, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) (Leach, M., Cameron, E., Fite, N., Stassinopoulos, J., Palmreuter, N., and Beckmann, J.

Mulder G.J. Sulfation of Drugs and Related Compounds. CRC Press, CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1981: 83-130Google Scholar, 2Matsui M. Homma H. Int. J.

The common sulfuryl group donor substrate is 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS),1 with which a sulfate ester and adenosine-3′,5′-bisphosphate (PAP) are generated as products. The isolation of sulfotransferase cDNAs and genes during the previous decade along with the expression and purification of recombinant enzymes has expanded our knowledge of the diversity and functions of this enzyme family (4Weinshilboum R.M. Otterness D.M. Aksoy I.A. Wood T.C. Her C. Raftogianis R.B. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 3-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Important insights have been gained regarding the structures and chemical mechanisms of sulfotransferases (5Kakuta Y. Petrotchenko E.V. Pedersen L.C. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27325-27330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 6Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch.

Coughtrie M.W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37862-37868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A highly conserved feature is a histidyl residue in the vicinity of position 108, which may serve as a general base in acceptor substrate proton abstraction. The binding site of PAPS includes conserved lysyl, arginyl, and seryl groups, and acceptor substrate specificity is determined in part by the charge in its binding domain. Many cytosolic sulfotransferases are dimeric, and the dimerization domain has been identified as a relatively simple hydrophobic zipper stabilized on the ends by salt bridges (6Negishi M. Pedersen L.G. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Gorokhov A. Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2001; 390: 149-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The simplicity of the dimerization domain may explain the observation of heterodimeric sulfotransferases purified from rat liver (8Kiehlbauch C.C. Lam Y.F. Ringer D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18941-18947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The role of subunit dimerization in sulfotransferase function is currently under investigation. The tight binding of only 1 eq of PAP per dimeric rat aryl sulfotransferase IV suggests a structural limitation to ligand binding in that enzyme (9Yang Y.-S. Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Guo W.A. Xie X. Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, PAP-dependent cooperativity has been reported for the binding of pentachlorophenol to the bovine SULT1A1 (10Beckmann J.D. Henry T. Ulphani J. Lee P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there is little evidence to date for a role of subunit interactions during sulfotransferase catalytic turnover. A variety of steady state kinetic mechanisms have been reported for different sulfotransferases. Partially purified guinea pig liver phenol sulfotransferase was reported to obey a rapid equilibrium random bi bi pattern (11Banerjee R.K. Roy A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 151: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas partially purified rat brain phenol sulfotransferase displayed a sequential ordered bisubstrate mechanism with PAPS as the leading substrate (12Pennings E.J.M. Vrielink R. van Kempen G.M.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 173: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A random mechanism was also reported for the more highly purified rat liver aryl (phenol) sulfotransferase IV (13Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although it was noted that an ordered Theorell-Chance mechanism was also consistent with the data. Characterization of the human phenol (SULT1A1) and dopamine (SULT1A3) sulfotransferases revealed ordered bi bi mechanisms with PAPS as the leading substrate (14Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A. Biochem. 1985; 24: 2477-2482Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 15Whittemore R.M. Pearce L.B. Roth J.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1986; 249: 464-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Some caution is warranted as we look back on work performed with partially purified nonrecombinant enzymes; however, all reports provide a consistent picture that PAPS can bind to the enzyme in the absence of a phenol. This is supported by the frequent use of nucleotide agaroses for affinity purification (16Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5658-5663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Leach M. Cameron E. Fite N. Stassinopoulos J. Palmreuter N. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chen X. Jakoby W.B. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and by recent crystallization of mouse estrogen sulfotransferase complexes with PAP and PAPS (18Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Much emphasis has been placed on elucidating substrate specificities for various members of the sulfotransferase family (16Sekura R.D. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5658-5663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which often display overlapping reactivities with many acceptor substrates. Quantitative structure activity relationships have revealed clear differences between the human phenol sulfotransferase (SULT1A1) and the dopamine sulfotransferase (SULT1A3) (7Dajani R. Cleasby A. Neu M. Wonacott A.J. Jhoti H. Hood A.M. Modi S. Hersey A. Taskinen J. Cooke R.M. Manchee G.R. Coughtrie M.W.H. J. Biol.

Pharmacol. 1987; 32: 813-819PubMed Google Scholar). Equally important, however, is the likely role that biomolecules play in regulating sulfoconjugation reactions. Exogenous inhibitors include polyphenolic compounds (20Bamforth K.J. Jones A.L. Roberts R.C. Coughtrie M.W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1993; 46: 1713-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21Eaton E.A. Walle U.K. Lewis A.J. Hudson T. Wilson A.A. Walle T. Drug Metab.

Commun. 1999; 261: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The latter is of interest due to its overt structural overlap with PAP, another potent sulfotransferase inhibitor (26Rens-Domiano S.S. Roth J.A. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) generated by normal enzymatic turnover. CoA was found to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to PAPS of the bovine phenol sulfotransferase (bSULT1A1) (17Leach M. Cameron E. Fite N. Stassinopoulos J. Palmreuter N. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), an enzyme with very similar sequence and substrate specificity compared with the human SULT1A1 enzyme (27Schauss S.J. Henry T. Palmatier R. Halvorson L. Dannenbring R. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a ubiquitous biomolecule, CoA fulfills several metabolic and regulatory roles. Whereas the mitochondrial CoA pool is probably not relevant for this investigation, cytosolic CoA is a vital component in fatty acid catabolism, lipid biosynthesis, and drug metabolism (28Brass E.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 90: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar,29Roberts B.J. Macleod J.K. Singh I. Knights K.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 49: 1335-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The acylation status of this CoA pool is a dynamic parameter that can shift dramatically depending on cellular physiological conditions (28Brass E.P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1994; 90: 203-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Carregal A.V.M. Testoni G. Dalamon V. Savino E.A. Arch. Physiol. Biochem. 1997; 105: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). This, in turn, could alter its effects on enzymes such as sulfotransferases. Therefore, we have sought to extend our prior work by comparing the inhibition of bSULT1A1 by various acylated CoAs. The complete characterization of the kinetics of this inhibition indicates an unanticipated complex kinetic pattern that required accounting for inhibitor binding to a dimeric enzyme. These results may reveal an aspect of sulfotransferase catalysis not previously uncovered, namely positive subunit interactions. Buffers and salts were of the highest purity available from either Sigma or Fisher. 2-Naphthol and 2-naphthyl sulfate were from Fluka (Milwaukee, WI) and Research Organics (Cleveland, OH), respectively. CoA and acyl-CoAs, PAPS, PAP, pentachlorophenol (PCP), and 7-hydroxycoumarin (7-HC) were from Sigma. CoAs, PAPS, and PAP were dissolved in water, quantified by absorbance (A = 15.4/mm at 260 nm), and stored frozen as 1–200 mm aliquots. PCP and 7-HC were dissolved in ethanol at 1 m and 0.1 m by mass, respectively, and kept at −20 °C in the dark. These reagents were diluted in water to ∼100 μm working stocks immediately before use. For some experiments, the commercially available PAPS was purified by ion exchange FPLC. Approximately 0.2 μmol of PAPS was bound to a Resource Q column equilibrated with 50 mm triethylamine carbonate, pH 7.6, followed by a 15-ml linear gradient to 1m buffer. The PAPS peak was collected and lyophilized to remove volatile buffer components and then dissolved in water and quantified by absorbance. When directly comparing unpurified to purified PAPS in bSULT1A1-catalyzed reactions, however, we did not observe any significant differences in either rates or steady state kinetic parameters (not shown). Recombinant bovine phenol sulfotransferase (bSULT1A1) was purified fromE. coli DH5α harboring the pTrc-PST cDNA expression vector as previously described (10Beckmann J.D. Henry T. Ulphani J. Lee P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27Schauss S.J. Henry T. Palmatier R. Halvorson L. Dannenbring R. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), except that the final molecular exclusion over AcA34 was replaced by FPLC through Sephacryl S-200 (Amersham Biosciences, Hi-Prep 26/60). Aliquots of enzyme were stored at −80 °C at 1–2 mg/ml in Buffer B (20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). Recombinant human dopamine sulfotransferase (SULT1A3) was purified fromE. coli DE3 harboring hM-PST-pET-11a, kindly provided by Dr. Michael Coughtrie. The purification method followed was that used for the bovine SULT1A1 enzyme. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent and bovine serum albumin as the relative standard. bSULT1A1 molarity was calculated assuming a molecular mass of 32 kDa (27Schauss S.J. Henry T. Palmatier R. Halvorson L. Dannenbring R. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and hSULT1A3 concentration assumed a subunit mass of 34 kDa (31Dajani R. Sharp S. Graham S. Bethell S.S. Cooke R.M. Jamieson D.J. Coughtrie M.W.H. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 16: 11-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Measurement of bSULT1A1 activity was performed by observing the decrease in 7-HC fluorescence essentially as described by Leach et al. (17Leach M. Cameron E. Fite N. Stassinopoulos J. Palmreuter N. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), in which 50-μl reactions initiated in timed sequence were then sequentially stopped after 5–20 min with an equal volume of 0.5 m Tris-Cl, 0.1% SDS, pH 8.5. The assay buffer was 25 mm sodium phosphate, 25 mm sodium succinate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 5.5, a previously reported optimum for this enzyme (32Beckmann J.D. Spurzem J.R. Rennard S.I. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 274: 475-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). If the concentrations of fluorescent 7-HC exceeded 1 μm, then sufficient Tris/SDS was added to dilute the total 7-HC to 1 μm. The fluorescence intensities of the quenched reactions were then measured using a Hoefer DyNA Quant fluorimeter and 50-μl capillary cuvettes. The instrument was frequently blanked and calibrated with a sample of 1.0 μm 7-HC, which was within the linear instrumental response. Several precautionary measurements were made to ensure assay validity; first, no substrate was ever depleted beyond 20% of its starting value; second, the incubation times and enzyme concentrations fell within linear dependence; third, the inhibition by the CoAs in the assay buffer was time-independent. Concentrations of PAPS and 7-HC were varied as indicated in the figure legends. To accurately measure a decrease in 7-HC fluorescence during the PAPS variations, we found it necessary to hold the acceptor substrate at 0.2 μm. This is sub-saturating and has the consequence of reduced rates in comparison to the 7-HC variation experiments (e.g. Fig. 3 versus Fig. 4). In contrast, for assays in which 7-HC was varied, the PAPS concentration was held at 10 μm. This higher concentration drove greater reaction rates and allowed estimation of the true turnover number (TN) of the reaction.Figure 4Effect of varied 7-HC concentration on the inhibition of bovine SULT1A1 by palmitoyl-CoA. Rates of 7-HC sulfation (see “Methods” under “Experimental Procedures”) are expressed as nmol of product/min/nmol of enzyme subunits (v/E). Each point in the upper Lineweaver-Burk plot is the average of triplicate measurements that typically varied by less than 10% (error bars are not shown for sake of clarity). Palmitoyl-CoA (P-CoA) concentrations were 0 (open circles), 0.2 μm (closed circles), 0.4 μm(open triangles), 0.6 μm (closed triangles), and 0.8 μm (open squares). The statistically weighted linear fits (see “Methods” under “Experimental Procedures”) provided the slopes that are replotted in the lower panel. The curve was drawn using the slope portion of Equation 4 of Table I and the parameters summarized in TableII.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Human SULT1A3 activity was determined fluorimetrically by the method of Arand (33Arand M. Robertson L.W. Oesch F. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 163: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), in which the formation of 2-naphthyl sulfate is measured. Incubations of 100 μl included 5 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.8, 5 μm PAPS, and 25 μm 2-naphthol. CoA and palmitoyl-CoA concentrations in the assays were varied as indicated (Fig. 2). Emission intensities were measured with an SLM-AMINCO 8000 spectrofluorimeter (285 nm excitation, 335 nm emission), and relative activities were calculated compared with controls in the absence of inhibitors. Care was taken to select incubation times and enzyme concentration that displayed linearity, and all measurements were conducted in triplicate. Kinetic data (Figs. 3 and 4) were numerically analyzed as follows. Initial rates were divided by bSULT1A1 subunit concentration, thereby directly providing turnover number (TN) values. Because of the apparent complexity of the inhibition patterns, attempts were made to use a sophisticated software package (Enzfitter, Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) to fit the data to several common mechanisms. However, no equation or algorithm provided a satisfactory model of the data as revealed by excessive standard errors or nonrandom residual distribution (not shown). The apparent cooperativity of inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA (Fig.1) suggested that a model would need to account for subunit-subunit interactions. Therefore, additional binding schemes were considered that included mixed substrate and inhibitor binding to a dimeric enzyme. Derivation of rapid equilibrium equations was by standard approaches (34Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics: Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), and the simplest scheme that yielded graphical predictions consistent with the data is provided (Fig. 5).Figure 5Proposed rapid equilibrium kinetic model describing the catalysis by bSULT1A1 and its inhibition by palmitoyl-CoA.

The dissociation constants are defined in Table I.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Experimental data were then fit to the model as follows. Triplicate rates for a set of varied substrate concentrations for a single concentration of inhibitor were entered into a spreadsheet (Cricket Graph) configured to perform the statistical weighting calculations of Wilkinson (35Wilkinson G.N. Biochem. J. 1961; 80: 324-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (2722) Google Scholar). For visualization, traditional Lineweaver-Burk plots were constructed displaying the average velocities and the weighted fits. The slopes of these fits (K m/TN) were subsequently plotted against palmitoyl-CoA concentration. Fittings of the slope replots according to the slope portions of Equations 3 and 4 (Table I) were conducted manually in an iterative process. Initial selections of the equation parametersK s1, K s2, and TN were made based on rate data in the absence of inhibitor. Co-substrate concentrations were known experimental parameters. The IC50 value (0.24 μm) of palmitoyl-CoA inhibition (Fig. 1) was used as initial estimates ofK i1 andK i2, and α was initially set to 1. It was decided to restrain K i2 from decreasing below 0.01 μm, the point at which inhibition of bSULT1A1 activity could be detected (Fig. 1). The parameters for the two sets of data (Figs. 3 and 4) were then varied independently until visual fits of the experimental slope replots were achieved. Refinements of the fits were then made while minimizing the sum of the squared residuals for each replot, and parameters between the two experiments were progressively converged in small increments. After six iterations, no further minimization of summated squared residuals could be achieved, and the final fits and parameters are reported in Figs. 3 and 4 and Table II.Table IDefinitions of dissociation constants and rapid equilibrium-derived kinetics equations Ks1=[E·E][S1][E·ES1]Ks2=[E·ES1][S2][E·ES1S2] Ki=[E·E][I][EI·E]Ki2=[EI·E][I][EI·EI] αKs1=[EI·E][S1][EI·ES1]βKs2=[EI·ES1][S2][EI·ES1S2]αKi1=[E·ES1][I][EI·ES1]αβKi1=[E·ES1S2][I][EI·ES1S2] TN=kcat[E·ES1S2][E·E]t=Vmax[E·E]t v[E·E]t=kcat[E·ES1S2][E·E]+[E·ES1]+[E·ES1S2]+[EI·E]+[EI·ES1]+[EI·ES1S2]+[EI·EI] (Eq. 2)Grouping by S1: Ev=Ks1·Ks2TN·[S2]{1+[I]Ki1+[I]2Ki1·Ki2}1[S1]+1TN{1+Ks2[S2]+Ks2·[I]α[S2]Ki1+[I]αβKi1} (Eq. 3)Grouping by S2: Ev=Ks2TN{1+Ks1[S1]+Ks1[I][S1]Ki1+[I]αKi1+Ks1[I]2[S1]Ki1Ki2}1[S2]+1TN{1+[I]αβKi1}(Eq.4) Open table in a new tab Table IISummary of kinetic constantsParameterVaried PAPS (S1)Varied 7-HC (S2)[PAPS], μm10[7-HC], μm0.20Ks 1, μm1.401.45Ks 2, μm1.901.67TN (min−1)9.010.2Ki 1, μm3.22.12Ki 2, μm0.050.01α0.65See Fig. 5 and Table I for the binding scheme and parameter definitions.

Fluorescence emission spectra were measured using an SLM-AMINCO 8000 spectrofluorimeter with an excitation wavelength of 280 nm. Excited tryptophanyl emission energy is apparently transferred to bound 7-HC, which displays an enhanced emission around 400–420 nm. 2J. D. Beckmann, R. J. Burkett, M. Sharpe, L. Giannunzio, D. Johnston, S. Abbey, A. Wyman, and L. Sung, submitted for publication. All spectra were recorded at ambient temperature and were corrected for the small dilutions due to titrant additions. For most experiments, 1.50-ml samples in Buffer B included a magnetic stirrer in the quartz cuvette. Fluorimeter shutters were closed unless spectra were being recorded to minimize UV exposure time. Titrations with stock solutions of CoA, palmitoyl-CoA, or PCP were such that 2–5-μl additions of reagent were made, followed by at least 2 min for mixing and equilibration. Preliminary experiments demonstrated that this was sufficient time for binding equilibration to occur (not shown). Quenching of bSULT1A1 fluorescence with PCP was performed by titrations of 2.0 μm solutions of enzyme essentially as previously described (10Beckmann J.D. Henry T. Ulphani J. Lee P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Emission intensities at 338 nm were recorded using 280 nm excitation, and mock titrations were performed to provide empirical dilution correction factors. Inclusion of PAPS, CoA, or palmitoyl-CoA (5 μm) reduced the initial emission intensity by at most 5%, which is likely due to an excitation inner filter effect. Therefore, fluorescence values are expressed as percent relative to the sample lacking PCP. Final concentrations of PCP could not exceed about 5 μm without introducing a further inner filter artifact (10Beckmann J.D. Henry T. Ulphani J. Lee P. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), thus precluding reliable titration data at greater PCP concentrations (Fig. 8). It was also possible to titrate the quenched bSULT1A1·PCP complex with palmitoyl-CoA (Fig. 9). The 335-nm emission of 0.50 μm enzyme in Buffer B was recorded followed by the addition of 3 μm PCP, which reduced the fluorescence by 25–30%. Subsequent additions of palmitoyl-CoA caused the return of protein emission to near starting values. Data were corrected for dilution and inner filter effects by performing mock titrations of free enzyme with palmitoyl-CoA or PCP-bound enzyme with 5′-AMP, which apparently did not displace PCP from the enzyme. Averaged data from three titrations that varied by less than 5% were modeled with a Hill-type equation (36DeLean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by minimizing the sum of squared residuals. Analytical molecular exclusion column chromatography (Fig. 10) was performed with a Amersham Biosciences FPLC system. The Superdex 200HR column was eluted at 1 ml/min with Buffer B (above) containing 50 mm NaCl. Size standards (bovine serum albumin, chicken ovalbumin, and β-lactoglobulin) were from Sigma. Preliminary experiments indicated that 40 μm palmitoyl-CoA increased the apparent size of bSULT1A1 in a time-dependent manner over a period of several hours. Therefore, to obtain final equilibrated states, the enzyme (0.6 mg/ml) was incubated with varied concentrations of palmitoyl-CoA for 24 h at ambient temperature before chromatography. Fractions (1 ml) were collected and assayed for bSULT1A1 activity (see above). Previous work demonstrated the inhibition of bSULT1A1 by CoA, and we sought to determine whether various CoA thioesters might exhibit similar or different inhibition in comparison. An overall assessment was therefore made of CoA, acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA across a broad range of concentrations (Fig. 1). The IC50 value for CoA of 33 μm was consistent with prior work (17Leach M. Cameron E. Fite N. Stassinopoulos J. Palmreuter N. Beckmann J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 815-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), and this dose response overlapped those of acetyl-CoA (IC50 = 39 μm) and malonyl-CoA (IC50 = 40 μm). The longer chain-length acyl-CoAs, however, were clearly more potent bSULT1A1 inhibitors, with palmitoyl-CoA (IC50 = 0.24 μm) being 5 times more effective than octanoyl-CoA (IC50 = 1.25 μm).

Unlike other gelsolin-related proteins, fragmin60 contains a unique N-terminal domain that shows similarity with C2 domains of aczonin, protein kinase C, and synaptotagmins. The fragmin60 C2 domain binds three calcium ions, one with nanomolar affinity and two with micromolar affinity. Actin binding by fragmin60 requires higher calcium concentrations than does binding of actin by a fragmin60 mutant lacking the C2 domain, suggesting that the C2 domain secures the actin binding moiety in a conformation preventing actin binding at low calcium concentrations. The fragmin60 C2 domain does not bind phospholipids but interacts with the endogenous homologue ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae S-phase kinase-associated protein (Skp1), as shown by pull-down assays and co-expression in mammalian cells. Recombinant fragmin60 promotes in vitrophosphorylation of actin Thr-203 by the actin-fragmin kinase. We further show that in vivo phosphorylation of actin in the fragmin60-actin complex occurs in sclerotia, a dormant stage ofPhysarum development, as well as in plasmodia.

Supervillin (205 kDa), a membrane-interacting protein, contains an N-terminal domain with nuclear targeting signals in addition to a C-terminal half with weak similarity to villin (23Pestonjamasp K.N.

In this study we describe a new fragmin-related protein fromPhysarum, fragmin60, which harbors an N-terminal C2 domain in addition to three segments of the gelsolin-like core. C2 domains are independently folding modules of ∼130 amino acid residues that are present as single or multiple copies in proteins. C2 modules occur in a variety of proteins, most of which have a role in cell signaling such as phospholipases, protein kinases, activators of GTPases, and proteins involved in membrane trafficking such as synaptotagmins (reviewed in Refs. 25Li C.

They have diverged evolutionarily into Ca2+-dependent and Ca2+-independent forms that interact with multiple targets. Most studied C2 domains bind lipids in a Ca2+-dependent way, but can also associate with protein partners in a Ca2+-dependent or -independent manner. Some representatives are able to bind inositol polyphosphates. Here we show that the C2 domain of fragmin60, although it binds three calcium ions with high affinity, does not interact with phospholipids but associates with the Skp1 homologue fromPhysarum in a calcium-independent manner. Previously, we showed that fragminP and fragminA both possess a unique quality by promoting phosphorylation of actin in vitro at Thr-203 by the actin-fragmin kinase (AFK), a protein kinase with akelch domain and a catalytic domain that contains barely 5 conserved amino acids encountered in regular protein kinases (16Gettemans J., De Ville Y.

Immunopositive fractions were collected, dialyzed against buffer for hydroxyapatite chromatography (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm KH2PO4, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF), and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (2 cm × 15 cm). Proteins were eluted with a gradient of KH2PO4 (10–250 mm) in hydroxyapatite buffer. Positive fractions were collected and precipitated overnight with 2 volumes of ethanol. The ethanol precipitate was air-dried and dissolved in 9.5 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 1.6% ampholines, pH 5–7, 0.4% ampholines, pH 3.5–10, and 100 mm DTT. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was performed according to Ref. 35Garrels J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7961-7977Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. The position of fragmin60 on two-dimensional gels was determined by Western blotting using anti-fragminP antibodies. Protein spots corresponding to fragmin60 were excised from multiple Coomassie-stained gels and equilibrated in SDS-containing buffer, and the protein was electro-eluted and concentrated according to Ref. 36Gevaert K.

Approximately 10 μg of protein were digested in gel using endolysin-C or trypsin (sequencing grade). Extracted peptides were separated on a narrow-bore C4reversed-phase column as described in Ref. 37De Corte V. Gettemans J. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar. Amino acid sequence analysis was performed on a model 477A pulsed liquid-phase sequenator equipped with a model 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). A cDNA library was constructed from Physarumplasmodial poly(A)+-enriched RNA by priming reverse transcription with oligo(dT) and a mixture of random hexanucleotides. Complementary DNA was synthesized by using the SuperScriptTM Choice System (Invitrogen) according to the instructions from the manufacturer. First round PCR was done using a pair of degenerate primers, designed on two peptides that are homologous to the N-terminal part of fragminP (ARHEAAW, 5′-GCNMGICAYGARGCNGCNTGG-3′ as forward (+) primer, and DDFLGGA, 5′-NGCICCNCCIARRAARTCRTC-3′ as reverse (−) primer). PCR reactions were done using 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase, 1 μm of both primers, and ∼1 ng of double-stranded DNA. 35 cycles of PCR were performed in a thermocycler (Biometra) under the following conditions: 95 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 2 min, 72 °C, 30 s, followed by a final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting PCR product of 280 bp was cloned into the pCR®2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) and sequenced. Based on the sequence of the PCR product, non-degenerate forward and reverse primers were designed. A 27-mer fragmin60-specific oligonucleotide: 5′-GTATGCGGCAGTTCCGGCTTCATCTTG-3′ was used as reverse primer in combination with the 5′ LD Amplimer (5′-CTCGGGAAGCGCGCCATTGTGTTGGT-3′) from the LD-Insert Screening Amplimer Sets (Clontech) for walking in the 5′ direction of the cDNA. Reactions were carried out using TaqPCR Core Kit (Qiagen, Leusden, the Netherlands) using 2.5 pmol of both primers, 1 ng of template DNA, and cycle parameters recommended by the instructions from the manufacturer. A PCR product of 900 bp was obtained and subcloned in the pCR2.1 shuttle vector. Finally, a non-degenerate primer was designed (5′-TTCGTGAATGGAGCCCAAGCAAGGATAC-3′) for walking in the 3′ direction in combination with a 3′ LD Amplimer in the same conditions as for the previous reaction. Both strands of two independent fragmin60 clones were sequenced entirely. Degenerate primers were designed based on peptide sequences obtained by quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS). A 217-bp cDNA fragment was generated by PCR on the cDNA library using primers 5′-DATRTTRAANGTYTTNCRDATYTCYTC-3′ (EEIRKTFNI) and 5′-CCNACNCCIGAYGARAARGAYG (PTPDEKDE). The primers for walking in the 5′ direction were 5′-CTGTGCGCTTCTCGTCTTTCT-3′ and 5′-AATTCGCGGCCGCGTCGAC-3′ (adaptor primer). Primers for walking in the 3′ direction were 5′-ACTCTTCGAGCTCATCTTGGCTGCTAAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGCCGCGTCGAC-3′ (adaptor primer). The full-length clone was obtained using primers 5′-AATGGGCCGCCGAAGCATCTGCCGGTAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTCTCTTCGCACCACTCATTCTCCTT-3′ (reverse). Both strands were sequenced entirely.

All GST fusion proteins were engineered by PCR using fragmin60 or Skp1 cDNA as template. Briefly, PCR was carried out with a (+) strand primer with a BamHI recognition site and a (−) strand primer with an XbaI recognition site, corresponding to fragmin60, C2-“hinge” region, fragmin60ΔC2, and C2Δ“hinge”, respectively. PCR products were ligated into the pGEX-5X-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). All cDNA constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Skp1 contained an additional C-terminal His6 tag added by PCR. Plasmids were transformed intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS-competent cells (Stratagene). Expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 5 h of growth at 30 °C, cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) with protease inhibitors and lysed by passing the cells twice through a French press. Soluble recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the instructions from the manufacturer and stored frozen at −20 °C. The GST tag was removed from Skp1 with factor Xa. 10 mg of a PS:PC mixture (molar ratio 30:70) in chloroform was dried under a stream of nitrogen, degassed in vacuum overnight, and resuspended in 10 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA) by vigorous vortexing and subsequent sonication (38Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Five μg of various GST-tagged C2 domains in 200 μl of buffer A were mixed with 100 μl of vesicles either in the presence or absence of 3 mm CaCl2 (final concentration free calcium is 1 mm) in a total volume of 300 μl of buffer A. After 5 min of incubation with agitation at 25 °C, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × gfor 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were carefully withdrawn and precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and these pellets as well as lipid-bound complexes were dissolved in 60 μl of SDS sample buffer. A 10-μl sample of both fractions was analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% polyacrylamide gels. GST fusion proteins used in this study were as follows: GST-C2hinge (coding residues 1–165), GST-C2 (residues 1–141), GST-fragmin60ΔC2 (residues 142–536), and GST-fragmin60. GST fusions of C2 domains from other proteins included synaptotagmin I (C2A), II (C2A), VII (C2A), Doc2βC2A, Doc2γC2A, and NEDD4. These were generously provided by Dr. B. Davletov (Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology, Cambridge, UK; SytIIC2A), Dr. D. Rotin, (Departments of Cell/Lung Biology, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; NEDD4C2), Dr. T.

Fukuda (Fukuda Initiative Research Unit, RIKEN, Saitama, Japan; Docβ and Docγ C2A). They were expressed and purified in the same manner as GST-fragmin60 and mutants thereof. Lysates for pull-down assays were prepared from Physarum microplasmodia by disruption in a glass homogenizer in two volumes of buffer B (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm DTT, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche), and 1 mmPMSF), sonication, and centrifugation at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The supernatant was used for the assay. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were preloaded with equivalent amounts (150 μg) of fusion proteins or GST, and mixed with 2 mg of lysate followed by incubation overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 0.6 ml (120 volumes of raisin volume) of lysis buffer, once with TBS buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with silver or Coomassie or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Proteins were detected by ECL using anti-Physarum Skp1 polyclonal antibody or monoclonal anti-His6 and HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody, respectively. The interaction between C2 domains and Skp1 was analyzed as follows: GST-C2 fusion protein (20 μg), immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and varying amounts of recombinant Skp1 were incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBS buffer, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1% bovine serum albumin. Following several washes with the same buffer the samples were boiled in 5× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Skp1 was revealed by Western blotting using monoclonal penta-His antibody (Qiagen). The fragmin60 C2 domain (amino acids 1–165, including the hinge region) and fragmin60 were cloned as BamHI/NotI fragments into the pFastbac donor plasmid, containing an N-terminal His6 tag. Following transformation of the respective plasmids into competent DH10Bac E. coli cells, recombinant bacmid DNA was purified and used to transfect Sf21 insect cells. Recombinant baculovirus particles were harvested and used for infection of HI5 insect cells. Cell lysates were prepared 3 days after infection, and the recombinant proteins were purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the instructions from the manufacturer. HEK293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The fragmin60 C2 domain was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech) at SalI and XhoI sites and PpSkp1 was cloned into pcDNA6Myc/His (Invitrogen) at theEcoRI and XbaI sites, in frame with C-terminal Myc epitope. HEK293T cells were transiently transfected with both plasmids (or pEGFPN1-C2 alone) using calcium phosphate. Next day the medium was renewed, and 48 h after transfection the cells were washed with PBS buffer and treated with 1 mmdithiobis(succinimidylpropionate) (Pierce) for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by adding 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer. After 15 min the cells were lysed in TBS buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor mixture mix (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). The lysate was sonicated and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (20,000 ×g, 10 min at 4 °C). 200 μg of lysate were incubated with either 9E10 monoclonal anti-Myc antibody (kindly provided by Dr. P. Zimmermann, Department of Glycobiology, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) or mouse IgG1. After 1 h, protein G-Sepharose was added. The pellets were washed with lysis buffer and finally analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with either anti-C2 or anti-PpSkp1 antibodies. Microcalorimetric titration measurements were performed in a Microcal Omega isothermal titration calorimeter (Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA). All solutions were degassed under vacuum prior to use. In a typical experiment, 1.33 ml of ∼ 25 μmGST-C2 in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5, was titrated in 28 steps with 300 μl of 600 μmCaCl2 (stock solution obtained from Fluka). During titration, the injection syringe was rotated at 400 rpm. Time between injections was set at 3 min. In a blank experiment, heat evolving from dilution was measured by injecting the CaCl2 solution into the sample cell filled with ∼25 μm GST in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.2 mm DTT, pH 7.5. This heat of dilution was subtracted from the corresponding Ca2+ binding data of the GST-C2 protein. Data were integrated and fitted to an appropriate binding model using ORIGIN software supplied by Microcal Inc. This was performed essentially as described (34Gettemans J., De Ville Y. Waelkens E. Vandekerckhove J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2644-2651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Briefly, actin (8 μm, 25% pyrene-labeled) was polymerized in F-buffer for 15 min. Subsequently the filaments were pre-capped with the actin-fragmin complex (40 nm final concentration). The mixture was stored overnight on ice. This solution was then diluted in G-buffer to a final concentration of 400 nm, which is below the critical monomer concentration of the pointed ends. Addition of a severing protein will create new pointed ends, and the fluorescence will decrease proportionally to the number of free (−) ends. The effect of phospholipids on the severing activity of fragmin60 was investigated by pre-incubating fragmin60 with the indicated phospholipid concentrations for 5 min at room temperature. Subsequently the mixture was added to the pyrene-labeled F-actin solution, and the decrease in fluorescence was measured over time. Pyrenyl G-actin (100% labeled, 140 nm final concentration) was mixed for 10 min with increasing concentrations of fragmin60 (between 0- and 2-fold molar excess over actin) under non-polymerizing conditions. The relative increase in fluorescence was measured for each mixture. These experiments were carried out in the presence of either 0.2 mm Ca2+ or 2 mm EGTA. Mg2+-actin was used for experiments involving EGTA. The GST moiety of purified proteins was removed with factor Xa, and subsequently the proteins were dialyzed overnight against 50 mm NaHCO3 at 4 °C. Samples of 120 μg were concentrated to dryness in a SpeedVac concentrator (Savant Instruments, Farmingdale, NY), and rabbits were immunized (Centre d'Economie Rurale, Laboratoire d'Hormonologie, Marloie, Belgium). Polyclonal antibodies against the C2 domain were affinity-purified on a CNBr-Sepharose-coupled C2 affinity column and eluted with ethanolamine as described in Ref. 34Gettemans J., De Ville Y.

Nitrogen-frozen pellets of plasmodia or sclerotia (2 mg, wet weight) were lysed by mechanical disruption and extracted in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 1 μmokadaic acid, 1 μm staurosporine, and protease inhibitors. Extract (750 μl) was incubated with 20 μl of anti-C2 antibodies or 10 μl of anti-fragminP antibodies (both affinity-purified) overnight at 4 °C in the presence of protein G-Sepharose. Pellets were washed three times with TBS containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, followed by three washes with TBS. Pellets were boiled 5 min in Laemmli sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207159) Google Scholar), and the supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. 10 μl of the supernatants after immunoprecipitation was also electrophoresed on an SDS gel. Protein concentration was measured according to Ref. 41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar using bovine serum albumin as standard. Calculation of free calcium concentrations was done using the MaxChelator program located at www.stanford.edu/∼cpatton/maxc.html. Antibodies were cross-linked to protein G-Sepharose using the SeizeTM X protein G immunoprecipitation kit (Pierce), used according to instructions from the manufacturer. Samples (20 μl) were loaded on a trapping column (inner diameter, 0.8 mm × 2 mm - P/N MGU-80-C18PM, LC-packings) run with solvent A (0.05% (v/v) formic acid in water) at a flow of 10 μl/min. At 5 min after injection, the trapping column was connected in back flush to the separation column (a reversed phase nano-column, inner diameter 0.075 mm × 150 mm; P/N NAN75–15-03-C18PM-MS, LC-Packings). A linear gradient was developed as follows: 5–100% solvent B in 55 min at a flow rate of 60 μl/min (solvent B: 0.04% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile:water (v/v 70:30)). By means of a flow splitter (split ratio 300:1), a flow of about 0.2 μl/min was directed to the separation column. The outlet of the separation column was connected on-line to the electrospray ion source of the mass spectrometer (Z-spray nanosprayer and Q-TOF mass spectrometer, Micromass). The mass spectrometer was controlled with a software package from the manufacturer (Masslynx, version 3.2 b004). Data were acquired in data-dependent mode. In the survey mode, spectra were acquired in the 300–500 m/z range with an integrated scan time of 1 s. In the MS-MS"

The charged α-aminocarboxylate group of glutamate and AMPA and the pyrrolidine carboxyl and imino groups of kainate are accommodated by hydrogen bonds and ion pair interactions with the oppositely charged side chains of Arg-485 and Glu-705, respectively. The distal negatively charged group of the agonists, the carboxylmethyl group of kainate, the γ-carboxylate of glutamate, or the isoxazole ring hydroxyl of AMPA, make close polar contacts with the base of an α-helix (“helix F”) in the lobe 2, but the exact hydrogen bonding patterns differ between agonists (4Armstrong N.

In contrast to the agonist complexes, the ligand-free apo form and one antagonist complex (6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX)) of GluR-B S1S2 assume a more open state, suggesting that agonist activity is based on their ability to induce a slight closure of the lobes (5Armstrong N.

Although the stereochemical features of the agonist-receptor interaction revealed by the crystal structure are largely supported by mutagenesis data, not much is yet known on how the receptor discriminates between agonists and antagonists or on how structurally different antagonists interact with the receptor. In particular, it is currently unclear to what extent the contacts antagonists make with the receptor overlap those made by agonists. Although previous mutagenesis work has identified amino acid residues that affect antagonist affinities in the AMPA receptor, for example Lys-471 and Tyr-472 in GluR-D (9Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), no mutations that would selectively affect only agonists or antagonists have been reported. As a step toward understanding the structural basis of discrimination between agonists and antagonists by AMPA receptors, we have analyzed the ligand binding properties of the mutated GluR-D ligand-binding domain constructs by using [3H]AMPA, an agonist, and [3H]Ro 48-8587, a high affinity AMPA receptor antagonist (10Mutel V.

The results from our ligand binding and molecular docking experiments indicate a selective engagement of the helix F region in agonist binding, suggesting that conformational transitions involving this region are involved in receptor activation.

The PCR products were digested with NcoI and EcoRI and ligated into a similarly treated pK503-4 vector. The presence of all of the designed mutations was verified by DNA sequencing. Recombinant baculoviruses were generated by using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) and used to infect Trichoplusia ni (High Five, Invitrogen) cells growing in T-25 tissue culture flasks as described previously (9Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The cells and culture media were harvested 3–4 days after infection. The culture supernatants were extensively dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 2.5. mm CaCl2, 100 mm KSCN (AMPA binding buffer; see Ref. 12Honoré T. Drejer J. J.

Dialyzed samples (20–100 μl) were equilibrated with [3H]AMPA (5 nm) or [3H]Ro 48-8587 (1 nm) in the respective binding buffers for 1 h on ice in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The bound and free radioactivity were separated by rapid filtration through polyethyleneimine-treated GF/B (Whatman) glass fiber filters. The 3H radioactivity on the filters was measured by liquid scintillation counting in OptiPhase (Wallac). Apparent affinities for AMPA, Ro 48-8587, kainate, glutamate, and DNQX were determined by using competition binding experiments. The radioligand binding data were analyzed by using the GraphPad Prism nonlinear curve-fitting software. For statistical analysis, an unpaired Student's t test was used. The four three-dimensional structures of GluR-B S1S2 complexed with AMPA (Protein Data Bank accession code: 1FTM), (2S-(2α, 3β,4β))-2-carboxy-4-(1-methylethenyl)-3-pyrrolidineacetic acid (kainate; 1ftk) l-glutamate (1FTJ), and DNQX (1FTL) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank (5Armstrong N.

The program HOMODGE in Bodil was used to construct a three-dimensional model structure by keeping the side-chain conformations of all identical residues fixed and by maintaining the corresponding torsion angles of similar aligned residues. Ligands were built with the program Sybyl 6.6 (Tripos, St. Louis, MO). Each ligand structure was energy-minimized prior to docking to the receptor models using the Tripos force field and conjugate gradient method until the energy gradient was less than 0.05 kcal/mol. Protonation of polar groups was checked by comparison of the final three-dimensional structures with similar substructures obtained from the Cambridge Structural Data Bank (29Allen F.H. Kennard O. Chem. Des. Automation News. 1993; 8: 31-37Google Scholar). Polar hydrogens were added to the receptor models using SYBYL. To optimize the intramolecular interactions in the receptor models, hydrogen atoms were minimized (keeping the rest of the model rigid) using AMBER charges. AUTODOCK 3.0 (16Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S.

The overall interaction energy between chemical species is estimated by considering both Lennard-Jones atom-atom potentials and electrostatic effects, summed for the individual interactions between atoms. Partial charges for the receptor model were calculated using the AMBER force field (17Cornell W.D. Cieplak P. Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz Jr., K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T Caldwell J.W.

Des. 1990; 4: 1-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (2792) Google Scholar) from the MOPAC package within SYBYL was used. This semiempirical method considers only the valence-shell electrons explicitly. The interaction of a probe group (corresponding to each type of atom in the ligand) with a receptor model was calculated, using the program AUTOGRID in the AUTODOCK package, at grid position 0.25 Å apart in a 20 × 20 × 20 Å3 box centered at the binding site. For each ligand, 10 separate docking simulations were performed. Atomic and chemical group affinity maps in the binding site were calculated with GRID 19 (20). This program evaluates interaction energies between various test probes and the target protein molecule, predicting where a particular chemical probe interacts most favorably within the receptor-binding site. For the calculation, a cubic box (15 × 15 × 15) Å3was centered in the binding site, and residue side-chain flexibility was allowed. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as described previously (3Kuusinen A. Arvola M. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6327-6332Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 9Lampinen M. Pentikäinen O. Johnson M.S. Keinänen K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4704-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured by using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. The N-terminal end of an α-helix (helix F) and the preceding residues in the S2 segment of the ligand-binding domain of the AMPA receptor form a major region of contact for the distal anionic group of agonists (subsites D, E, and F in the crystal structure of GluR-B S1S2-agonist complexes; see Ref. 5Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used site-directed mutagenesis and direct binding experiments with radiolabeled agonist and antagonist compounds to further examine the role of this region in ligand recognition. Mutated GluR-D S1S2 constructs having an alanine substituting individually for residues from Leu-672 to Lys-678 were expressed in recombinant baculovirus-infected High Five cells and appeared as a 40–42-kDa anti-FLAG immunoreactive species in the culture supernatants (Fig.1). Comparison of secreted and cell-associated immunoreactivities revealed no major differences in the expression levels or in the relative amount of secreted protein, suggesting that the mutations do not cause any gross misfolding of the respective S1S2 proteins (Fig. 1 B). The relative amounts of the 42-kDa- and 40-kDa- secreted species, probably representing two differently glycosylated forms, were variable but did not show any consistent differences between the mutant and the wild-type polypeptide. To separately address the agonist and antagonist binding properties of the mutated S1S2 proteins, we used [3H]AMPA, a high affinity agonist, and [3H]Ro 48-8587, a recently described high affinity competitive AMPA receptor antagonist (10Mutel V. Trube G. Klingelschmidt A. Messer J. Bleuel Z. Humbel U. Clifford M.M. Ellis G.J. Richards J.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as radioligands. First, the ability of the S1S2 mutants to bind [3H]AMPA was determined in a qualitative binding assay using a single 100 nm concentration, which is saturating for the wild-type S1S2. Clear binding activity was observed for the mutants D673A, S674A, S676A, and K678A, whereas no binding above the nonspecific background measured in the presence of 1 mmglutamate was observed for the mutants L672A, G675A, and T677A (Fig.2). The [3H]AMPA binding properties of the four active mutants were analyzed in more detail by using competition experiments with unlabeled AMPA andl-glutamate. The apparent affinities for AMPA (D673A, S676A, K678A) or glutamate (S674A, K678A) were found to be slightly decreased (Table I).Table I[3H]AMPA binding properties of GluR-D S1S2 mutantsConstructK dAMPAK il-GlunmμmS1S224.8 ± 3.65 (n = 3)0.279 ± 0.365 (n = 3)L672ANB–D673A65.1 ± 18.8* (n = 4)1.870 ± 0.369** (n = 3)S674A32.6 ± 3.78* (n = 4)NDG675ANB–S676A92.6 ± 24.1** (n = 4)0.596 ± 0.181* (n = 4)T677ANB–K678A103 ± 20.8** (n = 3)0.840 ± 0.124** (n = 3)Apparent binding affinities are indicated as K d andK i values obtained from radioligand displacement experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Next, we employed [3H]-labeled Ro 48-8587 to directly determine the ligand binding properties of the mutants irrespective of their [3H]AMPA binding activity. In a filtration binding assay, [3H]Ro 48-8587 bound to GluR-D S1S2 with high affinity (K i 15.6 nm; Fig.3, Table II), in agreement with nanomolar binding affinity reported for rat brain membranes (10Mutel V. Trube G. Klingelschmidt A. Messer J. Bleuel Z. Humbel U. Clifford M.M. Ellis G.J. Richards J.G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expectedly, the binding was displaced by unlabeled glutamate (K i 1.25 μm), kainate (K i 3.72 μm), and DNQX (K i 0.20 μm) (Fig. 3, Table II). In contrast to [3H]AMPA binding, all seven alanine substitution mutants bound [3H]Ro 48-8587 with similar high affinity (K i values for Ro 48-8587 ranging from 9.5 to 26 nm but did not differ from the wild-type value in a statistically significant manner (Table II). The relatively intact antagonist binding was not unique to Ro 48-8587, as another antagonist of a different structural type, DNQX, also inhibited [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to the mutated S1S2 constructs displaying closely similar K i values for the wild-type and mutants (ranging from 0.11 to 0.32 μm; Table II). Glutamate inhibited [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to the wild-type and most of the mutated S1S2 proteins with aK i value in the low micromolar range except for two of the non-AMPA-binding mutants, L672A (K i for glutamate 97 μm; 78-fold decrease in affinity) and T677A (K i 4.8 mm; 3840-fold decrease). Interestingly, the G675A mutant, which did not bind [3H]AMPA, displayed a similar K i value for glutamate as the wild-type S1S2 (Table II). Kainate inhibited [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to all S1S2 proteins at micromolar concentrations. Significantly reduced affinities were observed with the L672A (26-fold) and T677A (13-fold) mutants, whereas somewhat smaller affinity decreases were seen with the G675A and K678A mutations (TableII).Table II[3H]Ro 48–8587 binding properties of GluR-D S1S2 mutantsConstructK d Ro 48–8587K i AMPAK il-GluK ikainateK i DNQXnmμmμmμmμmS1S215.6 ± 6.560.027 ± 0.0051.25 ± 0.6273.72 ± 1.070.200 ± 0.091L672A20.1 ± 5.8947.4 ± 6.4297.3 ± 14.0***95.2 ± 29.9**0.136 ± 0.037D673A9.53 ± 2.31ND2.55 ± 1.491.63 ± 0.20*0.282 ± 0.146S674A23.8 ± 3.45ND1.02 ± 0.072.36 ± 0.3380.218 ± 0.033G675A18.4 ± 6.925.98 ± 2.981.33 ± 0.40422.5 ± 8.21**0.214 ± 0.163S676A26.1 ± 9.98ND3.49 ± 1.07***4.49 ± 1.570.323aThe value is from a single experiment.T677A13.8 ± 1.45230aThe value is from a single experiment.4800 ± 1400***49.2 ± 6.22***0.112 ± 0.029K678A14.6 ± 0.473ND2.14 ± 0.4419.05 ± 2.64**0.169 ± 0.017Apparent binding affinities are indicated as K d orK i values obtained from radioligand displacement experiments (see “Experimental Procedures”).

In additional experiments, the ability of unlabeled AMPA to displace [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to the “AMPA-negative” S1S2 mutants was determined. L672A, G675A, and T677A mutant S1S2 polypeptides were tested. In all three cases, severe, ∼2000-fold (L672A), ∼300-fold (G675A), and ∼11,000-fold decreases in the binding affinity were observed (Table II), consistent with the failure to see any [3H]AMPA binding activity in the filtration assay. Thus, mutations in the helix F region seem to selectively affect agonist affinities in an agonist-specific manner, with little or no effect on the binding of two different competitive antagonists. This striking behavior is illustrated in Fig. 3, which shows the inhibition of [3H]Ro 48-8587 binding to L672A, G675A, and T677A by unlabeled agonist and antagonist compounds. These findings suggest that in contrast to AMPA receptor agonists, neither DNQX nor Ro 48-8587 does interact with the side chains of residues 672–678. Molecular modeling was used to interpret the ligand binding data in terms of the three-dimensional structure of the receptor. Four models of GluR-D S1S2, differing in the degree of domain closure, were built on the basis of the GluR-B S1S2 structures with bound l-glutamate, AMPA, kainate, and DNQX (5Armstrong N. Gouaux E. Neuron. 2000; 28: 165-181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The sequence identity between GluR-D and GluR-B over the S1S2 region is 89.6% with only one difference near the binding site: a phenylalanine residue (Phe-724) in GluR-D replaces a tyrosine residue in GluR-B. AMPA,l-glutamate, and kainate were automatically docked to the respective GluR-D S1S2 model structures (Fig.4, A–C). The modeled conformations of these ligands are close to those derived from the corresponding crystal structures: the root mean squared deviations over all ligand atoms between the GluR-D model and the structures of GluR-B S1S2 complexes with AMPA, l-glutamate, and kainate were 0.51, 0.64, and 0.60, respectively. Alanine substitutions at three positions, residues Leu-672, Gly-675, and Thr-677, resulted in clear changes in agonist binding, whereas similar mutations of Asp-673, Ser-674, Ser-676, and Lys-678 had only minor effects (Tables I and II). Generally, we found these findings to be in good agreement with the model. Three (Asp-673, Ser-674, and Lys-678) of the four residues that show no gross alterations when mutated do not have any contacts with the agonists. The side chains of Asp-673, Ser-674, and Lys-678 point away from the binding cavity, but a salt bridge with a local stabilizing effect may form between Asp-673 and Lys-678. Such an indirect role is in agreement with the observed, relatively minor affinity changes when these residues were mutated. The main chain amide nitrogens of Ser-676 and Thr-677 carry a partial positive charge due to their location at the N terminus of the helix F dipole and are hydrogen-bonded to the distal anionic group of the agonists. The side chain of Ser-676, however, does not have a direct contact with any of the agonists. Instead, its hydroxyl group is linked via a water bridge (Fig. 4 D, w2) to Glu-727 in GluR-D, perhaps explaining the modest decreases in the binding affinities of agonists caused by the S676A mutation (Tables Iand II). Replacement of Leu-672 by alanine resulted in a total loss of [3H]AMPA binding and dramatically lowered the affinities of glutamate and kainate when measured in the [3H]Ro 48-8587 competition binding assay (Table II). In the GluR-B S1S2 structures with bound agonist, the corresponding residue, Leu-650, is found in two different conformations: one present in the AMPA and glutamate complexes and the other one observed in the kainate complex. We suggest that the latter conformation is likely to be relevant for Leu-672 in GluR-D in all three agonist complexes. This conformation of Leu-672 will ideally pack against the aromatic ring of Phe-727 (which substitutes for Tyr-702 in GluR-B), resulting in slightly better contact with the hydrophobic parts of the agonist ligands (Figs. 4,A–C, and 5). In the case of AMPA, the total loss of binding with the L672A mutation is in agreement with extensive hydrophobic contacts between leucine and both the methylene group and the aromatic/hydrophobic part of the isoxazol ring of AMPA (Fig. 4 A). Furthermore, the considerable extra space created by the alanine substitution is not easily accommodated by side-chain rearrangements and would provide a less than ideal location for a water molecule. Similarly, the impaired binding affinity ofl-glutamate for the L672A mutant is consistent with a total or partial loss of hydrophobic contacts with the two methylene groups of the agonist. Interestingly, the bulky isopropenyl group of kainate is predicted to interact favorably with an alanine side chain at position 672, in agreement with the observed moderate (26-fold) decrease in binding affinity with L672A (Table II). The effects of the alanine substitution at residue Gly-675 were remarkably specific for AMPA binding: despite the total loss of [3H]AM"

Immunol. 1990; 144: 1030-1036Google Scholar), contain almost exclusively 1-alkyl-2-acylinositol phospholipid, which appear to be characteristic of human anchors in general (6Ratnoff W.D. Knez J.J. Prince G.M. Okada H. Lachman P.J. Medof M.E. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1992; 87: 415-421Google Scholar). In addition, some GPI anchors contain an additional fatty acid (palmitate) in a hydroxyester linkage to the inositol ring, which renders them resistant to the action of bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) and the GPI-specific phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) fromTrypanosoma brucei. The basis of this phospholipase resistance was first described for human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (7Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Google Scholar), and subsequently for human erythrocyte decay-accelerating factor (5Walter E.I. Roberts W.L. Rosenberry T.L. Ratnoff W.D. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1030-1036Google Scholar). The presence of a substitution on the 2-position of the inositol ring would explain the PI-PLC resistance of the palmitoylated anchors since the bacterial PLC enzyme operates via nucleophilic attack of the phosphorus atom by the hydroxyl group at the 2-position of the inositol ring. This finding led to the suggestion that occupation of the myo-inositol 2-position hydroxy group by palmitate would automatically preclude the action of this enzyme (8Ferguson M.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 297-300Google Scholar). As shown for DAF and some other GPI-linked proteins they can exhibit differential inositol acetylation, and this structural variation is regulated in a cell-specific fashion, but can also be protein-dependent (9Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfried S. Medof M.E. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Google Scholar). The biological relevance of GPI anchor structural variability among different blood cell types remains incompletely understood. The presence of additional fatty acid chain (acylation) in the hydrophobic domain probably improves the attachment of the molecule to the external leaflet of the membrane. The presence of this acyl-chain on the inositol ring in erythrocyte-associated anchors renders these structures resistant to cleavage by PI-PLC and less sensitive to PI-PLD cleavage when purified. The resistance to be released by phospholipases, either by blocking the lytic mechanism of a phosphatidyl-specific phospholipase C or by retaining membrane association following cleavage of phosphatidic acid by anchor-specific phospholipase D, may enhance the membrane stability of these proteins over time, consistent with the longer (120 day) life span in the circulation of erythrocytes as compared with leukocytes. We report here on a novel GPI-linked erythrocyte membrane protein with an anchor sensitive to phospholipases C and unusual structure of the lipid portion of protein, distinct from that of other erythrocyte (DAF, LFA, MIRL, and acetylcholinesterase) proteins. Human blood withdrawn from healthy donor was centrifuged at 1500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Plasma and buffy coat were removed by aspiration, and packed cells were washed twice in 150 mm/15 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.6) and lysed in CH3COOH/distilled water. Membranes were pelleted at 10,000 × g for 15 min and washed with extraction buffer, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose. This step was repeated until the ghosts showed no visual evidence of residual hemoglobin. (Three washes were usually required). After the last wash, the ghosts were resuspended in the same buffer. The pellet was frozen in fluid nitrogen for 15 min and thawed at 25 °C. This procedure was repeated three times. The homogenate was then adjusted to 400 mmwith respect to KCl and centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant was collected and adjusted to 70% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 (Sigma) and stirred for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were collected by centrifugation, redissolved in the extraction buffer, and precipitated again with 40% saturation with (NH4)2SO4 (see Fig. 2 A). The precipitated proteins were stirred again for 30 min on ice, redissolved in extraction buffer, and dialyzed against storage buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose), and stored at −20 °C. The pure amphiphilic form of protein was obtained by further preparative steps including SDS-gel electrophoresis. The gel bands of the protein were excised and crushed in 25 mmTris-base, 192 mm glycine, and 0.035% SDS (pH 8.3), and the supernatant was collected after overnight incubation at 4 °C. Purified protein was dialyzed against the storage buffer (NH4)2CO3, precipitated with ice cold acetone in ethanol/dry ice bath, and stored at 4 °C. The protein concentrations were measured by the methods of Bradford (10Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed on a linear gradient gel of 4–15% polyacrylamide in the discontinuous buffer of Laemmli (11Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). The samples were boiled for 2 min in the reducing sample buffer before electrophoresis. Protein bands were identified by silver staining or negative staining by CuCl2. Molecular weights were estimated by comparison with the position of molecular weight standards purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (München, Germany). Gels were fixed with methanol/acetic acid or ethanol/acetic acid and visualized with Coomassie Blue or by standard silver staining. A total of 1–5 ng of protein proband was subjected to PhastGel isoelectrical focusing (IEF) gradient media supplied by Amersham Biosciences. The samples are applied ∼10 mm from a cathode. Additional controls were done applying samples next to an anode and a cathode. The bands were visualized using the silver staining method according to manufacturer's instruction. For standards, the Amersham Biosciences Broad pI Calibration KIT on PhastGel IEF 3–9 was used. Chemical deglycosylation was performed to prepare ACA protein for primary structural analysis. A protein sample free of salts, metal ions, and detergents was treated with anhydrous trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (Oxford GlycoScience, UK) for 4.5 h in a freezer, neutralized, and recovered in 0.5% ammonium bicarbonate. The neutralized reaction mixture was then dialyzed against the same buffer, and precipitated deglycosylated protein isolated directly by centrifugation. Chemically deglycosylated protein was treated with trypsin or Asp-N at 37 °C for 18 h. Peptides were separated by C18 reverse phase-high pressure liquid chromatography. N-terminal sequences were determined by automated Edman degradation using gas phase sequencer. Subsequently, a search in the human sequence data bank was performed (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov./entrez/query.Fcgi?db = protein). Preparation of ghosts was done according to protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board of the New York Blood Center. Briefly, about 2.3 × 106/ml packed red cells and erythroleukemia cells (K-562) were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline buffer at 5000 rpm for 5 min. After the supernatant was decanted, the cells were lysed with 1:20.5 dilution of phosphate-buffered saline in distilled water and centrifuge at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was decanted, and the discrete pellet of the white cells adhering to the centrifuge tube was removed, too (12Dodge J.T. Mitchell C. Hanahan D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1963; 100: 119-130Google Scholar). Resuspended ghosts were washed with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) until they became white and fluffy. Equal volume of simple buffer was added and boiled for 2 min before subjected to SDS-PAGE using 4.5 stacking gel and 4–15% separating gel. Membrane proteins (10–30 μg) prepared from the erythrocyte ghosts and homogenized tissue of erythroleukemia (K-652) cells were mixed with reducing sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The filters were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and used for testing antibody reactivity. Polyclonal mouse serum against a 65-kDa GPI-protein was used at a dilution of 1:5000. Visualization was performed using anti-IgG secondary antibody and conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium as a chromogenic substrate for alkaline phosphatase (Promega). Digestion with glycosyl phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase C (GPI-PLC) from Trypanosoma brucei (Oxford GlycoScience) was performed for 1 h at 30 °C. Samples of proteins were further buffered by addition of TBS (Tris-buffered saline, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 mNaCl, containing 0.1% of Triton X-114, 10 mm1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 5 mm EDTA) and incubated with 5 μl (25 units/ml) of enzyme. Incubation with 5 milliunits of PI-PLC (Bacillus cereus, Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were performed in triethanolamine buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, 10 mm EDTA, and 10 mm sodium azide, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37 °C. Digestion with anchor-specific phospholipase D (from bovine serum EC3.1.4.50 Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, Triton X-100 0.008% (w/vol.) for 60 min at 37 °C. After the reactions were finished, 10 μl of reducing sample buffer was added. Tubes containing the reaction mixtures were placed in a boiling water bath for 5 min, and aliquots of the samples were subsequently subjected to analysis by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (PhastGel System fromAmersham Biosciences). The GPI-PLC-, PI-PLC-, and GPI-PLD-cleaved proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. After blocking, the antigens were visualized with affinity-purified anti-CRD antibody (GlycoScience, Oxford). After washing, bound anti-CRD was detected by incubation with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and visualized with streptavidin horseradish peroxidase. As positive and negative controls, the soluble form of variant surface glycoprotein and the membrane form of ACA were blotted simultaneously and revealed with anti-CRD antibody. Purified ACA protein was digested with PI- and GPI-phospholipases C and subjected to further hydrolysis with triacylglycerol acyl hydrolase (300 units) (Rhizopus arrhizus EC 3.1.1.1, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by carboxylic ester hydrolase (30 units) (from pig liver EC 3.1.1.1., Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in reaction buffer containing 0.1 mg of SDS/ml for 25 min at 25 °C. Glycerol is determined as described by purchaser (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with glycerokinase (GK) pyruvate kinase (PK), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as auxiliary and indicatory enzymes (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Lipase, esterase, PK, LDH, and GK were free from hexokinase, as well as other interfering kinases and phosphatases; ATP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was substantially free from ADP and P-enolpyruvate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) from pyruvate. The decrease in the extinction at 340, 334, and 365 nm due to oxidation of NADH was measured (Fig.1). Purified proteins were labeled with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine) ([125I]TID) (Amersham Biosciences) by photolysis at 350 nm for 15 min as described by Roberts and Rosenberry (13Roberts W.L. Rosenberry T.L. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3091-3098Google Scholar). A 10-μl aliquot of [125I]TID in ethanol (5–200 μCi) was added to 500 μl of buffered red blood cells ACA protein in a 1 cm2-rubber-stoppered borosilicate glass test tube and agitated gently to ensure complete mixing. Photolysis was performed for 20 min in a Beckman spectrophotometer with the slits removed. Samples of GPI-PLC and PI-PLC cleaved [125I]-TID-labeled proteins were subjected to further hydrolysis with triacyl glycero-protein acylhydrolase followed by carboxylic-ester hydrolase, and the lipid products of this reaction were extracted with chloroform/methanol/HCl (22:50:1) and centrifuged for 15 min at 300 × g. The lower phase was removed and evaporated to dryness under nitrogen. The residues were resolved in 0.1 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1), and these solutions were quantitatively applied to TLC plates. Thin-layer chromatography was performed on 10 × 20-cm Silica Gel plates (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) without activation. Development was either with solvent B (hexane/diethylether/acetic acid (60:30:1)) or solvent A (hexane/2-propanol, (96:4)). The positions of radioactive components were identified by autoradiography with Kodak XAR-5 film. The positions of standards were located by exposure of dried plates to iodine vapor. Homogeneously purified 65-kDa GPI-protein in complete Freund's adjuvant was used for immunization of 6 BALB/c mice. After 4 weeks the mice were boosted, and a week later the mice were test-bled. The mice with the highest titers of anti-ACA activity in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening assays were used for antiserum production and later on, after additional boosting, for the production of monoclonal antibodies. A two-step purification procedure was applied for the preparation of the protein. The first step includes the disruption of the hemoglobin-free membrane followed by repeated precipitation with ammonium sulfate of various saturation grades and preparative electrophoresis (Fig.2 A). The purity of preparations was evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2, A andB) and IEF, (Fig. 3,A and B). Preparations were obtained from various batches of pooled human erythrocytes. No degradation products were identified in any preparation. Purified and chemically deglycosylated ACA was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing. No sequence was obtained, indicating a blocked N terminus. Therefore, the protein was inactivated and trypsinized, and sequence was established for 11 internal peptides (Fig.4). Only peptide A shows homology with the 1230–1246 region of the α-chain of human erythrocyte spectrin (14Sahr K.E. Laurila P. Kotula L. Scarpa A.L. Coupal E. Leto T.L. Linnenbach A.J. Winkelmann J.C. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. Curtis P.J. Forget B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 256: 4434-4443Google Scholar). We further focused our attention on the biochemical characterization of this protein, particularly of its lipid portion, and compared it with some other GPI-linked molecules expressed on the surface of human erythrocytes. The susceptibility of a protein to release from a membrane surface by bacterial PI-PLC is the original indicator for the presence of a GPI anchor. However, some GPI anchors are resistant to hydrolysis by bacterial PI-PLC, such as erythrocyte membrane proteins, and this resistance depends on additional acylations on the inositol ring (15Low M.G. Stiernberg J. Waneck G.L. Flavell R.A. Kinkade P.W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 113: 101-111Google Scholar). To investigate whether this protein is anchored in the membrane bilayer by covalent attachment of the C-terminal amino acid residue to a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol, we studied the specific hydrolysis of the phosphodiester bond of phosphatidylinositol with different anchor-degrading enzymes. We first observed that the effect of PI-PLC on the erythrocyte membrane protein fraction led to a disappearance of a very faint electrophoretical band, which was later identified as our new human erythrocyte protein. Because of the very low abundance of this protein on the surface of erythrocytes, we further characterized the lipid portion of this molecule on the purified protein. Phospholipases C hydrolyzes the phosphodiester linkage to produce 1,2-diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol and the phosphorylated polar head group, while the phospholipases D hydrolyzes the phosphodiester linkage to produce a phosphorylated 1,2-diacylglycerol or alkylacylglycerol and the polar head group with an exposed hydroxyl group. As shown in Fig.5 A, there was no portion of the ACA protein that remained resistant to anchor-degrading phospholipases. The native, intact protein exhibits slow migration, indicative of detergent micellar association. The PI and GPI-PLC hydrolyzed protein of red blood cells ACA exhibited more rapid migration, characteristic of a detergent-free hydrophilic species. The ACA protein treated with glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol phospholipase D shows no changes in electrophoretic mobility when compared with the native protein (Fig. 5 B). The lower electrophoretic mobility of GPI-PLD-digested protein, when compared with the PI-PLC digested one, is due to the lack of a phosphate (negative charge) on the inositol ring of the degraded protein. A polyclonal antibody raised to soluble VSG cross-reacts with other unrelated GPI-anchored proteins. This CRD is only exposed when the protein is converted into a hydrophilic form by the action of either bacterial PI-PLC or eukaryotic GPI-PLC. In the case of the soluble form of variant surface glycoprotein, three overlapping epitopes are involved in this recognition: the inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate generated on phospholipase C cleavage of the anchor, the non-acetylated glucosamine residue, and the variable galactose branch. It is also known that regarding mammalian proteins the major epitope involved in this recognition is the inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate (16Cardoso de Almeida M.L. Turner M.L. Nature. 1983; 302: 349-352Google Scholar). Thus, the recognition of a protein following phospholipase C cleavage by an anti-CRD antibody is the most powerful evidence for the presence of a GPI anchor. In the next set of experiments we sought to determine whether anti-CRD antibodies recognized a soluble form of isolated ACA protein. As demonstrate here, human erythrocytes ACA exhibit >99% PI-PLC sensitivity to the action of phospholipases C. Glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C-digested protein was electrophoresed and then subjected to Western blotting using anti-CRD antibody (Fig. 6). As positive control, the membrane form of variant surface glycoprotein (mVSG) was digested with the same anchor-degrading phospholipases. As negative control, the native form of ACA and GPI-PLD-cleaved protein were blotted simultaneously and labeled with anti-CRD antibody. The GPI-PLD-cleaved molecules do not react with anti-CRD antibodies indicating that this enzyme leaves phosphodiacylglycerol and 1,6-myo-inositol as reaction products, destroying the CRD antigenic determinant by preventing the formation of d-myo-inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate. The membrane form of ACA was also used as a negative control; as expected, it was not recognized by anti-CRD antibodies. PI- and GPI-PLC-digested purified protein was further hydrolyzed with triacylglycerol acyl-hydrolyze, giving the 1,2-diglyceride and fatty acid as first reaction products followed by carboxylic ester hydrolase, an enzyme that accelerates the total hydrolysis by a specific cleavage of soluble glyceride, leaving glycerol and fatty acids as the final reaction products (17Wieland O.H. Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VI. Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1984: 504-510Google Scholar). Glycerol was then determined enzymatically with GK, PK, and LDH as auxiliary and indicatory enzymes. The scheme of all enzymatic reactions leading to total hydrolysis of the lipid tail of the ACA anchor and enzymatic reactions for determinations of glycerol are outlined in Fig. 1. The decrease in extinction at 340, 334, and 365 nm due to oxidation of NADH is measured, and released glycerol calculated in g/liter. The amounts of released glycerol by hydrolysis with PI and GPI-phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases followed by specific deacetylation were similar, indicating the same specific activity of both enzymes on ACA. (TableI). To further investigate the structure of the hydrophobic domain in red blood cells ACA, particularly the fatty acids composition, we analyzed the fragments generated by total hydrolysis of the anchor. We used the photo-activated reagent [125I]TID, which was shown to partition strongly in favor of the lipid phase of membranes. The photogenerated carbene labels the lipid groups of intrinsic membrane proteins in a highly selective manner. Samples of [125I]TID-labeled, purified proteins were subjected to hydrolysis with GPI-phospholipase C. The lipid products of these reactions were further hydrolyzed with highly specific lipases, triacylglycerol acylhydrolase, and carboxylic-ester hydrolyze as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The released radiolabeled fragments were extracted and analyzed by thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. The membrane form of variant surface glycoprotein from T. brucei was [125I]TID-labeled and hydrolyzed in the same manner as ACA and subjected to thin-layer chromatography as a control (Fig.7).Table IDetermination of glycerol concentrationRelease of glycerolPI-PLCGPI-PLC65 kDa0.045 g/liter0.038 g/literData show the amount of released glycerol after total hydrolysis ofACA lipid tail. Open table in a new tab Data show the amount of released glycerol after total hydrolysis ofACA lipid tail. The major lipid species obtained by total hydrolysis of anchor of ACA exhibited the same mobility as labeled fatty acid tail of commercially available VSG, indicating the same 1,2-diacyl myristate structure. This structure differs from other erythrocyte GPI-linked proteins, which have alkyl-acyl glycerol and different fatty acids as a lipid tail of a molecule. We established a purification method to obtain large amounts of protein necessary for immunization of 6 BALB/c mice according to standard procedures. To improve our understanding of this novel molecule, we first produced a mouse polyclonal antibody and tested its specificity with different samples of crude protein extract, purified protein, red cell membrane, and cell-free extracts. The specificity of the polyclonal antibody was tested in Western blots with various protein fractions. Ammonium sulfate protein extract obtained from erythrocyte membranes as described under “Experimental Procedures” was dissolved in storage buffer dialyzed against the same buffer and subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE. The homogeneously purified ACA protein and protein extracts obtained from erythrocyte ghosts and ghosts obtained from human erythroleukemia cell line (K-562) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The polyclonal mouse serum specifically reacted with the 65-kDa band corresponding to ACA protein (Fig. 8). No reaction with other proteins was observed. The faint band of erythrocyte crude protein extract shows a high specificity of antibody to this novel antigen and a very low abundance of this molecule in the plasma membrane of red blood cells compared with human blood malignant cells. We describe here the isolation and purification up to homogeneity of a novel human erythrocyte membrane protein called ACA. The protein was identified first, on SDS-PAGE as a faint band of ∼65 kDa in a protein fraction obtained from erythrocyte ghosts. After the protein extract was treated with PI-PLC the faint band disappeared, indicating the existence of an anchor on this protein. For purification of this protein of unknown function, a classical protein chemical method was established. For further characterization of this protein, we provide two lines of evidence. The first line of evidence indicates the homogeneous protein preparation with an isoelectrical point at pH 5.5 and molecular mass of 65,000 Daltons. Mouse polyclonal antiserum raised against the purified protein specifically recognizes a protein with the same molecular mass in various protein and cell-free extracts. The second line of evidence indicates that erythrocyte ACA anchor structure differs from that of other GPI-linked erythrocyte membrane proteins. The ability of bacterial PI-PLC to release proteins attached to the membrane has permitted the identification of several phosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (18Toutant J.P. Richards M.K. Drall J.A. Rosenberry T.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 187: 31-38Google Scholar). PI-PLC and GPI-PLC treatment of ACA extracted from red blood cells results in a shift in the electrophoretical gel indicating a phosphoinositol structure on this protein. As judged from the gel, the whole amount of the protein was hydrolyzed, indicating that the anchor of the protein exists on the surface of the erythrocyte membrane exclusively in a non-acetylated form, which means that the myo-inositol 2-position hydroxy group is not additionally acetylated in ACA molecule. Additional evidence supporting this lipid structure of ACA was provided by immunoblotting with anti-CRD antibody including appropriate controls. In immunoblot analysis, purified anti-CRD antibody recognizes the phospholipase-solubilized form of ACA. The protein was recognized by anti-CRD antibody after PI-PLC digestion because this antibody reacts to a large extent with the inositol 1,2-cyclic phosphate epitope generated after PI-PLC cleavage. The treatment with GPI-PLD, however, results in the complete loss of this epitope due to inositol-1,2-cyclic-phosphate removal. Phospholipase D degraded a lipid anchor other than phospholipase C by leaving phospholipid as final reaction product. Furthermore, the anti-CRD antibody also failed to recognize the membrane form of ACA protein, indicating the specificity of the reaction. Specific hydrolysis of the lipid tail of the anchor provides evidence for the diacyl nature of glycerol binding. The first enzyme, triacylglycerol-acylhydrolase from Rhizopus arrhizus, belongs to that group of esterases that hydrolyze substrates quantitatively to glycerol and fatty acids, especially the α and α′-esters of glycerol and long chain fatty acids. Carboxylic ester hydrolysis, with its high specificity to monoglycerides, was facilitating the total hydrolysis of the anchor. Glycerol was a final product of these reactions, and its amount was determined according to standard procedure (17Wieland O.H. Bergmeyer H.U. 3rd Ed. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VI. Verlag Chemie, Deerfield Beach, FL1984: 504-510Google Scholar). The amounts of glycerol released from ACA by enzymatic deacetylation with bacterial and eukaryotic phospholipases was similar in both cases, but bacterial PI-phospholipase C seemed to be more active than eukaryotic GPI-phospholipase. In this paper, we documented that [125I]TID specifically labels the hydrophobic domain of ACA. After total lipid hydrolysis, extraction of fatty acids, and analysis on silica thin-layer chromatography exclusively myristic acid was found. All these data provide a strong evidence that ACA protein has an anchor based on diacyl-myristate, a structure very similar to that of mVSG of T. brucei.Previous characterizations of different GPI-anchored proteins on the surface of erythrocytes such as DAF, CD59, LFA-3, and AchE, have shown that these proteins exhibit differential inositol acylation, a structural variation regulated in a cell-specific fashion (5Walter E.I. Roberts W.L. Rosenberry T.L. Ratnoff W.D. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 1030-1036Google Scholar). It seems that the precursor pools for both PLC-sensitive and PLC-resistant anchors exist in a number of cells and that the proportion of attached glycolipid anchors arising from these two pools is both tissue and protein specific (7Roberts W.L. Myher J.J. Kuksis A. Low M.G. Rosenberry T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18766-18775Google Scholar, 9Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfried S. Medof M.E. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Google Scholar). It has recently been shown (9Chen R. Walter E.I. Parker G. Lapurga J.P. Millan J.L. Ikehara Y. Udenfried S. Medof M.E. Proc, Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9512-9517Google Scholar) that inositol acylation in mature surface proteins is regulated via posttransfer deacylation, occurring in endoplasmic reticulum immediately after GPI transfer, which in general is cell-specific but also can be protein-dependent. The structural feature of phospholipids of all these erythrocyte GPI-linked proteins is based on 1-alkyl,2-acyl-glycerol in contrast to unacetylated dimyristoylphosphatidylinositol, which is uniformly present in trypanosome membrane from variant surface glycoproteins. This first comparison of GPI anchors from different proteins expressed in the same tissue suggests that human reticulocytes produce only one type of anchor structure (19Rudd P.M. Morgan B.P. Wormald M.R. Harvey D.J. van den Berg C.W. Davies S.J. Ferguson M.A.J. Dwek R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7229-7244Google Scholar), and furthermore also GPI-anchored proteins from other cell types seem to have exclusively alkyl-acylglycerol as a lipid backbone (20Singh N. Liang L. Tykocinski M. Tartakoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12879-12884Google Scholar). The experiments described in this study provide evidence that ACAs GPI anchor phospholipid head group differs from that of known erythrocytes GPI-linked proteins like DAF, acetylcholinesterase, and MIRL. The anchor we describe here consists principally of the minimum core glycan sequence Manα1–2-Manα1–6-Manα1–4-GlcN-linked to a phosphatidyl-moiety with the structure sn-1-O-acyl-2-O-acylglycerol-3-phospho-myo-inositol. This structure is essentially identical to dimyristoylphosphatidylinositol, which is uniformly present inTrypanosoma mVSG, the first protein in which GPI anchors were chemically characterized (21Ferguson M.A.J. Cross G.A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3011-3015Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of whole protein extract, purified ACA, and ghosts prepared from red blood cells and cells from erythroleukemia (K-562) with polyclonal anti-mouse antibody confirm the specificity of antibody. Moreover the same analysis indicates a very low abundance of this molecule in the membrane of red blood cells and apparently much higher expression in malignant cells. Sequence analysis of 11 peptides obtained from ACA by trypsin digestion showed no homology with protein sequences of the data bank except for peptide A (Fig. 4), which exhibited partial identity with the 1230–1246 region of human erythrocyte spectrin. Search in the human sequence data bank was not successful; therefore, we concluded that the ACA sequence is not contained in the Human Genome data base. We report here for the first time the existence of a novel erythrocyte GPI-phospholipase C-sensitive GPI-linked protein with the diacyl structure of the lipid backbone. The functional relevance of this molecule should be further elucidated. In fact, very little is known about the functional significance of these variations in the fatty acid linkage and composition of glycosyl-phosphatidyl inositol among various cell types. They are certainly not relevant for their anchoring function but may profoundly influence their sensitivity to endogenous phospholipases C or D as well as the biological activity of the glycerolipid derivatives resulting from these hydrolysis reactions. The inositol glycan, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidic acid internally generated are well known intermediates in membrane signaling events and activate the cascade of intracellular second messengers (22Nosjean O. Briolay A. Roux B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 153-186Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid are all mitogenic (23Fukami K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 264: 10988-10993Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol is involved in protein kinase C activation (24Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1984; 308: 693-698Google Scholar), and phosphatidic acid can induce growth factor-like effects (25Moolenar W.H. Kruijer W. Tilly B.C. Verlaan I. Bierman A.J. de Laat S.W. Nature. 1986; 323: 171-173Google Scholar), including expression of tyrosine kinases and stimulation of DNA synthesis. The objective of our future work will be to investigate the significance of this unusual PI structure and its consequences for the function of ACA.

In this study, we show that Mg<sup>2+</sup> alone was sufficient to stimulate PI-<i>Mtu</i>I to cleave double-stranded DNA at ectopic sites. In the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, PI-<i>Mtu</i>I formed complexes with topologically different forms of DNA containing ectopic recognition sequences with equal affinity but failed to cleave DNA. We observed that PI-<i>Mtu</i>I was able to inflict double-strand breaks robustly within the ectopic recognition sequence to generate either a blunt end or 1–2-nucleotide 3′-hydroxyl overhangs. Mutational analyses of the presumptive metal ion-binding ligands (Asp<sup>122</sup>, Asp<sup>222</sup>, and Glu<sup>220</sup>) together with immunoprecipitation assays provided compelling evidence to link both the Mg<sup>2+</sup>- and Mn<sup>2+</sup> and ATP-dependent endonuclease activities to PI-<i>Mtu</i>I. The kinetic mechanism of PI-<i>Mtu</i>I promoted cleavage of ectopic DNA sites proceeded through a sequential mechanism with transient accumulation of nicked circular duplex DNA as an intermediate. Together, these data suggest that PI-<i>Mtu</i>I, like group II introns, might mediate ectopic DNA transposition and hence its lateral transfer in natural populations."
