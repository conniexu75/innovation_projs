https://openalex.org/W3021590963,"We report acute antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 285 patients with COVID-19. Within 19 days after symptom onset, 100% of patients tested positive for antiviral immunoglobulin-G (IgG). Seroconversion for IgG and IgM occurred simultaneously or sequentially. Both IgG and IgM titers plateaued within 6 days after seroconversion. Serological testing may be helpful for the diagnosis of suspected patients with negative RT–PCR results and for the identification of asymptomatic infections. A cross-sectional study of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and a longitudinal follow-up study of patients with COVID-19 suggest that SARS-CoV2-specific IgG or IgM seroconversion occurs within 20 days post symptom onset."
https://openalex.org/W3020114628,"All normal somatic cells are thought to acquire mutations, but understanding of the rates, patterns, causes and consequences of somatic mutations in normal cells is limited. The uterine endometrium adopts multiple physiological states over a lifetime and is lined by a gland-forming epithelium1,2. Here, using whole-genome sequencing, we show that normal human endometrial glands are clonal cell populations with total mutation burdens that increase at about 29 base substitutions per year and that are many-fold lower than those of endometrial cancers. Normal endometrial glands frequently carry 'driver' mutations in cancer genes, the burden of which increases with age and decreases with parity. Cell clones with drivers often originate during the first decades of life and subsequently progressively colonize the epithelial lining of the endometrium. Our results show that mutational landscapes differ markedly between normal tissues-perhaps shaped by differences in their structure and physiology-and indicate that the procession of neoplastic change that leads to endometrial cancer is initiated early in life."
https://openalex.org/W3016210073,"The aboveground parts of terrestrial plants, collectively called the phyllosphere, have a key role in the global balance of atmospheric carbon dioxide and oxygen. The phyllosphere represents one of the most abundant habitats for microbiota colonization. Whether and how plants control phyllosphere microbiota to ensure plant health is not well understood. Here we show that the Arabidopsis quadruple mutant (min7 fls2 efr cerk1; hereafter, mfec)1, simultaneously defective in pattern-triggered immunity and the MIN7 vesicle-trafficking pathway, or a constitutively activated cell death1 (cad1) mutant, carrying a S205F mutation in a membrane-attack-complex/perforin (MACPF)-domain protein, harbour altered endophytic phyllosphere microbiota and display leaf-tissue damage associated with dysbiosis. The Shannon diversity index and the relative abundance of Firmicutes were markedly reduced, whereas Proteobacteria were enriched in the mfec and cad1S205F mutants, bearing cross-kingdom resemblance to some aspects of the dysbiosis that occurs in human inflammatory bowel disease. Bacterial community transplantation experiments demonstrated a causal role of a properly assembled leaf bacterial community in phyllosphere health. Pattern-triggered immune signalling, MIN7 and CAD1 are found in major land plant lineages and are probably key components of a genetic network through which terrestrial plants control the level and nurture the diversity of endophytic phyllosphere microbiota for survival and health in a microorganism-rich environment."
https://openalex.org/W3020956046,"Epitaxial heterostructures based on oxide perovskites and III–V, II–VI and transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors form the foundation of modern electronics and optoelectronics1–7. Halide perovskites—an emerging family of tunable semiconductors with desirable properties—are attractive for applications such as solution-processed solar cells, light-emitting diodes, detectors and lasers8–15. Their inherently soft crystal lattice allows greater tolerance to lattice mismatch, making them promising for heterostructure formation and semiconductor integration16,17. Atomically sharp epitaxial interfaces are necessary to improve performance and for device miniaturization. However, epitaxial growth of atomically sharp heterostructures of halide perovskites has not yet been achieved, owing to their high intrinsic ion mobility, which leads to interdiffusion and large junction widths18–21, and owing to their poor chemical stability, which leads to decomposition of prior layers during the fabrication of subsequent layers. Therefore, understanding the origins of this instability and identifying effective approaches to suppress ion diffusion are of great importance22–26. Here we report an effective strategy to substantially inhibit in-plane ion diffusion in two-dimensional halide perovskites by incorporating rigid π-conjugated organic ligands. We demonstrate highly stable and tunable lateral epitaxial heterostructures, multiheterostructures and superlattices. Near-atomically sharp interfaces and epitaxial growth are revealed by low-dose aberration-corrected high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm the reduced heterostructure disorder and larger vacancy formation energies of the two-dimensional perovskites in the presence of conjugated ligands. These findings provide insights into the immobilization and stabilization of halide perovskite semiconductors and demonstrate a materials platform for complex and molecularly thin superlattices, devices and integrated circuits. An epitaxial growth strategy that improves the stability of two-dimensional halide perovskites by inhibiting ion diffusion in their heterostructures using rigid π-conjugated ligands is demonstrated, and shows near-atomically sharp interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W3018363245,"‘Pioneer’ transcription factors are required for stem-cell pluripotency, cell differentiation and cell reprogramming1,2. Pioneer factors can bind nucleosomal DNA to enable gene expression from regions of the genome with closed chromatin. SOX2 is a prominent pioneer factor that is essential for pluripotency and self-renewal of embryonic stem cells3. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of the DNA-binding domains of SOX2 and its close homologue SOX11 bound to nucleosomes. The structures show that SOX factors can bind and locally distort DNA at superhelical location 2. The factors also facilitate detachment of terminal nucleosomal DNA from the histone octamer, which increases DNA accessibility. SOX-factor binding to the nucleosome can also lead to a repositioning of the N-terminal tail of histone H4 that includes residue lysine 16. We speculate that this repositioning is incompatible with higher-order nucleosome stacking, which involves contacts of the H4 tail with a neighbouring nucleosome. Our results indicate that pioneer transcription factors can use binding energy to initiate chromatin opening, and thereby facilitate nucleosome remodelling and subsequent transcription. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the DNA-binding domains of the pioneer transcription factor SOX2 and its close homologue SOX11 elucidate the role of these factors in initiating chromatin opening and nucleosome remodelling."
https://openalex.org/W3016091053,"Neurodevelopment is characterized by rapid rates of neural cell proliferation and differentiation followed by massive cell death in which more than half of all recently generated brain cells are pruned back. Large amounts of DNA damage, cellular debris, and by-products of cellular stress are generated during these neurodevelopmental events, all of which can potentially activate immune signalling. How the immune response to this collateral damage influences brain maturation and function remains unknown. Here we show that the AIM2 inflammasome contributes to normal brain development and that disruption of this immune sensor of genotoxic stress leads to behavioural abnormalities. During infection, activation of the AIM2 inflammasome in response to double-stranded DNA damage triggers the production of cytokines as well as a gasdermin-D-mediated form of cell death known as pyroptosis1-4. We observe pronounced AIM2 inflammasome activation in neurodevelopment and find that defects in this sensor of DNA damage result in anxiety-related behaviours in mice. Furthermore, we show that the AIM2 inflammasome contributes to central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis specifically through its regulation of gasdermin-D, and not via its involvement in the production of the cytokines IL-1 and/or IL-18. Consistent with a role for this sensor of genomic stress in the purging of genetically compromised CNS cells, we find that defective AIM2 inflammasome signalling results in decreased neural cell death both in response to DNA damage-inducing agents and during neurodevelopment. Moreover, mutations in AIM2 lead to excessive accumulation of DNA damage in neurons as well as an increase in the number of neurons that incorporate into the adult brain. Our findings identify the inflammasome as a crucial player in establishing a properly formed CNS through its role in the removal of genetically compromised cells."

https://openalex.org/W3020883912,"Background South Africa became the first country in Africa to introduce oral PrEP in June 2016. The National Department of Health has used a phased approach to rollout, allowing for a dynamic learn-and-adapt process which will lead ultimately to scale-up. Phased rollout began with provision of oral PrEP at facilities providing services to sex workers in 2016 and was expanded in 2017, first to facilities providing services to MSM and then to students at selected university campus clinics, followed by provision at primary health care facilities. Programmatic data shows variability in initiation and continuation between these populations. This study examines factors related to PrEP initiation, continuation, and discontinuation at facilities providing services to sex workers and MSM during the national PrEP rollout. Methods A cross-sectional survey was administered September 2017-January 2018 among clients (ages 18–62 and providers at 9 facilities implementing oral PrEP in South Africa, followed by in-depth interviews. The client survey captured PrEP initiation, continuation and discontinuation. Analysis was performed in STATA 13 for survey data and thematic analysis was performed in NViVO 11 for in-depth interview data. Results 299 clients (203 from sex worker facilities, 96 from MSM facilities) participated in the survey and additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted with 29 clients. Participants self-identified as either current users (n = 94; 36.2%), past users (n = 80; 30.8%) and never users of PrEP (n = 86; 33.1%). Participants who had never used PrEP either cited not being offered PrEP by a provider (57%, n = 49) or declining PrEP (43%, n = 37) as reasons for lack of uptake. The primary reason for declining to use oral PrEP was fear of side effects (41.7%, n = 15). The primary reasons for initiating and continuing on oral PrEP were all related to perceived risk associated with sexual activity. The majority of participants (87.9%, n = 153) also noted that printed IEC materials influenced their decision to initiate PrEP. Qualitative data suggested that several clients initiated on PrEP because they wanted additional protection beyond using condoms due to challenges such as partners refusing to use condoms, having partners with unknown HIV status, having multiple partners, involvement in sex work, or having a partner living with HIV. The majority (73.8%, n = 59) of participants who discontinued oral PrEP cited side effects as the primary reason for discontinuation, followed by feeling stigmatized (18.8%, n = 15). Conclusion This study provides valuable insights on early rollout of PrEP of how clients perceive oral PrEP and where to target efforts to improve the uptake of this highly effective HIV prevention product. By identifying strengths and areas for improvement, the ACCESS study has generated evidence that can be used to guide high quality scale-up in South Africa and may be instructive for other countries’ efforts to expand quality access to oral PrEP."
https://openalex.org/W3017052332,"Abstract Education is a key dimension of well-being and a crucial indicator of development 1–4 . The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) prioritize progress in education, with a new focus on inequality 5–7 . Here we model the within-country distribution of years of schooling, and use this model to explore educational inequality since 1970 and to forecast progress towards the education-related 2030 SDG targets. We show that although the world is largely on track to achieve near-universal primary education by 2030, substantial challenges remain in the completion rates for secondary and tertiary education. Globally, the gender gap in schooling had nearly closed by 2018 but gender disparities remained acute in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, and North Africa and the Middle East. It is predicted that, by 2030, females will have achieved significantly higher educational attainment than males in 18 countries. Inequality in education reached a peak globally in 2017 and is projected to decrease steadily up to 2030. The distributions and inequality metrics presented here represent a framework that can be used to track the progress of each country towards the SDG targets and the level of inequality over time. Reducing educational inequality is one way to promote a fairer distribution of human capital and the development of more equitable human societies."
https://openalex.org/W3016628959,"R-type bacteriocins are minimal contractile nanomachines that hold promise as precision antibiotics1-4. Each bactericidal complex uses a collar to bridge a hollow tube with a contractile sheath loaded in a metastable state by a baseplate scaffold1,2. Fine-tuning of such nucleic acid-free protein machines for precision medicine calls for an atomic description of the entire complex and contraction mechanism, which is not available from baseplate structures of the (DNA-containing) T4 bacteriophage5. Here we report the atomic model of the complete R2 pyocin in its pre-contraction and post-contraction states, each containing 384 subunits of 11 unique atomic models of 10 gene products. Comparison of these structures suggests the following sequence of events during pyocin contraction: tail fibres trigger lateral dissociation of baseplate triplexes; the dissociation then initiates a cascade of events leading to sheath contraction; and this contraction converts chemical energy into mechanical force to drive the iron-tipped tube across the bacterial cell surface, killing the bacterium."

https://openalex.org/W3020884513,"Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most lethal malignancy and is characterized by poor immunogenicity. Pancreatic cancer cells have various strategies to suppress host immune response, evade immune defenses, and facilitate tumor growth and development. As a mode of long-range intercellular communication, cancer-derived exosomes contribute to impairment of the immune system. However, the mechanisms that induce changes in the activities of signal transduction pathways in immune cells, which are influenced by tumor-derived exosomes, are poorly understood. We (1) treated peripheral T lymphocytes with pancreatic cancer-derived exosomes, tagged CD63 with tdTomato, to trace exosome transfer from pancreatic cancer cells to T lymphocytes; (2) carried out a cytotoxicity assay of exosome-treated T lymphocytes using the Real Time Cellular Analysis system; (3) performed RNA sequencing and gene set enrichment analysis to explore the pivotal signaling pathway that mediates apoptosis in exosome-treated T lymphocytes; and (4) demonstrated the role of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in exosome-induced T-lymphocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, these results indicate that pancreatic cancer cells secrete exosomes, which are taken up by T lymphocytes to activate p38 MAPK, and then induce ER stress-mediated apoptosis, ultimately causing immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W3023363503,"Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 201 Listeria monocytogenes isolates recovered from 102 of 27,389 refrigerated ready-to-eat (RTE) food samples purchased at retail in U.S. FoodNet sites as part of the 2010-2013 interagency L. monocytogenes Market Basket Survey (Lm MBS). Core genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) and in-silico analyses were conducted, and these data were analyzed with metadata for isolates from five food groups: produce, seafood, dairy, meat, and combination foods. Six of 201 isolates, from 3 samples, were subsequently confirmed as L. welshimeri. Three samples contained one isolate per sample; mmong the 96 samples that contained two isolates per sample, 3 samples each contained two different strains and 93 samples each contained duplicate isolates. After 93 duplicate isolates were removed, the remaining 102 isolates were delineated into 29 clonal complexes (CCs) or singletons based on their sequence type. The five most prevalent CCs were CC155, CC1, CC5, CC87, and CC321. The Shannon's diversity index for clones per food group ranged from 1.49 for dairy to 2.32 for produce isolates, which were not significantly different in pairwise comparisons. The most common molecular serogroup as determined by in-silico analysis was IIa (45.6%), followed by IIb (27.2%), IVb (20.4%), and IIc (4.9%). The proportions of isolates within lineages I, II, and III were 48.0%, 50.0% and 2.0%, respectively. Full-length inlA was present in 89.3% of isolates. Listeria pathogenicity island 3 (LIPI-3) and LIPI-4 were found in 51% and 30.6% of lineage I isolates, respectively. Stress survival islet 1 (SSI-1) was present in 34.7% of lineage I isolates, 80.4% of lineage II isolates and the 2 lineage III isolates; SSI-2 was present only in the CC121 isolate. Plasmids were found in 48% of isolates, including 24.5% of lineage I isolates and 72.5% of lineage II isolates. Among the plasmid-carrying isolates, 100% contained at least one cadmium resistance cassette and 89.8% contained bcrABC, involved in quaternary ammonium compound tolerance. Multiple clusters of isolates from different food samples were identified by cgMLST which, along with available metadata, could aid in the investigation of possible cross-contamination and persistence events."
https://openalex.org/W3022881614,"A composite pain scale for assessing and quantifying pain in rabbits (CANCRS) has been designed merging the Rabbit Grimace Scale (RbtGS) and a scale including clinical parameters (CPS). Construct validity and inter-rater reliability were assessed for CANCRS, for RbtGS and for CPS, in order to test their potential to detect pain in a clinical setting. Rabbits (n = 116) were either hybrids or purebreds and they were independently evaluated by two raters, who could be veterinarians (V) or veterinary medicine students (S). Score intervals determined four pain classes (No pain, Discomfort, Moderate pain and Severe pain) that matched presumptive pain classes associated with some pathological conditions. A chi-square test was used to assess the construct validity of the scales by checking how frequently scale results and presumptive pain classes matched. Sixty-nine patients were evaluated by one V and one S, whereas forty-seven rabbits were assessed by two V, in order to test inter-rater reliability. An intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to test reliability of the scales, whereas Cohen’s kappa tested inter-rater agreement for each parameter of the CANCRS. Construct validity results show that CANCRS and RbtGS efficiently reveal pain (P ≤ 0.05), while CPS does not (p > 0.05). Inter-rater reliability was very good for both CANCRS and CPS (ICC 0.88 V-V, 0.94 between V-S; ICC 0.97 V-V, 0.91 V-S) and good for RbtGS (ICC 0.77 V-V, 0.88 V-S); therefore, CPS reproducibility was better between veterinarians and students than between veterinarians. Inter-rater agreement between veterinarians and veterinary medicine students was moderate to very good for all the parameters included in the CANCRS (Cohen’s kappa >0,60). In conclusion, it is possible to state that the CANCRS has construct validity and it is a reliable tool for use in clinical practice, when coping with many rabbits with morphological differences. It is easy and fast to use and enriches the RbtGS with some clinical parameters that should be monitored during any clinical examination, allowing for capture of the multidimensional aspect of pain."
https://openalex.org/W3022367101,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has long been recognized as an energy-consuming organ and a possible target for combating metabolism disorder. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of phytochemical phenolic acids to improve obesity by activating BAT, the underlying mechanism or mechanism therein remain obscure. In this study, diet-induced obese mice, genetically obese mice, and C3H10T1/2 cells were used to examine the effects of p-Coumaric acid (CA) on metabolism profiles. The results showed that CA prevented metabolic syndromes in the two mice models through the activation of BAT. This phenomenon was closely linked to the upregulation of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) and the accelerated burning of fatty acids and glucose, which consequently enhanced the energy expenditure and thermogenesis. Similar results were also obtained in vitro. Importantly, these effects were mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1)-RPS6 pathway. These findings reveal, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, the close correlation between mTORC1-RPS6 and BAT-mediated thermogenesis, and, in addition, the key role played by mTORC1-RPS6 in mediating phenolic acids-induced activation of BAT, thus preventing obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3022428603,"The aim of this study is to investigate the factors influencing consumer willingness to accept the use of insects to feed poultry, cattle, pigs, and fish. To reach this objective, we conducted an online survey with Brazilian consumers. 600 questionnaires were collected. We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and logistic regression models. In general, the use of insects to feed poultry, pigs and cattle was not widely accepted. A more widely acceptance was found for the use of insects to feed fish. The results of logistic regressions models show that positive attitudes are associated with a higher probability of accepting the use of insects to feed poultry, pigs, cattle, and fish. Perceived benefits were associated with a higher likelihood of accepting the use of insects to feed fish. However, perceived benefits were also associated with a lower likelihood of accepting the use of insects to feed poultry. Perceived challenges were associated with a higher likelihood of accepting the use of insects to feed poultry. However, perceived challenges were associated with a lower likelihood of accepting the use of insects to feed pigs."
https://openalex.org/W3022677726,"In inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, vascular enlargement is associated with endothelial cell proliferation, release of cytokines and adhesion molecule expression. Interleukin (IL)-17A is a pro-inflammatory cytokine mainly secreted by T helper-17 cells that is critically involved in psoriasis pathogenesis. IL-36α, IL-36β and IL-36γ are also inflammatory cytokines up-regulated in psoriasis and induced by various stimuli, including IL-17A. In this study, we found that human keratinocytes are the main source of IL-36, in particular of IL-36γ. This cytokine was strongly induced by IL-17A and, together with IL-17A, efficiently activated human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMECs), which expressed both IL-17 and IL-36 receptors. Both IL-36γ and IL-17A induced cell proliferation through specific molecular cascades involving ERK1/2 only or ERK1/2, STAT3 and NF-κB, respectively. We highlighted the intense IL-17A- and IL-36γ -dependent interplay between keratinocytes and HDMECs, likely active in the psoriatic lesions and leading to the establishment of a cytokine network responsible for the development and maintenance of the inflamed state. IL-17A or IL-36γ showed in HDMECs a synergic activity with TNF-α by potently inducing inflammatory cytokine/chemokine release and ICAM-1 expression. We also investigated the involvement of IL-36γ and VEGF-A, substantially reduced in lesional skin of psoriatic patients pharmacologically treated with the anti-IL-17A antibody Secukinumab. Importantly, keratinocyte-derived IL-36γ represented an additional pro-angiogenic mediator of IL-17A. We observed that keratinocyte-derived VEGF-A influenced proliferation but did not act on expression of adhesion molecules in HDMECs. On the other hand, inhibition of IL-36γ released by IL-17A-treated keratinocytes impaired either proliferation or ICAM-1 expression both in HDMECs and in an in vivo murine model of psoriasis. Taken together, our data demonstrated that IL-17A and IL-36γ are highly involved in endothelial cells/keratinocytes crosstalk in inflammatory skin conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3022823919,"Background The high incidence (32.9, age-standardized per 100,000) and mortality (23.0, age-standardized per 100,000) of cervical cancer (CC) in Ghana have been largely attributed to low screening uptake (0.8%). Although the low cost (Visual inspection with acetic acid) screening services available at various local health facilities screening uptake is meager. Objective The purpose of the study is to determine the barriers influencing CC screening among women in the Ashanti Region of Ghana using the health belief model. Methods A analytical cross-sectional study design was conducted between January and March 2019 at Kenyase, the Ashanti Region of Ghana. The study employed self-administered questionnaires were used to collect data from 200 women. Descriptive statistics were used to examine the differences in interest and non-interest in participating in CC screening on barriers affecting CC screening. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors affecting CC screening at a significance level of p<0.05. Results Unemployed women were less likely to have an interest in CC screening than those who were employed (adjustes odds ratio (aOR) = 0.005, 95%CI:0.001–0.041, p = 0.005). Women who were highly educated were 122 times very likely to be interested in CC screening than those with no or low formal education (aOR = 121.915 95%CI: 14.096–1054.469, p<0.001) and those who were unmarried were less likely to be interested in CC screening than those with those who were married (aOR = 0.124, 95%CI: 0.024–0.647, p = 0.013). Also, perceived threat, perceived benefits, perceived barriers and cues for action showed significant differences with interest in participating in screening with a P-values <0.003. The association was different for long waiting time, prioritizing early morning and late evening screening which showed no significant difference (P-value > 0.003). Conclusions Married women, unemployed and those with no formal education are less likely to participate in CC screening. The study details significant barriers to cervical cancer screening uptake in Ghana. It is recommended that the Ghana health services should develop appropriate, culturally tailored educational materials to inform individuals with no formal education through health campaigns in schools, churches and communities to enhance CC screening uptake."
https://openalex.org/W3023665135,"Sequence count data are commonly modelled using the negative binomial (NB) distribution. Several empirical studies, however, have demonstrated that methods based on the NB-assumption do not always succeed in controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at its nominal level. In this paper, we propose a dedicated statistical goodness of fit test for the NB distribution in regression models and demonstrate that the NB-assumption is violated in many publicly available RNA-Seq and 16S rRNA microbiome datasets. The zero-inflated NB distribution was not found to give a substantially better fit. We also show that the NB-based tests perform worse on the features for which the NB-assumption was violated than on the features for which no significant deviation was detected. This gives an explanation for the poor behaviour of NB-based tests in many published evaluation studies. We conclude that nonparametric tests should be preferred over parametric methods."
https://openalex.org/W3022993763,"It has been documented that M2 macrophage polarization plays a suppressive role in atherosclerosis in diabetes mellitus (DM). In addition, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is implicated in the development of M2 macrophage polarization. Therefore, the study aimed to investigate the specific mechanism of PGE2 in M2 macrophage polarization in diabetic coronary atherosclerosis (DMAS). Initially, clinical samples were obtained and DMAS mouse model was established. The expression of BDNF was determined, and M1 and M2 macrophage polarizations were evaluated. Then, the levels of BDNF and PGE2 were modified in DMAS mice and the serum indicator, atherosclerotic plaque, lipid uptake by PBMCs, as well as M1 and M2 macrophage polarization were determined. Macrophages were isolated and the effects of PGE2 and the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway on M2 macrophage polarization were explored. BDNF was downregulated and macrophages were differentiated into M1 in DMAS patients and mice. BDNF and PGE2 were observed to promote M2 macrophage polarization, where atherosclerotic plaque and lipid uptake by PBMCs were reduced, and DMAS was alleviated in mice. Overexpression of BDNF activated the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway and stimulated M2 macrophage polarization in macrophages. PGE2 stimulated M2 macrophage polarization by inducing KLF4 via the activation of the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. This study demonstrates that PGE2 promotes M2 macrophage polarization by activating the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, thus alleviating DMAS."
https://openalex.org/W3022482350,"Human adenovirus (HAdV-7) is a highly contagious pathogen that causes severe respiratory illnesses. However, the epidemic patterns and genetic variability of HAdV-7 circulating in mainland China have not been well elucidated. In this study, we used Chinese HAdV sentinel surveillance data obtained from 2012–2015 to investigate the clinical features of 122 HAdV-7-positive cases and performed amplification and sequence determination of three capsid genes (penton base, hexon, and fiber) from 69 isolated viruses covering from seven provinces of China. Additionally, we compared with data from representative sequences of 21 strains covering seven more provinces in China and 32 international HAdV-7 strains obtained from GenBank database to determine the phylogenetic, sequence variations, and molecular evolution of HAdV-7. The results indicated that HAdV-7 infection occurred throughout the year, and a high proportion of severe cases (27 cases, 22.1%) exhibited infantile pneumonia. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis showed that all HAdV-7 strains could be divided into two major evolutionary branches, including subtype 1 and subtype 2, and subtype 3 was also formed according to analysis of the penton base gene. Subtypes 1 and 2 co-circulated in China before 2008, and HAdV-7 strains currently circulating in China belonged to subtype 2, which was also the predominant strain circulating worldwide in recent years. Further sequence variation analysis indicated that three genes of HAdV-7 were relatively stable across time and geographic space, particularly for viruses within subtypes, which shared almost the same variation sites. Owing to continuous outbreaks caused by HAdV-7, resulting in increased illness severity and fatality rates in China, the establishment of a national HAdV surveillance system is urgently needed for the development of effective preventive and infection-control interventions for adenovirus respiratory infections in China."
https://openalex.org/W3023012035,"Black soldier fly (BSF; Hermetia illucens L.) larvae can convert fresh pig manure into protein and fat-rich biomass, which can then be used as aquafeed for select species. Currently, BSF is the only approved insect for such purposes in Canada, USA, and the European Union. Pig manure could serve as a feed substrate for BSF; however, it is contaminated with zoonotic pathogens (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella spp.). Fortunately, BSF larvae inhibit many of these zoonotic pathogens; however, the mechanisms employed are unclear. We employed RNAi, qRT-PCR, and Illumina MiSeq 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing to examine the interaction between two immune genes (Duox in Duox-reactive oxygen species [ROS] immune system and TLR3 in the Toll signaling pathway) and select pathogens common in pig manure to decipher the mechanisms resulting in pathogen suppression. Results indicate Bsf Duox-TLR3 RNAi increased bacterial load but decreased relative abundance of Providencia and Dysgonomonas, which are thought to be commensals in the BSF larval gut. Bsf Duox-TLR3 RNAi also inactivated the NF-κB signaling pathway, downregulated the expression of antimicrobial peptides, and diminished inhibitory effects on zoonotic pathogen. The resulting dysbiosis stimulated an immune response by activating BsfDuox and promoting ROS, which regulated the composition and structure of the gut bacterial community. Thus, BsfDuox and BsfTLR3 are important factors in regulating these key gut microbes, while inhibiting target zoonotic pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W3021869532,"We introduce and validate the use of commercially available human mobility datasets based on cell phone locations to estimate visitation to natural areas. By combining this data with on-the-ground observations of visitation to water recreation areas in New England, we fit a model to estimate daily visitation for four months to more than 500 sites. The results show the potential for this new big data source of human mobility to overcome limitations in traditional methods of estimating visitation and to provide consistent information at policy-relevant scales. However, the data providers’ opaque and rapidly developing methods for processing locational information required a calibration and validation against data collected by traditional means to confidently reproduce the desired estimates of visitation. We found that with this calibration, the high-resolution information in both space and time provided by cell phone location-derived data creates opportunities for developing next-generation models of human interactions with the natural environment."

Murphy Roth's Large (MRL/MpJ) mice exhibit improved healing following acute tendon injuries, but the driver of this regenerative healing response remains unknown. The tissue-specific attributes of this healing response, despite a shared systemic environment within the mouse, support the hypothesis of a tissue-driven mechanism for scarless healing. Our objective was to investigate the potential of MRL/MpJ tendon extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived coatings to regulate scar-mediated healing. We found that deviations in the composition of key structural proteins within MRL/MpJ vs C57Bl/6 tendons occur synergistically to mediate the improvements in structure and mechanics following a 1-mm midsubstance injury. Improvement in mechanical properties of healing MRL/MpJ vs C57Bl/6 tendons that were isolated from systemic contributions via organ culture, highlighted the innate tendon environment as the driver of scarless healing. Finally, we established that decellularized coatings derived from early-deposited MRL/MpJ tendon provisional extracellular matrix (provisional-ECM), can modulate canonical healing B6 tendon cell behavior by inducing morphological changes and increasing proliferation in vitro. This study supports that the unique compositional cues in MRL/MpJ provisional-ECM have the therapeutic capability to motivate canonically healing cells toward improved behavior; enhancing our ability to develop effective therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W3023092783,"Peanut (Arachis hypogaea) is mainly grown for oil extraction and the remaining oil-free seed referred as peanut meal (PM) leaves with high protein content which can be a possible substitute for fishmeal in aqua-diets. This study evaluates the suitability of three types of processed peanut seeds, namely untreated PM (UPM), fermented PM (FPM), and germinated PM (GPM) from peanut seeds to replace fishmeal in barramundi (Lates calcarifer) diets cultured under a commercial production environment. Nine formulated diets having 3 inclusion levels from the 3 different peanuts (15%, 30% and 60% fishmeal replacement) were evaluated against a control without PM. The performance of various types and levels of PMs was assessed by examining the growth, gut and liver condition and survival of fish after eight weeks of feeding the test diets. The immunological responses of juvenile barramundi were assessed by exposing the fish to the hypoxic conditions for 4 hours. The results showed that fermentation and germination significantly (P<0.05) reduced the tannins and alkaloid contents in the PMs. The fish fed 15% GPM diet grew faster and had higher survival than fish fed control diet, while fish fed diet including 60% GPM showed a significant reduction in growth and survival, and an increase in food conversion rate (FCR). FPM and UPM at any inclusion levels did not alter the growth, survival and FCR. Histology analysis revealed that fish fed 60% GPM and UPM showed higher amount of lipid droplets in liver, myodigeneration in fish muscle and a decrease number of acidic mucins in distal gut compare to all other test diets. Stress caused by reduced dissolved oxygen did not change the sodium, potassium, chlorides and alanine aminotransferase concentrations of plasma of fish fed any diet. However, the stress did increase plasma cortisol significantly (P<0.05) in fish fed 60% GPM, 30% and 60% UPM diets. These results suggest that the PMs can partly replace the fishmeal in juvenile barramundi diet and the processing further improves the PMs quality by reducing its antinutritional factors which in turn can increase either its inclusion level in the barramundi diets or improved growth and health status of the species."
https://openalex.org/W3022607465,"Predicting innovation is a peculiar problem in data science. Following its definition, an innovation is always a never-seen-before event, leaving no room for traditional supervised learning approaches. Here we propose a strategy to address the problem in the context of innovative patents, by defining innovations as never-seen-before associations of technologies and exploiting self-supervised learning techniques. We think of technological codes present in patents as a vocabulary and the whole technological corpus as written in a specific, evolving language. We leverage such structure with techniques borrowed from Natural Language Processing by embedding technologies in a high dimensional euclidean space where relative positions are representative of learned semantics. Proximity in this space is an effective predictor of specific innovation events, that outperforms a wide range of standard link-prediction metrics. The success of patented innovations follows a complex dynamics characterized by different patterns which we analyze in details with specific examples. The methods proposed in this paper provide a completely new way of understanding and forecasting innovation, by tackling it from a revealing perspective and opening interesting scenarios for a number of applications and further analytic approaches."
https://openalex.org/W3022509234,"Microorganisms living in saline environments are forced to regulate turgor via the synthesis of organic osmoprotective compounds. Microbial adaptation to fluctuations in external salinity includes degradation of compatible solutes. Here we have examined the biochemical pathway of degradation of the cyclic imino acid ectoine, the major osmoprotector in halotolerant methane-utilizing bacteria.The BLAST search of the genes involved in ectoine degradation in the halotolerant methanotroph Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z was performed with the reference sequences of Halomonas elongata. The genes for the key enzymes of the pathway were disrupted by insertion mutagenesis and the cellular metabolites in the methanol extracts of mutant cells were analyzed by HPLC. The doeA gene from Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli to identify the product of ectoine hydrolysis catalyzed by ectoine hydrolase DoeA.We have shown that the halotolerant methanotroph Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z possesses the doeBDAC gene cluster coding for putative ectoine hydrolase (DoeA), Nα-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate deacetylase (DoeB), diaminobutyrate transaminase (DoeD) and aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (DoeC). The deletion of the doeA gene resulted in accumulation of the higher level of ectoine compared to the wild type strain. Nγ-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate (Nγ-acetyl-DAB), a substrate for ectoine synthase, was found in the cytoplasm of the wild type strain. Nα-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutyrate (Nα-acetyl-DAB), a substrate for the DoeB enzyme, appeared in the cells as a result of exposure of the doeB mutant to low osmotic pressure. The genes for the enzymes involved in ectoine degradation were found in all aerobic methylotrophs capable of ectoine biosynthesis. These results provide the first evidence for the in vivo operation of the ectoine degradation pathway in methanotrophs and thus expand our understanding of the regulation mechanisms of bacterial osmoadaptation.During adaptation to the changes in external osmolarity, halophilic and halotolerant methylotrophs cleave ectoine, thereby entering the carbon and nitrogen of the compatible solute to the central metabolic pathways. The biochemical route of ectoine degradation in the halotolerant methanotroph Mm. alcaliphilum 20Z is similar to that in heterotrophic halophiles. We have shown that ectoine hydrolase DoeA in this methanotroph hydrolyzes ectoine with the formation of the only isomer: Nα-acetyl-DAB. All aerobic methylotrophs capable of ectoine biosynthesis harbor the genetic determinants for ectoine degradation."
https://openalex.org/W3023917307,"We examined reading, spelling, and mathematical skills in an unselected group of 129 Italian fifth graders by testing various cognitive predictors for each behaviour. As dependent variables, we measured performance in behaviours with a clear functional value in everyday life, such as reading a text, spelling under dictation and doing mental and written computations. As predictors, we selected cognitive dimensions having an explicit relation with the target behaviour (called proximal predictors), and prepared various tests in order to select which task had the best predictive power on each behaviour. The aim was to develop a model of proximal predictors of reading (speed and accuracy), spelling (accuracy) and maths (speed and accuracy) characterized by efficacy also in comparison to the prediction based on general cognitive factors (i.e., short-term memory, phonemic verbal fluency, visual perceptual speed, and non-verbal intelligence) and parsimony, pinpointing the role of both common and unique predictors as envisaged in the general perspective of co-morbidity. With one exception (reading accuracy), the proximal predictors models (based on communality analyses) explained a sizeable amount of variance, ranging from 27.5% in the case of calculation (accuracy) to 48.7% of reading (fluency). Models based on general cognitive factors also accounted for some variance (ranging from 6.5% in the case of spelling to 19.5% in the case of reading fluency) but this was appreciably less than that explained by models based on the hypothesized proximal predictors. In general, results confirmed the efficacy of proximal models in predicting reading, spelling and maths although they offered only limited support for common predictors across different learning skills; namely, performance in the Orthographic Decision test entered as a predictor of both reading and spelling indicating that a single orthographic lexicon may account for performance in reading and spelling. Possible lines of research to expand on this approach are illustrated."
https://openalex.org/W3020825672,"Despite women’s awareness that drinking alcohol in pregnancy can lead to lifelong disabilities in a child, it appears that an awareness alone does not discourage some pregnant women from drinking. To explore influences on pregnant women’s choices around alcohol use, we conducted interviews and group discussions with 14 Indigenous Australian and 14 non-Indigenous pregnant women attending antenatal care in a range of socioeconomic settings. Inductive content analysis identified five main influences on pregnant women’s alcohol use: the level and detail of women’s understanding of harm; women’s information sources on alcohol use in pregnancy; how this information influenced their choices; how women conceptualised their pregnancy; and whether the social and cultural environment supported abstinence. Results provide insight into how Indigenous Australian and non-Indigenous pregnant women understand and conceptualise the harms from drinking alcohol when making drinking choices, including how their social and cultural environments impact their ability to abstain. Strategies for behaviour change need to: correct misinformation about supposed ‘safe’ timing, quantity and types of alcohol; develop a more accurate perception of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder; reframe messages about harm to messages about optimising the child’s health and cognitive outcomes; and develop a holistic approach encompassing women’s social and cultural context."
https://openalex.org/W3023540193,"The Baltic Sea summer phytoplankton community plays an important role in biogeochemical cycling and in the transfer of energy through the food web via zooplankton. We aimed to improve the understanding of the degree to which large-scale versus local environmental dynamics regulate phytoplankton dynamics by analyzing time series at the Baltic Sea scale. We used dynamic factor analysis to study if there are common patterns of interannual variation that are shared (“common trends”) among summer phytoplankton total and class-level biomass time series observed across Baltic Sea latitudinal gradients in salinity and temperature. We evaluated alternative hypotheses regarding common trends among summer phytoplankton biomass: Baltic Sea-wide common trends; common trends by geography (latitude and basin); common trends differing among functional groups (phytoplankton classes); or common trends driven by both geography and functional group. Our results indicated little support for a common trend in total summer phytoplankton biomass. At a finer resolution, classes had common trends that were most closely associated with the cryptophyte and cyanobacteria time series with patterns that differed between northern and southern sampling stations. These common trends were also very sensitive to two anomalous years (1990, 2008) of cryptophyte biomass. The Baltic Sea Index, a regional climate index, was correlated with two common class trends that shifted in mean state around the mid-1990s. The limited coherence in phytoplankton biomass variation over time despite known, large-scale, ecosystem shifts suggests that stochastic dynamics at local scales limits the ability to observe common trends at the scale of monitoring data collection."
https://openalex.org/W3021452156,"During human erythroid maturation, Hsp70 translocates into the nucleus and protects GATA-1 from caspase-3 cleavage. Failure of Hsp70 to localize to the nucleus was found in Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) erythroblasts and can induce dyserythropoiesis, with arrest of maturation and death of erythroblasts. However, the mechanism of the nuclear trafficking of Hsp70 in erythroblasts remains unknown. Here, we found the hematopoietic transcriptional regulator, EDAG, to be a novel binding partner of Hsp70 that forms a protein complex with Hsp70 and GATA-1 during human normal erythroid differentiation. EDAG overexpression blocked the cytoplasmic translocation of Hsp70 induced by EPO deprivation, inhibited GATA-1 degradation, thereby promoting erythroid maturation in an Hsp70-dependent manner. Furthermore, in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with dyserythropoiesis, EDAG is dramatically down-regulated, and forced expression of EDAG has been found to restore the localization of Hsp70 in the nucleus and elevate the protein level of GATA-1 to a significant extent. In addition, EDAG rescued the dyserythropoiesis of MDS patients by increasing erythroid differentiation and decreasing cell apoptosis. This study demonstrates the molecular mechanism of Hsp70 nuclear sustaining during erythroid maturation and establishes that EDAG might be a suitable therapeutic target for dyserythropoiesis in MDS patients."
https://openalex.org/W3022101155,"Introduction Physician is a central figure in the client list of clinical laboratory. Monitoring physicians’ satisfaction with laboratory service is an important indicator of the quality management system and required by international laboratory standards. However, there is no national data on physician satisfaction with laboratory services in Ethiopia. Therefore, the aim of this national survey was to assess satisfaction level of physicians with laboratory services at public hospitals in Ethiopia. Methods Institutional based cross-sectional study design was employed from November 1-30/2017. A total of 327 physicians were randomly selected from 60 public hospitals from all regions of Ethiopia. Data was collected using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire and analyzed with SPSS version 23 software. Logistic regression model was fitted to identify predictors of physician satisfaction with laboratory services. A p-value of less than 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results Overall, 55% of physicians were satisfied with the clinical laboratory services. More than half of the physicians were satisfied with the existing laboratory request form (69%), legibility and completeness of laboratory report (61%), notification of new test (78%) and test interruption (70%). On the other hand, many physicians were dissatisfied with the absence of laboratory hand book (87.5%), the existing test menu (68%), lab-physician interface (62%), availability of referral and/or back up service (62%), notification of Turn Around Time (TAT) (54%), timely notification of panic result (55%), long TAT (33.1%), provision of urgent service (67%), and timely advisory service (57%). Most of the physicians perceived that consistent quality of service was not delivered at all working shifts (71%). At 5% level of significance, we did not find enough evidence to conclude that sex, age, marital status, education level, and experience were statistically associated with physician satisfaction (p-values > 0.05). Conclusion This national survey revealed nearly half of the physicians were unsatisfied with laboratory service at public hospitals in Ethiopia, which mainly related to lack of adequate test menu, laboratory hand book, on time notification of panic result, provision of urgent service, timely advisory service, delivery of quality services in all working shifts and weak lab-physician interface. Therefore, hospital management should address the gaps and improve the needs of physicians for better patient health care. In addition, laboratories should evaluate and monitor physician satisfaction level at regular interval."
https://openalex.org/W3021283815,"Improved computational modeling of protein translation rates, including better prediction of where translational slowdowns along an mRNA sequence may occur, is critical for understanding co-translational folding. Because codons within a synonymous codon group are translated at different rates, many computational translation models rely on analyzing synonymous codons. Some models rely on genome-wide codon usage bias (CUB), believing that globally rare and common codons are the most informative of slow and fast translation, respectively. Others use the CUB observed only in highly expressed genes, which should be under selective pressure to be translated efficiently (and whose CUB may therefore be more indicative of translation rates). No prior work has analyzed these models for their ability to predict translational slowdowns. Here, we evaluate five models for their association with slowly translated positions as denoted by two independent ribosome footprint (RFP) count experiments from S. cerevisiae, because RFP data is often considered as a “ground truth” for translation rates across mRNA sequences. We show that all five considered models strongly associate with the RFP data and therefore have potential for estimating translational slowdowns. However, we also show that there is a weak correlation between RFP counts for the same genes originating from independent experiments, even when their experimental conditions are similar. This raises concerns about the efficacy of using current RFP experimental data for estimating translation rates and highlights a potential advantage of using computational models to understand translation rates instead."
https://openalex.org/W3023862990,"Fetal and placental growth disorders are common in maternal human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and can be attributed to both the infection and comorbidities not associated with HIV. We describe placental growth disorders and adverse reproductive outcomes in HIV-infected pregnant women whose delivery occurred between 2001-2014 in Vitoria, Brazil. Cases with gestational age (GA) ≥ than 22 weeks validated by ultrasonography, with placental and fetal weight dimensions at birth, were studied. Outcomes were summarized as proportions of small (SGA), appropriate (AGA), and large (LGA) for GA when the z-score values were below -1.28, between -1.28 and +1.28, or above +1.28, respectively. Of 187 fetal attachment requisitions, 122(65.2%) women and their newborns participated in the study. The median maternal age was 28 years and 81(66.4%) underwent ≥ 6 prenatal visits. A total of 81(66.4%) were diagnosed before current pregnancy; 68(55.7%) exhibited criteria for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); 64(52.4%) had detectable viral load; 25(20.5%) cases presented SGA placental weight and 6(4.9%) SGA placental thickness. SGA placental area was observed in 41(33.6%) cases, and among the SGA placental weight cases 12(48%) were also SGA fetal weight. Preterm birth (PTB) occurred in 15.6%(19/122) of cases; perinatal death in 4.1%(5/122) and HIV vertical transmission in 6 of 122 (4.9%). Women, ≥36 years old, were 5.7 times more likely to have PTB than those under 36. Also, patients with AIDS-defining criteria were 3.7 times more likely to have PTB. Prenatal care was inversely associated with PTB. Statistically significant associations were observed between AGA placental area and Protease Inhibitor usage and between SGA placental weight and SGA area. We found a prevalence of placental growth disorders in HIV-infected pregnant women and values higher than international reference values. The restriction of placental growth was a common disorder, possibly attributed to virus effects or a combination of antiretroviral regimens."
https://openalex.org/W3020981685,"Kallistatin is an inhibitor of tissue kallikrein and also inhibits the Wnt pathway. Its role in diabetic nephropathy (DN) is uncertain. Here we reported that serum kallistatin levels were significantly increased in diabetic patients with DN compared to those in diabetic patients without DN and healthy controls, and positively correlated with urinary albumin excretion. In addition, renal kallistatin levels were significantly upregulated in mouse models of type 1 (Akita, OVE26) and type 2 diabetes (db/db). To unveil the effects of kallistatin on DN and its underlying mechanism, we crossed transgenic mice overexpressing kallistatin with OVE26 mice (KS-tg/OVE). Kallistatin overexpression exacerbated albuminuria, renal fibrosis, inflammation, and oxidative stress in diabetes. Kallikrein activity was inhibited while the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) upregulated in the kidney of KS-tg/OVE mice compared to WT/OVE mice, suggesting a disturbed balance between the RAS and kallikrein-kinin systems. As shown by immunostaining of endothelial makers, renal vascular densities were decreased accompanied by increased HIF-1α and erythropoietin levels in the kidneys of KS-tg/OVE mice. Taken together, high levels of kallistatin exacerbate DN at least partly by inducing RAS overactivation and hypoxia. The present study demonstrated a positive correlation between kallistatin levels and DN, suggesting a potential biomarker for prognosis of DN."
https://openalex.org/W3022000392,"Despite being one of the most common measures of development, the Human Development Index [HDI] has been much criticized for its consistency, data requirements, difficulty of interpretation and trade-offs between indicators. The 'Human Life Indicator' [HLI] has been proposed as a 'simple effective means' of measuring development and, more specifically, as a viable alternative to the HDI. Reducing inequalities within countries is a core component of the Sustainable Development Goals; yet sub-national HDIs are subject to the same criticisms as national level indices (potentially more so). Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate 'proof of concept' in terms of the systematic application of the HLI to measure development at the subnational level. Using life tables for the United States of America, we calculate, for the first time, HLIs for each state for the period 1959-2016. This country was chosen for the comparatively long run of available sub-national life tables. We also calculate the extent to which mortality is distributed across the life course-a further measure of inequality and the role of the social determinants of health. The HLI clearly shows how striking regional inequalities exist across the United States. We find that HLI and HDI for the most recent time period are strongly correlated. The analysis demonstrates that HLI represents an effective means of measuring development at the sub-national level. Compared to HDI, HLIs are characterized by simpler calculation and interpretation; fewer data requirements; less measurement error; more consistency over time; and no trade-offs between components. A current challenge of producing sub-national HLIs is the lack of comprehensive civil registration and vital statistics systems in many parts of the Global South from which sub-national life tables can be generated. However, as more and more countries develop these systems the potential to produce HLIs will inevitably increase."
https://openalex.org/W3023699261,"While research on the effects of ‘birth month’ is usually referred to as relative age effects, the study of the effects of ‘birth year’ is described as the constituent year effect (CYE). In the present study we examined the impact of the CYE on participation in the Junior World Championship in alpine skiing. Based on previous research, we expected to find increasing numbers of participants the older the age-group, and that the CYE would be stronger in the speed events compared to the technical ones. The sample in the present study consisted of 1188 male skiers and 859 female skiers within the age range of 17 to 21 years at the time of competition. The results show that the number of male participants increased with increasing age, which can be described as a CYE. For female skiers, a CYE was found, but it dissipated two years earlier than for male skiers. The CYE varied with event and was more pronounced the higher the speed of the event. The findings thus suggest that a constituent year effect exists among skiers participating in the FIS Junior World Ski Championship in the alpine skiing championships, and that the effect varies with gender and event, rather unrelated to age. Thus, it seems that the effect may not be a relative age effect, but instead a relative development effect."

Helpful tests for assessment of instabilities include the sister chromatid exchange assay, identification of fragile sites, the bleomycin assay and the comet assay. These techniques can be used to assess and compare the chromosome stability of individual breeds of animals. The aim of the study was to assess chromosome stability in boars: Duroc, Duroc x Pietrain and Pietrain x Duroc crossbreds, Polish Large White, and the Neckar, P76 and PIC lines. The study assessed the chromosome stability of boars. The distribution of instabilities in individual breeds was varied. The average frequency of chromatid exchange was 4.8 ± 1.5, while that of fragile sites was 3.9 ± 1.4. The mean level of DNA damage (% tail DNA) was 9.4 ± 8.3, while in the bleomycin assay b/c and %AM were 0.6 ± 0.7 and 44.4 ± 4.1. A higher rate of instability was found in older individuals than in younger ones. The cytogenetic assays used to identify various forms of chromosome instability can be used to evaluate boars intended for breeding."
https://openalex.org/W3023340546,"Faces are one of the most important stimuli that we encounter, but humans vary dramatically in their behavior when viewing a face: some individuals preferentially fixate the eyes, others fixate the mouth, and still others show an intermediate pattern. The determinants of these large individual differences are unknown. However, individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) spend less time fixating the eyes of a viewed face than controls, suggesting the hypothesis that autistic traits in healthy adults might explain individual differences in face viewing behavior. Autistic traits were measured in 98 healthy adults recruited from an academic setting using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient, a validated 50-statement questionnaire. Fixations were measured using a video-based eye tracker while participants viewed two different types of audiovisual movies: short videos of talker speaking single syllables and longer videos of talkers speaking sentences in a social context. For both types of movies, there was a positive correlation between Autism-Spectrum Quotient score and percent of time fixating the lower half of the face that explained from 4% to 10% of the variance in individual face viewing behavior. This effect suggests that in healthy adults, autistic traits are one of many factors that contribute to individual differences in face viewing behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3023910164,"Poxviruses are large enveloped viruses that replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm. Like all viruses, their replication cycle begins with virion adsorption to the cell surface. Unlike most other viral families, however, no unique poxviral receptor has ever been identified. In the absence of a unique receptor, poxviruses are instead thought to adhere to the cell surface primarily through electrostatic interactions between the positively charged viral envelope proteins and the negatively charged sulfate groups on cellular glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). While these negatively charged GAGs are an integral part of all eukaryotic membranes, their specific expression and sulfation patterns differ between cell types. Critically, while poxviral binding has been extensively studied using virally centered genetic strategies, the impact of cell-intrinsic changes to GAG charge has never been examined. Here we show that loss of heparin sulfation, accomplished by deleting the enzyme N-Deacetylase and N-Sulfotransferase-1 (NDST1) which is essential for GAG sulfation, significantly reduces the binding affinity of both vaccinia and myxoma viruses to the cell surface. Strikingly, however, while this lowered binding affinity inhibits the subsequent spread of myxoma virus, it actually enhances the overall spread of vaccinia by generating more diffuse regions of infection. These data indicate that cell-intrinsic GAG sulfation plays a major role in poxviral infection, however, this role varies significantly between different members of the poxviridae."
https://openalex.org/W3020992771,"In older age, learning and feedback processing are usually impaired. This is thought to be due to impairments in the dopaminergic system and the anterior cingulate cortex. By contrast, processing of affective information seems to remain relatively intact. Recent research has also demonstrated that cognitive functioning can be influenced by affective materials or contexts and lead to an enhancement in diverse cognitive tasks. Hence, the aim of the present study was to explore, whether emotional feedback would counteract age-related learning deficits and strengthen early and later phases of feedback processing as reflected in the feedback-related negativity (FRN) and P3b of the event-related potential (ERP). Younger and older participants conducted a probabilistic reinforcement learning task in which the accurate responses had to be learned via feedback. In emotional trials, feedback stimuli consisted of faces with smiling and disgusted expressions, and in a non-emotional condition, positive and negative feedback was indicated by the background color of faces with neutral expressions. Our main results were that older adults showed better learning performance in the emotional feedback condition and a larger P3b after emotional than non-emotional feedback indexing heightened working memory updating after task relevant events."
https://openalex.org/W3021442188,"The magnitude and distribution of genetic diversity through space and time can provide useful information relating to evolutionary potential and conservation status in threatened species. In assessing genetic diversity in species that are of conservation concern, several studies have focused on the use of Toll-like receptors (TLRs). TLRs are innate immune genes related to pathogen resistance, and polymorphisms may reflect not only levels of functional diversity, but may also be used to assess genetic diversity within and among populations. Here, we combined four potentially adaptive markers (TLRs) with one mitochondrial (COI) marker to evaluate genetic variation in the endangered Sierra Madre Sparrow (Xenospiza baileyi). This species offers an ideal model to investigate population and evolutionary genetic processes that may be occurring in a habitat restricted endangered species with disjunct populations (Mexico City and Durango), the census sizes of which differ by an order of magnitude. TLRs diversity in the Sierra Madre Sparrow was relatively high, which was not expected given its two small, geographically isolated populations. Genetic diversity was different (but not significantly so) between the two populations, with less diversity seen in the smaller Durango population. Population genetic structure between populations was due to isolation and different selective forces acting on different TLRs; population structure was also evident in COI. Reduction of genetic diversity in COI was observed over 20 years in the Durango population, a result likely caused by habitat loss, a factor which may be the main cause of diversity decline generally. Our results provide information related to the ways in which adaptive variation can be altered by demographic changes due to human-mediated habitat alterations. Furthermore, our findings may help to guide conservation schemes for both populations and their restricted habitat."
https://openalex.org/W3021660025,"Objectives 
We previously reported microvascular leakage resulting from fibrinogen-γ chain C-terminal products (γC) occurred via a RhoA-dependent mechanism. The objective of this study was to further elucidate the signaling mechanism by which γC induces endothelial hyperpermeability. Since it is known that γC binds and activates endothelial αvβ3, a transmembrane integrin receptor involved in intracellular signaling mediated by the tyrosine kinases FAK and Src, we hypothesized that γC alters endothelial barrier function by activating the FAK-Src pathway leading to junction dissociation and RhoA driven cytoskeletal stress-fiber formation.


Methods and results 
Using intravital microscopy of rat mesenteric microvessels, we show increased extravasation of plasma protein (albumin) resulting from γC administration. In addition, capillary fluid filtration coefficient (Kfc) indicated γC-induced elevated lung vascular permeability. Furthermore, γC decreased transendothelial barrier resistance in a time-dependent and dose-related fashion in cultured rat lung microvascular endothelial cells (RLMVECs), accompanied by increased FAK/Src phosphorylation detection by western blot. Experiments with pharmacological inhibition or gene silencing of FAK showed significantly reduced γC-induced albumin and fluid leakage across microvessels, stress-fiber formation, VE-cadherin tyrosine phosphorylation, and improved γC-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction, indicating the involvement of FAK in γC mediated hyperpermeability. Comparable results were found when Src was targeted in a similar manner, however inhibition of FAK prevented Src activation, suggesting that FAK is upstream of Src in γC-mediated hyperpermeability. In addition, γC-induced cytoskeletal stress-fiber formation was attenuated during inhibition or silencing of these tyrosine kinases, concomitantly with RhoA inhibition.


Conclusion 
The FAK-Src pathway contributes to γC-induced microvascular barrier dysfunction, junction protein phosphorylation and disorganization in a manner that involves RhoA and stress-fiber formation."
https://openalex.org/W3022413625,"Microbial source tracking and a mass balance approach were used to identify sources of fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) in the Hanalei River, Kaua’i, Hawai’i. Historically, concentrations enterococci and Clostridium perfringens were significantly higher during storm flows compared to non-storm flows in the Hanalei River, and correlated to total suspended solids in the river. During targeted dry weather studies, the Hanalei River bed sediments and streambank soils were documented to harbor E. coli, enterococci, and the human- and pig-specific fecal markers in Bacteroidales, suggesting that sediments and soils may be potential sources of these microorganisms to the Hanalei river. The human-specific marker in Bacteroidales was four times as likely to be detected in sediment and soil samples as in water samples. Furthermore, the occurrence of host-specific source tracking markers is indicative that a portion of FIB present in the Hanalei River are of fecal origin. A mass balance approach was used to explore causes of observed FIB loadings and losses along different reaches of the river. Resuspension or deposition of FIB-laden river sediments cannot account for changes in E. coli and enterococci concentrations along the river during dry weather. Additionally, losses due to bacterial inactivation were insignificant. Groundwater and ditches draining agricultural and urban lands were shown to provide sufficient FIB fluxes to account for the observed loads along some river reaches. The presence of the human-specific Bacteroidales marker in the river water, sediments and adjacent soils, as well as the presence of the human enterovirus marker in the water, suggests that there is widespread human fecal contamination in the Hanalei River that is likely a result of nearby wastewater disposal systems."

However, the current toolbox of gene regulatory tools for eukaryotic systems have been outpaced by those developed for simple, single-celled systems. Here, we engineered a set of gene regulatory tools by combining self-cleaving ribozymes with various upstream competing sequences that were designed to disrupt ribozyme self-cleavage. As a proof-of-concept, we were able to modulate GFP expression in mammalian cells, and then showed the feasibility of these tools in Drosophila embryos. For each system, the fold-reduction of gene expression was influenced by the location of the self-cleaving ribozyme/upstream competing sequence (i.e. 5' vs. 3' untranslated region) and the competing sequence used. Together, this work provides a set of genetic tools that can be used to tune gene expression across various eukaryotic systems."

However the lack of databases at the individual level and covering several years has limited the analysis of BSS users' behavior in the long term. This article gives a first detailed description of the temporal evolution of individual customers. Using a 5-year dataset covering 120,827 distinct year-long subscribers, we show the heterogeneous individual trajectories masked by the overall system stability. Users follow two main trajectories: about half remain in the system for at most one year, showing a low median activity (47 trips); the remaining half corresponds to more active users (median activity of 91 trips in their first year) that remain continuously active for several years (mean time = 2.9 years). We show that users from urban cores, middle-aged and male are over represented among these long-term users, which profit most from the BSS. This provides further support for the view that BSS mostly benefit the already privileged."

In Mozambique, reference values are known for young adults (18-24yo) but not yet established for a wider age range. Our study aimed to establish hematological, biochemical and immunological reference values for vaccine trials in Mozambican healthy adults with high-risk for HIV acquisition.A longitudinal cohort and site development study in Mozambique between November 2013 and 2014 enrolled 505 participants between 18 to 35 years old. Samples from these healthy participants, were analyzed to determine reference values. All volunteers included in the analysis were clinically healthy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B and C virus, and syphilis negative. Median and reference ranges were calculated for the hematological, biochemical and immunological parameters. Ranges were compared with other African countries, the USA and the US National Institute of Health (NIH) Division of AIDS (DAIDS) toxicity tables.A total of 505 participant samples were analyzed. Of these, 419 participants were HIV, hepatitis B and C virus and syphilis negative including 203 (48.5%) females and 216 (51.5%) males, with a mean age of 21 years. In the hematological parameters, we found significant differences between sex for erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH and MCHC as well as white blood cells, neutrophils and platelets: males had higher values than females. There were also significant differences in CD4+T cell values, 803 cells/μL in men versus 926 cells/μL in women. In biochemical parameters, men presented higher values than women for the metabolic, enzymatic and renal parameters: total and direct bilirubin, ALT and creatinine.This study has established reference values for healthy adults with high-risk for HIV acquisition in Mozambique. These data are helpful in the context of future clinical research and patient care and treatment for the general adult population in the Mozambique and underline the importance of region-specific clinical reference ranges."
https://openalex.org/W3023096538,"Introduction Intestinal atresia is a rare congenital affliction that is often associated with severe bacterial infections despite adequate neonatal surgery. Previous studies have focused on enteric nervous system variations. We hypothesized that epithelial systems (ES) may also be involved in the pathophysiology of postnatal disorders. Materials and methods Global gene expression was measured by transcriptomic analysis in a rat model of induced intestinal atresia. The analyses then focused on genes involved in ES (enterocytes and goblet cells). Rat fetus small intestines at various stages of development (ED15, ED17, ED19, and ED21, n = 22), were used as non-operated controls and compared to the upper and lower segments of rat fetus small intestines with an induced atresia (n = 14; ligature at ED18). The pattern of gene expression was then confirmed by histochemistry, electron microscopy, and RT-qPCR. Results From ED15 to ED21, the expression of several genes exhibited a physiological increase of ES markers, with a significant increase at the end of gestation. The operated embryos exhibited significantly higher variations of gene expression in the proximal segment than in the distal segment in terms of absorption and the epithelial barrier. An increase in goblet cells and markers was observed in the proximal segment compared to the controls. Conclusion Fetal intestinal obstruction accelerates maturation in the proximal segment and disrupts the intestinal wall in the distal segment, with a decrease in the number of mucosal cells. Moreover, the epithelial cells underwent significant changes, supporting the notion that intestinal disorders involve more than the ENS."
