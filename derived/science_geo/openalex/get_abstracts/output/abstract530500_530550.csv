https://openalex.org/W2143511252,"Resetting of the epigenome in human primordial germ cells (hPGCs) is critical for development. We show that the transcriptional program of hPGCs is distinct from that in mice, with co-expression of somatic specifiers and naive pluripotency genes TFCP2L1 and KLF4. This unique gene regulatory network, established by SOX17 and BLIMP1, drives comprehensive germline DNA demethylation by repressing DNA methylation pathways and activating TET-mediated hydroxymethylation. Base-resolution methylome analysis reveals progressive DNA demethylation to basal levels in week 5-7 in vivo hPGCs. Concurrently, hPGCs undergo chromatin reorganization, X reactivation, and imprint erasure. Despite global hypomethylation, evolutionarily young and potentially hazardous retroelements, like SVA, remain methylated. Remarkably, some loci associated with metabolic and neurological disorders are also resistant to DNA demethylation, revealing potential for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance that may have phenotypic consequences. We provide comprehensive insight on early human germline transcriptional network and epigenetic reprogramming that subsequently impacts human development and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2118017182,"Germ cells are vital for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next and for maintaining the continuation of species. Here, we analyze the transcriptome of human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions. Human PGCs show unique transcription patterns involving the simultaneous expression of both pluripotency genes and germline-specific genes, with a subset of them displaying developmental-stage-specific features. Furthermore, we analyze the DNA methylome of human PGCs and find global demethylation of their genomes. Approximately 10 to 11 weeks after gestation, the PGCs are nearly devoid of any DNA methylation, with only 7.8% and 6.0% of the median methylation levels in male and female PGCs, respectively. Our work paves the way toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2132744522,"Proteomics has proved invaluable in generating large-scale quantitative data; however, the development of systems approaches for examining the proteome in vivo has lagged behind. To evaluate protein abundance and localization on a proteome scale, we exploited the yeast GFP-fusion collection in a pipeline combining automated genetics, high-throughput microscopy, and computational feature analysis. We developed an ensemble of binary classifiers to generate localization data from single-cell measurements and constructed maps of ∼3,000 proteins connected to 16 localization classes. To survey proteome dynamics in response to different chemical and genetic stimuli, we measure proteome-wide abundance and localization and identified changes over time. We analyzed >20 million cells to identify dynamic proteins that redistribute among multiple localizations in hydroxyurea, rapamycin, and in an rpd3Δ background. Because our localization and abundance data are quantitative, they provide the opportunity for many types of comparative studies, single cell analyses, modeling, and prediction. VIDEO ABSTRACT."
https://openalex.org/W1585169926,"It is generally assumed that mRNAs undergoing translation are protected from decay. Here, we show that mRNAs are, in fact, co-translationally degraded. This is a widespread and conserved process affecting most genes, where 5′–3′ transcript degradation follows the last translating ribosome, producing an in vivo ribosomal footprint. By sequencing the ends of 5′ phosphorylated mRNA degradation intermediates, we obtain a genome-wide drug-free measurement of ribosome dynamics. We identify general translation termination pauses in both normal and stress conditions. In addition, we describe novel codon-specific ribosomal pausing sites in response to oxidative stress that are dependent on the RNase Rny1. Our approach is simple and straightforward and does not require the use of translational inhibitors or in vitro RNA footprinting that can alter ribosome protection patterns."

Clevers H. Coexistence of quiescent and active adult stem cells in mammals.Science. 2010; 327: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). In the mouse small intestine and colon, the simple columnar epithelium is rapidly renewed every 3 days. Genetic-inducible fate-mapping studies suggest that epithelial cells in the small intestine are replaced from at least two principal stem cell pools, comprising both rapidly cycling crypt-based columnar (CBC) Lgr5-expressing cells and slower cycling Bmi1-expressing stem cells situated at position +4 above the crypt base (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H.

In the small intestine, the stem cell markers Sox-9 and Hes1 are also expressed in actively cycling Lgr5+ cells, while Bmi-1, mTert, Hopx, and Lrig1 are expressed in relatively quiescent stem cells, confirming the existence of more than one stem cell pool (Fre et al., 2011Fre S.

Moreover, Lgr5+ cells are dispensable in the small intestine, with Bmi1+ stem cells able to regenerate Lgr5+ cells and their lineages (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G.

The epithelial lining of the colon is also comprised of a single layer of columnar epithelial cells, which are constantly renewed by a pool of committed stem cells. These colonic stem cells give rise to progeny that terminally differentiate into a number of lineages that include colonocytes, mucus-secreting goblet cells, and enteroendocrine cells. Most recent studies have suggested that colonic stem cells are located at the crypt base throughout the colon, and a number of markers for colon stem cells have been proposed, including Lgr5 (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H.

Blasco M.A. Sancho E. et al.Isolation and in vitro expansion of human colonic stem cells.Nat. Med. 2011; 17: 1225-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Lgr5 has been the best studied, with in vivo lineage tracing showing that Lgr5-expressing cells at the colonic crypt base are capable of self-renewal and able to differentiate into all three colonic lineages. In the colon, however, it has been more challenging to identify the stem cells that reside above the crypt base. Bmi1+ cells, for example, do not exist in the colon. Thus, it is not known whether more than one distinct stem cell pool exists in the colon. Tumors are postulated to arise from tissue stem or progenitor cells, but the relative contribution of different stem cell pools to tumorigenesis remains unknown (Barker et al., 2009Barker N. Ridgway R.A. van Es J.H. van de Wetering M. Begthel H. van den Born M. Danenberg E. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Clevers H. Crypt stem cells as the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer.Nature. 2009; 457: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). In addition, our current understanding of colon cancer is based on a model of clonal evolution, whereby early adenomas advance to invasive carcinomas through stepwise acquisition of mutations (Fearon and Vogelstein, 1990Fearon E.R. Vogelstein B. A genetic model for colorectal tumorigenesis.Cell. 1990; 61: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9999) Google Scholar). In rapidly proliferating tissues, such as the intestine or colon, however, this model of tumorigenesis implies that only stem cells are sufficiently long-lived to accumulate the requisite mutations. Indeed, the contribution of Lgr5+ stem cells to intestinal tumorigenesis has been demonstrated by the formation of adenomas upon targeted mutation of the Apc gene specifically in Lgr5+ cells (Barker et al., 2009Barker N. Ridgway R.A. van Es J.H. van de Wetering M. Begthel H. van den Born M. Danenberg E. Clarke A.R. Sansom O.J. Clevers H. Crypt stem cells as the cells-of-origin of intestinal cancer.Nature. 2009; 457: 608-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the contribution of additional Lgr5-negative stem cells to the cellular origin of both colonic and intestinal cancer has not been clarified. To determine if an Lgr5-negative stem cell contributes to colonic homeostasis and tumor initiation, we established a genetic fate-mapping system for labeling keratin-19 (Krt19)-expressing progenitor/stem cells. Cytokeratins are a multigene family of intermediate filaments, critical in the maintenance of the cytoskeleton but expressed in different lineages within the epithelium (Moll et al., 1982Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. The catalog of human cytokeratins: patterns of expression in normal epithelia, tumors and cultured cells.Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4529) Google Scholar). Cytokeratin 19 or Krt19 is the smallest known acid keratin (∼40 kDa), is epithelial specific, and is found in a broad range of epithelial tissues. In the gastrointestinal tract, Krt19 expression is restricted to the proliferating compartments of the stomach, small intestine, and colon, as well as the pancreatic ducts of the adult pancreas and the hepatobiliary ducts (Brembeck et al., 2001Brembeck F.H. Moffett J. Wang T.C. Rustgi A.K. The keratin 19 promoter is potent for cell-specific targeting of genes in transgenic mice.Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1720-1728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Krt19 is expressed in the stem cell zone of the hair follicle (Brembeck et al., 2001Brembeck F.H. Moffett J. Wang T.C. Rustgi A.K.

A CK19(CreERT) knockin mouse line allows for conditional DNA recombination in epithelial cells in multiple endodermal organs.Genesis. 2008; 46: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), is amplified in many solid tumors, and, as we demonstrate here, is expressed near the presumptive progenitor/stem cell zone of both the colon and intestine. More specifically, we examined Krt19 because it is expressed at position +4, extending up to the isthmus, thus allowing us to selectively label a population of cells that includes transit-amplifying cells, progenitors, and long-lived stem cells, yet excludes rapidly cycling CBC Lgr5+ stem cells. We compared Krt19+ cells above the crypt base to Lgr5+ CBC cells with respect to their response to epithelial injury and cancer-initiating ability. Krt19-expressing cells identify long-lived progenitors/stem cells distinct from Lgr5+ cells and additionally render Lgr5+ stem cells dispensable in both the colon and intestine. Under conditional loss of the Apc gene, Krt19+ stem cells also display cancer-initiating ability, yet are functionally distinct from Lgr5+ cancer-initiating cells by their relative radioresistance. To localize Krt19 mRNA and protein expression, we performed in situ hybridization for Krt19 mRNA and immunofluorescence staining for Krt19 protein. Krt19 RNA was completely absent from the colonic crypt base and was detected primarily in the isthmus (i.e., area of crypt narrowing) that included cells extending down near the presumptive crypt progenitor/stem cell zone (Figure 1A; Figure S1A). In contrast, Krt19 protein showed minimal overlap with Krt19 RNA and was localized predominantly in differentiated cells (Figure S1B). Similarly, in the intestine, Krt19 RNA was detected primarily in the isthmus, and not in the intestinal crypt base (Figures 1B and S1B), while Krt19 protein expression localized to differentiated cells of the intestinal villus (Figure S1D). We have previously reported a progenitor/stem cell marker in the stomach that similarly displayed a discrepancy in the pattern between RNA versus protein expression (Quante et al., 2010Quante M. Marrache F. Goldenring J.R. Wang T.C. TFF2 mRNA transcript expression marks a gland progenitor cell of the gastric oxyntic mucosa.Gastroenterology. 2010; 139: 2018-2027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), so we sought to examine whether Krt19 also marked a stem cell population. We developed a Krt19-BAC-mApple (Krt19-mApple) reporter mouse (Figure S1I), confirming that Krt19 gene expression was limited only to cells located well above the crypt base in both the colon (Figure 1C) and intestine (Figure 1D). Notably, the absence of both Krt19 mRNA and protein expression from the crypt base (Figures 1A–1D; Figures S1A–S1H) afforded us the unique opportunity to selectively label and compare a progenitor/stem cell pool situated above the crypt base (position +4) to the well described Lgr5+ CBC cells (Barker et al., 2007Barker N. van Es J.H. Kuipers J. Kujala P. van den Born M. Cozijnsen M. Haegebarth A. Korving J. Begthel H. Peters P.J. Clevers H. Identification of stem cells in small intestine and colon by marker gene Lgr5.Nature. 2007; 449: 1003-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (3945) Google Scholar) and the more recently reported Lrig1+ stem cells (Powell et al., 2012Powell A.E. Wang Y. Li Y. Poulin E.J. Means A.L. Washington M.K. Higginbotham J.N. Juchheim A. Prasad N. Levy S.E. et al.The pan-ErbB negative regulator Lrig1 is an intestinal stem cell marker that functions as a tumor suppressor.Cell. 2012; 149: 146-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) found at the crypt base. To identify an Lgr5-negative progenitor/stem cell pool in the colon, we established a genetic fate-mapping system for labeling Krt19. We generated a Krt19-BAC-CreERT2 (Krt19-CreERT) transgenic line (Figures S1J and S1K) that was crossed to R26-LacZ (R26-LacZ) and ROSA26-mT/mG (R26-mT/mG) reporters in order to perform genetic lineage tracing experiments in homeostasis, inflammation, and cancer. Shortly following tamoxifen induction, β-galactosidase+ (β-gal) cells were localized to the colonic crypt (Figure 1E) in a pattern identical to Krt19-expressing cells detected by in situ and Krt19-mApple+ cells detected using a Krt19-mApple transgenic reporter mouse. Twenty-four hours after tamoxifen, recombination was evident in the colonic isthmus, extending down to the +4 position, but distinctly above the crypt base (Figures 1G and S2A). One week following tamoxifen, recombined cells derived from Krt19+ cells extended downward to include Lgr5+ cells at the colonic crypt base (Figures 1G and S2A). Sixteen weeks post-induction, Krt19+ cells traced all epithelial cell lineages in the colon (Figures 1G and S2A), and completely labeled glands were detected without any loss of labeling beyond 52 weeks (Figure 1G; Figures S2A–S2D), consistent with Krt19 labeling long-lived stem cells. In vitro, two-photon florescence microscopy of colonic crypts isolated from Krt19- CreERT;R26-mT/mG mice 12 hr after a single dose of tamoxifen also revealed recombination (GFP+) in a number of Krt19-expressing cells above the crypt base (Figures 1I and 1J; n = 6, colon). These cells contained bona fide stem cells and gradually replaced all epithelial cells over 9–10 days (colon: Figures 1I and 1J). Similarly, in the intestine, genetic lineage tracing experiments revealed that shortly following tamoxifen induction, Krt19-labeled β-gal+ cells located clearly above the crypt base in the intestinal crypt (Figures 1K and S2E). These cells eventually traced all intestinal epithelial cell lineages, including Lgr5+ cells at the crypt base (Figure 1K; Figures S2E and S2F), and again, consistent with the labeling of long lived stem cells, we observed no loss of labeling beyond 52 weeks (Figures 1C and 1D). Furthermore, in intestinal enteroids grown in vitro, a few Krt19+ cells above the crypt base could be detected 12 hr following tamoxifen (Figures S2G–S2I; n = 4, intestine), and these cells expanded over 9–10 days to replace the entire crypt-villus column (Figures S2G–S2I). Single-cell culture of Krt19-mApple+ cells isolated from the intestine of Krt19-mApple reporter mice further confirmed the stem cell capacity of Krt19+ cells (Figure S2J) at ∼1% clonogenic efficiency compared to 5% for Lgr5-GFP+ cells. To measure the overlap of Krt19+ cells with Lgr5+ cells, we performed Krt19 in situ hybridization on colonic (Figure 2A) tissues of Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 mice. We confirmed that Krt19 mRNA expression was not detectable in CBC stem cells marked by Lgr5 and overlapped rarely with a very small subset of Lgr5-GFP-positive cells located much higher in the colonic crypt (average position +7) (Figure 2C). Similarly, Krt19 mRNA expression was not detectable in Lgr5+ CBCs in the intestine (Figure 2B) and again overlapped rarely with a very small subset of Lgr5-GFP-positive cells located much higher in the crypt (average position +7) (Figure 2C). The majority of Krt19+ cells were also distinct from Lgr5+ cells with respect to their proliferation status, as most Lgr5+ cells were located immediately below the proliferation zone, whereas Krt19+ cells predominated within the proliferation zone (∼12% Lgr5+/Ki67+ versus ∼50% Krt19+/Ki67+ cells) (Figures 2D–2F; Figures S3A–S3J). Importantly, when we generated Krt19-mApple;Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2 dual reporter mice, Krt19-mApple+/Lgr5-GFP+ double-positive cells were only detected in extremely rare cells located higher in the colonic crypt (Figure 2G) and comprised <0.05% of total epithelial cells and <6% of Lgr5-GFP+ cells as detected by FACS (Figures 2I and 2J; Figure S3K). Similarly, in the intestine, <0.01% of total epithelial cells and <5% of Lgr5-GFP+ cells were Krt19-mApple+/Lgr5-GFP+ double-positive cells as determined by imaging (Figure 2H) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis (Figures 2J and S3K). Thus, Krt19 and Lgr5 identify largely distinct populations (Figure 2K), with only rare overlap near the +7 cell region. Interestingly, RNA expression analysis revealed that the Krt19-mApple+/ Lgr5-GFP+ double-positive intestinal cells displayed significant enrichment for the known “+4” intestinal stem cell markers Bmi1, Hopx, and Lrig1, as well as the intestinal progenitor marker Dll1 (Figure 2L), whereas Lgr5-negative Krt19-mApple+ cells showed relatively low or undetectable levels of both “+4” stem cell and progenitor markers (Figure 2L). Remarkably, despite the heterogeneity of Krt19+ cells posing a potential confounding factor in this RNA expression analysis, we confirmed using microscopy that only rare Krt19+/Bmi1+ cells are detected in the crypts of Krt19-CreERT;ROSA26-Tomato mice crossed to Bmi1-GFP mice (Figure S3L). Thus, given the infrequent overlap of Krt19 and Lgr5, we sought to definitively distinguish between Krt19+ versus Lgr5+ cells. We generated Lgr5-DTR-EGFP;Krt19-CreERT;R26-Tomato mice to conditionally ablate Lgr5+ cells following administration of diphtheria toxin, as previously described (Tian et al., 2011Tian H. Biehs B. Warming S. Leong K.G. Rangell L. Klein O.D. de Sauvage F.J. A reserve stem cell population in small intestine renders Lgr5-positive cells dispensable.Nature. 2011; 478: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed at 24 hr following tamoxifen induction that Krt19-Tomato+ cells were located above the crypt base and were almost entirely distinct from Lgr5-GFP+ CBCs (Figures 3A and 3B ). Next, we administered diphtheria toxin (DT) 3 days prior to tamoxifen in order to ablate Lgr5+ cells before the start of Krt19 lineage tracing (Figure 3C). Interestingly, Krt19+ colonic stem cells continued to lineage trace in the colon and gave rise to new Lgr5-GFP+ cells when the diphtheria toxin was stopped (Figure 3D). Importantly, the efficiency of Krt19+ cell-lineage tracing was unchanged despite Lgr5+ cell ablation effectively eliminating both the Lgr5-GFP+ CBCs, as well as the rare “+4” Krt19-mApple+/Lgr5-GFP+ double-positive cell populations (Figure 3E). Similarly, Krt19+ cells in the intestine continued to lineage trace and display resiliency in the face of Lgr5-GFP+ cell ablation (Figure 3D). From these data, we conclude that Krt19+ lineage tracing in the intestine was not due to overlap with the Dll1+ progenitor population for several reasons. First, Dll1 RNA expression was predominantly detected within the rare “+4” Krt19-mApple+/Lgr5-GFP+ double-positive and Lgr5-GFP+ CBC populations, rather than within Krt19-mApple+ cells. Moreover, Dll1+ progenitors are reported to show no lineage tracing capacity when irradiated 2 weeks after tamoxifen (van Es et al., 2012van Es J.H. Sato T. van de Wetering M. Lyubimova A. Nee A.N. Gregorieff A. Sasaki N. Zeinstra L. van den Born M. Korving J. et al.Dll1+ secretory progenitor cells revert to stem cells upon crypt damage.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar) and, additionally, are unable to form intestinal enteroids in the absence of Wnt3a (van Es et al., 2012van Es J.H. Sato T. van de Wetering M. Lyubimova A. Nee A.N. Gregorieff A. Sasaki N. Zeinstra L. van den Born M. Korving J. et al.Dll1+ secretory progenitor cells revert to stem cells upon crypt damage.Nat. Cell Biol. 2012; 14: 1099-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). In contrast, Krt19+ cells formed intestinal enteroids in the absence of Wnt3a (Figures S4A–S4C) and also showed lineage tracing capacity in vivo when irradiated 2 weeks after tamoxifen (Figures 4K and 4L ). Krt19+ lineage tracing capacity was not due to overlap with Krt19+ transit-amplifying (TA) cells. We used 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) to target the rapidly proliferating TA cell population as previously described (Doetsch et al., 1999Doetsch F. Caillé I. Lim D.A. García-Verdugo J.M. Alvarez-Buylla A.

Krt19+ cells lineage traced with the same efficiency in both the colon and intestine regardless of TA cell ablation alone, or TA cell plus Lgr5+ cell ablation (Figures 3I and 3J). Taken together, these data prove that Krt19 identifies a novel Lgr5(−) Krt19-expressing potential stem cell population in both the colon and intestine. Interestingly, Krt19 and Lgr5 additionally label distinct cell populations during development. Using a newly generated, constitutive Krt19-BAC-CRE transgenic mouse, we observed that Krt19 marked the early gastrointestinal endoderm, raising the possibility that Krt19 may also label a stem cell population in development (Figures S5A–S5G). This is in contrast to Lgr5-GFP+ cells, which were first detected in the intestine as weakly GFP+ cells on post-natal day 5 (Figures S5H and S5I). Radiation injury initiates intestinal stem cell division during epithelial repair (May et al., 2008May R. Riehl T.E. Hunt C. Sureban S.M. Anant S. Houchen C.W.

USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), whereas Bmi1+ stem cells are radioresistant (Yan et al., 2012Yan K.S. Chia L.A. Li X. Ootani A. Su J. Lee J.Y. Su N. Luo Y. Heilshorn S.C. Amieva M.R. et al.The intestinal stem cell markers Bmi1 and Lgr5 identify two functionally distinct populations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to compare Krt19+ versus Lgr5+ stem cells with respect to their sensitivity to radiation. Krt19-CreERT;R26-LacZ and Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;R26-LacZ mice were irradiated (12 Gy) 24 hr following tamoxifen labeling of each cell population (Figure 4A). When Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;R26-LacZ mice were irradiated 24 hr after tamoxifen, absence of lineage tracing (Figures 4B and 4D; Figure S6A) immediately following and in the early post-radiation period confirmed that Lgr5+ cells were radiosensitive (Yan et al., 2012Yan K.S. Chia L.A. Li X. Ootani A. Su J. Lee J.Y. Su N. Luo Y. Heilshorn S.C. Amieva M.R. et al.The intestinal stem cell markers Bmi1 and Lgr5 identify two functionally distinct populations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2012; 109: 466-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar). Consistent with Lgr5+ cell radiosensitivity, we observed a loss of Lgr5-GFP expression immediately following radiation (Figure 4E). In contrast, radioresistant Krt19+ cells continued to lineage trace in irradiated Krt19-CreERT;R26-LacZ mice (Figures 4C and S6B), and we detected an increase in contiguously labeled Krt19+ crypts, consistent with crypt fission (Figure 4D) and stem cell expansion through symmetric division as previously described (Park et al., 1995Park H.S. Goodlad R.A. Wright N.A. Crypt fission in the small intestine and colon. A mechanism for the emergence of G6PD locus-mutated crypts after treatment with mutagens.Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1416-1427PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the conclusion that radioresistance of Krt19+ cells was due to the labeling of stem cells, rather than TA cells, was supported by our observations that targeting of TA cells with 5-FU prior to radiation did not alter the lineage tracing capacity of Krt19+ cells (Figures 4G and 4H). Krt19+ cells also showed longevity (>18 months) well beyond the 2 week life span of Dll1+ progenitors and, importantly, showed lineage tracing capacity even when irradiated 2 weeks following tamoxifen induction (Figures S6E and S6F). To confirm our in vivo observations, we examined the effects of radiation on intestinal enteroid growth and stem cell function in vitro (Figure 4I). Following 10 Gy irradiation, intestinal enteroids from Krt19-mApple+/Lgr5-GFP+ dual reporter mice showed a marked reduction in Lgr5-GFP+ stem cells associated with the loss of crypt budding, suggesting crypt injury (Figures 4I and 4J). In contrast, the same enteroids showed that Krt19-mApple-expressing cells remained radioresistant and survived radiation injury. Indeed, during the regenerative state post-radiation, newly budding crypts arose from radioresistant Krt19-mApple-labeled cells (Figure 4J). These data again confirmed our in vivo observations that Krt19+ cells show relative radioresistance when compared to Lgr5+ stem cells. Recently, it was shown that interconversion can occur between Hopx+ and Lgr5+ cells in vitro (Takeda et al., 2011Takeda N. Jain R. LeBoeuf M.R. Wang Q. Lu M.M. Epstein J.A. Interconversion between intestinal stem cell populations in distinct niches.Science. 2011; 334: 1420-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) and that Dll1+ progenitors can also revert back to an Lgr5+ state in vitro (van Es et al., 2012van Es J.H.

https://openalex.org/W1580557214,"Understanding the factors that delineate the efficacy of T cell responses towards pathogens is crucial for our ability to develop potent therapies against infectious diseases. Multidimensional evaluation of T cell functionality at the single-cell level enables exhaustive analysis of combinatorial functional properties, hence polyfunctionality. We have recently invented an algorithm that quantifies polyfunctionality, the Polyfunctionality Index (Larsen et al. PLoS One 2012). Here we demonstrate that quantitative assessment of T cell polyfunctionality correlates with T cell efficacy measured as the capacity to kill target cells in vitro and control infection in vivo.We employed the polyfunctionality index on two datasets selected for their unique ability to evaluate the polyfunctional imprint on T cell efficacy. 1) HIV-specific CD8+ T cells and 2) Leishmania major-specific CD4+ T cells were analysed for their capacity to secrete multiple effector molecules, kill target cells and control infection. Briefly, employing the Polyfunctionality Index algorithm we determined the parameter estimates resulting in optimal correlation between T cell polyfunctionality and T cell efficacy.T cell polyfunctionality is correlated with T cell efficacy measured as 1) target killing (r=0.807, P<0.0001) and 2) lesion size upon challenge with Leishmania major (r=-0.50, P=0.004). Contrary to an approach relying on the Polyfunctionality Index algorithm, quantitative evaluation of T cell polyfunctionality traditionally ignores the gradual contribution of more or less polyfunctional T cells. Indeed, comparing both approaches we show that optimal description of T cell efficacy is obtained when gradually integrating all levels of polyfunctionality in accordance with the Polyfunctionality Index.Our study presents a generalizable methodology to objectively evaluate the impact of polyfunctionality on T cell efficacy. We show that T cell polyfunctionality is a superior correlate of T cell efficacy both in vitro and in vivo as compared with response size. Therefore, future immunotherapies should aim to increase T cell polyfunctionality."

https://openalex.org/W639723229,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth common cancer. The differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) has been associated with the prognosis of various cancers. However, limited information is available regarding genome-wide miRNA expression profiles in HCC to generate a tumor-specific miRNA signature of prognostic values. In this study, the miRNA profiles in 327 HCC patients, including 327 tumor and 43 adjacent non-tumor tissues, from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) were analyzed. The associations of the differentially expressed miRNAs with patient survival and other clinical characteristics were examined with t-test and Cox proportional regression model. Finally, a tumor-specific miRNA signature was generated and examined with Kaplan–Meier survival, univariate\multivariate Cox regression analyses and KEGG pathway analysis. Results showed that a total of 207 miRNAs were found differentially expressed between tumor and adjacent non-tumor HCC tissues. 78 of them were also discriminatively expressed with gender, race, tumor grade and AJCC tumor stage. Seven miRNAs were significantly associated with survival (P value <0.001). Among the seven significant miRNAs, six (hsa-mir-326, hsa-mir-3677, hsa-mir-511-1, hsa-mir-511-2, hsa-mir-9-1, and hsa-mir-9-2) were negatively associated with overall survival (OS), while the remaining one (hsa-mir-30d) was positively correlated. A tumor-specific 7-miRNAs signature was generated and validated as an independent prognostic predictor. Collectively, we have identified and validated an independent prognostic model based on the expression of seven miRNAs, which can be used to assess patients’ survival. Additional work is needed to translate our model into clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W1925493900,"Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from pancreatic β-cells requires an increase in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]). Glucose uptake into β-cells promotes Ca2+ influx and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In other cell types, Ca2+ and ROS jointly induce Ca2+ release mediated by ryanodine receptor (RyR) channels. Therefore, we explored here if RyR-mediated Ca2+ release contributes to GSIS in β-cell islets isolated from male rats. Stimulatory glucose increased islet insulin secretion, and promoted ROS generation in islets and dissociated β-cells. Conventional PCR assays and immunostaining confirmed that β-cells express RyR2, the cardiac RyR isoform. Extended incubation of β-cell islets with inhibitory ryanodine suppressed GSIS; so did the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), which also decreased insulin secretion induced by glucose plus caffeine. Inhibitory ryanodine or NAC did not affect insulin secretion induced by glucose plus carbachol, which engages inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. Incubation of islets with H2O2 in basal glucose increased insulin secretion 2-fold. Inhibitory ryanodine significantly decreased H2O2-stimulated insulin secretion and prevented the 4.5-fold increase of cytoplasmic [Ca2+] produced by incubation of dissociated β-cells with H2O2. Addition of stimulatory glucose or H2O2 (in basal glucose) to β-cells disaggregated from islets increased RyR2 S-glutathionylation to similar levels, measured by a proximity ligation assay; in contrast, NAC significantly reduced the RyR2 S-glutathionylation increase produced by stimulatory glucose. We propose that RyR2-mediated Ca2+ release, induced by the concomitant increases in [Ca2+] and ROS produced by stimulatory glucose, is an essential step in GSIS."

The governing partial differential equations for momentum, energy, micro rotation and nano-particles concentration are presented. Similarity transformations are utilized to convert the system of partial differential equations into system of ordinary differential equations. The reduced equations are solved analytically with the help of optimal homotopy analysis method (OHAM). Analytical solutions for velocity, temperature, micro-rotation and concentration profiles are expressed graphically against various emerging physical parameters. Physical quantities of interest such as skin friction co-efficient, local heat and local mass fluxes are also computed both analytically and numerically through mid-point integration scheme. It is found that both the solutions are in excellent agreement. Local skin friction coefficient is found to be higher for the case of strong concentration i.e. n=0, as compared to the case of weak concentration n=0.50. Influence of strong and weak concentration on Nusselt and Sherwood number appear to be similar in a quantitative sense."

Osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease with high prevalence among older people, and rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune inflammatory disease, both lead to irreversible structural and functional damage to articular cartilage. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of polyphenols such as catechin, quercetin, epigallocatechin gallate, and tannic acid, on crosslinking type II collagen and the roles of these agents in managing in vivo articular cartilage degradation. The thermal, enzymatic, and physical stability of bovine articular cartilage explants following polyphenolic treatment were assessed for efficiency. Epigallocatechin gallate and tannic acid-treated explants showed >12 °C increase over native cartilage in thermal stability, thereby confirming cartilage crosslinking. Polyphenol-treated cartilage also showed a significant reduction in the percentage of collagen degradation and the release of glycosaminoglycans against collagenase digestion, indicating the increase physical integrity and resistance of polyphenol crosslinked cartilage to enzymatic digestion. To examine the in vivo cartilage protective effects, polyphenols were injected intra-articularly before (prophylactic) and after (therapeutic) the induction of collagen-induced arthritis in rats. The hind paw volume and histomorphological scoring was done for cartilage damage. The intra-articular injection of epigallocatechin gallate and tannic acid did not significantly influence the time of onset or the intensity of joint inflammation. However, histomorphological scoring of the articular cartilage showed a significant reduction in cartilage degradation in prophylactic- and therapeutic-groups, indicating that intra-articular injections of polyphenols bind to articular cartilage and making it resistant to degradation despite ongoing inflammation. These studies establish the value of intra-articular injections of polyphenol in stabilization of cartilage collagen against degradation and indicate the unique beneficial role of injectable polyphenols in protecting the cartilage in arthritic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1541382290,"Throughout history and within numerous disciplines, there exists a perennial debate about how societies should best be organized. Should they emphasize individual freedom and autonomy or security and constraint? Contrary to proponents who tout the benefits of one over the other, we demonstrate across 32 nations that both freedom and constraint exhibit a curvilinear relationship with many indicators of societal well-being. Relative to moderate nations, very permissive and very constrained nations exhibit worse psychosocial outcomes (lower happiness, greater dysthymia, higher suicide rates), worse health outcomes (lower life expectancy, greater mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and diabetes) and poorer economic and political outcomes (lower gross domestic product per capita, greater risk for political instability). This supports the notion that a balance between freedom and constraint results in the best national outcomes. Accordingly, it is time to shift the debate away from either constraint or freedom and focus on both in moderation."
https://openalex.org/W2235083825,"Previously, we demonstrated that the highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (HP-PRRSV) HuN4 strain causes obvious thymic atrophy and thymocytes apoptosis in infected piglets after birth, which is more severe than that induced by classical PRRSV. In this study, we investigated apoptosis and autophagy in the thymus of piglets infected with the HP-PRRSV HuN4 strain, and found that both apoptosis and autophagy occurred in the thymus of piglets infected with HP-PRRSV. In addition to a few virus-infected cells, CD14+ cells, the main autophagic cells in the thymus were thymic epithelial cells. These findings demonstrated that HP-PRRSV induces apoptosis in bystander cells, and induces autophagy in both infected and bystander cells in the thymus of infected piglets. Herein, we first present new data on the thymic lesions induced by HP-PRRSV, and show that apoptosis and autophagy are key mechanisms involved in cell survival and determinants of the severity of thymic atrophy in infected piglets. Finally, future studies of the mechanism underlying immune responses are proposed based on our current understanding of PRRSV-host interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1524339949,"Most cases of congenital obstructive nephropathy are the result of ureteropelvic junction obstructions, and despite their high prevalence, we have a poor understanding of their etiology and scarcity of genetic models. The eight-protein exocyst complex regulates polarized exocytosis of intracellular vesicles in a large variety of cell types. Here we report generation of a conditional knockout mouse for Sec10, a central component of the exocyst, which is the first conditional allele for any exocyst gene. Inactivation of Sec10 in ureteric bud-derived cells using Ksp1.3-Cre mice resulted in severe bilateral hydronephrosis and complete anuria in newborns, with death occurring 6-14 hours after birth. Sec10 FL/FL;Ksp-Cre embryos developed ureteropelvic junction obstructions between E17.5 and E18.5 as a result of degeneration of the urothelium and subsequent overgrowth by surrounding mesenchymal cells. The urothelial cell layer that lines the urinary tract must maintain a hydrophobic luminal barrier again urine while remaining highly stretchable. This barrier is largely established by production of uroplakin proteins that are transported to the apical surface to establish large plaques. By E16.5, Sec10 FL/FL;Ksp-Cre ureter and pelvic urothelium showed decreased uroplakin-3 protein at the luminal surface, and complete absence of uroplakin-3 by E17.5. Affected urothelium at the UPJ showed irregular barriers that exposed the smooth muscle layer to urine, suggesting this may trigger the surrounding mesenchymal cells to overgrow the lumen. Findings from this novel mouse model show Sec10 is critical for the development of the urothelium in ureters, and provides experimental evidence that failure of this urothelial barrier may contribute to human congenital urinary tract obstructions."
https://openalex.org/W617354880,"In the natural and technological world, multi-agent systems strongly depend on how the interactions are ruled between their individual components, and the proper control of time-scales and synchronization is a key issue. This certainly applies to living tissues when multicellular assemblies such as epithelial cells achieve complex morphogenetic processes. In epithelia, because cells are known to individually generate actomyosin contractile stress, each individual intercellular adhesive junction line is subjected to the opposed stresses independently generated by its two partner cells. Contact lines should thus move unless their two partner cells mechanically match. The geometric homeostasis of mature epithelia observed at short enough time-scale thus raises the problem to understand how cells, if considered as noisy individual actuators, do adapt across individual intercellular contacts to locally balance their time-average contractile stress. Structural components of adherens junctions, cytoskeleton (F-actin) and homophilic bonds (E-cadherin) are quickly renewed at steady-state. These turnovers, if they depend on forces exerted at contacts, may play a key role in the mechanical adaptation of epithelia. Here we focus on E-cadherin as a force transducer, and we study the local regulation and the mechanosensitivity of its turnover in junctions. We show that E-cadherin turnover rates match remarkably well on either side of mature intercellular contacts, despite the fact that they exhibit large fluctuations in time and variations from one junction to another. Using local mechanical and biochemical perturbations, we find faster turnover rates with increased tension, and asymmetric rates at unbalanced junctions. Together, the observations that E-cadherin turnover, and its local symmetry or asymmetry at each side of the junction, are mechanosensitive, support the hypothesis that E-cadherin turnover could be involved in mechanical homeostasis of epithelia."

Momentum to prioritize under-nutrition has been growing at an international level, as demonstrated by the ""Scaling Up Nutrition"" movement. Low body mass index is an important risk factor for developing TB disease. The objective of this study was to project future trends in TB related outcomes under different scenarios for reducing under-nutrition in the adult population in the Central Eastern states of India.A compartmental TB transmission model stratified by body mass index was parameterized using national and regional data from India. We compared TB related mortality and incidence under several scenarios that represented a range of policies and programs designed to reduce the prevalence of under-nutrition, based on the experience and observed trends in similar countries.The modeled nutrition intervention scenarios brought about reductions in TB incidence and TB related mortality in the Central Eastern Indian states ranging from 43% to 71% and 40% to 68% respectively, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention. Modest reductions in under-nutrition averted 4.8 (95% UR 0.5, 17.1) million TB cases and 1.6 (95% UR 0.5, 5.2) million TB related deaths over a period of 20 years of intervention, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention. Complete elimination of under-nutrition in the Central Eastern states averted 9.4 (95% UR 1.5, 30.6) million TB cases and 3.2 (95% UR 0.7-, 10.1) million TB related deaths, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention.Our study suggests that intervening on under-nutrition could have a substantial impact on TB incidence and mortality in areas with high prevalence of under-nutrition, even if only small gains in under-nutrition can be achieved. Focusing on under-nutrition may be an effective way to reduce both rates of TB and other diseases associated with under-nutrition."
https://openalex.org/W1961071389,"Currently licensed influenza vaccines mainly induce antibodies against highly variable epitopes. Due to antigenic drift, protection is subtype or strain-specific and regular vaccine updates are required. In case of antigenic shifts, which have caused several pandemics in the past, completely new vaccines need to be developed. We set out to develop a vaccine that provides protection against a broad range of influenza viruses. Therefore, highly conserved parts of the influenza A virus (IAV) were selected of which we constructed antibody and T cell inducing peptide-based vaccines. The B epitope vaccine consists of the highly conserved HA2 fusion peptide and M2e peptide coupled to a CD4 helper epitope. The T epitope vaccine comprises 25 overlapping synthetic long peptides of 26-34 amino acids, thereby avoiding restriction for a certain MHC haplotype. These peptides are derived from nucleoprotein (NP), polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1) and matrix protein 1 (M1). C57BL/6 mice, BALB/c mice, and ferrets were vaccinated with the B epitopes, 25 SLP or a combination of both. Vaccine-specific antibodies were detected in sera of mice and ferrets and vaccine-specific cellular responses were measured in mice. Following challenge, both mice and ferrets showed a reduction of virus titers in the lungs in response to vaccination. Summarizing, a peptide-based vaccine directed against conserved parts of influenza virus containing B and T cell epitopes shows promising results for further development. Such a vaccine may reduce disease burden and virus transmission during pandemic outbreaks."
https://openalex.org/W1571614320,"We tested whether a high fat diet (HFD) containing the inflammatory dietary fatty acid palmitate or insulin deficient diabetes altered the remodeling of atherosclerotic plaques in LDL receptor knockout (Ldlr-/-) mice. Cholesterol reduction was achieved by using a helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) carrying the gene for the low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr; HDAd-LDLR). After injection of the HDAd-LDLR, mice consuming either HFD, which led to insulin resistance but not hyperglycemia, or low fat diet (LFD), showed regression compared to baseline. However there was no difference between the two groups in terms of atherosclerotic lesion size, or CD68+ cell and lipid content. Because of the lack of effects of these two diets, we then tested whether viral-mediated cholesterol reduction would lead to defective regression in mice with greater hyperglycemia. In both normoglycemic and streptozotocin (STZ)-treated hyperglycemic mice, HDAd-LDLR significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels, decreased atherosclerotic lesion size, reduced macrophage area and lipid content, and increased collagen content of plaque in the aortic sinus. However, reductions in anti-inflammatory and ER stress-related genes were less pronounced in STZ-diabetic mice compared to non-diabetic mice. In conclusion, HDAd-mediated Ldlr gene therapy is an effective and simple method to induce atherosclerosis regression in Ldlr-/- mice in different metabolic states."

https://openalex.org/W1261805542,"After Chernobyl and Fukushima Daï Chi, two major nuclear accidents, large amounts of radionuclides were released in the environment, mostly caesium 137 (137Cs). Populations living in contaminated territories are chronically exposed to radionuclides by ingestion of contaminated food. However, questions still remain regarding the effects of low dose ionizing radiation exposure on the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. We therefore investigated the effects of a chronic internal exposure to 137Cs on atherosclerosis in predisposed ApoE-/- mice. Mice were exposed daily to 0, 4, 20 or 100 kBq/l 137Cs in drinking water, corresponding to range of concentrations found in contaminated territories, for 6 or 9 months. We evaluated plaque size and phenotype, inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress status in different experimental groups. Results did not show any differences in atherosclerosis progression between mice exposed to 137Cs and unexposed controls. However, 137Cs exposed mice developed more stable plaques with decreased macrophage content, associated with reduced aortic expression of pro-inflammatory factors (CRP, TNFα, MCP-1, IFNγ) and adhesion molecules (ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and E-selectin). Lesions of mice exposed to 137Cs were also characterized by enhanced collagen and smooth muscle cell content, concurrent with reduced matrix metalloproteinase MMP8 and MMP13 expression. These results suggest that low dose chronic exposure of 137Cs in ApoE-/- mice enhances atherosclerotic lesion stability by inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokine and MMP production, resulting in collagen-rich plaques with greater smooth muscle cell and less macrophage content."
https://openalex.org/W1578190835,"Although tuberculosis (TB) is usually curable with antibiotics, poor adherence to medication can lead to increased transmission, drug resistance, and death. Prior research has shown several factors to be associated with poor adherence, but this problem remains a substantial barrier to global TB control. We studied patients in a high-incidence district of Lima, Peru to identify factors associated with premature termination of treatment (treatment default).We conducted a prospective cohort study of adult smear-positive TB patients enrolled between January 2010 and December 2011 with no history of TB disease. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine risk factors associated with treatment default.Of the 1233 patients studied, 127 (10%) defaulted from treatment. Patients who defaulted were more likely to have used illegal drugs (OR = 4.78, 95% CI: 3.05-7.49), have multidrug-resistant TB (OR = 3.04, 95% CI: 1.58-5.85), not have been tested for HIV (OR = 2.30, 95% CI: 1.50-3.54), drink alcohol at least weekly (OR = 2.22, 95% CI: 1.40-3.52), be underweight (OR = 2.08, 95% CI: 1.21-3.56), or not have completed secondary education (OR = 1.55, 95% CI: 1.03-2.33).Our study identified several factors associated with defaulting from treatment, suggesting a complex set of causes that might lead to default. Addressing these factors individually would be difficult, but they might help to identify certain high-risk patients for supplemental intervention prior to treatment interruption. Treatment adherence remains a barrier to successful TB care and reducing the frequency of default is important for both the patients' health and the health of the community."
https://openalex.org/W1805128131,"Purpose The triterpene oleanolic acid (OA) is known to possess antihypertensive actions. In the present study we to compared the effects of the triterpene on mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and kidney function following acute administration in normotensive animals with those of its related oleanane synthetic derivatives (brominated oleanolic acid, Br-OA and oleanolic acid methyl ester, Me-OA). We also used experimental models of hypertension to further explore the effects of sub-chronic oral OA treatment and evaluated influences on oxidative status. Methods OA was extracted from dried flower buds of Syzygium aromaticum using a previously validated protocol in our laboratory. Me-OA and Br-OA were synthesized according to a method described. Rats were supplemented with lithium chloride (12 mmol L-1) prior to experimentation in order to raise plasma lithium to allow measurements of lithium clearance and fractional excretion (FELi) as indices of proximal tubular Na+ handling. Anaesthetized animals were continuously infused via the right jugular with 0.077M NaCl. MAP was measured via a cannula inserted in the carotid artery, and urine was collected through a cannula inserted in the bladder. After a 3.5 h equilibration, MAP, urine flow, electrolyte excretion rates were determined for 4 h of 1 h control, 1.5 h treatment and 1.5 h recovery periods. OA, Me-OA and Br-OA were added to the infusate during the treatment period. We evaluated sub-chronic effects on MAP and kidney function in normotensive Wistar rats and in two animal models of hypertension, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and Dahl salt-sensitive (DSS) rats, during 9-week administration of OA (p.o.). Tissue oxidative status was examined in these animals at the end of the study. Increasing evidence suggests that and renal function disturbances and oxidative stress play major roles in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Results Acute infusion OA and oleanane derivatives displayed qualitatively similar effects in decreasing MAP and increasing urinary Na+ outputs. The drugs increased the FENa and FELi without influencing GFR indicating that at least part of the overall natriuretic effect involved proximal tubular Na+ reabsorption. Sub-chronic OA administration (p.o.) also elicited hypotensive responses in Wistar, DSS and SHR rats. The MAP lowering effect was more marked in hypertensive animals and were positively correlated with increased urinary Na+ excretion. Compared with respective control rats, OA treatment reduced malondialdehyde (MDA, a marker of lipid peroxidation) and increased activities of antioxidant enzymes; superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in hepatic, cardiac and renal tissues. Conclusions OA and oleanane derivatives have similar effects on MAP, kidney function and oxidative stress. The amelioration of oxidative stress and blood pressure lowering effects by OA are more marked in hypertensive animals and correlated with an increased urinary Na+ output. Novelty of the Work The results of this study are novel in that they show 1) a correlation between blood pressure reduction and increased urinary Na+ excretion by OA, 2) a more marked MAP reduction in hypertensive animals and 3) a drug-induced decrease in proximal tubule Na+ reabsorption. The results may also be clinically relevant because OA is effective via oral administration."

However, the pathogenesis of equine neonatal hypocalcemia is poorly understood. Hypovitaminosis D in critically ill people has been linked to hypocalcemia and mortality; however, information on vitamin D metabolites and their association with clinical findings and outcome in critically ill foals is lacking. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (hypovitaminosis D) and its association with serum calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations, disease severity, and mortality in hospitalized newborn foals. Methods and Results One hundred newborn foals ≤72 hours old divided into hospitalized (n = 83; 59 septic, 24 sick non-septic [SNS]) and healthy (n = 17) groups were included. Blood samples were collected on admission to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3], 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH) 2D3], and PTH concentrations. Data were analyzed by nonparametric methods and univariate logistic regression. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis D [defined as 25(OH)D3 <9.51 ng/mL] was 63% for hospitalized, 64% for septic, and 63% for SNS foals. Serum 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH) 2D3 concentrations were significantly lower in septic and SNS compared to healthy foals (P<0.0001; P = 0.037). Septic foals had significantly lower calcium and higher phosphorus and PTH concentrations than healthy and SNS foals (P<0.05). In hospitalized and septic foals, low 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations were associated with increased PTH but not with calcium or phosphorus concentrations. Septic foals with 25(OH)D3 <9.51 ng/mL and 1,25(OH) 2D3 <7.09 pmol/L were more likely to die (OR=3.62; 95% CI = 1.1-12.40; OR = 5.41; 95% CI = 1.19-24.52, respectively). Conclusions Low 25(OH)D3 and 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations are associated with disease severity and mortality in hospitalized foals. Vitamin D deficiency may contribute to a pro-inflammatory state in equine perinatal diseases. Hypocalcemia and hyperphosphatemia together with decreased 1,25(OH)2D3 but increased PTH concentrations in septic foals indicates that PTH resistance may be associated with the development of these abnormalities."

It is known that heat and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) give structurally different states of RNase-A, lysozyme, α-chymotrypsinogen A and α-lactalbumin. On the contrary, differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) and isothermal titration calorimetric measurements, reported in the literature, led to the conclusion that heat denatured and GdmCl denatured states are thermodynamically and structurally identical. In order to resolve this controversy, we have measured changes in the far-UV CD (circular dichroism) of these heat-denatured proteins on the addition of different concentrations of GdmCl. The observed sigmoidal curve of each protein was analyzed for Gibbs free energy change in the absence of the denaturant (ΔG0X→D) associated with the process heat denatured (X) state ↔ GdmCl denatured (D) state. To confirm that this thermodynamic property represents the property of the protein alone and is not a manifestation of salvation effect, we measured urea-induced denaturation curves of these heat denatured proteins under the same experimental condition in which GdmCl-induced denaturation was carried out. In this paper we report that (a) heat denatured proteins contain secondary structure, and GdmCl (or urea) induces a cooperative transition between X and D states, (b) for each protein at a given pH and temperature, thermodynamic cycle connects quantities, ΔG0N→X (native (N) state ↔ X state), ΔG0X→D and ΔG0N→D (N state ↔ D state), and"

The association between SNPs of genes influencing bone mass and fluorosis has attracted attention, but the association of SNPs with the risk of brick-tea type of fluorosis has not been reported.To investigate the modifying roles of GSTP1 rs1695 polymorphisms on this association.A cross-sectional study was conducted. Brick-tea water was tested by the standard of GB1996-2005 (China). Urinary fluoride was tested by the standard of WS/T 89-2006 (China). Skeletal fluorosis was diagnosed by X-ray, the part we scheduled was forearm, shank, and pelvic, then diagnosed the skeletal fluorosis by the standard of WS/192-2008 (China). Gene polymorphism was tested by Sequenom MassARRAY system.The prevalence rate in different ethnical participants was different: Tibetan individuals had the highest prevalence rate of skeletal fluorosis. There were significant differences in genotype frequencies of GSTP1 Rs1695 among different ethnical participants (p<0.001): Tibetan, Mongolian and Han subjects with homozygous wild type (GSTP1-AA) genotype were numerically higher than Kazakh and Russian subjects (p<0.001). Compared to Tibetan participants who carried homozygous A allele of GSTP1 Rs1695, Tibetan participants who carried G allele had a significantly decreased risk of skeletal fluorosis (OR = 0.558 [95% CI, 0.326-0.955]). For Kazakh participants, a decreased risk of skeletal fluorosis among carriers of the G allele was limited to non high-loaded fluoride status (OR = 0. 166 [95% CI, 0.035-0.780] vs. OR = 1.478 [95% CI, 0.866-2.552] in participants with high-loaded fluoride status). Neither SNP-IF nor SNP-age for GSTP1 Rs1695 was observed.The prevalence rate of the brick tea type fluorosis might have ethnic difference. For Tibetan individuals, who had the highest prevalence rate, G allele of GSTP1 Rs1695 might be a protective factor for brick tea type skeletal fluorosis."

A fetal isolated short femur was defined as a femur length (FL) below the 5th percentile in a fetus with an abdominal circumference greater than the 10th percentile. Cases of aneuploidy, skeletal dysplasia and major anomalies were excluded. Primary outcomes of interest included the risk of small for gestational age neonates, low birth weight and preterm birth (PTB). Secondary outcome parameters were a 5-min Apgar score less than 7 and a neonatal intensive care unit admission. A control group of 200 fetuses with FL ≥ 5th percentile was used to compare primary and secondary outcome parameters within both groups. Chi-square and Student's t-tests were used where appropriate.Out of 608 eligible patients with a short FL, 117 met the inclusion criteria. Isolated short FL was associated with an increased risk for small for gestational age (19.7% versus 8.0%, p = 0.002) neonates, low birth weight (23.9% versus 8.5%, p<0.001), PTB (19.7% versus 6.0%, p<0.001) and neonatal intensive care unit admissions (13.7% versus 3.5%, p = 0.001). The incidence of a 5-min Apgar score less than 7 was similar in both groups.Isolated short FL is associated with a subsequent delivery of small for gestational age and Low birth weight neonates as well as an increased risk for PTB. This information should be considered when counseling patients after mid-trimester isolated short FL is diagnosed."

https://openalex.org/W2196804729,"Quantification of functional connectivity in physiological networks is frequently performed by means of time-variant partial directed coherence (tvPDC), based on time-variant multivariate autoregressive models. The principle advantage of tvPDC lies in the combination of directionality, time variance and frequency selectivity simultaneously, offering a more differentiated view into complex brain networks. Yet the advantages specific to tvPDC also cause a large number of results, leading to serious problems in interpretability. To counter this issue, we propose the decomposition of multi-dimensional tvPDC results into a sum of rank-1 outer products. This leads to a data condensation which enables an advanced interpretation of results. Furthermore it is thereby possible to uncover inherent interaction patterns of induced neuronal subsystems by limiting the decomposition to several relevant channels, while retaining the global influence determined by the preceding multivariate AR estimation and tvPDC calculation of the entire scalp. Finally a comparison between several subjects is considerably easier, as individual tvPDC results are summarized within a comprehensive model equipped with subject-specific loading coefficients. A proof-of-principle of the approach is provided by means of simulated data; EEG data of an experiment concerning visual evoked potentials are used to demonstrate the applicability to real data."
https://openalex.org/W1128977261,"Considerable progress has been made in the treatment of hearing loss with auditory implants. However, there are still many implanted patients that experience hearing deficiencies, such as limited speech understanding or vanishing perception with continuous stimulation (i.e., abnormal loudness adaptation). The present study aims to identify specific patterns of cerebral cortex activity involved with such deficiencies. We performed O-15-water positron emission tomography (PET) in patients implanted with electrodes within the cochlea, brainstem, or midbrain to investigate the pattern of cortical activation in response to speech or continuous multi-tone stimuli directly inputted into the implant processor that then delivered electrical patterns through those electrodes. Statistical parametric mapping was performed on a single subject basis. Better speech understanding was correlated with a larger extent of bilateral auditory cortex activation. In contrast to speech, the continuous multi-tone stimulus elicited mainly unilateral auditory cortical activity in which greater loudness adaptation corresponded to weaker activation and even deactivation. Interestingly, greater loudness adaptation was correlated with stronger activity within the ventral prefrontal cortex, which could be up-regulated to suppress the irrelevant or aberrant signals into the auditory cortex. The ability to detect these specific cortical patterns and differences across patients and stimuli demonstrates the potential for using PET to diagnose auditory function or dysfunction in implant patients, which in turn could guide the development of appropriate stimulation strategies for improving hearing rehabilitation. Beyond hearing restoration, our study also reveals a potential role of the frontal cortex in suppressing irrelevant or aberrant activity within the auditory cortex, and thus may be relevant for understanding and treating tinnitus."
https://openalex.org/W1955733588,"Psoriasis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease involving both environmental and genetic factors. According to genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the TNIP1 gene, which encodes the TNF-α-induced protein 3-interacting protein 1 (TNIP1), is strongly linked to the susceptibility of psoriasis. TNIP1 is a widely expressed ubiquitin sensor that binds to the ubiquitin-editing protein A20 and restricts TNF- and TLR-induced signals. In our study, TNIP1 expression decreased in specimens of epidermis affected by psoriasis. Based on previous studies suggesting a role for TNIP1 in modulating cancer cell growth, we investigated its role in keratinocyte proliferation, which is clearly abnormal in psoriasis. To mimic the downregulation or upregulation of TNIP1 in HaCaT cells and primary human keratinocytes (PHKs), we used a TNIP1 specific small interfering hairpin RNA (TNIP1 shRNA) lentiviral vector or a recombinant TNIP1 (rTNIP1) lentiviral vector, respectively. Blocking TNIP1 expression increased keratinocyte proliferation, while overexpression of TNIP1 decreased keratinocyte proliferation. Furthermore, we showed that TNIP1 signaling might involve extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (Erk1/2) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) activity. Intradermal injection of TNIP1 shRNA in BALB/c mice led to exaggerated psoriatic conditions in imiquimod (IMQ)-induced psoriasis-like dermatitis. These findings indicate that TNIP1 has a protective role in psoriasis and therefore could be a promising therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2135790960,"Longevity differs between sexes, with females being longer-lived in most mammals, including humans. One hallmark of aging is the functional decline of stem cells. Thus, a key question is whether the aging of stem cells differs between males and females and whether this has consequences for disease and lifespan. Longevity differs between sexes, with females being longer-lived in most mammals, including humans. One hallmark of aging is the functional decline of stem cells. Thus, a key question is whether the aging of stem cells differs between males and females and whether this has consequences for disease and lifespan. A glance at the list of the human individuals currently living over the age of 110—supercentenarians—reveals a surefire strategy for achieving such exceptional longevity: be female. Out of the 53 living supercentenarians, 51 are female. No other demographic factor comes remotely close to sex in predicting the likelihood of achieving such an advanced age. Sexual dimorphism with respect to longevity is a characteristic of most mammals and has been recorded in human populations since at least the mid-18th century. This dichotomous capacity for resilience has inspired wide-ranging hypotheses to explain the underlying mechanisms. It also raises questions regarding the sexual dimorphism of processes known to sustain tissue regeneration and function throughout life, including adult stem cell renewal. Most adult stem cell populations undergo an age-related decline, leading to dysfunctional tissue homeostasis, which most likely participates in defining the ultimate lifespan of the organism. Interestingly, sex-specific regulation of stem cell populations has been demonstrated for several stem cell types, and it has long been appreciated that many canonical aging pathways exhibit sex specificity. However, despite the seeming interrelationship between sex, stem cell maintenance, and aging, few studies have sought to directly explore the interaction of these three variables. Here we discuss the sexual dimorphism of adult stem cell populations and how processes regulating the aging of stem cells may also be modified by sex. Hypotheses to explain the sexual imbalance in longevity have come from divergent fields, including genetics, evolutionary biology, and physiology. One hypothesis is that the single X chromosome of males makes them functionally homozygous at all loci on that chromosome, potentially rendering them more susceptible to deleterious recessive traits. The maternal inheritance of mitochondria could also result in sexual dimorphism in the function of mitochondria, which could in turn impact metabolism and longevity. Evolutionary hypotheses have postulated that the sexes have adapted to be fit for different needs—for example, females put more investment in progeny production and care than males in most species—and that these different adaptive pressures could result in antagonistic selection at longevity associated loci. While these genetic hypotheses are difficult to test experimentally, the evolutionary forces at play have resulted in differential sex-associated phenotypes that may determine lifespan. Most notably, the differential utilization of steroid hormones, estrogen and testosterone (prominent determinants of sex-specific phenotypes), has been proposed to contribute to lifespan. Indeed, studies of human eunuchs (castrated males) have shown that their lifespan is about 14 years longer than non-castrated males (Min et al., 2012Min K.J. Lee C.K. Park H.N. Curr. Biol. 2012; 22: R792-R793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Furthermore, supplementation with estrogen increases the lifespan of male mice specifically (Fontana and Partridge, 2015Fontana L. Partridge L. Cell. 2015; 161: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which estrogen and testosterone modify lifespan have remained elusive. The sex of an organism can modify the behavior of its stem cell populations in a way that may be adaptive. A recent study has shown that hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are more abundant and more proliferative in female mice than in male mice, an effect that is dependent on estrogen signaling (Nakada et al., 2014Nakada D. Oguro H. Levi B.P. Ryan N. Kitano A. Saitoh Y. Takeichi M. Wendt G.R. Morrison S.J. Nature. 2014; 505: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The dependency on estrogen results in a further increase in HSC number and proliferation during pregnancy (Nakada et al., 2014Nakada D. Oguro H. Levi B.P. Ryan N. Kitano A. Saitoh Y. Takeichi M. Wendt G.R. Morrison S.J. Nature. 2014; 505: 555-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). A similar paradigm has been described in neural stem cells (NSCs), where estrogen increases the proliferation of NSCs in a transient manner that fluctuates throughout the estrus cycle (Pawluski et al., 2009Pawluski J.L. Brummelte S. Barha C.K. Crozier T.M. Galea L.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2009; 30: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). NSC proliferation is highest during the proestrus phase of the estrus cycle, when estrogen levels are particularly high. Exogenous administration of estrogen is also sufficient to increase the proliferation of NSCs in vivo (Pawluski et al., 2009Pawluski J.L. Brummelte S. Barha C.K. Crozier T.M. Galea L.A. Front. Neuroendocrinol. 2009; 30: 343-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In muscle, the resident stem cells, termed satellite cells (SCs), exhibit greater self-renewal and regenerative capacity in females than in their male counterparts (Deasy et al., 2007Deasy B.M. Lu A. Tebbets J.C. Feduska J.M. Schugar R.C. Pollett J.B. Sun B. Urish K.L. Gharaibeh B.M. Cao B. et al.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the enhanced regenerative capacity of female SCs does not appear to be related to estrogen signaling as is observed in other stem cell niches (Deasy et al., 2007Deasy B.M. Lu A. Tebbets J.C. Feduska J.M. Schugar R.C. Pollett J.B. Sun B. Urish K.L. Gharaibeh B.M. Cao B. et al.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), suggesting that estrogen signaling is not the sole contributor to differences in stem cell regulation between the sexes. Other studies have shown that females also exhibit increased capacity for rapid wound healing and liver regeneration, processes that are likely dependent on resident stem cell populations (Deasy et al., 2007Deasy B.M. Lu A. Tebbets J.C. Feduska J.M. Schugar R.C. Pollett J.B. Sun B. Urish K.L. Gharaibeh B.M. Cao B. et al.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 177: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, females tend to exhibit increased stem cell self-renewal, regeneration potential, and in some cases, proliferation. However, the question remains: does this tendency toward increased self-renewal in females alter the capacity of stem cells to regenerate tissues throughout aging, and does it influence longevity (Figure 1)? Many stem cell niches experience a decline in self-renewal potential with age (Signer and Morrison, 2013Signer R.A.J. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 152-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether age-associated changes in stem cells differ between the sexes. Interestingly, many canonical aging pathways have been shown to have a sex-specific effect on lifespan. For example, heterozygous knockout of insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (Igfr1) increases the lifespan of female mice only (Fontana and Partridge, 2015Fontana L. Partridge L. Cell. 2015; 161: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic overexpression of Sirt6 increases the lifespan of male mice only (Fontana and Partridge, 2015Fontana L. Partridge L. Cell. 2015; 161: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). What are the effects of sexual differences in aging pathways on stem cells? At this point few studies have addressed this question. However, the limited work in this field does point to potentially fascinating differences between the aging of male and female stem cells. With regards to HSCs, a study of a pair of dizygotic twins—a male and female—with hematopoietic chimerism demonstrated that in the male environment, both genotypically male and female HSCs had shorter telomeres as compared to the same cells in the female (Brüderlein et al., 2008Brüderlein S. Müller K. Melzner J. Högel J. Wiegand P. Möller P. Aging Cell. 2008; 7: 663-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This finding is consistent with the idea that a female organism provides an environment that is more conducive to sustained self-renewal. This study also suggests an intriguing non-cell-autonomous mechanism of differential aging patterns in male and female stem cells, mediated by the environment of the stem cells. There is undoubtedly a dearth of data addressing the differences in the aging of male and female stem cells, and this will likely be an active area for future investigation. Though the sexual dimorphism of aging stem cells has been largely uncharacterized, there are strong links between sexually dimorphic characteristics—most notably the sex steroid hormones—and classical aging pathways known to be important for stem cell maintenance. These links suggest potential mechanisms that may be involved in generating sex-dependent aging phenotypes in stem cells (Figure 1). One such mechanism is the sex-specific regulation of DNA damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several recent studies have explored the role of DNA damage and ROS accumulation in stem cell aging, processes which evidence suggests may be modulated by sex. One such study demonstrated that, in muscle, quiescent SCs accumulate DNA damage with age (Sousa-Victor et al., 2014Sousa-Victor P. Gutarra S. García-Prat L. Rodriguez-Ubreva J. Ortet L. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Jardí M. Ballestar E. González S. Serrano A.L. et al.Nature. 2014; 506: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). The accumulation of DNA damage over time in this stem cell population is associated with irreversible senescence (Sousa-Victor et al., 2014Sousa-Victor P. Gutarra S. García-Prat L. Rodriguez-Ubreva J. Ortet L. Ruiz-Bonilla V. Jardí M. Ballestar E. González S. Serrano A.L. et al.Nature. 2014; 506: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar), suggesting that DNA damage accumulation can lead to loss of regenerative potential. While the influence of sex cannot be determined in this particular case because the aforementioned study used only males, there is good reason to believe that sex may play a role. Estrogen is known to induce the expression of anti-oxidant genes and reduce ROS, while in contrast testosterone increases oxidative stress. Thus, DNA damage may be bidirectionally regulated by estrogen and testosterone in an oxidative tug-of-war, which may bear consequences for the health and regenerative potential of stem cells throughout the aging process. Another potential mechanism involves the conserved “pro-longevity” transcription factor FOXO3. FOXO3 is inhibited by insulin signaling and is necessary for increased longevity in insulin signaling mutants (Signer and Morrison, 2013Signer R.A.J. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 152-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), a pathway that has a greater impact on female than male lifespan (Fontana and Partridge, 2015Fontana L. Partridge L. Cell. 2015; 161: 106-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar). Moreover, FOXO3 has been shown to be vitally important for stem cell maintenance in both HSCs and NSCs by preventing premature stem cell exhaustion (Signer and Morrison, 2013Signer R.A.J. Morrison S.J. Cell Stem Cell. 2013; 12: 152-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Interestingly, FOXO3 can interact with estrogen receptor (ER-α) (Sisci et al., 2013Sisci D. Maris P. Cesario M.G. Anselmo W. Coroniti R. Trombino G.E. Romeo F. Ferraro A. Lanzino M. Aquila S. et al.Cell Cycle. 2013; 12: 3405-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This interaction is dependent on estrogen and profoundly alters the cellular effects of FOXO3 (Sisci et al., 2013Sisci D. Maris P. Cesario M.G. Anselmo W. Coroniti R. Trombino G.E. Romeo F. Ferraro A. Lanzino M. Aquila S. et al.Cell Cycle. 2013; 12: 3405-3420Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These data suggest a fascinating link between a known determinant of stem cell maintenance during aging and sex. A final prospective mechanism involves telomerase, which is expressed by many stem cell populations and is important for their regenerative potential. Intriguingly, estrogen itself is capable of activating telomerase directly through ER-mediated transcription of TERT, the protein component of the telomerase complex (Kyo et al., 1999Kyo S. Takakura M. Kanaya T. Zhuo W. Fujimoto K. Nishio Y. Orimo A. Inoue M. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5917-5921PubMed Google Scholar). This hints at an intriguing mechanism by which cells in a female environment could delay the aging process through the maintenance of telomeres. While there are several tantalizing links between known mediators of aging stem cells and sexual dimorphism, their relationships need to be further explored. This investigation may lead to new insights about the aging of stem cell populations and the sexual dimorphism of lifespan. Emerging evidence indicates that adult stem cells in non-sexual tissues are regulated in a sexually dimorphic manner and are responsive to sex hormones. Because stem cell maintenance is important for tissue regeneration throughout life, sex-associated differences in stem cell aging may be associated with sexual dimorphism in lifespan. At this point, however, very limited work has been done to directly address this question."
https://openalex.org/W626923965,"Anthropogenic disturbances often change ecological communities and provide opportunities for non-native species invasion. Understanding the impacts of disturbances on species invasion is therefore crucial for invasive species management. We used generalized linear mixed effects models to explore the influence of land-use history and distance to roads on the occurrence and abundance of two invasive plant species (Rosa multiflora and Berberis thunbergii) in a 900-ha deciduous forest in the eastern U.S.A., the Powdermill Nature Reserve. Although much of the reserve has been continuously forested since at least 1939, aerial photos revealed a variety of land-uses since then including agriculture, mining, logging, and development. By 2008, both R. multiflora and B. thunbergii were widespread throughout the reserve (occurring in 24% and 13% of 4417 10-m diameter regularly-placed vegetation plots, respectively) with occurrence and abundance of each varying significantly with land-use history. Rosa multiflora was more likely to occur in historically farmed, mined, logged or developed plots than in plots that remained forested, (log odds of 1.8 to 3.0); Berberis thunbergii was more likely to occur in plots with agricultural, mining, or logging history than in plots without disturbance (log odds of 1.4 to 2.1). Mining, logging, and agriculture increased the probability that R. multiflora had >10% cover while only past agriculture was related to cover of B. thunbergii. Proximity to roads was positively correlated with the occurrence of R. multiflora (a 0.26 increase in the log odds for every 1-m closer) but not B. thunbergii, and roads had no impact on the abundance of either species. Our results indicated that a wide variety of disturbances may aid the introduction of invasive species into new habitats, while high-impact disturbances such as agriculture and mining increase the likelihood of high abundance post-introduction."

Despite advances in treatment options including minimally invasive surgery, CT-guided radiation, novel chemotherapeutic regimens, and targeted therapeutics, prognosis remains dismal. Therefore, further molecular analysis of NSCLC is necessary to identify novel molecular targets that impact prognosis and the design of new-targeted therapies. In recent years, tumor ""activated/reprogrammed"" stromal cells that promote carcinogenesis have emerged as potential therapeutic targets. However, the contribution of stromal cells to NSCLC is poorly understood. Here, we show increased numbers of bone marrow (BM)-derived hematopoietic cells in the tumor parenchyma of NSCLC patients compared with matched adjacent non-neoplastic lung tissue. By sorting specific cellular fractions from lung cancer patients, we compared the transcriptomes of intratumoral myeloid compartments within the tumor bed with their counterparts within adjacent non-neoplastic tissue from NSCLC patients. The RNA sequencing of specific myeloid compartments (immature monocytic myeloid cells and polymorphonuclear neutrophils) identified differentially regulated genes and mRNA isoforms, which were inconspicuous in whole tumor analysis. Genes encoding secreted factors, including osteopontin (OPN), chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 (CCL7) and thrombospondin 1 (TSP1) were identified, which enhanced tumorigenic properties of lung cancer cells indicative of their potential as targets for therapy. This study demonstrates that analysis of homogeneous stromal populations isolated directly from fresh clinical specimens can detect important stromal genes of therapeutic value."
https://openalex.org/W614418182,"Background The involuntary admission regulated under the Mental Health Act has become an increasingly important issue in the developed countries in recent years. Most studies about the distribution and associated factors of involuntary admission were carried out in the western countries; however, the results may vary in different areas with different legal and socio-cultural backgrounds. Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion and associated factors of involuntary admission in a psychiatric emergency service in Taiwan. Methods The study cohort included patients admitted from a psychiatric emergency service over a two-year period. Demographic, psychiatric emergency service utilization, and clinical variables were compared between those who were voluntarily and involuntarily admitted to explore the associated factors of involuntary admission. Results Among 2,777 admitted patients, 110 (4.0%) were involuntarily admitted. Police referrals and presenting problems as violence assessed by psychiatric nurses were found to be associated with involuntary admission. These patients were more likely to be involuntarily admitted during the night shift and stayed longer in the psychiatric emergency service. Conclusions The proportion of involuntary admissions in Taiwan was in the lower range when compared to Western countries. Dangerous conditions evaluated by the psychiatric nurses and police rather than diagnosis made by the psychiatrists were related factors of involuntary admission. As it spent more time to admit involuntary patients, it was suggested that multidisciplinary professionals should be included in and educated for during the process of involuntary admission."
https://openalex.org/W608461471,"An important component of plant evolution is the plethora of pathways producing more than 200,000 biochemically diverse specialized metabolites with pharmacological, nutritional and ecological significance. To unravel dynamics underlying metabolic diversification, it is critical to determine lineage-specific gene family expansion in a phylogenomics framework. However, robust functional annotation is often only available for core enzymes catalyzing committed reaction steps within few model systems. In a genome informatics approach, we extracted information from early-draft gene-space assemblies and non-redundant transcriptomes to identify protein families involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis. Isoprenoids comprise terpenoids with various roles in plant-environment interaction, such as pollinator attraction or pathogen defense. Combining lines of evidence provided by synteny, sequence homology and Hidden-Markov-Modelling, we screened 17 genomes including 12 major crops and found evidence for 1,904 proteins associated with terpenoid biosynthesis. Our terpenoid genes set contains evidence for 840 core terpene-synthases and 338 triterpene-specific synthases. We further identified 190 prenyltransferases, 39 isopentenyl-diphosphate isomerases as well as 278 and 219 proteins involved in mevalonate and methylerithrol pathways, respectively. Assessing the impact of gene and genome duplication to lineage-specific terpenoid pathway expansion, we illustrated key events underlying terpenoid metabolic diversification within 250 million years of flowering plant radiation. By quantifying Angiosperm-wide versatility and phylogenetic relationships of pleiotropic gene families in terpenoid modular pathways, our analysis offers significant insight into evolutionary dynamics underlying diversification of plant secondary metabolism.

The water of these industrial processes contains natural phenolic extractives, aside from small amounts of admixtures (e.g., binders and paraffin). The suitability of two fungal laccases and one bacterial laccase was determined by biochemical characterization considering stability and substrate spectra. In a series of laboratory scale experiments, the selected commercial laccase from Myceliophtora thermophila was used to catalyze the surface modification of thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) using process water. The laccase catalyzed the covalent binding of the phenolic compounds of the process water onto the wood fiber surface and led to change of the surface chemistry directly via crosslinking of lignin moieties. Although a complete substitution of the binder was not accomplished by laccase, the combined use of laccase and latex significantly improved the mechanical strength properties of wood fiber boards. The enzymatically-treated TMP showed better interactions with the synthetic binder, as shown by FTIR-analysis. Moreover, the enzyme is extensively stable in the process water and the approach requires no fresh water as well as no cost-intensive mediator. By applying a second-order polynomial model in combination with the genetic algorithm (GA), the required amount of laccase and synthetic latex could be optimized enabling the reduction of the binder by 40%."
https://openalex.org/W1513288126,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of choline supplementation on intramuscular fat (IMF) and lipid oxidation in IUGR pigs. Twelve normal body weight (NBW) and twelve intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) newborn piglets were collected and distributed into 4 treatments (Normal: N, Normal+Choline: N+C, IUGR: I, and IUGR+Choline: I+C) with 6 piglets in each treatment. At 23 d of age, NBW and IUGR pigs were fed basal or choline supplemented diets. The results showed that the IUGR pigs had significantly lower (P<0.05) BW as compared with the NBW pigs at 23 d, 73 d, and 120 d of age, however, there was a slight decreased (P>0.05) in BW of IUGR pigs than the NBW pigs at 200 d. Compared with the NBW pigs, pH of meat longissimus dorsi muscle was significantly lower (P<0.05), and the meat color was improved in IUGR pigs. The malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were significantly decreased (P<0.05), while triglyceride (TG) and IMF contents were significantly higher (P<0.05) in the IUGR pigs than the NBW pigs. IUGR up-regulated the mRNA gene expression of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Dietary choline significantly increased (P<0.05) the BW at 120d of age, however, significantly decreased (P<0.05) the TG and IMF contents in both IUGR and NBW pigs. FAS and sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1 (SREBP1) mRNA gene expressions were increased (P<0.05) while the muscle-carnitine palmityl transferase (M-CPT) and peroxisome proliferators-activated receptorγ (PPARγ) mRNA (P<0.05) gene expressions were decreased in the muscles of the IUGR pigs by choline supplementation. Furthermore, choline supplementation significantly increased (P<0.05) the MDA content as well as the O2•¯ scavenging activity in meat of IUGR pigs. The results suggested that IUGR pigs showed a permanent stunting effect on the growth performance, increased fat deposition and oxidative stress in muscles. However, dietary supplementation of choline improved the fat deposition via enhancing the lipogenesis and reducing the lipolysis."
https://openalex.org/W569686684,"Spliceosomal introns are key components of the eukaryotic gene structure. Although they contributed to the emergence of eukaryotes, their origin remains elusive. In fungi, they might originate from the multiplication of invasive introns named Introner-Like Elements (ILEs). However, so far ILEs have been observed in six fungal species only, including Fulvia fulva and Dothistroma septosporum (Dothideomycetes), arguing against ILE insertion as a general mechanism for intron gain. Here, we identified novel ILEs in eight additional fungal species that are phylogenetically related to F. fulva and D. septosporum using PCR amplification with primers derived from previously identified ILEs. The ILE content appeared unique to each species, suggesting independent multiplication events. Interestingly, we identified four genes each containing two gained ILEs. By analysing intron positions in orthologues of these four genes in Ascomycota, we found that three ILEs had inserted within a 15 bp window that contains regular spliceosomal introns in other fungal species. These three positions are not the result of intron sliding because ILEs are newly gained introns. Furthermore, the alternative hypothesis of an inferred ancestral gain followed by independent losses contradicts the observed degeneration of ILEs. These observations clearly indicate three parallel intron gains in four genes that were randomly identified. Our findings suggest that parallel intron gain is a phenomenon that has been highly underestimated in ILE-containing fungi, and likely in the whole fungal kingdom."
https://openalex.org/W611638444,"Background Adequate patient knowledge about medications is essential for appropriate drug taking behavior and patient adherence. This study aims to assess and quantify the level of knowledge and adherence to medications among Palestinian geriatrics living with chronic diseases and to investigate possible associated socio-demographic characteristics. Methods and Findings We conducted a cross-sectional study during June 2013 and January 2014 among Palestinian geriatrics ≥60 years old living with chronic disease in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. A stratified random sample was selected and a questionnaire-assisted interview was applied for data collection. T-test was applied for bivariate analyzing and one-way ANOVA test was applied for multivariate analyses. Results A total of 1192 Palestinian geriatrics were studied. The average age was 70.3 (SD=8.58) years and ranged from 60-110 years. The sample comprised 659 (55.3%) females and 533 (44.7%) males. The global knowledge and global adherence scores were (67.57%) and (89.29%), respectively. Adequate levels of knowledge were 71.4%, and of adherence 75%, which were recorded for 705 (59.1%) and 1088 (91.3%) participants, respectively. Significant higher levels of global knowledge and global adherence were recorded for males, and for participants who hold a Bachelor’s degree, those who live on their own, and did physical activity for more than 40 hours/week (p-value <0.05). Furthermore, workers, participants with a higher monthly income, and non-smokers have a higher knowledge level with (p-value <0.05). We found positive correlation between participants’ global adherence and global knowledge (r=0.487 and p-value <0.001). Negative correlation was found between participants’ global knowledge and adherence with age (r= -0.236, p-value <0.001 and r= -0.211 and p-value <0.001, respectively. Negative correlation between global knowledge and the number of drugs taken (r= -0.130, p-value <0.001) was predicted. Conclusion We concluded that patients with a higher level of knowledge are more adherent to their medications and that better understanding of socio-demographic factors has a clear influence on the level of knowledge and adherence to medications and thus contributes to the development of guidelines for treatment and may consequently lead to favourable clinical outcomes and savings of health care costs."
https://openalex.org/W613134563,"Calponins form an evolutionary highly conserved family of actin filament-associated proteins expressed in both smooth muscle and non-muscle cells. Whereas calponin-1 and calponin-2 have already been studied to some extent, little is known about the role of calponin-3 under physiological conditions due to the lack of an appropriate animal model. Here, we have used an unbiased screen to identify novel proteins implicated in signal transduction downstream of the precursor B cell receptor (pre-BCR) in B cells. We find that calponin-3 is expressed throughout early B cell development, localizes to the plasma membrane and is phosphorylated in a Syk-dependent manner, suggesting a putative role in pre-BCR signaling. To investigate this in vivo, we generated a floxed calponin-3-GFP knock-in mouse model that enables tracking of cells expressing calponin-3 from its endogenous promoter and allows its tissue-specific deletion. Using the knock-in allele as a reporter, we show that calponin-3 expression is initiated in early B cells and increases with their maturation, peaking in the periphery. Surprisingly, conditional deletion of the Cnn3 revealed no gross defects in B cell development despite this regulated expression pattern and the in vitro evidence, raising the question whether other components may compensate for its loss in lymphocytes. Together, our work identifies calponin-3 as a putative novel mediator downstream of the pre-BCR. Beyond B cells, the mouse model we generated will help to increase our understanding of calponin-3 in muscle and non-muscle cells under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W651891244,"The signal peptide peptidases (SPPs) are biomedically important proteases implicated as therapeutic targets for hepatitis C (human SPP, (hSPP)), plasmodium (Plasmodium SPP (pSPP)), and B-cell immunomodulation and neoplasia (signal peptide peptidase like 2a, (SPPL2a)). To date, no drug-like, selective inhibitors have been reported. We use a recombinant substrate based on the amino-terminus of BRI2 fused to amyloid β 1-25 (Aβ1-25) (FBA) to develop facile, cost-effective SPP/SPPL protease assays. Co-transfection of expression plasmids expressing the FBA substrate with SPP/SPPLs were conducted to evaluate cleavage, which was monitored by ELISA, Western Blot and immunoprecipitation/MALDI-TOF Mass spectrometry (IP/MS). No cleavage is detected in the absence of SPP/SPPL overexpression. Multiple γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) and (Z-LL)2 ketone differentially inhibited SPP/SPPL activity; for example, IC50 of LY-411,575 varied from 51±79 nM (on SPPL2a) to 5499±122 nM (on SPPL2b), while Compound E showed inhibition only on hSPP with IC50 of 1465±93 nM. Data generated were predictive of effects observed for endogenous SPPL2a cleavage of CD74 in a murine B-Cell line. Thus, it is possible to differentially inhibit SPP family members. These SPP/SPPL cleavage assays will expedite the search for selective inhibitors. The data also reinforce similarities between SPP family member cleavage and cleavage catalyzed by γ-secretase."
https://openalex.org/W1591131124,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a clonal malignancy of mature B cells that displays a great clinical heterogeneity, with many patients having an indolent disease that will not require intervention for many years, while others present an aggressive and symptomatic leukemia requiring immediate treatment. Although there is no cure for CLL, the disease is treatable and current standard chemotherapy regimens have been shown to prolong survival. Recent advances in our understanding of the biology of CLL have led to the identification of numerous cellular and molecular markers with potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic significance. We have used the recently developed digital multiplexed gene-expression technique (DMGE) to analyze a cohort of 30 CLL patients for the presence of specific genes with known diagnostic and prognostic potential. Starting from a set of 290 genes we were able to develop a molecular signature, based on the analysis of 13 genes, which allows distinguishing CLL from normal peripheral blood and from normal B cells, and a second signature based on 24 genes, which distinguishes mutated from unmutated cases (LymphCLL Mut). A third classifier (LymphCLL Diag), based on a 44-gene signature, distinguished CLL cases from a series of other B-cell chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (n = 51). While the methodology presented here has the potential to provide a ""ready to use"" classification tool in routine diagnostics and clinical trials, application to larger sample numbers are still needed and should provide further insights about its robustness and utility in clinical practice."
https://openalex.org/W2197164131,"Background It is not known whether parasympathetic outflow simultaneously acts on bronchial tone and cardiovascular system waxing and waning both systems in parallel, or, alternatively, whether the regulation is more dependent on local factors and therefore independent on each system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the simultaneous effect of different kinds of stimulations, all associated with parasympathetic activation, on bronchomotor tone and cardiovascular autonomic regulation. Methods Respiratory system resistance (Rrs, forced oscillation technique) and cardio-vascular activity (heart rate, oxygen saturation, tissue oxygenation index, blood pressure) were assessed in 13 volunteers at baseline and during a series of parasympathetic stimuli: O2 inhalation, stimulation of the carotid sinus baroreceptors by neck suction, slow breathing, and inhalation of methacholine. Results Pure cholinergic stimuli, like O2 inhalation and baroreceptors stimulation, caused an increase in Rrs and a reduction in heart rate and blood pressure. Slow breathing led to bradycardia and hypotension, without significant changes in Rrs. However slow breathing was associated with deep inhalations, and Rrs evaluated at the baseline lung volumes was significantly increased, suggesting that the large tidal volumes reversed the airways narrowing effect of parasympathetic activation. Finally inhaled methacholine caused marked airway narrowing, while the cardiovascular variables were unaffected, presumably because of the sympathetic activity triggered in response to hypoxemia. Conclusions All parasympathetic stimuli affected bronchial tone and moderately affected also the cardiovascular system. However the response differed depending on the nature of the stimulus. Slow breathing was associated with large tidal volumes that reversed the airways narrowing effect of parasympathetic activation."
https://openalex.org/W1925834768,"Amnesia is usually described as an impairment of a long-term memory (LTM) despite an intact short-term memory (STM). The intact recency effect in amnesia had supported this view. Although dual-store models of memory have been challenged by single-store models based on interference theory, this had relatively little influence on our understanding and treatment of amnesia, perhaps because the debate has centred on experiments in the neurologically intact population. Here we tested a key prediction of single-store models for free recall in amnesia: that people with amnesia will exhibit a memory advantage for the most recent items even when all items are stored in and retrieved from LTM, an effect called long-term recency. People with amnesia and matched controls studied, and then free-recalled, word lists with a distractor task following each word, including the last (continual distractor task, CDFR). This condition was compared to an Immediate Free Recall (IFR, no distractors) and a Delayed Free Recall (DFR, end-of-list distractor only) condition. People with amnesia demonstrated the full long-term recency pattern: the recency effect was attenuated in DFR and returned in CDFR. The advantage of recency over midlist items in CDFR was comparable to that of controls, confirming a key prediction of single-store models. Memory deficits appeared only after the first word recalled in each list, suggesting the impairment in amnesia may emerge only as the participant's recall sequence develops, perhaps due to increased susceptibility to output interference. Our findings suggest that interference mechanisms are preserved in amnesia despite the overall impairment to LTM, and challenge strict dual-store models of memory and their dominance in explaining amnesia. We discuss the implication of our findings for rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W609650002,"Background The use of liquid medium (MGIT960) for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis was recommended by WHO in 2007. However, there has been no evaluation of its effectiveness on clinically important outcomes. Methods and Findings A pragmatic trial was carried out in a tertiary hospital and a secondary health care unit in Rio de Janeiro City, Brazil. Participants were 16 years or older, suspected of having TB. They were excluded if only cerebral spinal fluid or blood specimens were available for analysis. MGIT960 technique was compared with the Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) method for laboratory diagnosis of active TB. Primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had their initial medical management changed within 2 months after randomisation. Secondary outcomes were: mean time for changing the procedure, patient satisfaction with the overall treatment and adverse events. Data were analysed by intention-to-treat. Between April 2008 and September 2011, 693 patients were enrolled (348 to MGIT, 345 to LJ). Smear and culture results were positive for 10% and 15.7% of participants, respectively. Patients in the MGIT arm had their initial medical management changed more frequently than those in the LJ group (10.1% MGIT vs 3.8% LJ, RR 2.67 95% CI 1.44–.96, p = 0.002, NNT 16, 95% CI 10–39). Mean time for changing the initial procedure was greater in LJ group at both sites: 20.0 and 29.6 days in MGIT group and 52.2 and 64.3 in LJ group (MD 33.5, 95% CI 30.6–36.4, p = 0.0001). No other important differences were observed. Conclusions This study suggests that opting for the MGIT960 system for TB diagnosis provides a promising case management model for improving the quality of care and control of TB.

https://openalex.org/W1162621065,"Ectopically expressed Cre recombinase in extrapancreatic tissues in RIP-Cre mice has been well documented. The objective of this study was to find a simple solution that allows for improved beta-cell specific targeting. To this end, the RIP-Cre and reporter CMV-loxP-DsRed-loxP-EGFP expression cassettes were configurated into a one-plasmid and two-plasmid systems, which labeled approximately 80% insulin-positive INS-1 cells after 48 h transfection. However, off-target labeling was robustly found in more than 15% insulin-negative Ad293 cells. When an IRES element was inserted in front of Cre to reduce the translation efficiency, the ratio of recombination between INS-1 and Ad293 cells increased 3-4-fold. Further, a series of Cre mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. When one of the mutants, Cre(H289P) in both configurations, was used in the experiment, the percentage of recombination dropped to background levels in a number of insulin-negative cell lines, but decreased only slightly in INS-1 cells. Consistently, DNA substrate digestion assay showed that the enzymatic activity of Cre(H289P) was reduced by 30-fold as compared to that of wild-type. In this study, we reported the generation of constructs containing RIP and Cre mutants, which enabled enhanced beta-cell specific labeling in vitro. These tools could be invaluable for beta-cell targeting and to the study of islet development."
https://openalex.org/W592148633,"Indicators are used to quantify the pressure of pesticides on the environment. Pesticide risk indicators typically require weighting environmental exposure by a no effect concentration. An indicator based on spread equivalents (ΣSeq) is used in environmental policy in Flanders (Belgium). The pesticide risk for aquatic life is estimated by weighting active ingredient usage by the ratio of their maximum allowable concentration and their soil halflife. Accurate estimates of total pesticide usage in the region are essential in such calculations. Up to 2012, the environmental impact of pesticides was estimated on sales figures provided by the Federal Government. Since 2013, pesticide use is calculated based on results from the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN). The estimation of pesticide use was supplemented with data for non-agricultural use based on sales figures of amateur use provided by industry and data obtained from public services. The Seq-indicator was modified to better reflect reality. This method was applied for the period 2009-2012 and showed differences between estimated use and sales figures of pesticides. The estimated use of pesticides based on accountancy data is more accurate compared to sales figures. This approach resulted in a better view on pesticide use and its respective environmental impact in Flanders."
https://openalex.org/W1529449999,"Preclinical in vivo CT is commonly used to visualise vessels at a macroscopic scale. However, it is prone to many artefacts which can degrade the quality of CT images significantly. Although some artefacts can be partially corrected for during image processing, they are best avoided during acquisition. Here, a novel imaging cradle and tumour holder was designed to maximise CT resolution. This approach was used to improve preclinical in vivo imaging of the tumour vasculature.A custom built cradle containing a tumour holder was developed and fix-mounted to the CT system gantry to avoid artefacts arising from scanner vibrations and out-of-field sample positioning. The tumour holder separated the tumour from bones along the axis of rotation of the CT scanner to avoid bone-streaking. It also kept the tumour stationary and insensitive to respiratory motion. System performance was evaluated in terms of tumour immobilisation and reduction of motion and bone artefacts. Pre- and post-contrast CT followed by sequential DCE-MRI of the tumour vasculature in xenograft transplanted mice was performed to confirm vessel patency and demonstrate the multimodal capacity of the new cradle. Vessel characteristics such as diameter, and branching were quantified.Image artefacts originating from bones and out-of-field sample positioning were avoided whilst those resulting from motions were reduced significantly, thereby maximising the resolution that can be achieved with CT imaging in vivo. Tumour vessels ≥ 77 μm could be resolved and blood flow to the tumour remained functional. The diameter of each tumour vessel was determined and plotted as histograms and vessel branching maps were created. Multimodal imaging using this cradle assembly was preserved and demonstrated.The presented imaging workflow minimised image artefacts arising from scanner induced vibrations, respiratory motion and radiopaque structures and enabled in vivo CT imaging and quantitative analysis of the tumour vasculature at higher resolution than was possible before. Moreover, it can be applied in a multimodal setting, therefore combining anatomical and dynamic information."
https://openalex.org/W1900176936,"Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd), a chytrid fungus, has increasingly been implicated as a major factor in the worldwide decline of amphibian populations. The fungus causes chytridiomycosis in susceptible species leading to massive die-offs of adult amphibians. Although Bd infects the keratinized mouthparts of tadpoles and negatively affects foraging behavior, these infections are non-lethal. An important morphogen controlling amphibian metamorphosis is thyroid hormone (T3). Tadpoles may be infected with Bd and the fungus may be exposed to T3 during metamorphosis. We hypothesize that exposure of Bd to T3 may induce the expression of factors associated with host colonization and pathogenicity. We utilized a proteomics approach to better understand the dynamics of the Bd-T3 interaction. Using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we generated a data set of a large number of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins following exposure of Bd to T3. From these data, we identified a total of 263 proteins whose expression was significantly changed following T3 exposure. We provide evidence for expression of an array of proteins that may play key roles in both genomic and non-genomic actions of T3 in Bd. Additionally, our proteomics study shows an increase in several proteins including proteases and a class of uncommon crinkler and crinkler-like effector proteins suggesting their importance in Bd pathogenicity as well as those involved in metabolism and energy transfer, protein fate, transport and stress responses. This approach provides insights into the mechanistic basis of the Bd-amphibian interaction following T3 exposure."
https://openalex.org/W598693763,"Erythropoietin, Epo, is a 30.4 kDa glycoprotein hormone produced primarily by the fetal liver and the adult kidney. Epo exerts its haematopoietic effects by stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of erythrocytes with subsequent improved tissue oxygenation. Epo receptors are furthermore expressed in non-haematopoietic tissue and today, Epo is recognised as a cytokine with many pleiotropic effects. We hypothesize that hydrodynamic gene therapy with Epo can restore haemoglobin levels in anaemic transgenic mice and that this will attenuate the extracellular matrix accumulation in the kidneys. The experiment is conducted by hydrodynamic gene transfer of a plasmid encoding murine Epo in a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses TGF-β1 locally in the kidneys. This model develops anaemia due to chronic kidney disease characterised by thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, deposition of mesangial matrix and mild interstitial fibrosis. A group of age matched wildtype littermates are treated accordingly. After a single hydrodynamic administration of plasmid DNA containing murine EPO gene, sustained high haemoglobin levels are observed in both transgenic and wildtype mice from 7.5 ± 0.6 mmol/L to 9.4 ± 1.2 mmol/L and 10.7 ± 0.3 mmol/L to 15.5 ± 0.5 mmol/L, respectively. We did not observe any effects in the thickness of glomerular or tubular basement membrane, on the expression of different collagen types in the kidneys or in kidney function after prolonged treatment with Epo. Thus, Epo treatment in this model of chronic kidney disease normalises haemoglobin levels but has no effect on kidney fibrosis or function."
