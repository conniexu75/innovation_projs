https://openalex.org/W2028950045,"IN a previous communication1 it was shown that strong static magnetic fields retard, the growth of young mice. The maximum weight difference, relative to identically housed controls, is reached after 10–12 days of residence in a homogeneous field of 4,200 œ strength. In the first such experiments, conducted in 1948 in the Institute for Experimental Physics of the University of Budapest, as well as in the twelve subsequent experiments conducted on several hundred mice in the laboratory of the Biomagnetic Research Foundation in Evanston, Illinois, a sharp drop in the weight of the mice was observed on the second day of residence in the field, followed by a steep increase up to the base line."

https://openalex.org/W159834219,"IT has been found that male skin grafts are rejected by female mice in the C57BL strain1. On the other hand, it has been well ascertained that an introduction of the histocompatibility antigens into inbred mice can elicit humoral antibodies to cause hæmagglutination of the donor red cells. This communication shows that the sera of female mice sensitized with male tissues can agglutinate specifically blood cells of intact male mice. DD strain mice were used for experiments. The female animals were subjected to the following treatment: A subcutaneous injection of 0.2 ml. testis-Freund's adjuvant emulsion per week for 4–6 weeks. Each of the injections contained 15–33 per cent testis homogenate. One to two weeks after the last injection the antisera were collected from the sensitized female mice, and kept at −20° C until the use for the present hæmagglutination test."

https://openalex.org/W2090139350,"Sowden and Pirie1 analysed the barium and strontium content of different parts of the eye and confirmed earlier work showing that cattle choroid contained large amounts of barium. These authors did not, however, separate the tapetal fibres from the pigmented choroid and determine whether barium was also present in the tapetum. Weitzel et al.2 have shown that zinc is an integral part of the tapetum of carnivores, and although the structure of the tapetum of the cow is quite different from that in carnivores we thought it would be interesting to determine whether there was any particular concentration of barium in the tapetum of the cow. This is a specialized part of the central choroid lying immediately under the retina and made up of fine parallel fibres which act as a diffraction grating and reflect light3. It is backed by pigmented choroidal tissue."

https://openalex.org/W2080844612,"IN a series of experiments, Harlow1 and other investigators have studied learning-sets in a number of species. Their evidence demonstrates that the ability to form learning sets is related both to the phylogenetic ‘level’ of a species and to the individual animal's ontogenetic development. When trying to establish learning sets in such an animal as the rat, the difficulty has been that the learning of individual problems has taken so long that it was not possible to present sufficient problems to examine this phenomenon of learning to learn."

https://openalex.org/W2068616871,"IF a coloured stimulus, a white stimulus, and relative absence of stimulus are repeatedly presented in that order for 0.017, 0.10 and 0.083 sec respectively, there are values of stimuli brightness at which only the complement of the coloured stimulus is perceived. This effect, first reported by Bidwell in 18971, has facilitated investigations of after-images; the decision as to which of two complementary colours is seen is more accurately made than are decisions as to the colour, intensity, or duration of afterimages. The study of induced negative after-images is of interest, as these phenomena depend on the relation between excitatory and inhibitory retinal reaction and may be used in physiological and pharmacological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2071993520,"IT is well-known that certain strains of Escherichia coli (particularly 086:B7) are antigenically related to human red cell group A and group B substances. There have been differences in the results reported by different workers. Springer1,2 found only anti-B activity in the sera of rabbits injected with Escherichia coli 086:B7 which was phenolized and then vacuum-dried. Using both living and treated preparations, Gonano et al.3 showed both anti-A and anti-B activity, but in rather low titre, and their absorption studies gave rather disappointing results."
