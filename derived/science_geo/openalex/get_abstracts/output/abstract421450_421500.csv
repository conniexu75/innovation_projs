https://openalex.org/W1986364193,"At present, plant molecular systematics and DNA barcoding techniques rely heavily on the use of chloroplast gene sequences. Because of the relatively low evolutionary rates of chloroplast genes, there are very few choices suitable for molecular studies on angiosperms at low taxonomic levels, and for DNA barcoding of species.We scanned the entire chloroplast genomes of 12 genera to search for highly variable regions. The sequence data of 9 genera were from GenBank and 3 genera were of our own. We identified nearly 5% of the most variable loci from all variable loci in the chloroplast genomes of each genus, and then selected 23 loci that were present in at least three genera. The 23 loci included 4 coding regions, 2 introns, and 17 intergenic spacers. Of the 23 loci, the most variable (in order from highest variability to lowest) were intergenic regions ycf1-a, trnK, rpl32-trnL, and trnH-psbA, followed by trnS(UGA)-trnG(UCC), petA-psbJ, rps16-trnQ, ndhC-trnV, ycf1-b, ndhF, rpoB-trnC, psbE-petL, and rbcL-accD. Three loci, trnS(UGA)-trnG(UCC), trnT-psbD, and trnW-psaJ, showed very high nucleotide diversity per site (π values) across three genera. Other loci may have strong potential for resolving phylogenetic and species identification problems at the species level. The loci accD-psaI, rbcL-accD, rpl32-trnL, rps16-trnQ, and ycf1 are absent from some genera. To amplify and sequence the highly variable loci identified in this study, we designed primers from their conserved flanking regions. We tested the applicability of the primers to amplify target sequences in eight species representing basal angiosperms, monocots, eudicots, rosids, and asterids, and confirmed that the primers amplified the desired sequences of these species.Chloroplast genome sequences contain regions that are highly variable. Such regions are the first consideration when screening the suitable loci to resolve closely related species or genera in phylogenetic analyses, and for DNA barcoding."
https://openalex.org/W2064163649,"The cardiac Na(+) channel Na(V)1.5 current (I(Na)) is critical to cardiac excitability, and altered I(Na) gating has been implicated in genetic and acquired arrhythmias. Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is up-regulated in heart failure and has been shown to cause I(Na) gating changes that mimic those induced by a point mutation in humans that is associated with combined long QT and Brugada syndromes. We sought to identify the site(s) on Na(V)1.5 that mediate(s) the CaMKII-induced alterations in I(Na) gating. We analyzed both CaMKII binding and CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of the intracellularly accessible regions of Na(V)1.5 using a series of GST fusion constructs, immobilized peptide arrays, and soluble peptides. A stable interaction between δ(C)-CaMKII and the intracellular loop between domains 1 and 2 of Na(V)1.5 was observed. This region was also phosphorylated by δ(C)-CaMKII, specifically at the Ser-516 and Thr-594 sites. Wild-type (WT) and phosphomutant hNa(V)1.5 were co-expressed with GFP-δ(C)-CaMKII in HEK293 cells, and I(Na) was recorded. As observed in myocytes, CaMKII shifted WT I(Na) availability to a more negative membrane potential and enhanced accumulation of I(Na) into an intermediate inactivated state, but these effects were abolished by mutating either of these sites to non-phosphorylatable Ala residues. Mutation of these sites to phosphomimetic Glu residues negatively shifted I(Na) availability without the need for CaMKII. CaMKII-dependent phosphorylation of Na(V)1.5 at multiple sites (including Thr-594 and Ser-516) appears to be required to evoke loss-of-function changes in gating that could contribute to acquired Brugada syndrome-like effects in heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1979956597,"Ischemic heart disease is the major cause of death in Western countries. CTRP9 (C1q/TNF-related protein 9) is a fat-derived plasma protein that has salutary effects on glucose metabolism and vascular function. However, the functional role of CTRP9 in ischemic heart disease has not been clarified. Here, we examined the regulation of CTRP9 in response to acute cardiac injury and investigated whether CTRP9 modulates cardiac damage after ischemia and reperfusion. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury resulted in reduced plasma CTRP9 levels and increased plasma free fatty acid levels, which were accompanied by a decrease in CTRP9 expression and an increase in NADPH oxidase component expression in fat tissue. Treatment of cultured adipocytes with palmitic acid or hydrogen peroxide reduced CTRP9 expression. Systemic administration of CTRP9 to wild-type mice, before the induction of ischemia or at the time of reperfusion, led to a reduction in myocardial infarct size following ischemia-reperfusion. Administration of CTRP9 also attenuated myocyte apoptosis in ischemic heart, which was accompanied by increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Treatment of cardiac myocytes with CTRP9 protein reduced apoptosis in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation and stimulated AMPK phosphorylation. Blockade of AMPK activity reversed the suppressive actions of CTRP9 on cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Knockdown of adiponectin receptor 1 diminished CTRP9-induced increases in AMPK phosphorylation and survival of cardiac myocytes. Our data suggest that CTRP9 protects against acute cardiac injury following ischemia-reperfusion via an AMPK-dependent mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1975412690,"Background We evaluated the association of central versus overall adiposity on levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4) among euthyroid subjects taken from a cross-sectional, representative sample of the adult non-institutionalized U.S. population. Methods The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2007–2008 included 1,623 men and 1,491 women who were 20 years and older, with no history of thyroid or liver disease, kidney failure, diabetes, or thyroid function-altering prescription medication use (based on self-report), and having TSH, fT3, and fT4 levels between 0.5–4.49 mIU/L, 2.5–3.9 pg/mL, and 0.6–1.6 ng/dL, respectively. Associations between body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (measures of overall and central adiposity, respectively) and TSH, fT3, and fT4 levels were estimated using multivariable linear regression models stratified by sex and adjusted for age, race, smoking status, and alcohol intake. Results An increase in serum TSH levels was observed for every 1-quartile increase in BMI in euthyroid men (3.8% [95% CI 0.8%, 6.8%]) and euthyroid women (4.0% [95% CI 1.6%, 6.5%]). Similar, albeit slightly weaker, associations were observed with waist circumference. We also found increases in fT3 levels with every 1-quartile increase in BMI (1.0% in men and 1.3% in women) and waist circumference (1.2% in men and 1.2% in women). No associations were observed with fT4. Conclusions Our results provide support that BMI and waist circumference are positively associated with levels of serum TSH and f T3 but not fT4 among euthyroid adults. Longitudinal studies are needed to define the temporality of these associations and their potential health implications."
https://openalex.org/W1983514254,"Background The current spread of the gene encoding the metallo-ß-lactamase NDM-1 in Enterobacteriaceae is linked to a variety of surrounding genetic structures and plasmid scaffolds. Methodology The whole sequence of plasmid pGUE-NDM carrying the blaNDM-1 gene was determined by high-density pyrosequencing and a genomic comparative analysis with other blaNDM-1-negative IncFII was performed. Principal Findings Plasmid pGUE-NDM replicating in Escherichia coli confers resistance to many antibiotic molecules including β-lactams, aminoglycosides, trimethoprim, and sulfonamides. It is 87,022 bp in-size and carries the two β-lactamase genes blaNDM-1 and blaOXA-1, together with three aminoglycoside resistance genes aacA4, aadA2, and aacC2. Comparative analysis of the multidrug resistance locus contained a module encompassing the blaNDM-1 gene that is actually conserved among different structures identified in other enterobacterial isolates. This module was constituted by the blaNDM-1 gene, a fragment of insertion sequence ISAba125 and a bleomycin resistance encoding gene. Significance This is the first characterized blaNDM-1-carrying IncFII-type plasmid. Such association between the blaNDM-1 gene and an IncFII-type plasmid backbone is extremely worrisome considering that this plasmid type is known to spread efficiently, as examplified with the worldwide dissemination of blaCTX-M-15-borne IncFII plasmids."
https://openalex.org/W2070016881,"Diabetic conditions are associated with modified brain function, namely with cognitive deficits, through largely undetermined processes. More than understanding the underlying mechanism, it is important to devise novel strategies to alleviate diabetes-induced cognitive deficits. Caffeine (a mixed antagonist of adenosine A1 and A2A receptors) emerges as a promising candidate since caffeine consumption reduces the risk of diabetes and effectively prevents memory deficits caused by different noxious stimuli. Thus, we took advantage of a novel animal model of type 2 diabetes to investigate the behavioural, neurochemical and morphological modifications present in the hippocampus and tested if caffeine consumption might prevent these changes. We used a model closely mimicking the human type 2 diabetes condition, NONcNZO10/LtJ mice, which become diabetic at 7–11 months when kept under an 11% fat diet. Caffeine (1 g/l) was applied in the drinking water from 7 months onwards. Diabetic mice displayed a decreased spontaneous alternation in the Y-maze accompanied by a decreased density of nerve terminal markers (synaptophysin, SNAP25), mainly glutamatergic (vesicular glutamate transporters), and increased astrogliosis (GFAP immunoreactivity) compared to their wild type littermates kept under the same diet. Furthermore, diabetic mice displayed up-regulated A2A receptors and down-regulated A1 receptors in the hippocampus. Caffeine consumption restored memory performance and abrogated the diabetes-induced loss of nerve terminals and astrogliosis. These results provide the first evidence that type 2 diabetic mice display a loss of nerve terminal markers and astrogliosis, which is associated with memory impairment; furthermore, caffeine consumption prevents synaptic dysfunction and astrogliosis as well as memory impairment in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W1982938322,"Adhesion to host cells is an initial and important step in Acinetobacter baumannii pathogenesis. However, there is relatively little information on the mechanisms by which A. baumannii binds to and interacts with host cells. Adherence to extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin, affords pathogens with a mechanism to invade epithelial cells. Here, we found that A. baumannii adheres more avidly to immobilized fibronectin than to control protein. Free fibronectin used as a competitor resulted in dose-dependent decreased binding of A. baumannii to fibronectin. Three outer membrane preparations (OMPs) were identified as fibronectin binding proteins (FBPs): OMPA, TonB-dependent copper receptor, and 34 kDa OMP. Moreover, we demonstrated that fibronectin inhibition and neutralization by specific antibody prevented significantly the adhesion of A. baumannii to human lung epithelial cells (A549 cells). Similarly, A. baumannii OMPA neutralization by specific antibody decreased significantly the adhesion of A. baumannii to A549 cells. These data indicate that FBPs are key adhesins that mediate binding of A. baumannii to human lung epithelial cells through interaction with fibronectin on the surface of these host cells."
https://openalex.org/W2082634826,"Background The molecular mechanisms implicated in regionalized gene expression in the human epididymis have not yet been fully elucidated. Interestingly, more than 200 microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified in the human epididymis and could be involved in the regulation of mRNA stability and post-transcriptional expression in this organ. Methods Using a miRNA microarray approach, we investigated the correlation between miRNA signatures and gene expression profiles found in three distinct regions (caput, corpus and cauda) of human epididymides from 3 donors. In silico prediction of transcript miRNA targets was performed using TargetScan and Miranda software's. FHCE1 immortalized epididymal cell lines were cotransfected with mimic microRNAs and plasmid constructs containing the 3′UTR of predicted target genes downstream of the luciferase gene. Results We identified 35 miRNAs differentially expressed in the distinct segments of the epididymis (fold change ≥2, P-value≤0.01). Among these miRNAs, miR-890, miR-892a, miR-892b, miR-891a, miR-891b belonging to the same epididymis-enriched cluster located on the X chromosome, are significantly more expressed in the corpus and cauda regions than in the caput. Interestingly, a strong negative correlation (r = −0,89, P-value≤0.001) was found between the pattern of expression of miR-892b and its potential mRNA target Esrrg (Estrogen Related Receptor Gamma) and with miR-145 and Cldn10 mRNA (r = −0,92, P-value≤0.001). We confirmed that miR-145 and miR-892b inhibit the expression of the luciferase reporter via Cldn10 and Esrrg 3′ UTRs, respectively. Conclusion Our study shows that the expression of miRNAs is segmented along the human epididymis and correlates with the pattern of target gene expression in different regions. Therefore, epididymal miRNAs may be in control of the maintenance of gene expression profile in the epididymis, which dictates segment-specific secretion of proteins and establishes physiological compartments that directly or indirectly affect sperm maturation and fertility."
https://openalex.org/W2042961694,"Overcoming remyelination failure is a major goal of new therapies for demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis. LINGO-1, a key negative regulator of myelination, is a transmembrane signaling protein expressed in both neurons and oligodendrocytes. In neurons, LINGO-1 is an integral component of the Nogo receptor complex, which inhibits axonal growth via RhoA. Because the only ligand-binding subunit of this complex, the Nogo receptor, is absent in oligodendrocytes, the extracellular signals that inhibit myelination through a LINGO-1-mediated mechanism are unknown. Here we show that LINGO-1 inhibits oligodendrocyte terminal differentiation through intercellular interactions and is capable of a self-association in trans. Consistent with previous reports, overexpression of full-length LINGO-1 inhibited differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). Unexpectedly, treatment with a soluble recombinant LINGO-1 ectodomain also had an inhibitory effect on OPCs and decreased myelinated axonal segments in cocultures with neurons from dorsal root ganglia. We demonstrated LINGO-1-mediated inhibition of OPCs through intercellular signaling by using a surface-bound LINGO-1 construct expressed ectopically in astrocytes. Further investigation showed that the soluble LINGO-1 ectodomain can interact with itself in trans by binding to CHO cells expressing full-length LINGO-1. Finally, we observed that soluble LINGO-1 could activate RhoA in OPCs. We propose that LINGO-1 acts as both a ligand and a receptor and that the mechanism by which it negatively regulates OPC differentiation and myelination is mediated by a homophilic intercellular interaction. Disruption of this protein-protein interaction could lead to a decrease of LINGO-1 inhibition and an increase in myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1995683971,"We have previously shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) improved performance of a complex visual perceptual learning task (Clark et al. 2012). However, it is not known whether tDCS can enhance perceptual sensitivity independently of non-specific, arousal-linked changes in response bias, nor whether any such sensitivity benefit can be retained over time. We examined the influence of stimulation of the right inferior frontal cortex using tDCS on perceptual learning and retention in 37 healthy participants, using signal detection theory to distinguish effects on perceptual sensitivity (d′) from response bias (ß). Anodal stimulation with 2 mA increased d′, compared to a 0.1 mA sham stimulation control, with no effect on ß. On completion of training, participants in the active stimulation group had more than double the perceptual sensitivity of the control group. Furthermore, the performance enhancement was maintained for 24 hours. The results show that tDCS augments both skill acquisition and retention in a complex detection task and that the benefits are rooted in an improvement in sensitivity (d′), rather than changes in response bias (ß). Stimulation-driven acceleration of learning and its retention over 24 hours may result from increased activation of prefrontal cortical regions that provide top-down attentional control signals to object recognition areas."
https://openalex.org/W2039743143,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression and play an important role in cancer development and progression. However, little is known about the role of miRNAs in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Our objective is to decipher a miRNA expression signature associated with CML and to determine potential target genes and signaling pathways affected by these signature miRNAs.Using miRNA microarrays and miRNA real-time PCR we characterized the miRNAs expression profile of CML cell lines and patients in reference to non-CML cell lines and healthy blood. Of all miRNAs tested, miR-31, miR-155, and miR-564 were down-regulated in CML cells. Down-regulation of these miRNAs was dependent on BCR-ABL activity. We next analyzed predicted targets and affected pathways of the deregulated miRNAs. As expected, in K562 cells, the expression of several of these targets was inverted to that of the miRNA putatively regulating them. Reassuringly, the analysis identified CML as the main disease associated with these miRNAs. MAPK, ErbB, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were the main molecular pathways related with these expression patterns. Utilizing Venn diagrams we found appreciable overlap between the CML-related miRNAs and the signaling pathways-related miRNAs.The miRNAs identified in this study might offer a pivotal role in CML. Nevertheless, while these data point to a central disease, the precise molecular pathway/s targeted by these miRNAs is variable implying a high level of complexity of miRNA target selection and regulation. These deregulated miRNAs highlight new candidate gene targets allowing for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the development of CML, and propose possible new avenues for therapeutic treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2052062968,"Carbon assimilation in plants is regulated by the reduction of specific protein disulfides by light and their re-oxidation in the dark. The redox switch CP12 is an intrinsically disordered protein that can form two disulfide bridges. In the dark oxidized CP12 forms an inactive supramolecular complex with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and phosphoribulokinase, two enzymes of the carbon assimilation cycle. Here we show that binding of CP12 to GAPDH, the first step of ternary complex formation, follows an integrated mechanism that combines conformational selection with induced folding steps. Initially, a CP12 conformation characterized by a circular structural motif including the C-terminal disulfide is selected by GAPDH. Subsequently, the induced folding of the flexible C-terminal tail of CP12 in the active site of GAPDH stabilizes the binary complex. Formation of several hydrogen bonds compensates the entropic cost of CP12 fixation and terminates the interaction mechanism that contributes to carbon assimilation control."
https://openalex.org/W2019569543,"Other-regarding preferences are a critical feature of human cooperation but to what extent non-human animals exhibit these preferences is a matter of intense discussion. We tested whether jackdaws show prosocial behaviour (providing benefits to others at no cost to themselves) and altruism (providing benefits to others while incurring costs) with both sibling and non-sibling recipients. In the prosocial condition, a box was baited on both the actor's and the recipient's side (1/1 option), whereas another box provided food only for the actor (1/0 option). In the altruistic condition, the boxes contained food for either the actor (1/0 option) or the recipient (0/1 option). The proportion of selfish (1/0 option) and cooperative (1/1 and 0/1 option, respectively) actors' choices was significantly affected by the recipients' behaviour. If recipients approached the boxes first and positioned themselves next to the box baited on their side, trying to access the food reward (recipient-first trials), actors were significantly more cooperative than when the actors approached the boxes first and made their choice prior to the recipients' arrival (actor-first trials). Further, in recipient-first trials actors were more cooperative towards recipients of the opposite sex, an effect that was even more pronounced in the altruistic condition. Hence, at no cost to the actors, all recipients could significantly influence the actors' behaviour, whereas at high costs this could be achieved even more so by recipients of different sex. Local/stimulus enhancement is discussed as the most likely cognitive mechanism to account for these effects."
https://openalex.org/W2077159704,"Multivalent glycolipid binding toxins such as cholera toxin have the capacity to cluster glycolipids, a process thought to be important for their functional uptake into cells. In contrast to the highly dynamic properties of lipid probes and many lipid-anchored proteins, the B-subunit of cholera toxin (CTxB) diffuses extremely slowly when bound to its glycolipid receptor GM1 in the plasma membrane of living cells. In the current study, we used confocal FRAP to examine the origins of this slow diffusion of the CTxB/GM1 complex at the cell surface, relative to the behavior of a representative GPI-anchored protein, transmembrane protein, and fluorescent lipid analog. We show that the diffusion of CTxB is impeded by actin- and ATP-dependent processes, but is unaffected by caveolae. At physiological temperature, the diffusion of several cell surface markers is unchanged in the presence of CTxB, suggesting that binding of CTxB to membranes does not alter the organization of the plasma membrane in a way that influences the diffusion of other molecules. Furthermore, diffusion of the B-subunit of another glycolipid-binding toxin, Shiga toxin, is significantly faster than that of CTxB, indicating that the confined diffusion of CTxB is not a simple function of its ability to cluster glycolipids. By identifying underlying mechanisms that control CTxB dynamics at the cell surface, these findings help to delineate the fundamental properties of toxin-receptor complexes in intact cell membranes."
https://openalex.org/W1990876949,"The efficacy of gene silencing by plant microRNAs (miRNAs) is generally assumed to be predominantly determined by their abundance. In Arabidopsis the highly abundant miRNA, miR159, acts as a molecular “switch” in vegetative tissues completely silencing the expression of two GAMYB-like genes, MYB33 and MYB65. Here, we show that miR159 has a diminished silencing efficacy in the seed. Using reporter gene constructs, we determined that MIR159 and MYB33 are co-transcribed in the aleurone and embryo of germinating seeds. However in contrast to vegetative tissues, MYB33 is not completely silenced. Instead, miR159 appears to shape the spatio-temporal expression pattern of MYB33 during seed germination. Transcript profiling in a time course during seed germination in wild-type and a mir159 mutant in which miR159 is almost absent, revealed that transcript levels of the GAMYB-like genes were similar between these two genotypes during germination, but much higher in the mir159 mutant once germination had completed. This attenuation in the silencing of the GAMYB-like genes was not explained by a decrease in mature miR159 levels, which remained constant at all time points during seed germination. We propose that miR159 acts as a tuner of GAMYB-like levels in Arabidopsis germinating seeds and that the activity of this miRNA is attenuated in the seed compared to vegetative tissues. This implies that the efficacy of miRNA-mediated silencing is not solely determined by miRNA abundance and target transcript levels, but is being determined through additional mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2074665430,"Hepcidin antimicrobial peptide (HAMP) is a small cysteine-rich peptide and a key molecule of the innate immune system against bacterial infections. Molecular cloning and genomic characterization of HAMP gene in the miiuy croaker (Miichthys miiuy) were reported in this study. The miiuy croaker HAMP was predicted to encode a prepropeptide of 99 amino acids, a tentative RX(K/R)R cleavage motif and eight characteristic cysteine residues were also identified. The gene organization is also similar to corresponding genes in mammals and fish consisting of three exons and two introns. Sequence polymorphism analysis showed that only two different sequences were identified and encoded two proteins in six individuals. As reported for most other species, the expression level was highest in liver and an up-regulation of transcription was seen in spleen, intestine and kidney examined at 24 h after injection of pathogenic bacteria, Vibrio anguillarum, the expression pattern implied that miiuy croaker HAMP is an important component of the first line defense against invading pathogens. In addition, we report on the underlying mechanism that maintains sequences diversity among fish and mammalian species, respectively. A series of site-model tests implemented in the CODEML program revealed that moderate positive Darwinian selection is likely to cause the molecular evolution in the fish HAMP2 genes and it also showed that the fish HAMP1 genes and HAMP2 genes under different selection pressures."
https://openalex.org/W2010957958,"Experiments in mice deficient for Nurr1 or expressing the dominant-negative FGF receptor (FGFR) identified orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 and FGFR1 as essential factors in development of mesencephalic dopaminergic (mDA) neurons. FGFR1 affects brain cell development by two distinct mechanisms. Activation of cell surface FGFR1 by secreted FGFs stimulates proliferation of neural progenitor cells, whereas direct integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling (INFS) is associated with an exit from the cell cycle and neuronal differentiation. Both Nurr1 and INFS activate expression of neuronal genes, such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in dopamine synthesis. Here, we show that nuclear FGFR1 and Nurr1 are expressed in the nuclei of developing TH-positive cells in the embryonic ventral midbrain. Both nuclear receptors were effectively co-immunoprecipitated from the ventral midbrain of FGF-2-deficient embryonic mice, which previously showed an increase of mDA neurons and enhanced nuclear FGFR1 accumulation. Immunoprecipitation and co-localization experiments showed the presence of Nurr1 and FGFR1 in common nuclear protein complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated the Nurr1-mediated shift of nuclear FGFR1-EGFP mobility toward a transcriptionally active population and that both Nurr1 and FGFR1 bind to a common region in the TH gene promoter. Furthermore, nuclear FGFR1 or its 23-kDa FGF-2 ligand (FGF-2(23)) enhances Nurr1-dependent activation of the TH gene promoter. Transcriptional cooperation of FGFR1 with Nurr1 was confirmed on isolated Nurr1-binding elements. The proposed INFS/Nurr1 nuclear partnership provides a novel mechanism for TH gene regulation in mDA neurons and a potential therapeutic target in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders."
https://openalex.org/W1980355767,"We have recently demonstrated that O-linked glucosylation of thymine in trypanosome DNA (base J) regulates polymerase II transcription initiation. In vivo analysis has indicated that base J synthesis is initiated by the hydroxylation of thymidine by proteins (JBP1 and JBP2) homologous to the Fe2+/2-oxoglutarate (2-OG)-dependent dioxygenase superfamily where hydroxylation is driven by the oxidative decarboxylation of 2-OG, forming succinate and CO2. However, no direct evidence for hydroxylase activity has been reported for the JBP proteins. We now demonstrate recombinant JBP1 hydroxylates thymine specifically in the context of dsDNA in a Fe2+-, 2-OG-, and O2-dependent manner.

Step one involves the hydroxylation of thymine in DNA by a thymidine hydroxylase (TH) enzyme, forming 5-hydroxymethyluracil (hmU). This intermediate is then glucosylated by a glucosyltransferase forming base J. Although the glucosyltransferase has not been identified, two proteins involved in the first step (JBP1 and JBP2) (6Cross M. Kieft R. Sabatini R.

Family members are typically identified on a structural level by the presence of a jelly roll β-helix sheet that contains four key conserved residues involved in the binding of Fe2+ and 2-OG and are essential for catalytic activity (see for review, see Ref. 12Hausinger R.P.

The simultaneous deletion of both generated a cell line unable to synthesize the modified base unless the cells are fed hmU, confirming their importance in the first step of J synthesis (9Cliffe L.J.

Deletion of either JBP1 or JBP2 in T. cruzi and JBP2 in Leishmania tarentolae results in similar reductions in J levels as seen in T. brucei mutants (4Ekanayake D.K. Minning T. Weatherly B.

Attempts to delete both JBPs from L. tarentolae and T. cruzi have failed to date, leading to the proposal that base J is essential in these organisms. However, detailed characterization of the T. cruzi JBP1 KO cell line has elucidated an important function of base J in trypanosomes. Anti-J ChIP analysis indicated that whereas the remaining J in the T. cruzi JBP1 KO is located in telomeric DNA, base J is lost from the divergent and convergent strand-switch regions involved in Pol II initiation and termination, respectively. The loss of base J at transcription start sites coincides with a decrease in nucleosome abundance, increased histone acetylation, and increased Pol II occupancy at promoter regions (3Ekanayake D. Sabatini R. Epigenetic regulation of polymerase II transcription initiation in Trypanosoma cruzi.

This increase in Pol II recruitment correlates with an increased rate of transcription initiation and changes in gene expression (3Ekanayake D. Sabatini R. Epigenetic regulation of polymerase II transcription initiation in Trypanosoma cruzi. Modulation of nucleosome abundance, histone modification, and polymerase occupancy by O-linked thymine DNA glucosylation.Eukaryot. Cell. 2011; 10: 1465-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These studies indicate the importance of epigenetic regulation of Pol II transcription via DNA modification and chromatin structure in kinetoplastids as well as provide a mechanism for J regulation of trypanosome gene expression. Thus, characterization of the enzyme(s) regulating the hydroxylation of specific T-residues along the chromosome is critical for understanding the control of trypanosome gene expression. The Fe2+/2-OG-dependent dioxygenase enzyme family encompasses a large group of enzymes that catalyze the hydroxylation of a diverse variety of substrates, including but not limited to DNA, protein, RNA, and lipid (for review, see Ref. 12Hausinger R.P. Fe(II)/α-ketoglutarate-dependent hydroxylases and related enzymes.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2004; 39: 21-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Most dioxygenases utilize Fe2+ as a cofactor and 2-OG and oxygen (O2) as co-substrates with the reaction coupling oxidative decarboxylation of 2-OG to the hydroxylation of substrate. Succinate and carbon dioxide are released as byproducts. The requirement of enzyme activity for molecular O2 has suggested many of these dioxygenases function as direct O2 sensors (14Ozer A. Bruick R.K. Non-heme dioxygenases. Cellular sensors and regulators jelly rolled into one?.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 144-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 15Kaelin Jr., W.G. Ratcliffe P.J. Oxygen sensing by metazoans. The central role of the HIF hydroxylase pathway.Mol. Cell. 2008; 30: 393-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2192) Google Scholar). They may also be activated by the co-substrate 2-OG, a Krebs cycle intermediate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ and inhibited by the product succinate. Members of this dioxygenase enzyme family catalyze the demethylation of Nϵ-methyl lysine residues in histones and of N-methylated nucleic acids as well as hydroxylation of 5-methyl cytosine in DNA and 5-methoxycarbonylmethyluridine at the wobble position of tRNA. As such, dioxygenase enzymes have a broad range of biological roles, including DNA repair and O2 sensing and regulating gene expression (16Loenarz C. Schofield C.J. Expanding chemical biology of 2-oxoglutarate oxygenases.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 17Rose N.R. McDonough M.A. King O.N. Kawamura A. Schofield C.J.

A distant homolog of the JBP1/2 TH domain was recently identified in the mammalian protein TET1, which is found fused to the histone methyltransferase MLL gene during acute myeloid leukemia (11Tahiliani M. Koh K.P. Shen Y. Pastor W.A. Bandukwala H. Brudno Y. Agarwal S. Iyer L.M. Liu D.R. Aravind L. Rao A.

Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal, and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). TET1 (and the related TET2 and TET3 proteins) has been shown to convert 5-methylcytosine in DNA to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. This conversion may play an important role in the epigenetic control of gene expression in mammals (11Tahiliani M. Koh K.P. Shen Y. Pastor W.A. Bandukwala H. Brudno Y. Agarwal S. Iyer L.M. Liu D.R. Aravind L. Rao A. Conversion of 5-methylcytosine to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in mammalian DNA by MLL partner TET1.Science. 2009; 324: 930-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (4228) Google Scholar, 18Ito S.

Role of Tet proteins in 5mC to 5hmC conversion, ES-cell self-renewal, and inner cell mass specification.Nature. 2010; 466: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). Based on the sequence similarity, JBP and TET proteins have been grouped together in the TET/JBP subfamily of dioxygenases (10Iyer L.M. Tahiliani M. Rao A. Aravind L. Prediction of novel families of enzymes involved in oxidative and other complex modifications of bases in nucleic acids.Cell Cycle. 2009; 8: 1698-1710Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Although the characterization of the JBP enzymes in vivo has proven to be useful in confirming their importance in J biosynthesis and elucidating the function of base J, TH activity has not yet been demonstrated for JBP in vitro. Here we develop an in vitro assay to demonstrate that JBP hydroxylation of thymine residues in dsDNA is dependent on Fe2+, 2-OG, and O2. We show rJBP1 binds Fe2+, and mutation of the two conserved metal binding ligands of dioxygenases results in the loss of Fe2+ binding and inability to hydroxylate thymidine. Competitive inhibitors of 2-OG significantly reduce JBP activity both in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, this data confirm the identity of the JBPs as Fe2+/2-OG-dependent dioxygenases and provide direct evidence for the two-step J-biosynthesis pathway of modifying T-residues in kinetoplastid DNA. Furthermore, the O2 requirement for JBP1-stimulated hydroxylation in vitro and J synthesis in vivo and the corresponding changes in T. cruzi virulence suggest the oxygen regulation of JBP enzyme activity to be important in allowing the parasite to adapt to changing host conditions during its lifecycle. Blood stream form T. brucei cell line 221a of strain 427 were cultured as described previously (7DiPaolo C. Kieft R. Cross M. Sabatini R.

Promastigote L. major cells were grown at 26 °C in M199 media supplemented with 10% FBS as described (19Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M.

Y strain T. cruzi wild-type (WT) and JBP1 double knock-out epimastigotes were grown in liver infusion tryptose medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum as previously described (4Ekanayake D.K. Minning T. Weatherly B. Gunasekera K. Nilsson D. Tarleton R. Ochsenreiter T. Sabatini R. Epigenetic regulation of transcription and virulence in Trypanosoma cruzi by O-linked thymine glucosylation of DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1690-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes were differentiated to infective metacyclics as described (20Wilson 3rd, D.M. Takeshita M. Demple B.

For in vivo inhibition of TH activity, cells were grown in the presence of dimethyloxoglycine (DMOG) (Frontier Scientific), 2,4-pyridinedicarboxylic acid hydrate (Acros Organics), or DMSO as indicated in Fig. 4 (inhibitor stocks were made up in 25% DMSO). As a control, parasites were grown in medium with comparable DMSO concentrations as cultures with the highest level of diluted inhibitor. Recombinant His-tagged L. tarentolae JBP1 (Lt-JBP1) was produced essentially as previously described (8Yu Z. Genest P.A. ter Riet B. Sweeney K. DiPaolo C. Kieft R. Christodoulou E. Perrakis A.

The Lt-JBP1 vector was transformed to BL21-DE3 T1R (21Sigman D.S. Kuwabara M.D. Chen C.H. Bruice T.W. Nuclease activity of 1,10-phenanthroline-copper in study of protein-DNA interactions.Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 414-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Protein production was induced when cells reached an optical density of 0.6–0.9 with 0.3 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for 16 h. rJBP1 was purified over a Talon resin column eluted with 600 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, and 200 mm imidazole followed by dialysis in 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA for 3 h. Protein was then subject to further dialysis (ON) in 50 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl. Purified protein, >95% pure as judged by SDS-PAGE, was concentrated by Centricon. Fe2+ binding analysis was carried out using 250 μm rJBP1, 100 mm dithionite, 240 μm Fe2SO4, 1 mm 2-OG, and 1 mm ascorbic acid essentially as previously described (22Ryle M.J. Padmakumar R. Hausinger R.P. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of Escherichia coli taurine/α-ketoglutarate dioxygenase. Interactions with α-ketoglutarate, taurine, and oxygen.Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15278-15286Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). All solutions were made anaerobic by several rounds of vacuum degassing and flushing with argon using a vacuum manifold and sealed serum vials. The reaction mixture was then read from 200 to 800 nm in a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette fitted with a stopper and purged with argon. After blanking against JBP1, we recorded spectra for samples to which anaerobic aliquots of Fe2+ and 2-OG were added. No significant absorption between 400 and 750 nm was detected for the reaction buffer containing Fe2+ and 2-OG without JBP1. Reaction conditions were 50 mm HEPES (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 8 mm ascorbic acid, 4 mm 2-OG, 1 mm Fe2SO4, 1 mm ATP, 20 μg/ml BSA, 0.5 mm DTT, 3.5 μg of telomeric duplex DNA substrate, and 2.2 μm JBP1 in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. DNA duplexes were made by boiling complementary telomere oligos (top strand 5′-TGGGATTTGGATTTGGATTTGGAT-3′; bottom strand 5′-ATCCCAATCCCAATCCCAATCCCA3′) for 5 min and allowed to cool overnight. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and DNA was isolated using the Qiagen nucleotide removal kit. Detection of 5-hydroxymethyl-2′-deoxyuridine (hmdU) was performed by immunoprecipitation of 32P-labeled mononucleotides using a hmdU-specific goat-polyclonal antibody (Abcam) as previously described (9Cliffe L.J. Kieft R. Southern T. Birkeland S.R. Marshall M. Sweeney K. Sabatini R. JBP1 and JBP2 are two distinct thymidine hydroxylases involved in J biosynthesis in genomic DNA of African trypanosomes.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 1452-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. DNA was digested with 0.2 units of bovine spleen phosphodiesterase (SPD) and 50 units of micrococcal nuclease (MNase) (Worthington) overnight at 37 °C, and nucleotides were phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). Nucleotide substrate (3.5 μg) was incubated with antibody for 2 h at room temperature with agitation. One hundred microliters of magnetic beads (Genscript) were then added for an additional 2 h. After stringent washing, beads were added to scintillation fluid, and cpm was measured. Assays were performed in triplicate. To grow cells in a hypoxic environment, 50-ml culture flasks were placed in anaerobic chambers (BD Biosciences) with an Aneropak pouch (Mitsubishi Gas Chemical Co.). Generation of hypoxic environment was confirmed using indicator strip. For growing cells at 1 or 3% O2, culture flasks were placed in anaerobic chambers and gas-exchanged by an evacuation-replacement procedure using premixed 1 or 3% O2 with 5% CO2 and balanced nitrogen. A continuous flow of gas was then applied for at least 5 min followed by daily gassing. To maintain hypoxic environment, hypoxia-treated cells were harvested and lysed inside the anaerobic chamber (Coy) to avoid reoxygenation. Samples were then processed for RNA/DNA under atmospheric O2 conditions. T. cruzi epimastigotes grown under hypoxic conditions as described above for 10 days were transferred to hypoxic Grace's insect media (Invitrogen; made anaerobic by vacuum degassing and flushing with argon) for 14 days to differentiate to infective metacyclics as previously described (4Ekanayake D.K. Minning T. Weatherly B. Gunasekera K. Nilsson D. Tarleton R. Ochsenreiter T. Sabatini R. Epigenetic regulation of transcription and virulence in Trypanosoma cruzi by O-linked thymine glucosylation of DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1690-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Epimastigotes that were grown at 21% O2 were differentiated in a similar procedure but under atmospheric O2 conditions. Differentiated metacyclic parasites (from 21% O2 and hypoxic conditions) were then purified, equal numbers of infective metacyclic parasites were incubated with vero cells for 3 h, and parasite invasion was quantitated as previously described at 21% O2 conditions (4Ekanayake D.K. Minning T. Weatherly B. Gunasekera K. Nilsson D. Tarleton R. Ochsenreiter T. Sabatini R. Epigenetic regulation of transcription and virulence in Trypanosoma cruzi by O-linked thymine glucosylation of DNA.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2011; 31: 1690-1700Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, vero cells were plated on 13-mm round coverslips at a density of 3 × 104 cells in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium with 10% fetal calf serum and cultivated in 24-well plates for 24 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere and 21% oxygen. Coverslips with attached cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the unattached cells and debris. Purified metacyclic forms were used for invasion assays. Purified metacyclics from each growth condition were centrifuged to remove the cell debris and seeded onto the Vero cells in equal numbers (5 × 106 parasites/well). After 3 h at 37 °C, the interaction was stopped by removing the parasites, and washing the cells three times with PBS. Monolayers were fixed and stained with Giemsa stain. Invasion was quantified using two methods. The percentage of infected cells was calculated by counting the number of intracellular parasites per coverslip and expressed as the number of parasites per 100 Vero cells. We also determined the average number of parasites per infected cell by counting the number of parasites in ∼90 infected Vero cells for each experiment. After the incubation of dsDNA substrate with or without JBP1 enzyme in the TH assay as described above, the purified DNA was digested to nucleosides and subjected to liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. The enzymatic digestion of the duplex DNA substrate was conducted following previously described procedures with some modifications (23Wang J. Yuan B. Guerrero C. Bahde R. Gupta S. Wang Y. Quantification of oxidative DNA lesions in tissues of Long-Evans cinnamon rats by capillary high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope-dilution method.Anal.

Nuclease P1 (4 units), phosphodiesterase 2 (0.005 units), erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl) adenine (20 nmol), and a 20-μl solution containing 300 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.6) and 10 mm zinc chloride were added to the DNA and incubated at 37 °C for 48 h. To the digestion mixture were then added alkaline phosphatase (2 units), phosphodiesterase 1 (0.005 units), and 40 μl of 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.9). The digestion was continued at 37 °C for 2 h and subsequently neutralized with formic acid. To the mixture were then added 1.5 pmol of isotopically labeled hmdU (24Hong H. Cao H. Wang Y. Wang Y.

The enzymes in the digestion mixture were subsequently removed by chloroform extraction twice, and the resulting aqueous layer was subjected to off-line HPLC enrichment of hmdU. A 4.6 × 250-mm Alltima HP C18 column (5 μm in particle size, Grace Davison, Deerfield, IL) was used for the enrichment of hmdU from the enzymatic digestion products of DNA. The mobile phases were 10 mm ammonium formate in water (solution A) and methanol (solution B), and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. A gradient of 42 min at 0% B, 1 min at 0–5% B, 22 min at 5% B, 5 min at 5–20% B, and 10 min at 20% B was employed. A typical HPLC trace is shown in supplemental Fig. S3A. The HPLC fractions eluting at 18.0–24.0 min were pooled for hmdU. The collected fractions were dried in the SpeedVac, redissolved in H2O, and subjected for LC-"
https://openalex.org/W2014139731,"Background The commercial release of rice genetically engineered to express a Cry1Ab protein from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) for control of Lepidoptera in China is a subject of debate. One major point of the debate has focused on the ecological safety of Bt rice on nontarget organisms, especially predators and parasitoids that help control populations of insect pests. Methodology/Principal Findings A tritrophic bioassay was conducted to evaluate the potential impact of Cry1Ab-expressing rice on fitness parameters of a predaceous ground spider (Pardosa pseudoannulata (Bösenberg et Strand)) that had fed on Bt rice-fed brown planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)) nymphs. Survival, development time and fecundity of this spider were not different when they were fed with Bt rice-fed or non-Bt rice-fed prey. Furthermore, ELISA and PCR gut assays, as well as a functional response trial, indicated that predation by P. pseudoannulata was not significantly different in Bt rice or non-Bt rice fields. Conclusions/Significance The transgenic Cry1Ab rice lines tested in this study had no adverse effects on the survival, developmental time and fecundity of P. pseudoannulata in the laboratory or on predation under field conditions. This suggests that this important predator would not be harmed if transgenic Cry1Ab rice were commercialized."
https://openalex.org/W2169728124,"Mitochondrial genomes have maintained some bacterial features despite their residence within eukaryotic cells for approximately two billion years. One of these features is the frequent presence of polycistronic operons. In land plants, however, it has been shown that all sequenced vascular plant chondromes lack large polycistronic operons while bryophyte chondromes have many of them. In this study, we provide the completely sequenced mitochondrial genome of a lycophyte, from Huperzia squarrosa, which is a member of the sister group to all other vascular plants. The genome, at a size of 413,530 base pairs, contains 66 genes and 32 group II introns. In addition, it has 69 pseudogene fragments for 24 of the 40 protein- and rRNA-coding genes. It represents the most archaic form of mitochondrial genomes of all vascular plants. In particular, it has one large conserved gene cluster containing up to 10 ribosomal protein genes, which likely represents a polycistronic operon but has been disrupted and greatly reduced in the chondromes of other vascular plants. It also has the least rearranged gene order in comparison to the chondromes of other vascular plants. The genome is ancestral in vascular plants in several other aspects: the gene content resembling those of charophytes and most bryophytes, all introns being cis-spliced, a low level of RNA editing, and lack of foreign DNA of chloroplast or nuclear origin."
https://openalex.org/W2128410594,"The p53 gene encodes a transcription factor that is composed of several functional domains: the N-terminal transactivation domain, the central sequence-specific DNA binding domain, the tetramerization domain, and the highly basic C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). The p53 CTD is a nonspecific DNA binding domain that is subject to extensive post-translational modifications. However, the functional significance of the p53 CTD remains unclear. The role of this domain in the regulation of p53 functions is explored by comparing the activity of ectopically expressed wild-type (WT) p53 protein to that of a truncated mutant lacking the 24 terminal amino acids (Δ24). Using quantitative real time PCR and chromatin Immuno-Precipitation experiments, a p53 CTD deletion is shown to alter the p53-dependent induction of a subset of its target genes due to impaired specific DNA binding. Moreover, p53-induced growth arrest and apoptosis both require an intact p53 CTD. These data indicate that the p53 CTD is a positive regulator of p53 tumor suppressor functions. The p53 gene encodes a transcription factor that is composed of several functional domains: the N-terminal transactivation domain, the central sequence-specific DNA binding domain, the tetramerization domain, and the highly basic C-terminal regulatory domain (CTD). The p53 CTD is a nonspecific DNA binding domain that is subject to extensive post-translational modifications. However, the functional significance of the p53 CTD remains unclear. The role of this domain in the regulation of p53 functions is explored by comparing the activity of ectopically expressed wild-type (WT) p53 protein to that of a truncated mutant lacking the 24 terminal amino acids (Δ24). Using quantitative real time PCR and chromatin Immuno-Precipitation experiments, a p53 CTD deletion is shown to alter the p53-dependent induction of a subset of its target genes due to impaired specific DNA binding. Moreover, p53-induced growth arrest and apoptosis both require an intact p53 CTD. These data indicate that the p53 CTD is a positive regulator of p53 tumor suppressor functions. p53 is a well characterized tumor suppressor protein whose activity is regulated tightly (1Vousden K.H. Prives C. Blinded by the light: The growing complexity of p53.Cell. 2009; 137: 413-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2315) Google Scholar). This protein consists of several domains, each specialized in different functions. The N terminus contains its transactivation domain; the central region of the protein corresponds to its sequence-specific DNA binding domain, which is followed by a tetramerization domain; a relatively short but highly basic domain constitutes the C terminus. The p53 carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) 2abbreviations used are: CTDcarboxyl-terminal domainMDM2mouse double minute 2 gene. is conserved highly in vertebrates but shows significant divergence in lower organisms, suggesting a functional significance that appeared at a late stage during evolution (2Ou H.D.

Initial investigations into p53 CTD function suggested that the CTD was at best not required for p53 tumor suppressor function (3Pellegata N.S. Cajot J.F. Stanbridge E.J. The basic carboxyl-terminal domain of human p53 is dispensable for both transcriptional regulation and inhibition of tumor cell growth.Oncogene. 1995; 11: 337-349PubMed Google Scholar) or perhaps a negative regulator of p53 activity (3Pellegata N.S.

Later, others showed that this basic region (containing six lysines in humans, seven in mice) was a target of MDM2-mediated ubiquitination as part of an autoregulatory negative feedback loop leading to the degradation of p53 and consequent down-regulation of its activities (5Kubbutat M.H. Ludwig R.L. Ashcroft M. Vousden K.H. Regulation of Mdm2-directed degradation by the C terminus of p53.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 5690-5698Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Furthermore, studies using the CTD in EMSA experiments showed that p53 binds DNA with higher affinity without its C-terminal moiety (4Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P.

Allosteric activation of latent p53 tetramers.Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 865-875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). More recently, however, several laboratories used either in vitro transcription assays to show that a ΔCTD mutant does not activate p21 transcription (7Espinosa J.M. Emerson B.M. Transcriptional regulation by p53 through intrinsic DNA/chromatin binding and site-directed cofactor recruitment.Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 57-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) or cellular chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to demonstrate that this mutant does not bind to its target genes in the context of chromatin (8McKinney K. Mattia M. Gottifredi V. Prives C. p53 linear diffusion along DNA requires its C terminus.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Together, these data argue that the p53 CTD is, in fact, required for promoter binding in a cellular context. This conclusion was supported by the finding that the p53 CTD binds to DNA in a nonspecific manner and stimulates p53 linear “fast sliding” on DNA, thereby facilitating the search by the core domain for specific binding sites (8McKinney K.

In addition to being ubiquitinated, the six lysines in the human p53 CTD are all modified by one of several additional post-translational marks, including acetylation, methylation, or sumoylation (reviewed in Ref. 12Olsson A.

It was first thought that the acetylation of these lysines counteracts their ubiquitination, thus stabilizing the protein and enabling p53 activation (13Avantaggiati M.L. Ogryzko V. Gardner K.

DNA damage activates p53 through a phosphorylation-acetylation cascade.Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been proposed that p53 CTD acetylation may play a key role in what has been called antirepression, a mechanism by which p53 is released from repressive interactions with factors such as MDM2 or MDMX (17Kruse J.P. Gu W. Modes of p53 regulation.Cell. 2009; 137: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar, 18Tang Y. Zhao W. Chen Y. Zhao Y. Gu W. Acetylation is indispensable for p53 activation.Cell. 2008; 133: 612-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, mouse models in which either six or seven of these lysines were mutated to arginines revealed no obvious phenotype (19Feng L. Lin T. Uranishi H. Gu W. Xu Y.

U.S.A. 2005; 102: 10188-10193Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The p53 CTD is also phosphorylated on several residues, but the relevance of these phosphorylations also is unclear (12Olsson A. Manzl C. Strasser A. Villunger A.

Anderson C.W. Signaling to p53: breaking the posttranslational modification code.Pathol. Biol. 2000; 48: 227-245PubMed Google Scholar). An S389A mutation in the mouse (Ser-392 in humans) has indeed only minor defects in p53 functions (22Bruins W. Bruning O. Jonker M.J. Zwart E. van der Hoeven T.V. Pennings J.L.

Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 1974-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The expression of alternatively spliced forms of the p53 CTD has been shown in the mouse (23Arai N. Nomura D. Yokota K.

The human tumor suppressor gene p53 is alternatively spliced in normal cells.Oncogene. 1996; 12: 813-818PubMed Google Scholar), but the several alternative protein isoforms encoded by the human p53 gene have been described fully only recently (27Bourdon J.C. Fernandes K. Murray-Zmijewski F. Liu G. Diot A. Xirodimas D.P. Saville M.K. Lane D.P. p53 isoforms can regulate p53 transcriptional activity.Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2122-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). There are at least three different CTDs encoded by the WT p53 gene: p53α CTD (full-length protein), p53β CTD (which has a 52-amino acid C-terminal deletion), and p53γ CTD (which has a 47-amino acid C-terminal deletion) (28Khoury M.P. Bourdon J.C. The isoforms of the p53 protein.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000927Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Although their different roles remain to be determined fully (29Fujita K. Mondal A.M. Horikawa I. Nguyen G.H. Kumamoto K. Sohn J.J. Bowman E.D. Mathe E.A. Schetter A.J. Pine S.R. Ji H. Vojtesek B.

Cancer. 2007; 97: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 32Goldschneider D. Horvilleur E. Plassa L.F. Guillaud-Bataille M. Million K. Wittmer-Dupret E. Danglot G. de Thé H. Bénard J.

Expression of C-terminal deleted p53 isoforms in neuroblastoma.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 5603-5612Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), raising the intriguing possibility that they play a role in tumor development. Although an important body of data has been generated over the years from studying the p53 CTD, its functional significance remains elusive. Here, we compare the activity of ectopically expressed wild-type p53 to that of a truncated mutant lacking the terminal 24 amino acids (Δ24) and show that deletion of the p53 CTD affects the ability of p53 to bind to the promoters of a subset of its target genes. Furthermore, p53Δ24 is unable to induce critical p53 functions, such as apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. These data support an obligatory and positive role for the p53 CTD in p53 tumor suppressor functions. p53 WT or mutant constructs were all derived from a pCMV-FLAG-p53 plasmid, a gift from Dr. Wei Gu. The Δ24 deletion was created in the p53 moiety by introducing a stop codon at the 370 position with oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis using the Pfu-DNA polymerase and the following pair of primers: 5′- ACTCCAGCCACCTGTAGTCCAAAAAGGGTC-3′ and 5′- GACCCTTTTTGGACTACAGGTGGCTGGAGT-3′. The p53prom-p53 plasmid was derived from the pcDNA5/FRT expression vector (Invitrogen). Briefly, a BamHI-p53-cDNA-BamHI fragment from the pC53-SN3 plasmid (a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein) was cloned in the BamHI site of the multiple cloning site of pcDNA5/FRT. The CMV promoter was removed by cutting the resulting vector with MluI and NheI. An MluI-p53-promoter-NheI fragment was then inserted in these sites after being generated by PCR from the hp1p-luc plasmid (a gift from Dr. David Reisman) using the following primers 5′- GAATTCACGCGTGGAGTAGGCAGAAG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGCTAGCCAATCCAGGGAAGC-3′. All constructions were verified by DNA sequencing. H1299, SAOS2, U2OS, and HCT116 cell lines were purchased from ATCC. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. H1299 were transfected using a combination of LipofectamineTM and PlusTM Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HCT116 and U2OS cell lines were treated with doxorubicin (Sigma) as indicated. Cells were washed and harvested in PBS and then lysed in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 50 μg/ml aprotinin. Equal amounts of total protein, typically 50 μg, were electrophoresed by use of sodium SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad), and blotted with anti-p53 (DO-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p21 (SMX30; BD Pharmingen), anti-MDM2 (SMP14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-BAX (N20 and P19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-GFP (JL-8; BD Biosciences), and anti-actin (Ab-1; Calbiochem). The signal was detected using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) Western blotting substrate from Pierce/Thermo Scientific. Assays were performed essentially as described by Espinosa et al. (33Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. p53 functions through stress- and promoter-specific recruitment of transcription initiation components before and after DNA damage.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) using anti-p53 antibody (DO-1 and FL393; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Recovered DNA was submitted for real-time PCR amplification using a Mx3005P quantitative PCR system (Agilent Technologies). Relative binding values (% of input) were calculated using the comparative cycle threshold method (2−ΔΔCt). Primers used for ChIP quantitative PCR are listed in supplemental Table 1 (Operon Biotechnologies, Inc.). All results are presented as mean ± S.E. representing at least three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed by calculating p values using an unpaired Student's t test (two-tailed). RNA was extracted using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen). Immediately after extraction, 1 to 2 μg of RNA was used for cDNA synthesis with qScriptTM cDNA SuperMix (Quanta Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 40-cycle quantitative real-time PCR was then performed using PCR primers sets presented in supplemental Table 1 (Operon Biotechnologies, Inc.). GAPDH mRNA was used as an internal standard for normalization, using the 2−ΔΔCt method. 24 h after transfection, H1299 cells grown on coverslips, were fixed with formaldehyde (4% in PBS) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The anti-p53 monoclonal (DO1) was used at 1/1000 dilution in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, the coverslips were washed three times in PBS 0.1% Triton X-100 and then incubated 1 h at room temperature with Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG at concentration recommended by the supplier (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies) (1:500). After incubation, the coverslips were washed one time in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and three times in PBS. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (Sigma). After staining, the coverslips were mounted in Fluoromount-G (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and analyzed with a Nikon E-700 epifluorescence photomicroscope (Tokyo, Japan) using a Diagnostic Instruments, Inc. RT-SE SPOT digital camera. Image enhancement software (Adobe Photoshop CS5) was used to balance signal strength and to separate signal from noise. TUNEL assay was performed using the in situ cell death detection kit, TMR red from Roche Applied Science, and following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were pulsed with BrdU, which was added to the culture medium at a 10 μm final concentration for 6 h before harvesting. Cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) and washed three times with PBS. Cells were then incubated 30 min with 2 m HCl and neutralized for 2 min with 0.1 m sodium borate, pH 8.5, at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, 2% BSA in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (BD Biosciences). After three washes with PBS/BSA, cells were incubated with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes, Invitrogen Detection Technologies). DNA was counterstained with DAPI (Sigma) before mounting the slides. Each of the plasmids expressing p53prom-p53 WT, p53prom-p53Δ24 or an empty vector was co-transfected with a plasmid conferring puromycin resistance into exponentially growing HCT116 cells using LipofectamineTM reagent and PlusTM reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, the cells were subjected to puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection for 12–14 days. The colonies were fixed and stained with Giemsa (Sigma-Aldrich). To clarify the role of the p53 CTD, the activity of exogenously overexpressed p53 WT was compared with the activity of a deletion mutant that lacks the terminal 24-amino acid residues (Δ24) in a p53-null cell line (H1299, colon carcinoma) (Fig. 1A). Under conditions in which the protein levels of p53 WT and Δ24 were similar, the induction of several p53 target genes was assessed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1B, in the absence of stimuli such as DNA damage or hypoxia, overexpression of p53 WT is sufficient to induce expression of p53 target genes, including p21, MDM2, or BAX. Deletion of the last 24 amino acids of p53, however, has a distinct effect on p53 target genes expression levels. In contrast to MDM2 and BAX, p21 is poorly induced by p53Δ24. To assess whether or not this effect was due to a change in p53 localization, we performed immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 1C). After transfection in H1299 cells, p53 WT and p53Δ24 are indeed both localized in the nucleus. Together, these results argue that the p53 CTD may, in fact, influence p53 target gene selectivity. The mRNA levels of several p53 target genes were then assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and normalized to that of GAPDH (Fig. 2). A representative matching immunoblot is presented in Fig. 2D. The mRNA expression levels of five of eight target genes were different and suggested a requirement for the p53 CTD in their transcriptional regulation (Fig. 2, A and B). The remaining three genes (Fig. 2C) did not show any statistically significant difference between the WT and Δ24 induction. BAX, a proapoptotic gene (34Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Tumor suppressor p53 is a direct transcriptional activator of the human bax gene.Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), and MDM2 were not affected by the deletion of p53 CTD, in agreement with what was seen at the protein level. GADD45A, a prosurvival target gene that contributes to the maintenance of genomic stability (35Hollander M.C. Sheikh M.S. Bulavin D.V. Lundgren K. Augeri-Henmueller L. Shehee R. Molinaro T.A.

Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), also seemed unaffected by p53 CTD deletion. As expected, p21 mRNA and protein levels showed a clear correlation. Other target genes that showed a decreased induction by p53Δ24 were the proapoptotic genes PUMA (36Nakano K. Vousden K.H. PUMA, a novel proapoptotic gene, is induced by p53.Mol.

Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. A model for p53-induced apoptosis.Nature. 1997; 389: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2238) Google Scholar) and the prosurvival genes TIGAR (39Bensaad K. Tsuruta A. Selak M.A. Vidal M.N. Nakano K. Bartrons R. Gottlieb E. Vousden K.H. TIGAR, a p53-inducible regulator of glycolysis and apoptosis.Cell. 2006; 126: 107-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1505) Google Scholar) and SESN2 (40Budanov A.V. Sablina A.A. Feinstein E. Koonin E.V. Chumakov P.M. Regeneration of peroxiredoxins by p53-regulated sestrins, homologs of bacterial AhpD.Science. 2004; 304: 596-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These data suggest that deletion of the p53 CTD influences its transactivation functions but does not discriminate between proapoptotic or prosurvival genes. To further demonstrate the importance of the p53 CTD in p53 transactivation functions, the mRNA levels of several p53 target genes were also assessed in a second p53-null cell line (SAOS2, osteosarcoma) (supplemental Fig. 2). As observed in H1299, the p53Δ24 mutant had a decreased (supplemental Fig. 2A) or a similar (supplemental Fig. 2C) activity on several target genes. A representative immunoblot shown in supplemental Fig. 2D confirms these observations. However, in the case of PUMA and SESN2, no statistically significant difference between the WT and the Δ24 induction was observed (supplemental Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data suggest that the role that the p53 CTD plays in p53 transactivation functions is cell type specific for a subset of its target genes. The p53 CTD is a nonspecific DNA binding domain that has been shown to facilitate sequence-specific p53 binding to its target genes. It has also been shown to recruit transcriptional cofactors that exert selective influences on p53 target genes. To further understand how the p53 CTD may be involved in target gene selectivity, we performed a series of ChIP experiments. The p21 gene is under the control of a promoter that contains two p53 responsive elements, namely the 5′ and 3′ sites. There are two additional p53-responsive elements in the first intron of the gene, sites B and C (Fig. 3A). First, the binding of p53 to the 5′ and 3′ site was assessed using either a monoclonal antibody to p53 (DO1) or no antibody as a control. In both cases, under conditions where p53 WT and p53Δ24 proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 3C), the deletion of the last 24 amino acids of the protein impaired its binding to these responsive elements (Fig. 3A, left panels). Next, using a polyclonal antibody to p53 (FL393), the binding of p53 to the four p53 responsive elements of the p21 gene was assessed. As seen in Fig. 3A (5′ site and 3′ site, middle panels; sites B and C, right panels), deletion of the p53 CTD impairs p53 occupancy on all four sites. This is in agreement with a decrease in p21 mRNA expression, as shown in Fig. 2A. To confirm that this impaired DNA binding ability was not restricted to p21 responsive elements alone, the binding of p53 to PUMA was also assessed (supplemental Fig. 1A). Similar to what was observed for p21, p53Δ24 was seen to bind with less affinity to the p53-responsive elements of this target gene compared with the full-length protein. Next, the binding of p53 to the responsive elements of the target genes whose expression were not affected by the deletion of the last 24 amino acids was assessed. For MDM2, p53 has been shown to bind to two responsive elements located in the first intron, in proximity to the second transcription start site and exon 2 (Fig. 3B). These two responsive elements are too close to each other to be discriminated by PCR after ChIP. Thus, the combination of primers used for this experiment encompasses both sites. Using two different antibodies (monoclonal DO1 or polyclonal FL393), p53Δ24 was observed to have lost part of its ability to bind to the responsive elements, compared with the WT protein (∼2-fold less). These data do not correlate with the results seen with MDM2 mRNA induction (Fig. 2B). This apparent discrepancy could be explain by the fact that the impaired ability of p53Δ24 to bind to the MDM2 promoter might still be sufficient to induce the transcription of this gene. Indeed, p53Δ24 was also shown to have impaired binding to p53-responsive element in the first intron of the BAX gene (supplemental Fig. 1B), although it remained able to induce BAX both at the mRNA and the protein levels (Figs. 1B and 2B). Taken together, these data argue that the CTD is essential for the binding of p53 to all the target genes tested here, although to a extent that varies from one gene to another. MDM2 appears to be the target gene for which p53Δ24 retains the highest binding capability. To further explore the biological significance of these results, two sets of experiments were performed to assess two major cellular outcomes in response to p53, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. First, p53-induced apoptosis was assessed by measuring DNA fragmentation via labeling the terminal end of nucleic acids (TUNEL assay). This assay was performed after cotransfecting H1299 with expression vectors for GFP and either p53 WT or Δ24 (Fig. 4, A and B). As shown in Fig. 4A, in cells in which GFP is expressed (and presumably p53), only the WT protein is able to induce apoptosis. After quantification (Fig. 4B), it appears that p53 WT was able to induce apoptosis in ∼15% of the GFP-positive cells, whereas the Δ24 mutant did not appear to be significantly different from the control experiment (<5%). Second, the ability of p53 to induce a cell cycle arrest was assessed by monitoring DNA synthesis by means of a BrdU incorporation assay (Fig. 4, C and D). Again, among the GFP-positive cells, fewer BrdU-positive cells were observed after transfection with a plasmid expressing 53WT than with one for p53Δ24 (Fig. 4C). Quantification of these findings (Fig. 4D showed 44% of the cells growing after transfection with p53 WT compared with 62% with p53Δ24. Although the difference in the observed effect between the WT and the mutant was less striking than that which we had observed in the TUNEL assay, it was still statistically significant (p < 0.05). These results suggest that the CTD is critical for both activities of p53. There was a concern that the levels of p53 being achieved in these experiments may be non-physiological. To address this, the expression level achieved with the pCMV-p53 construct was compared with that of a p53prom-p53 plasmid, where the p53 cDNA is under the control of the native p53 promoter. This resulted in low levels of p53 expression in transfected H1299 cells, as shown in Fig. 5A. Protein expression levels in"

While insect elicitors (IE) abundant in the oral secretions of the attacking herbivore are essential in the regulation of induced defenses, little is known about their effects on systemic defense signaling in maize (Zea mays). The goal of this study was therefore to identify genetic markers that can be used to further characterize local and systemic signaling events induced by IE or mechanical wounding (MW). We selected genes for this study based on their putative involvement in signaling (allene oxide synthase), regulation of gene expression (transcription factor MYC7), and in direct defenses (ribosome inactivating protein) and analyzed their expression in different sections of the treated leaf as well as in systemic parts of the same plant. We found the most significant transcript accumulation of the selected genes after treatment with insect elicitors in those parts with increased JA levels. Additionally, treatment with IE did also induce the accumulation of MYC7 transcripts in basal parts of the treated leaf and systemically. MW, in contrast, did induce RIP and AOS only locally, but not MYC7. This local suppression of MYC7 was further studied by adding glutathione (GSH) as an electron donor to MW plants to quench putative α, β-unsaturated carbonyls, which build up to significant levels around the damage site. Indeed, GSH-treated MW plants accumulated MYC7 at the damage site and also produced more volatiles, suggesting a putative redox-regulatory element being involved in the suppression of MYC7. The results presented herein provide evidence for the specific induction of distant signaling events triggered by IE, most likely through electric signaling. Additionally, a putative role for MW-induced α, β-unsaturated carbonyls in the transcriptional regulation of defense genes was discovered."

This unequal distribution of lipids between leaflets is, amongst several proposed functions, hypothesized to be a prerequisite for endocytosis. P4 ATPases, belonging to the P-type ATPase superfamily of pumps, are involved in establishing lipid asymmetry across plasma membranes, but P4 ATPases have not been identified in plant plasma membranes. Here we report that the plant P4 ATPase ALA1, which previously has been connected with cold tolerance of Arabidopsis thaliana, is targeted to the plasma membrane and does so following association in the endoplasmic reticulum with an ALIS protein β-subunit."

Adult T. pisiformis (canines as definitive hosts) and Cysticercus pisiformis (rabbits as intermediate hosts) cause significant health problems to the host and considerable socio-economic losses as a consequence. No complete genomic data regarding T. pisiformis are currently available in public databases. RNA-seq provides an effective approach to analyze the eukaryotic transcriptome to generate large functional gene datasets that can be used for further studies.In this study, 2.67 million sequencing clean reads and 72,957 unigenes were generated using the RNA-seq technique. Based on a sequence similarity search with known proteins, a total of 26,012 unigenes (no redundancy) were identified after quality control procedures via the alignment of four databases. Overall, 15,920 unigenes were mapped to 203 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Through analyzing the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and axonal guidance pathways, we achieved an in-depth understanding of the biochemistry of T. pisiformis. Here, we selected four unigenes at random and obtained their full-length cDNA clones using RACE PCR. Functional distribution characteristics were gained through comparing four cestode species (72,957 unigenes of T. pisiformis, 30,700 ESTs of T. solium, 1,058 ESTs of Eg+Em [conserved ESTs between Echinococcus granulosus and Echinococcus multilocularis]), with the cluster of orthologous groups (COG) and gene ontology (GO) functional classification systems. Furthermore, the conserved common genes in these four cestode species were obtained and aligned by the KEGG database.This study provides an extensive transcriptome dataset obtained from the deep sequencing of T. pisiformis in a non-model whole genome. The identification of conserved genes may provide novel approaches for potential drug targets and vaccinations against cestode infections. Research can now accelerate into the functional genomics, immunity and gene expression profiles of cestode species."
https://openalex.org/W2026566443,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the severity of cognitive symptoms is better correlated with the levels of soluble amyloid-beta (Aβ) rather than with the deposition of fibrillar Aβ in amyloid plaques. In APP/PS1 mice, a murine model of AD, at 8 months of age the cerebellum is devoid of fibrillar Aβ, but dosage of soluble Aβ(1-42), the form which is more prone to aggregation, showed higher levels in this structure than in the forebrain. Aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of intrinsic membrane properties and of synaptic inputs in Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellum, where only soluble Aβ is present. PCs were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp in cerebellar slices from wild-type and APP/PS1 mice. In APP/PS1 PCs, evoked action potential discharge showed enhanced frequency adaptation and larger afterhyperpolarizations, indicating a reduction of the intrinsic membrane excitability. In the miniature GABAergic postsynaptic currents, the largest events were absent in APP/PS1 mice and the interspike intervals distribution was shifted to the left, but the mean amplitude and frequency were normal. The ryanodine-sensitive multivescicular release was not altered and the postsynaptic responsiveness to a GABA(A) agonist was intact. Climbing fiber postsynaptic currents were normal but their short-term plasticity was reduced in a time window of 100-800 ms. Parallel fiber postsynaptic currents and their short-term plasticity were normal. These results indicate that, in the cerebellar cortex, chronically elevated levels of soluble Aβ(1-42) are associated with alterations of the intrinsic excitability of PCs and with alterations of the release of GABA from interneurons and of glutamate from climbing fibers, while the release of glutamate from parallel fibers and all postsynaptic mechanisms are preserved. Thus, soluble Aβ(1-42) causes, in PCs, multiple functional alterations, including an impairment of intrinsic membrane properties and synapse-specific deficits, with differential consequences even in different subtypes of glutamatergic synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2025319678,"Most manipulation experiments simulating global change in tundra were short-term or did not measure plant growth directly. Here, we assessed the growth of three shrubs (Cassiope tetragona, Empetrum hermaphroditum and Betula nana) at a subarctic heath in Abisko (Northern Sweden) after 22 years of warming (passive greenhouses), fertilisation (nutrients addition) and shading (hessian fabric), and compare this to observations from the first decade of treatment. We assessed the growth rate of current-year leaves and apical stem (primary growth) and cambial growth (secondary growth), and integrated growth rates with morphological measurements and species coverage. Primary- and total growth of Cassiope and Empetrum were unaffected by manipulations, whereas growth was substantially reduced under fertilisation and shading (but not warming) for Betula. Overall, shrub height and length tended to increase under fertilisation and warming, whereas branching increased mostly in shaded Cassiope. Morphological changes were coupled to increased secondary growth under fertilisation. The species coverage showed a remarkable increase in graminoids in fertilised plots. Shrub response to fertilisation was positive in the short-term but changed over time, likely because of an increased competition with graminoids. More erected postures and large, canopies (requiring enhanced secondary growth for stem reinforcement) likely compensated for the increased light competition in Empetrum and Cassiope but did not avoid growth reduction in the shade intolerant Betula. The impact of warming and shading on shrub growth was more conservative. The lack of growth enhancement under warming suggests the absence of long-term acclimation for processes limiting biomass production. The lack of negative effects of shading on Cassiope was linked to morphological changes increasing the photosynthetic surface. Overall, tundra shrubs showed developmental plasticity over the longer term. However, such plasticity was associated clearly with growth rate trends only in fertilised plots."

We have shown that cortactin is regulated by reversible phosphorylation, but little is known regarding cortactin protein stability.

LPS induces cortactin serine phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation in mouse lung epithelia, an effect abrogated by ERK inhibition. Serine phosphorylation sites mutant, cortactinS405A/S418A, enhances its protein stability.

The E3 ligase subunit β-Trcp interacts with cortactin, and its overexpression reduced cortactin protein levels, an effect attenuated by ERK inhibition. Overexpression of β-Trcp was sufficient to reduce the protective effects of exogenous cortactin on epithelial cell barrier integrity, an effect not observed after expression of a cortactinK79R mutant.

https://openalex.org/W2086375424,"Although the basic scorpion K(+) channel toxins (KTxs) are well-known pharmacological tools and potential drug candidates, characterization the acidic KTxs still has the great significance for their potential selectivity towards different K(+) channel subtypes. Unfortunately, research on the acidic KTxs has been ignored for several years and progressed slowly.Here, we describe the identification of nine new acidic KTxs by cDNA cloning and bioinformatic analyses. Seven of these toxins belong to three new α-KTx subfamilies (α-KTx28, α-KTx29, and α-KTx30), and two are new members of the known κ-KTx2 subfamily. ImKTx104 containing three disulfide bridges, the first member of the α-KTx28 subfamily, has a low sequence homology with other known KTxs, and its NMR structure suggests ImKTx104 adopts a modified cystine-stabilized α-helix-loop-β-sheet (CS-α/β) fold motif that has no apparent α-helixs and β-sheets, but still stabilized by three disulfide bridges. These newly described acidic KTxs exhibit differential pharmacological effects on potassium channels. Acidic scorpion toxin ImKTx104 was the first peptide inhibitor found to affect KCNQ1 channel, which is insensitive to the basic KTxs and is strongly associated with human cardiac abnormalities. ImKTx104 selectively inhibited KCNQ1 channel with a K(d) of 11.69 µM, but was less effective against the basic KTxs-sensitive potassium channels. In addition to the ImKTx104 toxin, HeTx204 peptide, containing a cystine-stabilized α-helix-loop-helix (CS-α/α) fold scaffold motif, blocked both Kv1.3 and KCNQ1 channels. StKTx23 toxin, with a cystine-stabilized α-helix-loop-β-sheet (CS-α/β) fold motif, could inhibit Kv1.3 channel, but not the KCNQ1 channel.These findings characterize the structural and functional diversity of acidic KTxs, and could accelerate the development and clinical use of acidic KTxs as pharmacological tools and potential drugs."

Previous studies have indicated that factors other than Sox9 may promote chondrogenesis directly, but these factors have not been identified. Here, we test the hypothesis that Nkx3.2 promotes chondrogenesis directly by Sox9-independent mechanisms and indirectly by previously characterized Sox9-dependent mechanisms.C3H10T1/2 pluripotent mesenchymal cells were cultured with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) to induce endochondral ossification. Overexpression of wild-type Nkx3.2 (WT-Nkx3.2) upregulated glycosaminoglycan (GAG) production and expression of type II collagen α1 (Col2a1) mRNA, and these effects were evident before WT-Nkx3.2-mediated upregulation of Sox9. RNAi-mediated inhibition of Nkx3.2 abolished GAG production and expression of Col2a1 mRNA. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that WT-Nkx3.2 upregulated Col2a1 enhancer activity in a dose-dependent manner in C3H10T1/2 cells and also in N1511 chondrocytes. In addition, WT-Nkx3.2 partially restored downregulation of GAG production, Col2 protein expression, and Col2a1 mRNA expression induced by Sox9 RNAi. ChIP assays revealed that Nkx3.2 bound to the Col2a1 enhancer element.Nkx3.2 promoted primary chondrogenesis by two mechanisms: Direct and Sox9-independent upregulation of Col2a1 transcription and upregulation of Sox9 mRNA expression under positive feedback system."
https://openalex.org/W2125423965,"Eukaryotic F-actin is constructed from two protofilaments that gently wind around each other to form a helical polymer. Several bacterial actin-like proteins (Alps) are also known to form F-actin-like helical arrangements from two protofilaments, yet with varied helical geometries. Here, we report a unique filament architecture of Alp12 from Clostridium tetani that is constructed from four protofilaments. Through fitting of an Alp12 monomer homology model into the electron microscopy data, the filament was determined to be constructed from two antiparallel strands, each composed of two parallel protofilaments. These four protofilaments form an open helical cylinder separated by a wide cleft. The molecular interactions within single protofilaments are similar to F-actin, yet interactions between protofilaments differ from those in F-actin. The filament structure and assembly and disassembly kinetics suggest Alp12 to be a dynamically unstable force-generating motor involved in segregating the pE88 plasmid, which encodes the lethal tetanus toxin, and thus a potential target for drug design. Alp12 can be repeatedly cycled between states of polymerization and dissociation, making it a novel candidate for incorporation into fuel-propelled nanobiopolymer machines."

They host mycobacteria for which the sources of transferred genes remain unknown. Using BLASTp, we searched within the genomes of 15 mycobacteria for homologous genes with 34 amoeba-resistant bacteria and the free-living protozoa Dictyostelium discoideum. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis of these sequences revealed that eight mycobacterial open-reading frames (ORFs) were probably acquired via horizontal transfer from beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria and from Firmicutes, but the transfer histories could not be reliably established in details. One further ORF encoding a pyridine nucleotide disulfide oxidoreductase (pyr-redox) placed non-tuberculous mycobacteria in a clade with Legionella spp., Francisella spp., Coxiella burnetii, the ciliate Tetrahymena thermophila and D. discoideum with a high reliability. Co-culturing Mycobacterium avium and Legionella pneumophila with the amoeba Acanthamoeba polyphaga demonstrated that these two bacteria could live together in amoebae for five days, indicating the biological relevance of intra-amoebal transfer of the pyr-redox gene. In conclusion, the results of this study support the hypothesis that protists can serve as a source and a place for gene transfer in mycobacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2035229337,"It is accepted that sensory experience instructs the remodelling of neuronal circuits during postnatal development, after their specification has occurred. The story is less clear with regard to the role of experience during the initial formation of neuronal circuits, whether prenatal or postnatal, since this process is now supposed to be primarily influenced by genetic determinants and spontaneous neuronal firing. Here we evaluated this last issue by examining the effect that postnatal chronic exposure to cognate odorants has on the formation of I7 and M72 glomeruli, iterated olfactory circuits that are formed before and after birth, respectively. We took advantage of double knock-in mice whose I7 and M72 primary afferents express green fluorescent protein and β-galactosidase, correspondingly. Our results revealed that postnatal odorant chronic exposure led to the formation of permanent supernumerary I7 and M72 glomeruli in a dose and time dependent manner. Glomeruli in exposed mice were formed within the same regions of olfactory bulb and occupy small space volumes compared to the corresponding single circuits in non-exposed mice. We suggest that local reorganization of the primary afferents could participate in the process of formation of supernumerary glomeruli. Overall, our results support that sensory experience indeed instructs the permanent formation of specific glomeruli in the mouse olfactory bulb by means of constructivist processes."

Here, we describe its so far elusive mechanism of antibacterial action. Empedopeptin selectively interferes with late stages of cell wall biosynthesis in intact bacterial cells as demonstrated by inhibition of N-acetylglucosamine incorporation into polymeric cell wall and the accumulation of the ultimate soluble peptidoglycan precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramic acid-pentapeptide in the cytoplasm. Using membrane preparations and the complete cascade of purified, recombinant late stage peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes and their respective purified substrates, we show that empedopeptin forms complexes with undecaprenyl pyrophosphate containing peptidoglycan precursors. The primary physiological target of empedopeptin is undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-N-acetylmuramic acid(pentapeptide)-N-acetylglucosamine (lipid II), which is readily accessible at the outside of the cell and which forms a complex with the antibiotic in a 1:2 molar stoichiometry. Lipid II is bound in a region that involves at least the pyrophosphate group, the first sugar, and the proximal parts of stem peptide and undecaprenyl chain. Undecaprenyl pyrophosphate and also teichoic acid precursors are bound with lower affinity and constitute additional targets. Calcium ions are crucial for the antibacterial activity of empedopeptin as they promote stronger interaction with its targets and with negatively charged phospholipids in the membrane. Based on the high structural similarity of empedopeptin to the tripropeptins and plusbacins, we propose this mechanism of action for the whole compound class.

However, little is known about the biological activity, thus potential interferences with the assay results, of these probe molecules. Here we show that D-luciferin, one of the most widely used bioluminescence substrates, is a partial agonist for G protein-coupled receptor-35 (GPR35). Label-free phenotypic profiling using dynamic mass redistribution (DMR) assays showed that D-luciferin led to a DMR signal in native HT-29 cells, whose characteristics are similar to those induced by known GPR35 agonists including zaprinast and pamoic acid. DMR assays further showed that D-luciferin is a partial agonist competitive to several known GPR35 agonists and antagonists. D-luciferin was found to cause the phosphorylation of ERK that was suppressed by known GPR35 antagonists, and also result in β-arrestin translocation signal but with low efficacy. These results not only suggest that D-luciferin is a partial agonist of GPR35, but also will evoke careful interpretation of biological data obtained using molecular and in vivo imaging assays when these probe molecules are used."
https://openalex.org/W2088414447,"Concerted actions of estrogen and progesterone via their cognate receptors orchestrate changes in the uterine tissue, regulating implantation during early pregnancy. The uterine stromal cells undergo steroid-dependent differentiation into morphologically and functionally distinct decidual cells, which support embryonic growth and survival. The hormone-regulated pathways underlying this unique cellular transformation are not fully understood. Previous studies in the mouse revealed that, following embryo attachment, de novo synthesis of estrogen by the decidual cells is critical for stromal differentiation. In this study we report that Fos-related antigen 1 (FRA-1), a member of the Fos family of transcription factors, is a downstream target of regulation by intrauterine estrogen. FRA-1 expression was localized in the differentiating uterine stromal cells surrounding the implanted embryo. Attenuation of estrogen receptor α (Esr1) expression by siRNA mediated silencing in primary uterine stromal cells suppressed FRA-1 expression. Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated direct recruitment of ESR1 to an estrogen response element in the Fra-1 promoter. Down-regulation of Fra-1 expression during in vitro decidualization blocked stromal differentiation and resulted in a marked decrease in stromal cell migration. Interestingly, FRA-1 controls the expression of matrix metalloproteinases MMP9 and MMP13, which are critical modulators of stromal extracellular matrix remodeling. Collectively, these results suggest that FRA-1, induced in response to estrogen signaling via ESR1, is a key regulator of stromal differentiation and remodeling during early pregnancy."

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that the muscle adaptive response following mechanical overloading (ML) would be decreased in MDX dystrophic muscle lacking dystrophin. We found that the gains in muscle maximal force production and fatigue resistance in response to ML were both reduced in MDX mice as compared to healthy mice. MDX muscle also exhibited decreased cellular and molecular muscle remodeling (hypertrophy and promotion of slower/oxidative fiber type) in response to ML, and altered intracellular signalings involved in muscle growth and maintenance (mTOR, myostatin, follistatin, AMPKα1, REDD1, atrogin-1, Bnip3). Moreover, dystrophin rescue via exon skipping restored the adaptive response to ML. Therefore our results demonstrate that the adaptive response in response to ML is impaired in dystrophic MDX muscle, most likely because of the dystrophin crucial role."

This study describes a new plasmid pSPR2.1 that drives consistent high-level expression of tetracycline repressor in procyclic form trypanosomes. A complementary expression plasmid, p3227, was constructed. The major difference between this and current plasmids is the separation of the inducible transgene and selectable marker promoters by the plasmid backbone. The plasmid p3227 was able to support inducible expression in cell lines containing pSPR2.1 as well as the established Lister 427 29-13 cell line. p3666, a derivative of p3227, was made for inducible expression of stem loop RNAi constructs and was effective for knockdown of DRBD3, which had proved problematic using existing RNAi plasmids with head-to-head promoters. The plasmid system was also able to support inducible transgene expression and DRBD3 RNAi knockdown in bloodstream form cells expressing tetracycline repressor from an integrated copy of the plasmid pHD1313."

Logistic regression analysis was applied for statistical analyses. The results were validated in the replicative cohort and pooled by meta analysis using Fisher's and Mantel-Haenszel test. Furthermore, Benjamini - Hochberg false discovery rate test was used to correct for multiple comparisons. CYP19A1 rs10046 and CYP19A1 rs4646 polymorphisms were found to confer risk and protective effect, respectively. Out of four ESR1 polymorphisms, only rs2234693 variant allele was significantly associated in migraine with aura. No significant associations were observed for ESR2 polymorphisms. Significant haplotypes were identified for CYP19A1 and ESR1 polymorphisms. Gene- gene interactions of genotypes as well as haplotypes were observed for CYP19A1- ESR1 showing both risk and protective combinations.We strongly suggest CYP19A1 polymorphisms to be the major contributing factors in migraine susceptibility instead of genetic variants of estrogen receptors."
https://openalex.org/W1965206225,"Litomosoides sigmodontis is a cause of filarial infection in rodents. Once infective larvae overcome the skin barrier, they enter the lymphatic system and then settle in the pleural cavity, causing soft tissue infection. The outcome of infection depends on the parasite's modulatory ability and also on the immune response of the infected host, which is influenced by its genetic background. The goal of this study was to determine whether host factors such as the chemokine axis CXCL12/CXCR4, which notably participates in the control of immune surveillance, can influence the outcome of the infection. We therefore set up comparative analyses of subcutaneous infection by L. sigmodontis in two inbred mouse strains with different outcomes: one susceptible strain (BALB/c) and one resistant strain (C57BL/6). We showed that rapid parasite clearance was associated with a L. sigmodontis-specific CXCL12-dependent cell response in C57BL/6 mice. CXCL12 was produced mainly by pleural mesothelial cells during infection. Conversely, the delayed parasite clearance in BALB/c mice was neither associated with an increase in CXCL12 levels nor with cell influx into the pleural cavity. Remarkably, interfering with the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis in both strains of mice delayed filarial development, as evidenced by the postponement of the fourth molting process. Furthermore, the in vitro growth of stage 4 filariae was favored by the addition of low amounts of CXCL12. The CXCL12/CXCR4 axis thus appears to have a dual effect on the L. sigmodontis life cycle: by acting as a host-cell restriction factor for infection, and as a growth factor for worms."

However, research on iPSC still requires refining the criteria of the pluripotency stage of these cells and exploration of their equivalent functionality to human embryonic stem cells (ESC). We report here on the use of infrared microspectroscopy to follow the spectral modification of somatic cells during the reprogramming process. We show that induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) adopt a chemical composition leading to a spectral signature indistinguishable from that of embryonic stem cells (ESC) and entirely different from that of the original somatic cells. Similarly, this technique allows a distinction to be made between partially and fully reprogrammed cells. We conclude that infrared microspectroscopy signature is a novel methodology to evaluate induced pluripotency and can be added to the tests currently used for this purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2013544338,"Introduction Circulating cell-free DNA (cf-DNA) is a useful indicator of cell death, and it can also be used to predict outcomes in various clinical disorders. Several innate immune mechanisms are known to be involved in eliminating DNA and chromatin-related material as part of the inhibition of potentially harmful autoimmune responses. However, the exact molecular mechanism underlying the clearance of circulating cf-DNA is currently unclear. Methods To examine the mechanisms controlling serum levels of cf-DNA, we carried out a genome-wide association analysis (GWA) in a cohort of young adults (aged 24–39 years; n = 1841; 1018 women and 823 men) participating in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Genotyping was performed with a custom-built Illumina Human 670 k BeadChip. The Quant-iTTM high sensitivity DNA assay was used to measure cf-DNA directly from serum. Results The results revealed that 110 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with serum cf-DNA with genome-wide significance (p<5×10−8). All of these significant SNPs were localised to chromosome 2q37, near the UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1 (UGT1) family locus, and the most significant SNPs localised within the UGT1 polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) gene region. Conclusion The UGT1A1 enzyme catalyses the detoxification of several drugs and the turnover of many xenobiotic and endogenous compounds by glucuronidating its substrates. These data indicate that UGT1A1-associated processes are also involved in the regulation of serum cf-DNA concentrations."

Studies investigating the step at which ZAP inhibits the replication of MMLV have shown that the formation and nuclear entry of viral DNA are not affected. However, the level of viral mRNA in the cytoplasm is dramatically reduced. Further studies have shown that ZAP binds directly to target viral mRNA (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4352-4357Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). ZAP also recruits the decapping complex Dcp1-Dcp2 through p72 to remove the cap structure of the target viral mRNA to initiate the degradation of viral mRNA from the 5′-end (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been suggested that ZAP represses the translation of the target mRNA (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which ZAP represses target mRNA translation are not clear yet. Full-length rat ZAP is composed of 776 amino acids (1Gao G. Guo X. Goff S.P. Inhibition of retroviral RNA production by ZAP, a CCCH-type zinc-finger protein.Science. 2002; 297: 1703-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) and contains four CCCH-type zinc-finger motifs in the N-terminal domain. The 254-amino acid N-terminal domain of ZAP displays considerable antiviral activity when fused with the Zeocin resistance gene product (NZAP-Zeo) (1Gao G. Guo X. Goff S.P. Inhibition of retroviral RNA production by ZAP, a CCCH-type zinc-finger protein.Science. 2002; 297: 1703-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The function of the C-terminal domain of ZAP remains largely elusive. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was initially identified in rabbit skeletal muscle as a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates glycogen synthase (9Embi N. Rylatt D.B. Cohen P. Glycogen synthase kinase 3 from rabbit skeletal muscle. Separation from cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and phosphorylase kinase.Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 519-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). GSK3 was later shown to have two closely related isoforms (10Woodgett J.R. Molecular cloning and expression of glycogen synthase kinase 3/factor A.EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2431-2438Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar), GSK3α and GSK3β. For GSK3β to phosphorylate a substrate, a serine or threonine residue of the substrate usually needs to be phosphorylated beforehand. This residue, termed the priming site, is located four or five amino acids C-terminal to the first GSK3β target residue (11Fiol C.J. Mahrenholz A.M. Wang Y. Roeske R.W. Roach P.J.

In this study, we demonstrate that GSK3β phosphorylates rat ZAP and modulates its antiviral activity. pcDNA4TO/Myc-ZAP, which expresses Myc-tagged full-length rat ZAP, has been described previously (13Guo X. Ma J. Sun J. Gao G. The zinc-finger antiviral protein recruits the RNA-processing exosome to degrade the target mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). pcDNA4TO/Myc-NZAP332 and pcDNA4TO/Myc-NZAP295 express Myc-tagged NZAP332 (N-terminal amino acids 1–332) and NZAP295 (amino acids 1–295), respectively. The plasmids were generated by replacing the BamHI-NotI fragment of pcDNA4TO/Myc-ZAP with PCR fragments generated using forward primer NZAP-FP (5′-ATCGGATCCGCCACCATGGCAGATCCCGGGGTATG-3′) and reverse primers NZAP332-RP (5′-CTCGAGCGGCCGCCATTCC-3′) and NZAP295-RP (5′-TCGAGCGGCCGCCCTTGAACTTCTGGGT-3′). To generate NZAP295 mutants, pcDNA4TO/Myc-NZAP295 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis by overlapping PCR as described previously (14Wang X. Lv F. Gao G. Mutagenesis analysis of the zinc-finger antiviral protein.Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 19Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). pGEX-NZAP295 expresses NZAP295 fused with GST at the N terminus (GST-NZAP295). The coding sequence of NZAP295 was PCR-amplified using primers NZAP-FP and NZAP295-RP and cloned into pGEX-5X-3 (GE Healthcare). pGEX-NZAP295(S1–8A), which expresses GST-NZAP295(S1–8A) (where S1–8A represents the substitution of eight serine residues with alanines), was constructed in a similar manner. pMMLV-luc and pRL-TK have been described previously (15Guo X. Carroll J.W. Macdonald M.R. Goff S.P. Gao G. The zinc-finger antiviral protein directly binds to specific viral mRNAs through the CCCH zinc-finger motifs.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12781-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). GSK3β was amplified from a human embryonic kidney cDNA library using forward primer GSK3β-FP (5′-TGAGAATTCTCAGGGCGGCCCAGAACCACCT-3′) bearing an EcoRI site and reverse primer GSK3β-RP (5′-CGGCTCGAGTCAGGTGGAGTTGGAAGCTGAT-3′) bearing an XhoI site and cloned into expression vector pCMV-HA-FLAG (13Guo X. Ma J. Sun J. Gao G. The zinc-finger antiviral protein recruits the RNA-processing exosome to degrade the target mRNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 151-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) using these two sites. To generate a GSK3β-expressing construct that cannot be down-regulated by Gi-5 shRNA, silent mutations were introduced into pCMV-HA-FLAG-GSK3β by overlapping PCR (8Chen G. Guo X. Lv F. Xu Y.

The sequences of the primers used were as follows: GSK3βi5M-FP, 5′-AAGAACCGTGAGTTGCAAATTATGAGAAAG-3′; and GSK3βi5M-RP, 5′-CTTTCTCATAATTTGCAACTCACGGTTCTT-3′ (with the modified nucleotides underlined). To generate plasmids expressing shRNAs directed against GSK3β, oligonucleotides were synthesized, annealed, and cloned into pSUPER plasmids (Oligoengine) as described previously (8Chen G. Guo X.

All cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). 293TRex and 293TRex-ZAP cell lines have been described previously (15Guo X. Carroll J.W. Macdonald M.R. Goff S.P. Gao G. The zinc-finger antiviral protein directly binds to specific viral mRNAs through the CCCH zinc-finger motifs.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12781-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lentiviral vectors NL4–3-luc and HR′-luc have been described previously (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To analyze the effect of SB216763 treatment on the antiviral activity of ZAP, 293TRex-ZAP cells were infected with NL4–3-luc or HR′-luc. At 5 h post-infection, tetracycline was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml to induce ZAP expression, and SB216763 was added to a final concentration of 10 μm to inhibit GSK3b. At 53 h post-infection, the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured. Fold inhibition was calculated as luciferase activity in cells without tetracycline treatment divided by that in cells treated with tetracycline. Anti-Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-FLAG (Sigma), and anti-β-actin (Sigma) monoclonal antibodies were obtained commercially. To detect the phosphorylation of ZAP Ser-274 (referred to as S5 in this study), a peptide (CGGPPSPD) in which the serine residue was phosphorylated was synthesized (SciLight Biotechnology), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and used to immunize rabbits to generate a polyclonal antibody. The antibody was affinity-purified with the peptide conjugated to BSA. GST-NZAP295 or GST-NZAP295(S1–8A) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and partially purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein was incubated with recombinant GSK3β, CDK1, or CK2 (New England Biolabs) in the presence of 5 μm unlabeled ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C. Reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. 293TRex-ZAP cells were infected with NL4–3-luc. At 5 h post-infection, tetracycline was added to induce ZAP expression, and SB216763 was added to inhibit GSK3β. At 53 h post-infection, cells were collected. Ten percent of the cells were lysed to measure luciferase activity. The rest of the cells were used to extract cytoplasmic mRNA, followed by reverse transcription. nef-luc mRNA levels were measured by TaqMan real-time PCR as described previously (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). When the 332-amino acid N-terminal domain of ZAP (NZAP332) expressed in HEK293 cells was analyzed by Western blotting, multiple bands were detected (Fig. 1A). We speculated that their appearance might result from phosphorylation of the protein. To test this idea, NZAP332 was immunoprecipitated and treated with alkaline phosphatase, followed by Western blot analysis. Alkaline phosphatase treatment abolished the mobility shift of NZAP332 (Fig. 1A), indicating that NZAP332 is phosphorylated and that the phosphorylation leads to a mobility shift. There are eight serine residues in ZAP in the region of amino acids 255–295 (numbered 1–8 from the N terminus in this report (Fig. 1B)), which are possible phosphorylation sites. There are also some serine residues in the region of amino acids 296–332. We focused on the serine residues in the region of amino acids 255–295 and thus constructed NZAP295, which covers amino acids 1–295. Substitutions of the eight serine residues with alanines (S1–8A) abolished the mobility shift (Fig. 1B), whereas substitution of the fourth through eighth serines (S4–8A) removed most but not all of the mobility shift, and mutation of only the seventh and eighth serines (S7–8A) changed the mobility shift only modestly (Fig. 1B). These results imply that at least some of these serine residues are phosphorylated. Sequence analysis of amino acids 1–295 of rat ZAP using NetPhosK software (16Blom N. Gammeltoft S. Brunak S. Sequence and structure-based prediction of eukaryotic protein phosphorylation sites.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1351-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar) predicted that ZAP might be a substrate of GSK3β, as it contains several potential GSK3β phosphorylation motifs, (S/T)XXX(S/T). To test this idea, bacterially expressed GST-NZAP295 or GST-NZAP295(S1–8A) was incubated with recombinant GSK3β and [γ-32P]ATP in vitro. Serine/threonine kinases CDK1 and CK2 were used as specificity controls. Indeed, GSK3β phosphorylated the wild-type protein but not the GST-NZAP295(S1–8A) mutant (Fig. 2A). In contrast, CDK1 failed to phosphorylate GST-NZAP295, and phosphorylation of the protein by CK2 was very modest (Fig. 2A). Detection of comparable autophosphorylation of the kinases indicates that comparable amounts of active enzymes existed in the reactions (Fig. 2A). Phosphorylation of GST-NZAP295 by GSK3β increased with prolonged reaction times (Fig. 2B). In contrast, phosphorylation of GST-NZAP295(S1–8A) was not detected (Fig. 2B). These results suggest that GSK3β phosphorylates at least some of the eight serine residues in vitro. To test whether GSK3β phosphorylates ZAP in vivo, we treated cells with SB216763, a small-molecule compound that specifically inhibits the kinase activity of GSK3β (17Coghlan M.P. Culbert A.A. Cross D.A. Corcoran S.L. Yates J.W. Pearce N.J. Rausch O.L. Murphy G.J. Carter P.S. Roxbee Cox L. Mills D. Brown M.J. Haigh D. Ward R.W. Smith D.G. Murray K.J. Reith A.D. Holder J.C. Selective small-molecule inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3 modulate glycogen metabolism and gene transcription.Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 793-803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar). As expected, treatment of cells with SB216763 resulted in a dramatic reduction of the phosphorylation of Myc-tagged NZAP332 (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1 and 3). Notably, when the lysate of SB216763-treated cells was incubated with alkaline phosphatase, NZAP332 phosphorylation was further reduced (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that NZAP332 is also phosphorylated by other kinase(s). In addition, when GSK3β was overexpressed, bands of less phosphorylated NZAP332 were absent (Fig. 2D). To further demonstrate that ZAP is phosphorylated by GSK3β, shRNAs directed against GSK3β (Gi-3 and Gi-5) were constructed. Consistently, down-regulation of endogenous GSK3β by the shRNAs led to reduction of NZAP295 and NZAP332 phosphorylation (Fig. 2, E and F). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that GSK3β phosphorylates ZAP in vivo. To identify the serine residues of NZAP295 phosphorylated by GSK3β, we individually substituted the alanines of NZAP295(S1–8A) with serines and analyzed the phosphorylation of these mutants by mobility shift assays. Only substitution of the fifth and seventh alanines with serine caused marked mobility shifts (Fig. 3A). When S5 of NZAP295 was replaced with alanine, most of the phosphorylated bands disappeared (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 3). In comparison, substitution of S7 of NZAP295 with alanine had little effect on the phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 5). When cells were treated with SB216763, phosphorylation of NZAP295(S7A) was dramatically reduced (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 1 and 2 and lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, SB216763 had no effect on NZAP295(S5A) (Fig. 3B, compare lanes 3 and 4). These results suggest that S5 is critical for GSK3β to phosphorylate ZAP and could be either the priming site or a phosphorylation site of GSK3β. To detect phosphorylation of S5, we developed a polyclonal antibody against a peptide containing phosphorylated S5 (see “Experimental Procedures”). The antibody (anti-P-S5) specifically detected ZAP with phosphorylated S5 but not the S5A mutant (Fig. 3C, upper panel). Fewer bands were detected with this antibody than with the anti-Myc antibody, which detects all forms of the protein (Fig. 3C, compare upper and middle panels), suggesting that some of the protein is not phosphorylated at S5. To further map the GSK3β phosphorylation sites of ZAP, we individually substituted the serines of NZAP295 with alanine and analyzed their phosphorylation status. The S5A mutation removed most of the phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 3C). In comparison, substitution of S1–S4 had less effect, with substitution of the residue at the N terminus having less effect than substitution of the residue at the C terminus (Fig. 3C). This pattern suggests that S5 is the priming site and that GSK3β sequentially phosphorylates S4 to S1. To substantiate this notion, we substituted the alanines of NZAP295(S1–8A) with serine one by one. When the fifth alanine was replaced with serine (NZAP295(S1–8A)S5), a single band was detected by anti-P-S5 antibody (Fig. 3D, upper panel, lane 5). When the fifth and fourth alanines were replaced with serines (NZAP295(S1–8A)S4-S5), the mobility of the protein was slower than that of NZAP295(S1–8A)S5 (Fig. 3D, upper panel, compare lanes 4 and 5), suggesting that both S4 and S5 are phosphorylated. Replacement of the third, second, and first alanines with serine sequentially increased the phosphorylation of the protein (Fig. 3D), indicating that these residues are phosphorylated. To test whether these residues are phosphorylated by GSK3β, cells expressing the Ser-to-Ala single mutants were treated with SB216763. The inhibitor had no effect on the phosphorylation of NZAP295(S4A) (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 9 and 10) but decreased the phosphorylation of NZAP295(S3A) (compare lanes 7 and 8). These results are consistent with the notion that S4 is the first residue phosphorylated by GSK3β and that its phosphorylation is required for the phosphorylation of S3 by GSK3β. Substitution of S2 with alanine reduced phosphorylation (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 1 and 5), and SB216763 treatment also reduced phosphorylation (compare lanes 5 and 6). A similar phenomenon was also observed with S1 (Fig. 3E, compare lanes 1 and 3 and lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these results show that GSK3β sequentially phosphorylates S4 to S1, with S5 as the priming site. To investigate the effect of GSK3β phosphorylation on ZAP function, we first compared the antiviral activity of ZAP and ZAP(S1–8A) against MMLV-luc (15Guo X. Carroll J.W. Macdonald M.R. Goff S.P. Gao G. The zinc-finger antiviral protein directly binds to specific viral mRNAs through the CCCH zinc-finger motifs.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12781-12787Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Compared with wild-type ZAP, the mutant displayed reduced antiviral activity (Fig. 4A), suggesting that phosphorylation is required for optimal activity of ZAP. Furthermore, overexpression of GSK3β in 293TRex-ZAP cells, which express ZAP upon tetracycline treatment, increased ZAP activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4B). To test whether endogenous GSK3β modulates ZAP activity, endogenous GSK3β was down-regulated by RNAi, and the effect on the antiviral activity of ZAP against MMLV-luc was evaluated. To confirm the specificity of the shRNA (Gi-5) to target GSK3β, a GSK3β-expressing plasmid (GSK3βM) that cannot be targeted by Gi-5 was constructed (Fig. 4C). Down-regulation of GSK3β reduced the antiviral activity of ZAP, and the reduction by Gi-5 was rescued by coexpression of GSK3βM (Fig. 4D, left panel). In contrast, down-regulation of GSK3β had little effect of the antiviral activity of ZAP(S1–8A) (Fig. 4D, right panel). To evaluate the effect of GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation on the antiviral activity of ZAP against HIV-1 pseudovirus, ZAP-expressing cells were treated with SB216763 to inhibit GSK3β. The cells were challenged with the HIV-1 vector NL4–3-luc, which is inhibited by ZAP (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), or with HR′-luc, which is not sensitive to ZAP (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). SB216763 treatment did not affect the expression of ZAP (Fig. 5D) but dramatically reduced the activity of ZAP against NL4–3-luc (Fig. 5A). In contrast, SB216763 treatment did not affect the expression of HR′-luc (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, SB216763 treatment had little effect on the antiviral activity of NZAP-Zeo (Fig. 5B) and ZAP(S1–8A) (Fig. 5C), which do not contain the GSK3β phosphorylation sites. It is worth mentioning that the -fold inhibition of ZAP(S1–8A) against NL4–3-luc was higher than that of wild-type ZAP. Because the antiviral activity of ZAP is dependent on its expression level (3Müller S. Möller P. Bick M.J. Wurr S. Becker S. Günther S. Kümmerer B.M. Inhibition of filovirus replication by the zinc-finger antiviral protein.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2391-2400Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), and fold inhibition is calculated as luciferase activity in the mock-treated cells divided by that in the tetracycline-treated cells, fold inhibition not only reflects the intrinsic antiviral activity but also the relative expression levels of ZAP. The higher fold inhibition of ZAP(S1–8A) could be just a clonal effect. SB216763 treatment of 293TRex-ZAP cells did not affect the expression of ZAP (Fig. 5D). Hence, the effect of SB216763 on the fold inhibition of a particular protein should just reflect its effect on the intrinsic antiviral activity. It has been suggested that ZAP can both repress the translation and promote the degradation of its target mRNA (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). To test which aspects of the antiviral activity of ZAP are affected by GSK3β phosphorylation, we analyzed whether treatment of 293TRex-ZAP cells with SB216763 affects ZAP-mediated reduction in the reporter mRNA level. The data show that SB216763 treatment reduced ZAP activity to inhibit reporter protein expression but had little effect on ZAP activity to promote reporter mRNA degradation (Fig. 5E). These results suggest that phosphorylation of ZAP by GSK3β affects its ability to repress the translation of target mRNA but not its ability to promote target mRNA degradation. Collectively, these results indicate that phosphorylation by GSK3β is required for the optimal functioning of ZAP. ZAP inhibits the replication of certain viruses by binding to specific viral mRNAs and recruiting cellular RNA degradation machinery to degrade target RNA. In addition, it has been suggested that ZAP represses the translation of target viral mRNAs (2Zhu Y. Chen G. Lv F. Wang X. Ji X. Xu Y. Sun J. Wu L. Zheng Y.T. Gao G. Zinc-finger antiviral protein inhibits HIV-1 infection by selectively targeting multiply spliced viral mRNAs for degradation.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2011; 108: 15834-15839Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that GSK3β phosphorylates some of the serine residues of ZAP and that phosphorylation by GSK3β enhances the antiviral activity of ZAP. Furthermore, our results suggest that phosphorylation of ZAP by GSK3β affects its ability to repress target mRNA translation without affecting its ability to promote target mRNA degradation (Fig. 5E). This notion is supported by our preliminary results that mutation of S1–S8 or SB216763 treatment of ZAP reduced its interaction with a cellular factor involved in translational repression but did not affect its interaction with components of the mRNA degradation machinery, such as exosome component Rrp46 and PARN. 4L. Sun and G. Gao, unpublished data. Further investigation is needed to detail the mechanisms by which phosphorylation of ZAP by GSK3β modulates its activity. Ser-270, Ser-266, Ser-262, and Ser-257 (S1–S4 in this work) were mapped as the phosphorylation sites of GSK3β, with Ser-274 (S5) as the priming site. Single mutation of Ser-274 led to dramatic changes in NZAP phosphorylation. It remains to be determined which kinase phosphorylates Ser-274. Bacterially expressed recombinant ZAP, which presumably lacks the phosphorylated priming site, was phosphorylated by GSK3β in in vitro kinase assays. One possible explanation is that GSK3β can execute phosphorylation without phosphorylation of the priming site, but when the priming site is phosphorylated, GSK3β works more efficiently. Similar observations have also been reported for the phosphorylation of tau and β-catenin by GSK3β (18Ishiguro K. Omori A. Takamatsu M. Sato K. Arioka M. Uchida T. Imahori K.

https://openalex.org/W2012635509,"As the central effector of visual transduction, the regulation of photoreceptor phosphodiesterase (PDE6) is controlled by both allosteric mechanisms and extrinsic binding partners. However, the conformational changes and interactions of PDE6 with known interacting proteins are poorly understood. Using a fluorescence detection system for the analytical ultracentrifuge, we examined allosteric changes in PDE6 structure and protein-protein interactions with its inhibitory γ-subunit, the prenyl-binding protein (PrBP/δ), and activated transducin. In solution, the PDE6 catalytic dimer (Pαβ) exhibits a more asymmetric shape (axial ratio of 6.6) than reported previously. The inhibitory Pγ subunit behaves as an intrinsically disordered protein in solution but binds with high affinity to the catalytic dimer to reconstitute the holoenzyme without a detectable change in shape. Whereas the closely related PDE5 homodimer undergoes a significant change in its sedimentation properties upon cGMP binding to its regulatory cGMP binding site, no such change was detected upon ligand binding to the PDE6 catalytic dimer. However, when Pαβ was reconstituted with Pγ truncation mutants lacking the C-terminal inhibitory region, cGMP-dependent allosteric changes were observed. PrBP/δ bound to the PDE6 holoenzyme with high affinity (KD = 6.2 nm) and induced elongation of the protein complex. Binding of activated transducin to PDE6 holoenzyme resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in the sedimentation coefficient, reflecting a dynamic equilibrium between transducin and PDE6. We conclude that allosteric regulation of PDE6 is more complex than for PDE5 and is dependent on interactions of regions of Pγ with the catalytic dimer.

https://openalex.org/W2155839904,"The conserved TPLH tetrapeptide motif of ankyrin repeats (ARs) plays an important role in stabilizing AR proteins, and histidine (TPLH)-to-arginine (TPLR) mutations in this motif have been associated with a hereditary human anemia, spherocytosis. Here, we used a combination of atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to examine the mechanical effects of His → Arg substitutions in TPLH motifs in a model AR protein, NI6C. Our molecular dynamics results show that the mutant protein is less mechanically stable than the WT protein. Our atomic force microscopy results indicate that the mechanical energy input necessary to fully unfold the mutant protein is only half of that necessary to unfold the WT protein (53 versus 106 kcal/mol). In addition, the ability of the mutant to generate refolding forces is also reduced. Moreover, the mutant protein subjected to cyclic stretch-relax measurements displays mechanical fatigue, which is absent in the WT protein. Taken together, these results indicate that the His → Arg substitutions in TPLH motifs compromise mechanical properties of ARs and suggest that the origin of hereditary spherocytosis may be related to mechanical failure of ARs."
https://openalex.org/W2077499647,"Cholestasis is frequently related to endotoxemia and inflammatory response. Our previous investigation revealed a significant increase in plasma endotoxin and CD14 levels during biliary atresia. We therefore propose that lipopolysacharides (LPS) may stimulate CD14 production in liver cells and promote the removal of endotoxins. The aims of this study are to test the hypothesis that CD14 is upregulated by LPS and investigate the pathophysiological role of CD14 production during cholestasis. Using Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and promoter activity assay, we demonstrated that LPS was associated with a significant increase in CD14 and MD2 protein and mRNA expression and CD14 promoter activity in C9 rat hepatocytes but not in the HSC-T6 hepatic stellate cell line in vitro. To correlate CD14 expression and endotoxin sensitivity, in vivo biliary LPS administration was performed on rats two weeks after they were subjected to bile duct ligation (BDL) or a sham operation. CD14 expression and endotoxin levels were found to significantly increase after LPS administration in BDL rats. These returned to basal levels after 24 h. In contrast, although endotoxin levels were increased in sham-operated rats given LPS, no increase in CD14 expression was observed. However, mortality within 24 h was more frequent in the BDL animals than in the sham-operated group. In conclusion, cholestasis and LPS stimulation were here found to upregulate hepatic CD14 expression, which may have led to increased endotoxin sensitivity and host proinflammatory reactions, causing organ failure and death in BDL rats."
https://openalex.org/W1992373547,"Signaling via the intracellular second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP) has long been implicated in the repression of megakaryocytic differentiation. However, the mechanisms by which cAMP signaling impairs megakaryopoiesis have never been elucidated. In a human CD34(+) cell culture model, we show that the adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin inhibits megakaryocytic differentiation in a protein kinase A-dependent manner. Using this system to screen for downstream effectors, we identified the transcription factor E2A as a key target in a novel repressive signaling pathway. Specifically, forskolin acting through protein kinase A-induced E2A down-regulation and enforced expression of E2A overrode the inhibitory effects of forskolin on megakaryopoiesis. The dependence of megakaryopoiesis on critical thresholds of E2A expression was confirmed in vivo in haploinsufficient mice and ex vivo using shRNA knockdown in human progenitors. Using a variety of approaches, we further identified p21 (encoded by CDKN1A) as a functionally important megakaryopoietic regulator residing downstream of E2A. These results thus implicate the E2A-CDKN1A transcriptional axis in the control of megakaryopoiesis and reveal the lineage-selective inhibition of this axis as a likely mechanistic basis for the inhibitory effects of cAMP signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2048842540,"The Sac10b protein family is regarded as a family of DNA-binding proteins that is highly conserved and widely distributed within the archaea. Sac10b family members are typically small basic dimeric proteins that bind to DNA with cooperativity and no sequence specificity and are capable of constraining DNA negative supercoils, protecting DNA from Dnase I digestion, and do not compact DNA obviously. However, a detailed understanding of the structural basis of the interaction of Sac10b family proteins with DNA is still lacking. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Mth10b, an atypical member of the Sac10b family from Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum ΔH, at 2.2 Å. Unlike typical Sac10b family proteins, Mth10b is an acidic protein and binds to neither DNA nor RNA. The overall structure of Mth10b displays high similarity to its homologs, but three pairs of conserved positively charged residues located at the presumed DNA-binding surface are substituted by non-charged residues in Mth10b. Through amino acids interchanges, the DNA-binding ability of Mth10b was restored successfully, whereas the DNA-binding ability of Sso10b, a typical Sac10b family member, was weakened greatly. Based on these results, we propose a model describing the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions of typical Sac10b family proteins with DNA that explains all the characteristics of the interactions between typical Sac10b family members and DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1995108911,"The immunogenicity and the efficacy of a beta-propiolactone-inactivated caprine herpesvirus 1 (CpHV-1) vaccine adjuvanted with MF59™ were tested in goats. Following two subcutaneous immunizations, goats developed high titers of CpHV-1-specific serum and vaginal IgG and high serum virus neutralization (VN) titers. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated in vitro with inactivated CpHV-1 produced high levels of soluble IFN-gamma and exhibited high frequencies of IFN-gamma producing cells while soluble IL-4 was undetectable. On the other hand, control goats receiving the inactivated CpHV-1 vaccine without adjuvant produced only low serum antibody responses. A vaginal challenge with virulent CpHV-1 was performed in all vaccinated goats and in naïve goats to assess the efficacy of the two vaccines. Vaginal disease was not detected in goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59™ and these animals had undetectable levels of infectious challenge virus in their vaginal washes. Goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 in the absence of adjuvant exhibited a less severe disease when compared to naïve goats but shed titers of challenge virus that were similar to those of naïve goats. Detection and quantitation of latent CpHV-1 DNA in sacral ganglia in challenged goats revealed that the inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59™ vaccine was able to significantly reduce the latent viral load when compared either to the naïve goats or to the goats vaccinated with inactivated CpHV-1 in the absence of adjuvant. Thus, a vaccine composed of inactivated CpHV-1 plus MF59™ as adjuvant was strongly immunogenic and induced effective immunity against vaginal CpHV-1 infection in goats."
