https://openalex.org/W1986693856,"A SPECIES of Cephalosporium isolated in Sardinia was reported, in 1948, to produce an antibiotic which inhibited the growth of a number of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria1. This antibiotic, which was only obtained in a crude form, was not characterized chemically. In 1949 certain members of the genus Cephalosporium, including one that was believed to constitute a new species, were reported in the United States to produce a water-soluble antibiotic called synnematin2. In 1951 further studies were reported on the new species and its antibiotic, synnematin3. These studies included the determination of chemical and biological properties of the antibiotic. The new species was later named Cephalosporium salmosynnematum
4. In 1951 work in England revealed that the Cephalosporium from Sardinia produced a family of antibiotics, cephalosporin P 1–5 inclusive, which could be extracted into common organic solvents, and a water-soluble antibiotic with quite different properties. The latter was named cephalosporin N
5. Further work disclosed the presence of another antibiotic named cephalosporin C which is closely related to cephalosporin N

The streptomycete producing this pigment is not identical with any of the following species stated to produce green pigments: S. verne, S. viridans, S. virgatus, S. flavovirens, S. viridis, S. viridochromogenes. Its morphological and cultural characteristics indicate that it may be a new species."

https://openalex.org/W1970588933,"THE clear blue oceanic water in the tropics and subtropics, where the standing crops both of phyto-plankton and zooplankton are extremely low—the reason why the water is so clear and blue—should on this account show very low organic productivity by the plankton algae. Measurements with the carbon-14 method have shown this to be true1."

https://openalex.org/W2084802367,"IN the course of an investigation of the vitamin contents of different organs of the tunny (Thunnus thynnus) caught off the coast of Norway, very high values were found for pantothenic acid in the ovaries, up to 245 µgm. per gm. of fresh tissue1. The tunny spawns in the Mediterranean and nearby waters in June and early July, whereupon shoals of the fish move in search for food and arrive off the coast of Norway in July–October. At this time the ovaries are small and in the first stages of a new reproductive cycle. Earlier observations in ovaries (hard roes) from different species of fish had indicated differences in the pantothenic acid content in relation to their degree of ‘ripening’, the values being lowest at the time of spawning. The findings in the ovaries from the tunny indicated a relation between the pantothenic acid in the ovaries and the sexual cycle of the fish. As cod (Gadus morrhua) of all sizes are brought alive to the fish market in Bergen all the year round, it was chosen as a suitable species for the further investigations."

https://openalex.org/W2057497295,"THE activity of several compounds, structurally unrelated to p-aminobenzoic acid, in reversing growth inhibition of Escherichia coli by sulphonamides, was explained by Shive and Roberts1 as due to their being products of enzymes associated with p-amino-benzoic acid. Using increasing concentrations of sulphanilamide, these authors showed that it inhibits sequentially the synthesis of methionine and xanthine by the organism. Winkler and de Haan2 extended this study to higher concentrations of the inhibitor, and reported further involvement of serine and thymine (the latter, interchangeably with pteroyl glutamic acid) in that order in the p-aminobenzoic acid action; further addition of valine was stimulatory to growth."

https://openalex.org/W2036739753,"THERE is some evidence that 5-hydroxytryptamine may be concerned in haemostasis (reviewed by Page1); but it is difficult to test directly the haemostatic effect of the drug in normal persons, because, if it has such a role, it is presumably already available in optimal concentration. An attempt was therefore made to weaken the normal haemostatic system in man by treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide, which Gaddum, Hameed, Hathway and Stephens2 have found to be a potent inhibitor of 5-hydroxytryptamine on the isolated rat uterus. Because of its effect on the personality, the drug could not be administered systemically. The effect of the drug was therefore investigated by measuring the ‘capillary resistance’ in small areas of skin which had been infiltrated by iontophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W1972946650,"VITAMIN A1 occurs predominantly in the liver oils of marine fish, whereas vitamin A2 is found largely in freshwater fish liver oils. The mode of action of vitamins A1 and A2 is not certain; but their role in vision, giving rise to the pigments rhodopsin and porphyropsin respectively, in the retina is now well established1. Due to paucity of high-potency freshwater fish liver oils as well as their labile nature, vitamin A2 has not yet been obtained in a crystalline form. The spectroscopic properties2,3 and the biological activity4 of vitamin A2, which is approximately 40 per cent of that of vitamin A1, have been determined with the purest preparation obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2156518052,"Trichomonas hominis, like most other intestinal parasites1, is usually cultured in vitro in a Dobell–Laidlaw biphasic medium (horse serum, rice starch and Ringer's solution to which is added 15 per cent liquid horse serum)2. Growth of T. hominis in that medium occurs only when associated with bacteria. At 25° C. the equilibrium between bacteria and protozoa is optimum, and after forty days of incubation, Trichomonas are still numerous and lively. In such conditions, the maximum protozoal concentration attained is about 200,000 cells/c.c."
https://openalex.org/W1991768283,"IN general, the calculation of maximum likelihood1,2 estimates of gene frequencies requires the preliminary calculation of trial values, followed by the computation of corrections to the trial values, by a method which is essentially Newton's method of successive approximations for getting a root of an equation. In many Pacific populations (Gilbertese, Fijians, etc.), only four or five Rh types CDe/C (R
1
R
1), CDe/c (R
1
r), CDE/c (R
1
R
2), cDE (R
2), and occasionally a little cDe (R
0) are present3, and the composition of the population can be explained by assuming that only three genes, R
1, R
2, and R
0, are present. For such cases the maximum likelihood equations can be solved explicitly, and the best estimates of the gene frequencies obtained without any process of successive approximations. If we designate the frequencies of the five phenotypes, in the order just mentioned, as H K P T and Q, the solution of the maximum likelihood equations gives the following formulae:"

https://openalex.org/W1979864814,"INJECTIONS of Indian ink, causing so-called ‘blockade’ of the reticulo-endothelial system, have, in the past, been classified with splenectomy and cortisone as agents calculated to lower the resistance of host animals to plasmodial infections. For example, Trager1, working with chickens infected with Plasmodium lophurae, found that indian ink usually caused the development of heavy parasitæmias in the birds receiving it."

https://openalex.org/W1995350740,"Dasgupta, Ray, Roy and Werner1, Mukherjee2 and the present authors3 have made certain observations on the anti-adrenaline effect of extracts of Rauwolfia serpentina, but their effects on the action of acetyl-choline or of histamine have not yet been reported. Experiments have been carried out on isolated strips of guinea pig ileum in Dale's bath, containing oxygenated Ringer–Locke's solution at 35° C., and the modifications caused by varying concentrations (10−6 to 10−4 gm./ml.) of extracts of Rauwolfia serpentina (total alkaloids extracted in 2 per cent hydrochloric acid) on the action of acetylcholine (10−8 gm./ml.) or of histamine (10−8 to 10−7 gm./ml.) were studied. The extracts produced, by themselves, a definite but slight and transient contraction of the intestine. Dasgupta et al. 1 did not, however, find any stimulating effect on intestine in situ, whereas Chopra, Gupta and Mukherjee4 mention a stimulating property of the extract on such a preparation. (Dr. R. P. Banerjee, of the Indian Council for Medical Research, prepared extracts of Rauwolfia serpentina in three different concentrations of hydrochloric acid (namely, 2, 5 and 10 per cent) with the view of fractionating the different active principles. The results obtained with an extract in 2 per cent hydrochloric acid are described here; those with 5 and 10 per cent acid extracts are under investigation.)"

It combines the principles of Kunkel's1 aspirator for the collection of insects and Maramorosch's2 leaf-feeding cage, so that insects can be sucked direct into the feeding cages."
