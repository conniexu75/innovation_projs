https://openalex.org/W2130850001,"Recent studies have demonstrated that fatty acids induce insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by blocking insulin activation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)-associated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). To examine the mechanism by which fatty acids mediate this effect, rats were infused with either a lipid emulsion (consisting mostly of 18:2 fatty acids) or glycerol. Intracellular C18:2 CoA increased in a time-dependent fashion, reaching an approximately 6-fold elevation by 5 h, whereas there was no change in the concentration of any other fatty acyl-CoAs. Diacylglycerol (DAG) also increased transiently after 3-4 h of lipid infusion. In contrast there was no increase in intracellular ceramide or triglyceride concentrations during the lipid infusion. Increases in intracellular C18:2 CoA and DAG concentration were associated with protein kinase C (PKC)-theta activation and a reduction in both insulin-stimulated IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and IRS-1 associated PI3-kinase activity, which were associated with an increase in IRS-1 Ser(307) phosphorylation. These data support the hypothesis that an increase in plasma fatty acid concentration results in an increase in intracellular fatty acyl-CoA and DAG concentrations, which results in activation of PKC-theta leading to increased IRS-1 Ser(307) phosphorylation. This in turn leads to decreased IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and decreased activation of IRS-1-associated PI3-kinase activity resulting in decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport activity."

Ribosomal RNA analysis suggests that uncultivated organisms are found in nearly every prokaryotic group, and several divisions have no known cultivable representatives. We designed a diffusion chamber that allowed the growth of previously uncultivated microorganisms in a simulated natural environment. Colonies of representative marine organisms were isolated in pure culture. These isolates did not grow on artificial media alone but formed colonies in the presence of other microorganisms. This observation may help explain the nature of microbial uncultivability."
https://openalex.org/W2151136700,"The evolution of cooperation among nonrelated individuals is one of the fundamental problems in biology and social sciences. Reciprocal altruism fails to provide a solution if interactions are not repeated often enough or groups are too large. Punishment and reward can be very effective but require that defectors can be traced and identified. Here we present a simple but effective mechanism operating under full anonymity. Optional participation can foil exploiters and overcome the social dilemma. In voluntary public goods interactions, cooperators and defectors will coexist. We show that this result holds under very diverse assumptions on population structure and adaptation mechanisms, leading usually not to an equilibrium but to an unending cycle of adjustments (a Red Queen type of evolution). Thus, voluntary participation offers an escape hatch out of some social traps. Cooperation can subsist in sizable groups even if interactions are not repeated, defectors remain anonymous, players have no memory, and assortment is purely random."
https://openalex.org/W2012598468,"E2F-6 contributes to gene silencing in a manner independent of retinoblastoma protein family members. To better elucidate the molecular mechanism of repression by E2F-6, we have purified the factor from cultured cells. E2F-6 is found in a multimeric protein complex that contains Mga and Max, and thus the complex can bind not only to the E2F-binding site but also to Myc- and Brachyury-binding sites. Moreover, the complex contains chromatin modifiers such as a novel histone methyltransferase that modifies lysine 9 of histone H3, HP1gamma, and Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. The E2F-6 complex preferentially occupies target promoters in G0 cells rather than in G1 cells. These data suggest that these chromatin modifiers contribute to silencing of E2F- and Myc-responsive genes in quiescent cells."
https://openalex.org/W2155325845,"Ceramides are known to play a major regulatory role in apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We have previously reported that C2- and C16-ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, form large channels in planar membranes (Siskind, L. J., and Colombini, M. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38640–38644). Here we show that ceramides do not trigger a cytochrome c secretion or release mechanism, but simply raise the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane, via ceramide channel formation, to include small proteins. Exogenously added reduced cytochromec was able to freely permeate the mitochondrial outer membrane with entry to and exit from the intermembrane space facilitated by ceramides in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The permeability pathways were eliminated upon removal of C2-ceramide by bovine serum albumin, thus ruling out a detergent-like effect of C2-ceramide on membranes. Ceramide channels were not specific to cytochrome c, as ceramides induced release of adenylate kinase, but not fumerase from isolated mitochondria, showing some specificity of these channels for the outer mitochondrial membrane. SDS-PAGE results show that ceramides allow release of intermembrane space proteins with a molecular weight cut-off of about 60,000. These results indicate that the ceramide-induced membrane permeability increases in isolated mitochondria are via ceramide channel formation and not a release mechanism, as the channels that allow cytochrome c to freely permeate are reversible, and are not specific to cytochromec. Ceramides are known to play a major regulatory role in apoptosis by inducing cytochrome c release from mitochondria. We have previously reported that C2- and C16-ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, form large channels in planar membranes (Siskind, L. J., and Colombini, M. (2001)J. Biol. Chem. 275, 38640–38644).

Thus, ceramides may act on mitochondria to induce apoptosis.In most cell types, a key event in apoptosis is the release of proteins from the intermembrane space of mitochondria to the cytoplasm, including apoptosis-inducing factor, cytochrome c, procaspases, and heat shock proteins (14Bernardi P.

In general, it is the release of these intermembrane space proteins that activates caspases and DNase that are responsible for the execution of apoptosis. Short-chain cell permeable ceramide analogues such asN-acetyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C2-ceramide)1and N-hexanoyl-d-erythro-sphingosine (C6-ceramide) have been shown to induce cytochromec release when added to whole cell cultures (20Zamzami N.

We hypothesize that ceramide channels forming in the outer mitochondrial membrane are responsible for the ceramide-induced cytochrome c release. We have reported that both short- and long-chain ceramides form large channels in planar membranes (34Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol.

Others have reported ceramide-induced increases in the permeability of liposomes (35Simon C.G., Jr. Gear A.R.L.

They showed that sphingomyelinase treatment of large unilamellar vesicles containing sphingomyelin gives rise to release of fluorescein-derivatized dextrans of molecular weight of about 20,000, i.e. larger than cytochrome c (37Montes L.R.

Dihydroceramide, despite the fact that it differs from ceramide only by the reduction of one double bond, does not induce apoptosis nor form channels (34Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The ceramide channels are composed of many ceramide monomers and thus their formation is exceedingly sensitive to the free ceramide concentration. Altering the activity of local enzymes that synthesize and catabolize ceramide would cause channels to assemble or disassemble thus regulating the permeability of the outer membrane to small proteins.Ceramides have been reported to have other effects on mitochondria including enhanced generation of reactive oxygen species (20Zamzami N.

It is therefore unclear whether ceramide acts directly or indirectly on cytochrome c release.Here we show that treatment of rat liver mitochondria with either C2- or C16-ceramide causes the outer membrane to be freely permeable to cytochrome c, not just cytochromec release, and allows the release of proteins of up to about 60 kDa from the intermembrane space. The permeability increase induced by C2-ceramide is largely reversed by treatment with fatty acid-depleted bovine serum albumin (BSA). These results bolster the hypothesis that ceramide-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria is via the formation of ceramide channels in dynamic equilibrium with ceramide in other structural states.DISCUSSIONThe results of this paper extend our previous observations that C2- and C16-ceramide form large stable channels in planar membranes to isolated mitochondria. Here, several predictions/criteria for channel formation were utilized to test our hypothesis that ceramide channels, similar to the ones that we observe in planar phospholipid membranes, form in the mitochondrial outer membrane, raising its permeability to intermembrane space proteins. The results of this paper show that by fulfilling all of the criteria for channel formation, the ceramide-induced increases in the permeability of isolated rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes were in fact because of ceramide channels.First, as expected for a channel, the ceramides do not simply allow the release of cytochrome c or trigger a release mechanism, but allow its bidirectional flux across the outer mitochondrial membrane (Fig. 2). Our results strongly argue for specific pathways, channels of a size capable of allowing the passage of proteins. They are inconsistent with a specific pathway for cytochrome c. Ghafourifar et al. (29Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Pruschy M. Rocha S. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) showed an increase in the release of mitochondrial proteins apart from cytochrome c upon treatment of isolated rat liver mitochondria with C2- and C6-ceramide. However, it should be noted that in their experiments they only found release of cytochrome c and other mitochondrial proteins by ceramide when cytochrome cwas mainly oxidized, achieved after blocking complex III (29Ghafourifar P. Klein S.D. Schucht O. Schenk U. Pruschy M. Rocha S. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6080-6084Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). In contrast, we found release of adenylate kinase (Table I) and other proteins of similar size from mitochondria (Fig. 4, a andb) when complex III was not blocked. Similarly, Di Paolaet al. (28Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) reported C2- and C16-ceramide-induced cytochrome c release from isolated mitochondria without blocking complex III. In addition, we found that exogenously added reduced cytochrome c was able to cross the outer mitochondrial membrane of mitochondria incubated with either C2- or C16-ceramide; hence, we found no correlation between the redox state of cytochrome cand its ability to transverse the outer mitochondrial membrane via ceramide channels.Second, as would be expected for a channel, the permeability pathways in the mitochondrial outer membranes were eliminated by removal of ceramide. The permeability barrier of the mitochondrial outer membranes was almost completely restored when BSA removed C2-ceramide and this mirrors exactly the results obtained with C2-ceramide channels reconstituted into planar membranes. The simplest conclusion is that C2-ceramide forms the same channels in both mitochondrial and phospholipid membranes and these channels are in dynamic equilibrium with monomers in solution. As BSA binds monomers reducing the monomer concentration, the channels disassemble. The fact that the integrity of planar membranes and the outer membranes of isolated mitochondrial suspensions can be restored upon removal of ceramide monomers argues against an indirect action by ceramide in our system. Ceramides might act indirectly by triggering the permeability transition or catalyzing the insertion and channel formation by Bax or by triggering lipid reorganization in a detergent-like manner. Whereas not specifically excluding any of these possibilities for the in vivo situation, clearly our results in isolated mitochondria can be easily explained by ceramide channel formation without the need for ancillary factors. In fact, Polsteret al. (54Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) found no Bax associated with mitochondria isolated from rat liver. In addition, in the planar membrane experiments no proteins were used except for BSA.Third, the ceramide-induced increase in the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membranes was not specific to cytochrome c. The ceramide channels allow the release of other intermembrane space proteins and, as expected for a channel, there was a distinct molecular weight cut-off for the proteins released at about 60,000. This cut-off is in line with the sizes of proteins that were released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space during apoptosis (55Susin S.A. Lorenzo H.K. Zamzami N. Marzo I. Snow B.E.

The observed cut-off is a lower limit because the proteins have been reduced to individual polypeptides by treatment with SDS under reducing conditions. In addition, no effects were observed when the biologically inactive C18-dihydroceramide was used and this was in harmony with the inability of this molecule to form channels in phospholipid membranes (34Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar).It has been suggested that C2-ceramide can cause unspecific increases in membrane permeability via perturbation of the membrane structure (1Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 28Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 35Simon C.G., Jr. Gear A.R.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2059-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 58Hoffman K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In addition, there has been recent controversy over the type of ceramide used in apoptosis research. The majority of experiments with cells and isolated mitochondria have used short-chain cell-permeable ceramides (such as C2- or C6-ceramide) because of their ease in handling. However, these short-chain ceramides are not the major forms found in cells and their use has been criticized because they were thought to cause an unspecific increase in membrane permeability (28Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 58Hoffman K. Dixit V.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 226-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). For example, Di Paola et al. (28Di Paola M. Cocco T. Lorusso M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6620-6628Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showed that only C2-ceramide, but not C16-ceramide, was able to dissipate the inner mitochondrial membrane potential and the potential in complex III-reconstituted liposomal vesicles. However, we argue that the differences between short- and long-chain ceramides lies in their ability to insert and exchange between membranes. The virtually non-existent second acyl chain leads to a much higher water solubility and thus short-chain ceramides would be expected to be able to partition promiscuously into different populations of membranes, whereas long-chain ceramides would be expected to exert their effects only locally. Indeed, Simon et al. (59Simon C.G., Jr. Holloway P.W. Gear A.R.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14676-14682Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) found that the rate of exchange of C16-ceramide between populations of lipid vesicles was on the order of days.Short-chain ceramides have also been proposed to have detergent-like effects on membranes. Amphipathic molecules are labeled as detergents based on a variety of properties such as the ability to dissolve relatively insoluble molecules into an aqueous environment, ability to disrupt membranes by solubilizing components and favoring the formation of micelles, possessing a relatively high critical micellar concentration, and the like. Often, molecules that act as channels or carriers display detergent-like behavior by destabilizing membranes. However, the fact that ceramides do not destabilize solvent-free planar phospholipid membranes and form channels in said membranes demonstrates that they are not significantly detergent-like. We argue that C2-ceramide does not cause cytochrome c release by simply rupturing or dissolving the outer membrane in a detergent-like manner because its effects are reversible,i.e. the low permeability of the membrane can be restored. In addition, whereas some might argue that a detergent-like effect may also be reversible with BSA, disruption of the outer membrane with digitonin was not reversed by washing away the digitonin. In addition, detergents would not have a molecular weight cut-off for the proteins released from the mitochondrial intermembrane space as was the case for ceramides. Finally, erythrocytes are sensitive to detergent-induced lysis, but we found no such effect with C2-ceramide added at a ratio of ceramide to surface membrane lipids that was 4-fold higher than those used in the experiments reported here (data not shown). Most importantly, it was the combined results of testing all three predictions of channel activity that allows us to conclude that ceramide-induced increases in the permeability of outer membranes isolated from rat liver mitochondria was through ceramide channel formation.To apply our results obtained with isolated mitochondria to thein vivo situation, one must first consider the levels of ceramide used and whether or not they were physiologically relevant. At a ratio of 18 nmol of ceramide/mg of mitochondrial proteins,if all of the added ceramide inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane then the ceramide would constitute about 14 mol % of the outer membrane phospholipids. The ceramide content of isolated healthy rat liver mitochondria has been measured at 1.7 nmol/mg of protein (60Ardail D. Popa I. Alcantara K. Pons A. Zanetta J.P. Louisot P. Thomas L. Portoukalian J. FEBS Lett. 2001; 488: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). If all of the ceramide was inserted into the mitochondria then there would be about a 10-fold increase in ceramide above the level of ceramide in healthy rat liver mitochondria. Apoptotic agents can cause up to 20-fold increases in cellular ceramide levels (1Radin N.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and these represent average increases for the entire cell. Local increases in ceramide may very well be of a much higher magnitude. (Ongoing research in our laboratory indicates that only about 10% of the C2-ceramide added actually gets into the mitochondria.)Another consideration was the way ceramide levels could be raised locally. Enzymes capable of both de novo synthesis (ceramide synthase) and hydrolysis (ceramidase) have been found in mitochondria (61Shimeno H. Soeda S. Sakamoto M. Kouchi T. Kowakame T. Kihara T. Lipids. 1998; 33: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 62El Bawab S. Roddy P. Qian T. Bielawska A. Lemasters J.J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21508-21513Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). (The de novo synthetic pathway was distinct from ceramide generation in the plasma membrane through the breakdown of sphingomyelin.) Altering the activity of one or both of these mitochondrial enzymes would change the local steady-state level of ceramide thus increasing or decreasing the propensity for channel formation. Garcia-Ruiz et al. (40Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) reported that mitochondria isolated from cells treated with tumor necrosis factor showed a 2–3-fold increase in mitochondrial ceramide concentrations as compared with control cells. Their failure to increase mitochondrial ceramide levels by adding sphingomyelinases (40Garcia-Ruiz C. Colell A. Mari M. Morales A. Fernandez-Checa J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11369-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar) indicates that the increase was most likely through de novo synthesis. Ionizing radiation has been shown to induce both a prolonged ceramide generation exclusively within mitochondrial membranes and an increase in mitochondrial ceramide synthase activity. 2H. Lee, Z. Fuks, A. Rimmer, D. Ehleiter, J. Reed, W. Liao, and R. Kolesnick, manuscript in preparation. Other reports show that many chemotherapy drugs and radiation that induce ceramide generation do so via the de novo synthesis route (9Bos"

Genome-scale constraints-based models of Escherichia coli metabolism have been constructed and used to successfully interpret and predict cellular behavior under a range of conditions.

Umayam L.A. Dickinson T. Hickey E.K. White O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) has made it possible to develop in silico models of cellular behavior at a genome scale. One approach to the construction of in silico models that has proven useful in studying biological systems is based on the imposition of governing constraints (2Palsson B.O. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). In the constraints-based approach, a metabolic network is reconstructed by identifying metabolic genes and the corresponding reactions from the annotated genome sequence as well as from the relevant literature (3Covert M.W. Schilling C.H. Famili I. Edwards J.S. Goryanin I.I. Selkov E. Palsson B.O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 179-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The capabilities of the reconstructed network are described by a solution space that contains all possible steady-state metabolic flux distributions in the network. The solution space is formed by the imposition of physicochemical constraints that restrict the behavior of the network, such as the steady-state mass balance of metabolites, the effective irreversibility of reactions due to thermodynamic constraints, or the maximum flux capacity of enzymes or transport proteins. These physicochemical constraints are fixed invariants of the system, and the resulting constrained solution space may be thought of as a general solution space wherein every possible homeostatic state of the cell must lie. Flux-balance analysis (FBA)1can be used to identify particular behaviors within the allowable solution space, such as behaviors that produce the highest possible growth rate or production of a particular metabolite (4Edwards J.S. Ramakrishna R. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Lee S.Y. Papoutsakis E.T. Metabolic Engineering. Marcel Deker, New York1999: 13-57Google Scholar). FBA has been used to generate quantitative hypotheses about E. coli that have subsequently been tested experimentally, such as the growth characteristics of mutant strains (8Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar), optimality of growth on single-substrate minimal media (9Edwards J.S. Ibarra R.U. Palsson B.O. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar), and time courses of growth and metabolic by-product secretion (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A previously published genome-scale E. coli in silico model takes into account the metabolism of the organism based on 660 metabolic genes found in the E. coli K-12 MG 1655 genome (8Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). It has been estimated that about 400 regulatory genes exist in the genome of E. coli (10Thieffry D. Huerta A.M. Perez-Rueda E. Collado-Vides J. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 11Serres M.H. Gopal S. Nahum L.A. Liang P. Gaasterland T. M. R. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0035.0031-0035.0037Crossref Google Scholar); of these, 178 regulatory and putative regulatory genes were found during genome annotation (12Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar). Transcriptional regulation in E. coli has a significant effect on cell behavior. The incorporation of regulatory constraints into flux-balance models has been described (6Covert M.W. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 213: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 B). External signals, such as the presence of glucose in the extracellular environment, alter the affinity of regulatory proteins to operator or inhibitor sites on the genome. As a result, a gene may or may not be transcribed during a given time interval, and thus the corresponding biochemical reactions may or may not be active in the metabolic network under the given conditions. The reduced number of active reactions in the network leads to a smaller solution space. If the behavior exhibited previously by the cell is no longer found in the reduced solution space, then the solution shifts, meaning that a new growth behavior must be found and expressed. In this study, a regulatory network was reconstructed for central metabolism in E. coli. This regulatory network was then incorporated into an existing E. coli central metabolic model and used to simulate E. coli behavior under a variety of environmental conditions and genome perturbations. The metabolic network was reconstructed by identifying a set of biochemical reactions in the central E. coli metabolism, taken from the annotated genome sequence (11Serres M.H. Gopal S. Nahum L.A. Liang P. Gaasterland T. M. R. Genome Biol. 2001; 2: 0035.0031-0035.0037Crossref Google Scholar, 12Blattner F.R. Plunkett 3rd, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J.

Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (6081) Google Scholar) as well as from biochemical and physiological literature (13Neidhardt, F. C. (ed) (1996) Escherichia Coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology, 2nd Ed. 2 vols., ASM Press, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar, 14Salgado H. Santos-Zavaleta A. Gama-Castro S. Millán-Zárate D. Dı́az-Peredo E. Sánchez-Solano F. Pérez-Rueda E. Bonavides-Martı́nez C. Collado-Vides J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 72-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The regulatory network was derived from the literature data (cited in the supplemental material) and represented as a set of regulatory rules following established procedures (6Covert M.W. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 213: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). These rules were based on external conditions (e.g. the presence or absence of extracellular molecules) and/or internal conditions (e.g. the activity or inactivity of an enzymatic flux in a given environment) of the system. To accommodate the generally qualitative nature of existing transcriptional regulatory data, regulatory constraints were described using a Boolean formalism (15Thomas R. J. Theor. Biol. 1973; 42: 563-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) in which gene products are either available (ON) or unavailable (OFF) to the cell. The regulatory rules can be computed using commercially available software packages, including EXCEL (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA). Once the metabolic and regulatory networks were defined, FBA was used to determine an optimal metabolic flux distribution for the given conditions. FBA has been described and reviewed in detail (4Edwards J.S. Ramakrishna R. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. Lee S.Y. Papoutsakis E.T. Metabolic Engineering. Marcel Deker, New York1999: 13-57Google Scholar, 16Bonarius H.P.J. Schmid G. Tramper J. Trends Biotechnol. 1997; 15: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and is based on the location of optimal flux distributions within the solution space defined by a metabolic network and governing constraints, as described above. For the purposes of these simulations, capacity constraints included maximum uptake rates of oxygen as well as substrates such as glucose, acetate, and lactose, as determined from growth experiments found in the literature (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) (see Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 for numerical values). It has been demonstrated forE. coli under various conditions that cell growth may be used as an objective function (9Edwards J.S. Ibarra R.U. Palsson B.O. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar, 18Kompala D.S. Ramkrishna D. Jansen N.B. Tsao G.T. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 1986; 28: 1044-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar); the production of growth precursors in certain ratios was used here as an approximation (19Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Schaechter M. Physiology of the Bacterial Cell. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA1990: 87-173Google Scholar).

Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 213: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Regulatory constraints were applied to the network under steady-state conditions by evaluating whether genes were expressed or repressed for the given conditions (based on the aforementioned regulatory rules) and by constraining the fluxes of repressed gene products to zero. If a gene product was expressed, the actual flux value was determined by FBA. Thus, although the regulatory network is based on qualitative rules, the flux distribution determined by FBA is a quantitative result. The time constants that describe metabolic transients are fast (on the order of milliseconds to tens of seconds) as compared with the time constants associated with transcriptional regulation (generally on the order of a few minutes or slower) or cell growth (on the order of hours to days) (6Covert M.W. Schilling C.H. Palsson B.O. J. Theor. Biol. 2001; 213: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Therefore, dynamic simulations may be performed by considering the behavior inside the cell to be in a quasi-steady state during short time intervals relative to the environment (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Beginning at time zero, the simulation was run in small time steps (3 s for this study). For each time step, the regulatory rules were evaluated based on current environmental and internal conditions of the cell to determine the up- or down-regulation of every regulated gene. If a gene was determined to be up-regulated at a given time, the corresponding reactions in the metabolic system were considered unconstrained (by gene regulation) after a time delay to allow for protein synthesis. Conversely, the down-regulation of a gene resulted in the corresponding reactions being constrained to zero after a time delay to allow for protein degradation. The resulting sets of regulated genes that were present or absent for a particular time interval were used to generate the qualitative in silicoexpression arrays, which indicate whether or not a certain gene is being transcribed for a given time interval. Similarly, an in silico protein activity array was generated to show the activity of a certain regulatory protein at a given time. The time delay associated with gene transcription and protein synthesis is a required parameter and was estimated for each dynamic simulation (see Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Once the regulatory constraints for a particular time step were applied to the system, the optimal flux distribution was calculated as described above. The optimal flux distribution was then used to calculate cell growth, substrate uptake, and metabolic by-product secretion using numerical integration as described earlier (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The time courses of cell growth, substrate uptake, and by-product secretion were generated using a spreadsheet software package (EXCEL, Microsoft Corporation). To simulate deletion of a metabolic gene from the network, the flux through the corresponding gene product was set to zero for all conditions. Regulatory gene deletion was simulated by setting the expression of the gene to OFF. The regulatory network associated with the central metabolism forE. coli was reconstructed and combined with a previously developed central metabolic model (8Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 20Schilling C.H. Edwards J.S. Letscher D. Palsson B.O. Biotechnol.

The analysis of the combined metabolic/regulatory network using FBA may be called regulatory flux-balance analysis (rFBA). The rFBA network accounts for 149 genes, the products of which include 16 regulatory proteins and 73 enzymes, which catalyze 113 reactions. The synthesis of 43 of the enzymes in this model is controlled by transcriptional regulation; as a result, the availability of 45 of the reactions to the system is controlled by a logic statement. The details of the rFBA network may be found in the supplemental material. The metabolic/regulatory network was used in a retrospective analysis of experimental data to determine the ability of the rFBA model to make accurate phenotypic predictions. A mutant study as well as the dynamic simulation of growth under three environmental conditions (aerobic growth on glucose with acetate reutilization, glucose fermentation, and a mixed aerobic glucose-lactose batch culture) are described here. The rFBA model was used to ascertain the ability of mutant strains of E. coli to grow on defined media. For this study, 116 cases were examined and are shown in TableI. In each case, the experimental data were compared with predictions of both the rFBA model and the FBA (i.e. purely metabolic) model (8Edwards J.S. Palsson B.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5528-5533Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). The FBA model alone was able to correctly predict growth characteristics in 97 cases, or 83.6% of the given cases. Incorrect predictions were made for 16 of the 116 cases, and in three of the cases, predictions were not possible for the FBA model alone becauserpiR is a regulatory gene and therefore only included in the rFBA model.Table IComparison of experimental mutant studies with in silico predictions of the FBA and rFBA models under various conditionsResults are scored as + or − meaning growth or no growth determined from in vivo/FBA/rFBA data.

The rFBA model made correct predictions about growth characteristics in 106 or 91.4% of the 116 cases, an improvement of nine correct predictions over the unregulated metabolic model. The mutants whose growth capabilities were correctly predicted by the rFBA model, but not the FBA model alone, were aceEF, fumA,ppc, rpiA, and rpiR. The remaining incorrect predictions are detailed in Table I and are usually due to accumulation of toxic substances, an effect not yet predictable by this approach. The rFBA model was used to examine the above nine correct predictions in more detail. According to the predictions of the rFBA model, pyruvate dehydrogenase, encoded by the aceEF-lpdA operon, is a lethal mutation in E. coli for growth on minimal glucose and minimal succinate media under aerobic conditions due to the aerobic down-regulation of its fermentative counterpart, pyruvate formate-lyase. Similarly, fumarase A (fumA) is the only fumarase that is generally transcribed under aerobic conditions. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (ppc) was correctly predicted to be a lethal mutation due to the down-regulation of the glyoxylate shunt. The ribose phosphate isomerase A (rpiA) and the ribose repressor protein RpiR illustrate how regulatory gene mutant phenotypes may be simulated using rFBA. Two isomerases exist in E. colifor the interconversion of ribulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate, encoded for by the rpiA and rpiB genes. Although the expression of rpiA is thought to be constitutive, expression of rpiB occurs in the absence of RpiR, which is inactivated by ribose (29Fraenkel, D. G. (1996) in Escherichia Coli and Salmonella (Neidhardt, F. C., ed), Vol. 1, pp. 189–198, 2 vols., ASM Press, Washington, D. C.Google Scholar, 34Sorensen K.I. Hove-Jensen B. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result, rpiA mutants are ribose auxotrophs, whereas rpiB mutants exhibit a null phenotype. The further mutation of rpiR in rpiAmutants disables repression of rpiB and restores the ability to grow in the absence of ribose, as correctly predicted by the rFBA model. The rFBA model was used to simulate growth of E. coli quantitatively over the course of growth experiments. The resulting time courses of growth, substrate uptake, and by-product secretion were then compared with experimental data. E. coli has been observed to secrete acetate when grown aerobically on glucose in batch cultures; when glucose is depleted from the environment, the acetate is then reutilized as a substrate. Using the rFBA and FBA models, an aerobic batch culture of E. colion glucose minimal medium was simulated; the calculations are shown together with experimental data (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.3). The major difference between the rFBA and FBA simulations is in the delayed reaction of the system to depletion of glucose in the growth medium. The stand-alone metabolic network does not account for the delays associated with protein synthesis. An in silico expression array and a regulatory protein activity array were also generated (Fig. 3 C). The in silico array predicted the up-regulation of four gene products,aceA, aceB, acs, and ppsA, as well as the down-regulation of three gene products, adhE,ptsGHI-crr, and pykF. DNA microarray technology has been used to detect differential transcription profiles on a collection of 111 genes in E. coli (36Oh M.-K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The difference in gene expression for aerobic growth on acetate versus growth on glucose as reported in Ref. 36Oh M.-K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar is included in Fig. 3 C. The calculated expression of the eight genes included in the rFBA model for which expression data were published was in qualitative agreement with the predictions of the rFBA model. The ability of the rFBA model to reutilize acetate depends on the up-regulation of the glyoxylate shunt genes, aceA and aceB, which explains the high magnitude of transcription difference (20-fold) reported in Ref.36Oh M.-K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar. Importantly, the rFBA model suggests an interpretation for the regulation of two genes that were found to be regulated but by unknown causes, ppsA and adhE (36Oh M.-K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The rFBA model indicates that a second regulatory shift is induced by catabolite activator protein Cra, which responds to falling intracellular concentrations of fructose 6-phosphate and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate once glucose is depleted from the medium. This second regulatory shift is responsible for up-regulation of ppsA and down-regulation of adhE, crr, ptsG,ptsHI, and pykF according to the rFBA model. The next case studied using the rFBA model was anaerobic growth on glucose (5Varma A. Palsson B.O. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1994; 60: 3724-3731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4). Under these conditions, the FBA model makes similar predictions as the rFBA model with one exception: the rFBA model is able to make predictions about the use of a particular isozyme. For example, both models require fumarase activity as part of the optimal flux distribution; however, only the rFBA model is able to specify the fumB gene product, which is expressed anaerobically (37Tseng C.P. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 157: 67-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The final case examined for this study involved aerobic growth ofE. coli on glucose and lactose. This case has been studied in detail by many groups (17Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 38Wong P. Gladney S. Keasling J.D. Biotechnol. Prog. 1997; 13: 132-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 39Adhya S. Lin E.C.C. Lynch A.S. Regulation of Gene Expression in Escherichia coli. R. G. Landes Company, Austin, TX1996: 181-200Crossref Google Scholar). For this study, mixed batch culture data as well as the predictions of a detailed kinetic model recently derived by Kremling et al. (17Kremling A. Bettenbrock K. Laube B. Jahreis K. Lengeler J.W. Gilles E.D. Metab Eng. 2001; 3: 362-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) were used for comparison. The rFBA model predictions are in good agreement with the data, comparable with the predictions made by the Kremling model, and far better than the predictions of the stand-alone FBA model (Fig.5). The failure of the stand-alone FBA model to accurately predict the results of this experiment is due to the concurrent uptake of glucose and lactose, resulting in much more rapid depletion of the substrates and a higher growth rate. Interestingly, because of the larger flux of carbon source uptake, the FBA model predicts that E. coli growth should be oxygen-limited rather than carbon-limited in this case. Accordingly, the secretion of acetate and formate is predicted. The rFBA model predicts that no secretion will occur under these conditions. The in silico arrays for the experiment (Fig. 5 C) show one shift in gene expression, occurring just under 5 h. The up-regulation of the lactose uptake and degradation machinery, together with key enzymes in galactose metabolism, enables the system to use lactose as a carbon source once the glucose in the medium has been depleted. Several approaches have been developed to mathematically model metabolic regulation and cell dynamics, as recently reviewed (40Smolen P. Baxter D.A. Byrne J.H. Bull. Math. Biol. 2000; 62: 247-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 41McAdams H.H. Arkin A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 199-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The majority of these approaches rely on extensive kinetic and other environmental information that is difficult to obtain. A combined model of E. coli central metabolism and regulation was reconstructed and analyzed using the constraints-based approach (2Palsson B.O. Nature Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 1147-1150Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The regulated model was used to simulate the viability of mutant strains, cellular growth, and by-product secretion under various environments and internal regulatory shifts under changing environmental conditions. The results of this study indicate the following: 1) the addition of regulatory constraints significantly improves the predictive capacity of flux-balance models in which regulatory effects have a dominant role in flux-balance models of metabolism; 2) regulatory constraints are also useful in the interpretation of dynamic behaviors observed in cell cultures; and 3) large-scale metabolic models constructed using the constraints-based framework can capture the essential behavioral features and systemic characteristics of an organism with relatively few parameters. The imposition of regulatory constraints on the solution space formed by the reconstructed network for the metabolism of an organism results in a smaller solution space that more accurately represents its behavior. This improved accuracy is readily seen in the results of the mutant study in which regulatory constraints were responsible for the correction of six false predictions made by the stand-alone FBA model. Furthermore, regulatory constraints enable the prediction of phenotype for regulatory gene mutations, as demonstrated by the threerpiR mutant predictions made using rFBA. The time courses generated for E. coli growth on glucose with acetate reutilization and glucose-lactose diauxie are examples for which regulatory constraints have a substantial impact on the simulation results, causing the simulation to better reflect the actual phenotype of the cell. The addition of regulatory constraints can be used to interpret simulation results of cellular growth and by-product secretion. The glucose/acetate simulation clearly suggests that up-regulation of the glyoxylate shunt enables the reutilization of acetate and that a second regulatory shift is responsible for regulation of genes such asppsA and adhE, both of which were found to be regulated for unknown reasons in a recent microarray study of these conditions (36Oh M.-K. Liao J.C. Biotechnol. Prog. 2000; 16: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). More intuitively, the simulation of glucose-lactose diauxic growth indicates that up-regulation of the gal andlac operons is vital to the diauxic shift observed. By comparing the rFBA simulations with those produced by the stand-alone FBA model, it may also be possible to infer causes of regulatory evolution. For example, in the case of glucose fermentation, the relatively small effect of regulation on the observed phenotype could suggest that this organism has evolved a system which can respond instantaneously to sudden oxygen deprivation. For the case of glucose-lactose diauxic growth, the stand-alone FBA model shows that the combined uptake of lactose and glucose could cause the system to be oxygen-limited rather than carbon-limited for biomass production, resulting in the secretion of acetate and formate and reducing the growth yield. This finding, combined with evidence that E. coli evolves to optimize its growth yield during growth on single-carbon source media (9Edwards J.S. Ibarra R.U. Palsson B.O. Nature Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (764) Google Scholar) 2R. U. Ibarra, J. S. Edwards, L. S. Ramos, and B. O. Palsson, submitted for publication. and that catabolite repression does not occur under starvation conditions under which the cell is carbon-limited rather than oxygen-limited (7Lendenmann U. Egli T. Microbiology (N.Y.). 1995; 141: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), suggests the hypothesis that regulation of substrate uptake may have evolved as a means of maintaining optimal growth yields on single substrates. Such a hypothesis obviously remains to be examined in detail yet is illustrative of the usefulness of such a model in generating hypotheses that address such broad and fundamental topics as regulatory network strategy. Finally, the ability of the combined model to accurately capture the essential behavioral features and systemic characteristics of central metabolism and regulation of E. coli with relatively few parameters illustrates the utility of the constraints-based framework for modeling microbial systems. This capability to interpret and predict complex biological functions in the absence of detailed parameters is particularly evident in the glucose-lactose example discussed above. In summary, a central regulatory network for E. coli has been generated, and the corresponding regulatory constraints have been applied to central metabolism, resulting in improved interpretation and prediction of the behavior of this organism under specified conditions. As this combined metabolic/regulatory network is expanded to reflect the entire state of knowledge about E. coli transcriptional regulation, it is expected that the resulting constraints will further constrict the solution space and contribute to a fuller understanding of the systemic properties of this organism. With efforts underway to reconstruct regulatory networks using microarray data (42Maki Y. Tominaga D. Okamoto M. Watanabe S. Eguchi Y. Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing, Kohala Coast, HI, January 3–7, 2001. World Scientific Press, Singapore2001: 446-458Google Scholar), it may be expected that rFBA models may soon be generated for other less characterized organisms. Interestingly, such in silico model development does permit the generation of hypotheses about the systems biology of metabolism and regulation, which may be difficult to formulate without an in silico model.

https://openalex.org/W2127553031,"Five cognate G protein-coupled receptors (S1P1–5) have been shown to mediate various cellular effects of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Here we report the generation of mice null for S1P2 and for both S1P2 and S1P3. S1P2-null mice were viable and fertile and developed normally. The litter sizes from S1P2S1P3 double-null crosses were remarkably reduced compared with controls, and double-null pups often did not survive through infancy, although double-null survivors lacked any obvious phenotype. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were examined for the effects of receptor deletions on S1P signaling pathways. Wild-type MEFs were responsive to S1P in activation of Rho and phospholipase C (PLC), intracellular calcium mobilization, and inhibition of forskolin-activated adenylyl cyclase. S1P2-null MEFs showed a significant decrease in Rho activation, but no effect on PLC activation, calcium mobilization, or adenylyl cyclase inhibition. Double-null MEFs displayed a complete loss of Rho activation and a significant decrease in PLC activation and calcium mobilization, with no effect on adenylyl cyclase inhibition. These data extend our previous findings on S1P3-null mice and indicate preferential coupling of the S1P2 and S1P3receptors to Rho and PLC/Ca2+ pathways, respectively. Although either receptor subtype supports embryonic development, deletion of both produces marked perinatal lethality, demonstrating an essential role for combined S1P signaling by these receptors.

In part reflecting a lack of receptor subtype-specific agonists/antagonists and the universal expression of multiple S1P receptor genes in many single cell types, the in vivo roles of each receptor were unclear until the recent use of genetic approaches in mice (reviewed in Ref. 44Yang, A. H., Ishii, I., and Chun, J. (2002) Biochim. Biophys. Acta, in pressGoogle Scholar). Liu et al. (8Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T., Mi, Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J.

S1P1-null mice exhibit embryonic hemorrhage and incomplete vascular maturation, which lead to intrauterine death. S1P-induced cell migration and activation of the small GTPase Rac are severely defective in S1P1-null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), suggesting that the loss of S1P cellular signaling is relevant to those phenotypes found in S1P1-null mice (8Liu Y. Wada R. Yamashita T., Mi, Y. Deng C.X. Hobson J.P. Rosenfeldt H.M. Nava V.E. Chae S.S. Lee M.J. Liu C.H. Hla T. Spiegel S. Proia R.L. J. Clin.

S1P2-null mice were viable and apparently normal, as were S1P3-null mice. However, S1P-induced Rho activation was impaired. By contrast, PLC activation, intracellular calcium mobilization, and adenylyl cyclase inhibition were normal in S1P2-null MEFs. To determine whether the S1P2 and S1P3receptors serve redundant functions, we further generated mice null for these two receptor subtypes, S1P2S1P3double-null mice. A remarkable in vivo phenotype was found in double-null mice: markedly decreased litter sizes from double-null crosses. In addition, in vitro analysis of receptor function demonstrated that S1P-induced activation of Rho and PLC and intracellular calcium mobilization, but not adenylyl cyclase inhibition, were severely defective in double-null MEFs. These results identify a new physiological function for S1P receptor signaling and perinatal survival and indicate non-redundant signaling roles for these individual lysophospholipid receptors.

Each tissue (except brain) was dissected out, post-fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, and processed for paraffin embedding. Five-μm sections were cut, processed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin according to standard protocols. For brain analysis, whole brain was dissected out, post-fixed as described above, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, and sectioned on a cryostat. Twenty-μm sections were cut and then stained with cresyl violet according to standard protocols. MEFs were prepared from embryonic day 14 embryos generated by the wild-type or knockout (single or double) intercrosses as described previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C.

MEFs were maintained as a monolayer culture on tissue culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. Cells from the second to third passages were used for analyses. All functional assays except for the intracellular calcium mobilization assay were carried out as described previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, for the PLC assay, MEFs on 12-well dishes were prelabeled with [3H]inositol (2 μCi/well) in inositol- and serum-free medium for 24 h and stimulated with S1P or LPA in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer (14Ishii I. Izumi T. Tsukamoto H. Umeyama H., Ui, M. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7846-7854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). After a 20-min incubation, radioactivity in the inositol monophosphate + inositol bisphosphate + inositol trisphosphate fractions of the cell extracts was examined as described previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol.

For cAMP determination, MEFs on 24-well dishes were preincubated in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer containing 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min and then stimulated for 20 min with or without 1 μm forskolin in the presence or absence of S1P. cAMP contents were measured with the cAMP enzyme immunoassay system (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. The activity was expressed as percentages of basal levels or 1 μm forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation. For Rho and Rac assays (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), MEFs on 10-cm dishes were incubated for 10 min in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer and then stimulated for 3 min with S1P or LPA. Cells were lysed and incubated with Rhotekin Rho-binding domain- and PAK1 p21-binding domain-conjugated agarose beads, respectively. GTP-bound active forms of Rho or Rac protein were specifically detected by Western blot analysis using anti-RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-Rac1 (BD PharMingen) antibodies, respectively. Rho protein in 5% of the cell lysate and Rac protein in 1% of the cell lysate were also detected as references, respectively. For calcium mobilization assay, MEF cells were loaded with Fura 2/AM (1 μm) in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer for 1 h. The cells were successively stimulated with 10 μm S1P, 10 μm LPA, and 1 mm ATP in Hepes/Tyrode's/BSA buffer containing 1.8 mm CaCl2. Measurements of intracellular calcium concentration were performed using a Hitachi F-2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at excitation wavelengths of 340 and 380 nm and an emission wavelength of 510 nm. Conversion of the 340/380 nm ratio value into nanomolar intracellular Ca2+was estimated by comparing the cellular fluorescence ratio with ratios acquired with buffers containing known Ca2+concentrations. Data are the means ± S.E. of triplicate samples from a single experiment representative of two to three experiments that gave similar results. Statistical analyses were done by Student's t test or the χ2 test (in tables), and a difference of p < 0.01 was considered to be statistically significant. The genomic structure of s1p 2 consists of two exons, with the entire ORF encoded in the second exon (12Zhang G. Contos J.J. Weiner J.A. Fukushima N. Chun J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 227: 89-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Therefore, the entire ORF was deleted in R1 embryonic stem cells by replacing it with a neomycin-resistance gene (Fig.1 A). The correct integration of the targeting construct was confirmed by Southern blot analysis using probes both inside (Probe B) and outside (Probe A) of the ORF (Fig. 1, A and B, left panels). A single correctly targeted embryonic stem clone was injected into blastocysts, and a series of mice with mutateds1p 2 alleles (s1p 2+/− ors1p 2−/−) were established. Mice genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 1 B,right panel) or PCR (Fig. 1 C) analysis using tail genomic DNA. The complete absence of s1p 2transcripts in s1p 2−/− mice was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of adult tissues in whichs1p 2 is normally expressed at high levels (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol.

Moderate levels of s1p 2 expression were observed in s1p 2+/− tissues (Fig.1 D, left panel). In those tissues, several other S1P receptor genes (s1p 1 ands1p 3–5) and an LPA receptor gene (lpa 1) were also expressed. There were no significant changes in the expression levels of those genes related tos1p 2 deficiency. S1P2-null mice were generally obtained with the expected mendelian frequency and without sexual bias (TableI). S1P2-null mating produced S1P2-null pups, although the average litter size was modestly but significantly (p < 0.01) smaller than that from s1p 2+/− males × wild-type females (6.5 versus 8.6 pups/litter). The average size from s1p 2+/− males ×s1p 2−/− females (6.7 pups/litter) was smaller than that from s1p 2+/−males × wild-type females (8.6 pups/litter) or froms1p 2−/− males ×s1p 2+/− females (8.1 pups/litter) (Table I), suggesting possible defects ins1p 2−/− females, but not ins1p 2−/− males.Table IInheritance of the s1p 2 mutant allele Offspring genotypes at weaning ages (∼3 weeks)Parental genotypesTotal litter no.Average litter sizesMalesFemalesBoth sexesMale × FemaleWTHetKOWTHetKOWTHetKOHet × WT208.6 ± 2.6424846368884Het × Het567.8 ± 2.557100565612444113224100Het × KO246.7 ± 2.3424239378179KO × Het198.1 ± 2.3433829447282KO × KO226.5 ± 2.17369142Total litter numbers, average litter sizes (means ± S.D.), and numbers of genotyped offsprings from the indicated crosses are shown.

S1P2-null mice did not differ from the wild-type ors1p 2+/− littermates in gross appearance, general behavior, overall health, and longevity (through at least 20 months). There were no significant differences in body weights among s1p 2 genotypes in littermates at 4 or 8 weeks of age in each sex (data not shown). Routine histology was performed in major tissues (brain, heart, lung, thymus, liver, kidney, spleen, adipose tissues, skin, muscle, stomach, intestine, uterus, and testis) from mice at 10 days and 4 and 8 weeks of age and revealed no obvious differences among s1p 2 genotypes in littermates of either sex (data not shown). Also, routine hematology, including erythrocyte, leukocyte, and platelet counts; neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte, and eosinophil proportions; glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride serum levels; and lipase activity (9Ishii I.

The viability and fertility of both S1P2-null and S1P3-null mice (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol.

First,s1p 2+/− s1p 3+/−double-heterozygous mice were produced from any of the following crosses: s1p 2−/− males ×s1p 3−/− females,s1p 3−/− males ×s1p 2−/− females,s1p 2−/− s1p 3−/−males × wild-type females, and wild-type males ×s1p 2−/− s1p 3−/−females, which gave averages of 5.8–7.0 pups/litter (TableII). Next,s1p 2+/− s1p 3+/−mice were bred to produce 12s1p 2−/− s1p 3−/−mice (eight males and four females). The breeding produced severals1p 2+/− s1p 3−/−ors1p 2−/− s1p 3+/−mice, which were also used to produce double-null mice (Table II). The most striking phenotype of the double-null mice was revealed in the vastly reduced number of progeny obtained by crossing double-null mice, far less than expected based on the mendelian frequency (Table II).Table IIInheritance of the s1p 2 and s1p 3 mutant allelesParental genotypesTotal litter no.Average litter sizesOffspring genotypes at weaning ages (∼3 weeks)Sex ratio (female/male)Male×Female s1p 2-WT s1p 2-Het s1p 2-KO s1p 2 s1p 3 s1p 2 s1p 3 s1p 3-WT s1p 3-Het s1p 3-KO s1p 3-WT s1p 3-Het s1p 3-KO s1p 3-WT s1p 3-Het s1p 3-KOHetWT×WTWT208.6 ± 2.6888482:90WTHet×WTWT187.5 ± 2.7746159:76KOWT×WTKO227.0 ± 2.615372:81WTKO×KOWT236.7 ± 2.215369:84KOKO×WTWT246.7 ± 3.016188:73WTWT×KOKO155.8 ± 2.48736:51HetHet×HetHet735.8 ± 2.83448326211659223812193:230HetKO×HetHet215.2 ± 2.81716362113543:65KOHet×HetHet165.8 ± 2.516241216151046:47HetKO×HetKO474.6 ± 2.35512634105:110KOHet×KOHet133.9 ± 1.61431623:28KOKO×HetHet85.6 ± 3.91413111020:28KOKO×KOHet84.1 ± 1.8191318:14KOKO×KOKO211.2 ± 1.82613:13Total litter numbers, average litter sizes (means ± S.D.), and numbers of genotyped offspring from the indicated crosses are shown.

S1P2S1P3 double-null mice froms1p 2+/− s1p 3−/−intercrosses were analyzed with their S1P3-null littermates as controls because our previous studies did not reveal any major phenotypic abnormality in S1P3-null mice (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The complete absence of s1p 2 and s1p 3transcripts in double-null mice was confirmed by Northern blot analysis of RNA samples from heart, brain, lung, and spleen (Fig. 1 D,right panel). There was no obvious compensatory gene expression of other S1P receptors (Fig. 1 D, right panel). Double-null mice did not differ from their S1P3-null littermates in gross appearance, general behavior, overall health, body weight, and longevity (through at least 16 months) (data not shown). Routine histology and hematology did not reveal any gross differences related to S1P2 deficiency on the s1p 3−/− background (data not shown). However, double-null pups generated by double-null mating were lost perinatally at high frequency. Among 65 neonates (including carcasses) produced from 21 pregnancies, 39 neonates were found dead within 1 week after birth (most died within 24 h); the remaining 26 neonates survived to adulthood. Maternal negligence of pups was observed in most of the 13 pregnancies with no neonatal survivors, a phenomenon rarely observed in the other crosses. Among eight pregnancies that had survivors, one pregnancy had six survivors, two had four each, three had three each, one had two, and one had one (total of 26 mice). Unexpectedly, the neonatal survivors grew up normally and did not show any obvious abnormality with maturation. To determine the contribution of s1p 2 (and/ors1p 3) deletion to S1P cellular signaling, we analyzed MEF cells prepared from embryonic day 14 embryos. First, expression of the s1p genes in each cell preparation was examined by Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). Consistent with our previous observation (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), wild-type MEF cells expresseds1p 1–3, but neither s1p 4 nors1p 5. As expected, MEF cells from each of the mutants lacked expression of their corresponding s1pgene(s). There were no obvious compensatory changes in the expression of other S1P receptor genes or an LPA receptor gene,lpa 1 (Fig. 2). S1P concentration-dependent PLC activation was measured using radioisotope labeling methods (see “Experimental Procedures”). MEF cells express two LPA receptor genes (lpa 1and lpa 2) and were responsive to LPA in both PLC and Rho activation (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). 2J. J. A. Contos, I. Ishii, N. Fukushima, M. A. Kingsbury, X. Ye, and J. Chun, submitted for publication. The responses to LPA stimulation were comparable among the MEF cell types (4.3–6.0-fold induction above basal levels at 10 μm), and thus, S1P-induced responses were expressed as a percentage of the 10 μm LPA-induced response. As observed previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G. Brown J.H. Chun J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33697-33704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), wild-type MEF cells were highly responsive to S1P in PLC activation, whereas S1P3-null cells showed markedly diminished PLC activation in response to S1P (Fig.3). Deletion of the S1P2receptor did not affect this response because S1P-induced PLC activation in S1P2-null cells was comparable to that in wild-type cells, and that in S1P2S1P3double-null cells was comparable to that in S1P3-null cells (Fig. 3). These results indicate that the S1P2 receptor does not mediate PLC activation in response to S1P in these cells. This is consistent with our previous observation thats1p 2 overexpression does not affect S1P-induced PLC activation in S1P3-null MEF cells (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C.

S1P-induced intracellular calcium mobilization was measured by Fura 2/AM labeling methods (see “Experimental Procedures”). Wild-type MEF cells were highly responsive to both S1P and LPA (Fig.4 A). Deletion of S1P3, but not S1P2, in MEF cells resulted in no or minimal response to S1P in calcium mobilization, whereas responses to LPA or ATP were comparable among all MEF cell types (Fig. 4,B–D). These results indicate that S1P3, but not S1P2, plays a major role in S1P-induced intracellular calcium mobilization. First, we compared the effects of S1P on forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in each of the mutant MEF cells. The concentration-dependent inhibitory effects of S1P were comparable among wild-type, S1P2-null, and S1P2S1P3 double-null cells (Fig.5 A), indicating negligible contributions of either S1P2 or S1P3 to the adenylyl cyclase inhibitory actions of S1P. The inhibitory curve obtained with S1P3-null mice was slightly shifted rightward, as observed previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye, X. Kawamura S. McGiffert C. Contos J.J. Kingsbury M.A. Zhang G.

Next, we examined the effects of S1P on the basal cAMP levels in PTX-treated and PTX-untreated cells (Fig. 5 B). S1P did not affect the basal cAMP levels in PTX-untreated wild-type cells, as observed previously (9Ishii I. Friedman B., Ye"

Human and rat ENT1 and ENT2, which are also broadly selective for purine and pyrimidine nucleosides, are distinguished functionally by a difference in sensitivity to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine (NBMPR), hENT2 and rENT2 being NBMPR-insensitive (16Griffiths M.

They also differ in sensitivity to inhibition by the coronary vasodilator drugs dipyridamole, dilazep, and draflazine (hENT1 > hENT2 > rENT1 = rENT2). The relationships of these proteins to the transport processes defined by functional studies are: CNT1 (cit), 2The abbreviations used in nucleoside transporter acronyms are: c, concentrative; e, equilibrative;s and i, sensitive and insensitive to inhibition by nitrobenzylthioinosine, respectively; f, formycin B (nonmetabolized purine nucleoside); t, thymidine;b, broad selectivity. CNT2 (cif), CNT3 (cib), ENT1 (es), and ENT2 (ei). ENTs are widely distributed in other eukaryotes, but appear to be absent in prokaryotes, whereas CNTs are present in both (3Baldwin S.A. Mackey J.R.

The processes present in mammalian cells are less well defined, although both equilibrative (Na+-independent) and concentrative (Na+-dependent) nucleobase-specific transport activities have been described in a variety of different cell types and tissues (2Griffith D.A.

Equilibrative nucleobase transport has been found, for example, in human erythrocytes, human T-lymphoblastoid cells, pig renal epithelial cells, and S49 mouse-derived lymphoma cells (20Gati W.P.

Unlike nucleosides, little is known about the molecular basis of nucleobase transport in mammalian cells, and no cDNA encoding a functional mammalian nucleobase transporter has been cloned. Of three families of nucleobase transport proteins identified in bacteria, fungi, and plants (designated nucleobase-ascorbate transporters, PRT, and purine permease in Ref. 4de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar), only one (nucleobase-ascorbate transporters) has known orthologs in mammals. Of these, human and rat SVCT1 and SVCT2 function as Na+-dependent ascorbate transporters (28Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B. Berger U.V. Chen X.Z. Wang Y. Brubaker R.F.

Functional and molecular distinctions between nucleoside and nucleobase transport processes are not absolute. FUR4, for example, is a yeast PRT permease that transports both uracil and uridine (34Wagner R. deMonigny J. de Wergifosse P. Souciet J.L. Potier S. Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 159: 69-75Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas FUI1, another deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae PRT family member, transports uridine, but not nucleobases (35Vickers M. Yao S.Y.M. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Cass C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25931-25938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). PfENT1 is a purine nucleoside-selective ENT family member from Plasmodium falciparum that also transports nucleobases (36Parker M.D. Hyde R.J. Yao S.Y.M. McRobert L. Cass C.E. Young J.D. McConkey G.A. Baldwin S.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 67-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Similarly, there is evidence from flux studies for a role for mammalian nucleoside transporters in nucleobase transport (2Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 4de Koning H. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar). In the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line EVC 304 (37Osses N. Perason J.D. Yudilevich D.L. Jarvis S.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 317: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), radiolabeled hypoxanthine transport was inhibited by adenosine, thymidine, and uridine, and radiolabeled adenosine transport was inhibited by hypoxanthine. A shared mechanism for thymidine and hypoxanthine transport has also been reported for human breast MCF7 and T-47D adenocarcinoma cells (38Marshman E. Taylor G.A. Thomas H.D. Newell D.R. Curtin N.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2001; 61: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The molecular entities responsible for these dual nucleoside/nucleobase transport activities were not determined, although inhibition by high (micromolar) concentrations of NBMPR (EVC 304) and dipyridamole (MCF7 and T-47D) and the lack of Na+ dependence suggested involvement of the ei rather than the es,cit, cif, or cib processes. Results of earlier studies of hypoxanthine transport in mouse S49 lymphoma cells (39Aronow B. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2014-2019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had suggested a minor role of the es process in hypoxanthine translocation. Most cells express multiple nucleoside transport activities, making it technically difficult to evaluate the contributions of individual nucleoside transport processes to nucleobase translocation. This limitation can be overcome using recombinant DNA technology. Transport experiments in which recombinant human, rat, and mouse CNTs were produced individually in Xenopus oocytes and then evaluated for uridine/uracil uptake found that CNT1–3 did not transport uracil (12Ritzel M.W.L.

Similarly, we show here that recombinant hCNT1, rCNT1, hCNT2, rCNT2, and hCNT3 do not transport hypoxanthine, the nucleobase permeant used in the experiments with cultured EVC 304, MCF7, T-47D, and S49 cells. To determine the role of ENT proteins in nucleobase translocation, we also examined nucleobase fluxes in Xenopusoocytes producing recombinant hENT1, rENT1, hENT2, or rENT2. hENT2 was also produced in a purine nucleobase transport-deficient strain ofS. cerevisiae. Our results demonstrate that the human and rat ENT2 isoform has the dual capability of transporting both nucleosides and nucleobases, establishing ENT2 as the first identified mammalian nucleobase transporter protein. This newly demonstrated functional activity of human and rat ENT2 was exploited in chimeric studies of rENT1 and rENT2 to identify potential pore-lining regions of rENT2 responsible for nucleobase translocation. Recombinant human and rat ENTs and CNTs were produced in oocytes of Xenopus laevis by standard procedures (40Yao S.Y.M. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Membrane Transport: A Practical Approach.

At the end of the incubation period, extracellular label was removed by six rapid washes in ice-cold transport medium, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 5% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC, Beckman, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).

Briefly, yeast were grown in CMM/glucose to anA 600 of 0.8–1.5, washed three times in fresh medium, and resuspended to an A 600 of 2. Transport reactions were carried out at room temperature and initiated by the rapid addition of a small volume of radiolabeled permeant to a final concentration of 10 μm (1 μCi/ml). Uptake was terminated at graded time intervals by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 2 min) of 200-μl portions of yeast through equal volumes of transport oil contained in 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes. Oil was removed by aspiration, and the yeast pellets solubilized overnight in 5% (v/v) Triton X-100 for liquid scintillation counting. Blank values, corresponding to trapped extracellular space, were determined by mixing yeast with radiolabeled hypoxanthine (10 μm, 1 μCi/ml), followed by immediate centrifugation through oil. The flux values shown, corrected for trapped extracellular space, are presented as means ± S.E. of triplicate determinations. Each experiment was performed at least twice on different batches of cells. Membrane transport studies in various mammalian cell and tissue preparations have produced evidence that equilibrative (Na+-independent) cellular uptake of nucleosides involves two mediated processes (es and ei), both of which may also have a role in the transport of nucleobases (1Cass C.E.

We show here that MRS4 is co-regulated with the iron regulon genes, and up-regulated in a strain deficient for Yfh1p, the yeast homologue of human frataxin. Using in vivo 55Fe cell radiolabeling we show that in glucose-grown cells mitochondrial iron accumulation is 5–15 times higher in ΔYFH1 than in wild-type strain. However, although in a ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain, the intracellular 55Fe content is extremely high, the mitochondrial iron concentration is decreased to almost wild-type levels. Moreover, ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells grown in high iron media do not lose their mitochondrial genome. Conversely, a ΔYFH1 strain overexpressing MRS4 has an increased mitochondrial iron content and no mitochondrial genome. Therefore, MRS4 is required for mitochondrial iron accumulation in ΔYFH1 cells. Expression of the iron regulon and intracellular 55Fe content are higher in a ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain than in the wild type. Nevertheless, the mitochondrial 55Fe content, a balance between iron uptake and exit, is decreased by a factor of two. Moreover, 55Fe incorporation into heme by ferrochelatase is increased in an MRS4-overexpressing strain. The function ofMRS4 in iron import into mitochondria is discussed. The mitochondrial solute carriers Mrs3p and Mrs4p were originally isolated as multicopy suppressors of intron splicing defects. We show here that MRS4 is co-regulated with the iron regulon genes, and up-regulated in a strain deficient for Yfh1p, the yeast homologue of human frataxin. Using in vivo 55Fe cell radiolabeling we show that in glucose-grown cells mitochondrial iron accumulation is 5–15 times higher in ΔYFH1 than in wild-type strain. However, although in a ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain, the intracellular 55Fe content is extremely high, the mitochondrial iron concentration is decreased to almost wild-type levels. Moreover, ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells grown in high iron media do not lose their mitochondrial genome. Conversely, a ΔYFH1 strain overexpressing MRS4 has an increased mitochondrial iron content and no mitochondrial genome. Therefore, MRS4 is required for mitochondrial iron accumulation in ΔYFH1 cells. Expression of the iron regulon and intracellular 55Fe content are higher in a ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain than in the wild type. Nevertheless, the mitochondrial 55Fe content, a balance between iron uptake and exit, is decreased by a factor of two. Moreover, 55Fe incorporation into heme by ferrochelatase is increased in an MRS4-overexpressing strain. The function ofMRS4 in iron import into mitochondria is discussed. 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole Mitochondria utilize most of the cellular iron. First, the mitochondrial ferrochelatase catalyzes the insertion of ferrous iron into protoporphyrin IX, the heme precursor of cytochromes. Second, the mitochondrial matrix and respiratory chain contain several iron-sulfur proteins. Moreover, it has recently been discovered that iron-sulfur clusters are synthesized inside mitochondria by a specific machinery involving more than 10 proteins that have orthologues in bacteria (1Muhlenhoff U. Lill R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1459: 370-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar,2Craig E.A. Voisine C. Schilke B. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 1167-1173Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These iron-sulfur clusters are used for both mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins, and their export into the cytosol is probably mediated by the ABC transporter Atm1p (3Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). Based on their capacity to restore the low iron growth defect of an erg25 mutant (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), two homologous transporters belonging to the cation efflux transporter family (5Paulsen I.T. Sliwinski M.K. Nelissen B. Goffeau A. Saier M.H., Jr. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 116-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), Mmt1p and Mmt2p, have been reported to play a role in mitochondrial iron transport (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). However, the double deletion strain does not exhibit any respiratory defect, suggesting that the role played by MMT1 and MMT2 in mitochondrial iron metabolism is modest (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 6Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol.

Using DNA microarrays, we have shown that mitochondria play a key role in cellular iron homeostasis (7Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). This conclusion was reached by using a strain that has been deleted for YFH1, the yeast frataxin gene (8Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R. Davis-Kaplan S. Jiralerspong S. Montermini L. Pandolfo M. Kaplan J. Science. 1997; 276: 1709-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 9Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Frataxin is a small hydrophilic protein of unknown function conserved in the mitochondria of all eukaryotes. It has been reported that a multimeric form of frataxin is involved in iron sequestration (10Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In glucose-grown cells YFH1 deletion elicits mitochondrial iron overload (8Babcock M. de Silva D. Oaks R.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and prevents iron export from mitochondria (11Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This phenotype is associated with increased expression of the genes involved in iron mobilization in anAFT1-dependent manner (7Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Aft1p is an iron-sensing transcription factor that activates the transcription of a set of genes, the “iron regulon,” under cellular iron starvation conditions (12Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Dancis A. Klausner R.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1231-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). By analyzing published data of gene expression profiles obtained under 300 different conditions (13Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett HA Coffey E. Dai H., He, Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D. Chakraburtty K. Simon J. Bard M. Friend S.H. Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar) we found that theMRS4 and MMT2 genes are co-regulated with severalAFT1-dependent genes. These data suggest thatMRS4 and MMT2 play a role in iron metabolism. The homologous Mrs3p and Mrs4p proteins are located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and belong to the mitochondrial solute carrier family (14Wiesenberger G. Link T.A. von Ahsen U. Waldherr M. Schweyen R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 23-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains 35 of these carriers (15el Moualij B. Duyckaerts C. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Sluse F.E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 573-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Belenkiy R. Haefele A. Eisen M.B. Wohlrab H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1467: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the most studied of which is the mitochondrial ATP/ADP translocator. Mitochondrial carriers are characterized by three homologous domains, each containing two transmembrane spans.MRS3 and MRS4 were initially isolated as high copy number suppressors of mitochondrial mRNA splicing defects, particularly in mrs2 mutants (17Waldherr M. Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MRS2 encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein belonging to the bacterial CORA family of magnesium transporters and is involved in magnesium homeostasis (18Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Mrs3p and Mrs4p carriers have been conserved during evolution, and their human homologue can rescue the thermosensitive growth defect observed in a double ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 deletion yeast strain (19Li F.Y. Nikali K. Gregan J. Leibiger I. Leibiger B. Schweyen R. Larsson C. Suomalainen A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that these carriers play a role in metal transport. We thus decided to investigate whether MRS3 andMRS4 genes play a role in mitochondrial iron import. S. cerevisiae strains used in this study were the wild-type strain W303–1B (MAT α ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1) and its isogenic derivative W303–1BΔYFH1 (MAT α ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, yfh1Δ::KanR ) (9Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). W303ΔYFH1–3C (MAT α ura3-52, leu2-3, 112, trp1-1, his3-11,15, ade2-1, yfh1Δ::KanR ) is a meiotic segregant of a W303 heterozygous diploid bearing a deleted copy ofYFH1. The ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 and ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 deletion strains were obtained by transformation of W303–1B with the loxP-kanR-loxP gene disruption cassette procedure (20Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). This cassette contains the Kanamycin resistance marker and can repeatedly be excised by homologous recombination between loxP sites upon yeast transformation with a plasmid containing the Cre recombinase under the control of the GAL1 promoter (20Guldener U. Heck S. Fielder T. Beinhauer J. Hegemann J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2519-2524Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar). First, yeast strains were transformed by the loxP-kanR-loxP cassette flanked on each side by 40–50 bp homologous to the 5′ and 3′ regions of the gene of interest (21Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 13: 1793-1808Crossref Scopus (2232) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotide sequences were as follows: MRS3, 5′-GTTTGCTGTAAATATATTTATGTTATAAAAAAAGAAGATTATG (up) and 5′-GATGCAAAATGAATGGAAAATAATATGACATGTAAGAACCAACT (down);MRS4, 5′-AGTGAAGAAGTAAAAAACTCAACCGAAATATCAGTTAATATTATG (up) and 5′-TAAGTTGTCAAAAAAAGTTGACCTCGAAAAGGGGAAAAAACATCA (down);MMT1, 5′-TTATATATTATTGCATCACACAAACATCGCTTTCTTTTTCGCATTTTTGACA (up); 5′-TATTTTCGACATTTCCCTCTCTTCTTCACTTGTTATTATTACTGTGGGAAG (down);MMT2, 5′-GATAAGTATTGACTCTATCAAGCAATTCGGTTCCTTTGTGAC (up); 5′-ACAAACTCGACGTCCACCTTCCCACGTTTGGCACCTTCATAC (down). Singly deleted strains were thus obtained. Then, the deletion cassette was excised by the Cre recombinase, and a second deletion cassette obtained by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the genomic DNA of another deleted strain was used to transform the singly deleted strain and produce a double deletion strain. Strains W303-1BΔMMT1ΔMMT2, W303-1BΔMRS3ΔMRS4, and W303-1BΔMRS3ΔMRS4ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 were constructed. The mutants ΔYFH1ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 and ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 are meiotic segregants resulting from crosses between W303-1BΔMMT1ΔMMT2 (or W303-1BΔMRS3ΔMRS4) and W303ΔYFH1-3C. In the ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain, theMRS4 deletion was obtained by genomic integration of a linear deletion cassette containing the URA3 marker flanked by PCR-amplified DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′ and 3′ sides of the MRS4 gene. The strains were routinely grown in 2% glucose (or 3% glycerol), 2% yeast extract KAT, or in minimum glucose medium containing 2% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base Difco supplemented with required amino acids and bases. Synthetic raffinose medium contains 2% raffinose, 0.5% glucose, 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 0.5% ammonium sulfate, 0.05% yeast extract and is supplemented with amino acids. After an overnight culture in the appropriate medium, cells were inoculated to a final concentration of 20 × 106 cells/ml in 100 ml of the same medium containing 2 μm55Fe (FeCl3) and incubated with shaking for 3 h at 30 °C. Cells were harvested and washed two times with a solution of 100 mm sodium citrate and 10 mm EDTA, pH 6.5. Preparation of spheroplasts and mitochondria was carried out as described previously (9Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). The amount of 55Fe was estimated by scintillation counting of the radioactivity contained in the mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial fractions. The assay measuring55Fe import into isolated mitochondria by following the formation of 55Fe-deuteroheme was carried out as described (6Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the time of the publication of their article (13Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J.

The number of data points used in the correlation and the number of times the subject gene was regulated at a certain p value were also given. A paste of cells grown in the exponential phase of growth was reduced with dithionite in 0.7-mm-thick cuvettes and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Low temperature cytochrome absorption spectra were carried out, and cytochrome concentration was estimated as reported (22Claisse M.L. Pere-Aubert G.A. Clavilier L.P. Slonimski P.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1970; 16: 430-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). RNA peparation, Northern blotting analysis, and enzyme activities were carried out as described previously (7Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Magnesium and cobalt concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry on samples treated with 5:2 nitric acid/perchloric acid at 80 °C for 2 h. To discover new genes co-regulated with theAFT1-dependent iron regulon, we performed a search in the data base generated by Hughes et al. (13Hughes T.R. Marton M.J. Jones A.R. Roberts C.J. Stoughton R. Armour C.D. Bennett HA Coffey E. Dai H., He, Y.D. Kidd M.J. King A.M. Meyer M.R. Slade D. Lum P.Y. Stepaniants S.B. Shoemaker D.D. Gachotte D. Chakraburtty K. Simon J. Bard M. Friend S.H. Cell. 2000; 102: 109-126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2090) Google Scholar). Using DNA microarrays, the authors have obtained expression profiles for the complete genome of S. cerevisiae under 300 different conditions. A search for the genes most closely regulated with typical iron regulon genes such as FTR1, FET3,FRE2, or YOR383c led to detection ofMRS4 and MMT2 genes. Reciprocally, a search for genes closely regulated with MRS4 identified iron regulon genes. We have previously shown that the iron regulon is up-regulated in a ΔYFH1 strain (7Foury F. Talibi D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7762-7768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the expression ofMRS4 and MMT2 in wild-type and ΔYFH1 strains grown in glucose medium. By Northern blotting experiments we found that the mRNA levels of MRS4 and MMT2 were ∼2.5 times increased in a ΔYFH1 strain (Fig.1 A). It must be noted thatMMT2 expression was low compared with MRS4. In contrast with known iron regulon genes such as YOR382w (23Protchenko O. Ferea T. Rashford J. Tiedeman J. Brown P.O. Botstein D. Philpott C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49244-49250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar),MRS4 was expressed in ΔAFT1 strains (Fig. 1 B), and moreover, at a higher level than in Aft1+ strains. Recently, DNA microarray experiments have shown that MRS4expression is controlled by another iron regulatory pathway involvingAFT2, a paralogue of AFT1 (24Blaiseau P.L. Lesuisse E. Camadro J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34221-34226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Double and quadruple deletion strains were constructed for MRS3, MRS4,MMT1, and MMT2 genes in wild-type and ΔYFH1 nuclear backgrounds. All strains were viable. However, cellular growth was decreased both in glucose- and glycerol-rich media (Fig.2 A). The slower growth on glucose medium did not result from formation of petite mutants (rho−). This indicates thatMRS3/MRS4 deletions impair cell metabolism not only inside mitochondria but also outside. ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells grew poorly in low iron media containing bathophenantroline sulfonate, an iron chelator (Fig. 2 A). Moreover, optimal growth of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 and ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells on minimum medium was only obtained upon addition of iron in the culture medium (Fig. 2, A and B). The high iron concentration (1 mm) used here inhibits the growth of ΔYFH1 cells, and therefore, the ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 deletion suppresses the iron sensitivity trait characterizing the ΔYFH1 strain. In contrast, after transformation of ΔYFH1 cells with anMRS4-bearing multicopy plasmid these cells were extremely sick, and moreover, had lost their mitochondrial genome. Loss of the mitochondrial DNA was shown by DAPI1 staining experiments (Fig. 3) and in crosses with a rhoo tester strain of opposite mating type, which gave no restoration of growth on glycerol medium (data not shown). These data suggest a link between mitochondrial iron metabolism and Mrs3p/Mrs4p transporters. No growth defect was observed in the ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 strain. Surprisingly, overexpression ofMMT2 suppressed iron sensitivity in ΔYFH1 cells (Fig. 2 C). The quadruple ΔMRS3ΔMRS4ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 deletion strain was not lethal, and its phenotype was identical to that of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strains (data not shown).Figure 3DAPI staining of mitochondrial DNA.Wild-type, ΔYFH1, and ΔYFH1[YEplac195/MRS4] strains grown in glucose-rich medium were suspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 1 μg/ml DAPI and incubated on ice for 10 min. Under these conditions, mitochondrial DNA is preferentially stained. The mitochondrial DNA spots are visible in wild-type and ΔYFH1 cells; nuclei are barely visible. Only the nuclei can be detected inMRS4-overexpressing ΔYFH1 cells. A Leica (DMR) microscope was used with a 340–380-nm band-pass excitation filter, a 400-nm dichroic reflector, and an emission filter at 425 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) If MRS4 and MMT2 genes play a role in the transport of iron into mitochondria, their deletion should alter mitochondrial iron fluxes. Wild-type and mutant cells were radiolabeled with 55Fe for 3 h, and the radioactivity associated with mitochondria and post-mitochondrial supernatant was measured (Fig.4). The iron that accumulates in the mitochondria of ΔYFH1 cells grown in glucose-rich medium cannot be extruded (11Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, defects in iron import into mitochondria should more easily be detected in a ΔYFH1 strain than in a frataxin-containing strain in which the regulation of the balance between uptake and efflux of mitochondrial iron is complex. Mitochondria of glucose-grown ΔYFH1 cells contained 40–45% of the cellular 55Fe compared with 5–10% for wild-type mitochondria (Fig. 4 A). In contrast, the fraction of55Fe present in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 mitochondria was low, close to the level found in wild-type mitochondria (Fig.4 A). These differences were still amplified when cells were cultivated in high iron media (50 μm) (Fig.4 B). Under these conditions, the intracellular55Fe content was similar in wild-type and ΔYFH1 strains. However, in the ΔYFH1 strain iron accumulated in mitochondria to the detriment of the non-mitochondrial fraction. In contrast, in the ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain iron preferentially accumulated in a non-mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 4 B). Conversely, in a rhoo ΔYFH1 strain overproducing Mrs4p, the mitochondrial55Fe content was ∼2.5 times higher than in a rhoo ΔYFH1 strain (Fig. 4 F). The mitochondrial 55Fe content of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells grown either in glucose or glycerol medium was approximately half of that present in the wild-type (Fig. 4, C and E). It must be noted that although intracellular iron concentration was increased in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells compared with wild-type, extra iron was not sent to mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and E). As a consequence, the ratio of the mitochondrial to intracellular iron content decreased from 0.04 in the wild-type to 0.015 in the ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain grown in glucose-rich medium. We also used isolated energized mitochondria to follow the incorporation of 55Fe into protoporphyrin by mitochondrial ferrochelatase in wild-type and MRS4-overexpressing strains. This assay reflects the fraction of iron imported into mitochondria that can be used by the ferrochelatase. A greater fraction of55Fe was recovered in the heme ofMRS4-overexpressing cells (Fig.5). Altogether, these experiments show that loss of the Mrs3p and Mrs4p carriers is a limiting factor for iron import into mitochondria, specifically in ΔYFH1 cells grown in high iron media (Fig.4 B). However, a substantial amount of iron is still imported into mitochondria in the absence of Mrs3p/Mrs4p transporters. Therefore, if Mrs3p/Mrs4p transport iron efficient alternative iron uptake pathways that have yet to be identified are also present.MMT1 and MMT2 deletions had no major effect on mitochondrial iron incorporation and accumulation (Fig. 4,A, B, and E). However, MMT2overexpression in ΔYFH1 cells dramatically decreased the recovery of55Fe in mitochondria (Fig. 4 D), suggesting that Mmt2p does not import iron into mitochondria. Under standard conditions, mitochondrial DNA is stably maintained in our ΔYFH1 strain (9Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). However, non-physiological high iron concentrations induce accumulation of cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA (9Foury F. Cazzalini O. FEBS Lett. 1997; 411: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). No loss of mitochondrial DNA was observed in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells even in the presence of very high iron concentrations (Fig.6 A), in agreement with the observation that iron does not accumulate in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 mitochondria. In contrast, the introduction of ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 deletions in a ΔYFH1 strain elicited significant increase in mitochondrial DNA loss when cells were cultivated in the presence of high iron concentrations (Fig. 6 A). Using Northern blot analysis we have found that mitochondrial DNA loss in ΔYFH1ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 mitochondria did not result from increased expression of the MRS4 gene (data not shown). Similarly,MMT2 was not overexpressed in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4ΔYFH1 cells. We found that the expression of typicalAFT1-dependent genes such as YOR382w,YLR136c, YHL040c, or COT1 was significantly increased in a ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain, although to a lower extent than in a ΔYFH1 strain (Fig. 7). The expression of the iron regulon genes was also higher in a ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain than in a ΔYFH1 strain (data not shown). These data show that the loss of Mrs3p/Mrs4p is associated with activation of the AFT1-dependent regulon, implying that Aft1p encounters low iron concentrations. However, the fraction of 55Fe recovered in the post-mitochondrial supernatant of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 (ΔYFH1) strains is high (Fig.4 C), indicating that this iron species is not perceived by Aft1p. Iron might be sequestered in a specific compartment such as the vacuole (26Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crighton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Li L. Chen O.S. mcvey Wardzz D. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29515-29519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The expression ofAFT1-dependent genes was not increased in ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 cells. Wild-type, ΔYFH1, ΔMRS3ΔMRS4, and ΔYFH1ΔMRS3 ΔMRS4 strains were grown in glycerol-containing medium, and their cytochrome content as well as their aconitase, cytochrome coxidase, and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities were determined. The cytochrome content was not significantly modified in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells (Fig. 8). Cytochrome coxidase and aconitase activities measured in isolated mitochondria were slightly decreased (Fig. 9, Aand D). Therefore, the amount of mitochondrial iron provided by the alternative import pathway was sufficient to ensure a large part of heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis in these cells growing at a slower rate. In ΔYFH1 cells, the cytochrome content was also normal, and cytochrome c oxidase was slightly affected, yet aconitase activity remained substantially lower than in wild-type mitochondria, although the apoprotein concentration estimated by Western blotting analysis was not modified (Fig.9 C). The decline in cytochrome content and in cytochrome oxidase and aconitase activities was more pronounced whenMRS3 and MRS4 deletions were introduced in a ΔYFH1 strain (Figs. 8 and 9). Therefore, in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells the decrease in mitochondrial iron concentration became a severely limiting factor. This indicates that a strain that has no frataxin needs more mitochondrial iron than a wild-type strain for heme and iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis. The mitochondrial oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was similar in all strains (Fig.9 B), suggesting that iron-containing proteins were specifically affected. The deletion of MMT1 andMMT2 genes had no great effect on aconitase activity (Fig.9 A) and heme content (data not shown).Figure 9Mitochondrial enzyme activities in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 and ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 cells. Activities were measured in mitochondria of glycerol-grown cells. Aconitase, cytochrome oxidase, and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activities have been normalized to wild-type activities (100%). Aconitase activity is given as the ratio of aconitase to isocitrate dehydrogenase activity. Standard deviations were estimated using independent cell cultures and mitochondrial preparations.

Ragnini A. Jank B. Teply R. Wiesenberger G. Schweyen R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The latter have defects in magnesium transport into mitochondria (18Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and it has recently been shown that mitochondrial magnesium concentrations are restored to wild-type levels in an mrs2 mutant overexpressingMRS3 or MRS4 (28Gregan J. Kolisek M. Schweyen R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). We did not find significant modifications in the mitochondrial magnesium concentration of strains deleted for MRS3/MRS4 or overexpressingMRS4 (Table I). We also tested the effect of heavy metals on cellular growth. The most striking effect was obtained with cobalt. Growth of wild-type cells was reduced in the presence of 2.5 mm cobalt (Fig.10, lane 1). Inhibition was stronger for ΔYFH1 cells and total for ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 cells (Fig. 10,lanes 2 and 4). In all strains inhibition of cellular growth by cobalt was associated with induction of rho− mutants (Fig. 6). In contrast, ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells were extremely resistant to cobalt (Fig. 10, lane 3), and no loss of mitochondrial DNA was observed in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells. Cells expressing MRS4 on a multicopy plasmid had increased sensitivity to cobalt (Fig. 10, lanes 5 and 6). We were not able to detect cobalt inside mitochondria of wild-type or mutant strains grown in the presence of 25 μm cobalt (Table I). However, cobalt was detected in mitochondria overexpressing Mrs4p (Table I), indicating cobalt accumulation in these mitochondria. Curiously, the cobalt resistant ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain exhibits a higher intracellular cobalt concentration than the wild-type strain (Table I). Since this cobalt is not toxic, it might be sequestered in the vacuole.MRS3/MRS4 deletions were associated with increased cellular sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide and heavy metals such as copper, cadmium, and to a lesser extent, zinc (Fig. 10,lanes 3).Table ICobalt and magnesium concentrations in mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial fractions of wild-type and mutant strainsStrainCobaltMagnesiumMitochondriaSupernatantMitochondriaSupernatant μg Co/mg protein μg Mg/mg proteinWild-type<0.20.72.134ΔMRS3ΔMRS4<0.23.02.234ΔMMT1ΔMMT2<0.20.82.030Wild-type*<0.2NDNDNDWt [MRS4]*0.7NDNDNDCells were cultivated in glucose-rich medium or raffinose minimum medium (*) in the presence of 25 μm cobalt chloride.

On the basis of the capacity ofMRS3/MRS4-overexpressing strains to suppress the mitochondrial magnesium transport defect of mrs2 mutants, it has been proposed that these mitochondrial carriers transport metals. The discovery that MRS4 expression was specifically co-regulated with genes involved in iron mobilization from the external medium and intracellular stores led us to investigate whether Mrs4p mediates iron import into mitochondria. The expression of the AFT1-dependent iron regulon and intracellular iron content are increased in a ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain. Nevertheless, the fraction of iron recovered in mitochondria is ∼2-fold lower in a ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 mutant. Therefore, the extra iron pumped from the external medium by ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells is not perceived by Aft1p and does not enter mitochondria. It might be sequestered in the vacuole, which is an important iron store in yeast (25Rutherford J.C. Jaron S. Ray E. Brown P.O. Winge D.R. Proc. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 14322-14327Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 26Raguzzi F. Lesuisse E. Crighton R.R. FEBS Lett. 1988; 231: 253-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial iron content is a balance between uptake and exit, and therefore, decreased mitochondrial iron uptake in the ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain may be compensated by lower exit so that the final mitochondrial iron content is only modestly decreased. Moreover, the slower growth of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells contributes to maintain mitochondrial iron concentration as constant as possible. Our data indicate that Mrs3p/Mrs4p contribute for approximately half of the mitochondrial iron content. The increase in the incorporation of iron into protoporphyrin IX by ferrochelatase in isolated mitochondria overexpressing Mrs4p suggests in a more direct way that Mrs4p plays a role in mitochondrial iron transport in the wild-type strain. The situation is quite different for ΔYFH1 cells cultivated in glucose-rich medium. The iron regulon is up-regulated even when cells are grown in high iron media, and a large part of the iron imported into the cell is directed to mitochondria. Moreover, no iron is exported from mitochondria (11Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Therefore, the rate of mitochondrial iron uptake is more faithfully reflected in a ΔYFH1 strain. Although the intracellular iron is substantially increased in a ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 strain grown in the presence of 50 μm iron, the mitochondrial iron content is five times lower than in a ΔYFH1 strain. Moreover, although frataxin-deficient cells cultivated in high iron media lose mitochondrial DNA, this effect is completely relieved by MRS3/MRS4 deletions. These data show that iron import into mitochondria is severely limited in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells. Conversely, MRS4 overexpression in ΔYFH1 cells elicits a 2.5-fold additional increase in the mitochondrial iron content. These cells have no mitochondrial DNA even under physiological conditions and grow very poorly, probably as a result of toxic mitochondrial iron overload. Therefore, in ΔYFH1 cells Mrs3p/Mrs4p carriers significantly contribute to mitochondrial iron accumulation. Up-regulation of the MRS4 transcript in the ΔYFH1 strain probably contributes to the process. Altogether, our experiments show that Mrs4p plays a role in mitochondrial iron uptake. This function is shared with at least another transporter that has not yet been identified. This unknown transporter might have high affinity for iron, since mitochondrial iron concentrations are only slightly increased in ΔYFH1ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells grown in high iron media. Reciprocally, Mrs3p and Mrs4p might be low affinity carriers. Increased expression of the iron regulon in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells is associated with increased sensitivity to heavy metals, in particular cadmium and copper. It has been shown that iron starvation is associated with increased expression of broad specificity metal transporters in the plasma membrane (29Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Increased hydrogen peroxide sensitivity of ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells could be explained by the increased oxidative damage produced by heavy metal intracellular overload. However, ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells exhibit an extreme resistance to cobalt. The loss of mitochondrial DNA, which is observed in wild-type and ΔYFH1 strains treated with high cobalt concentrations, is completely prevented by MRS3/MRS4 deletions. Curiously, these cobalt-resistant cells accumulate more cobalt than wild type. This suggests that cobalt is sequestered, perhaps in the vacuole, since the expression of COT1, which encodes a vacuolar cobalt transporter is increased in ΔMRS3ΔMRS4 cells (29Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22181-22187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial cobalt concentration was under detection threshold in wild-type, ΔMRS3ΔMRS4, or ΔYFH1 cells. However, cobalt was detectable in mitochondria of MRS4-overexpressing cells. The latter exhibit increased sensitivity to cobalt. Whether cobalt plays a role in yeast cells, and more specifically in mitochondria, remains obscure. Inhibitory cobalt concentrations are extremely high, and toxicity might result from competition between iron and cobalt in prosthetic groups of iron-containing enzymes, such as ferrochelatase (30Shibayama N. Morimoto H. Kitagawa T. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 331-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). It has previously been found that overexpressed Mrs4p can substitute for Mrs2p, a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in magnesium transport (18Bui D.M. Gregan J. Jarosch E. Ragnini A. Schweyen R.J.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20438-20443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar), suggesting that Mrs4p can also be used for import of magnesium into mitochondria (28Gregan J. Kolisek M. Schweyen R.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Two other transporters in the inner mitochondrial membrane that belong to the family of cation efflux facilitators, Mmt1p and Mmt2p, have also been reported to play a role in mitochondrial iron import (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Moreover, like MRS4, MMT2 is co-regulated with several iron regulon genes. MMT1 and MMT2 were isolated as multicopy suppressors of the growth defect of anerg25 mutant in low iron media (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The authors found that the double deletion mutant grown in low iron media reaches a stationary phase for a lower cell density. Moreover, cells overexpressingMMT1 or MMT2 in high iron (250 μm) media have increased levels of iron both in cytosol and mitochondria. We also found that MMT2 overexpression increases the intracellular iron content, but we did not observe significant change in the mitochondrial iron level. It must be noted, however, that our culture medium contained lower iron concentrations (5–50 μm) to avoid aspecific binding of iron on yeast membranes (6Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Moreover, as previously reported by others (6Lange H. Kispal G. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18989-18996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we did not observe a clear phenotype linked to iron in ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 or ΔYFH1ΔMMT1ΔMMT2 deletion strains. This may be explained by the low expression of these transporters. In contrast to a previous report (4Li L. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28485-28493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), our deletion strains were sensitive to cobalt. Finally, the dramatic decrease in the mitochondrial 55Fe level observed in ΔYFH1 cells overexpressing MMT2 does not support the hypothesis that Mmt2p imports iron into mitochondria but agrees with our observation that MMT2 behaves as a multicopy suppressor of the iron sensitivity trait characterizing ΔYFH1 cells. These data suggest that Mmt1p and Mmt2p play a role in the efflux of iron from mitochondria. It has often been admitted that an increase in toxic free radicals generated by mitochondrial iron overload is a cause of the mitochondrial dysfunction in frataxin-deficient cells (11Radisky D.C. Babcock M.C. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4497-4499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This is probably true in ΔYFH1 cells cultivated in the presence of high non-physiological iron concentrations or when Mrs4p is overexpressed. We also found that ΔYFH1 cells that do not eliminate superoxide anions because they lack Sod2p, the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase, are extremely sick. 2F. Foury, unpublished data. Under these conditions, the mitochondrial genome is destroyed. However, in glycerol-grown ΔYFH1 cells, there is no mitochondrial iron overload, and a specific defect in the activity of iron-sulfur proteins such as aconitase is still observed. Moreover, a decrease in mitochondrial iron concentration is associated with a further decrease in aconitase activity. This means that in a frataxin-deficient strain more iron is required to synthesize iron-sulfur clusters, implying that mitochondrial iron is not efficiently used. This conclusion is in agreement with the report that multimers of yeast frataxin sequester large amounts of iron in a bioavailable form (10Adamec J. Rusnak F. Owen W.G. Naylor S. Benson L.M. Gacy A.M. Isaya G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 67: 549-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), suggesting that frataxin could regulate the delivery of iron for the biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters. A role for frataxin in iron-sulfur cluster metabolism is also supported by data obtained with conditional frataxin-deficient mice showing that a decline in the activity of iron-sulfur cluster proteins occurs prior to mitochondrial iron deposits (32Puccio H. Simon D. Cossee M. Criqui-Filipe P. Tiziano F. Melki J. Hindelang C. Matyas R. Rustin P. Koenig M. Nat. Genet. 2001; 27: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). Moreover, on the basis of phylogenetic studies run on 56 completely sequenced genomes, it has recently been proposed that frataxin plays a role in iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis (33Huynen M.A. Snel B. Bork P. Gibson T.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2001; 10: 2463-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We thus propose that two defective mechanisms co-exist in frataxin deficient cells. First, biosynthesis of iron-sulfur clusters is impaired (34Foury F. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and second, oxidative damage occurs under conditions of excess mitochondrial iron.

They are named for the first letters of the first four proteins in which they were identified: Fablp, YOTB, Vac1p, and early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1).1 A functional role for the FYVE domain was first recognized when it was found to facilitate the localization of EEA1 to endosomes (3Stenmark H.

Thereafter, it has been demonstrated that the FYVE domain specifically binds phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) in vitro (4Gaullier J.M. Simonsen A. D'Arrigo A. Bremnes B. Stenmark H. Aasland R. Nature. 1998; 394: 432-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar,5Patki V. Lawe D.C. Corvera S. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Nature. 1998; 394: 433-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3)P is constitutively present in eukaryotic cells, and the majority of PtdIns(3)P in mammalian cells is produced by class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (6Stenmark H. Gillooly D.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). PtdIns(3)P is thought to be involved in vesicle trafficking as mutations and inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase have caused mis-sorting of vacuolar proteins, changes in vacuole morphology, and defects in the endocytic pathway (7Stack J.H. Horazdovsky B. Emr S.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). As expected from proposed roles of PtdIns(3)P, it has been found in specific subcellular locales, including the cytoplasmic face of early endosomes and internal vesicles of multivesicular bodies (6Stenmark H. Gillooly D.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 12: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Consistent with its in vitro PtdIns(3)P specificity, the FYVE domain has been also shown to be localized to these membrane sitesin vivo (8Komada M. Masaki R. Yamamoto A. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

However, less is known about the mechanism by which FYVE domains interact with and are targeted to PtdIns(3)P-containing membranes. Structural and functional studies have indicated that hydrophobic residues located near the PtdIns(3)P-binding pocket of the FYVE domain partially penetrate the membrane during PtdIns(3)P binding (10Misra S.

It is still unclear, however, whether PtdIns(3)P induces the membrane penetration of the FYVE domain or the PtdIns(3)P binding is a consequence of membrane penetration of the FYVE domain. Questions also remain as to whether the FYVE domain binds to the membrane as a monomer or a dimer and whether lipid-protein interactions alone provide enough driving force for the subcellular targeting of the domain. This study was undertaken to elucidate the membrane-binding mechanism of the FYVE domains of yeast Vps27p andDrosophila hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), with an emphasis on the role of PtdIns(3)P in the membrane binding of the FYVE domain. For this purpose, we measured the membrane binding of wild type and selected mutants of these FYVE domains by surface plasmon resonance and monolayer penetration analyses. We also calculated the electrostatic potentials of the FYVE domains as a function of PtdIns(3)P binding. Results provide new insights into the membrane binding and targeting mechanism of the FYVE domain and the specific role of PtdIns(3)P in the membrane binding of the FYVE domain. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), -phosphoserine (POPS), and -phosphoethanolamine (POPE) were from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL).

GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) beads for protein purification were from Novagen (Madison, WI). Pioneer L1 sensor chip was from Biacore AB (Piscataway, NJ). Mutations of the FYVE domain of Vps27p and Hrs were performed by the overlap extension method (17Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar) using their expression vectors generously provided by Drs. James Hurley and Florante Quiocho, respectively. Gene constructs were subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector containing a GST fusion and thrombin cleavage site and transformed into DH5α cells for plasmid isolation. After checking each construct for correct sequence with DNA sequencing, the plasmid was transformed into BL21 cells for protein expression. 1.5 liters of Luria broth media containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin was inoculated with BL21 cells harboring each respective construct and was incubated at 37 °C until theA 600 nm reached 0.4. At this time, 20 mg of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added along with zinc acetate (final concentration of 50 μm). Cells were then incubated at 25 °C overnight. Cells were harvested for 10 min at 4,000 × g, and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m KCl, 50 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The suspension was sonicated for 15 min using a sequence of 15-s sonication and 45-s cooling on ice. The mixture was centrifuged at 48,000 ×g to separate the soluble and insoluble fractions. The supernatant was filtered into a 50-ml tube, and 1 ml of GST beads was added. This mixture was incubated on ice on a table-top shaker (80 rpm) for 30 min. The mixture was then poured onto a column, which was washed with 20 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1m KCl. The column was subsequently sealed, and 1 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, buffer containing 0.1 mKCl and 0.25 mm CaCl2 along with 2 units of thrombin were added to the column to cleave the GST tag. After 6 h at 25 °C the protein was eluted with 1 ml of 20 mmTris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 m KCl (4 times). Purity of protein was checked on an 18% polyacrylamide gel, and samples were concentrated. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method (Pierce). The FYVE domain of Vps27p was labeled using the reductive methylation method for converting ε-amino groups of lysines to methylamine derivatives (18Jentoft N. Dearborn D.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μl of 0.1 m NaCNBH3 was added to a 1-ml solution containing ∼2 mg of Vps27p-FYVE in 0.05 m HEPES, pH 7.0. After gentle mixing, 1 μCi of [14C]formaldehyde (40–60 mCi/mmol) was added; the solution was mixed and kept at 25 °C for 2 h. The reaction mixture was then dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 m NaCl to remove free unreacted formaldehyde and formaldehyde in labile adducts. The extent of amino group modification was estimated from the known specific activity of [14C]formaldehyde. An average of 10% of 4 lysines in Vps27p-FYVE was labeled by the above method. The labeled protein was then concentrated for further measurements. The penetration of FYVE domains into the phospholipid monolayer was measured by three different methods. First, the change in surface pressure (π) upon protein penetration into the lipid monolayer was measured at constant surface area using a 10-ml circular Teflon trough and Wilhelmy plate connected to a Cahn microbalance as described previously (19Bittova L.

A lipid monolayer containing POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3)P (63:20:15:2) (or other compositions) was spread onto the subphase composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl until the desired initial surface pressure (π0) was reached. After the signal stabilized (∼5 min), 100 μg of FYVE domain was injected, and the change in surface pressure (Δπ) was monitored for 45 min while stirring the subphase at 60 rpm. Typically, the Δπ value reached a maximum after 30 min. The maximal Δπ value depended on the protein concentration and reached a saturation value (e.g. [Vps27p-FYVE] ≥ 8 μg/ml); therefore, protein concentration in the subphase was maintained above such values to ensure that the observed Δπ represented a maximal value. The resulting Δπ was plotted versus π0 from which the critical surface pressure (π c ) was determined as the x intercept. Second, the amount of monolayer-adsorbed protein at a given π0 was measured using the radiolabeled FYVE domain and a hydrophobic Whatman 1PS phase separation filter paper, as described previously (21Momsen W.E. Brockman H.L. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 292-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Papers were cut large enough to cover the trough and washed with chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) (3 times), chloroform (2 times), and finally hexane (2 times) to remove residual surface-active reagents from manufacturing. After the solvents were drained, the papers were dried briefly under N2 and then at 60 °C for 30 min to remove traces of hexane and stored in tightly sealed glass jars until use. Monolayer experiments were then performed in the same manner as described above. When Δπ reached the saturation at a given π0, the monolayer was absorbed onto the filter paper. The paper was then cut into pieces and placed into a scintillation vial for counting radioactivity. Positive control experiments with the [14C]POPC (Amersham Biosciences) monolayer in the absence of protein in the subphase showed that an average of 50% of the monolayer could be recovered by this method. Also, negative control experiments with 35S-ATP (AmershamBiosciences) in the subphase showed that less than 3% of total radioactivity was taken from the subphase. Thus, the surface concentration of monolayer-bound protein was estimated by dividing the moles of protein (calculated from the twice of total surface radioactivity and the specific activity of labeled protein) by the surface area of the trough. Finally, the change in surface area of the monolayer induced by Vps27p-FYVE was measured at constant surface pressure using a NIMA Langmuir-Blodgett surface film balance with two movable surface barriers. For these experiments, an appropriate amount of lipid monolayer (POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3)P (63:20:15:2) or POPC/POPE/POPS (65:20:15)) was spread onto the subphase (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl, 40 ml total volume) to reach a desired initial surface area (∼30 cm2) at a given π0 (23 dyne/cm). Then, Vps27p-FYVE (about 400 μg) was injected into the subphase sequentially until the change in surface area reached a plateau. A detailed protocol for coating the L1 sensor chip has been described elsewhere (22Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4218-4226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 23Stahelin R.V. Cho W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 4672-4678Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Briefly, after washing the sensor chip surface, 90 μl of vesicles containing POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3)P (63:20:15:2) were injected at 5 μl/min to give a response of 2400 RU. Similarly, a control surface was coated with POPC/POPE/POPS (65:20:15) vesicles to give the same RU response as the active binding surface. This control surface was selected over the bare chip surface to circumvent any potential artifacts caused by the hydrophobic nature of the L1 chip. Under our experimental conditions no binding was detected to this surface beyond the refractive index change for Vps27p-FYVE or Hrs-FYVE. Each lipid layer was stabilized by injecting 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH 3 times at 100 μl/min, which showed no decrease in lipid signal after the second injection. The coating efficiency of each surface was tested using a 25-μl injection of 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The BSA response was between 100–200 RU compared with 1200 RU of BSA for an uncoated chip surface. In control experiments, the fluorescence intensity of the flow buffer after rinsing the sensor chip coated with POPC/POPE/POPS (65:20:15) or POPC/POPE/POPS/PtdIns(3)P (63:20:15:2) vesicles incorporated with 10 mm 5-carboxylfuorescein (Amersham Biosciences) was monitored to confirm vesicles remained intact on the L1 chip. After stabilization of signal (i.e. ≤0.3 RU/min drift), experiments were done at 30 μl/min. Ninety μl of protein in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl was injected to give an association time of 180 s, whereas the dissociation was monitored for 300 s or longer depending on the rate of the dissociation. The lipid surface could be regenerated using 10 μl of 50 mm NaOH demonstrating the specific and reversible nature of the vesicle-protein binding. After sensorgrams were obtained for 5 or more concentrations of each protein, each of them was corrected for refractive index change by subtracting the control surface response from it. The association and dissociation phases of all sensorgrams were globally fit to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model: protein + (protein-binding site on the vesicle) ↔ (complex) using BIAevaluation 3.0 software (Biacore). The association phase was analyzed using an equation, R = (k a C/(k a C + k d ))R max(1 − e−(ka C+kd )(t−t 0)) + RI, where RI is the refractive index change;R max is the theoretical binding capacity;C is the protein concentration; k a is the association rate constant; and t 0 is the initial time. The dissociation phase was analyzed using an equation,R =R 0e−(kd (t−t 0), where k d is the dissociation rate constant, andR 0 is the initial response. The dissociation constant (K d ) was then calculated from the equation,K d = k d /k a . It should be noted that in our SPR analysis K d is defined in terms of not the molarity of phospholipids but the molarity of protein-binding sites on the vesicle. Thus, if each protein-binding site on the vesicle is composed of n lipids,nK d is the dissociation constant in terms of molarity of lipid monomer (see below) (20Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Due to difficulty involved in accurate determination of the concentration of lipids coated on the sensor chip, however, only K d was determined in our SPR analysis, and the relative affinity was calculated as a ratio ofK d values assuming that n values are essentially the same for wild type and mutants. Mass transport (24Schuck P. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 541-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 25Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) was not a limiting factor in our experiments, as change in flow rate did not affect kinetics of association and dissociation. To validate the K d values calculated from kinetic SPR analysis, we also determined the K d value for Vps27p-FYVE from equilibrium binding measurements. For these measurements, the flow rate was reduced to 5 μl/min to allow sufficient time for the association phase, which in turn allowsR values to reach saturating response values (R eq). R eq values were then plotted versus protein concentrations (C), and the K d value was determined by a nonlinear least squares analysis of the binding isotherm using an equation,R eq = R max/(1 +K d /C). The binding of Vps27p-FYVE to phospholipids was measured by a centrifugation assay using phospholipid-coated hydrophobic styrene-divinylbenzene beads (20Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar,26Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The beads were coated with POPC/POPS/POPE/PtdIns(3)P (63:15:20:2) as described previously (26Kim Y. Lichtenbergova L. Snitko Y. Cho W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 250: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The concentration of phospholipids coated on beads was determined by measuring the radioactivity of a trace of [14C]POPC (0.1 mol%) included in the phospholipid mixture. The bulk phospholipid concentration was typically 1 μm. Binding mixtures contained a fixed concentration of phospholipid-coated beads in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl, 1 μm BSA, and varying concentrations of radiolabeled (by reductive methylation; see above) Vps27p-FYVE (10–400 nm). BSA was added to minimize the loss of protein due to nonspecific adsorption to tube walls. After the mixtures were incubated for 15 min, beads were pelleted (12,000 ×g for 2 min), and the free protein amount was determined by scintillation counting. Parameters n andK d were determined by nonlinear least squares analysis of the bound ([P] b ) versustotal protein concentration ([P]0) plot using a standard binding Equation 1 (20Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), [P]b=[P]o+Kd+[PL]o/n−([P]o+Kd+[PL]o/n)2−4[P]o[PL]o/n2Equation 1 where [PL] o represents total phospholipid concentration. Equation 1 assumes that each enzyme binds independently to a site on the interface composed of n phospholipids with dissociation constant of K d . The electrostatic properties of the FYVE domains with and without IP2 were calculated and visualized in the program GRASP (27Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5316) Google Scholar), as described previously (28Murray D. Honig B. Mol.

In the panels of Fig. 8, the electrostatic potentials are represented by two-dimensional equipotential contours in 0.1 m KCl: red, −25 mV; gray, +6 mV;magenta, +12 mV; blue, +25 mV; deep purple, +50 mV. GRASP calculations performed either with formal charges or partial charges taken from the CHARMM27 force-field (31Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J.

The spatial coordinates for Vps27p-FYVE were taken from the structure solved by Misra and Hurley (10Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1VFY) and those for Hrs-FYVE from the structure solved by Mao et al. (11Mao Y.

Cell. 2000; 100: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1DVP, residues 154–230). The coordinates for the head group of PtdIns(3)P and IP2, were taken from the structure of EEA1-FYVE (12Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1HYI). IP2 was docked onto Vps27p-FYVE and Hrs-FYVE through structural superposition (32Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar) with the IP2-bound EEA1 FYVE domain. Although the partial penetration of hydrophobic residues into the membrane has been implicated in the PtdIns(3)P-dependent membrane binding of FYVE domain, it remains unclear whether PtdIns(3)P induces the membrane penetration of the FYVE domain or the PtdIns(3)P binding is a consequence of membrane penetration of the FYVE domain. To determine the exact role of PtdIns(3)P in membrane binding of FYVE domain, we employed various monolayer techniques that serve as a highly sensitive tool to measure the membrane penetrating ability of protein (20Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). First, a POPC/POPE/POPS (65:20:15 in mole ratio) monolayer, which simulates the lipid composition of early endosomes (34Kobayashi T. Stang E. Fang K.S. de Moerloose P. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. Nature. 1998; 392: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), of a given π0was spread at constant area, and Δπ was monitored after the injection of the protein into the subphase. In general, Δπ is inversely proportional to π0 of the phospholipid monolayer, and an extrapolation of the Δπ versusπ0 plot yields π c which specifies an upper limit of π0 of a monolayer that a protein can penetrate (20Cho W. Bittova L. Stahelin R.V. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 296: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 33Verger R. Pattus F. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1982; 30: 189-227Crossref Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows that the FYVE domains of Vps27p and Hrs have relatively low monolayer penetrating power in the absence of PtdIns(3)P with π c values around 20 dyne/cm. This indicates that the two FYVE domains do not have high intrinsic membrane penetrating capability. However, PtdIns(3)P in the monolayer greatly enhanced the monolayer penetration of both FYVE domains, raising π c values to 29–30 dyne/cm at 2 mol % and to 33–34 dyne/cm at 4 mol %, respectively. The specific nature of the PtdIns(3)P effect was evident when the monolayer penetration was measured in the presence of a nonspecific isomer, PtdIns(5)P; it had no significant effect on the monolayer penetration of Vps27p-FYVE and Hrs-FYVE. The data thus indicate that the role of PtdIns(3)P is to induce specifically the membrane penetration of the FYVE domain. To corroborate this notion, we measured the monolayer penetration of selected mutants of Vps27p and Hrs FYVE domains. We first mutated the arginine residues (Arg193 for Vps27p and Arg181for Hrs) essential for specific recognition of the 3-phosphate group in PtdIns(3)P (13Dumas J.J. Merithew E. Sudharshan E. Rajamani D. Hayes S. Lawe D. Corvera S. Lambright D.G. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 947-958Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). We also mutated hydrophobic (Leu185 and Leu186 for Vps27p and Phe173 for Hrs) and basic (Lys181 and Lys182 for Vps27p and Arg168 for Hrs) residues (see Fig. 8) that are not directly involved in specific PtdIns(3)P binding but have been implicated in membrane interactions (10Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). As illustrated in Fig.2, the R193A mutant of Vps27p-FYVE exhibited low monolayer penetration regardless of the presence of PtdIns(3)P in the monolayer, supporting that PtdIns(3)P binding induces the membrane penetration of the FYVE domain. Similarly, L185A/L186A of Vps27p-FYVE had low monolayer penetration both with and without PtdIns(3)P in the monolayer, confirming the previous reports (10Misra S. Hurley J.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 657-666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 12Kutateladze T. Overduin M. Science. 2001; 291: 1793-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) that these two Leu residues are involved in partial membrane penetration. However, the mutation of surface lysines (Lys181 and Lys182) to Ala had only a slight effect on the monolayer penetration of Vps27p-FYVE. The corresponding mutations of Hrs-FYVE had similar effects (see Fig.3), i.e. large reduction in monolayer penetrating power by R181A and F173A mutations and smaller effects by R168A mutation. For this protein, we also mutated a conserved Phe (Phe171) located near Phe173 to Ala. A close examination of crystal and solution structures of FYVE domains (10Misra S. Hurley J.H.

Molecular cloning and electrophysiological studies have shown that the presence of various K+ currents in mammalian cells is primarily attributable to the expression of multiple channel subunit genes that encode channels with distinct electrical properties. Kv4 channel genes (Kv4.1, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3) encode channels that are activated at subthreshold of action potentials and rapidly inactivate (1Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Immunohistochemical studies show somatodendritic localization of Kv4 channel proteins (7Maletic-Savatic M. Lenn N.J. Trimmer J.S. J.

This current influences action potential propagation and frequency (10Magee J. Hoffman D. Colbert C. Johnston D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 327-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In cardiac myocytes, transient outward K+ current is important for the early phase of repolarization and sets distinct action potential waveforms in different regions of the heart. Thus, Kv4 channels play crucial roles in integrating synaptic inputs and setting the shape and frequency of action potentials in neurons and cardiac myocytes. Recent molecular genetic studies revealed that many K+channels are composed of not only their pore-forming subunits but are associated with various auxiliary subunits and/or other interacting proteins. The expression and localization of Kv4 channels can be regulated by various channel-interacting proteins including Kvβ subunits (11Nakahira K. Shi G. Rhodes K.J. Trimmer J.S. J. Biol.

These findings indicate that KChIPs are essential components of these rapidly inactivating K+ channels in excitable cells. Although it is clear that KChIPs are present in association with Kv4 channels to regulate their expression and gating in vivo, some or all KChIPs may also act as transcription factors and regulators of the Alzheimer's disease-associated proteins presenilins. KChIP3 has been shown to inhibit transcription of the prodynorphine gene by interacting with the DNA element in its 5′-untranslated region in an intracellular Ca2+ concentration-dependent manner and therefore was named downstream regulatory element-antagonist modulator (DREAM) (25Carrion A.M. Link W.A. Ledo F. Mellstrom B. Naranjo J.R. Nature. 1999; 398: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). KChIP3 is also known as calsenilin, because this protein was shown to interact with the C terminus of the Alzheimer's disease-associated presenilins (26Buxbaum J.D. Choi E.K. Luo Y. Lilliehook C. Crowley A.C. Merriam D.E. Wasco W. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1177-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Thus, KChIP3, as well as other KChIPs, may participate in multiple cellular responses. To elucidate how KChIPs regulate Kv4 channels and other cellular processes, we isolated cDNAs for various KChIP gene products. In this paper, we show that KChIP2 splicing isoforms influence Kv4.3 channel gating in a similar manner but exhibit differential enhancement of channel expression and subcellular localization. These differences appear to be primarily due to palmitoylation of the N-terminal peptide which is present only in the longer isoforms. Palmitoylation of KChIP3 at the corresponding sites is similarly required for efficient plasma membrane localization and up-regulation of functional channel expression. These results indicate that palmitoylation is an important mechanism to control the subcellular localization of complexes containing these potentially multifunctional Ca2+-binding proteins. Rat KChIP2 cDNAs were obtained using RT-PCR with primers that were designed based on the published human KChIP2 sequence (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNAs were prepared with total RNA isolated from whole brain and heart of female adult (∼9 weeks old) Sprague-Dawley rats using thermoscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR with one set of primers (the 5′ end primer, 5′-ATGCGGGGCCAGGGCCGCAAGGA-3′; the 3′ end primer, 5′-CTAGATGTCATTGTCAAAGAGCTCCAT-3′) generated clear multiple products in the molecular size range expected from the human sequence. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM T-vector Easy (Promega). The obtained clones were classified into three groups due to restriction enzyme digestion patterns. At least four clones from each group were sequenced. KChIP2 cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) and Emerald-C1 using NcoI and SalI sites in the polylinker region of pGEM T-vector Easy. Emerald-C1 vector was constructed by replacing EGFP of EGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) with Emerald (Packard Instrument Co.) by a PCR-based method. Briefly, KChIP2 cDNA clones were digested withNcoI, blunt-ended with Klenow, and cut with SalI. The obtained fragments were subcloned into blunt-endedEcoRI-XhoI site of pcDNA3 and blunt-endedHindIII-SalI site of Emerald-C1. The resulting Emerald constructs contain a 17-amino acid peptide with the sequence SGLRSRAQAHGGRGNSI between Emerald and KChIP. Myc-tagged Kv4.3 cDNA was constructed by introducing an EcoRI site in front of the initiation methionine of Kv4.3 using site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), followed by subcloning a full-length Kv4.3 cDNA intoEcoRI-XbaI site of pCS2+MT. The obtained construct contains six Myc tags at the N terminus of the Kv4.3 polypeptide. Total RNA was isolated using one-step extraction with acid phenol chloroform guanidium thiocyanate, and RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically. First strand cDNAs were prepared from the isolated total RNA with an oligo(dT)18 primer using thermostable reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). PCR for KChIP2 splicing variants was performed with oligonucleotides (5′-GCTCCTATGACCAGCTTACGG-3′ and 5′-CCTCGTTGACAATCCCACTGG-3′) as follows: 94 °C for 15 s, 64 °C for 15 s, and 68 °C for 1.5 min + 10 s/cycle for 22 cycles and that for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was done with primers (5′-GCCATCACTGCCACTCAG-3′ and 5′-GTGAGCTTCCCGTTCAGC-3′) for 14 cycles. Obtained products were separated on an 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells on an 100-mm plastic dish were transfected with Myc-tagged Kv4.3 cDNA (2 μg), KChIP2 cDNA, or empty vector (10 μg) and Emerald-C1 (0.5 μg) using LipofectAMINE-PLUS (Invitrogen). Immediately after transfection, cells were passed using trypsin/EDTA solution into 60-mm plastic dishes at various densities. Various days after transfection, cells were harvested with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Cell extract was prepared with modified RIPA buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.2% SDS, 1 mm iodoacetamide, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl oxide, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)). Protein concentration was determined by modified Lowry method (Invitrogen) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblot analysis was performed following SDS-PAGE with polyclonal anti-Myc, anti-GFP (MBL International), or anti-KChIP2 antibodies as described previously (12Yang E.K. Alvira M.R. Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Anti-KChIP2 antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide containing the first 25 amino acids of the protein and was affinity-purified. Chemiluminescent images were captured and analyzed using a CCD camera-based system (Ultraviolet Products). CHO cells on a 35-mm plastic dish were transfected with expression constructs for Kv4.3 (0.05 μg), KChIP2, or empty vector (0.25 μg) and Emerald-C1 (0.05 μg). The EGFP construct was included for identification of transfected cells. Two days after transfection, whole-cell voltage clamp recording was performed with an EPC-9 patch clamp amplifier using the Pulse program (HEKA) or with Axopatch-1D patch clamp amplifier using pClamp software. Pipettes were filled with a solution containing 140 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Bath solution contained 155 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 20 mm glucose, and 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.4). Leak currents were subtracted by P/4 protocol, and series resistance was set at 70%. Peak currents were converted into conductance (G) by the formula G = I/(Vm −Vrev), where I is the measured membrane current,Vm is the voltage step, andVrev is the potassium reversal potential, which was calculated to be −84 mV. For activation and steady state inactivation analyses, the half-maximal voltage (V12) and the slope factor (k) were acquired using the modified Boltzmann equationG/Gmax = 1/(1 + exp(V12 − V)/k), whereG is the conductance; Gmax is the fitted maximal conductance, and V is the command potential. For recovery from inactivation, the data were fitted with one and two exponentials, and fitness was evaluated by F test using the Prism program (GraphPad). In all the cases, the data were better described with one exponential, and constants were obtained using these equations. One day after transfection, CHO cells on a 100-mm dish transfected with Kv4.3 and GFP-KChIP cDNAs (5:1 cDNA ratio) were metabolically labeled with 1 mCi of [3H]palmitic acid in the standard medium supplemented with extra sodium pyruvate (200 mg/liter) for 4 h. Cell extracts were prepared, and immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-GFP antibody, as described previously (12Yang E.K. Alvira M.R. Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Takimoto K. Levitan E.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14149-14156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), except that the solutions for binding and washing were done with the modified RIPA buffer. Precipitated materials were separated on a 10% SDS gel and subjected to fluorographic exposure. A small portion of the precipitates was used for immunoblotting with anti-GFP antibody. HEK293 cells on a polylysine-coated glass coverslip in a 35-mm plastic dish were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation with Emerald-KChIP2 expression vector (0.05 μg) and Kv4.3 cDNA expression construct or empty vector (0.25 μg) for GFP imaging, or with myc-Kv4.3 cDNA (0.1 μg) and KChIP2 pcDNA or empty vector (0.5 μg) for immunostaining. Two days after transfection, confocal images were taken directly (GFP imaging) or following immunostaining on anAmersham Biosciences 2001 scanning laser microscope as described previously (12Yang E.K. Alvira M.R. Levitan E.S. Takimoto K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 4839-4844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For immunostaining, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Cell dishes were coated with 5% nonfat-dry milk in the same solution and probed with Cy3-conjugated anti-Myc antibody. Plasma membrane or surface expression was evaluated by comparing location of fluorescence with bright field images of cells. Statistical analysis was carried out using Mann-Whitney two-tailed test, and p < 0.05 was considered to be significant. All the data in this work are presented as means ± S.E. To obtain rat KChIP2 cDNAs, we performed RT-PCR with primers that were designed based on the published human sequence (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). PCR with one set of primers using RNAs from adult rat brain or heart as starting materials produced multiple fragments in the expected molecular size range. Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed the presence of three rat KChIP2 splicing isoforms (Fig.1A). The longest isoform contains an additional 32-amino acid peptide not present in the human sequence, whereas the shortest variant lacks an 18-amino acid peptide. The identical KChIP2 isoforms have recently been isolated from several species (20Bahring R. Dannenberg J. Peters H.C. Leicher T. Pongs O. Isbrandt D. J. Biol.

Commun. 2001; 282: 96-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We named these long, medium, and short isoforms KChIP2a, -2b, and -2c, respectively. Rat KChIP2b shows ∼97% amino acid identity to its human counterpart. Previous work (16An W.F. Bowlby M.R. Betty M. Cao J. Ling H.P. Mendoza G. Hinson J.W. Mattsson K.I. Strassle B.W. Trimmer J.S. Rhodes K.J. Nature. 2000; 403: 553-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar) has shown that KChIP2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in rat brain and heart. High levels of Kv4 channel mRNAs and proteins have also been found in these two organs (1Baldwin T.J. Tsaur M.L. Lopez G.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Neuron. 1991; 7: 471-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 29Tsaur M.L. Chou C.C. Shih Y.H. Wang H.L. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 30Serodio P. Rudy B. J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 79: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). To test for differential expression of the identified KChIP2 splicing isoforms in various regions of these two organs, we used RT-PCR with primers that correspond to the common N-terminal and core regions of the rat KChIP2 sequence (Fig. 1B). In brain, KChIP2 mRNA was abundant in striatum, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, was moderate in cerebral cortex, and was low in thalamus and hypothalamus. No significant PCR product for any KChIP2 variants was detected in pituitary or skeletal muscle (data not shown) even after extended cycles (40 cycles). In cerebral cortex, striatum, and hippocampus, the longest KChIP2a seemed a predominant form, whereas all three isoforms were equally expressed in the olfactory bulb. Unlike region-selective expression in the brain, the auxiliary subunit mRNAs were abundant throughout the heart tissues. Specifically, no differential expression of any KChIP2 isoform mRNA was found between the right and left ventricles or across the left ventricular wall. In contrast to the abundant expression of the longest variant in the brain, the two shorter isoforms, KChIP2b and -2c, predominated in these tissues. Thus, KChIP2 splicing isoforms are differentially expressed in brain and heart tissues. Many auxiliary subunits or interacting proteins for K+ channels increase current density and/or channel protein levels. To test whether the identified KChIP2 splicing variants might differentially influence the expression of Kv4 channels, we first measured Kv4.3 channel protein levels upon coexpression of each splicing isoform (Kv4.3:KChIP = 1:5) in CHO cells (Fig.2, A and B). All KChIP2 splicing variants significantly increased Kv4.3 protein levels. KChIP2a and -2b produced significantly larger increases (∼3-fold) than KChIP2c (∼1.6-fold). These fold increases in channel protein level were similar between 1 and 4 days after transfection. KChIP protein levels detected with antibody raised against the first 25 amino acids of the rat KChIP2 peptide were similar for all variants (within 25% of deviations in all experiments, data not shown). Furthermore, increasing amounts of KChIP2c (Kv4.3:KChIP = 1:10) did not cause further enhancement (data not shown). Thus, the two isoforms with a longer N terminus more potently facilitate the expression of Kv4.3 channel proteins. Next we examined if the observed increases in channel protein level were correlated with functional channel expression (Fig. 2,C and D). Similar to the effects on channel protein level, patch clamp recording revealed that the two longer isoforms produced larger increases in Kv4.3 current density than the shortest variant. Coexpression of excess KChIP2a, -2b, and -2c (Kv4.3:KChIP2 cDNA ratio = 1:5) resulted in ∼4.0-, ∼3.2-, and ∼1.6-fold increases in current density, respectively. Thus, the two longer KChIP2 variants more effectively enhanced the expression of functional Kv4.3 channels than the shortest isoform. In contrast to the differential increases in functional channel expression, the three variants similarly influenced the gating of associated Kv4.3 channels (Fig. 3 and Table I). Coexpression of any KChIP2 splicing variants resulted in significantly slower inactivation with test pulses at higher voltages (Fig.3B). Likewise, all three isoforms caused significantly faster and more complete recovery from inactivation (Fig.3D). The only notable difference among the KChIP2 variant-induced changes in Kv4.3 channel gating was that KChIP2a, but not other two isoforms, produced a marginal shift to the left in the voltage dependence of activation (Fig. 3A). Thus, the three KChIP2 splicing isoforms produce similar changes in Kv4.3 channel gating in transfected CHO cells. These results indicate that the observed differential enhancement of current density by the splicing variants is not due to altered Kv4.3 channel gating but to the number or conductance of functional channels. Taken together with the differential increases in channel protein level, we concluded that the two longer KChIP2 isoforms more potently enhance functional Kv4.3 channel expression by producing larger increases in the number of functional channels at the cell surface.Table ISummary of KChIP2 variant-induced changes in Kv4.3 channel gatingActivationInactivationRecovery from inactivation, time constantHalf-maximal activationSlope factorTime constant at 50 mVHalf-maximal inactivationSlope factormVmsmVmsNone12.0 ± 0.215.6 ± 0.233.3 ± 2.7−47.7 ± 0.6−5.8 ± 0.5175 ± 12(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 5)KChIP2a6.5 ± 0.21-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.15.8 ± 0.254.4 ± 2.11-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.−48.4 ± 0.3−3.9 ± 0.31-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.75.7 ± 11.71-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 4)KChIP2b11.9 ± 0.215.5 ± 0.251.2 ± 5.11-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.−49.9 ± 0.4−4.7 ± 0.476.2 ± 8.01-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 7)(n = 7)(n = 5)KChIP2c12.6 ± 0.215.2 ± 0.247.5 ± 7.81-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.−50.6 ± 0.6−5.4 ± 0.691.3 ± 11.91-aValues are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None.(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 6)(n = 8)(n = 8)(n = 4)Parameters were obtained with the data presented in Fig. 3 using one exponential in all the cases.1-a Values are significantly different (p < 0.05) compared with None. Open table in a new tab Parameters were obtained with the data presented in Fig. 3 using one exponential in all the cases. Because the KChIP2 splicing variants differentially increased the expression of functional Kv4.3 channels, we wondered if these isoforms might differ in their ability to control channel protein trafficking. To address this question, we first examined subcellular localization of KChIP2 variants by using GFP as a tag. Because the flat shape of CHO cells makes the detection of the cell surface localization of proteins difficult, we used HEK293 cells for this purpose. GFP-tagged KChIPs were expressed in HEK293 cells in the presence or absence of Kv4.3 proteins (Fig.4A). Even in the absence of Kv4.3 proteins, significant GFP-KChIP2a and -2b were found at the plasma membrane, and weak fluorescence was seen throughout the cell. Expression of excess Kv4.3 proteins intensified the fluorescence of these GFP-tagged subunits at the plasma membrane, and less diffuse fluorescence was observed inside the cell. In contrast, no significant plasma membrane fluorescence was detected with GFP-KChIP2c in the absence of Kv4.3 protein. Coexpression with Kv4.3 proteins localized GFP-KChIP2c to the plasma membrane and other intracellular compartments. Compared with the two longer isoform fusion proteins, more intracellular accumulation was evident with GFP-KChIP2c. Thus, KChIP2a and -2b, but not -2c, have the ability to localize to the plasma membrane without coexpression of Kv4.3 channels. This ability may contribute to the observed larger increases in the expression of functional Kv4.3 channels. Next we tested if the KChIP2 splicing variants might differentially localize their associated channels at the plasma membrane by using immunostaining with Myc-tagged Kv4.3 proteins (Fig. 4B). In the absence of any KChIP2 variant, Kv4.3 proteins were rather diffusely distributed throughout the cell, and only a few cells (<5%) exhibited clear cell surface localization. When excess KChIP2a or -2b was coexpressed, the channel proteins were found at the cell surface in the majority of transfected cells. In contrast, less apparent surface localization of the channel protein was seen with KChIP2c. These results indicate that the two longer KChIP2 isoforms more effectively localize associated channels to the plasma membrane than the shortest variant. Because KChIP2a and -2b, but not KChIP2c, were effective in localizing themselves and their associated channels at the plasma membrane, the 32-amino acid peptide that is present in the two longer isoforms might be responsible for the observed differences. This peptide exhibits similarity to a part of the C-terminal region of the G protein-coupled receptor kinase GRK6 (Fig.5A, top). The cysteine residues in this part of the kinase are known to be palmitoylated (31Stoffel R.H. Randall R.R. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Inglese J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27791-27794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the KChIP2 isoforms, we also detected potential palmitoylation sites in the N-terminal regions of KChIP3 and the longer isoform of KChIP4 (17Rosati B. Pan Z. Lypen S. Wang H.S.

It has been reported that the rate of NO reaction with oxyhemoglobin (Hb) within RBCs is nearly three orders of magnitude slower than that by equal amounts of free oxyhemoglobin. Consistent with early studies on oxygen uptake by RBCs, the process of extracellular diffusion was reported to explain this much lower NO uptake by RBC encapsulated Hb (Liu, X., Miller, M. J., Joshi, M. S., Sadowska-Krowicka, H., Clark, D. A., and Lancaster, J. R., Jr. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 18709–18713). However, it was subsequently proposed that the RBC membrane provides the main resistance to NO uptake rather than the process of extracellular diffusion (Vaughn, M. W., Huang, K. T., Kuo, L., and Liao, J. C. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 2342–2348). This conclusion was based on competition experiments that were assumed to be able to determine the rate constant of NO uptake by RBCs without extracelluar diffusion limitation. To test the validity of this hypothesis, we theoretically analyzed competition experiments. Here, we show that competition experiments do not eliminate the extracellular diffusion limitation. Simulation of the competition data indicates that the main resistance to NO uptake by RBCs is caused by extracellular diffusion in the unstirred layer surrounding each RBC but not by the RBC membrane. This extracellular diffusion resistance is responsible for preventing interference of NO signaling in the endothelium without the need for special NO uptake by intracellular hemoglobin or a unique membrane resistance mechanism.

Collier J. Moncada S. Lancet. 1989; 2: 997-1000Abstract PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). It is generated in vascular endothelium by a specific arginine-dependent NO synthase, NOS3. Free diffusion has been considered to be the main process that determines how NO travels from the site of its formation to target sites where it exerts its critical physiological functions (2Lancaster J.R., Jr. Proc.

In the vascular lumen NO can be scavenged by hemoglobin subunits (Hb)1 within RBCs. The reaction of NO with myoglobin and hemoglobin is rapid (bimolecular rate constant for oxyMb is k Mb = 3 × 107m−1 s−1 and for oxyHb is k Hb = 6–9 × 107m−1 s−1) (4Eich R.F., Li, T. Lemon D.D.

The rapid reaction between NO and oxyhemoglobin raises the question of how NO can escape from the large quantity of Hb in the blood vessel lumen to exert physiological effects in the blood vessel wall after it is generated from endothelial cells (2Lancaster J.R., Jr. Proc.

Based on a diffusion-limited reaction model where the limiting step for NO reaction with RBC-enclosed Hb is diffusion of NO from the solution to the surface of RBCs, it was found that the calculated rate constant for the reaction between NO and RBC Hb is very close to that experimentally determined with direct electrochemical measurements. Recently, these experimental results were verified in competition experiments comparing the scavenging of NO by free Hb to that of RBC-enclosed Hb (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar); however, it was concluded that the RBC membrane is the main resistance to NO transfer into RBCs. This was based on the following competition Equation 1, which was derived under the assumption that much of extracellular diffusion resistance is eliminated in competition experiments because NO is uniformly generated in extracellular solution, and a high hematocrit (>5%) was used in the experiments (13Vaughn M.W.

[metHb] ex is measured experimentally and then the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb is determined from Equation 1 using these experimental data. It was found that the ratio of k RBC/k Hb has a large increase as hematocrit changes from 1.6 to 5%, and then the ratio slightly increases as hematocrit changes from 5 to 16%. The large increase of k RBC as hematocrit changes from 1.6 to 5% was attributed to the diminution of extracellular diffusion resistance, and therefore the value ofk RBC, measured in the high hematocrit region, was considered to be caused only by RBC membrane resistance. The controversy about the resistance of RBCs to NO transfer is analogous to that relating to explanations for RBC oxygen uptake. More than 70 years ago, it was discovered that RBC oxygen uptake was considerably slower than that of an equivalent concentration of free Hb (15Hartridge H. Roughton F.J.W. J. Physiol. 1927; 62 (.,): 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Early investigators suggested that oxygen uptake by RBCs is limited mainly by the transport of oxygen across the RBC membrane and intracellular diffusion of oxygen based on the assumption that extracellular oxygen gradients are not present in rapid mixing devices (16Nicholson P. Roughton F.J.W. Proc. R. Soc. B. 1951; 138: 241-264PubMed Google Scholar, 17Holland R.A. Respir. Physiol. 1967; 3: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, it is now accepted that effective diffusion layers around RBCs still exist in rapid mixing devices (18Coin J.T. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1178-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Rice S.A. Biophys.

Olson J.S Biophys. J. 1984; 45: 825-835Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since the assumption of competition experiments was not based on strict theoretical analysis, one may ask the following two questions. 1) Is NO concentration really uniformly distributed in solution in the competition experiments? 2) Does the value ofk RBC at high hematocrit (from 5 to 16%) really represent the rate constant of transmembrane diffusion? To answer the two questions, we have theoretically analyzed competition experiments in this study. NO concentration, NO flux at RBC membrane, the formation rate of extracellular metHb, and the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb are calculated and shown at different membrane permeabilities (Pm) and hematocrits (Hct). Our results show that NO concentration is not uniform in solution in competition experiments. Computer simulation of competition data indicates that RBC NO uptake is primarily limited by the extracellular diffusion resistance rather than the RBC membrane resistance. The disc shape of RBC is replaced with a spherical shape for simplifying the theoretical analysis. The effective radius of the spherical RBC, r0, is determined from the surface area of the disc shape (14Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5 (.,): 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this model, the spherical RBC is fixed at the center of a limited spherical volume or container with a radius r1. The radius of the container is defined by the hematocrit as the ratio of the RBC volume to the container volume, r03/ r13. For the competition experiments, the RBC is surrounded with Hb solution that fills the space between the surface of the RBC and the inner wall of the container (Fig. 1). After adding an NO donor to the extracellular Hb solution, the donor uniformly distributes in the whole extracellular solution. NO released from the donor either reacts with Hb in the extracellular solution to form metHb or transfers into the RBC. NO that enters into the RBC is immediately scavenged by the concentrated intracellular Hb so that NO concentration inside the RBC is maintained very close to zero. Since NO is slowly released from the NO donor and extracellular Hb concentration is much greater than NO concentration in competition experiments, the extracellular Hb can be considered to be homogeneously distributed in the solution. With these assumptions we have analytically derived expressions to predict extracellular NO concentration, NO flux at the RBC membrane, the formation rate of extracellular metHb, and the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb. Based on the above assumptions, the following diffusion-reaction equation and boundary conditions (Equations Equation 2, Equation 3, Equation 4) are used to describe the competition experiment for any hematocrit (from 0 to 100%), DNO1r2ddrr2d[NO]dr+k1[A]−kHb[Hb]ex[NO]=0Equation 2 DNOd[NO]/dr=Pm[NO]matr=r0Equation 3 d[NO]/dr=0atr=r1Equation 4 where DNO is the diffusion constant of NO in the extracellular solution; Pm is membrane permeability;k 1, k Hb are the rate constants of decomposition of the NO donor and the NO reaction with Hb, respectively; [A], [NO], [NO]m are NO donor concentration, NO concentration in solution, and NO concentration on the outer surface of the RBC, respectively; [Hb] ex is extracellular Hb concentration; and r0 and r1 are radii of the RBC and the spherical container as shown in Fig. 1, respectively. In solution, the change of NO concentration at any location between r = r0 and r = r1 can be caused by NO diffusion, NO generation, and NO consumption at that location, which is expressed by the first, second, and third terms in Equation 2. At the boundary r = r0, the diffusion rate of NO into the RBC surface should be equal to the rate of NO transfer across the RBC membrane, so we have Equation 3. At the boundaryr = r1, there is no net NO flow into or out from the container surface, so the gradient of NO concentration atr = r1 should be equal to zero as expressed in Equation 4. All simulated curves in this study were calculated from the analytical expressions derived in the next section on a pentium III personal computer with QBasic programs. To test if increasing hematocrit can change the NO concentration distribution from inhomogeneous to homogeneous, we directly solved the diffusion-reaction Equation 2 and their boundary conditions, Equations3 and 4. Assuming that [A] and [Hb] ex are uniform in the solution during the competition experiment, the general solution for Equation 2 can be expressed as Equation 5,[NO]=k1[A]kHb[Hb]ex+1r[a·exp(−fr)+b·exp(fr)]Equation 5 wheref=kHb[Hb]ex/DNOEquation 6 and constants a and b can be determined by boundary conditions in Equations 3 and 4. Equation 5 is true for [Hb] ex > 0 or fork 1[A]/k Hb[Hb] ex = constant as [Hb] ex approaches zero. In competition experiments, we have [Hb] ex > 0. The combination of Equation 5 with Equations 3 and 4 give us Equation7,[NO]=[NO]b1−Pmr02[(fr1−1)Φ(r)+(fr1+1)/Φ(r)]DNOrY(f,r1,r0)Equation 7 where [NO]b is the NO concentration in solution in the absence of RBCs,[NO]b=k1[A]/kHb[Hb]exEquation 8 Y(f,r1,r0)=(fr1−1)(fr0+1+Pmr0/DNO)Φ(r0)Equation 9 −(fr1+1)(fr0−1−Pmr0/DNO)/Φ(r0)Φ(r)=exp[f(r1−r)]Equation 10a andΦ(r0)=exp[f(r1−r0)]Equation 10b according to the definition of hematocrit, Hct = r03 /r13, we can replace r1 with Hct in Equation 7. NO concentration distribution profiles around the RBC for different Pm and Hct values are shown in Fig. 2, A andB. In the simulations, we used [Hb] ex = 10 μm,k Hb = 89 μm−1s−1 (20 °C) (5Herold S. Exner M. Nauser T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), DNO = 2600 μm2/s (25 °C) (24Lide D.R. Handbook of chemistry and physics. 71st Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1990–1991: 6-151Google Scholar). Since the molar volume of NO is close to the molar volume of oxygen, their diffusion constant would be similar (25Wilke C.R. Chang P. AIChE J. 1955; 1: 264-270Crossref Scopus (3943) Google Scholar). The diffusion constant of oxygen in solution at 25 °C is 2420 μm2/s (26Lide D.R. Handbook of chemistry and physics. 80th Ed. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1999–2000: 6-190Google Scholar); therefore, it is reasonable to take the value of DNO = 2600 μm2/s as the NO diffusion constant at 25 °C. In competition experiments, it was assumed that when hematocrit was smaller then 5%, the extracellular diffusion resistance becomes significant as hematocrit decreases, butk RBC calculated from the competition equation did not include any extracellular diffusion resistance as the hematocrit was greater than 10% (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The profiles of NO concentration that were drawn according to the assumption for competition experiments are shown in Fig. 2 C. In this assumption, the NO concentration distribution in the diffusion layer must have a large change to eliminate the inhomogeneous NO concentration distribution as hematocrit increases from 0.2 to 5%. In order to further test how hematocrit affects the extracellular diffusion resistance, we derived the analytical expression for the flux of NO transfer into RBCs and analyzed how the flux varies with hematocrit. If the flux largely increases with hematocrit or the extracellular diffusion resistance largely decreases with hematocrit, then membrane resistance may become the limiting step to NO transfer into RBCs. The flux of NO diffusion into the RBC is given by Equation 11,Fin=DNOd[NO]/dr‖r=r0=Pm[NO]m=Pmk1[A]Ψ/kHb[Hb]exEquation 11 whereΨ=(fr1−1)(fr0+1)Φ(r0)−(fr1+1)(fr0−1)/Φ(r0)Y(f,r1,r0)Equation 12 In competition experiments, NO donor or NO is used as a probe to measure the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb. It is assumed that the physical properties of the RBC membrane and solution diffusion resistances are independent of [NO] or NO donor concentration [A]. In Equation 11, Fin is proportional to [A], so we use Fn = 3Fin/k 1[A]r0 to obtain a [NO]-independent flux. Fn is proportional to Fin but independent of NO donor concentration [A]. The first derivative of Fn with respect to r1 can be derived from Equation 11 and is shown in Equation13.dFn/dr1=12[f2Pmr0r1/Y(f,r1,r0)]2/(kHb[Hb]exr0DNO)>0Equation 13 Since dFn/dr1 is always larger than zero, Fn will increase as r1increases and decrease as r1 decreases. Fn will decrease as Hct increases because r1 is inversely proportional to Hct13 (Fig. 3). No matter whether the membrane permeability Pm is as high as 0.9 m/s or as low as 0.0018 m/s, Fn always decreases with the increase of Hct. Since Fn does not increase as hematocrit changes from 0 to 5%, extracellular diffusion resistance cannot be appreciably reduced by increasing the hematocrit. It is easy to prove that Equation 1 can be derived from the following two rate equations shown in Equations 14a and 14b, d[metHb]ex/dt=kHb[Hb]ex[NO]Equation 14a d[metHb]RBC/dt=kRBC[Hb]RBC[NO]Equation 14b where [metHb] RBC is defined as the RBC-enclosed metHb in solution if all the RBCs were lysed and [NO] is the extracellular NO concentration. [Hb] RBC can be calculated from hematocrit by Equation 15.[Hb]RBC=cRBCHct=cRBCr03/r13Equation 15 Considering that [metHb] RBC is defined in the whole space within the spherical container, we have Equation16,d[metHb]RBC/dt=SFin/VT=3r02Fin/r13Equation 16 where the surface area of the RBC S is 4π r02 and the volume of the spherical container VT is 4π r13/3. Considering that [metHb] ex is defined in the extracellular solution, we can obtain the formation rate of metHb in extracellular solution in Equation 17.d[metHb]ex/dt=k1[A]{1−3r02PmΨ/kHb[Hb]ex(r13−r03)}Equation 17 The time course of [metHb] ex can be obtained from Equation 17 using numerical integration methods. We compared [metHb] ex predicted from Equation 17with the published experimental data in Fig.4. The points in Fig. 4, A–Cwere read from Fig. 2(a), Fig. 4(a), and Fig. 5(a) in Ref. 13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, respectively. Solid curves were calculated from Equation 17. Parameters used in the calculations are chosen as DNO = 2600 μm2/s and Pm= 0.9 m/s. Since k Hb = 89 μm−1 s−1 was measured at 20 °C (5Herold S. Exner M. Nauser T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3385-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), we have extrapolated this value with a temperature coefficient of 1.4 per 10 °C that was used in estimating rate constants for the reaction of NO or CO with deoxyHb (27Cassoly R. Gibson Q. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 91: 301-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus we obtained k Hb = 105 μm−1 s−1 at 25 °C. The extrapolated value of k Hb was then used in calculating the curves in Fig. 4. Other experimental parameters, such as initial extracellular Hb concentration, initial NO donor concentration, and hematocrit, were the same as those used in the competition experiments of Vaughn et al. (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The expression for the ratiok RBC/k Hb can be obtained by a combination of Equations 14a, 14b, and 15 with Equations 16 and 17as shown in Equation 18.kRBCkHb=[Hb]exd[metHb]RBC/dt[Hb]RBCd[metHb]ex/dt=3Pm(1−Hct)Ψ/kHbcRBCr01−Hct(1+3PmΨ/kHb[Hb]exr0)Equation 18 In Equation 18, [Hb] ex decreases with time in a competition experiment. If [Hb] ex at time t is known, one can find the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb from the equation at time t. In Fig. 5, we compared the predicted curves from Equation 18 with the experimental data. These experimental data were read from Fig. 3 b of Vaughn et al. (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and the two curves ofk RBC/k Hb versus hematocrit were calculated from Equation 18 as Pm = 0.9 m/s (a) and Pm = 4.15 × 10−4 m/s (b). In calculations, we chose DNO = 2600 μm2/s, k Hb= 105 μm−1 s−1, which were the same as those used in Fig. 4. The competition experiments were performed with 9 μm (Hct > 4%) or 2 μm (Hct < 4%) of initial extracellular Hb concentration (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). During competition experiments, [Hb] ex was slowly consumed by the reaction with NO. From Fig. 2a in Ref. 13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar we know that the maximum value of ln([Hb]ex0/[Hb] ex ) in a competition experiment is about 1.3, so [Hb] ex at the end of a competition experiment could be as low as 2.5 μm if ([Hb]ex0 = 9 μm or 0.5 μm if ([Hb]ex0 = 2 μm. Thus, the average [Hb] ex is chosen as 5 μm in our calculations. Fig. 5 shows that the experimental data are in good agreement with curve a, which was calculated under the assumption of extracellular diffusion limitation (Pm = 0.9 m/s). However, curve b calculated under the assumption of membrane resistance limitation (Pm = 4.15 × 10−4 m/s) is very different from the experimental data. Our model predicts that the NO concentration at the RBC surface, [NO]m, is close to zero if Pm = 0.9 m/s, a value reported by Subczynski et al. (28Subczynski W.K. Lomnicka M. Hyde J.S. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) for lipid bilayer membrane. In this case, NO uptake by RBCs would be limited by extracellular diffusion (Fig. 2 A). At Hct = 0.2%, the distance between the RBC surface to the inner wall of the container, r1 − r0, is about 23.5 μm. There is a layer with a big NO concentration gradient (r − r 0 < 6 μm) near the RBC, and a region of uniform NO concentration outside the concentration gradient layer between r − r 0 = 6 μm and r − r 0 = 23.5 μm. The radius of the container r1 decreases with the increase of hematocrit. As Hct = 5%, (r1 − r 0) is reduced to 5.8 μm, and the region of uniform NO concentration disappears. However, the inhomogeneous NO concentration distribution within the concentration gradient layer almost remains unchanged. Thus, in contrast to the assumption of the competition experiments, increasing hematocrit from 0.2 to 5% does not make NO concentration distribution more homogeneous; rather NO concentration distribution is more inhomogeneous. Further increasing hematocrit from 5 to 10% has little effect on the NO concentration gradient near the RBC surface. NO uptake by the RBC is still limited by extracellular diffusion because [NO]m is still close to zero compared with the NO concentration at the inner surface of the container, [NO]c. Fig. 2 B shows the profile of NO concentration as the RBC membrane is 500 times lower, or Pm= 1.8 × 10−3 m/s. Similar to Pm = 0.9 m/s, the NO concentration distribution in solution as Pm = 1.8 × 10−3 m/s is more inhomogeneous, not more homogeneous, as hematocrit increases from 0.2 to 5%. At Hct = 10%, the big NO concentration gradient still exists between the RBC surface and the inner wall of the container. Simply speaking, Fig. 2,A and B show that changing hematocrit from 1.6 to 10% has little effect on extracellular diffusion resistance no matter if Pm is high or low. However, the original assumption of competition experiments (Fig. 2 C), which predicts a complete conversion of inhomogeneous NO concentration distribution into homogeneous NO concentration distribution is in conflict with those predicted by the diffusion-reaction equation (Fig. 2, A andB). Therefore, there is no theoretical basis from which to claim that k RBC determined around Hct = 10% does not include any extracellular diffusion resistance. In fact, there is evidence in the literature for an external diffusional limitation for other small nonelectrolytes, such as O2 and CO (29Huxley V.H. Kutchai H. J. Physiol. 1981; 316: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Coin J.T. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1178-1190Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) across the erythrocyte membrane. Vandegriff and Olson (30Vandegriff K.D. Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12619-12627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the rate of O2 uptake by erythrocytes is inversely proportional to the size of RBC (using erythrocytes from various species as well as liposome-entrapped hemoglobin), a result directly predicted by the existence of an unstirred layer (9Liu X.

Olson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12619-12627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and not predicted on the basis of an inherent diffusion barrier (9Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S.

Chem. 1984; 259: 12619-12627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since NO and O2have similar size and solubility, the permeability of RBC membrane to the two small neutral molecules should be similar. In a previous study, we showed that NO uptake by RBCs at a low hematocrit is limited by extracellular diffusion (9Liu X. Miller M.J. Joshi M.S. Sadowska-Krowicka H. Clark D.A. Lancaster J.R., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18709-18713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). Vaughn et al. (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) also demonstrated that extracellular diffusion is the main resistance to NO uptake by RBCs as Hct = 1.6% in competition experiments. The above theoretical analysis (refer to Fig. 2 A) shows that if NO uptake by RBCs is limited by extracellular diffusion resistance at low hematocrit, the extracellular diffusion resistance would have little change by increasing hematocrit from 0.2 to 10%. Thus NO uptake by RBCs in competition experiments of Vaughn et al. (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) would still be limited by extracellular diffusion resistance. Fig. 4 shows that if NO uptake by RBCs is limited by extracellular diffusion, or Pm = 0.9 m/s, the calculated curves of [metHb] ex at different sets of hematocrit, [Hb] ex and NO donor concentration are in good agreement with experimental data. As shown in Fig. 5, the experimentally determined ratios ofk RBC/k Hb, except the one as Hct = 1.6%, are very close to curve a (Pm = 0.9 m/s), indicating that extracellular diffusion is the main resistance to NO uptake by RBCs. The experimentally determined ratio ofk RBC/k Hb as Hct = 1.6% largely deviates from curve a. This large deviation is caused by a low initial [Hb] ex (2 μm) that was used in the experiment as Hct = 1.6%, because this low [Hb] ex can result in a low ratio ofk RBC/k Hb and may cause a larger relative error in an experimental measurement of [metHb] ex . If we let Pm = 4.15 × 1 0−4 m/s, a very low membrane permeability suggested by Vaughn et al. (14Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5 (.,): 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the simulated curve (curve b) is much lower than the reported ratios ofk RBC/k Hb. The analysis above shows that the rate of NO uptake by RBCs is primarily limited by extracellular NO diffusion in the competition experiments. Mathematically, as long as a non-zero diffusion flux exists around a RBC, the diffusion flux can be always related to a diffusion layer as shown in Equation 19, Flux=Ddcdr=Dcb−csδatr=r0Equation 19 where D is the diffusion coefficient; cb and cs are bulk concentration and surface concentration, respectively; and δ is the thickness of the diffusion layer. Here, the diffusion layer is an imaginary layer, which is used to convert the concentration gradient dc/dr on the RBC membrane into a simple fraction (cb − cs)/δ. Thus, the thickness of the diffusion layer is always related to the concentration gradient on a given surface. In a competition experiment, NO is generated around each RBC, so the diffusion layer is a layer within the unstirred layer around each RBC. In a blood vessel, the shape of the diffusion layer is much different. The blood flow creates an RBC-free layer near the vessel wall and increased concentration of RBCs near the center of the vessel like a flowing RBC cylinder (7Liao J.C. Hein T.W. Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8757-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 10Vaughn M.W. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1705-H1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Butler A.R. Megson I.L. Wright P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1425: 168-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The endothelium-derived NO needs to diffuse across the RBC-free layer to reach RBCs. In this case, the diffusion layer is a layer within the RBC-free layer surrounding the surface of the flowing RBC cylinder. The diffusion layer can reduce NO uptake by RBCs and enhance the effective NO diffusion distance in the vessel wall (10Vaughn M.W. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H1705-H1714Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, we point out that numerous previous studies with erythrocytes do not support the possibility that it possesses an inherent diffusion barrier to small nonelectrolytes, certainly not of the magnitude proposed by Vaughn et al. (13Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2342-2348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 14Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5 (.,): 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The red cell membrane is 40% lipid, which represents a substantial surface of rapid access of NO for diffusion. The lipid bilayer is highly unlikely to possess such a barrier property, since the passive permeability of the RBC to nonelectrolytes is very similar to artificial lipid vesicles (and also other cell types) (31Weiss T.F. Cellular Biophysics. I. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1996: 149Google Scholar), and the permeability characteristics of lipid vesicles made from whole erythrocyte membrane lipids is quantitatively the same as for synthetic lipids (32Carruthers A. Melchior D.L. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5797-5807Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Also, the rate of lateral diffusion of NO in the red cell membrane is similar to phosphatidylcholine vesicles (33Denicola A. Souza J.M. Radi R. Lissi E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 328: 208-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). O2 diffusion through thin films of erythrocytes is similar to that through equivalent thicknesses of free hemoglobin, indicating that the membrane possesses no barrier (34Kutchai H. Staub N.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 1969; 53: 576-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The presence of the complex cytoskeletal network of the erythrocyte and/or binding of hemoglobin to the cytoskeleton also exerts no influence, since the passive permeability of intact red cells to mannitol and erythritol is the same as inside-out vesicles, which lack this cytoskeleton (35Klonk S. Deuticke B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1106: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In addition, if the cytoskeletal network serves as a physical barrier, in order to account for a retardation in entry of a factor of 800 (36Huang K.T. Vaughn M.W. Hyduke D.R. Van Herle H. Hein T.W. Zhang C. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11771-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) this mechanism would require that such a network would cover all but 1/800 = 0.125% of the total inner surface area of the membrane. The spectrin component is an elongated rod that forms a web with large spaces inbetween (37Ursitti J.A. Pumplin D.W. Wade J.B. Bloch R.J. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1991; 19: 227-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As suggested by Huang et al. (36Huang K.T. Vaughn M.W. Hyduke D.R. Van Herle H. Hein T.W. Zhang C. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11771-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), hemoglobin could bind to the membrane and conceivably cover parts of the surface. However, with 106hemoglobin molecules bound to band 3 per erythrocyte (38Shaklai N. Yguerabide J. Ranney H.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5593-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and the size of hemoglobin at 64 × 55 × 50 Å3 (39Voet D. Voet J.G. Biochemistry. 2nd Ed. John Wiley and Sons, New York1995: 224Google Scholar), it can be calculated that the maximum surface area covered by the bound hemoglobin will be 45.7 μm2, whereas the total erythrocyte surface area is 135 μm2 (40Evans E. Fung Y.C. Microvasc. Res. 1972; 4: 335-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). This would not explain a slowing of transmembrane NO movement of nearly 1000-fold. In conclusion, the process of NO transfer into RBCs is of critical biological importance as it regulates the bioavailability and diffusion distance of endothelial derived NO. Our analysis shows that with increasing hematocrit, the distribution of NO concentration becomes more inhomogeneous rather than more homogeneous. Competition experiments did not eliminate extracellular diffusion resistance in measuring the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb under the reported experimental conditions. The rate of NO uptake by RBCs in competition experiments is primarily limited by extracellular diffusion not membrane resistance. The extremely low membrane permeability suggested by Vaughn et al. (14Vaughn M.W. Huang K.T. Kuo L. Liao J.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5 (.,): 18-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) is not only in conflict with many previous experimental results about O2 and NO uptake by RBCs, but also inconsistent with their results about the ratio ofk RBC/k Hb calculated from the competition equation.

These pathways involve the activation of Gα subunits by exchange of GDP for GTP, resulting in the dissociation of Gα from Gβγ subunits. Both subunits transduce signals to a variety of G protein effectors including adenylyl cyclase, voltage-sensitive Ca2+ and K+ channels, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipases C-β and A2, cGMP phosphodiesterase, and indirectly MAP kinase1 (1Hepler J.R.

Numerous studies of the specificity between RGS proteins and Gα subunits have been reported using biochemical, immunochemical, and functional methods. RGS proteins are GAPs for all Gα proteins (5De Vries L. Zheng B. Fisher T. Elenko E. Farquhar M.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol.

RGS5 is a member of RGS subfamily B that includes RGS1–5, -8, -16, and Gα interacting protein (12Hepler J.R. Trends Pharmacol.

RGS5 is highly expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and thoracic aorta (14Seki N. Sugano S. Suzuki Y. Nakagawara A. Ohira M. Muramatsu M. Saito T. Hori T. Hum.

Life Sci. 2001; 68: 1457-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). RGS3 is a structurally distinct member of the RGS subfamily B with a unique long N-terminal domain. It has GAP activity for most Gαi family subunits and Gαq but not for Gαz, Gαs, or Gα12 (16Scheschonka A. Dessauer C.W. Sinnarajah S. Chidiac P. Shi C.S. Kehrl J.H. Mol.

In co-transfection studies of gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor with different RGS cDNAs, only RGS3 expression suppressed gonadotropin-releasing hormone-induced IP3 responses (18Neill J.D.

In pancreatic acinar cells, microinjected RGS4 selectively inhibits calcium signals induced by muscarinic versus cholecystokinin receptors (19Zeng W., Xu, X. Popov S. Mukhopadhyay S. Chidiac P.

An alternatively spliced N-terminal PDZ domain of RGS12 selectively binds to the C terminus of interleukin-8 receptor-B (20Snow B.E. Hall R.A. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Bouchard D. Brothers C.A.

Even though these previous studies have provided evidence for RGS-Gα and RGS receptor specificity, the functional role of endogenous RGS proteins in cells and tissues is still not clear. A few studies on the function of endogenous RGS proteins are emerging. First, endogenous RGS proteins in rat superior cervical ganglion neurons tonically inhibit α2-adrenergic receptor regulation of voltage-gated N-type calcium current, as determined with an RGS-insensitive Gαo subunit (21Jeong S.W. Ikeda S.R. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 4489-4496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Second, in an RGS9-1 knockout mouse, the rapid deactivation of transducin is lost, and the recovery of rod photoresponses is greatly slowed (22Chen C.K. Burns M.E., He, W. Wensel T.G. Baylor D.A. Simon M.I. Nature. 2000; 403: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). RGS2 knockout mice exhibit an “anxious” behavioral phenotype and impaired immunity with reduced T cell proliferation and interleukin-2 production (23Oliveira-dos-Santos A.J. Matsumoto G. Snow B.E. Bai D. Houston F.P. Whishaw I.Q. Mariathasan S. Sasaki T. Wakeham A. Ohashi P.S. Roder J.C. Barnes C.A. Siderovski D.P. Penninger J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12272-12277Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Microinjection of antibodies to RGS12 in primary culture of dorsal root ganglion neurons selectively slows the rate of desensitization of γ-aminobutyric acid, type B-mediated inhibition of tyrosine-phosphorylated N-type calcium channels (24Schiff M.L. Siderovski D.P. Jordan J.D. Brothers G. Snow B., De Vries L. Ortiz D.F. Diverse-Pierluissi M. Nature. 2000; 408: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Finally, stable transfection of a full-length antisense RGS3 cDNA in NIH 3T3 cells abolishes the expression of endogenous RGS3 protein and significantly increases MAP kinase phosphorylation induced by endothelin-1 stimulation (17Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, only fragmentary information is available on the physiological function of endogenous RGS proteins in different cell systems. Vascular smooth muscle participates in the normal control of vascular tone and pathological adaptation of arteries in hypertension and atherosclerosis (25Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. J. Hypertens. 1996; 14: S51-S54Google Scholar) and is controlled by a number of G protein-coupled receptor pathways. The A-10 smooth muscle cell line established from rat thoracic aorta is an excellent model cell system for studying the role of RGS proteins in vascular smooth muscle signal transduction. It retains most of the spectrum of biological responses found in primary vascular smooth muscle cultures (26Yalkinoglu Α.Ο. Spreyer P. Bechem M. Apeler H. Wohlfeil S. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). A-10 cells express multiple receptors that regulate intracellular Ca2+ concentrations through phospholipase C, the Na+/H+ exchanger, and phosphorylation of growth factor receptor-binding protein-2 in regulation of MAP kinase activity (26Yalkinoglu Α.Ο. Spreyer P. Bechem M. Apeler H. Wohlfeil S. J. Recept. Signal. Transduct. Res. 1995; 15: 117-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 27Touyz R.M. Schiffrin E.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 31346-31349Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus A-10 cells contain a variety of endogenous receptor-G protein-effector signaling pathways that allow us to test the hypothesis that specific RGS proteins play important roles in specific signaling pathways in a living cell system. To elucidate functional roles for specific endogenous RGS proteins, we have developed a ribozyme approach to inactivate specifically RGS protein at the mRNA level. In this study, we have inactivated the mRNAs encoding the RGS2, RGS3, RGS5, and RGS7 proteins in A-10 cells and primary culture of vascular smooth muscle cells. The results presented here define specific roles of RGS3 and RGS5 in inhibiting MAP kinase signaling by muscarinic and angiotensin receptors, respectively. This receptor-selective effect of RGS protein function provides new evidence for a unique targeting of RGS action to specific cellular responses. Chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozymes targeted against the RGS domains of rat RGS2, RGS3, RGS5, and RGS7 mRNA were chemically synthesized and modified by introducing two phosphorothioate linkages at the 3′-end using an Applied Biosystems 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems Inc.) and then further purified by desilylating and desalting, as described previously (29Wang Q. Mullah B. Hansen C. Asundi J. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26040-26048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The structure and sequences of targeted sites on rat RGS ribozymes are shown in Fig. 2. Inactive control ribozymes were prepared in the same way but by scrambling the two flanking regions and introducing two point mutations in the catalytic core region (Fig.2 A) which have been shown previously (30Wang Q. Jolly J.P. Surmeier J.D. Mullah B. Lidow M.S. Bergson C.M. Robishaw J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39386-39393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to prevent ribozyme cleavage activity. To generate in vitroRGS RNA transcripts as templates, pCR2.1 plasmids containing mouse RGS3 and RGS5 RGS cDNA were linearized with restriction enzymes (BamHI and SpeI, respectively) and then transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase as recommended by the supplier (Promega, Madison, WI). To perform the in vitro cleavage experiment, the ribozyme and RGS RNA were denatured separately in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, at 90 °C for 30 s, then mixed in the presence of 20 mm MgCl2 (total volume of 10 μl), and incubated at 50 or 37 °C for 1 h. Two pmol of template and 100 pmol of ribozyme were used. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 volume of stop solution consisting of 95% formamide and 60 mm Na-EDTA, pH 8.0, and subjected to denaturing mini-gel electrophoresis (5% polyacrylamide, 7m urea) as described previously (31Grassi G. Forlino A. Marini J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3451-3458Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed. The A-10 cell line, derived from the thoracic aorta of a DB1X embryonic rat, was obtained from the ATCC (catalog number CRL-1476) and grown in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 4 mm glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. The primary culture of rat smooth muscle cells (RAOSMC) derived from the tunica intima and inner layer of tunica media of healthy and fibrous plaque-free rat aorta were obtained from Cell Application, Inc. (San Diego, CA, catalog number R354-05) and grown in Rat Smooth Muscle Cell Growth Medium (Cell Application, Inc.). Both cells were maintained in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2in air atmosphere. A day before transfection, cells were plated in either 100-mm dishes (for analysis of protein suppression) or 6-well plates (for analysis of mRNA suppression, MAP kinase assay and IPx assay) and transfected at ∼60–80% confluence with LipofectAMINE PLUS (Invitrogen) or Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen, for MAP kinase and IPx assay only) according to the supplier's manual. The amount of RGS ribozyme transfected was 4 μg with 30 μl of LipofectAMINE for the 100-mm dish and 1 μg with 4 μl of LipofectAMINE for the 6-well plate, respectively. For Effectene, 0.5 μg of ribozyme and 12.5 μl of Effectene transfection reagent were used per well in 6-well plates. Sham transfection was done with either pcDNA3.1 plasmid or inactive ribozyme as indicated. The transfection efficiency, determined by transfection with the yellow fluorescent protein expression vector pEYFP (CLONTECH), was about 40–50% for either Effectene or LipofectAMINE methods in both cells. Total RNAs were prepared from either rat brain or A-10 cells with or without RGS-specific ribozyme transfection using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) and then subjected to the RT-PCR with SuperScriptTM One-StepTMRT-PCR System according to the supplier's manual (Invitrogen). A negative control was done using Ready-to-Go You-Prime First-Strand Beads (Amersham Biosciences) in which the first step of reverse transcription was omitted in the RT-PCR. Primer pairs generated from the RGS-coding region were used to amplify each RGS as shown in TableI. Each pair of primers was first checked by amplifying RGS plasmid DNA to make sure that the correct size of the PCR product was achieved. For amplifying RGS2, RGS3, RGS7, and RGS9 in A-10 cells, total RNA of 200–400 ng was used with 0.3 μmprimer and 1.2 mm MgSO4 in a 25-μl volume. The reverse transcription was performed at 45 °C for 30 min and followed by PCR with 35–40 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Different conditions were required for amplifying RGS5; total RNA of 400–800 ng was used with 8% Me2SO and 1.8 mm MgSO4in a 25-μl volume, and then the RT-PCR was performed for 45 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Similar conditions were used for amplifying RGS in RAOSMC by RT-PCR. For amplifying muscarinic receptor mRNA, subtype-specific primers for rat muscarinic receptors were designed as follows: m1, sense 5′-GAACACCTCAGTGCC-3′, antisense 5′-AGAGCTGCCCTTCGG-3′ (product 428 bp); m2, sense 5′-GGCTTGGCTATTACCAGTCC-3′, antisense 5′-GAGGATGAAGGAAAGGAC-3′ (product 432 bp); m3, sense 5′-CAACCTCGCCTTTGTTTCC-3′, antisense 5′-GGACAAAGGAGATGACCC-3′ (product 569 bp); m4, sense 5′CTTCACGCCTGTCAATGG 3′, antisense 5′-CTCTTGCCCACCACAAAC-3′ (product 422 bp); and m5, sense 5′-GGAAGGGGAGTCTTACAATG-3′, antisense 5′-GGAACTGGATCTGGCACTC-3′(product 556 bp). For RT-PCR of muscarinic receptors, 50 ng of total RNA from either rat brain or A-10 cells was amplified at 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 40 s for 30 cycles in a 12.5-μl volume. Elongation factor 1α was amplified under identical condition as an internal control. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1.8% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide stimulated with a Kodak ImageStation, and photographed. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry analysis using the Kodak One-dimensional 3.5 software.Table IRGS composition in A-10 cellsRGScDNA clonePrimer sequences 5′ to 3′Expected productmRNAProtein bp 2HumanATGTTCCTGGCTGTCCAGCAC TCATGTAGCATGGGGCTCCG623YesND 3MouseGAACTGGGTCGTAATGGAGGC CCTCTTTGCAAGCCTGGATTGC456YesYes 4RatATGTGCAAAGGACTCGCTGGTC TTAGGCACACTGAGGGACTAG615NoND 5MouseGCCTGTGAGAATTACAAGAAG AGGGCGTAGATCCTTTTCTG198YesND 6HumanCTGGCCGTCCAAGATCTCAAG CAGCTTGTAGATGTGCTCCTG198NoND 7HumanCCAAGCCTCCTACAGAAGATG GGTAGGCACTAGATCTTATAAAG584YesNo 9MouseATGACGATCCGACACCAAGGC CTTCTTCATGAGCATGTAAATG1193YesYes11HumanGAGGCGTGTGAGGAGCTGC GAGCATGTAGATGTGCAGTTG198YesNDRT-PCR primers specific for the rat RGS subtypes (except for RGS3 and RGS7 sense primers that were from mouse sequences) were designed to anneal to the indicated sequences.

Of the RGS proteins detected at the mRNA level in A-10 cells (RGS2, -3, -5, and -7), only RGS3, -7, and -9 antibodies were useful for Western blotting. Whole cell lysates were prepared from A-10 cells transfected with or without RGS ribozyme by suspending them in RIPA lysis buffer containing 1× phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Igepal CA-630 (Sigma), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS with fresh addition of 0.15–0.3 TIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin. Cells were passed 10 times through a 21-gauge needle; 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added, and the mixture was incubated for another 1 h on ice and finally centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was saved as total cell lysate. Protein (60–100 μg) was subjected to SDS-PAGE on an 8% mini-gel and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P transfer membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% milk in TBS (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) without Tween 20 for 1 h and incubated with 1:200 anti-RGS3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-9304) overnight in the cold room. For screening RGS7 and RGS9 proteins, antibodies kindly supplied by Drs. Theodore Wensel (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX) and Vladlen Slepak (University of Miami School of Medicine, FL) were used at 1:1,000 to 1:2,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. After three consecutive washes with TBS plus 0.05% Tween 20 (10 min for each), the membrane was incubated with 1:10,000 secondary antibody (anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase linked F(ab′)2 fragment from donkey,Amersham Biosciences, catalog number NA 9340) for 1 h at room temperature. Prestained SDS-PAGE protein standards (Bio-Rad, catalog number 161-0309) were used to determine the size of detected proteins. For RGS3 samples, the blots were re-blotted with anti-G protein β-subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-378) at 1:20,000 dilution after stripping as an internal control for the determination of protein loading. Proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce). The intensity of bands was quantified by densitometry analysis of films in the linear range of exposure using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet scanner. A day before transfection, cells were plated into 6-well plates and transfected with either inactive or RGS-specific ribozymes with the Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen). Thirty hours after transfection, cells were put into serum-free medium and then at 72 h post-transfection were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stimulated with the appropriate agonist for 5 min, and finally harvested by addition of 250 μl of Stopping Buffer containing 1× Protein Loading Buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 0.15–0.3 TIU/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. For RAOSMC, cells were starved for 48 h and lysed with 100 μl/well 1× SDS Sample Buffer containing 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 50 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% bromphenol blue and immediately scraped off the plate. Then samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled on ice. Finally, the lysates were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to ImmobilonTM-P transfer membrane for Western blotting. For A-10 cells, the blot was first probed with phospho-ERK antibody (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-7383) to measure the activated phospho-ERK and visualized by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal West Dura (Pierce). Generally, only a single band at 42 kDa corresponding to phospho-ERK2 was observed in the A-10 cells. Some experiments showed a faint signal at 44 kDa corresponding to ERK1, but only the ERK2 results could be analyzed. The same blot was stripped and re-blotted with anti-ERK-2 which is reactive with ERK2 p42 and to a lesser extent with ERK1 p44 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-153) to measure total ERK2 levels. MAP kinase activity was expressed as normalized arbitrary units (a.u.) of phosphorylated p42 MAP kinase (ERK2) over total ERK2 by densitometry analysis of films in the linear range of exposure using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet scanner. For RAOSMC, the blot was first probed with Phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Thr-202/Tyr-204) E10 monoclonal antibody (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, catalog number 9106) to measure the activated phospho-ERK and visualized by chemiluminescence with SuperSignal (Pierce). Both p44 and p42 bands corresponding to phospho-ERK1/2 were observed in RAOSMC cells. The same blot was stripped and re-blotted with anti-ERK-2 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-153) to measure total ERK levels. MAP kinase activity was expressed as normalized a.u. of phosphorylated p42/44 ERK over total ERK by densitometry analysis of films in the linear range of exposure using a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet scanner. Statistical analysis was done by using one- and two-way analysis of variance in Prism (GraphPad software, version 3.01) with Tukey's Multiple Comparison post-test to identify specific effects of the ribozymes. Measurment of inositol phosphates (IPx including inositol monophosphate, inositol bisphosphate, and inositol triphosphates) was done as described previously (32Dudley D.T. Panek R.L.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAOSMC cells were transfected with ribozymes as done for the MAP kinase assay. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated with [3H]myoinositol (10 μCi/ml/dish) for another 24 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without inositol. Labeling was terminated by aspirating the medium and rinsing cells with oxygenated reaction buffer containing 142 mm NaCl, 30 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, 5.6 mm KCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm LiCl, and 1 mg/ml d-glucose. The stimulation of IPx production was initiated by incubating cells with different concentrations of AngII in 0.5 ml of reaction buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Then the reaction was stopped by adding 0.5 ml of ice-cold 20% trichloroacetic acid, and samples were kept on ice for another 30 min. Cells were scraped, and precipitates were pelleted (4100 × g, 20 min). The trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction was transferred to a new tube, extracted with water-saturated diethyl ether three times, and then neutralized with NaHCO3. Finally, IPx was isolated by adsorption to 0.5 ml of 50% (w/w) Dowex AG 1-X8 formate resin slurry and rinsed with unlabeled 5 mm myoinositol three times, followed by elution with 1 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate and 0.1m formic acid. The elutes were counted by liquid scintillation counter in 10 ml of ScintiVerse. A-10 or RAOSMC cells were transfected using the same conditions as for the MAPK assays and rinsed with 1 ml of assay buffer containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma catalog number A-6003) and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin in Opti-MEM medium. Then cells were incubated with 100 pm[125I-Tyr4]angiotensin II (human, 2200 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, catalog number NEX105) in the assay buffer for 1 h at room temperature. For nonspecific binding, separate dishes were incubated with the same hot buffer plus 10 μm saralasin (Sigma catalog number A-2275). After incubation, cells were washed three times with assay buffer and precipitated with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid for another 30 min in the cold room. Finally, the supernatant was aspirated and counted by liquid scintillation counter in 10 ml of ScintiVerse. Nonspecific binding represented ∼0.3% of total binding. Consistent with the known variety of endogenous receptor-G protein-effector pathways in A-10 cells, we have identified a number of RGS proteins that are expressed at both the mRNA and the protein levels in these cells. Previous studies have shown that RGS2, -3, and -10–12 and Gα interacting protein mRNA are present in primary cultures of rat vascular smooth muscle cells (34Grant S.L. Lassegue B. Griendling K.K. Ushio-Fukai M. Lyons P.R. Alexander R.W. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and RGS1, -3–7, -9, -12, -14, and -16 are detectable in cardiomyocytes (35Kardestuncer T., Wu, H. Lim A.L. Neer E.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested eight RGS genes for expression in A-10 cells by RT-PCR. Five (RGS2, -3, -5, -7, and -9) of the eight tested RGSs were detected strongly at the mRNA level by RT-PCR (Fig. 1). RGS11 was weakly detected (data not shown), and RGS4 and RGS6 were not detectable. Positive control cDNA clones for all eight were readily amplified indicating correct choice of primers. At the protein level, only a few anti-RGS antibodies were tested due to the limited availability of good quality anti-RGS-specific antibodies. An RGS3 antibody detected a doublet at 60 kDa"

Yet, the specific cellular defects that cause insulin resistance are not precisely known.

Recently, serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins has been implicated in attenuating insulin signaling and is thought to be a potential mechanism for insulin resistance. However, in vivo increased serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins in insulin-resistant animal models has not been reported before. In the present study, we have confirmed previous findings in both JCR:LA-cp and Zucker fatty rats, two genetically unrelated insulin-resistant rodent models, that an enhanced serine kinase activity in liver is associated with insulin resistance. The enhanced serine kinase specifically phosphorylates the conserved Ser789 residue in IRS-1, which is in a sequence motif separate from the ones for MAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), Akt, phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, or casein kinase. It is similar to the phosphorylation motif for AMP-activated protein kinase, but the serine kinase in the insulin-resistant animals was shown not to be an AMP-activated protein kinase, suggesting a potential novel serine kinase. Using a specific antibody against Ser(P)789peptide of IRS-1, we then demonstrated for the first time a striking increase of Ser789-phosphorylated IRS-1 in livers of insulin-resistant rodent models, indicating enhanced serine kinase activity in vivo.

However, whether any of these kinases and serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 are associated with insulin resistance in animal models has not been established.We previously studied liver extracts from insulin-resistant rodents and showed enhanced serine kinase activity for IRS-1 in vitro(40Qiao L.Y.

In this report, we have identified the specific serine phosphorylation site (Ser789) on IRS-1 for the enhanced serine kinase activity. We then used a specific antibody that recognizes Ser(P)789 to confirm the increased Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in two genetically unrelated insulin-resistant rat models: Zucker fatty rats and JCR:LA-cp obese rats. The identity of the enhanced serine kinase is still not known; however, our study excluded all serine kinases known to phosphorylate IRS-1, indicating that a novel serine kinase exists that may underlie the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance.DISCUSSIONSerine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been implicated as a mechanism of attenuated insulin signaling, the so-called “insulin resistance” (20Ricort J.M.

Identification of serine phosphorylation sites on IRS-1 and the kinase that phosphorylates IRS-1 are important steps toward the understanding of the molecular mechanism of insulin resistance. We previously identified enhanced serine kinase activity in liver extracts of JCR:LA-cp obese rats using an in vitro kinase assay combined with phosphotryptic peptide mapping analysis (40Qiao L.Y. Goldberg J.L. Russell J.C. Sun X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The current study identified that the phosphorylation site for this kinase is Ser789 of IRS-1. Furthermore, we now demonstrate in vivo for the first time that Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 is increased in liver of the insulin-resistant rat model using both immunofluorescence staining or immunoblotting analysis. The fact that identical results were obtained in two genetically unrelated insulin-resistant rat models, JCR:LA-cp and Zucker rats (41Zucker L.M. Antoniades H.N. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 49Russell J.C. Ahuja S.K. Manickavel V. Rajotte R.V. Amy R.M. Arteriosclerosis. 1987; 7: 620-626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggests that our findings may generally apply to the insulin-resistant state. Conclusive evidence of increased Ser789phosphorylation of IRS-1 in vivo together with the in vitro detection of enhanced serine kinase activity in both insulin-resistant animal models leads us to speculate that this as yet unidentified serine kinase, which physiologically or pathophysiologically modulates insulin sensitivity, is a mechanism of impaired insulin effectiveness in liver.IRS proteins are important signaling molecules that become tyrosyl-phosphorylated during insulin stimulation and activate the insulin signaling network through interaction with downstream signaling molecules, including PI3K, Grb-2/Sos, and SHP-2 (5White M.F.

Recent studies in cultured cells have shown that IRS-1 becomes serine-phosphorylated after prolonged exposure to many factors, including insulin, TNF-α, glucose, or free fatty acids, and consequently fails to become tyrosyl-phosphorylated, resulting in attenuation of the insulin response (20Ricort J.M.

Based on these findings, an attractive hypothesis has emerged that serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins is a cause of insulin resistance. Searching for IRS-1 serine kinases led to the identification of many serine kinases, including casein kinase II, PI3K, Akt and mTor (33Tanasijevic M.J. Myers M.G., Jr. Thomas R.S. Crimmons D.L.

Glycogen-synthase kinase 3 and MAPK have also been reported to phosphorylate IRS-1in vitro and in vivo and to impair insulin action in cultured cells (31De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

A. 1997; 94: 9660-9664Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Recently, TNF-α-induced serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 has been mapped to Ser307 in IRS-1, which is phosphorylated in vitro by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (36Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar). Mutation on this site completely abolished the ability of TNF-α to induce insulin resistance in the mutant cells (36Aguirre V. Uchida T. Yenush L. Davis R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9047-9054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1157) Google Scholar, 59Rui L. Aguirre V. Kim J.K. Shulman G.I. Lee A. Corbould A. Dunaif A. White M.F. J. Clin.

However, the relevance of this phosphorylation on IRS-1 to the insulin resistance in animal models has not been shown.We thus took an alternate approach to investigate serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 using tissue extracts from insulin-resistant rodents. Most importantly, we used two genetically distinct models, Zucker fatty (fa/fa) rats and JCR:LA-cp rats (41Zucker L.M. Antoniades H.N. Endocrinology. 1972; 90: 1320-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar,49Russell J.C. Ahuja S.K. Manickavel V. Rajotte R.V. Amy R.M.

We established an in vitro kinase assay using GST-IRS-1 fragments as substrates and tissue extracts as the kinase source (40Qiao L.Y. Goldberg J.L. Russell J.C. Sun X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and identified an enhanced serine kinase activity, in liver extracts from both obese animals, that phosphorylates IRS-1 at a region between amino acid residues 526 and 859. The current study has determined the Ser789 residue in IRS-1 as the phosphorylation site for this serine kinase based on several criteria. First, radioamino acid sequencing analysis data predicted that Ser789 was the phosphorylation site. Second, GST-IRS1-(765–816) eliminated all the MAPK phosphorylation sites without altering phosphorylation by the enhanced serine kinase activity. Third, mutation of Ser789 in IRS-1 completely abolished phosphorylation by the enhanced serine kinase activity. Furthermore, Ser789 appears to be the only major phosphorylation site in IRS-1 for the enhanced serine kinase activity, because full-length IRS-1 produced one predominant tryptic phosphopeptide (P3) that was identical to that derived from phosphorylated GST-IRS1-(526–859) or GST-IRS1-(765–816) on Tricine SDS-PAGE and HPLC profiles.The previously cited studies have shown that various reagents (TNF-α, insulin, and glucose) promote serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, but there has been no in vivo evidence prior to this study supporting the validity of these findings to the insulin resistance in animal models. Mapping the serine phosphorylation site in IRS-1 to Ser789 allowed us to generate a phosphoserine-specific antibody (αIRS1PS789) for in vivo testing. The specificity of αIRS1PS789 was confirmed by several criteria. First, αIRS1PS789 did not recognize GST-IRS1-(765–816) protein even in a high concentration (0.5 μg/lane) by immunoblotting unless it was phosphorylated by liver extracts in vitro in the presence of ATP. Second, αIRS1PS789 recognized wild type IRS-1 by immunoblotting when phosphorylated in vitro by the liver extracts, but mutation on Ser789 of IRS-1 completely eliminated this recognition. Because both wild type IRS-1 and IRS-1S789A in CHO/IR/IRS-1 or CHO/IR/IRS-1S789A cells are heavily phosphorylated on serines in the basal state (manifested by the identical high molecular mass of 185 kDa on SDS-PAGE gel) (40Qiao L.Y.

Backer J.M. Kahn C.R. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22662-22672Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our data show that αIRS1PS789 is highly specific for Ser(P)789 and does not recognize other phosphoserines in IRS-1.αIRS1PS789 was subsequently used to assess the Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in vivo using liver slices from normally sensitive and insulin-resistant Zucker rats. Using semiquantitative immunofluorescence imaging, we clearly demonstrated that Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 markedly increased in livers of the two studied insulin-resistant animal models. Increased Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in insulin-resistant animals was further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analysis. This finding is dramatic, because the level of IRS-1 protein was decreased in the insulin-resistant obese rats as reported from other laboratories (15Saad M.J. Araki E. Miralpeix M. Rothenberg P.L. White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1839-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 18Anai M. Funaki M. Ogihara T. Terasaki J. Inukai K. Katagiri H. Fukushima Y. Yazaki Y. Kikuchi M. Oka Y. Asano T. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Increased Ser789 phosphorylation of IRS-1 in vivo in insulin-resistant states leads us to speculate that the enhanced serine kinase activity could be the potential molecular linker for insulin resistance in livers of these animals.The identity of the responsible serine kinase is currently unknown. Serine 789 exists in a highly conserved motif among human, rat, and mouse IRS-1 (Fig. 5) and is not part of a known motif for MAPK, JNK, GST-3, casein kinase II, PI3K, Akt, or mTor. Interestingly, this motif is similar to one of the phosphorylation motifs for AMP-activated kinase: YXXXX S XXXY, whereY is a hydrophobic residue (Met, Val, Leu, Ile, or Phe) (43Dale S. Wilson W.A. Edelman A.M. Hardie D.G. Growth Regul. 1995; 361: 191-195Google Scholar,54Michell B.J. Stapleton D. Mitchelhill K.I. House C.M. Katsis F. Witters L.A. Kemp B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28445-28450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The fact that AMPK is able to phosphorylate IRS-1 at Ser789 (39Jakobsen S.N. Hardie D.G. Morrice N. Tornqvist H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46912-46916Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) raises the possibility that the serine kinase might be an AMPK. However, our results disagree with this possibility. First, the enhanced serine kinase activity in the insulin-resistant animal is not activated by AMP. Second, AMP-activated kinase activity is suppressed in the liver extracts where the enhanced serine kinase activity is readily detected. Third, AMPK is not enhanced in insulin-resistant animals, consistent with the literature (55Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the enhanced serine kinase cannot be depleted from tissue extracts by anti-AMPK immunoprecipitation. Collectively, these data suggest that, although it can phosphorylate IRS-1 on Ser789 in vitro, AMPK activity is not the operative serine kinase in the studied insulin-resistant animals. The definitive identification will depend on the purification and characterization of this serine kinase.MAPK has been shown to phosphorylate IRS-1 in vitro andin vivo at Ser612, leading to the inhibition of subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by the insulin receptor (30De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 31De Fea K. Roth R.A. J. Biol.

Moreover, the phosphorylation of a synthetic IRS-1 peptide containing Ser612 by liver extracts was significantly higher in ob/ob mice than in lean controls (30De Fea K. Roth R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12939-12947Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). We did not detect enhanced MAPK activity in liver extracts from either the JCR:LA-cp obese rats or Zucker fatty rats, even when myelin basic protein was used as a substrate (data not shown). We do not believe that this discrepancy was due to the preparation procedure of liver extracts (50% (NH4)2SO4precipitation), because this same procedure was able to enrich MAPK activity in rat liver (40Qiao L.Y. Goldberg J.L. Russell J.C. Sun X.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10625-10632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Thus, our results do not support MAPK being the operative kinase in the livers of the studied insulin-resistant rat models.The biochemical mechanism by which serine phosphorylation attenuates insulin signaling is an intriguing issue that currently lacks definitive"

HU belongs to the family of architectural nuclear proteins that control DNA topology by introducing bends into double-stranded (ds)1 DNA and stabilize higher-order nucleoprotein complexes. HU resembles eukaryotic proteins of the high mobility group (HMG) class in its DNA binding properties because it binds dsDNA with low affinity and no sequence specificity. In contrast, it displays high affinity for some altered DNA structures such as junctions, nicks, gaps, forks, and overhangs even under stringent salt conditions (14Pontiggia A. Negri A. Beltrame M.

The DNA structural motif for HU recognition consists of either two dsDNA modules with propensity to be inclined or one dsDNA module adjacent to a ssDNA binding module (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography and NMR studies have established the structure of HU dimer in the absence of DNA (20Tanaka I. Appelt K.

Our recent studies suggest that HU contacts duplex DNA via the minor groove with its flexible arms, whereas the high affinity binding to its specific binding motif requires an additional contact with the HU body (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Similar to histones, HU has been shown to bind to poly(U) homopolymer, 2J. Rouviere-Yaniv, unpublished data. but the role of this abundant protein in RNA binding was underestimated. Recently we have shown that HU binds with high affinity to mRNA fromrpoS, encoding the stress sigma factor of RNA polymerase, and stimulates its translation (23Balandina A. Claret L. Hengge-Aronis R. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in parallel to this work it was shown that HBsu, the HU protein of Bacillus subtilis, specifically binds the Alu domain of a small cytoplasmic RNA (scRNA), a homologue of mammalian signal recognition particle RNA (24Nakamura K.

We measured HU affinity to total cellular RNA and found that HU binds to RNA as strongly as to supercoiled DNA, formerly believed to be the main target for the nucleoid-associated HU (2Rouviere-Yaniv J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1978; 42: 439-447Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The characteristics of HU-nonspecific binding to double-stranded RNA and DNA as well as to simple linear DNA-RNA hybrids are shown to be similar. In contrast, HU binding to discontinuous DNA-RNA structures is much stronger than that to DNA and RNA duplexes and displays the same affinity as with nicked DNA, one of the structures that HU binds specifically. We searched for the structural determinant(s) of HU-RNA recognition using DsrA RNA, a small noncoding stable RNA that modulates the translation of several key transcriptional regulators such RpoS or H-NS (34Sledjeski D.

We found that DsrA RNA is one of the specific targets for HU binding. Truncation of DsrA RNA showed that HU bound with high affinity an RNA structure similar to that of a DNA overhang, one of its specific targets on DNA (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J.

The DNA fragments corresponding to DsrA RNA and DsrA deletion mutants RNA C, D, and E were amplified by PCR using the pDDS164 plasmid (provided by S. Gottesman, Ref. 34Sledjeski D. Gottesman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as a template and appropriate primers. In the case of the smallest RNA-F, two complementary DNA oligonucleotides were annealed. The resulting DNAs were cloned under the control of the T7 promoter into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pGem3Z (Promega). The [α-32P]RNAs were synthesized from a plasmid linearized with HindIII by in vitrotranscription. Before use, the RNAs were renatured by incubating at 65 °C for 5 min and cooling on ice. For construction of the RNA duplex the DNA synthetic oligonucleotides X1 and Y1 were annealed with their complementary DNA strands and cloned under the control of the T7 promoter into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pGem3Z. The corresponding α-32P-labeled X and non-labeled Y RNA were prepared from plasmid linearized with HindIII byin vitro transcription. These complementary RNAs were annealed in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl) by incubation at 80 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling. For the construction of the DNA-RNA hybrid, the synthetic DNA oligonucleotide H was annealed with α-32P-labeled X RNA in buffer A as described above. The following oligonucleotides X1, Y1, H, and X RNA are: X1, AATTCGGGTAGGAGCCACCTTATGAGGAATTCGCCCA; Y1, AATTCCTCATAAGGTGGCTCCTACCCGAATTCGCCCA; H, TGGGCGAATTCCTC ATAAGGTGGCTCCTACCCGAATTCGCCC; X RNA, GG- GCGAATTCGGGTAGGAGCCACCTTATGAGGAATTCGCCCA. Duplex DNA was constructed from oligonucleotide H, and a complimentary oligonucleotide. DNA containing a nick was constructed from oligonucleotides X, C, and D. 3′-DNA overhang was constructed from oligonucleotides X and C. DNA-RNA nick and 3′-DNA-RNA overhang were constructed as DNA structures, but oligonucleotide C was replaced with the corresponding oligoribonucleotide. Oligonucleotides X and H were 5′-labeled and annealed with appropriate oligonucleotides or oligoribonucleotides in buffer A by incubation at 80 °C for 3 min followed by slow cooling. The following oligonucleotides X, C, and D are: X, AGTCTAGACTGCAGTTGAGTCCTTGCTAGGACGGAT- CCCT; C, A CTCAACTGCAGTCTAGACT (5′-phosphorylated); D, AGGGATCCGTCCTAGCAAG G. Binding assays were carried out as described previously (20Tanaka I. Appelt K. Dijk J. White S.W. Wilson K.S. Nature. 1984; 310: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) in high salt buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) or in low salt buffer, which had the same ingredients but contained only 10 mm NaCl. Electrophoresis was carried out either in 22.5 or 90 mm Tris borate buffer, pH 8.6, for low or high salt conditions, respectively. Total RNA was prepared by hot phenol extraction of E. coli K-12 C600 cells grown in LB medium to exponential phase. E. coli bulk tRNA was a gift from A. Rak. The supercoiled form of the plasmid pNB1 (Biolabs) was purified on an agarose gel and electroeluted. To prepare the linear DNA sample, the same plasmid was linearized withScaI. HU protein at a final concentration of 13 nm was mixed with 2 fmol of 32P-labeled nicked DNA, and varying concentrations of non-labeled nucleic acids were added in 15 μl of high salt buffer. Samples were analyzed as described previously (23Balandina A. Claret L. Hengge-Aronis R. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). At equilibrium, the dissociation constant of the complex formed by one nucleic acid molecule and one HU dimer is given by Equation 1, Kd=[proteinfree]×[nucleic acidfree]/[nucleic acidbound]Equation 1 where [proteinfree] is the concentration of HU not bound to nucleic acid, [nucleic acidfree] is the concentration of the protein binding sites, [nucleic acidbound] is the concentration of the nucleic acid molecules occupied by the protein, and [proteinfree] = [proteintotal] − [proteinbound] and [proteinbound] = [nucleic acidbound]. Finally, [nucleic acidbound] = [nucleic acidtotal] × b/[(f + b) × (number of protein binding sites on nucleic acid molecule)]. For a DNA that is N bp long, the number of binding sites for the ligand that covers L bp, is (N −L + 1) per DNA molecule. The values f and b measured in the experiment are proportional to the concentration of free and bound nucleic acids, respectively, quantified in arbitrary units. The radioactivity of the bands corresponding to f (free) and b (bound) fractions was determined by PhosphorImager analysis of dried gels. Thus, the final equation for calculation of the dissociation constant of the first protein-nucleic acid complex is shown in Equation 2. Kdnonspecific=[proteintotal]×(f/b)×(N−L+1)Equation 2 −[nucleic acidtotal]×(f/(f+b))×(N−L+1)Notice that this equation is adequate for nonspecific binding when the affinity of the protein is the same for any L-bp binding site of an N-bp long nucleic acid. For a nucleic acid molecule containing one specific binding site, if nonspecific interaction is negligible, we have Equation 3. Kdspecific=[proteintotal]×f/b−[nucleic acidtotal]×f/(f+b)Equation 3 The best fit over several protein concentrations was taken asK d . Equation 1 serves as an evaluation of HU dissociation constant for the first complex. Binding of the second HU dimer might be facilitated by the protein-protein interactions that can be measured by the factor of cooperativity, ω. The ω factor is determined as K d1 /K d2 , whereK d1 and K d2 are the dissociation constants of the first and second complexes, respectively. For binding of HU to double-stranded DNA, RNA, and the DNA-RNA hybrid the ω has been determined as described previously (15Bonnefoy E. Takahashi M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 116-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 18Pinson V. Takahashi M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The apparent dissociation constant of HU to non-labeled nucleic acids was calculated as in Equation 4, Kda=[Pfree]×[Afree]/[PA]Equation 4 where [Afree] is the concentration of free non-labeled nucleic acid. Assuming that binding is nonspecific and that the nucleic acid is much longer than a protein binding site, [Afree] is equal to the concentration of base pairs of free nucleic acid. [Pfree] is the concentration of the free protein, and [PA] is the concentration of the protein bound to non-labeled nucleic acid. The protein concentration in the tube [Ptotal] equals [Pa] + [Pn] + [Pfree], where [Pn] is the concentration of the protein bound to labeled nicked DNA. Because nicked DNA concentration is much less than that of non-labeled nucleic acid, then [Pa] = [Ptotal] − [Pfree]. The concentration of total non-labeled nucleic acid is [Atotal] = [Afree] + [Abound]. Because [Abound] = [Pa] × L, where L is the length of the binding site of the protein in bp, then [Afree] = [Atotal] − [Pa] × L. The dissociation constant of HU with nicked DNA isKN = [Pfree] × f/b, where f and b are proportional to the concentrations of free and bound nicked DNA, respectively, and the radioactivity of the bands corresponding to f (free) and b (bound) fractions was determined by PhosphorImager analysis of dried gels. Thus, [Pfree] =KN × b/f, and we have Equations Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 7, Kda=[Pfree]×[Afree]/[PA]=[Pfree]×{[Atotal]Equation 5 −[Pa]×L}/[PA]=[Pfree]×{[Atotal]/[PA]−L} Kda=[Pfree]×{[Atotal]/([Ptotal]−[Pfree])−L}Equation 6 where [Pfree] = KN × b/f or as in Equation 7. Kda=(KN×b/f)×{[Atotal]/([Ptotal]−KN×b/f)−L}Equation 7 These equations were obtained assuming that the number of binding sites is equal to the length of the nucleic acid. This is the case when DNA is far from saturated with the protein. The saturation of the DNA can be evaluated according to the McGhee-von Hippel equation (39McGhee J.D. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (2737) Google Scholar). We estimated that under the experimental conditions used, DNA is far from saturated. Indeed, in our experiments the amount of the competitor added is 100–1000 bp per one HU dimer. HU is one of the most abundant DNA-binding proteins in the bacterial cells. In contrast to its low affinity salt-sensitive binding to duplex linear DNA, HU binds with high affinity to DNA damage and repair intermediates under high salt conditions (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We also have found recently that HU specifically recognizes the mRNA from rpoS and stimulates its translation (23Balandina A. Claret L. Hengge-Aronis R. Rouviere-Yaniv J. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 1069-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HU affinity to RpoS mRNA fragment is as high as that to nicked DNA, which is 1000-fold higher than that for double-stranded DNA. Because it appears that HU is able to bind DNA and RNA, both nucleic acids may serve as HU binding targets in the cell. This finding prompted us to further investigate the RNA binding properties of HU. We first measured the affinity of HU to the major DNA and RNA species present in the bacterial cell. HU binding to supercoiled and linear DNA as well as to total cellular RNA and tRNA was compared. Gel mobility shift assays can not be applied directly to separate free and bound high molecular weight nucleic acids because plasmid DNA is too bulky to be gel-shifted by HU, and total RNA is too disperse in size to form sharp bands in the gel. To tackle the problem we applied an assay on which one nucleic acid of interest competes with labeled 40-bp nicked DNA for HU binding. HU forms a single complex with the nicked DNA with an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of 10 nm under stringent salt conditions (16Castaing B. Zelwer C. Laval J. Boiteux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10291-10296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Kamashev D. Balandina A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5434-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Pinson V. Takahashi M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). HU was mixed with labeled nicked DNA, and the complex was challenged with increasing amounts of the non-labeled nucleic acid of interest. The progressive decrease in HU-nicked DNA complex upon increase in the concentration of non-labeled DNA or RNA reflects a decrease in the concentration of free HU in the solution as a result of binding to the non-labeled nucleic acid competitor. The comparison of the ratio of complexed and free nicked oligonucleotides in the absence or presence of the competitor provides the concentration of HU bound to the non-labeled nucleic acid. Thus, the dissociation constant of the non-labeled nucleic acid can be calculated on the basis of the known parameters of the HU-nicked DNA interaction as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” As a control of this experimental approach, the same nicked DNA was used as a competitor of the labeled nicked DNA (Fig.1 A). The apparent dissociation constant of HU to nicked DNA found in this experiment is 12 nm, a value very close to the K d of 10 nm derived from the classical protein titration experiment (16Castaing B. Zelwer C. Laval J. Boiteux S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10291-10296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 17Kamashev D. Balandina A. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5434-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 18Pinson V. Takahashi M. Rouviere-Yaniv J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 485-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using this methodology, we successively measured the dissociation constants for linear and supercoiled DNAs, tRNA, and total RNA (Fig. 1 A). Based on the competition experiment, the apparent dissociation constant of HU to supercoiled DNA was estimated to be 450 nm under stringent conditions (200 mmNaCl, Fig. 1 A). Supercoiled plasmid was used as an example of genomic DNA. The plasmid was used after linearization to estimate the affinity of HU for linear DNA, and a value of K d = 1300 nm was obtained under the same high salt conditions. This apparent dissociation constant accounts for the cooperativity of HU binding and dissociation/association of HU monomers. Thus, HU protein binds supercoiled DNA 3× more strongly than linear DNA of the same length. This is in agreement with previous studies with HU chemical nuclease, which cleaves supercoiled DNA 2.5× faster than relaxed DNA (40Kobryn K. Lavoie B. Chaconas G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 777-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To investigate whether RNA may serve as a potential intracellular HU target, we isolated total bacterial RNA and estimated the affinity of HU using the same technique (Fig. 1 A). The apparent dissociation constant of 2500 nm was calculated as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). Likewise, the affinity of HU affinity to bulk E. coli tRNA was estimated to be 2200 nm. Thus, HU binds the major species of nucleic acids present in bacterial cells with a similar affinity. Finally the graph of bound nicked DNA versus the concentration of the different competitors (Fig. 1 B) shows that the concentration of the nucleic acids species required to reduce the bound nicked DNA corresponds well with the K d (Fig. 1 B). Double-stranded RNA and DNA as well as a DNA-RNA hybrid of 40 bp (all of the same sequence) were constructed. Their binding to HU was studied using the classical gel mobility shift assay. Fig.2 shows first that the gel mobilities of the duplexes of the three different types of nucleic acids (dsDNA, dsRNA, and DNA-RNA) are rather different, probably reflecting the different conformation of the three nucleic acids. These conformations seem to be sensitive to the salt conditions. At high salt the hybrid DNA-RNA migrates the fastest, whereas in low salt dsDNA is faster. Under both sets of conditions, duplex RNA is the most retarded matrix. In terms of binding to HU, under high salt conditions (200 mm NaCl) no complex was detectable with any duplex studied (Fig. 2 A). This was expected for dsDNA because under high salt conditions only a smear is visible because of the dissociation of nonspecific HU linear DNA complexes during their migration in the polyacrylamide gel (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In contrast, a defined complex could be isolated under low salt conditions with dsDNA having an apparent dissociation constant (K d ) of 450 nm for the first complex and a cooperativity of ω =K d1 /K d2 = 30. One HU dimer occupies 9 bp so that four HU complexes are formed with the 40-bp dsDNA (Fig. 2 B) (41Bonnefoy E. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 B also shows that four HU dimers can be accommodated similarly by 40-bp dsRNA and by the hybrid DNA-RNA. Thus, each HU dimer would cover 9–10 bp of dsRNA in a manner similar to the HU binding on dsDNA. The apparent dissociation constant of the first HU-dsRNA complex is 1800 nm. It is 4-fold higher than that for dsDNA, but the cooperativity of binding is 2.5× higher, ω = 70. Dissociation constants for the second complexesK d2 for dsDNA and RNA are 15 and 25 nm, respectively. The opposing differences in the dissociation constants for the first complexes and cooperativity suggest in fact that HU binds 1.6-fold stronger dsDNA than dsRNA. This result is in agreement with the ratio of affinities obtained in our competition studies performed under stringent salt conditions, which indicated that HU binds linear DNA twice as strongly as total RNA (Fig. 1). A 40-bp DNA-RNA hybrid of the same sequence was also checked for HU binding. Formation of four complexes with the 40-bp hybrid (and three complexes with 30-bp hybrid, data not shown) corresponds also to the binding model of one HU dimer to every 9–10 bp. The apparent dissociation constant of the first complex K d = 450 nm is the same as for dsDNA, the cooperativity being slightly higher, ω = 40. Thus, HU is able to bind dsDNA, dsRNA, and DNA-RNA hybrids with very similar affinities. The conformations of B-DNA and A-RNA are known to differ significantly, while DNA-RNA hybrids were shown to assume an intermediate A/B conformation (42Salazar M. Federoff O.Y. Miller J.M. Ribeiro S.N. Reid B.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4207-4215Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, HU seemed to recognize both the A and B conformations of RNA and DNA duplexes. This wide spectrum of binding can be explained by the high flexibility of HU arms (21White S.W. Wilson K.S. Appelt K. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HU does not recognize any particular DNA sequence, but it binds (under stringent conditions) with high affinity to some altered DNA structures. The simplest DNA structure that HU binds strongly even in the presence of excess of dsDNA competitor is either a DNA containing a single-stranded break (nicked DNA) or a DNA 3′-overhang (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The specificity of HU DNA binding was explained by the simultaneous interaction of the HU arms with the 5′ double-stranded part of the molecule and the interaction of HU body with the flexible 3′-branch, which can be either a double- or single-stranded DNA (19Kamashev D. Rouviere-Yaniv J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6527-6535Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Because we have seen that under low salt conditions HU binds an RNA-DNA hybrid with a similar affinity to which it binds DNA duplex (Fig. 2), we asked whether HU also could specifically recognize both nick and 3′-overhang structures in which one of the DNA strands is replaced with RNA. Both structures are of particular interest because they are DNA replication intermediates (43Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992: 475-491Google Scholar). In addition, the DNA-RNA 3′-overhang is involved in t"

It is assumed that the intermolecular β-sheet formed between I-strands and salt bridges at AB-loops play important roles in dimer formation. Several site-directed mutants in which intermolecular interactions stabilizing the dimer would be removed were expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris, and their monomer-dimer equilibria were studied by analytical ultracentrifugation.

By substituting either Asp33 or Arg40 on the AB-loop to oppositely charged residues (i.e. R40D, R40E, and D33R), a large decrease in K a was observed probably because of the charge repulsion, which is consistent with the role of electrostatic attraction between Arg40 on one monomer and Asp33 on the other monomer in the wild-type dimer. However, when two of these mutants, R40D and D33R, were mixed, a heterodimer was formed by the electrostatic attraction between Arg33 and Asp40 of different molecules.

Moreover, understanding protein-protein interactions would provide new insights to facilitatede novo design or novel approaches for the treatment of conformational diseases such as prion or Alzheimer's diseases in which protein-protein interactions play a key role. We have been studying the monomer-dimer equilibrium of β-lactoglobulin (β-LG)1as a model of protein-protein interaction (1Sakai K. Sakurai K. Sakai M. Hoshino M. Goto Y.

However, this property is not common to all β-LG variants. Many β-LG variants have been found in the milk of other mammals with the exception of humans, some of which (for example, equine and porcine β-LG) are known to exist as monomers at neutral pH even though their amino acid sequences and secondary structure topologies are highly conserved. There are several advantages to use of bovine β-LG as a model protein to study protein-protein interactions. (i) There have been many reports regarding the conformation of β-LG under various conditions. (ii) The range of association constant (K a ) observed for β-LG monomer-dimer equilibrium corresponds well with the measurable range for analytical ultracentrifugation (12Joss L.A. Ralston G.B. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 20-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). (iii) The crystal structure of β-LG dimer has been reported previously (6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 7Qin B.Y. Bewley M.C. Creamer L.K. Baker H.M. Baker E.N. Jameson G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14014-14023Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), thus the detailed structure of the dimer interface is available (Fig.1). With the x-ray dimer structure, we can calculate the thermodynamic parameters of monomer-dimer systems as reported previously (2Sakurai K. Oobatake M. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) or can predict the residues that are important for dimer formation. In this study, we investigated the monomer-dimer equilibrium of β-LG at neutral pH by preparing various mutants, which were classified as “structure-based mutants” and “sequence-based mutants.” The structure-based mutants were designed on the basis of the dimer interface seen in the crystal structure, consisting of two I-strands and two AB-loops. At the interface, four hydrogen bonds are formed among I-strands of each monomer (Fig. 1 D). In addition, eight hydrogen bonds are formed among AB-loops where it is assumed that the electrostatic attractions (i.e. salt bridges) between the positively charged Arg40 and negatively charged Asp33 play an important role (Fig. 1 C). The substitution of these residues responsible for hydrogen bonds or electrostatic interactions would lead to changes in the monomer-dimer behavior. On the other hand, the sequence-based mutants were designed by the sequence alignment of various β-LG species. Monomeric β-LG variants have been detected in other species such as equine (14Ikeguchi M. Kato S. Shimazu A. Sugai S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) or porcine β-LG (15Perez M.D Puyol P Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A comparison of the amino acid sequences between bovine β-LG and those of these other species indicated some mismatches, several of which are positioned on or near the dimer interface of bovine β-LG (3Sawyer L. Kontopidis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was expected that the substitution of the mismatched residues to those of equine or porcine β-LG might cause the dissociation of the dimer. We prepared various structure-based and sequence-based β-LG mutants and measured the effects of mutations on the monomer-dimer equilibrium monitored by analytical ultracentrifugation. As expected, some mutants showed marked decreases in association constant (K a ) with no changes in the global fold. The relationship between the mutation site and its effect onK a suggested that although I-strands contribute to dimer formation by intermolecular β-sheet formation, AB-loops do so by electrostatic attraction between Arg40 and Asp33. Consistent with this finding, the AB-loop mutants R40D, R40E, and D33R, which had lost the ability to form homodimers because of the charge repulsion at the dimer interface, formed heterodimers by interacting with monomers with the opposite charges,i.e. R40D and D33R or R40E and D33R. Escherichia coli XL-I Blue was used as the host strain to construct vectors. The expression vector used was pPIC11, which is almost the same as pPIC9 with the exception of the presence of the ori region of the pUC plasmid. Plasmid pPIC11 containing the β-LG sequence (β-LG/pPIC11), prepared previously by the method of Kim et al. (16Kim T.-R. Goto Y. Hirota N. Kuwata K. Denton H., Wu, S.-Y. Sawyer L. Batt C.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1339-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used as the source of wild-type β-LG gene for site-directed mutagenesis. Pichia pastoris GS115(his4) (Invitrogen) was used as the host strain for protein expression (17Cregg J.M. Barringer K.J. Hessler A.Y. Madden K.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3376-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). All of the media used for E. coli and P. pastoriswere prepared as described by Kim et al. (16Kim T.-R. Goto Y. Hirota N. Kuwata K. Denton H., Wu, S.-Y. Sawyer L. Batt C.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1339-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extraction of plasmid DNA from E. coli cells was performed using a Wizard Plus Miniprep kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Digested plasmid DNA or PCR products were purified as described previously (16Kim T.-R. Goto Y. Hirota N. Kuwata K. Denton H., Wu, S.-Y. Sawyer L. Batt C.A. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1339-1345Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced into plasmid β-LG/pPIC11 by two methods. First, we attempted site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In cases in which we could not introduce the mutations into the plasmid, we used the overlap extension method (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6809) Google Scholar). To confirm introduction of the mutation, we checked the entire sequence of the β-LG gene on the plasmid using an Applied Biosystems Model 310 sequencer (Foster City, CA). The plasmid obtained by gene manipulation described above was nicked using the restriction enzyme AatI (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) for transformation of P. pastoris strain GS115. After electroporation using a E. coli pulser (Bio-Rad) at a voltage of 1.7 kV, the cells were spread on RD plate medium containing no His to select transformants. The obtained transformants were cultured on a small scale to check their protein expression. The expression quantity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the strain with the highest level of protein expression was used for mass culture in a KMJ-2C jar fermentor (Mitsuwa, Osaka, Japan). Cell and culture media were separated by centrifugation, and the supernatant (1 liter) was filtered using Millex-SV with a pore diameter of 5 μm (Millipore, Bedford, MA) to remove dust or small particles. The filtered supernatant was diluted to 5 liters, and the pH was adjusted to 2.5–4.0 by adding concentrated hydrochloric acid. The supernatant then was passed through a CM-Sepharose column equilibrated with 50 mm Gly-HCl buffer (pH 2.5–3.5) or 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) to adsorb expressed β-LG mutants. For some mutants, the appropriate pH conditions were determined by a batch method. β-LG mutants were eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl. The β-LG mutant fraction was collected and dialyzed against 4 mm HCl. The dialyzed β-LG mutant solution was lyophilized. If the sample contained heterogeneous materials, the CM-Sepharose process was repeated. Purified β-LG mutants were checked by SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy. All samples gave a single band on SDS-PAGE, and the molecular weight was within 0.1% error of the value calculated from the sequence. Far-UV and near-UV CD spectra of the β-LG mutants were measured with a Jasco J-720WI spectropolarimeter at 20 °C controlled with a Peltier thermostat (Jasco PTC-348WI). The buffer used was 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 20 mm NaCl. Near UV CD spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of ∼1.8 mg/ml using a 5-mm quartz cell, whereas far-UV spectra were obtained at a protein concentration of ∼0.11 mg/ml using a 2-mm cell. The CD spectra shown are averages of four measurements. The extinction coefficients of the mutants were calculated from amino acid sequences by the method of Gill and von Hippel (19Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5034) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge to investigate the K a of β-LG mutants under the same conditions as the CD measurements. Sample preparation and data acquisition were performed by the same way as described in a previous study (2Sakurai K. Oobatake M. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The protein concentration (C T) versus radius (r) plots were analyzed to determine K a according to the theoretical equation for monomer-dimer equilibrium in Equation 1 CT=CM(r0)exp[Mφ(r2−r02)]Equation 1 +(2Ka/M)[CM(r0)]2exp[2Mφ(r2−r02)]where r 0 is arbitrary radius point, andC M(r 0) is the monomer concentration at r 0, M is the molecular weight of monomer, φ = ω2(1 − νρ)/(2RT), and R, T, and ω are the gas constant, absolute temperature, and rotor speed, respectively (20Teller D.C. Horbett T.A. Richards E.G. Schachman H.K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1969; 164: 66-101Crossref Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The measurements at three different protein concentrations under the same buffer conditions were carried out using a rotor with three cells, and the results at different concentrations were analyzed by global fitting using Equation 1. Least squares curve fitting was performed using the Igor software program (Wave- Metrics, Lake Oswego, OR). Sedimentation equilibrium data of a solution containing two β-LG mutants were analyzed assuming homodimer and heterodimer formation in Equation 2CT=[CA(r0)+CB(r0)]exp[Mφ(r2−r02)]+Equation 2 (2/M){KAA[CA(r0)]2+KBB[CB(r0)]2+KAB[CA(r0)CB(r0)]}exp[2Mφ(r2−r02)]where subscripts A and B refer to respective mutants,K AA and K BB are the association constants of homodimers, and K AB is the association constant of the heterodimer. Gel-filtration HPLC analysis was performed with a TSK-Gel S3000WXL column (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) at room temperature. The buffer used was 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, and the flow rate was 0.4 ml/min. The aliquots of 20–40 μl of sample solutions at 100 μm (1.86 mg/ml) dissolved in the buffer were applied. Mutant proteins, their expression yields, and results of ultracentrifugation measurements are summarized in Table I. Mutant proteins were classified into sequence-based and structure-based mutants. Sequence-based mutants were designed based on the sequence alignment of dimeric bovine and monomeric equine (14Ikeguchi M. Kato S. Shimazu A. Sugai S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and porcine (15Perez M.D Puyol P Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) β-LG species. On the other hand, structure-based mutants were designed by examining the dimer interface of the bovine β-LG x-ray structure (3Sawyer L. Kontopidis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar,6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). The structure-based mutants were further classified into AB-loop mutants and βI-strand mutants. For all of the mutants designed in this study, fairly good expression yields were obtained.Table IAssociation constants of mutants determined by ultracentrifugation K aStateYieldm −1 mg/literWild-type2.03 × 105Dimer190Sequence-based mutant A34S2.31 × 105Dimer72 A34T8.25 × 104Dimer181 R40K6.00 × 104Dimer65 W61G1.35 × 104In between37 W61R3.76 × 105Dimer125Structure-based mutant AB loopD33A2.31 × 105Dimer50D28A/D33A5.08 × 105Dimer125D33R4.21 × 103Monomer81R40M2.04 × 103Monomer129R40D3.65 × 103Monomer402R40E7.70 × 103Monomer75 I-strandH146P8.42 × 102Monomer1020R148A9.20 × 104Dimer91R148PND1-aND, not determined because of the limits of sedimentation equilibrium analysis.Monomer86S150P1.76 × 103Monomer143Heterodimerization D33R + R40D1.88 × 105Dimer D33R + R40E3.86 × 105Dimer1-a ND, not determined because of the limits of sedimentation equilibrium analysis. Open table in a new tab The far-UV CD spectrum of wild-type β-LG was characteristic of a β-sheet protein, consistent with a predominantly β-sheet structure as shown by x-ray and NMR analyses (Fig.2). The near-UV CD spectrum of wild-type β-LG had two characteristic negative peaks of ∼290 nm, representing a unique tertiary structure. Far- and near-UV CD spectra of each mutant were similar to those of wild-type β-LG with the exception of some mutants for which slight differences were seen in peak wavelength or intensity. From these spectra, we assumed that all of the mutants had almost the same native structure as wild-type β-LG. The results of ultracentrifugation measurements for each mutant are shown in Fig.3 and Table I. The K a of wild-type β-LG (2.0 × 105m−1) is not very high as a value for monomer-dimer equilibrium of protein-protein interaction, and the fractions of dimer at protein concentrations of 1 and 0.1 mg/ml are 80 and 51%, respectively. This relatively low K a is related to the small area of the dimer interface (see “Discussion”). Therefore, subtle changes in the dimer interface appeared to affect critically the monomer-dimer equilibrium by changing the K a . Among the three types of mutants, sequence-based mutants showed only slight decreases in K a , indicating that dimer stabilization cannot be ascribed to those interface residues of bovine β-LG that differed from the monomeric β-LG species. In contrast, some of the AB-loop and I-strand mutants showed significant decreases in K a . All Pro-introduced I-strand mutants (H146P, R148P, and S150P) showed a marked decrease in K a , leading to the dissociation of the dimer. Because Pro is known to be a breaker of β-sheets, these results indicated that the introduced Pro residues disrupted the intermolecular β-sheet. In contrast, Ala-introduced mutant (R148A) showed little change in K a , suggesting that the charge repulsion of Arg148 on both I-strands does not have a functional role. As electrostatic interactions (i.e. salt bridges) between Asp33 and Arg40 are assumed to be important for dimer formation, we substituted these residues with neutral (D33A and R40M) or oppositely charged residues (D33R, R40D, and R40E). The conversion of Asp33 or Arg40 to the oppositely charged residue decreased K a . These results indicated that electrostatic repulsion at residues 33 and 40 is unfavorable for dimer formation, further suggesting that the electrostatic attraction between Asp33 and Arg40 contributes to the stabilization of the wild-type dimer. Provided that there are favorable electrostatic attractions between negatively charged Asp33 and positively charged Arg40, the mutation of either of these two residues to a neutral residue would destabilize the dimer. In fact, D33A and R40M showed contrasting results. Whereas R40M showed a decrease inK a , D33A did not. Because Asp28 is located close to Asp33 in the x-ray crystal structure, it was assumed that D33A mutant could form a dimer via Arg40-Asp28 interaction instead of Arg40-Asp33 interaction. However, this explanation was not validated, because even the D28A/D33A mutant did not show a decrease in K a (see “Discussion”). If the electrostatic interactions between Asp33 and Arg40 are important for the stabilization of the β-LG dimer, it was anticipated that D33R and R40D, which could not form a homodimer, would form a heterodimer in which the AB-loops with opposite charges would interact attractively. First, ultracentrifugation was carried out to detect heterodimer formation. Sedimentation equilibrium data for a mixture of D33R and R40D indicated that the apparent molecular weight without assuming oligomer formation was close to that of the dimer. Because neither of these mutants could form dimers by themselves, it was likely that the high molecular weight component was a heterodimer of the two mutants. To estimate the K a value of the heterodimer, we analyzed the sedimentation equilibrium data with Equation 2 in which three types of monomer-dimer equilibria were considered. Assuming that the homodimeric K a values of D33R and R40D were the same as those measured independently for these mutants, we estimated the heterodimeric K a to be 1.9 × 105m−1 (Table I). Similar heterodimerization was also observed for a mixture of D33R and R40E with the heterodimeric K a value of 3.9 × 105m−1. TheseK a values were comparable with that of wild-type β-LG (2.0 × 105m−1), showing that the dimerization ability, once lost upon the introduction of the electrostatic repulsion on AB-loops, was recovered by forming a heterodimer with complementary charges (Fig. 5). Second, the heterodimer formation was examined by gel-filtration HPLC. We reported previously that β-LG monomer and dimer can be separated by gel-filtration HPLC; the β-LG monomer eluted more slowly than the dimer (21Yamasaki R. Hoshino M. Wazawa T. Ishii Y. Yanagida T. Kawata Y. Higurashi T. Sakai K. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Heterodimer formations between D33R and R40D or between D33R and R40E were examined (Fig.4). To prevent unfavorable electrostatic interactions between proteins and the silica matrix of column, the salt concentration of buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl) was slightly higher than that used for ultracentrifugation (20 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm NaCl). We confirmed that this difference in salt concentration did not notably affect the K a value of wild-type and mutant β-LG measured by ultracentrifugation. A mixture of D33R and R40D at a molar ratio of 1:1 eluted faster than either mutant applied separately, and moreover, the retention time for the mixture was close to that of wild-type β-LG (Fig. 4 A). This finding indicated that D33R and R40D formed a heterodimer when mixed. To examine the stoichiometry of complex formation, we further increased the amount of D33R with a fixed amount of R40D (Fig.4 B). When the molar ratio of D33R exceeded that of R40D, a peak of monomer appeared as indicated by the arrow in Fig.4 B, and its intensity seemed to represent the excess amount of D33R. The opposite results were obtained when the amount of R40D was varied at a fixed amount of D33R. The elution peaks were deconvoluted to obtain the fractions of monomer and dimer (Fig.4 C). These results indicated that D33R and R40D form a 1:1 complex, and the excess amount of either species, D33R or R40D, eluted separately as a monomer. Similar results were obtained for a combination of D33R and R40E (Fig. 4 D), indicating that D33R can form a heterodimer with both R40D and R40E. Whereas bovine β-LG exists as a dimer at neutral pH, equine and porcine β-LG exist as monomers (14Ikeguchi M. Kato S. Shimazu A. Sugai S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 27: 567-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 15Perez M.D Puyol P Ena J.M. Calvo M. J. Dairy Res. 1993; 60: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). X-ray structures suggest that the dimer is stabilized by two I-strands and two AB-loops where hydrogen bonds, electrostatic attraction, and hydrophobic interactions play roles (Fig.1). However, the dimer interface buries only ∼1200 Å2 of the accessible surface area per dimer, corresponding to ∼6% of the total surface area of the isolated native structure. This value lies at the lower end of the range for strongly associated dimers (6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), consistent with the relatively low value of K a of wild-type β-LG. Thus, the mutation of the residues at the interface was expected to critically affect the monomer-dimer equilibrium. To convert dimeric bovine β-LG to the monomeric form, we chose two approaches. By sequence-based mutation, we substituted the residues on or near the dimer interface on the basis of sequence comparison with equine and porcine β-LG (3Sawyer L. Kontopidis G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1482: 136-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar, 6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). However, little changes inK a were seen. Recently, to convert monomeric horse β-LG to dimeric β-LG (an idea opposite to ours), Kobayashi, Ikeguchi, and Sugai (Soka University, Hachioji, Japan) prepared mutants in which the AB-loop and I-strand residues of horse β-LG were mutated to those of bovine β-LG. 2T. Kobayashi, M. Ikeguchi, and S. Sugai, personal communication. Contrary to their expectations, these mutants did not form a dimer. Taken together, the difference in monomer-dimer behavior between bovine β-LG and equine/porcine β-LG cannot be explained simply by the sequence differences at the dimer interface. On the other hand, our structure-based mutation approach successfully yielded several monomeric bovine β-LG mutants. The distortion or breaking of either the intermolecular β-sheet at I-strands or electrostatic interactions at AB-loops markedly destabilized the dimer without affecting the overall folding of β-LG as measured by CD. The importance of electrostatic interactions at AB-loops was further demonstrated by the formation of heterodimers between the two mutants,i.e. D33R and R40D or D33R and R40E, in which electrostatic repulsion was converted to electrostatic attraction (Fig.5). In our previous study (2Sakurai K. Oobatake M. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), we characterized the thermodynamics of the salt- and temperature-dependent monomer-dimer equilibria of bovine β-LG at pH 3.0. Based on a comparison of the observed negative heat capacity change upon dimer formation that calculated from the x-ray dimer structure, we proposed that both the non-polar and polar interactions are responsible for dimer formation, although the contribution of the non-polar interaction to the heat capacity change is greater than that of the polar interaction. The present results confirmed the participation of electrostatic interactions in dimer formation. Thus, the dimer of bovine β-LG is stabilized by the sum of various forces including overall hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds at I-strands, and electrostatic attractions (i.e. salt bridges) as well as the consequent hydrogen bonds at AB-loops. Nevertheless, total energy stabilizing the dimer is still marginal because of the fairly small area of interaction. This results in the marked change in monomer-dimer equilibrium by point mutations as observed here. It should be noted, however, that the K a values of some mutants, in particular those of AB-loop mutants, were inconsistent with the simple argument on the basis of the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic effects. For example, whereas R40M showed a decrease inK a as expected from the positive role of salt bridges between Arg40 and Asp33, D33A did not. These inconsistencies are probably related to marked structural changes of the mutants. One possible reason why D33A showed no decrease inK a is that compensating interaction was created upon the loss of the electrostatic interaction between Arg40 and Asp33 by changing the interfacial coordinates. Such phenomena were reported in other protein-protein complexes such as barnase-barster and lysozyme-antibody complexes (22Vaoughan C.K. Buckle A.M. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 1487-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Chacko S. Silverton E. Kam-Morgan L. Smith-Gill S. Cohen G. Davies D. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) where cavities created upon mutation were filled by water molecules to make new hydrogen bonds or to restore the interfacial packing. Thus, clarifying the x-ray structures of mutant proteins will be necessary to understand the effects of Asp33 mutations in detail. Moreover, the x-ray structures will be important to understand the roles of various forces, i.e. hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions, in determining the monomer-dimer equilibrium as has been addressed for the stability of monomeric proteins (24Takano K. Tsuchimori K. Yamagata Y. Yutani K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 12375-12381Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). X-ray structures of heterodimers are of particular importance to demonstrate the roles of electrostatic interactions. We successfully reformed the β-LG dimer by mixing mutants with complementary charges, none of which could form homodimers alone because of charge repulsion. Although there have been many studies of the complex dissociation or attenuation of interactions by mutagenesis, there have been few reports regarding the generation of new specific interactions by inducing mutations into both components of complexes. One such report was concerned with human growth hormone (hGH) and its receptor (hGHbp) (25Atwell S. Ultsch M., De Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this previous study (25Atwell S. Ultsch M., De Vos A.M. Wells J.A. Science. 1997; 278: 1125-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), hGH with a single mutation that prevented binding to wild-type hGHbp showed the restoration of binding ability by five point mutations in hGHbp, which resulted in the repacking of the interface. In the present study, the recovery of dimer formation was induced by a single point mutation in each monomer. This was probably related to the fact that the interface of β-LG dimer is relatively small (2Sakurai K. Oobatake M. Goto Y. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 2325-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Brownlow S. Cabral J.H.M. Cooper R. Flower D.R. Yewdall S.J. Polikarpov I. North A.C.T. Sawyer L. Structure. 1997; 5: 481-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and only a small number of residues are responsible for the interactions at the interface. Therefore, we consider the β-LG dimer to be an ideal model for studying protein-protein interaction. The results of this study demonstrated how bovine β-LG dimers are stabilized by various interactions at the dimer interface. The intermolecular β-sheet formed between I-strands plays an important role in positioning each monomer for proper dimer assembly. Two charged residues in the AB-loop (Asp33 and Arg40) supply additional geometrical restrictions for dimer formation. Together with the energetic gain caused by the electrostatic interactions as well as the gain by the hydrophobic interactions, the dimer interface with specific geometry is stabilized. The dimer interaction is so marginal that it is easily destroyed by modifying either of these interactions, for example, by changing the electrostatic attraction at the AB-loop to electrostatic repulsion. Intriguingly, the two mutants with opposite charge repulsion at the AB-loop can form a heterodimer. These observations may provide new ideas to facilitate protein engineering and de novo design and will help in understanding protein complex formation and aggregation phenomena such as gelation and amyloidosis."

In vivo Ang II is degraded to bioactive peptides, including Ang III (angiotensin-(2–8)) and Ang IV (angiotensin-(3–8)). These peptides stimulate inositol phosphate generation in human AT1 receptor expressing CHO-K1 cells, but the potency of Ang IV is very low. Substitution of Asn111 with glycine, which is known to cause constitutive receptor activation by disrupting its interaction with the seventh transmembrane helix (TM VII), selectively increased the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and angiotensin-(4–8), and leads to partial agonism of angiotensin-(5–8). Consistent with the need for the interaction between Arg2 of Ang II and Ang III with Asp281, substitution of this residue with alanine (D281A) decreased the peptide's potency without affecting that of Ang IV. All effects of the D281A mutation were superseded by the N111G mutation. The increased affinity of Ang IV to the N111G mutant was also demonstrated by binding studies. A model is proposed in which the Arg2-Asp281 interaction causes a conformational change in TM VII of the receptor, which, similar to the N111G mutation, eliminates the constraining intramolecular interaction between Asn111 and TM VII.

The majority of these effects involved in the regulation of the hydromineral balance as well as arterial blood pressure are mediated by AT1 receptors (1De Gasparo M. Catt K.J. Inagami T. Wright J.W. Unger T. Pharmacol. Rev. 2000; 52: 15-72Google Scholar). Although Ang II is considered to be the main effector of the renin-angiotensin system, other angiotensin peptides are also capable of exerting biological effects. Removal of the N-terminal amino acid (Asp1) of Ang II results in the formation of Ang III. Ang III is a potent agonist of the AT1 receptor, and was suggested to be the predominant effector peptide in the brain (2Reaux A. Fournie-Zaluski M.C.F. Llorens-Cortes C. Trends Endocrinol.

Removal of one more amino acid (Arg2) from Ang III leads to the formation of Ang IV, which binds with high affinity to the “AT4 receptor,” which is pharmacologically distinct from the AT1 and AT2 receptors (1De Gasparo M.

In this context mutation-induced constitutive activation has been exploited to study the residues involved in the receptor activation process either by direct interaction with Ang II or by participating in intramolecular interaction networks that stabilize inactive receptor conformations (7Balmforth A.J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). An important advance was realized by the identification of Asn111, located in TM III of the AT1receptor, to be implicated in the process of receptor activation (7Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Warburton P. Donnelly D. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4245-4251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar,10Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Substitution of Asn111 by Gly was reported to cause partial ligand-independent/constitutive activation of the receptor. It has been proposed that this amino acid interacts with Tyr292 in TM VII in the non-activated receptor and that activation of the receptor would disrupt this interaction allowing Tyr292 to interact with Asp74 (10Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1822-1826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Asn111 has also been suggested to interact with Asn295 in TM VII (7Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Warburton P. Donnelly D. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4245-4251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), but other studies argue against the role of Asn295 in stabilizing the inactive conformation of the receptor (9Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 11Hunyady L., Ji, H. Jagadeesh G. Zhang M. Gaborik Z. Mihalik B. Catt K.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the role of Asn111 in the stabilization of the inactive conformation of the receptor by interacting with residue(s) in TM VII is generally accepted (12Hunyady L. Gáborik Z. Vauquelin G. Catt K.J. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2001; 2: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Noda et al. (13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) proposed that formation of the active receptor conformation (R*) requires two distinct Ang II-dependent steps (R-R′-R*). In this model, Tyr4 of Ang II plays an important role during the initial rate-limiting step (conversion of R into R′) by interacting with Asn111 and releasing it from its constraining intramolecular interaction with TM VII. Phe8 of Ang II was also proposed to be involved during this initial step (9Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and it is widely accepted that the N111G constitutive active receptor adopts this partially active conformation. In the second step other distinct structural features of angiotensin II cause the stabilization of the fully activated state of the receptor (R*). The interaction between Arg2 and Asp281 located in TM VII of the AT1 receptor is necessary for the high affinity binding of angiotensin peptide ligands (14Feng Y.H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X.P. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In the present study we have investigated the interaction between different angiotensin peptides and wild type, partially activated (N111G) and Asp281 mutant (D281A) AT1 receptors to study the role of Asp1 and Arg2 during receptor activation. It is shown that Arg2 is only implied during the initial step of agonist-induced activation of the receptor and that Ang IV is a full and potent agonist for the N111G constitutive active receptor. The human AT1 receptor gene, cloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), was used for expression and mutagenesis. The mutation of Asn111 to Gly, Asp281 to Ala, or their combination was created by the polymerase chain reaction method using the Mutagene kit (Bio-Rad). The DNA sequence of mutated receptor was confirmed by dideoxynucleotide sequencing (AmershamBiosciences). The wild type and the mutated receptors were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells and cultured as described previously (15Fierens F. Vanderheyden P. Gaborik Z., Le Minh T. DeBacker J.P. Hunyady L. Yzerman A. Vauquelin G. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2000; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were labeled for 20 h with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol (Amersham Biosciences). The labeled cells were washed twice with DMEM medium and incubated with this medium containing 10 mm LiCl for 15 min. Then agonists were added, and the incubation was continued for another 15 min at 37 °C. At the end of incubation, the medium was removed, and the total soluble inositol phosphate (IP) was extracted from the cells as described previously (15Fierens F. Vanderheyden P. Gaborik Z., Le Minh T. DeBacker J.P. Hunyady L. Yzerman A. Vauquelin G. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2000; 1: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The amount of [3H]IP eluted from the column was counted and a concentration-response curve generated using non-linear regression analysis. DiVal Ang IV was synthesized by Dr. G. Munske (Washington State University). Competition binding experiments were carried out at 37 °C for 1 h on intact adherent cells as described previously (16Vanderheyden P.M.L. Fierens F.L.P., De Backer J.P. Frayman N. Vauquelin G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) using 1.5 nm[3H]candesartan (for the wild type and D281A mutant receptor) or 5 nm [3H]candesartan (for the N111G and N111G/D281A mutant receptor). The equilibrium dissociation rate constant of [3H]candesartan was determined by non-regression analysis using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA) of saturation binding curves (at a concentration range between 0.15 and 15 nm) for the N111G and N111G/D281A receptors or of association and dissociation curves for the wild type and D281A receptors (at a radioligand concentration of 1.5 nm). [3H]Candesartan (17 Ci/mmol) was obtained from AstraZeneca. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled candesartan. Monoiodinated [125I]Ang IV was a kind gift of Prof. G. Slegers (Radiopharmacy Department, University of Ghent). The [125I]Ang IV binding assay was carried out similarly, and non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 1 μm unlabeled Ang IV. Wild type human AT1 receptors and mutant receptors, in which Asn111 was replaced by glycine (N111G), Asp281 was replaced by alanine (D281A), or in which both replacements were combined, were transiently expressed in CHO-K1 cells. Their function was assessed by measuring the inositol phosphate accumulation. The higher basal level of inositol phosphates in cells with the N111G and the double mutated receptor agrees with previous findings (7Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Warburton P. Donnelly D. Ball S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4245-4251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Groblewski T. Maigret B. Larguier R. Lombard C. Bonnafous J.C. Marie J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig 1and Table I, Ang II and its N-terminal amino acid-deleted fragment Ang III were almost equipotent agonists for the wild type receptor. Ang IV (deletion of two N-terminal amino acids) and DiVal Ang IV were full agonists but with much weaker potency. On the other hand the C-terminal pentapeptide angiotensin-(4–8) was barely active and the tetrapeptide angiotensin-(5–8) was completely inactive at concentrations up to 100 μm. The N111G substitution only minimally affected the stimulatory properties of Ang II and Ang III, but it produced a dramatic increase in the potency of Ang IV (900-fold) and of DiVal Ang IV (1500-fold) (Table I). Concentration-response curves of these four investigated agonists were now alike for the N111G-mutated AT1 receptor. The potency of angiotensin-(4–8) also increased dramatically, and it became a full agonist with a somewhat lower potency (EC50 = 28.3 nm) compared with Ang II. On the other hand, angiotensin-(5–8), which lacks the important Tyr4 residue, was only a very weak and partial agonist for the N111G-mutated receptor (Fig. 1). In parallel, the binding affinities of Ang II, Ang III, Ang IV, and DiVal Ang IV were investigated by competition binding experiments with the highly potent and AT1receptor-selective antagonist [3H]candesartan. Association, dissociation, and saturation binding experiments revealed that candesartan has 100 times lower affinity for the N111G-mutated receptor as compared with the wild type receptor. In agreement with the functional data, the binding affinity of the investigated angiotensin-related peptides was increased for the N111G-substituted receptor. Whereas only a relative weak increase in affinity was seen for Ang II and Ang III, a substantial rightward shift of the competition curves occurred for Ang IV and DiVal Ang IV (Table I). Furthermore, specific binding of [125I]Ang IV was only measurable in N111G-mutated but not in wild type AT1receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 2).Table ILigand binding and activation properties of the wild type and mutant AT 1 receptorsInositol phosphate production, EC50Wild typeN111GN111G/D281AD281A nmAng II1.55 ± 0.321.20 ± 0.282.29 ± 0.2852 ± 20Ang III3.43 ± 1.053.78 ± 1.142.13 ± 0.11228 ± 44Ang IV1244 ± 1701.39 ± 0.251.51 ± 0.432590 ± 835DiVal Ang IV4162 ± 7082.64 ± 0.561.47 ± 1.528352 ± 604[3H]Candesartan competition binding, K i nmAng II13.9 ± 3.21.08 ± 0.231.44 ± 0.96>1000Ang III18.2 ± 0.93.38 ± 0.643.07 ± 0.25>1000Ang IV>100014.5 ± 3.411.3 ± 3.4>1000DiVal Ang IV>100041.4 ± 5.594.2 ± 20.9>1000Candesartan0.053 ± 0.0075.58 ± 0.805.40 ± 0.040.18 ± 0.09EC50 values of concentration-inositol phosphate response curves of Ang II and the indicated peptides in CHO-K1 cells expressing the wild type, N111G, D281A, or N111G/D281 A-mutated human AT1receptors.

All values represent the average ± S.E. of minimally three independent experiments performed in duplicate. The impact of the D281A mutation on binding and function of the angiotensin related peptides was examined. The concentration-response curves for Ang IV and DiVal Ang IV were only modestly affected by the D281A substitution (Fig. 1). [3H]Candesartan binding (Table I) was also only marginally affected by this mutation. On the other hand, the concentration-response curves of the Ang II and Ang III were shifted to the right by 33- and 66-fold, respectively, and their potency was also markedly reduced in competition binding experiments. The effects of the D281A substitution could be completely reversed by the N111G mutation. The functional properties of the angiotensin peptides as well as their binding affinities were the same in N111G/D281A when compared with the single N111G substitution. Insight into the molecular mechanism by which Ang II activates the AT1 receptor has been gained by structure-activity relationship studies with peptide analogs as well as receptor mutants. In this context Arg2 as well as the aromatic residues Tyr4 and Phe8 of Ang II have essential roles in the binding and receptor activation (12Hunyady L. Gáborik Z. Vauquelin G. Catt K.J. J. Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst. 2001; 2: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 17Miura S. Feng Y.H. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 28511-28514Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Measuring inositol phosphate production in human AT1 receptor-expressing CHO-K1 cells, we show that the N111G mutation produces a dramatic increase in the potency of Ang IV and DiVal Ang IV, while only causing a moderate increase in the potency of Ang II and Ang III. In this way, all four peptides become similarly potent agonists. Moreover the C-terminal pentapeptide angiotensin-(4–8) displays very little activity at the wild type receptor at the concentration range tested, but it becomes a full agonist for the N111G-mutated receptor. It is likely that the large increase in agonist activity of angiotensin-(4–8) on the N111G mutant receptor was also caused by an increase in potency, since earlier studies have demonstrated that at very high concentrations angiotensin-(4–8) is a full agonist of the AT1 receptor in adrenal glomerulosa cells (20Parnot C. Bardin S. Miserey-Lenkei S. Guedin D. Corvol P. Clauser E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 97: 7615-7620Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The somewhat lower potency of angiotensin-(4–8) to stimulate the N111G mutant receptor compared with that of Ang II, Ang III, and Ang IV may indicate that Val3 of the ligand is auxiliary for optimal agonist binding. On the other hand angiotensin-(5–8) only became a very weak and partial agonist for the mutated receptor. In the same line, competition binding studies with the AT1receptor-selective antagonist [3H]candesartan reveal that the N111G mutation increases the affinity of Ang IV and DiVal Ang IV, and the mutated receptor can now directly be detected by binding of [125I]Ang IV. Since the conformation of the receptor in its preactivated state is mimicked by the N111G mutant, the present data suggest that Ang IV and angiotensin-(4–8) are capable of converting the preactivated state into a fully activated conformation, but that they lack the mechanism required for the preactivation itself. The considerable lower potency and efficacy of angiotensin-(5–8) to activate the preactivated state highlights the importance of Tyr4 of Ang II in the process of AT1 receptor activation (13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). These findings are also in agreement with a previous study dealing with the aldosterone production by adrenal glomerulosa cells, which were induced by Ang IV and angiotensin-(4–8), but not by angiotensin-(5–8) that lacks the Tyr4 (19Capponi A.M. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5120-5127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The higher potency of all agonists, including angiotensin-(5–8), in this study as compared with the present one could be related to a large amount of spare receptors in the adrenal glomerulosa cells (19Capponi A.M. Catt K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 5120-5127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but not in AT1 receptor-expressing CHO-K1 cells (16Vanderheyden P.M.L. Fierens F.L.P., De Backer J.P. Frayman N. Vauquelin G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 1057-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The weak potency of Ang IV and angiotensin-(4–8) to preactivate the wild type receptor is caused by the absence of Arg2, because Ang III (which is only different from Ang IV in this residue) is a fully potent agonist. On the other hand Asp1 of Ang II is not involved in this process, since Ang III displays the same characteristics both for the wild type and the mutant receptor. This observation is in agreement with previous findings indicating that Asp1 of Ang II is not required for agonism and only weakly interacts with amino acid residues such as His183 of the receptor (14Feng Y.H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X.P. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Noda et al. (13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) have proposed that full activation of the AT1 receptor is preceded by the formation of a preactivated state. It was also suggested that the N111G mutation mimics the preactivated state of the receptor, because it impedes the interaction of Asn111 with TM VII that stabilizes the inactive conformation and, as a consequence, produces constitutive activation (13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To explain our findings and previous data we propose that Arg2 of Ang II plays an important role in this preactivation process or, in other words, that Arg2participates in the destabilization of the receptor's inactive conformation. This preactivation goes along with the opening of a transmembrane pocket, which provides optimal binding of the C-terminal amino acids. Furthermore, our model shows that once the receptor is in this preactivated state, the five C-terminal amino acids contain the structural features that are necessary for full receptor activation. The present model, which is illustrated in Fig.3, implies that while Arg2 is necessary for the high affinity binding of peptide ligands to the wild type receptor, it is not mandatory for full receptor activation. Indeed, Ang IV is a full agonist, and its low potency suggests that receptor preactivation can occur spontaneously even in the absence of Arg2. To further evaluate the role of Arg2 of Ang II, mutant AT1 receptors were created based on the assumption that this amino acid interacts with Asp281 located at the extracellular end of TM VII of the receptor (14Feng Y.H. Noda K. Saad Y. Liu X.P. Husain A. Karnik S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12846-12850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Both our functional and binding studies on Asp281 to alanine mutated receptor are in agreement with this proposal and previous findings. When measuring inositol phosphate production, this mutation caused a 33-fold and 66-fold increase of the EC50 of Ang II and Ang III and, likewise, a dramatic reduction in their affinity in competition binding studies. As expected, the D281A mutation had only marginal effect on the potency of Ang IV and DiVal Ang IV. Our proposal that the Arg2-Asp281 interaction is only necessary during receptor preactivation is further supported by findings with a receptor in which the N111G mutation is combined with the D281A mutation. Compared with the single D281A mutation, this double mutation rescues the impaired binding affinity and potency of Ang II and Ang III. It also produces a dramatic increase in the affinity and potency of Ang IV compared with the wild type or D281A mutant receptor. The N111G/D281A double mutant receptor not only displays the same agonist binding characteristics as the constitutively active N111G mutant, it also increases basal inositol phosphates production (data not shown), which is characteristic for the preactivated state of the receptor. Taken together, preactivation of the receptor by Ang II may involve the disruption of the Asn111-TM VII interaction along with the binding of Arg2 of the peptide to Asp281 to stabilize the new receptor conformation. Because the Asn111-TM VII interaction is already disrupted by the N111G mutation, this receptor mutant does not require Arg2 to adopt the preactivated state. Asn111 is likely to play a dual role. It stabilizes the inactive conformation of the receptor by interacting with TM VII, and it also interacts with Tyr4 of the ligand during the process of receptor preactivation. When the receptor is preactivated this latter interaction is probably no longer required to obtain full receptor activation, since Noda et al. (13Noda K. Feng Y.H. Liu X.P. Saad Y. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16435-16442Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) demonstrated that [Sar1,Ile4,Ile8]Ang II (where Sar indicates sarcosine) cannot activate the wild type receptor while being an agonist of the N111G mutant receptor. Altered antagonist binding is characteristic of constitutive active AT1 receptors (7Balmforth A.J. Lee A.J. Warburton P. Donnelly D. Ball S.G. J. Biol.

A. 2001; 97: 7615-7620Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It was shown previously that the N111G mutant receptor has decreased affinity to losartan, a surmountable non-peptide antagonist of the AT1 receptor (9Feng Y.H. Miura S. Husain A. Karnik S.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15791-15798Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Our data show that compared with the wild type AT1receptor the N111G mutant receptor also has 100-fold lower affinity for the insurmountable non-peptide antagonist candesartan. The reduced affinity of non-peptide antagonists to this mutant receptor suggests that, while receptor preactivation causes optimal alignment of the binding pocket for the C-terminal residues of Ang II, it also causes misalignment of the residues involved in the binding of non-peptide AT1 receptor blockers. Since non-peptide AT1receptor blockers have much higher affinity to the inactive conformation of the receptor, they could act as inverse agonists irrespectively of their surmountable/insurmountable character. In conclusion, our data show that the two N-terminal amino acid residues of Ang II are no longer required for its high affinity binding to the N111G mutated AT1 receptor (i.e. the receptor in a preactivated state) and that Val3 plays only a minor role in this process. Based on these findings, we propose a model of AT1 receptor activation that pinpoints the role of Arg2 of Ang II in the preactivation process,i.e. it stabilizes a conformation of the receptor that is optimal for binding of the C-terminal five residues of Ang II (Fig. 3). These C-terminal residues are then sufficient to produce full receptor activation. Furthermore, whereas Asn111 stabilizes the inactive conformation of the receptor by interacting with TM VII, it is also likely that it interacts with Tyr4 of the ligand during the preactivation process of the receptor (13Noda K.

https://openalex.org/W2011409781,"Nephrocystin is the protein product of the gene mutated in juvenile nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease afflicting children and young adults. Because the normal cellular function of nephrocystin is largely unknown, the molecular defects underlying disease pathogenesis remain obscure. Analysis of nephrocystin amino acid sequences from human and other species revealed three distinct conserved domains including Src homology 3 and coil-coil domains in the N-terminal region, as well as a large highly conserved C-terminal region bearing no obvious homology to other proteins and hence referred to as the “nephrocystin homology domain” (NHD). The objective of this study was to gain insight into nephrocystin function by defining functional properties of the conserved domains. We analyzed a series of nephrocystin deletion mutants expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney and COS-7 cells. This analysis revealed previously unrecognized functional attributes of the NHD, including abilities to promote both self-association and epithelial cell-cell junctional targeting. We further observed that Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines stably expressing a nephrocystin mutant with a deletion of the Src homology 3 domain have reduced ability to establish tight junctions as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. Finally, from a two-hybrid screen and coimmunoprecipitation studies we identified members of the filamin family of actin-binding proteins as having the capacity to interact with the NHD. These findings support a functional role for nephrocystin as a docking protein involved in organizing a protein complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton at sites of epithelial cell-cell adhesion and further suggest that these properties are important for establishing epithelial cell polarity. Nephrocystin is the protein product of the gene mutated in juvenile nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease afflicting children and young adults. Because the normal cellular function of nephrocystin is largely unknown, the molecular defects underlying disease pathogenesis remain obscure. Analysis of nephrocystin amino acid sequences from human and other species revealed three distinct conserved domains including Src homology 3 and coil-coil domains in the N-terminal region, as well as a large highly conserved C-terminal region bearing no obvious homology to other proteins and hence referred to as the “nephrocystin homology domain” (NHD). The objective of this study was to gain insight into nephrocystin function by defining functional properties of the conserved domains. We analyzed a series of nephrocystin deletion mutants expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney and COS-7 cells. This analysis revealed previously unrecognized functional attributes of the NHD, including abilities to promote both self-association and epithelial cell-cell junctional targeting. We further observed that Madin-Darby canine kidney cell lines stably expressing a nephrocystin mutant with a deletion of the Src homology 3 domain have reduced ability to establish tight junctions as measured by transepithelial electrical resistance. Finally, from a two-hybrid screen and coimmunoprecipitation studies we identified members of the filamin family of actin-binding proteins as having the capacity to interact with the NHD. These findings support a functional role for nephrocystin as a docking protein involved in organizing a protein complex to regulate the actin cytoskeleton at sites of epithelial cell-cell adhesion and further suggest that these properties are important for establishing epithelial cell polarity.

Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar).The elucidation of the primary structure of nephrocystin gave few clues to biochemical function and hence provided no immediate insight into the mechanism of disease pathogenesis. The most notable structural feature is a Src homology 3 (SH3)2 domain, a widespread protein-protein interaction module recognizing proline-rich motifs, which spans residues 157–207 of human nephrocystin. Another structural feature predicted from the nephrocystin amino acid sequence is a series of three 17–18-residue stretches, all within the N-terminal 105 amino acid residues, predicted to form short coiled-coil domains (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Otto E. Kispert A. Schätzle S. Lescher B. Rensing C. Hildebrandt F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 270-282PubMed Google Scholar). The coiled-coil domain is an amphipathic α-helical heptad repeat recognized for its ability to mediate protein dimerization or oligomerization through hydrophobic interactions (9Burkhard P. Stetefeld J. Strelkov S.V. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 82-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). The presence of SH3 and coiled-coil domains indicate nephrocystin functions as part of a larger protein complex. In addition to human, cDNAs encoding full-length mouse nephrocystin have been described (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Otto E. Kispert A. Schätzle S. Lescher B. Rensing C. Hildebrandt F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 270-282PubMed Google Scholar), as has a partial cDNA for canine nephrocystin (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Comparison of the human and mouse sequences indicate that the N-terminal region of predicted coiled-coiled domains and the nearby SH3 domain are well conserved, with each showing 80% amino acid identity. However the C-terminal two-thirds of nephrocystin (human residues 228–677 and mouse residues 241–691)1 is even more highly conserved with 87% amino acid identity, indicating that this region of the protein also has an important function conserved through evolution. Protein sequence database searches reveal only one other protein with clear homology to the large conserved nephrocystin C-terminal region, a hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans protein designated M28.7 that shows 23% overall identity and 42% similarity to the human sequence (8Otto E. Kispert A. Schätzle S. Lescher B. Rensing C. Hildebrandt F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 270-282PubMed Google Scholar). Also conserved in M28.7 are the SH3 and putative coiled-coil domains further indicating it represents a distantly related nephrocystin ortholog. Because the conserved C-terminal two-thirds of nephrocystin appear to represent a unique structural and functional protein domain, it can be conveniently referred to as the “nephrocystin homology domain” (NHD). The NHD, SH3, and coiled-coil domains are separated by short, poorly conserved stretches rich in glutamic acid residues. Expression studies indicate that the nephrocystin transcript is not uniquely expressed in the kidney but is widely detected in mouse embryos and in a variety of human and mouse adult tissues (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 8Otto E. Kispert A. Schätzle S. Lescher B. Rensing C. Hildebrandt F. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 270-282PubMed Google Scholar). Thus nephrocystin may function in many cell types, although the pathogenic consequence of loss-of-function is confined largely to the kidney. Although the biochemical function of nephrocystin is still obscure, recent studies aimed at identifying nephrocystin-interacting proteins point to a possible role in adhesion-regulated signaling events involved in regulating the actin cytoskeleton. The first indication of this came from independent yeast two-hybrid screens that identified the protein “Crk-associated substrate” (CAS) as a binding partner for the nephrocystin SH3 domain (4Hildebrandt F. Otto E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 1753-1761PubMed Google Scholar, 7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Both nephrocystin and CAS were shown to localize prominently at sites of cell-cell contact in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). CAS is a signaling protein that interacts with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of both the focal adhesion kinase and Src families and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation in response to integrin-mediated cell adhesion, an event that has been implicated in various cellular responses including actin cytoskeletal changes associated with migration (reviewed in Ref. 10Bouton A.H. Riggins R.B. Bruce-Staskal P.J. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6448-6458Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). CAS has been further implicated as a regulator of actin cytoskeletal architecture at sites of cell adhesion from a mouse knock-out study that revealed that CAS deficiency results in a disorganization of cardiocyte myofibrils and Z-disks, whereas CAS null mouse embryo fibroblasts exhibit disorganized actin stress fibers (11Honda H. Oda H. Nakamoto T. Honda Z. Sakai R. Suzuki T. Saito T. Nakamura K. Nakao K. Isikawa T. Katsuki M. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 361-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Another recent study found evidence for an interaction between the nephrocystin SH3 domain and the tyrosine kinase PYK2, a member of the focal adhesion kinase family, and reported that forced expression of nephrocystin in kidney inner medullary collecting duct cells was associated with both a relocalization of PYK2 to an insoluble subcellular fraction and an increase in PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (12Benzing T. Gerke P. Hopker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9748-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In addition to CAS and PYK2 (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 12Benzing T. Gerke P. Hopker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9748-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), nephrocystin has also been shown to coimmunoprecipitate with tensin (12Benzing T. Gerke P. Hopker K. Hildebrandt F. Kim E. Walz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9748-9789Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), a tyrosine kinase substrate and actin-binding protein also localized at sites of cell adhesion. Interestingly, the mouse knock-out of the gene encoding tensin gives rise to a cystic kidney phenotype similar to nephronophthisis (13Lo S.H. Yu Q.C. Degenstein L. Chen L.B. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1349-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest nephrocystin functions as part of a signaling and/or actin cytoskeletal organizing complex at sites of cell-cell and/or cell-matrix adhesion, and in the kidney this could be particularly important for establishing and/or maintaining the differentiated state of tubular epithelial cells. The objective of the present study was to gain additional insight into the normal function of nephrocystin, and hence into mechanisms underlying nephronophthisis, by further defining structural and functional properties of the nephrocystin conserved domains. Our results revealed unexpected roles for the NHD in targeting nephrocystin to epithelial cell-cell junctions and in mediating both self-association and interaction with actin-binding proteins of the filamin family. We also obtained evidence that interactions made by the SH3 domain contribute to the establishment of epithelial cell polarity. Monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the c-Myc epitope was obtained from CalBiochem-NovaBiochem. Monoclonal antibody 12CA5 against the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Monoclonal antibody MAB1678 against the 190-kDa portion of human filamin was from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA). Rabbit anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Alexa488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Construction of plasmids pRK5mycNphFL and pRK5mycNphΔSH3 for expression of N-terminal c-Myc epitope-tagged mouse nephrocystin (full-length and SH3 deletion, respectively) have been described (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Additional pRK5myc-based plasmids were constructed for expression of additional N-terminal c-Myc-tagged mouse nephrocystin deletion mutants; mycNphΔCoil lacks the N-terminal 106-amino acid residues including the coiled-coil domain, mycNHD lacks the N-terminal 220 residues including both the coiled-coil and SH3 domains, and mycNphΔC77, mycNphΔC266, and mycNphΔC371 lack the C-terminal 77, 226, and 371 residues, respectively. The full-length mouse nephrocystin cDNA was also subcloned into mammalian expression vector pJ3H (14Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Gene. 1995; 152: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Jonathan Chernoff, Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia) to generate plasmid pJ3H-NphFL for expression of HA-tagged nephrocystin in which the N-terminal three residues (MLA) are replaced by the epitope MYPYDVPDYASRGS (epitope underlined). The truncation mutants lacking the C-terminal 77 or 266 residues of nephrocystin were also subcloned into pJ3H for expression of HA-NphΔC77 and HA-NphΔC266. All plasmid constructs were made using standard procedures and confirmed by sequencing. The plasmid pCDM8-ABP6.6 (kindly provided by Joan Fox, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH), which expresses amino acid residues 1–2136 of human filamin-A (filA-2136), has been described (15Meyer S.C.

Plasmids were transfected into COS-7 cells using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen), and cells were cultured for 2 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, prior to harvesting for coimmunoprecipitation studies. COS-7 cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaF, 1% aprotinin, 0.1 mm Na3VO4), and lysates were clarified and pre-cleared. Immunoprecipitations were carried out from 1-ml lysates (∼500 μg of total protein) by sequential incubations with 2 μg of primary antibody (9E10 or 12CA5) or 2 μl of primary antibody (MAB1678) followed by 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG. The immunoprecipitates were recovered on protein A-Sepharose beads (Zymed Laboratories, South San Francisco, CA). After extensive washing of the beads, bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Pall Gelman Laboratory, Ann Arbor, MI). The membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated for 2 h with either 1.9 μg/ml 9E10 antibody (to detect Myc-tagged nephrocystin variants) or 1.2 μg/ml 12CA5 antibody (to detect HA-tagged proteins). To detect filamin-A, membranes were blocked for 1 h in 5% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated for 2 h with MAB1678 at a 1:400 dilution. The bound antibodies were then visualized by secondary incubations with 0.05 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG followed by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Construction of pCB6-mycNph and pCB6-mycNphΔSH3 and the establishment of mycNphFL and mycNphΔSH3 cell lines has been described previously (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Construction of pCB6-mycNphΔCoil, pCB6-mycNphΔC77, pCB6 mycNphΔC266, and pCB6-mycNHD and the establishment of their respective MDCK cell lines (mycNphΔCoil, mycNphΔC77, mycNphΔC266, and mycNphNHD) were carried out by subcloning from the relevant pRK5myc plasmid as described previously (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The culture, fixation, and immunostaining of the MDCK cells stably expressing the c-Myc epitope-tagged nephrocystin variants were carried out as described previously (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) except that goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa488 conjugate (3.3 μg/ml) was used as the secondary antibody. The cells were viewed on a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. A yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 Two-Hybrid System 3 (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), which utilizes the yeast strain AH109 harboring three reporter genes (HIS3,ADE2, and MEL1), each with unique GAL4 upstream activating sequences and TATA boxes to minimize false positives. PCR was used to amplify the C-terminal 1410 nucleotides of canine nephrocystin that was then subcloned into the plasmid pGBKT7. The resulting plasmid, pGBKT7-dNphNHD, expresses the C-terminal 470 amino acids of canine nephrocystin as the bait fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The prey library consists of cDNAs prepared from HCA-7 cells, a well differentiated human colorectal cancer cell line, which were polarized by growth on Transwell filters. Utilizing sequential transformations, the bait plasmid and then the prey library were transformed into the AH109 strain. Transformants were selected initially by growth on plates lacking histidine and containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,3-triazole (Sigma) to minimize background growth of AH109 on plates lacking histidine. From ∼1 × 107 transformants, ∼1 × 105 colonies appeared after 1 week. 1,000 transformants were seeded on plates lacking both histidine and adenine and containing X-α-galactose that allows for simultaneous selection for activation of all three reporter genes. Approximately 100 of these exhibited clear activation of all three reporter genes, and 36 of these were selected for isolation of the prey plasmids and sequencing of the cDNAs encoding the protein interacting with nephrocystin (PIN). The PINs encoding filamins (PIN-39, PIN-119, and PIN-326) were further characterized for lack of autoactivation of reporter genes by transforming the prey plasmids alone or in combination with the bait plasmid into AH109. Various MDCK cell lines stably expressing Myc-tagged NphFL, NphΔSH3, or the vector alone were analyzed by electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) (16Wegener J. Keese C.R. Giaver I. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 158-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells from confluent populations were harvested by gentle trypsinization, resuspended at 106 cells/ml in culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 200 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin), and then seeded in duplicate into ECIS electrode wells at 2 × 105 cells/cm2. The resistance generated as the cells settled, spread, and polarized was measured continuously at a frequency of 600 Hz over 48 h. The average -fold increase in resistance was calculated as the ratio of average maximal resistance to average initial resistance for duplicate wells in three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way, between groups analysis of variance. Ap value <0.05 was considered significant. To enable structure-function studies, plasmids were constructed for expression of nephrocystin variants with N-terminal c-Myc epitope tags. In addition to previously described (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) constructs expressing full-length tagged nephrocystin (NphFL; see Fig.1 A) and an SH3 domain deletion mutant (NphΔSH3; see Fig. 1 B), additional constructs were made for expressing two N-terminal truncation mutants lacking either the predicted coiled-coil domains (NphΔCoil; see Fig. 1 C) or both coiled-coil and SH3 domains (NphNHD; see Fig. 1 D) and three C-terminal truncation mutants lacking 371, 266, or 77 residues (NphΔC371, NphΔC266, and NphΔC77; see Fig. 1,E–G). Also, plasmids were constructed for expressing NphFL, NphΔC77, and NphΔC266 in which the c-Myc epitope tag was replaced with the HA tag. As an initial characterization, plasmids expressing Myc-tagged nephrocystin variants were transfected in COS-7 cells, and expression was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting using the 9E10 antibody against the Myc tag (Fig.2 B, top panel). All variants were expressed, although two large truncation mutants, NphΔC371 and NphNHD, were expressed to lower levels than the others (Fig. 2 B, open arrows). During this analysis for NphFL, we observed that the 9E10 antibody detected not only a major band of the expected size of ∼90 kDa but also a minor band of ∼180 kDa (Fig. 2 A, lane 1, arrow). The apparent mass of the minor band and its recognition by the 9E10 antibody suggest it represents a nephrocystin homodimer that either persists or forms after boiling in electrophoresis sample buffer. The presence of predicted coiled-coil domains in nephrocystin may be expected to play a role in stabilizing such a dimer. However analysis of the NphΔCoil mutant also revealed the high molecular mass band, although it was now shifted in size reflective of the truncation (Fig.2 A, lane 2, arrow). Thus the N-terminal coiled-coil domains do not play an essential role in stabilizing the putative dimer. To determine whether nephrocystin is capable of self-associating in cells, and to better define the region responsible, the panel of Myc-tagged nephrocystin variants were expressed individually in COS-7 cells, together with the HA-tagged NphFL, and analyzed for their ability to coimmunoprecipitate. Fig. 2 B (lower panel) shows the results obtained when immunoprecipitates were formed using 9E10 antibody, and the recovery of coprecipitating HA-tagged NphFL was assessed by immunoblotting with 12CA5 antibody. HA-tagged NphFL was detected readily in each immunoprecipitate except for that of Myc-tagged NphΔC371 (Fig. 2 B, lane 7). The detection of HA-tagged NphFL in the immunoprecipitates of Myc-tagged NphNHD, even though NphNHD was expressed to a lower level than NphΔC371, indicates that the inability to detect HA-tagged NphFL in the NphΔC371 immunoprecipitate is not simply because of low expression (note that the NphNHD lane in Fig. 2 B,upper panel, lane 8, represents a longer exposure than the other lanes). Likewise, in reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation experiments using the same lysates, only the NphΔC371 Myc-tagged variant could not be detected in immunoprecipitates of HA-tagged nephrocystin formed with the 12CA5 antibody (Fig. 2 C,lower panel; NphΔC266 and NphNHD migrate slightly above the IgG band and are indicated by open arrows). Taken together, the data shown in Fig. 2 indicate that nephrocystin can form a homodimer requiring amino acid residues 321–425, which fall mainly within the N-terminal half of the NHD. Neither the SH3 nor coiled-coil domains appear to play a role in promoting nephrocystin self-association. To further identify functional domains of nephrocystin, stable MDCK cell lines were established that express NphFL, NphΔSH3, NphΔCoil, NphΔC266, NphΔC77, or NphNHD, each with the N-terminal Myc tag. Because our previous study revealed that nephrocystin colocalizes prominently with E-cadherin at cell-cell adherens junctions of MDCK cells (7Donaldson J.C. Dempsey P.J. Reddy S. Bouton A.H. Coffey R.J. Hanks S.K. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the targeting domain responsible for this localization. Thus cells expressing nephrocystin variants were grown on Transwell filters, and the 9E10 antibody was used to determine subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence staining. In addition to NphFL, the prominent cell-cell junctional localization was observed for NphΔSH3, NphΔCoil, and NphNHD (Fig. 3,A–D), indicating that the NHD is sufficient to target nephrocystin to the cell-cell junctions whereas neither the SH3 nor coiled-coil domains are required. However removal of the C-terminal 266 amino acid residues of nephrocystin prevented the junctional localization, as did the much shorter C-terminal truncation of 77 residues (Fig. 3, E and F). As controls for antibody specificity, we observed no 9E10 immunoreactivity in either parental MDCK cells or cells expressing the vector alone (data not shown). To further study the NHD, a yeast two-hybrid screen was conducted using a bait consisting of the C-terminal 470 amino acids of canine nephrocystin representing the entire NHD (Fig. 4 A). The bait was screened against a cDNA library derived from polarized HCA-7 cells, a well differentiated human colorectal epithelial cell line. The screen netted 19 independent cDNAs encoding PINs. Of these, two PINs were notable in that they represented homologous regions of two different members of the class of actin-binding proteins known as filamins (Fig. 4 B). PIN-39 contains amino acid residues 1671–1850 of filamin-A (ABP-280), starting within filamin repeat 15 and stopping near the end of repeat 16. PIN-326 contains residues 1649–2008 of filamin-B (ABP-278) starting within repeat 15 a"

Oxyradical production and membrane lipid peroxidation occur in neurons in response to normal activity in neuronal circuits, whereas excessive lipid peroxidation is implicated in the pathogenesis of of neurodegenerative disorders. We now report on a specific mechanism whereby lipid peroxidation can modulate the activity of VDCCs. The lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (4HN) enhances dihydropyridine-sensitive whole-cell Ca2+ currents and increases depolarization-induced increases of intracellular Ca2+levels in hippocampal neurons. Prolonged exposure to 4HN results in neuronal death, which is prevented by treatment with glutathione and attenuated by the L-type Ca2+ channel blocker nimodipine. Tyrosine phosphorylation of α1 VDCC subunits is increased in neurons exposed to 4HN, and studies using inhibitors of tyrosine kinases and phosphatases indicate a requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation in the enhancement of VDCC activity in response to 4HN. Phosphorylation-mediated modulation of Ca2+ channel activity in response to lipid peroxidation may play important roles in the responses of neurons to oxidative stress in both physiological and pathological settings.

Increased MLP occurs in paradigms of synaptic plasticity such as long-term potentiation, and antioxidants that suppress MLP can modify such processes (5Nilova N.S. Polezhaeva L.N. Neurosci. Behav.

The mechanism whereby MLP damages neurons involves an aldehyde called 4-hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (4HN), which is liberated from peroxidized fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid, and can covalently modify proteins on cysteine, lysine, and histidine residues (10Mark R.J.

When neurons are exposed to agents that induce MLP, 4HN accumulates in the cells at concentrations of 1–10 μm (9Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Similar concentrations of 4HN can impair synaptic function and facilitate neuronal apoptosis and excitotoxicity (9Mark R.J.

It was recently reported that 4HN can alter signal transduction pathways by modifying the activities of kinases and transcription factors (16Liu W. Akhand A.A. Kato M. Yokoyama I. Miyata T.

Voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCCs) play critical roles in the regulation of levels of intracellular Ca2+ and thereby control an array of physiological processes in neurons including neurotransmitter release, synaptic plasticity, and gene expression (for review, see Refs. 20Berridge M.J.

Overactivation of VDCCs, particularly under conditions of reduced energy availability or increased oxidative stress, contributes to neuronal death in experimental models of stroke, trauma, and Alzheimer's disease (22Miljanich G.P.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 529-537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). VDCCs are heteromeric complexes of α, β, and sometimes γ subunits. The activity of VDCCs is modulated by phosphorylation such that channel activity is increased in response to phosphorylation of one or more subunits on tyrosine or serine residues (24Sculptoreanu A.

Despite the evidence that MLP can alter synaptic function and promote neuronal degeneration, the effects of MLP on VDCCs are unknown. In the present study, we employed whole-cell patch clamp, Ca2+ imaging, and immunochemical methods to examine the effects of 4HN on VDCCs in hippocampal neurons. Our data demonstrate that 4HN can increase the activity of VDCCs by a mechanism involving increased tyrosine phosphorylation of channel subunits. Primary hippocampal cell cultures were established from embryonic rats (day 18 of gestation) as detailed elsewhere (29Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Cells were plated into polyethyleneimine-coated plastic culture dishes or 22-mm2 glass coverslips at a density of 80–100 cells/mm2. The cultures were maintained in Neurobasal Medium with B27 supplements (Invitrogen). The atmosphere consisted of 6% CO2/94% room air and was maintained near saturation with water. Experiments were performed in cultures that had been maintained for 8–10 days. Using these culture conditions, ∼95% of the cells are neurons, and the remaining cells are astrocytes. Immediately before experimental treatment, the culture maintenance medium was replaced with Locke's buffer (154 mm NaCl, 5.6 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 3.6 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm glucose, and 5 mmHepes buffer, pH 7.2). 4-Hydroxy-2,3-nonenal (Cayman Chemical) was prepared as a 1000× stock in ethanol. Nimodipine, genistein, and okadaic acid (Sigma) were prepared as 500× stocks in dimethyl sulfoxide. ω-Conotoxin-GVIA and ω-agatoxin-TK (Research Biochemicals International) were dissolved in saline. Sodium vanadate (Sigma) was prepared as 500× stock, and glutathione ethyl ester (Sigma) was prepared as a 50× stock in saline. In all experiments, an equivalent volume of vehicle was added to control cultures. Neuron survival was quantified by counting the number of viable neurons in premarked microscope fields before and at indicated time points after exposure to experimental treatments as described previously (29Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). These methods were similar to those used previously (30Furukawa K., Fu, W., Li, Y. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8178-8186Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Furukawa K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1876-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Briefly, responses were recorded at room temperature using a whole-cell recording configuration with a patch clamp amplifier (Axopatch-1D) and data acquisition and analysis software (pCLAMP-8) with filtering at 2 kHz. Glass pipettes were pulled with a Flaming-Brown horizontal puller (Sutter Instruments, Novato, CA). Electrodes were coated with Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) and had an average resistance of 2 megaohms. For recording whole-cell currents through VDCCs, the ionic composition of the external solution was 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm CsCl, 8 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, 0.3 μm tetrodotoxin, and 10 mm Hepes (the pH was adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH, and the osmolarity was adjusted to 330 mosmol with sucrose). The internal solution contained 145 mm methanesulfonic acid, 10 mm Hepes, 11 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm Mg-ATP, 13 mm tetramethylammonium chloride, 0.1 mmleupeptin, and 10 mm Hepes. Whole-cell current amplitude was normalized by dividing by whole-cell capacitance to yield current density. Cell capacitance and series resistance were measured at the start of each recording. Cells were constantly perfused with external solution, and test agents were applied to neurons via rapid switch of solutions using a six-channel valve controller apparatus (Warner Instrument Corp.). Intracellular free Ca2+ levels ([Ca2+] i ) were quantified by fluorescence imaging of the calcium indicator dye Fura-2 as described previously (29Mattson M.P. Lovell M.A. Furukawa K. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1740-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated for 30 min in the presence of 2 μm acetoxymethylester form of Fura-2 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), washed with Locke's buffer, and incubated for 40 min before imaging. Cells were imaged on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope (×40 oil immersion objective) coupled to an Attofluor imaging system. The [Ca2+] i in 12–20 neuronal cell bodies/microscope field was monitored before and after exposure of cells to KCl, which was added to the bathing medium by dilution from a 4× stock. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (32Chan S.L. Mayne M. Holden C.P. Geiger J.D. Mattson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18195-18200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Briefly, after exposure to 4HN or vehicle, cultures were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Channel subunits were immunoprecipitated from 200 μg of cell lysate using rabbit polyclonal antibodies that recognize either all isoforms of the α subunit of VDCCs or only the α1c subunit. 4HN-modified proteins were immunoprecipitated using a mouse monoclonal antibody that specifically recognizes 4HN-modified proteins (14Pedersen W.A. Chan S.L. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1426-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Waeg G. Mimsity G. Esterbauer H. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The antibody-lysate solution was left overnight at 4 °C on a rotary shaker, and the antibody-antigen complex was then pelleted using protein A linked to acrylic beads (M01; Sigma). The pellet was washed three times with ice-cold radioimmune precipitation buffer, and the final pellet was suspended in 2× Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were boiled for 10 min and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 s, and the supernatant was loaded on a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel. Protein was transferred to nitrocellulose, and the blot was incubated with a primary antibody. The blot was further processed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection method (AmershamBiosciences). Primary antibodies used included an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of the α subunit of VDCCs (anti-panα, mouse monoclonal antibody from Alomone Laboratories; 1:50 dilution for immunoprecipitation and 1:1000 dilution for immunoblots), antibodies specific for either the α1c or α1d subunits of VDCCs (anti-α1c, mouse monoclonal antibody from Alomone Laboratories; 1:50 dilution for immunoprecipitation and 1:1000 dilution for immunoblots), anti-phosphotyrosine (mouse monoclonal antibody from Transduction Laboratories; 1:1000 dilution), anti-phosphoserine (mouse monoclonal antibody from Sigma; 1:500 dilution), and anti-α-tubulin (rabbit polyclonal antibody from Sigma; 1:1000 dilution). Previous studies have shown that concentrations of 4HN in the range of 1–10 μm accumulate in cultured hippocampal neurons exposed to agents that induce MLP and that exposure of hippocampal neurons to similar concentrations of 4HN can alter synaptic function and promote excitotoxicity (9Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 15Keller J.N. Pang Z. Geddes J.W. Begley J.G. Germeyer A. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In preliminary studies, we determined that concentrations of 1–10 μm4HN were not acutely toxic to neurons but did induce delayed death of neurons and increase their vulnerability to excitotoxicity (9Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 11Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whole-cell Ca2+ currents were recorded under basal conditions and at increasing time points after exposure to 4HN. Pretreatment of hippocampal neurons with 1 μm 4HN for 2 h resulted in a significant 40% increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current, and the current amplitude was increased by an additional 20% in neurons exposed to 10 μm 4HN (Fig. 1, A and C). Analysis of the current-voltage relationships of the currents recorded in the absence or presence of 4HN revealed that the voltage dependence and the voltage generating the maximum inward current (approximately 10 mV) remained unchanged in neurons exposed to 4HN (Fig. 1 B). The enhancement of the Ca2+ current by 4HN was time-dependent such that exposure times of 10 min or less had no significant effect on the current, whereas longer exposure periods resulted in progressive increases in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current, which reached a peak level at 2 h and remained elevated through 4 h of exposure (Fig. 1 D). The effect of 4HN on the Ca2+ current was specific for this aldehyde in that exposure of neurons to malondialdehyde (a major product of MLP) for 2 h at concentrations of up to 100 μm had no effect on the amplitude of the Ca2+current (data not shown), consistent with our previous data showing that among aldehydes produced as a result of MLP, 4HN is uniquely toxic to neurons (9Mark R.J. Lovell M.A. Markesbery W.R. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). We next measured intracellular free Ca2+ levels by imaging of the Ca2+ indicator dye Fura-2 in control and 4HN-treated hippocampal neurons under basal conditions and after membrane depolarization. The basal concentration of Ca2+ was similar (70–110 nm) in neurons in control cultures and in cultures that had been exposed for 2 h to 1 μm 4HN (Fig.1 E). In control cultures, exposure to KCl resulted in a rapid rise of the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to a peak level of ∼280 nm, followed by a decrease to a sustained level of ∼200 nm 2 min later. In 4HN-treated cultures, both the peak and sustained depolarization-induced increase of Ca2+ levels were significantly increased to ∼400 nm compared with the responses in neurons in control cultures (Fig. 1, E and F). Cultured embryonic hippocampal neurons express VDCCs of the L, N, and P/Q types, with the majority of whole-cell current being contributed by L-type channels (31Furukawa K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 1876-1886Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 34Blalock E.M. Porter N.M. Landfield P.W. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8674-8684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which of these types of channels were affected by 4HN, we employed pharmacological agents that selectively block each channel type. Neurons were sequentially exposed to blockers of three different classes of VDCCs, and the Ca2+ currents were recorded. In control cultures, addition of ω-conotoxin-GVIA (a blocker of N-type channels) resulted in a 34% decrease in the Ca2+ current, addition of nimodipine (a blocker of L-type channels) resulted in an additional 32% decrease, and addition of ω-agatoxin-TK (a blocker of P/Q channels; Refs. 35Wheeler D.B. Randall A. Tsien R.W. Science. 1994; 264: 107-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholarand 36Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.-F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar) caused an additional 30% decrease in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current (Fig. 2). In 4HN-treated neurons, ω-conotoxin-GVIA caused a 24% decrease in the Ca2+ current amplitude, nimodipine caused an additional 47% decrease, and ω-agatoxin-TK caused an additional 28% decrease (Fig. 2). Because the total increase in Ca2+ current induced by 4HN is ∼50%, these results suggest that the increase is due mainly to increases in current carried by L-type and P/Q-type channels. The increase in whole-cell Ca2+ current induced by 4HN might result from an increase in the number of channels present or from increased activity of a fixed number of channels. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we performed immunoblot analyses to assess relative levels of VDCC proteins in control and 4HN-treated hippocampal neurons. Similar levels of the α1 subunit of VDCC were present in homogenates from control cultures and cultures that had been exposed for 2 h to 10 μm 4HN, as determined in immunoblots probed with either an antibody that recognizes all isoforms of the α1 subunit of VDCCs or an antibody specific for the α1c isoform (Fig.3). Because proteins can be covalently modified by 4HN, we determined whether this was the case with VDCC subunits. Proteins in lysates of control and 4HN-treated cultures were immunoprecipitated using an antibody against 4HN-modified proteins (10Mark R.J. Pang Z. Geddes J.W. Uchida K. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1046-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,33Waeg G. Mimsity G. Esterbauer H. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 25: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), and the precipitated proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis using the pan-α1 or α1c-specific antibodies. No band could be detected with the αl subunit antibodies, suggesting that these proteins are not modified by 4HN (Fig. 3). Because currents through VDCCs are known to be increased by phosphorylation of channel α subunit proteins (25Haby C. Larsson O. Islam M.S. Aunis D. Berggren P.O. Zwiller J. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 26Rane S.G. Pollock J.D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 38: 590-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Kavalali E.T. Hwang K.S. Plummer M.R. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5334-5348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we performed additional experiments to determine whether 4HN might modify VDCC protein phosphorylation in a manner that enhances Ca2+currents. To this end, we exposed neurons to 4HN for increasing time periods, immunoprecipitated the α1 subunits of VDCCs from equal amounts of cell homogenates (200 μg of protein), and performed an immunoblot analysis using an antibody that selectively binds to proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. The results indicated that levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of α1 proteins were increased within 30 min of exposure to 4HN, continued to increase through 90 min, and then decreased at 3 h (Fig. 4). Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot analysis using a phosphoserine antibody indicated that no significant increase in the level of serine phosphorylation of α1 proteins occurs in neurons exposed to 4HN, whereas okadaic acid (1 μm), an inhibitor of serine phosphatases, causes a large increase in the level of immunoreactivity of α1 subunits with the anti-phosphoserine antibody (Fig.5 A). The increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of α1 proteins in response to 4HN was comparable to that observed in neurons exposed to the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate (Fig. 5 B). Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot analysis using an antibody specific for αlc and α1d revealed significant increases in tyrosine phosphorylation of these L-type VDCC subunits in neurons exposed to 4HN (Fig. 5,C and D).Figure 54HN increases tyrosine phosphorylation of the α1 VDCC subunit in hippocampal neurons. Hippocampal neurons were treated for 2 h with 1 μm 4HN, 10 μm okadaic acid, 1 mm vanadate, or vehicle. A−D, immunoblots of proteins (50 μg) immunoprecipitated using either the pan-α1 or αlc-specific antibodies were then performed using antibodies against phosphotyrosine (p-tyro) and phosphoserine (p-ser) as indicated. E, samples of cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoblot analysis using an antibody against α-tubulin.

Exposure of neurons to vanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases (37Gordon J.A.

Combined treatment with 4HN and vanadate resulted in an increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current similar to that obtained with either agent alone, suggesting that they may act via a common mechanism. Exposure of neurons to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (30 μm) did not significantly affect the basal Ca2+ current but significantly attenuated the increase in current caused by 4HN (Fig. 6). Collectively, these data suggest that an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of VDCC subunits is involved in enhancement of VDCC activity by 4HN. Prolonged exposure of hippocampal neurons to 4HN results in delayed cell death that is evident after 12–24 h (11Kruman I. Bruce-Keller A.J. Bredesen D.E. Waeg G. Mattson M.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5089-5100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that glutathione is covalently modified by 4HN on the cysteine residue of the peptide and that glutathione can thereby detoxify 4HN and protect cells from injury induced by lipid peroxidation or direct exposure to 4HN (9Mark R.J.

In the present study, we found that this delayed neuronal death was completely prevented in cultures cotreated with glutathione ethyl ester (Fig.7). When hippocampal cultures were cotreated with 500 μm glutathione ethyl ester and 10 μm 4HN, there was no increase in the amplitude of the Ca2+ current. Current amplitudes were as follows: control, 22 + 4.5 pA/picofarad; 4HN, 33 + 5.2 pA/picofarad; glutathione, 26 + 5.9 pA/picofarad; and glutathione + 4HN, 25 + 3.3 pA/picofarad (mean ± S.D.; n = 3). Treatment of neurons with nimodipine significantly attenuated 4HN-induced cell death (Fig. 7), demonstrating the involvement of Ca2+ influx through VDCCs in the neurotoxic action of 4HN. Neither ω-conotoxin-GVIA nor ω-agatoxin-TK affected 4HN-induced cell death (data not shown), consistent with our electrophysiological data showing that 4HN does not alter N- or P/Q-type VDCCs. The present findings are the first to document an effect of the MLP product 4HN on the channel activity of VDCCs. Several lines of evidence suggest that the enhancement of Ca2+ current in response to 4HN is an indirect effect mediated by increased phosphorylation of VDCC subunits on tyrosine residues. First, 4HN may not covalently modify VDCC α1 subunits because we could not detect association of 4HN with α1 subunits using an immunoprecipitation and immunoblot approach that we previously employed to demonstrate covalent modification by 4HN of the glucose transport protein GLUT3 (10Mark R.J.

Based on their susceptibility to block by tetrodotoxin (TTX), VSSCs can be divided into TTX-sensitive (TTX-S) and TTX-resistant (TTX-R) classes. Members of both classes share considerable sequence homology and are closely related structurally (2Goldin A.L. Barchi R.L Caldwell J.H. Hofmann F. Howe J.R. Hunter J.C. Kallen R.G. Mandel G.

These include the neuronal TTX-S type I/Nav1.1, type II/Nav1.2, type III/Nav1.3, PN1/Nav1.7 and PN4/Nav1.6, and the skeletal muscle TTX-S μ1/Nav1.4.

Plumpton C.J. Emson P.C. Clare J.J. Mol. Brain Res. 2001; 88: 37-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). VSSCs are inhibited by local anesthetics and modulated by toxins that act at one inhibitory site (site 1) and at least four other sites that result in excitatory actions. μ-Conotoxins from the venom of marine cone snails act selectively to occlude the pore of the VSSC by competing with TTX and saxitoxin (STX) for binding to site 1 in the P-loop region of the α subunit. To date, sequences for four members of the three-loop μ-conotoxin class have been published (Table I). GIIIA−GIIIC from Conus geographus venom are potent blockers of skeletal muscle but not neuronal VSSCs. The three-dimensional structures of selected μ-conotoxins (19Lancelin J-M. Kohda D. Tate S.

PIIIA is notable for its ability to inhibit neuronal as well as muscle TTX-S sodium channels (26Shon K-J. Olivera B.M. Watkins M. Jacobsen R.B. Gray W.R. Floresca C.Z. Cruz L.J. Hillyard D.R.

Thus, PIIIA is the first peptide toxin for investigating the architecture of site 1 of neuronal VSSCs.Table IPotency (pIC50) and extent of inhibition (%) of [3H]STX binding to VSSCs by μ-conotoxins and TTXμ-ConotoxinHuman brainRat brainRat musclePIIIA Potency7.1 (7.6–6.6)6.5 (6.8–6.3)6.8 (7.1–6.5) Inhibition47 (34–61)%79 (68–91)%81 (67–96)%PIIIA-(2–22) Potency6.6 (7.0–6.2)6.4 (6.6–6.3)7.2 (7.4–7.0) Inhibition70 (58–82)%90 (86–94)%81 (73–93)%GIIIA PotencyInactive5.1 (5.5–4.7)7.1 (7.3–6.9) Inhibition40 (28–52)%82 (76–89)%GIIIB Potency5.5 (6.4–4.5)5.9 (6.2–5.7)7.2 (7.5–7.0) Inhibition36 (17–54)%87 (72–101)%85 (78–92)%GIIIC Potency6.0 (6.6–5.4)Inactive7.3 (7.5–7.1) Inhibition30 (20–41)%93 (86–101)%TTX Potency7.6 (7.8–7.4)7.8 (7.9–7.7)7.8 (7.9–7.7) Inhibition98 (91–105)%100 (97–103)%100 (96–104)%95% confidence interval range for pIC50 and percentage of inhibition are given in parenthesis.

Dudley S., Jr. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4407-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) have revealed that the cationic residues, particularly Arg13, are important for the high potency of this peptide at Nav1.4 (see Fig.1). The high sequence identity and similarities in the three-dimensional structures of GIIIA and GIIIB (19Lancelin J-M. Kohda D. Tate S. Yanagawa Y. Abe T. Satake M. Inagaki F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6908-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) provide a rational basis for comparison with PIIIA, which also contains a number of conserved residues and the same disulfide connectivities as GIIIA and GIIIB (and GIIIC). However, a number of primary structural differences are apparent between PIIIA and other μ-conotoxins, which may affect the relative position and orientation of backbone loops and their projecting side chains and thus allow PIIIA to interact with both neuronal and muscle forms of TTX-sensitive VSSCs. To further investigate the potential of PIIIA as a probe of VSSCs, we determined its structure by 1H NMR spectroscopy and characterized its mode of action on native tissues using electrophysiological and ligand binding approaches. These studies revealed that PIIIA and PIIIA-(2–22) preferentially inhibited the persistent TTX-S currents in rat hippocampal neurons, whereas in rat DRG the TTX-R current was spared. Comparisons of the three-dimensional structures of PIIIA, GIIIA, and GIIIB revealed important structural differences, including an alternative major conformation accessed by PIIIA, which had not been identified previously in μ-conotoxins. Peptides were prepared by Boc chemistry (28Schnölzer M. Alewood P.F. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B.H. Int. J. Pept.

The pellet was suspended in 50 mm HEPES, 10 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) for 30 min, centrifuged, and resuspended in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Radioligand binding studies were conducted in assay buffer (130 mm choline chloride, 5.4 mm KCl, 5.5 mm glucose, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with Tris base)). Assays were conducted on rat brain (18 μg of protein, 150-μl total volume), human brain (12 μg of protein, 150 μl), and rat muscle (50 μg of protein, 300 μl) that contained 5.6 nm [3H]STX (14.9 Ci/mmol; AmershamBiosciences) and varying concentrations of μ-conotoxins in assay buffer. Assays were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C and filtered through GFB filters on a Tomtec harvester (brain) or a Millipore manifold (muscle) using wash buffer (163 mm choline chloride, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 0.8 mmMgSO4, 5.0 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with Tris base)). Filters were dried, scintillant was added, and filters retained radioactivity measured on a Microbeta counter (Wallac). Electrophysiological experiments were conducted to further investigate the effect of PIIIA on TTX-S and TTX-R sodium channels in native tissue. Sensory neurons from rat nodose ganglia and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were isolated as previously described (32Jeglitsch G. Rein K. Baden D.G. Adams D.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 284: 516-525PubMed Google Scholar, 33Nicholson G.M. Walsh R. Little M.J. Tyler M.I. Pflugers Arch. 1998; 436: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Briefly, young rats (10−21 days) were killed by cervical dislocation, and the nodose and DRG were carefully removed. The ganglia were placed in physiological saline solution containing collagenase (∼1.0 mg/ml type 2; Worthington-Biochemical) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2 for 24–48 h. Neurons from the nodose ganglia that were clear and round were selected for experiments. Small diameter cells (∼20 μm) from the DRG were used, since these have previously been reported to predominantly express TTX-resistant Na+ currents (34Elliott A.A. Elliott J.R. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Young rats (14−21 days) were anesthetized under CO2 and decapitated with an animal guillotine. The brain was removed and transferred to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (containing 124 mm NaCl, 26 mm NaH2CO3, 3 mm KCl, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4, and 20 mm glucose). The brain was mounted in a vibratome and bathed in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid equilibrated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 while the 500-μm-thick slices were prepared. Brain slices were incubated for 30 min with 200 units/ml papain (Worthington), 1.1 mm cysteine (Sigma), 0.2 mmEDTA, and 13.4 mm mercaptoethanol at 35 °C. Following incubation, the CA1 region was located, removed, and gently triturated using a fire-polished Pasteur pipette. Neurons of 10–15 μm were used, and cells that were flat, swollen, or grainy in appearance were avoided. Whole cell Na+currents were recorded using the patch clamp technique. Patch pipettes (GC150F; Harvard Apparatus Ltd., Edenbridge, Kent, UK) were prepared that had resistances of between 1 and 2 megaohms (nodose and DRG neurons) and between 6 and 10 megaohms (CA1 neurons) when filled with pipette solution. Whole cell Na+ currents from nodose and DRG neurons were made using a List EPC 7 amplifier (List Medical). Voltage steps were generated by a PC (Dell Pentium) running pClamp (Axon Instruments Inc., Union City, CA). Whole cell Na+currents from CA1 neurons were made using a Axopatch 1D amplifier (Axon Instruments) with voltage steps generated using a PC (Osborne 486-SX) running custom software (14Ju Y. Saint D.A.

To record Na+ currents from DRG and nodose neurons, patch pipettes were filled with the following solution: 135 mm CsF, 10 mm NaCl, 5 mm HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH. The bath solution contained 50 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 90 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.1 mmCdCl2, 7.7 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with TEA-OH. To record Na+ currents from CA1 neurons, the patch pipette solution contained the following solution: 125 mm CsF, 5 mm NaF, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm TES, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with KOH. The bath solution contained 135 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm CoCl2, 5 mm CsCl, 10 mm TES, with pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Three distinct Na+ currents were measured: a transient TTX sensitive Na+ current (TTX-SINaT), a transient TTX-resistant Na+current (TTX-R INaT), and a persistent TTX-sensitive Na+ current (TTX-SINaP). The amplitude of evoked TTX-SINaT was measured at its peak after subtraction of the current evoked in the presence of TTX (0.5−1 μm). The amplitude of the TTX-R INaT was measured at least 2 min following the addition of 0.5−1 μm TTX. The amplitude of TTX-S INaP was measured at the end of a 400-ms voltage step after subtraction of the current evoked in the presence of TTX (0.5−1 μm). All values are expressed as means ± S.E. with n indicating the number of cells in a given series of experiments. Comparisons of two means were made using Student's two-tailed unpaired t test. All NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker ARX 500 spectrometer equipped with a z-gradient unit or on a Bruker DMX 750 spectrometer equipped with an x,y,z-gradient unit. Peptide concentrations were ∼2 mm. PIIIA was examined in 95% H2O, 5% D2O (pH 3.0 and 5.5; 275–298 K) and in 50% aqueous CD3CN (260–293 K). 1H NMR experiments recorded were NOESY (36Jeener J.

The solvent was suppressed using the WATERGATE sequence (41Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenár V. J. Biolmol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3538) Google Scholar). Spectra were processed using UXNMR as described previously (29Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and using Aurelia; subtraction of background was used to minimize T1noise. Chemical shift values were referenced internally to 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonate at 0.00 ppm. Secondary Hα shifts were measured using random coil shift values of Wishartet al. (42Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyason H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 67-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (1426) Google Scholar). 3 JNH-Hαcoupling constants were measured as previously described (29Nielsen K.J. Adams D. Thomas L. Bond T.J. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Lewis R.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 289: 1405-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Peak volumes in NOESY spectra were classified as strong, medium, weak, and very weak, corresponding to upper bounds on interproton distance of 2.7, 3.5, 5.0, and 6.0 Å, respectively. Lower distance bounds were set to 1.8 Å. Appropriate pseudoatom corrections were made (43Wüthrich K. Billeter M. Braun W. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 169: 949-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar), and distances of 0.5 and 2.0 Å were added to the upper limits of restraints involving methyl and phenyl protons, respectively.3 JNH-Hα coupling constants were used to determine φ dihedral angle restraints (44Pardi A. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (940) Google Scholar), and in cases where 3 JNH-Hα was 6−8 Hz and it was clear that a positive dihedral angle was not present, φ was restrained to −100 ± 70°.3 JHα-Hβ coupling constants, together with relevant NOESY peak strengths, were used to determinex1 dihedral angle restraints (45Wagner G. Braun W. Havel T.F. Schaumann T., Go, N. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 196: 611-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). Where there was no diastereospecific assignment for a prochiral pair of protons, the largest upper bound for the two restraints was used. Where stereospecific assignments were established, these distances were specified explicitly. Structures were calculated using the torsion angle dynamics/simulated annealing protocol in X-PLOR (46Brünger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.1. Yale University, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar) version 3.8 using a modified geometric force field based on parhdg.pro. Structure refinements were performed using energy minimization (200 steps) under the influence of a full force field derived from Charmm (47Brooks B. Brucoli R. Olafson B.O. States D. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (14017) Google Scholar) parameters. Structure modeling, visualization, and superimpositions were done using InsightII (MSI). Surface calculations, r.m.s. deviations, and hydrogen bond analysis were done using MOLMOL (48Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 51: 29-32Google Scholar). The quality of the structures was analyzed using procheck-NMR (49Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 631-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The effects of μ-conotoxin PIIIA and a truncated analogue, PIIIA-(2–22), were investigated on three distinct VSSCs found in neurons of the peripheral and central nervous system. Rat nodose ganglion neurons were used to investigate the transient TTX-sensitive voltage-dependent Na+ current(TTX-S INaT), DRG neurons were used to investigate the transient TTX-resistant sodium current (TTX-RINaT) (34Elliott A.A. Elliott J.R. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 39-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and rat hippocampal neurons in the CA1 region were used to investigate the persistent TTX-sensitive sodium current (TTX-S INaP) (15Hammarström A.K. Gage P.W. J. Physiol. 1998; 510: 735-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 50French C.R. Gage P.W. Neurosci. Lett. 1985; 56: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 51French C.R. Sah P. Buckett K.J. Gage P.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1990; 95: 1139-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). PIIIA-(2–22) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the peak amplitude of the TTX-S INaT in rat nodose ganglia neurons (Fig. 2). In contrast, in rat DRG neurons (n = 12), PIIIA-(2–22) produced only a small reduction in the peak amplitude of the TTX-RINaT (Fig. 2). High frequency stimulation can modify the degree of block by some neurotoxins that act in a use-dependent manner. Compared with control, 1 μm PIIIA-(2–22) failed to produce any use-dependent inhibition of peak TTX-SINaT during 20 depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV to a test potential of −30 mV for 25 ms delivered at a frequency of 20 Hz (n = 6). In rat hippocampal CA1 neurons, the addition of PIIIA-(2–22) to the bathing solution caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the peak amplitude of the TTX-S INaT and the TTX-SINaP (Fig. 3). Interestingly, PIIIA-(2–22) had a greater effect on the TTX-SINaP than on the TTX-SINaT (Fig. 3, inset). At 1 μm, the peak amplitude of the TTX-SINaT was unaffected, whereas the amplitude of the TTX-S INaP was reduced by ∼70%.Figure 3Effects of PIIIA-(2–22) on the transient and persistent TTX-sensitive Na+ currents recorded from hippocampal CA1 neurons.

Inset, the differential effects of PIIIA-(2–22) on the amplitude of the transient and persistent Na+ current. Peak amplitudes of the transient and persistent current were normalized to the transient and persistent currents recorded in control solution.

PIIIA had a preferential effect on the persistent compared with the transient sodium current, being slightly more potent at reducing the amplitude of the TTX-S INaT current in CA1 neurons than PIIIA-(2–22). In preliminary experiments, 10-min bath application of GIIIB (1–10 μm) had no effect on either the TTX-S or TTX-R INaT in rat nodose or DRG neurons, respectively (n = 3; data not shown). The ability of μ-conotoxins to displace [3H]STX from VSSCs in human and rat brain and rat skeletal muscle is shown in Fig. 4. All peptides were more potent at the rat skeletal muscle than rat brain VSSCs, with GIIIA and GIIIC showing most selectivity and PIIIA least selectivity. The pIC50 values and percentage inhibition for these peptides are given in Table I. The data show that PIIIA and PIIIA-(2–22) have greatest potency at rat and human brain VSSCs, GIIIB has intermediate potency, and GIIIA and GIIIC have least potency. These peptides were less potent than TTX, with none able to fully displace [3H]STX from rat or human brain (relative to TTX displacement). PIIIA and PIIIA-(2–22) produced the largest displacement of [3H]STX, and GIIIA and GIIIC produced the least displacement. GIIIB was more effective at displacing [3H]STX from rat compared with human brain (Fig. 4,A and B). All displacement curves were best fitted with a Hill slope of −1. PIIIA was examined by1H NMR spectroscopy in a range of different solvent conditions. In aqueous solution at pH 2.5−5.5 over 275−298 K, it was apparent that two conformations of PIIIA were present in a ∼3:1 ratio. In aqueous solution at low pH over 283−298 K, the NH resonances of several residues, including 4−7, 10−12, 20, and 22, were broad, and that of Cys21 was not observable. At higher pH values and lower temperatures (275 K), these peaks sharpened (residues 4 and 5) or separated into two distinct sets of peaks (residues 6 and 7, 10−12, 20, and 22) so that complete assignment of the major and a partial assignment of the minor conformations was possible. The assignment of PIIIA was improved by the addition of up to 50% CD3CN, where the set of peaks arising from the minor conformation was less evident, and all resonances from the major conformation were present. Chemical shift assignments for PIIIA are given in Table II.Table II1H chemical shifts of PIIIAResidueNHHαHβOtherpGlu1(7.98)(4.29)[4.33]Arg2(8.53)[8.59]3.93 (4.25)[4.19]1.79Hγ 1.52; Hδ 2.92, 2.97; δNH 7.07Leu38.47 (8.45)[8.48]4.40 (4.41)[4.32]1.57Hδ 0.88Cys48.41 (8.43)[8.43]4.47 (4.58)2.34, 2.56Cys57.97 (8.03)4.14 (4.28)3.00, 3.47Gly68.38 (8.65)[7.84]3.83 (3.81, 3.82)[3.63, 4.11]Phe77.38 (7.43)[8.35]4.98 (5.05)[4.72]2.98, 3.13Hδ, Hɛ 7.19; Hζ 7.23Hyp84.41 (4.49)[4.28]2.05, 2.34Hγ 4.67; Hδ 3.75, 3.90Lys98.55 (9.02)[8.87]3.98 (4.07)[4.11]1.93Hγ 1.34; Hδ 1.6; Hɛ 2.90; ɛNH3 7.49Ser107.78 (7.92)[8.63]3.98 (4.05)[4.79]3.82, 3.37Cys118.08 (8.25)[8.34]4.39 (4.51)[4.62]3.12, 2.91Arg127.50 (7.52)[8.43]4.19 (4.28)[4.31]1.84, 1.98Hγ 1.66, 1.72; δNH 7.26Ser137.73 (7.86)[7.90]4.48 (4.53)[4.43]3.99, 4.18(OH 5.72)Arg149.04 (9.19)[9.16]3"
https://openalex.org/W2059400954,"The complex between the short splice variant of the ninth member of the RGS protein family and the long splice variant of type 5 G protein β subunit (RGS9-Gβ5L) plays a critical role in regulating the duration of the light response in vertebrate photoreceptors by activating the GTPase activity of the photoreceptor-specific G protein, transducin. RGS9-Gβ5L is tightly associated with the membranes of photoreceptor outer segments; however, the nature of this association remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that rod outer segment membranes contain a limited number of sites for high affinity RGS9-Gβ5L binding, which are highly sensitive to proteolysis. In membranes isolated from bovine rod outer segments, all of these sites are occupied by the endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L, which prevents the binding of exogenous recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L to these sites. However, treating membranes with urea or high pH buffers causes either removal or denaturation of the endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L, allowing for high affinity binding of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L to these sites. This binding results in a striking ∼70-fold increase in the RGS9-Gβ5L ability to activate transducin GTPase. The DEP (disheveled/EGL-10/pleckstrin) domain of RGS9 plays a crucial role in the RGS9-Gβ5L membrane attachment, as evident from the analysis of membrane-binding properties of deletion mutants lacking either N- or C-terminal parts of the RGS9 molecule. Our data indicate that specific association of RGS9-Gβ5L with photoreceptor disc membranes serves not only as a means of targeting it to an appropriate subcellular compartment but also serves as an important determinant of its catalytic activity.

Essential for the high speed of the photoresponse are the rates at which the G protein, transducin, is first activated by photoexcited rhodopsin and at which it is then inactivated by RGS9-Gβ5L.1 The rates of activation and inactivation were both documented to be at the high end of the range observed in the characterized G protein-based signaling pathways (Refs. 5Leskov I.B. Klenchin V.A. Handy J.W. Whitlock G.G. Govardovskii V.I. Bownds M.D. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N., Jr. Arshavsky V.Y.

Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). The rapid rates of both processes may be explained, at least in part, by the membrane association of most of the signaling proteins participating in phototransduction (reviewed in Ref. 1Pugh E.N., Jr. Lamb T.D. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N., Jr. Handbook of Biological Physics: Molecular Mechanisms in Visual Transduction. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000: 183-255Google Scholar). Membrane association may increase the probability that these proteins encounter each other in orientations optimized for their productive interactions. The membrane association of most phototransduction proteins results from either their transmembrane position (e.g. rhodopsin) or their posttranslational modifications by fatty acids of isoprenoids (e.g. the subunits of transducin) (reviewed in Ref. 1Pugh E.N., Jr. Lamb T.D. Stavenga D.G. DeGrip W.J. Pugh E.N., Jr. Handbook of Biological Physics: Molecular Mechanisms in Visual Transduction. Elsevier, Amsterdam2000: 183-255Google Scholar). However, the nature of RGS9-Gβ5L membrane attachment remains unknown. Neither RGS9 nor Gβ5L has been shown to contain transmembrane domains or lipophilic posttranslational modifications. However, RGS9-Gβ5L is bound to photoreceptor membranes so tightly that it can be extracted only under denaturing conditions (7He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 8Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Here we report that photoreceptor membranes contain a limited number of specific sites responsible for the high affinity binding of RGS9-Gβ5L. These sites are susceptible to proteolysis, indicating that they are represented by a membrane-associated protein. Most importantly, we demonstrate that specific membrane association of RGS9-Gβ5L enhances its catalytic activity by ∼70-fold. We further show that this binding requires the presence of the N-terminal DEP domain of RGS9 but not its C-terminal domain. ROS were isolated from the frozen bovine retinas (obtained from T. A. & W. L. Lawson Co., Lincoln, NE) as described in Ref. 10McDowell J.H. Methods Neurosci. 1993; 15: 123-130Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar. All manipulations were conducted under infrared illumination. Urea-treated ROS membranes (uROS) lacking the GAP activity of RGS9 were prepared using a two-step protocol (11Nekrasova E.R. Berman D.M. Rustandi R.R. Hamm H.E. Gilman A.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). First, photoreceptor discs were prepared from ROS in the dark (12Smith H.G. Stubbs G.W. Litman B.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1975; 20: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Second, the residual activity of RGS9 was inactivated by treating discs with 6 m urea for 30 min on ice (13Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Urea was then removed from the membrane preparation by five consecutive washes of the membranes with buffer A containing 250 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Hypotonically washed membranes (ROShyp) were prepared from bleached ROS by washing them twice with a buffer containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm dithiothreitol followed by two transducin extractions by a buffer containing 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0), and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Rhodopsin concentration in all membranes was determined spectrophotometrically from the difference in absorbance at 500 nm before and after rhodopsin bleaching, using the molar extinction coefficient of 40,000 (14Bownds D. Gordon-Walker A. Gaide-Huguenin A.-C. Robinson W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1971; 58: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Bleached rhodopsin in the hypotonically washed membranes was regenerated by 11-cis-retinal (2 h at 37 °C by ∼5-fold molar excess of 11-cis-retinal) prior to the determinations of rhodopsin concentration. Transducin was purified from bovine ROS as described in Ref. 15Ting T.D. Goldin S.B. Ho Y.-K. Methods Neurocsi. 1993; 15: 180-195Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar. The concentration of active transducin used in all calculations was determined based on the maximum amount of rhodopsin-catalyzed GTPγS binding performed as described in Ref. 16Fung B.B.K. Hurley J.B. Stryer L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 152-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar. The PDEγ-(63–87) peptide was synthesized by the solid-phase Merrifield method on an automated peptide synthesizer and purified to homogeneity by reverse-phase HPLC. Purity and chemical formula of the peptide were confirmed by mass spectrometry and analytical reversed-phase HPLC. RGS9 and its truncated variants containing the GGL domain were co-expressed with Gβ5L in the Sf9/baculovirus system and purified as described previously (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The N-terminally His6-tagged DEP was expressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3). Its boundaries were defined as the sequence between residues 14 and 115 using the structure-based multiple sequence alignment (17Wong H.C. Mao J. Nguyen J.T. Srinivas S. Zhang W. Liu B., Li, L., Wu, D. Zheng J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 1178-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This region was amplified by PCR with primers containing upstream NdeI and downstream EcoRI sites. The fragment treated with corresponding endonucleases was cloned to pET-28b(+) vector. Resulting construct contained the coding region for the DEP domain placed after a His6 tag coding sequence and separated by a thrombin cleavage site. Transformed cells were grown at room temperature until they reached A 600 = 0.8. At this point the culture was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for additional 3 h. Cells were disrupted by sonication and soluble protein was purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The purity of all recombinant proteins was at least 80%. Their concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, based on the theoretically calculated values of the corresponding extinction coefficients at 280 nm. The N-terminal His6 tag sequence of all recombinant RGS9 constructs provided a specific antibody recognition epitope in experiments addressing the binding of these proteins to photoreceptor membranes. All binding experiments were conducted on ice in buffer A. Recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L or one of its truncated variants was mixed with ROS membranes (final rhodopsin concentration in most experiments was 60 μm) in the volume of 100 μl, and the mixture was loaded on a 50-μl cushion containing 10% sucrose in the same buffer. The mixture was sedimented at 120,000 × g for 15 min in an air-driven ultracentrifuge (Airfuge, Beckman). The sucrose cushion significantly reduced contaminations of the sedimented ROS membranes by unbound proteins. It was essential to use polyethylene centrifuge tubes (product 343622, Beckman) in these experiments to prevent nonspecific binding of soluble proteins to the plastic surfaces of the tubes. Supernatants were collected, whereas the sucrose cushions were discarded. The pellet was washed once by buffer A containing 1m NaCl to reduce nonspecific protein binding and once by buffer A, and then resuspended in 100 μl of buffer A. 20-μl aliquots of resuspended pellet and supernatant fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and Western-blotted using the His probe (H3) mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) recognizing the His6 tag epitopes of the recombinant proteins. The blots were developed with the Super Signal West Pico Western blot detection kit (Pierce). The use of H3 antibodies rather than antibodies derived against the polypeptides of RGS9-Gβ5L was essential in distinguishing between immunostaining of recombinant RGS9 and endogenous RGS9 present in ROS. Proteolytic digestion of the uROS membranes was performed in 300-μl aliquots containing 90 μm rhodopsin at 22 °C in the presence of either 10 ng of trypsin or 7 μg of Glu-C (V8) protease for 10 min (both proteases were obtained from Sigma). The reaction was stopped by an addition of concentrated mixture of protease inhibitors (CompleteTMEDTA-free from Roche Diagnostics) at the final concentration ten times higher than recommended by the manufacturer. uROS were sedimented in an Airfuge for 10 min and washed twice with buffer A containing the same amount of protease inhibitors. Proteolytic digestion of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L was performed by incubating 250 nm RGS9-Gβ5L with 7 μg of Glu-C protease in 100 μl of buffer A for 15 min at 22 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding protease inhibitors at the same concentration as above. Transducin GTPase activity was determined by using either a multiple-turnover ([GTP] > [transducin]) or single-turnover ([GTP] < [transducin]) technique as described previously in Refs. 18Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar and 19Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, respectively. GTPase assays were conducted at room temperature (22–24 °C) in buffer A. uROS lacking the endogenous GAP activity of RGS9 were used as a source of rhodopsin for assaying the GAP activity of recombinant RGS9 constructs. Rhodopsin in these membranes was activated by illuminating the membranes on ice immediately before the experiments. The reaction was started by the addition of 10 μl of [γ-32P]GTP at desired concentration (∼105 dpm/sample) to 20 μl of membranes with transducin and RGS9-Gβ5L at required concentrations. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of 6% perchloric acid. 32Pi formation was measured with activated charcoal (19Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because both native and recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L interact much more efficiently with the complex of transducin with its effector, PDEγ, than with free activated transducin (13Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G.

This peptide has been shown to completely replace the full-length PDEγ in this assay (18Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol.

The ability of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L to interact with photoreceptor membranes was studied in three ROS preparations described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.1 A). No evidence of high affinity binding was obtained with either whole ROS or hypotonically washed ROShyp. However, a significant fraction of RGS9-Gβ5L was found bound to urea-treated uROS membranes. ROS and ROShyp are different from uROS because they contain a functionally active endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L, whereas RGS9-Gβ5L in uROS is completely inactivated (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 13Angleson J.K. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16290-16296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We suggest that treating photoreceptor membranes with urea caused the denaturation of endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L resulting in its dissociation from specific binding sites on the membranes. Consequently, these sites became available for the binding of exogenous recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L. This suggestion is further supported by the observation that membrane binding of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L also took place after treating ROS with alkaline sodium carbonate buffer (Fig. 1 B). This treatment has been previously shown to result in the extraction of endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L from photoreceptor membranes (8Cowan C.W. Fariss R.N. Sokal I. Palczewski K. Wensel T.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5351-5356Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). We then determined the amount of membrane-associated sites that are available for the binding of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L in uROS (Fig.2). We incubated various concentrations of RGS9-Gβ5L (ranging from 0.015 to 0.5 μm) with uROS membranes containing 60 μm rhodopsin and determined the amount of membrane-associated RGS9-Gβ5L after removing nonspecifically bound protein by two washes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding of RGS9-Gβ5L saturated at the ∼3.5 pmol level, which corresponds to 1 molecule of bound RGS9-Gβ5L/∼1700 molecules of rhodopsin. This value is within the range of the published RGS9/rhodopsin ratio in bovine ROS (1:1640 ± 620 from Ref. 7He W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Neuron. 1998; 20: 95-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Therefore, the maximal amount of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L that can bind to the specific sites in uROS membranes is approximately the same as the amount of native RGS9-Gβ5L originally present in these membranes. In the next set of experiments, we tested whether high affinity binding of RGS9-Gβ5L to photoreceptor membranes may involve a specific interaction with a protein component located in the photoreceptor membranes. The binding of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L was analyzed after proteolytic treatments of uROS membranes by trypsin or endoproteinase Glu-C (also known as protease V8). We choose trypsin as the most commonly used nonspecific protease and V8 as the protease previously reported to remove endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L from ROS membranes (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The treatment with either protease resulted in a complete loss of the uROS ability to bind RGS9-Gβ5L (Fig.3, A and B), indicating that the binding sites indeed contain a protein component. We then addressed whether the ability of RGS9-Gβ5L to specifically bind to photoreceptor membranes was also affected by its partial proteolysis by V8, as reported by He and colleagues (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). An experiment shown in Fig. 3 C indicates that a short treatment of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L by V8, using the protease concentration identical to that in Fig. 3 B, resulted in a formation of a single major proteolytic fragment with the molecular mass of ∼3 kDa lower than the mass of the full-length RGS9. This fragment could represent only the C-terminally truncated RGS9 because it was recognized by the antibodies against the N-terminal His6tag. This observation is in complete agreement with the data reported by He and colleagues (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to their report, the ability of the C-terminally truncated RGS9-Gβ5L to bind to membranes was essentially the same as that of the full-length protein. These data indicate that protease V8 releases RGS9-Gβ5L from photoreceptor membranes by proteolyzing its membrane-associated partner rather than RGS9-Gβ5L itself. In the next set of experiments, we analyzed the effects of RGS9-Gβ5L association with photoreceptor membranes on its ability to activate transducin GTPase. We first utilized the single-turnover GTPase methodology that has been ubiquitously used in studying transducin GTPase regulation in the past (cf. Ref. 19Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Arshavsky V.Y. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 524-538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The data in Fig. 4 indicate that, in the presence of excess RGS9-Gβ5L, the rate of GTP hydrolysis was limited by the amount of uROS present in the assay. No significant effect was observed when the concentration of uROS was increased in control experiments in the absence of RGS9-Gβ5L. Because the increase in the amount of uROS provided an increase in the number of specific sites for RGS9-Gβ5L binding, this observation supports the idea that, as RGS9 becomes membrane-bound, its activity increases. To quantify the degree of RGS9-Gβ5L activity stimulation by uROS, we used an alternative kinetic approach: multiple-turnover transducin GTPase assay. In this approach, the maximal catalytic activity of RGS9-Gβ5L (expressed as the number of transducin molecules whose GTPase activity may be stimulated by one RGS9-Gβ5L molecule per time unit) is determined when small catalytic amounts of RGS9-Gβ5L are supplemented by saturating concentrations of transducin and GTP (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar,18Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 5, maximal catalytic activity of RGS9-Gβ5L was determined at various amounts of uROS. The activity rose until saturation was achieved as the amount of uROS became sufficient to provide membrane binding sites for all RGS9-Gβ5L molecules present in the assay. Fitting the data with the Hill equation and dividing the obtained V maxvalue by the RGS9-Gβ5L concentration in the assay yielded the maximal catalytic activity of RGS9-Gβ5L equal to ∼26 turnovers/s. Further support of the hypothesis that membrane binding stimulates the catalytic activity of RGS9-Gβ5L comes from the data shown in Fig.6. We measured the rates of multiple-turnover transducin GTPase at various RGS9-Gβ5L concentrations under experimental conditions essentially replicating those used to determine the concentration dependence of RGS9-Gβ5L association with uROS membranes in Fig. 2. The rate of GTP hydrolysis rose sharply before RGS9-Gβ5L concentration reached ∼50 nm, after which its increase slowed by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. This concentration corresponds to practically the same amount of RGS9-Gβ5L as the maximal amount of RGS9-Gβ5L bound to uROS membranes in Fig. 2. Therefore, we conclude that RGS9-Gβ5L association with specific sites on the photoreceptor membranes leads to a dramatic stimulation of its ability to activate transducin GTPase. This conclusion is also consistent with the observation that removing the excess of nonbound RGS9-Gβ5L by membrane sedimentation did not reliably reduce the rate of transducin GTPase measured with these membranes in similar assays (we used 1 μm RGS9-Gβ5L in these experiments; data not shown). The degree of RGS9-Gβ5L activity stimulation caused by RGS9-Gβ5L membrane association was estimated from the ratio of the slopes of linear regression fits to the data before and after the slowdown point in Fig. 6. This ratio was equal to ∼70, provided that the steep slope was 26 ± 2 (mol of GTP)·(mol of RGS9-Gβ5L)−1·s−1 (S.E.) and the shallow slope was 0.36 ± 0.1 (mol of GTP)·(mol of RGS9-Gβ5L)−1·s−1. The role of individual domains of RGS9 in the membrane binding of RGS9-Gβ5L was addressed in experiments with a series of deletion mutants lacking various structural elements of RGS9. We used the same recombinant constructs as in a previous study, where we examined the role of these domains in regulating RGS9-Gβ5L catalytic activity (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We conducted this analysis only with recombinant constructs possessing the catalytic activity of RGS9 to avoid potential artifacts resulting from misfolding of protein fragments. Schematic illustrations of RGS9 domain composition and protein constructs used in these experiments are drawn in Fig.7 A (see Refs. 4Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N., Jr. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar and 22Cowan C.W., He, W. Wensel T.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 65: 341-359Crossref Google Scholar for recent reviews on RGS9 domain structure). The N-terminal domain of RGS9 containing ∼110 amino acids is called DEP because highly homologous domains are also present in disheveled, EGL-10, and pleckstrin. DEP is followed by an ∼80-amino acid sequence with the lowest degree of homology to other members of the RGS protein family, which we term “interdomain.” The next domain of ∼80 residues is the G protein gsubunit-like domain (GGL), which provides the binding site for Gβ5L. GGL is followed by the RGS homology domain of ∼120 residues and finally by the C-terminal extension of ∼50 residues that is often called C-terminal domain. Because it has been previously shown that the expression of all RGS9 constructs containing GGL domain in soluble form was possible only in the presence of Gβ5 (21He W., Lu, L.S. Zhang X., El Hodiri H.M. Chen C.K. Slep K.C. Simon M.I. Jamrich M. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37093-37100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we co-expressed all GGL domain-containing RGS9 constructs with Gβ5L. We conducted membrane-binding assays at the relatively low, 15 nm concentration of the RGS9-Gβ5L constructs so that the amount of binding sites within the uROS membranes was sufficient to bind all RGS9-Gβ5L present. The data of Fig. 7 B indicate that the construct lacking the C-terminal domain of RGS9 binds to uROS as well as the full-length recombinant protein. To the contrary, no membrane association was observed with the constructs lacking either DEP alone or both DEP and the interdomain. The lack of membrane association for these constructs was also observed at the 10-fold higher construct concentrations used in similar assays (data not shown). These data clearly demonstrate that the DEP domain of RGS9 but not its C terminus is essential for RGS9-Gβ5L association with specific binding sites within the photoreceptor membranes. Interestingly, the DEP domain alone did not show any sign of membrane binding (Fig. 7 C). This may be explained by the requirement of the other structural elements of RGS9-Gβ5L for membrane association, although a possibility of the DEP domain misfolding could not be ruled out as well. The central observation of this study is that specific binding of RGS9-Gβ5L to proteinaceous sites within the photoreceptor membranes enhances its ability to activate transducin GTPase by approximately 2 orders of magnitude. The absolute catalytic activity of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L achieved upon its membrane association is ∼26 turnovers/s, which is on the same order as the activity of native RGS9-Gβ5L (98 ± 40 s−1 from Ref. 18Skiba N.P. Hopp J.A. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32716-32720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In combination with recent findings that recombinant and native RGS9-Gβ5L have the same affinity for transducin and the same degree of cooperation with PDEγ (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this observation indicates that the catalytic properties of recombinant and native RGS9-Gβ5L are very similar. In fact, the difference between the catalytic activities of native and recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L may be even smaller than it appears. It may be explained by assuming that some of the recombinant protein used in this study was not functionally active but retained its ability to bind to the protein anchor in the uROS membranes, whereas the entire concentration of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L was used in the calculations of catalytic activity. It may be also accounted for by some unavoidable inaccuracies in protein concentration determinations employed in either case. Our data also clarify a discrepancy raised in previous investigations with recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L. It has been consistently noted that its absolute catalytic activity was significantly lower than the activity of native protein from rod outer segments (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21He W., Lu, L.S. Zhang X., El Hodiri H.M.

For example, the maximal activity of only ∼1.8 turnovers/s was reported for recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L studied in the multiple turnover GTPase assays (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We now understand that the amount of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L used in that and most other investigations by far exceeded the capacity of specific binding sites within the uROS membranes present in the assays. As a result, RGS9-Gβ5L was likely to be distributed between a small fraction of the membrane-bound protein with high catalytic activity and a large fraction of unbound protein whose activity was very low. Thus, the number of 1.8 s−1 reflected an average activity of all RGS9-Gβ5L molecules present in those assays and not the activity of the most active fraction associated with the membranes. RGS9 is one of the most intensively studied representative of the RGS protein subfamily whose members share similar domain composition and exist as complexes with Gβ5 (reviewed in Refs.4Arshavsky V.Y. Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N., Jr. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 153-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 22Cowan C.W., He, W. Wensel T.G. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

Several recent publications have significantly advanced our understanding of structure-function relations within the catalytic domain of RGS9 (24Slep K.C. Kercher M.A., He, W. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. Sigler P.B. Nature. 2001; 409: 1071-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 25Sowa M.E., He, W. Slep K.C. Kercher M.A. Lichtarge O. Wensel T.G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 234-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Functional roles of the other structures of RGS9 and Gβ5L remain poorly understood, although two independent studies indicate that all of them are important for regulating the activity of the RGS catalytic domain (6Skiba N.P. Martemyanov K.A. Elfenbein A. Hopp J.A. Bohm A. Simonds W.F. Arshavsky V.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37365-37372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 21He W., Lu, L.S.

These studies argue that noncatalytic domains of the RGS9-Gβ5L complex, including the DEP domain, contribute to its ability to interact preferentially with the transducin-PDEγ complex as opposed to activated transducin alone. The data presented in Fig. 7 of this study indicate that another function of the DEP domain of RGS9 is to enable RGS9-Gβ5L to bind tightly to specific sites within the photoreceptor membranes. The amount of these binding sites is limited, and in rod outer segments they are all occupied by endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L. The high affinity DEP-dependent membrane association of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L becomes possible only after endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L is either extracted or denatured. The specificity of this association is supported by two considerations. First, this association is resistant to the same membrane treatments as the membrane association of native RGS9-Gβ5L. Second, the catalytic activity of membrane-bound recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L is on the same order as the activity of native protein, whereas the activity of nonbound RGS9-Gβ5L is much lower. The properties of the high affinity RGS9-Gβ5L membrane association revealed in this study allow us to understand an apparent contradiction between our conclusion that the binding requires the N-terminal DEP domain and the recent report by He and colleagues (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), who argue for the crucial role of the C-terminal domain of RGS9 in binding. We noted that ROS membranes used by He and colleagues were prepared in a way that retained the intactness of endogenous RGS9-Gβ5L. Thus, their membranes were unlikely to contain high affinity sites available for the binding of recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L and its deletion mutants. Therefore, we conclude that recombinant RGS9-Gβ5L in that study was not bound to the same sites that we studied here, the sites to which the native RGS9-Gβ5L is normally bound. Furthermore, we did not observe wash-resistant RGS9-Gβ5L binding to non-urea-treated membranes, which He and colleagues described, although exact explanation for this difference is not clear. Another argument by He and colleagues (9He W. Melia T.J. Cowan C.W. Wensel T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48961-48966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) in favor of the role of RGS9 C terminus in RGS9-Gβ5L membrane attachment was that essentially only C-terminally cleaved RGS9 was released from ROS membranes upon their proteolytic digestion by protease V8. Our data (Fig. 3) indicate that the effect of V8 protease on the RGS9-Gβ5L membrane attachment originates from the proteolysis of the protein component of membrane-associated binding sites rather than from the C-terminal proteolysis of RGS9. In this context, it is logical to assume that, although the C terminus of RGS9 is not important for binding the anchor protein, it is protected from proteolysis when RGS9-Gβ5L is membrane-bound. The proteolysis of the membrane anchor leading to the release of RGS9-Gβ5L from membranes to solution may significantly increase the accessibility of RGS9 C terminus to V8 protease. In summary, our data indicate that the membrane attachment of RGS9-Gβ5L in photoreceptors serves not only as a means to contain it in the appropriate intracellular compartment, but also serves as a crucial determinant of its catalytic activity. The goal of the future experiments is to identify the membrane-associated anchoring protein for RGS9-Gβ5L and to elucidate the mechanism by which it regulates RGS9-Gβ5L activity. We thank Dr. T. G. Wensel for critical comments on the manuscript."

This virulon, which is encoded by a plasmid called pYV in Yersinia enterocolitica, enables extracellular bacteria to inject six Yop effectors (YopE, -H, -T, -O, -P, -M) into the host cell. To investigate the role of YopP, YopM, and the other pYV-encoded factors on the expression of the host cell genes, we characterized the transcriptome alterations in infected mouse macrophages using the microarray technique. PU5–1.8 macrophages were infected either with an avirulent (pYV−), a wild type (pYV+), or two knockout (yopP − andyopM −) mutants of Y. enterocolitica. Expression alterations in response to Y. enterocolitica infection were monitored for 6657 genes. Among those, 857 genes were affected, 339 of which were specifically regulated by the action of the Yop virulon. Further analysis of those 339 genes allowed identification of specific targets of YopP, YopM, or the other pYV-encoded factors. According to these results, the main action of the Yop virulon is to counteract the host cell pro-inflammatory response to the infection. YopP participates to this inhibition, whereas another pYV-encoded factor appears to also be involved in this down-regulation. Besides, YopM was found to induce the regulation of genes involved in cell cycle and cell growth, revealing for the first time an in vitro effect for YopM. In addition to YopM, other pYV factors distinct from YopP affected the expression of genes involved in cycling.

Various pathogenesis mechanisms have evolved in parallel to different bacterial life styles,e.g. extracellular or intracellular. The genusYersinia includes three species (Yersinia pestis,Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and Yersinia enterocolitica) that are pathogenic for rodents and humans (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite their different routes of infection, they are all mainly extracellular bacteria and share a common tropism for lymphoid tissues and a capacity to resist the innate immune response. This capacity is linked to the Yop virulon, a powerful weapon encoded by a virulence plasmid, called pYV in Y. enterocolitica. This plasmid encodes a complete type III secretion system and the secreted proteins (called Yop) with their chaperones (1Cornelis G.R. Boland A. Boyd A.P. Geuijen C. Iriarte M. Neyt C. Sory M.P. Stainier I. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1315-1352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Y. enterocolitica possesses two adhesins, one chromosomally encoded (invasin) and one pYV-encoded (YadA), which allow a close contact with eukaryotic cells. This type III secretion system enables extracellular bacteria adhering to their host cell to insert a pore in the plasma membrane (involving LcrV, YopB, YopD (2Holmstrom A. Olsson J. Cherepanov P.

Although the precise role of some of the six Yops is still not clear, most of them (YopE, -H, -O, -M) have been shown to be necessary for full virulence ofY. enterocolitica in the mouse infection model. The Yop effectors can be divided into three functional groups. Four Yops (-E, -H, -T, -O) disorganize the host cytoskeleton and block bacterial phagocytosis by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes. 1Grosdent, N., Maridonneau-Parini, I., Sory, M. P., and Cornelis, G. R. (2002) Infect. Immun., in press. YopE, YopT, and YopO (YpkA in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) depolymerize the actin filaments by acting on different Rho GTPases (4Dukuzumuremyi J.M. Rosqvist R. Hallberg B. Akerstrom B.

In addition to its role on cytoskeleton destabilization, YopH was recently shown to inhibit the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, leading to the inhibition of T lymphocytes proliferation (10Yao T. Mecsas J. Healy J.I. Falkow S. Chien Y. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). 2Sauvonnet, N., Lambermont, I., van der Bruggen, I. P., and Cornelis, G. R. (2002) Mol. Microbiol., in press. YopP (YopJ in Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis) blocks the NF-κB pathway by preventing the activation of IκB kinase β. This abolishes the migration of NF-κB to the nucleus, thereby abrogating the onset of the pro-inflammatory response (11Schesser K. Spiik A.K. Dukuzumuremyi J.M. Neurath M.F. Pettersson S. Wolf-Watz H. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1067-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Besides, YopP inactivates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)3 pathway by inhibiting MAPK kinases (MKKs) activation, which leads to the inhibition of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, implicated in the activation of different transcription factors (12Orth K. Palmer L.E. Bao Z.Q. Stewart S. Rudolph A.E. Bliska J.B. Dixon J.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1920-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Finally, YopP induces apoptosis in macrophages, but it is still not clear if this results from a specific induction of a death pathway (13Denecker G. Declercq W. Geuijen C.A. Boland A.

Trulzsch K. Rouot B. Heesemann J. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 1823-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Although YopM plays an important role in pathogenesis in vivo (15Leung K.Y. Reisner B.S. Straley S.C. Infect. Immun. 1990; 58: 3262-3271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its function is still unknown. YopM, mainly composed of leucine-rich repeats, has been shown to migrate into the nucleus (16Skrzypek E. Cowan C. Straley S.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 30: 1051-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that it could play a role in the regulation of host cell DNA transcription or replication. However, thus far such a role remains to be demonstrated. Global analysis of gene expression has been used recently to characterize the response of human neutrophils to Y. pestisinfection (17Subrahmanyam Y.V. Yamaga S. Prashar Y. Lee H.H. Hoe N.P. Kluger Y. Gerstein M. Goguen J.D. Newburger P.E. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Here, we used the microarray technique to define more precisely the individual effects of Yop effectors on host cell mRNA expression. Because macrophages together with polymorphonuclear leukocytes are the first line of defense against invading organisms, we decided to analyze gene expression in PU5–1.8 mouse macrophages in response to Y. enterocolitica infection. To identify the role of the specific Y. enterocolitica virulence factors, we compared mRNA expression of non-infected macrophages with macrophages infected by either an avirulent (pYV−), a wild type (pYV+), or two knockout bacteria,yopP− , to better characterize the role of YopP on the regulation of pro-inflammatory genes, andyopM− , to investigate whether this effector is involved in host cell transcription regulation. The bacterial strains used were the wild type Y. enterocolitica serotype O:9 MRS40 (pYV40) (called pYV+) and its plasmid-cured derivative (called pYV−) (18Sarker M.R. Neyt C. Stainier I. Cornelis G.R. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1207-1214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two single knockout mutants MRS40 (pMSK41) (called yopP− ) and MRS40 (pAB408) (calledyopM− ) were described previously (19Mills S.D. Boland A. Sory M.P. van der Smissen P. Kerbourch C. Finlay B.B. Cornelis G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12638-12643Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). All the strains were currently grown in brain-heart infusion at 25 °C with the appropriate antibiotics, 35 μg/ml nalidixic acid, and 1 mm arsenite. The PU5–1.8 mouse macrophage-like cell line was currently cultivated in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2. Before infection Y. enterocolitica were grown in brain-heart infusion for 2h at 25 °C and then for 30 min at 37 °C to ensure Yop virulon expression. PU5–1.8 cells (1.5 × 107) were cultivated in cell suspension in the same medium as before but without antibiotic and infected with bacteria at a multiplicity of infection of 50:1 for 2.5 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2. Cytoplasmic RNAs were prepared using the Nonidet P-40 method as described (20Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. 1. Academic Press, Inc., London1997: 389-406Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (1×) and lysed in 1 ml of cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm dithiothreitol and 500 units/ml RNasin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Nuclei and mitochondria were removed by brief centrifugation (20 s at 10,000 × g), and proteins were digested with 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Merck) in the presence of 1% SDS and 10 mm EDTA. After phenol/chloroform extraction, RNAs were precipitated with 2.5 volumes of EtOH (100%) in the presence of 0.3 m sodium acetate. RNA quality was checked by Northern blotting and hybridization with a probe specific for β-actin mRNA. For Northern blot analysis, RNA samples were separated by electrophoresis through formaldehyde denaturing 1.2% agarose gels and transferred onto nylon membranes (GeneScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) (21Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. 1. Academic Press, Inc., London1997: 407-424Google Scholar). rRNA distribution was visualized by methylene blue staining, and Northern blots were hybridized sequentially with DNA probes synthesized by random priming using the Megaprime II kit (Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP. Probe templates from I.M.A.G.E. clones (I.M.A.G.E. clones 1139544, 5325073, 573898, and 4486098) were generated by insert digestion and purification after verification of the clone identity by sequencing. Hybridizations were performed overnight at 42 °C followed by washes as described (21Müllner E.W. Garcia-Sanz J.A. Lefkovits I. Immunology Methods Manual. 1. Academic Press, Inc., London1997: 407-424Google Scholar), and the last wash was performed at 65 °C for 30 min in 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 1% SDS. Signals were detected and quantified by phosphorimaging (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). For cRNA synthesis, 30 μg of cytoplasmic RNAs from either non-infected or infected PU5–1.8 were used as templates for double-stranded cDNA synthesis using the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) and a T7-(dT)24 primer according to Affymetrix instructions. After purification, double-stranded cDNAs were used as template for in vitroT7 transcription using the Bioarray high yield transcript labeling kit (Enzo). cRNA synthesis yields, as monitored by spectrophotometry, were highly similar in the different samples (typically 8–10 μg of cRNA/μg of cytoplasmic RNA used, corresponding to roughly a 300-fold amplification). 20 μg of each cRNA population were fragmented. First, 5 μg were used as target for the Te3 test chip to check the quality of the target. Subsequently, 15 μg were used for hybridization of the murine genome GeneChip probe arrays U74Av2 (both arrays from Affymetrix). Hybridization, washes, antibody amplification, and staining were performed using the Affymetrix fluidics station and scanner following the manufacturer's instructions. Analysis of the raw data was performed using Affymetrix Suite software. Further analysis were performed using the Excel and GeneCluster (available at www.genome.wi.mit.edu/MPR/software.html) software. To characterize the specific effects of the Y. enterocolitica Yop virulon on the host cell transcriptome, we analyzed gene expression of infected PU5–1.8 murine macrophages. A preliminary kinetic analysis showed that a 2.5-h infection with wild type (pYV+) Y. enterocolitica was sufficient to elicit a robust effect on the inflammatory response, as monitored by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) mRNA level and induced less than 10% of apoptosis, as monitored by propidium iodide incorporation (data not shown). Because one early effect of apoptosis induction is the degradation of cellular mRNAs, 4J. del Prete, M. S. Robles, A. Guio, C. Martinez-A, M. Izquierdo, and J. A. Garcia-Sanz, submitted for publication. this point was critical to ensure extraction of high quality, undegraded cytoplasmic RNAs. We analyzed mRNA expression from macrophages infected for 2.5 h with pYV−, pYV+,yopP− , and yopM− bacteria, and non-infected PU5–1.8 macrophages. After infection, cytoplasmic RNAs were extracted to monitor the variations of mature mRNAs by the Affymetrix GeneChip system. We used the oligonucleotide probe array MG-U74Av2, which allows measurement of the expression levels of about 6000 mRNAs and 6000 Expressed Sequence Tags (EST; for simplification, we use the word “gene” indifferently for known genes or EST). In each experiment, the number of mRNA species detected (called “present” by the Affymetrix Suite analysis software) was about 40–46%, and the analysis was carried out on 6657 genes. In every experiment, the mean signal intensities were arbitrarily adjusted to 150. The dynamic range of the data as well as the signal distributions were very similar, all encompassing more than 4 orders of magnitude (Fig. 1), hence validating the reliability of the microarray experiments. According to those distributions, the background was empirically set to 20 so that the genes with data values below this threshold were considered to have undetectable mRNA expression levels. Furthermore, Affymetrix array values for most of the so-called “housekeeping genes” such as β-actin and elongation factor 1α (EF1α) were found to be similar in the five conditions, coherent with the results obtained by Northern blot hybridizations (Fig.2). Those Northern blots were performed with RNA from three different infection experiments to check the reproducibility of the results.Figure 2Regulation of mRNA expression as monitored by Northern blot is in agreement with the Affymetrix data analysis. 10 μg of total RNA from PU5–1.8 either non-infected (N) or infected for 2.5h with Y. enterocoliticapYV− (−), pYV+ (+),yopP− (P),andyopM− (M) were separated by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membrane (see “Experimental Procedures”). Hybridization with probes specific for elongation factor 1α (EF1α), β-actin, IL-1β, TNF-α, p75 TNF receptor (TNFR2), small inducible cytokine A2 (MCP-1), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1rn) reveal the specific expression patterns in each condition, which are in full agreement with the results obtained from Affymetrix array data.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) First we compared the microarray hybridization data from the non-infected PU5–1.8 cells with those from cells infected with pYV−or pYV+ bacteria. Genes were considered as not regulated and, hence, were discarded from the analysis if they did not show any significant variation of their expression level in the cells infected by the pYV− or the pYV+ bacteria, as compared with the non-infected cells (i.e. ratio values <2 or difference between the values <30). This yielded a data set of 857 genes regulated upon Y. enterocolitica infection, representing nearly 13% of the 6,657 genes analyzed. To cluster genes according to the variation pattern of their mRNA level, self-organizing maps (SOMs) analyses were performed using the GeneCluster software (23Tamayo P. Slonim D. Mesirov J. Zhu Q. Kitareewan S. Dmitrovsky E. Lander E.S. Golub T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2907-2912Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar), resulting in the identification of eight different groups of genes (Fig. 3 and www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/cornelis/manuscript/Folder_1.html). The first two clusters, called A and B, gathered 518 genes that were similarly expressed in cells infected with pYV− and pYV+ bacteria but differently in the non-infected cells (Fig. 3). Thus, these variations represented the PU5–1.8 macrophage response to the bacterial infection, which was not modulated by the Yop virulon. Supporting this interpretation, we found numerous genes encoding cytokines and other pro-inflammatory proteins in the cluster A, which gathers genes up-regulated in pYV−- and pYV+-infected cells (see Folder 1). These included the small inducible cytokines A3 (SCYA3; J0BB91), A5 (SCYA5; AF0659B7), and A6 (SCYA6; M5800B), interleukin 1 (IL-1) α and β (M1B639 and M15131), and the macrophage inflammatory proteins 1b and 2 (MIP-1b, X62502; MIP-2, X53798), most of which are up-regulated after infections with bacteria as diverse as Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Bordetella pertussis, orSalmonella (17Subrahmanyam Y.V.

As an example, Northern blot analysis of IL-1β mRNA expression was in complete agreement with the microarray data (Fig. 2). Besides, cluster A enclosed less predictable factors also involved in immune response, such as the complement component C3 (K02782), which plays a central role in phagocytosis (27Griffin F.M., Jr. Griffin J.A. Leider J.E. Silverstein S.C. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 1263-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), and Fas receptor (M836B9), which is up-regulated in macrophages after activation, as a mechanism of negative feed-back (28Niinobu T. Fukuo K. Yasuda O. Tsubakimoto M. Mogi M. Nishimaki H. Morimoto S. Ogihara T. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: 504-509Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cluster B, corresponding to the cluster A-inverted pattern, we found numerous genes encoding intracellular signaling proteins among which the diacylglycerol kinase α (GenBankTMAF085219). Diacylglycerol kinase α is involved in phosphatidylinositol triphosphates synthesis and, although it has long been considered as a housekeeping gene, recent analysis in mice reveals that diacylglycerol kinase α mRNA is down-regulated after T lymphocyte activation. 5M. A. Sanjuán, B. Pradet-Balade, D. R. Jones, C. Martı́nez-A, J. A. Garcia-Sanz, and I. Mérida, submitted for publication. A previous study of the neutrophil transcriptome during Y. pestis infection showed that some cytokines (namely, SCYA3, MIP-2, IL-1α and -β) are up-regulated in the pCD1−(pYV− analogous)-infected neutrophils but not in the pCD1+ (pYV+ analogous) ones (17Subrahmanyam Y.V. Yamaga S. Prashar Y. Lee H.H. Hoe N.P. Kluger Y. Gerstein M. Goguen J.D. Newburger P.E. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This result contrasts with our finding that those genes were up-regulated in bothY. enterocolitica pYV−- and pYV+-infected macrophages (cluster A, Fig. 3). This discrepancy can be explained by differences between the two infected cell types (human neutrophils versus mouse macrophage cell line). Indeed, the same authors show transcriptome variations between monocytes and neutrophils infected by E. coli (17Subrahmanyam Y.V. Yamaga S. Prashar Y. Lee H.H. Hoe N.P. Kluger Y. Gerstein M. Goguen J.D. Newburger P.E. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This divergence could also result from the fact that two different Yersinia species were used (Y. pestis versus Y. enterocolitica). In fact, at least for IL-1α, it was recently reported that its gene was up-regulated in macrophages infected by wild type Y. enterocolitica (30Dube P.H. Revell P.A. Chaplin D.D. Lorenz R.G. Miller V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10880-10885Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Finally, because 60% of the identified regulated genes belong to clusters A and B, the majority of the alterations in gene expression that take place in Y. enterocolitica-infected cells represents the macrophage response to the bacterial infection independently of the Yop virulon (Fig. 3). The six other clusters (C–H) regrouped 339 genes whose mRNA levels differed in cells infected by the pYV+ from that infected by the pYV−bacteria (Fig. 3 and www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/cornelis/manuscript, Folder 1). Those genes were, thus, specifically regulated by factors encoded by theY. enterocolitica pYV plasmid. Strikingly, the majority of these genes were found in clusters C and F (198 on 339, i.e.58% of the pYV-regulated genes). These two clusters gathered genes up (F)- or down (C)-regulated after pYV− infection but on which the pYV-encoded factors induced a deregulation so that the mRNA expression level in pYV+-infected cells was similar to that in the non-infected cells (Fig. 3). This most likely represents a specific mechanism by which Y. enterocolitica counteracts the macrophage activation, by shutting down the host cell response. Because most of the genes identified as specifically regulated by the Yop virulon belong to this category, one of the most important functions accomplished by the pYV-encoded factors seems to be to counteract the host cell response to the infection. This is in agreement with previous observations made on neutrophils infected by Y. pestis, where more genes showed altered expression in pYV−-infected cells than in pYV+-infected ones (17Subrahmanyam Y.V. Yamaga S. Prashar Y. Lee H.H. Hoe N.P. Kluger Y. Gerstein M. Goguen J.D. Newburger P.E. Weissman S.M. Blood. 2001; 97: 2457-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism by which the Yop virulon regulates the host cell transcriptome, PU5–1.8 cells were infected with the Y. enterocolitica yopP− andyopM− strains in which the genes encoding YopP or YopM have been knocked out. mRNA expression of the 339 genes previously identified as specifically regulated by pYV-encoded factors (clusters C-H) were analyzed in non-infected cells and cells infected with the four Y. enterocolitica strains. Again, SOMs were generated to cluster genes following their pattern of mRNA expression. This analysis yielded as many as 24 different clusters, some of which could not be interpreted by the sole effect of YopP or YopM or of the other pYV-encoded factors. For this reason, we decided to concentrate on the patterns that undoubtedly displayed the effect of either (i) YopP, (ii) YopM, or (iii) the other factors encoded by the pYV plasmid. This global analysis, taking simultaneously into account the five different conditions, is more stringent than the comparison of expression profiles two by two (i.e. pYV+ versus yopP− ) and, thus, should yield more reliable results concerning the target genes controlled by the different Y. enterocolitica effectors. Genes were considered as specifically regulated by YopP action if they were expressed at similar levels in pYV+ andyopM− -infected cells on one side and in pYV− and yopP −-infected cells on the other side. Four clusters (I, J,K, L), which represent 59 genes, fulfill this criterion (Fig. 4, TableI, www.biozentrum.unibas.ch/cornelis/manuscript/Folder_2.html). Fig. 2shows the Northern hybridization of two YopP targets, TNF-α and TNF receptor 2, which expression correlates with the profiles determined by Affymetrix chip hybridization.Table IPU5–1.8 macrophage genes regulated by YopP actionAccession No.DescriptionClusterCytokine/growth factor D84196Tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)I AJ011967Growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15, SBF)IReceptor X87128p75 TNF receptor (TNFR2)I M89641Interferon (α/β) receptor (IFN α/βR)I U59430Neuropeptide Y receptor Y6 (NPY6R)KCell surface protein AF030454Epithelial V-like antigen (EVA)K X00652Ig-kappa light chain V-J κK AI843313Glypican-3 precursor (GPC3)K AF016308Histocompatibility 2, M region locus 9 (H2-M9)KSignaling L07924Guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator for Ras-related GTPase (Rgds)I L35302TNF receptor-associated factor1 (Traf1)I U88328suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3)I AF013490Protein-tyrosine phosphatase (MEG2)J AV226788Dual specificity tyrosine phosphatase 8 (DUS8)K X61940Growth factor-inducible immediate early (MKP-1)L U67187G protein signaling regulator (RGS2)LTranscription U20735Transcription factor junBI AF017021Basic leucine zipper transcription factor, ATF-like (B-ATF)I U57524I kappa B alpha (1 κBα)I X76858E4F transcription factor 1 (E4F1)K U60453Enhancer of zeste homolog 1 (Ezh1)LGrowth arrest and apoptosis U19463Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 3 (A20, TN Flp3)I L24118Tumor necrosis factor-induced protein 2 (TNFlp2)I U00937Growth arrest and DNA damage-induced 45 (GADD45)I X51829Myeloid differentiation primary response (Myd116)IProtein synthesis/degradation U79962TAR RNA-binding protein 2 (TARBP2)I M98036Guanine nucleotide exchange factor delta (elF2B)I M60320Protein-l-isoaspartate (d-aspartate) O-methyltran ferase1 (PCMT1)J U57692N-terminal Asn amidohydrolase (PNAD)JIntracellular traffic AI592541Tripartite motif protein 13 (Trim13)I AF053473kinesin heavy chain (KIF5B)KMetabolism AV174870Aspartyl aminopeptidase (Dnpep)I X61147Aconitase 1(trp1, Aco-1)K AI843947ATP synthase mitochondrial (ATP5j2)K Y1573317-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 7 (HSD17b7)L M37831Cytochrome c oxidase, subunit IV (COXIV)LECM/cytoskeleton AF041448Advillin (DOC6)I M15832Proc"

Previously theArabidopsis Ca2+/H+ transporter, CAX1 (cation exchanger 1), was identified by its ability to suppress yeast mutants defective in vacuolar Ca2+ transport. Recently, a 36-amino acid N-terminal regulatory region on CAX1 has been identified that inhibits CAX1-mediated Ca2+/H+antiport. Here we show that a synthetic peptide designed against the CAX1 36 amino acids inhibited Ca2+/H+ transport mediated by an N-terminal-truncated CAX1 but did not inhibit Ca2+ transport by other Ca2+/H+antiporters. Ca2+/H+ antiport activity measured from vacuolar-enriched membranes of Arabidopsis root was also inhibited by the CAX1 peptide. Through analyzing CAX chimeric constructs the region of interaction of the N-terminal regulatory region was mapped to include 7 amino acids (residues 56–62) within CAX1. The CAX1 N-terminal regulatory region was shown to physically interact with this 7-amino acid region by yeast two-hybrid analysis. Mutagenesis of amino acids within the N-terminal regulatory region implicated several residues as being essential for regulation.

Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 395-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Ca2+/Na+ antiporters in animal cells and Ca2+/H+ antiporters in bacteria, yeast, and plants also mediate efflux of Ca2+ (3Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar, 4Hirschi K.D. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 100-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The antiporters are high capacity, low affinity Ca2+ transporters that are very efficient at removing the transient cytosolic Ca2+spikes that occur during a signaling event (5Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aielli D.P., Fu, L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is therefore important to determine the mechanisms of regulation of all of these Ca2+ transporters. Many animal and plant Ca-ATPases are regulated by calmodulin binding to a C-terminal or N-terminal autoinhibitor (2Harper J.F.

Ca2+/Na+ antiporters are regulated by intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+ and are activated by a variety of modulators such as protein kinase C (3Blaustein M.P. Lederer W.J. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 763-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (1464) Google Scholar). However, we still know little about the regulation of Ca2+/H+ antiporters (4Hirschi K.D.

Two Ca2+/H+antiporters of Arabidopsis thaliana, CAX1 and CAX2, were identified by their ability to suppress the Ca2+sensitivity of a S. cerevisiae mutant lacking the vacuolar Ca-ATPase PMC1 and the Ca2+/H+ antiporter VCX1 (9Hirschi K.D.

In addition, Arabidopsis has other putative cation exchanger (CAX)1 proteins (15Mäser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D.

Hirschi K.D. Gene. 2000; 257: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). As recent studies demonstrate with CAX2, these antiporters may also transport other metals (18Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A central question is how these transporters are modulated to affect ion homeostasis. Two domains that control CAX1 activity have been identified (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The first domain that regulates Ca2+/H+antiport function has been termed the regulatory or autoinhibitory domain (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We recently identified a CAX1 open reading frame (previously termed long-CAX1) that contains an additional 36 amino acids at the N terminus (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). These amino acids were not found in the original clone identified by suppression of the yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport mutant (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8782-8786Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This longer version of CAX1 localizes to the yeast vacuole, but does not transport Ca2+even in the presence of calmodulin (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis suggests that an N-terminal regulatory region (NRR) may be present in allArabidopsis CAX transporters. Using a series of N-terminal-truncated CAX (sCAX) chimeric constructs, a second domain, the Ca2+ domain (CaD), has been identified that appears to modulate Ca2+ transport (19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). CAX3 and CAX4 can strongly suppress yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport mutants if the 9-amino acid CaD of CAX1 is inserted into N-terminal-truncated versions of these transporters (sCAX3-9 and sCAX4-9; Refs. 17Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar and 19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Alternatively, both CAX3 and CAX4 can suppress yeast vacuolar Ca2+ transport mutants if N-terminal additions are made to these transporters (17Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 128: 1245-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These findings imply that CAX-dependent Ca2+ transport depends on N-terminal modifications; however, the nature of the N-terminal regulation remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that a peptide corresponding to the 36 amino acids of the CAX1 N terminus can specifically inhibit CAX1-mediated Ca2+/H+ transport in yeast cells and Ca2+-treated Arabidopsis roots. We identify individual amino acids within the N terminus that are important for this autoinhibition and map a region of CAX1 to which the NRR interacts. This novel autoinhibitory mechanism suggests that plants judiciously regulate Ca2+/H+ transport and suggest a means to engineer plant Ca2+ transport. CAX1 mutants were produced by PCR site-directed mutagenesis (20Shigaki T. Hirschi K.D. Anal.

The chimeric clones sCAX3-A, sCAX3-9, and sCAX3-A2 were constructed in a previous study and were called CAX3-α, CAX3-9, and CAX3-α2 respectively (19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J.

The chimeric clone sCAX1-A1 was constructed using a HindIII site within the coding sequences of CAX1 and CAX3. sCAX1-9 was produced using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCCCCTTGGATATTTGGACTTAGC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCCAAGGCTTACTATCTATCATGTAGTGGACCAAAATGGCGGCAGGTATGGCC-3′. sCAX3-9-2aa and sCAX1-A1-2aa mutants were produced using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCCTGAGAGTGATCCAGAAGGTACCATGCAAAACTCTC-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCTCTCAGGTCTGATTTCTTC-3′. sCAX3-9-7aa and sCAX1-A1-7aa mutants were produced using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCGTTCCATACAAAGGTTTAAAAGATTTTCTCTCTAATCTTCAAGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCTGGAACTTTCTGAACCAA-3′. CAX1-7aa and sCAX1-7aa mutants were produced using the following primers: forward, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCTGTTCCATGCAAAACTTTAAAGAACATTCTCTCTAATCTCCAAGAA-3′ and reverse, 5′-GAATTCCGTCTCTGGAACCTTCTGAATCAC-3′. All constructs were completely sequenced then subcloned into the yeast expression vector piHGpd (21Nathan D.F. Vos M.H. Lindquist S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1409-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The CAX2 clone used in this study is identical to the clone initially identified (9Hirschi K.D. Zhen R.-G. Cunningham K.W. Rea P.A. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The yeast strain K667 (cnb1::LEU2 pmc1::TRP1 vcx1Δ; Ref. 12Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) was transformed and grown as described previously (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D.

Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Yeast vacuolar-enriched membrane vesicles were prepared as previously described (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis membrane vesicles were prepared from root tissue obtained from 4-week-old plants cultured in Gamborg's B5 medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pretreated with 100 mm CaCl2 18 h prior to harvest. Microsomal membranes were isolated as described (22Uemura M. Joseph R.A. Steponkus P.L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 15-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Then, vacuolar-enriched vesicles were prepared as for yeast. Measurements of time-dependent45Ca2+/H+ transport into endomembrane vesicles were performed as previously described (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), except 5 μm carbonyl cyanidep-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone (FCCP) was used instead of gramicidin for the Arabidopsis transport assay. Synthetic peptides were synthesized (Dept. of Immunology, Baylor College of Medicine) by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid phase synthesis and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). To measure Ca2+ transport in the presence of a synthetic peptide, membrane vesicles were incubated with or without the peptide for 10 min at 25 °C prior to the addition of 1 mmMgATP. The CAX1 NRR was amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the EcoRI site of pACT2. Partial fragments of sCAX1, sCAX3, and sCAX3-9-7aa (residues 44–69) and a partial fragment of sCAX1 (residues 438–463) were amplified by PCR and cloned in-frame into the NcoI andBamHI sites of pAS2. Plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain Y190 and selected on synthetic complete (SC) agar medium lacking Leu, Trp, and His (23Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). Expression of constructs was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-hemagglutinin antibody (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Protein interaction was determined by assaying for LacZ expression using the β-galactoside filter assay (23Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5250) Google Scholar). To determine whether the CAX1 NRR functions as an autoinhibitory domain, a synthetic peptide was generated that corresponds to all 36 amino acids (CAX1-NRR peptide, MAGIVTEPWSVAENGNPSITAKGSSRELRLGRTAHNM, net charge +1). Ca2+/H+ antiport activity by sCAX1, which lacks the NRR, was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. A peptide concentration of 5 ± 1.5 μm was sufficient to inhibit 50% of sCAX1 transport activity with 10 μm Ca2+ (Fig.1, A and B). A control peptide (LKIKTEGNFEQANEELRAIIKKIWKRTSMKLLDQV, net charge +3) of similar size and charge to CAX1-NRR did not inhibit sCAX1-dependent transport at concentrations of as much as 20 μm (Fig. 1 A). The K m of sCAX1 for Ca2+ increased ∼3-fold in the presence of 6 μm peptide (Fig. 1 C). Inhibition of Ca2+/H+ antiport activity was specific to sCAX1, as the peptide was unable to inhibit Ca2+ transport by other antiporters sCAX2, VCX1, and sCAX3-9 (Fig. 1 A). We wanted to verify that the inhibitory effect of the CAX1-NRR peptide on CAX1-dependent Ca2+ transport was not an artifact of the yeast expression system. MgATP-dependent H-ATPase-driven Ca2+ transport, in the presence of the Ca-ATPase inhibitor vanadate, was determined in vacuolar-enriched membrane vesicles from wild-typeArabidopsis roots (Fig.2 A). Given that CAX1 expression is highly induced by exogenous Ca2+ (24Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), we isolated vacuolar-enriched membrane vesicles fromArabidopsis plants treated with 100 mmCa2+ for 18 h. Significant Ca2+/H+ antiport activity could be measured only from Ca2+-treated plants (Fig. 2 A). Ca2+/H+ antiport activity was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the CAX1-NRR peptide (Fig. 2 B). A peptide concentration of ∼9–10 μm was required for 50% inhibition of Ca2+transport. To deduce which residues were important for interaction of the NRR with sCAX1, the CAX1-NRR peptide was tested on sCAX1 chimeras that contain various domains of sCAX3 and sCAX2. These constructs were previously used to identify the CaD within the N terminus of sCAX1 that is critical for Ca2+ transport (19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). sCAX3-9 contains an in-frame fusion of the CAX1 CaD (residues 87–95), allowing sCAX3 to transport Ca2+ (19Shigaki T. Cheng N.-H. Pittman J.K. Hirschi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43152-43159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). As the CAX1-NRR peptide interacts with sCAX1, but not sCAX3-9 (Fig. 1 A), sCAX1/CAX3 chimeras were used to determine the amino acids that are required for binding the NRR peptide. A chimera (sCAX3-A) that contains the first quarter of sCAX1 (residues 37–149) fused in-frame to the CAX3 open reading frame was inhibited by the peptide (Fig.3 A). We then tested whether the NRR interacts with the CAX1 CaD. Ca2+ transport by sCAX3-9 and by sCAX2 containing the CAX1 CaD (sCAX2-9) was not inhibited by the NRR peptide (Fig. 3 A; data not shown), whereas transport by sCAX1 containing the equivalent CaD of CAX2 (sCAX1-9) was still inhibited. The effect of the peptide on Ca2+ transport by sCAX3-A2 and sCAX1-A1 was then tested. In these constructs, the first quarter domain (residues 37–149) was further divided in half and comprised the immediate N terminus of sCAX3 (residues 37–73); only the second half of this domain was CAX1 (residues 74–149). No inhibition of Ca2+ transport occurred for either of these constructs (Fig. 3 A). The amino acid sequences for CAX1 and CAX3 within the region of residues 37–73 were compared. Two regions of heterogeneity were identified within this sequence, a region of 2 amino acids and a region of 7 amino acids. Mutagenesis was performed on sCAX3-9 and sCAX1-A1 to change residues LV to VI (residues 50–51) or residues CKTLKNI to YKGLKDF (residues 56–62). Following mutagenesis, both constructs were able to transport Ca2+. The CAX1-NRR peptide was unable to inhibit Ca2+ transport by sCAX3-9 and sCAX1-A1 (Fig. 3 A). This peptide was able to inhibit Ca2+ transport by both constructs when they contained the 7-amino acid substitution (sCAX3-9-7aa and sCAX1-A1-7aa; Fig.3 A). However, no inhibition was found when they contained the 2-amino acid substitution. Furthermore, when mutagenesis was performed on CAX1 so that the 7-amino acid region was swapped with that of CAX3 (to give CAX1–7aa), CAX1–7aa was now able to suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of K667, although not as strongly as sCAX1 (Fig. 3 B). sCAX1 containing the 7-amino acid region of CAX3 (sCAX1–7aa) could suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype as strongly as sCAX1 (Fig.3 B). However, Ca2+ transport by sCAX1–7aa could not be inhibited by the CAX1-NRR peptide (Fig. 3 C). A physical interaction between the NRR and the 7-amino acid region of sCAX1 was tested using a yeast two-hybrid assay. When the CAX1 NRR in pACT2 was coexpressed with a hydrophilic N-terminal fragment of sCAX1 (residues 44–69 including the 7-amino acid region) in pAS2, thelacZ gene was activated, indicating that an interaction had occurred (Fig. 3 D). No interaction occurred with a similar N-terminal fragment of sCAX3 or a hydrophilic C-terminal fragment (residues 438–463) of CAX1. Similar results were obtained with other two-hybrid constructs; specifically, the NRR of CAX1 only interacted with constructs containing residues 44–69 of CAX1 (data not shown). No interaction was observed when CAX1 NRR was coexpressed with an N-terminal fragment of sCAX3 that included the 7-amino acid region of CAX1, although we did occasionally observe a weak interaction with some of the replicates (data not shown). We previously noted that the NRR of CAX1 contains putative phosphorylation sites (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To investigate whether any of the five residues Thr6, Ser10, Ser24, Ser25, and Thr33 may be phosphorylated, they were each mutated to Ala. This change was expected to block any phosphorylation event required to deactivate CAX1. All five CAX1 mutants were expressed at equal levels in yeast (data not shown), but only the T33A change strongly suppressed the K667 Ca2+-sensitive phenotype (Fig. 4 A). Thr33 was further mutated to Asp to mimic continuous phosphorylation to see whether activation could be blocked. The T33D change and all other mutations of this residue (T33S and T33E) allowed yeast growth on high Ca2+, indicating CAX1 activation (Fig.4 A). Because the S25A mutation had caused very weak suppression of Ca2+ sensitivity, we further mutated this residue. A S25T change gave no suppression (Fig.4 B; data not shown) whereas a S25D change caused strong suppression of the K667 phenotype (Fig. 4 A). The yeast growth was caused by Ca2+/H+ transport activity conferred by CAX1S25D as demonstrated by the45Ca2+ uptake into endomembrane-enriched vesicles from CAX1S25D expressing yeast (Fig.5). No Ca2+ uptake could be measured for CAX1 and CAX1S25A. When other Ser residues in the NRR were mutated to Asp (S10D or S24D) no suppression of the K667 phenotype was observed (Fig. 4 B; data not shown).Figure 5Ca2+/H+ antiport activity of mutant CAX1 in yeast endomembrane vesicles.

Results are the mean (±S.E.) of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The CAX1 NRR contains a number of charged residues, particularly Glu and Arg (Fig. 6). To investigate whether any of these residues have a role in the binding mechanism of the NRR, three sets of double substitutions were created to remove the charge of these residues: E7A/E13A, R26A/E27A, and R29A/R32A. Only the R29A/R32A mutation allowed CAX1 to strongly suppress the Ca2+-sensitive phenotype of K667, comparable to the suppression by sCAX1 (Fig. 6). The regulation of Ca2+ efflux mediated by high capacity Ca2+/H+ exchange activity (and by Ca2+ pumping directly energized by ATP hydrolysis) is likely to be an important component in Ca2+ signaling (2Harper J.F. Trends Plant Sci. 2001; 6: 395-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Vacuolar Ca2+/H+ antiporters can sequester a sudden burst of cytosolic Ca2+ more efficiently than the higher affinity Ca-ATPase (5Miseta A. Kellermayer R. Aielli D.P., Fu, L. Bedwell D.M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 132-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of Ca2+/H+ antiporters is poorly understood. For example, the yeast Ca2+/H+ antiporter VCX1 appears to be negatively regulated at the post-translational level by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin; however, the nature of this regulation remains unclear (12Cunningham K.W. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2226-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Furthermore, nothing is known about the regulation of theE. coli Ca2+/H+ antiporter chaA or the mung bean antiporter VCAX1 (10Ueoka-Nakanishi H. Nakanishi Y. Tanaka Y. Maeshima M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Zemsky J. Pinner E. Karpel R. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11296-11303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We recently described the presence of an NRR on Arabidopsis CAX1 (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that the NRR of CAX1 regulates Ca2+/H+ antiport activity by a unique autoinhibitory mechanism. A synthetic peptide composed of the 36 amino acids of the CAX1 NRR inhibited Ca2+ transport by the truncated sCAX1 at micromolar concentration, but did not inhibit transport by other Ca2+/H+ antiporters (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, a control peptide with similar charge and size properties did not inhibit Ca2+ transport by sCAX1 (Fig.1 A). The CAX1-NRR peptide also substantially increased theK m for Ca2+ of sCAX1 (Fig.1 C). The inhibition by the CAX1-NRR peptide was not caused by a reduction of the proton motive force across the membrane through a nonspecific interaction with lipids or proteins, because the peptide did not disrupt ΔpH-dependent Ca2+ transport by sCAX2, VCX1, or sCAX3-9 (Fig. 1 A). It could also be argued that the peptide was directly binding Ca2+, as this would also raise the apparent K m for Ca2+. However, we believe that this was not the case, because Ca2+ binding by the peptide would cause a reduction in free Ca2+ concentration that would reduce the level of Ca2+ transport by all antiporters, not just sCAX1. In addition, we observed a reduction in transport only for sCAX1. These results indicate that the 36-residue sequence does function like an inhibitory domain confirming that CAX1 is regulated by autoinhibition. We wished to verify that CAX1 is similarly regulated inArabidopsis and that our observations were not an artifact of the yeast expression system. In very few studies has Ca2+/H+ antiport activity been measured inArabidopsis tissue (25Gaxiola R.A., Li, J. Undurraga S. Dang L.M. Allen G.J. Alper S.L. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11444-11449Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). We were able to measure Ca2+/H+ antiport activity in vacuolar membranes from Arabidopsis roots (Fig. 2 A). These plants were pretreated with 100 mm Ca2+ that has been shown to strongly induce expression of CAX1 (24Hirschi K.D. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2113-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) but not CAX2 (18Hirschi K.D. Korenkov V.D. Wilganowski N.L. Wagner G.J. Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). This antiport activity was strongly inhibited by the CAX1-NRR peptide in a manner similar to the inhibition of sCAX1-dependent Ca2+ transport in yeast (Fig. 2 B). The ability of the peptide to inhibit the antiport activity suggests that under certain conditions (such as when high levels of exogenous Ca2+ are present) the majority of Ca2+/H+ antiport activity at the root vacuole is due to CAX1. We speculate that CAX1 only exists as a full-length version in planta; therefore, the antiport activity measured was mediated by an activated CAX1. Therefore, this result indicates that the CAX1-NRR peptide can inhibit full-length CAX1. We may hypothesize that an activator protein interacts with the NRR and prevents autoinhibition, allowing the NRR peptide to bind to CAX1 instead and inhibit activity. Alternatively, the peptide may compete directly for the activator protein, preventing the activator from interacting with CAX1, which remains autoinhibited. Identification of putative phosphorylation sites in the NRR led us to investigate whether CAX1 is regulated by a phosphorylation event. Our previous findings showed that minor deletions in the NRR can perturb inhibition (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar); however, changing Thr6, Ser10, or Ser24 to Ala residues did not disrupt N-terminal inhibition (Fig. 4). Mutagenesis of Thr33 to Ala strongly suppressed the Ca2+ sensitivity of K667 expressing CAX1, initially indicating that this residue may be phosphorylated to block CAX1 activation. However, any mutation of this residue caused yeast growth to occur, suggesting that this Thr has an important structural role in the autoinhibition rather than in being phosphorylated. The Ser25 to Ala change caused minimal growth; however, when Ser25 was mutated to Asp to mimic continuous phosphorylation, CAX1 was as active as sCAX1 (Figs. 4 and5). No suppression of the K667 phenotype was observed following mutation of Ser10 or Ser24 to Asp. This suggests that phosphorylation of CAX1 may activate Ca2+transport. Some of the positively charged Arg residues also appear to be involved in the autoinhibition mechanism. Substitution of these residues to Ala, thereby removing their charge, activated CAX1 (Fig.6). Binding of a regulatory protein to the CAX1 NRR may prevent autoinhibition and activate CAX1. Some of the Ser, Thr, and Arg residues highlighted by this work may be candidates for part of a binding site for regulatory proteins. The identification of activators for CAX1 will enable us to understand how it is regulated and how it might relate to a particular Ca2+ signal transduction pathway. The mechanism of CAX1 autoinhibition appears to involve a physical interaction between two discreet domains, the NRR and residues C-terminal to this region (Fig. 7). In order to show this interaction we used two different approaches. Initially, a series of chimeric CAX constructs were used to discriminate the region of CAX1 that interacts with the CAX1 NRR. Peptide inhibition studies showed that the NRR peptide could inhibit any sCAX construct containing the N-terminal 7 amino acids from sCAX1. When N-terminal chimeras using other CAX transporters were analyzed, no peptide inhibition was seen. However, when 7 amino acids from CAX1 (residues 56–62) were inserted into sCAX3-9 at the N terminus, the CAX1 peptide could inhibit sCAX3-9 mediated Ca2+/H+ transport. Furthermore, when the equivalent 7-amino acid region of CAX3 was swapped into sCAX1, peptide inhibition of Ca2+/H+ transport was abolished. That this construct could still transport Ca2+ confirms that this region is not required for transport. CAX1 containing the CAX3 7-amino acid region (CAX1–7aa) was no longer autoinhibited, and this construct was able to suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the K667 yeast mutant. This chimeric CAX/CAX1-NRR approach was informative but rather unconventional. We also used yeast two-hybrid analysis to confirm an interaction between the CAX1 NRR and the CAX1 7-amino acid region by using a hydrophilic construct (residues 44–69) of sCAX1 (Fig. 3 D). Similar results showed an interaction with the N terminus of sCAX1 (residues 37–222) using a fragment that contained some hydrophobic regions (data not shown). Surprisingly, no strong interaction was observed for CAX1 NRR with the construct containing the CAX1 7-amino acid region swapped into CAX3. This may be because of inappropriate folding of this protein. We term this 7-amino acid region the regulatory-dependent region. Our findings establish that these 7 amino acids are required for autoinhibition, although this analysis does not conclude that these are the only amino acids that interact with the N-terminal 36 amino acids. Given that CAX3 and CAX1 are very similar and many of the amino acids in their N termini are identical (Fig. 7 A), other residues may be involved in this interaction. Further work is required to determine which residues in the NRR are required for interaction with its binding site. Residues Ser25, Arg29, Arg32, and Thr33 appear to be important, indicating that the C-terminal end of the NRR could contain the autoinhibitory binding site (Fig. 7). However, we have previously shown that removal of the first ten residues of the NRR prevents inhibition (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), indicating that the structure of the entire NRR may be important for inhibition. Like CAX1, some plant Ca-ATPases with truncations at the N terminus are able to suppress yeast mutants that are defective in endomembrane Ca2+ transport; however, the N-terminal autoinhibitory mechanisms of plant Ca-ATPases appear to drastically differ from that proposed for CAX1. Arabidopsis Ca-ATPases ACA2, ACA4, andBrassica BCA1 are regulated by calmodulin binding or phosphorylation of an N-terminal autoinhibitory domain (26Malmström S. Åkerlund H.-E. Askerlund P. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 27Hwang I. Sze H. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A calmodulin-binding sequence is present within the N-terminal domain of ACA2, and the full-length pump demonstrates calmodulin-stimulated Ca2+ transport in yeast (29Harper J.F. Hong B. Hwang I. Guo H.Q. Stoddard R. Huang J.F. Palmgren M.G. Sze H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1099-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 30Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). CAX1, however, is not activated by calmodulin (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A Ca2+-dependent protein kinase-binding site is present in the N terminus of ACA2 that phosphorylates a Ser near the calmodulin-binding site. This kinase activity inhibits ACA2 activity (27Hwang I. Sze H. Harper J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6224-6229Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that CAX1 may be activated rather than repressed by phosphorylation (Fig.4). Autoinhibitory domain peptides of Ca-ATPases have been shown to inhibit truncated and full-length calmodulin-activated pumps (30Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 31Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Gardos G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degree of inhibition in these studies is similar to what we have observed for CAX1 (Fig. 1). A peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of ACA2 inhibited 50% of activity (IC50) of truncated ACA2 at 4 μm and increased the pump's K m for Ca2+ by 2-fold (30Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Similarly, a peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of rabbit PMCA2b had an IC50 of 1 μm(31Enyedi A. Filoteo A.G. Gardos G. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8952-8956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CAX1-NRR peptide only inhibited CAX1 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, peptides derived from some mammalian and plant Ca-ATPases were not as specific (30Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 32Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies, a Ca-ATPase autoinhibitory domain peptide could inhibit different Ca2+transporters, including the Ca2+/Na+ exchanger (32Enyedi A. Penniston J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17120-17125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, a peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of ACA2 could inhibit activity of another ArabidopsisCa-ATPase ECA1 (30Hwang I. Harper J.F. Liang F. Sze H. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Now that we have identified domains important for CAX1 autoinhibition, future work must assess possible conformational changes associated with autoinhibition. In animal Ca-ATPases, the autoinhibitory domain affects activity by causing self-association of the transporter (6Penniston J.T. Enyedi A. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 165: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In some plant Ca-ATPases, the autoinhibitory domain binds to a stalk region and hydrophilic loops near the N terminus (7Sze H. Liang F. Hwang I. Curran A.C. Harper J.F. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 51: 433-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Regardless of the specifics of inhibition, activation of the Ca-ATPases in plants and animals requires the sensing of Ca2+ fluxes that then activate calmodulin. Our previous identification of a longer open reading frame of CAX1 suggested that the original N-terminal-truncated sCAX1 is most likely encoded by a partial-length cDNA. Thus, we concluded that only a truncated and deregulated version of CAX1 could suppress the Ca2+ sensitivity of the yeast mutant K667 (8Pittman J.K. Hirschi K.D. Plant Physiol. 2001; 127: 1020-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown how mutagenesis of single amino acids can be used to determine some of the mechanisms of autoinhibition. We have shown how to create a deregulated and activated Ca2+/H+ antiporter. We have also shown how a peptide corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain can specifically inhibit the activity of deregulated CAX1 both in yeast and inArabidopsis. This is the first report of peptide inhibition of Ca2+/H+ antiport activity. These findings suggest that it may be possible to temporally and spatially engineer expression of CAX1 NRR peptides in plants as a means to modulate CAX1-mediated Ca2+ transport.

In this study, we established rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cell lines that stably express Syts III-, V-, VI-, and X-GFP (green fluorescence protein) fusion proteins, respectively, to determine their precise subcellular localizations. Surprisingly, Syts III-, V-, VI-, and X-GFP proteins were found to be targeted to specific organelles: Syt III-GFP to near the plasma membrane, Syt V-GFP to dense-core vesicles, Syt VI-GFP to endoplasmic reticulum-like structures, and Syt X-GFP to vesicles (other than dense-core vesicles) present in cytoplasm. We showed that Syt V-containing vesicles at the neurites of PC12 cells were processed to exocytosis in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Immunohistochemical analysis further showed that endogenous Syt V was also localized on dense-core vesicles in the mouse brain and specifically expressed in glucagon-positive α-cells in mouse pancreatic islets, but not in β- or δ-cells. Based on these results, we propose that Syt V is a dense-core vesicle-specific Syt isoform that controls a specific type of Ca2+-regulated secretion.

Synaptic vesicle exocytosis, one of the well characterized forms of regulated vesicle trafficking, is strictly regulated by a rapid increase in Ca2+ ions (10–200 μm) entering through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (1Llinás R.

Syt constitutes a large family in both vertebrates and invertebrates, and at least 13 members have been described in the rat, mouse, and human (8, 11–13 and references therein).

Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and an N-terminal Cys cluster responsible for dimer formation via disulfide bonding (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 19Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 637-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, the exact functions and subcellular localization of these Syts are still a matter of controversy. For instance, Südhof and co-workers (8Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7629-7632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) recently proposed that Syts III and VI function as plasma membrane Ca2+ sensors, whereas others have shown that Syt III is localized on insulin-containing vesicles (34Mizuta M. Kurose T. Miki T. Shoji-Kasai Y. Takahashi M. Seino S. Matsukura S. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Gao Z. Reavey-Cantwell J. Young R.A. Jegier P. Wolf B.A. J. Biol.

Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18290-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is quite important to determine the exact localization of Syts to understand the functional diversity or functional redundancy of these Syt isoforms (III, V, VI, and X). In this study, we investigated the subcellular distributions of the subclass of Syt (III, V, VI, and X), focusing especially on Syt V, which has never been characterized. Two different methods (stable expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged Syt in PC12 cells and subcellular fractionation of brain) demonstrated that Syt V is localized predominantly on dense-core vesicles but that others are not enriched in these vesicles. In addition, Syt V was found to be specifically expressed in pancreatic α-cells. Based on our findings, we propose that Syt V is a cell type-specific regulator for Ca2+-dependent dense-core vesicle exocytosis. The cDNA fragments encoding Syts III, V, VI, and X were prepared as described previously (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 14Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Construction of the expression vector encoding FLAG-Syt-GFP (named pShooter-FLAG-Syt-GFP) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was essentially carried out by PCR as described elsewhere (see Fig.1 A) (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 37Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Briefly, the 3′-end of each Syt cDNA was ligated to the 5′-end of GFP cDNA to encode a fusion protein of Syt-GFP, and the sequences encoding the FLAG tag were inserted into the 5′-end of each Syt cDNA. A glycine linker was inserted between Syt and GFP to minimize interactions affecting the proper folding of the C2B domain (38Fukuda M. Yamamoto A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41112-41119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments encoding these fusion proteins were subcloned into the NotI site of the modified pShooter vector (37Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and verified by DNA sequencing as described previously (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PC12 cells (2 × 106 cells, the day before transfection) were cultured on 10-cm dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% horse serum and 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C under 5% CO2. The expression vectors encoding the Syt-GFP fusion protein were transfected into PC12 cells with LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells expressing neomycin-resistant gene were selected using Geneticin (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 400 μg/ml. Production of Syt-GFP fusion protein in each established cell line was verified by both immunoblot and immunocytochemical analyses. The cloned PC12 cells (5 × 104 cells/35-mm dish) stably expressing each Syt-GFP fusion protein were cultured with or without 100 ng/ml β-nerve growth factor (NGF) (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) for 3 days. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature, and the fixation was stopped with 0.1 m glycine. The cells were then permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were reacted with primary antibody (Ab), anti-Syt I (SYA-148, 1/250 dilution; StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, BC, Canada), for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1/5,000 dilution, Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactivity was analyzed with a confocal microscope (Fluoview, OLYMPUS, Tokyo, Japan) and Adobe Photoshop software (version 5.0). Anti-Syt III-C rabbit Ab was produced against the synthetic peptide corresponding to the C terminus of Syt III with an artificial Cys residue (CFTKGGKGLSEKENSE), as described previously (39Kida Y. Sakaguchi M. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Mihara K. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 719-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Anti-Syt V-C2A and anti-Syt VΔC2AB Abs were raised against the C2A domain (amino acids 217–343) (17Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the cytoplasmic region between the transmembrane and the C2 domain (amino acids 71–216), respectively. Both antigens were produced as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) (40Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Syt VI-C2A antibody was prepared as described previously (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Anti-Syt X-C2A antibody was raised against the C2A domain of Syt X as the fusion protein with GST (17Ibata K. Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12267-12273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The procedure for immunization and purification of IgG has been described previously (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The specificity of the Abs was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with recombinant T7-tagged Syts I–XIII expressed in COS-7 cells as the loading samples (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Except for anti-Syt V-C2A Ab, all of the Abs specifically recognized each antigen and did not cross-react with other Syt isoforms under our experimental conditions (data not shown). Three independent stable cell lines for each Syt-GFP construct were homogenized in 1% SDS with a 27-gauge syringe. After addition of SDS sample buffer, they were resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were incubated with blocking buffer containing 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG M2 antibody (100 ng/ml, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) for 1 h at room temperature. The specific Abs described above (anti-Syt III-C rabbit antiserum (1/125 dilution), anti-Syt VΔC2AB rabbit Ab, anti-Syt VI-C2A rabbit Ab, anti-Syt X-C2A rabbit Ab (2 μg/ml)) were used to detect the endogenous expression of Syts III, V, VI, and X (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar,41Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because the anti-Syt VI-C2A rabbit Ab weakly recognizes Syt I, the cross-reactive component was removed by preincubation with GST-Syt I-C2A recombinant proteins (24Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31428-31434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The signals were detected by means of enhanced chemiluminescence systems (Amersham Biosciences). The PC12 stable cell lines (5 × 106 cells in a 10-cm dish) were cultured with NGF for 3 days. Cells from two confluent plates were harvested and homogenized in 1 ml of 0.3 m sucrose, 5 mmEDTA, and 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 1,000 rpm. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove debris, and the supernatant was loaded on a linear sucrose gradient (0.6–1.8 m) and spun at 100,000 ×g for 6 h in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). 14 fractions of 0.75 ml each were collected from the top of the gradient and analyzed by immunoblotting. The following Abs were used as organelle markers: anti-secretogranin II (1 μg/ml, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and anti-synaptophysin (1 μg/ml, Sigma). SYA-148 (shown above) or unpurified anti-Syt IX rabbit Ab, which can also react with Syt I (41Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was used to detect Syt I. Subcellular fractionation of adult mouse whole brain was performed in a similar manner. To investigate whether the vesicles containing Syt V-GFP fusion protein are involved in Ca2+-regulated exocytosis, anti-FLAG M2 antibody uptake experiments were performed as described previously (13Fukuda M. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2001; 354: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,41Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Briefly, PC12 stable cells cultured for 3 days in the presence of NGF were washed with low KCl buffer (5.6 mm KCl, 145 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4) twice and then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody at a concentration of 1.1 μg/ml in either low or high KCl buffer for 15 min at 37 °C. High KCl buffer consists of 56 mm KCl, 95 mm NaCl, 2.2 mmCaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.5 mmMgCl2, and 15 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4. They were then washed twice with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, treated with 0.1 m glycine, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min at room temperature. After washing and incubating with blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, incorporated anti-FLAG M2 antibody was visualized by reacting with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a concentration of 1/5,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, they were washed with blocking buffer and processed for confocal microscopy as described above. Whole brain or pancreas from an adult ICR female mouse was homogenized in 4 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μmpepstatin A, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the homogenate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was incubated with either 1 μg/ml anti-Syt V-C2A Ab or normal rabbit IgG as a control for 1 h at 4 °C and then with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times with the homogenizing buffer, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Syt VΔC2AB Ab. An ICR adult mouse was perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and the pancreas was excised and postfixed in the same fixative. It was cryosectioned into 10-μm thick sections, dried, rehydrated in PBS, and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization in methanol for 30 min at −20 °C, the sections were incubated in 2% skim milk, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1% donkey serum in PBS for 1 h at room temperature and then with the following primary Abs: 5 μg/ml anti-Syt VΔC2AB Ab (described above), 10 μg/ml anti-glucagon goat Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-insulin guinea pig Ab (1/1 dilution; Zymed Laboratories, Inc.), or 2 μg/ml anti-somatostatin goat Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Positive immunoreactivity was visualized with the following secondary Abs: Alexa 488-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, Alexa 594-conjugated anti-goat IgG, or Alexa 568-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG (1/1,000 dilution, Molecular Probes). To investigate the subcellular localization of the subclass of Syts (Syts III, V, VI, and X) (12Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

Neurochem. 1999; 72: 1821-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), we selected PC12 cells for our initial study. Although the Syt family lacks a signal peptide sequence and should contain a specific membrane targeting signal itself (49Fukuda M. Ibata K. Mikoshiba K. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 730-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), transient overexpression of some Syt-GFP proteins (especially Syt V) in PC12 cells was found to induce abnormal membranous structures (aggregation of GFP fluorescence) or abnormal cell shapes (data not shown). These effects are unlikely to be attributable to an artifact induced by fusion of GFP because transient overexpression of FLAG-Syt alone produced the same effects (data not shown). To eliminate the artifacts induced by forced overexpression, PC12 cell lines stably expressing each Syt-GFP or GFP alone, as a control, were established (Fig. 1, B and C, and Fig. 2). At least three independent cell lines for each construct were cloned, and the expression of FLAG-Syt-GFP fusion proteins was confirmed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG M2 Ab (Fig. 1 B). The molecular weight of the fusion proteins was almost identical to their calculated molecular weight, and their amount was almost the same in all three lines but much lower than expression of GFP alone. Expression of FLAG-Syt-GFP in stable cells was further confirmed by specific Abs against each isoform (Fig. 1 C, right lanes). Consistent with the previous report (41Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4601-4604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), however, we could not detect any endogenous Syt signals in control PC12 cells stably expressing FLAG-GFP (Fig.1 C, left lanes), indicating that the endogenous levels of expression of Syt III, V, VI, or X in normal PC12 cells are very low, if they are expressed at all. We then attempted to determine the organelles to which the Syt-GFP fusion proteins are targeted by confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). The stable cell lines were also immunostained with anti-Syt I Ab, a marker for dense-core vesicles and synaptic-like microvesicles in PC12 cells (41Fukuda M. Kowalchyk J.A. Zhang X. Martin T.F.J.

https://openalex.org/W2013074682,"Human stromelysin 3 (ST3) is a matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) that has been implicated in cancer progression and in various tissue remodeling processes. Unlike most MMPs, ST3 is characterized by a distinct substrate specificity and a specific regulation and is not directly involved in extracellular matrix degradation. In the present study, we have identified an additional ST3 gene promoter that is accessible to nuclear factors such as C/EBP and retinoic acid receptors. This human specific promoter is inducible and controls the expression of a novel ST3 transcript called the β-ST3 that is expressed in cultured cells and in placenta. This transcript encodes a 40-kDa ST3 isoform that lacks both the signal peptide common to all secreted MMPs and the prodomain that normally maintains enzyme latency. Consistent with the lack of a signal peptide, the β-ST3 was found to be intracellular. The relative amount of the extracellular α-ST3 isoform was about 20-fold higher than that of the intracellular ST3 isoforms, as estimated by Western blot analysis. Furthermore, recombinant β-ST3 produced in Escherichia coli exhibits a proteolytic activity against α1-proteinase inhibitor, a substrate previously shown to be inactivated by the α-ST3. Therefore, although it was thought that all MMPs were synthesized as inactive zymogens and functioned extracellularly, this is the first MMP isoform reported that is generated by alternative promoter usage and directly translated as an active enzyme. Although the intracellular function of the β-ST3 remains to be investigated, these data support the idea that the functions of MMPs are not restricted to the extracellular space.

The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)1 belong to a well conserved family of matrix-degrading endopeptidases that are implicated in physiological processes associated with tissue remodeling (1Sternlicht M.D. Werb Z. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 463-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (3226) Google Scholar). They are divided in four major subgroups in which most members are organized into three basic and well conserved domains, the propeptide, the catalytic domain, and the hemopexin-like domain (2Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Their catalytic activity is regulated at the levels of transcription, secretion, activation, and inhibition. All MMPs are produced in a latent inactive form, and their activation requires removal of the propeptide. Whereas this activation occurs for most after their secretion, ST3 and membrane-type MMPs have a specific furin recognition site at the end of their propeptide that mediates their activation within the cell (3Pei D. Weiss S.J. Nature. 1995; 375: 244-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 4Nagase H. Woessner J.F., Jr. J. Biol.

Although related by sequence to MMPs, at a functional level the human ST3, in contrast to the mouse ST3, does not degrade components of the extracellular matrix (5Noël A. Santavicca M. Stoll I.

The former substrate suggests that ST3, by controlling the availability of insulin-like growth factor, plays a role in processes such as cell proliferation and/or differentiation. The degradation of serpins suggests an indirect role for ST3 in extracellular matrix turnover through the degradation of the inhibitors of this process. ST3 was initially identified in the stromal compartment of breast carcinomas (8Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). Furthermore, ST3 has been shown to be one of the rare MMPs for which a significant correlation has been demonstrated between its expression in tumors and a poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (9Ahmad A. Hanby A. Dublin E. Poulsom R. Smith P. Barnes D. Rubens R. Anglard P. Hart I. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 721-728PubMed Google Scholar, 10Duffy M.J. Maguire T.M. Hill A. McDermott E. O'Higgins N. Breast Cancer Res. 2000; 2: 252-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Its expression is also associated with the invasion and aggressiveness of most types of human carcinomas (11Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Lefebvre O. Noël A. Chenard M.P. Wolf C. Anglard P. Rio M.C. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1997; 26: 43-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Accordingly, ST3 promotes malignant cell implantation in mice and tumor development (12Masson R. Lefebvre O. Noël A. Fahime M.E. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Kebers F., Le Meur M. Dierich A. Foidart J.M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1535-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 13Boulay A. Masson R. Chenard M.P., El Fahime M. Cassard L. Bellocq J.P. Sautes-Fridman C. Basset P. Rio M.C. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2189-2193PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, a number of clinic and experimental investigations suggested that ST3, as other MMPs (14Zucker S. Cao J. Chen W.T. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6642-6650Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 15Coussens L.M. Fingleton B. Matrisian L.M.

Cancer. 2002; 2: 161-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (5112) Google Scholar), may represent an attractive target for therapeutic approaches directed against the stromal compartment of human carcinomas, and to this end, specific inhibitors of ST3 have been designed (17Vassiliou S. Mucha A. Cuniasse P. Georgiadis D. Lucet-Levannier K. Beau F. Kannan R. Murphy G. Knauper V. Rio M.C. Basset P. Yiotakis A. Dive V. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Like other MMPs, ST3 is expressed during wound healing (18Okada A. Tomasetto C. Lutz Y. Bellocq J.P. Rio M.C. Basset P. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 67-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), mammary gland involution (19Lefebvre O. Wolf C. Limacher J.M. Hutin P. Wendling C., Le Meur M. Basset P. Rio M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 997-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), cycling endometrium (20Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Cannon P. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and development (21Lefebvre O. Régnier C. Chenard M.P. Wendling C. Chambon P. Basset P. Rio M.C. Development. 1995; 121: 947-955Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, although in vivo studies have emphasized the contribution of this enzyme in functions such as cell migration, apoptosis, or in tumor progression, the mechanisms and the factors controlling its cell-specific expression remain poorly understood. At the cellular level, tumor-stroma co-culture assays have provided evidence that the expression of ST3 in fibroblasts requires direct contact between fibroblasts and cancer cells (22Mari B.P. Anderson I.C. Mari S.E. Ning YY. Lutz Y. Kobzik L. Shipp M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 618-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In contrast to this, the induction of other MMPs such as MMP-1 in fibroblasts is mediated by a soluble factor produced by cancer cells (23Westermarck J., Li, S. Jaakkola P. Kallunki T. Grenman R. Kahari V.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 60: 7156-7162Google Scholar). At the molecular level, ST3 is induced by basic fibroblast growth factor (8Basset P. Bellocq J.P. Wolf C. Stoll I. Hutin P. Limacher J.M. Podhajcer O.L. Chenard M.P. Rio M.C. Chambon P. Nature. 1990; 348: 699-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), thyroid hormone (24Puzianowska-Kuznicka M. Damjanovski S. Shi Y.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4738-4749Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and phorbol esters (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), whereas it is repressed by progesterone (20Rodgers W.H. Matrisian L.M. Giudice L.C. Dsupin B. Cannon P. Svitek C. Gorstein F. Osteen K.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 946-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In addition, although the expression of MMPs is usually repressed by retinoic acid (RA) (26Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. Gene Expr. 1996; 6: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar), the expression of ST3 has been shown to be induced by RA through a retinoic acid-responsive element present in its proximal promoter and interacting with retinoic acid receptor/retinoid X receptor heterodimers (27Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations indicate that ST3 shares to some extent a similar expression pattern with other MMPs but also differs strongly from most of them in its activation process, its catalytic activity, and its specific regulation. In the present study, we have looked for additional regulatory sequences that could control the cell-specific expression of ST3 by mapping chromatin-accessible regions. This approach has allowed us to identify an additional ST3 isoform that differs from all MMPs described thus far. Indeed, this isoform is directly translated into an active form and is not secreted. Our findings provide new insights into the regulation of ST3 and highlight hitherto unknown intracellular MMP functions. The rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (RD) and the SL-6 NSCLC cell line were maintained in monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% calf serum and RPMI 10% fetal calf serum as previously described (22Mari B.P.

HeLa cells and COS-1 cells were cultured in the same medium in the presence of 10 and 5% fetal calf serum, respectively. In selected experiments, cells were exposed to 20 ng/ml TPA (Sigma), 1 μm9-cis-retinoic acid (provided by P. F. Sorter, Hoffmann-La Roche), or to the MMP inhibitors BB94 (British Biotech, Oxford, UK) (28Taraboletti G. Garofalo A. Belotti D. Drudis T. Borsotti P. Scanziani E. Brown P.D. Giavazzi R. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1995; 87: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) and RXPO3 (Commissariat à l'Energie Atomique, Saclay, France) (17Vassiliou S. Mucha A. Cuniasse P. Georgiadis D. Lucet-Levannier K. Beau F. Kannan R. Murphy G. Knauper V. Rio M.C. Basset P. Yiotakis A. Dive V. J. Med. Chem. 1999; 42: 2610-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Nuclei preparation and DNase I hypersensitive site mapping were performed as described previously (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of purified nuclei were resuspended at a concentration of 0.5 μg of DNA/μl and digested with 3, 6, or 12 units of DNase I (grade I, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). DNA was extracted, and 20 μg was digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes. Southern blot analysis was performed using genomic probes generated near the end of the restriction fragments of interest. Two overlapping DNA fragments of 635 and 452 bp and extending, respectively, from nucleotides −782 to −148 and from nucleotides −247 to +205 relative to the second transcription start site (+2) were generated by PCR. After subcloning, the resulting fragments were isolated in order to label their coding and non-coding strands with the Klenow enzyme. Purified probes were incubated with nuclear extracts, and binding was performed before analyzing the DNA on a denaturating sequencing gel, as previously described (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). RNA extraction and hybridization to the ZIV ST3 cDNA probe were previously described (27Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). RT-PCR was performed by using the Promega Access RT-PCR System (Promega Corp.) with the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and the Tfl DNA polymerase. The two primers, 5′-GGCTTCCTGACCACAGCCTCACCTTTG-3′ (XU112) and 5′-GCGCAGTCTAGAGCCCTGCCTGCCAGGATG-3′ (XU113, with restriction site underlined), designed from the 5′ exon of the β-ST3 transcript, were used with several 3′-primers complementary to sequences in exon 3 (5′-TGGCGTCACATCGCTCCATACCTTTAG-3′, XY79), exon 4 (5′-CTGGTCATCCCCGATAGTCCAGGTCTCATC-3′, XV153), exon 5 (5′-CTCAGTGGGTAGCGAAAGGTGTAGAAG-3′, XY78) and in the 3′-untranslated region of exon 8 (5′-CGGGCATCTAGACCATGGTCAGAGGAAAGTG-3′, YA161; 5′-CGGGGTACCTGGCCATGGGTCTCTAGCCTGATATTC-3′, XV226; 5′-GGTCCCAAGACTGCCCTTCCTCTTAAG-3′, XV225); exons are numbered according to the structure of the ST3 gene originally reported (29Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The α-ST3 transcript was also analyzed by using some of these 3′-primers with a 5′-primer (5′-CGATGCTGCTGCTGCTGCTCCAG-3′, YA160) designed from the sequence of the first exon (1α) of the α-ST3 cDNA. The [γ-32P]dATP-end-labeled antisense primer YA45 (5′-TCTCGGCATGGAGGTGGTGGACGTC-3′), designed from the sequence of the second exon, common to both α- and β-ST3 transcripts, was annealed to 2 μg of RNA extracted from COS-1 cells or COS-1 cells transfected with the β-ST3 cDNA under the control of its own promoter (P2-β-ST3 construct). The same primer was annealed to 10 μg of RNA extracted from RA-treated RD cells or human placenta. Reverse transcription was performed, and the resulting extended products were analyzed on a sequencing gel, as previously described (29Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Dideoxy sequencing reactions were performed with the same primer by using the P2-β-ST3 construct as a DNA template, allowing direct reading of the 5′-end sequence of the β-ST3 transcript. Conditioned media were collected from cells cultured in serum-free conditions and analyzed as previously described (5Noël A. Santavicca M. Stoll I. L'Hoir C. Staub A. Murphy G. Rio M.C. Basset P. J.

Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) including pepstatin, antipain, aprotinin, leupeptin, and chymostatin at 2.5 mg/ml each) and sonicated. The cell lysates from transfected COS-1 cells (0.2 μg), SL-6 cells (200 μg), and RD cells (100 μg) were separated on 10–12.5% SDS-PAGE gels under reducing conditions and analyzed by Western blot with the monoclonal antibodies 5ST4A9 (30Santavicca M. Noël A. Chenard M.P. Lutz Y. Stoll I. Segain J.P. Rouyer N. Rio M.C. Wolf C. Bellocq J.P. Basset P. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 64: 336-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and 1G4 (31Wu E. Mari B.P. Wang F. Anderson I.C. Sunday M.E. Shipp M.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 549-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Luciferase constructs containing various lengths of the second ST3 promoter (P2) were generated by PCR amplification from a 5.5-kbXhoI/NotI genomic template (29Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Primers were designed to generate PCR products with KpnI at their 5′-end and XhoI at their 3′-end, allowing their insertion into the firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3-Basic, Promega). The various constructs with their 5′- and 3′-ends defined by their position relative to the transcription start site are the following: 1-ST3-luc (−726 to +278), 0.5-ST3-luc (−459 to +8), 0.3-ST3-luc (−325 to +8), 0.06-ST3-luc (−59 to +8), and 0.9-ST3-luc (−782 to −148). RD cells were transiently transfected in 6-well plates by the calcium phosphate procedure, as previously described (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) using 2.5 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids and 0.25 μg of pCH110 plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Transfections were performed in triplicate and repeated three or four times. Results were normalized for protein content (light units/μg of protein). The P2-β-ST3 construct including the β-ST3 cDNA under the control of its own promoter (P2) was generated from two overlapping PCR products (see Fig. 4 A). The first PCR product (−59 to +141) includes a genomic sequence from the second promoter (P2) to the most 5′ exon (called exon −1β) and was amplified by using the 1-ST3-luc construct as genomic template with 5′-CGGGGTACCGTGTAGGTTGTTAAAAATTACTGCTGTCTTACTTC-3′ (with the restriction site underlined) as 5′-primer (XS249) and 5′-GCAGAGCCACGATCCAGGCAGTG-3′ as a 3′-primer. The second PCR product (β-ST3-cDNA) includes a cDNA sequence from the same exon −1β to the 3′-untranslated region (exon 8) and was generated by RT-PCR by using RNA extracted from RD cells exposed to RA with 5′-GGCTTCCTGACCACAGCCTCACCTTTG-3′ as a 5′-primer and 5′-GGTCCCAAGACTGCCCTTCCTCTTAAG-3′ as a 3′-primer. Both DNA fragments were annealed by denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by renaturation at 68 °C for 2 min, and the resulting heteroduplexes were extended with DNA polymerase I. PCR was carried out by using the 5′-primer XS249 containing a KpnI restriction site and a 3′-primer, 5′-CGGGCATCTAGACCATGGTCAGAGGAAAGTG-3′, containing a XbaI site, and the PCR product was cloned into the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) restricted by XbaI andKpnI, thereby replacing the luciferase cDNA. The cDNA encoding the α-ST3 proenzyme (PE) or the mature enzyme (E) including the catalytic and the hemopexin domains (residues Phe-98 to Leu-488) were cloned into the pSG5 vector for expression in COS-1 cells or in pET-3b for expression in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)pLysS, as previously described (5Noël A.

The cDNA fragment encoding the β-ST3 isoform (residues Met-130 to Leu-488) was generated by PCR using the α-ST3 precursor form (PE) cDNA as template with 2 sets of primers. The 5′-primers 5′-GAGAGAATTC ATGGCAGAGGCCCTAAAG-3′ and the 3′-primer 5′-GAGAGAATTCCTATCAGAGGAAAGTGTTGGC-3′ were used to clone into the EcoRI restriction site of pSG5, whereas the 5′-primer 5′-GCGGCAGACCATGGCAGAGGCCCTAAAGGTATG and the 3′-primer 5′-CGGGCATCTAGACCATGG TCAGAGGAAAGTG-3′ were used to clone into the NcoI restriction site of the pET-15b vector (Novagen). This pET-15b-β-ST3 was modified by site-directed mutagenesis to substitute the Glu at position 87 in the β-ST3 (position 216 in the α-ST3) by Ala using the QuikChangeTM mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the two primers 5′-CAGGTGGCAGCCCATGCATTTGGCCACGTGCTG-3′ and 5′-CAGCACGTGGCCAAATGCATGGGCTGCCACCTG-3′. The E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was then transformed with pET-15b-β-ST3 and pET-15b-β-ST3m87, and recombinant proteins were purified and analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, as previously reported (5Noël A.

The activities of α-ST3 (E), β-ST3, and β-ST3m87 were quantified using an indirect test based on their ability to inactivate α-antitrypsin (or α1-proteinase inhibitor), an inhibitor of α-chymotrypsin. The activity of α-chymotrypsin (1 μg) against a synthetic peptide substrate was evaluated in the presence of 1 μg of α1-proteinase inhibitor incubated with or without purified recombinant ST3 isoforms (1 μg), as previously described (32Kannan R.

The cleavage of the colorless substrate yields to a yellow product whose optical density is quantified using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Important regulatory sequences, such as promoter, enhancer, or cell-specific genomic regions are nucleosome-free regions and, as such, are more accessible to a variety of transcription factors. These sequences are usually associated with the presence of DNase I-hypersensitive sites (DHS) (34Cairns B.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To identify novel regulatory sequences, we have mapped DHSs present in a 5.3-kbSacI genomic fragment that can be divided in two regions of 3.7 and 1.6 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start site, respectively (Fig. 1 A). We prepared nuclei from control RD cells or from RD cells induced to express high levels of ST3 (27Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11088-11095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and these nuclei were exposed to increasing concentrations of DNase I. After DNA extraction and digestion with SacI, Southern blot analysis was performed using a genomic probe generated at the 5′-end of the 5.3-kbSacI restriction fragment. Four DHSs, including two constitutive DHSs, DHS1 and -3, and two inducible DHSs, DHS2 and -4, were identified within this 5.3-kb SacI fragment, and their position relative to the transcription start site is indicated in Fig.1 A. The position of the two proximal DHS1 and DHS2 is associated with the proximal ST3 promoter and a thyroid-responsive element (Fig. 1 B) (29Anglard P. Melot T. Guérin E. Thomas G. Basset P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20337-20344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), respectively. In addition, the distal-inducible DHS4 further supports our previous finding in which we demonstrated that this site is associated with a C/EBP-binding site (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). An additional DHS3 was identified and was mapped to about 1.8 kb upstream of the transcription start site. The region including this DHS did not reveal any known consensus regulatory sequences. To precisely define the position of transcription factor binding sites associated with this DHS3, we performed footprinting experiments on two overlapping genomic fragments of 635 bp (from −2502 to −1868) and 452 bp (from −1967 to −1516). Three different sequences were identified by using the first probe (Fig.2 A). The first protected region, including a C/EBP element between bases −2169 and −2151, was observed only with nuclear extracts from TPA-differentiated cells (lanes 7–9) and has been previously shown to mediate ST3 activation by TPA (25Luo D. Guérin E. Ludwig M.G. Stoll I. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37177-37185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The second protected region between bases −2032 and −2014 was a RARE of the DR2 type (lanes 4–9) that has been shown to be functional in the mouse ST3 gene promoter (35Ludwig M.G. Basset P. Anglard P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39981-39990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The last sequence including a TATAAA sequence at position −1972 suggested the presence of an additional promoter. However, this apparent TA-rich-associated footprint was observed in the absence of nuclear extract (lanes 1–3) and was not associated with any promoter activity (see Fig. 5). When the second probe including DHS3 was used (Fig. 2 B), a sequence between bases −1751 and −1713 was specifically protected in the presence of extract from RD cells expressing ST3 (lanes 7–9) but not with extracts from HeLa cells that do not express ST3. Although this protected region does not contain consensus sequences for any known DNA-binding protein, a strong 5′-splice site sequence (exon-AGGTG/GTGA-intron) was identified about 170 bp downstream, suggesting the presence of an additional exon. The position of each sequence, revealed by footprint analysis relative to that of the DHS, is illustrated in Fig.1 B.Figure 5Characterization of a second ST3 gene promoter. RD cells were transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids as indicated and further incubated for 48 h in the absence or the presence of 20 ng/ml TPA. The promoter response to C/EBPβ was analyzed 24 h after transfection by using 0.5 or 1.5 μg of C/EBPβ expression plasmid. Each DNA fragment is defined by its position relative to the β-ST3 transcription start site (+2) illustrated in Figs. 4 and 6. The footprint sequence (FP) at position −31 relative to the β-ST3 transcription start site includes the repeated that is specifically protected (as illustrated in Fig.2 B). The values are representative of three independent experiments performed in triplicate with inter-experimental variations not exceeding 20%.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether an additional ST3 mRNA was transcribed, semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed on RNA extracted from either RD cells or human placenta with a 5′-primer (XU112, nucleotides −1663 to −1637) upstream of the splice site and a 3′-primer (XV225) complementary to the 3′-untranslated region in the last exon of the ST3 gene. This 3′-primer was also used with a 5′-primer (nucleotides +75 to +97, YA160) designed from the first exon (E1α) of the α-ST3 transcript originally characterized. The resulting RT-PCR products were hybridized with an ST3-specific ST3 probe (Fig. 3 A). The expression of the α-ST3 transcript was found to be induced in RD cells in response to RA, and higher levels of this transcript were observed in human placental tissue, further supporting previous observations (8Basset P.

https://openalex.org/W2040164071,"The “pocket proteins” pRb (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein), p107, and p130 regulate cell proliferation via phosphorylation-sensitive interactions with E2F transcription factors and other proteins. We previously identified 22 in vivo phosphorylation sites in human p130, including three sites selectively targeted by cyclin D-Cdk4(6) kinases. Here we assessed the effects of alanine substitution at the individual or combined Cdk4(6)-specific sites in p130, compared with homologous sites in p107 (Thr369/Ser650/Ser964). In U-2-OS cells, the triple p107ΔCdk4* mutant strongly inhibited E2F-4 activity and imposed a G1 arrest resistant to cyclin D1 coexpression. In contrast, the p130ΔCdk4mutant still responded to cyclin D1, suggesting the existence of additional phosphorylation sites critical for E2F-4 regulation. Extensive mutagenesis, sensitive E2F reporter assays, and cell cycle analyses allowed the identification of six such residues (serines 413, 639, 662, 1044, 1080, and 1112) that, in addition to the Cdk4-specific sites, are necessary and sufficient for the regulation of E2F-4 and the cell cycle by p130. Surprisingly, 12 of the in vivophosphorylation sites seem dispensable for E2F regulation and probably modulate other functions of p130. These results further elucidate the complex regulation of p130 and provide a molecular mechanism to explain the differential control of p107 and p130 by cyclin-dependent kinases. The “pocket proteins” pRb (retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein), p107, and p130 regulate cell proliferation via phosphorylation-sensitive interactions with E2F transcription factors and other proteins. We previously identified 22 in vivo phosphorylation sites in human p130, including three sites selectively targeted by cyclin D-Cdk4(6) kinases. Here we assessed the effects of alanine substitution at the individual or combined Cdk4(6)-specific sites in p130, compared with homologous sites in p107 (Thr369/Ser650/Ser964). In U-2-OS cells, the triple p107ΔCdk4* mutant strongly inhibited E2F-4 activity and imposed a G1 arrest resistant to cyclin D1 coexpression. In contrast, the p130ΔCdk4mutant still responded to cyclin D1, suggesting the existence of additional phosphorylation sites critical for E2F-4 regulation. Extensive mutagenesis, sensitive E2F reporter assays, and cell cycle analyses allowed the identification of six such residues (serines 413, 639, 662, 1044, 1080, and 1112) that, in addition to the Cdk4-specific sites, are necessary and sufficient for the regulation of E2F-4 and the cell cycle by p130. Surprisingly, 12 of the in vivophosphorylation sites seem dispensable for E2F regulation and probably modulate other functions of p130. These results further elucidate the complex regulation of p130 and provide a molecular mechanism to explain the differential control of p107 and p130 by cyclin-dependent kinases. retinoblastoma protein cyclin-dependent kinase hemagglutinin glutathione S-transferase The retinoblastoma protein (pRb)1 and the related proteins p107 and p130, collectively known as pocket proteins, are involved in regulation of the cell cycle, differentiation, cellular senescence, and cell death (1Wang J.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 2Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 3Grana X.

Whereas pRb is a tumor suppressor, a potentially analogous role of p107 and p130 in preventing tumorigenesis is still a matter of debate (5Paggi M.G. Giordano A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4651-4654PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, evidence for essential functions of p107 and p130 in negative control of cell cycle progression has recently emerged (2Classon M. Dyson N. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 6Bruce J.L. Hurford R.K., Jr. Classon M. Koh J. Dyson N. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3051-3064Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). pRb, p107, and p130 exert their functions through interactions with a large number of cellular proteins via multiple independent binding sites (3Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 9Morris E.J. Dyson N.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 2001; 82: 1-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The so-called A/B pocket is such a binding site, originally defined in pRb. This pocket structure encompasses an A- and a B-domain, separated by an insert sequence (10Hu Q.J. Dyson N. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1147-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 11Huang S. Wang N.P. Tseng B.Y. Lee W.H. Lee E.H.

The A/B pocket is necessary for binding to viral oncoproteins and other proteins containing the motif LXCXE and is conserved in p107 and p130 (14Ewen M.E. Xing Y.G. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 15Li Y. Graham C. Lacy S. Duncan A.M. Whyte P.

Grana X. Baldi A. Sang N., Hu, Q. Giordano A. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2561-2566PubMed Google Scholar). Many of the known effects of pocket proteins depend on their ability to repress gene expression by binding members of the E2F family of transcription factors. The direct targets of E2Fs include genes whose products are critical for embryonic development and tissue homeostasis (18Müller H. Bracken A.P. Vernell R. Moroni M.C. Christians F. Grassilli E. Prosperini E. Vigo E. Oliner J.D. Helin K. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 267-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 19Ishida S. Huang E. Zuzan H. Spang R. Leone G. West M. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4684-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The high affinity DNA binding form of E2F is a dimer consisting of one subunit from the DP protein family (DP-1 or DP-2) and one of six E2Fs (E2F-1 to E2F-6). The carboxyl terminus of the E2F subunit binds directly to the so-called “large A/B pocket” of pRb, p107, and p130 in a manner compatible with simultaneous binding of the pocket with LXCXE containing proteins (20Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas p130 and p107 preferentially bind E2F-4 and E2F-5, pRb can interact with all E2Fs except for E2F-6, which lacks the transactivating domain. p130 is highly expressed in quiescent cells, where it forms the predominant E2F complex. When cells enter the cell cycle and pass the so-called restriction point in middle to late G1 (21Bartek J. Bartkova J. Lukas J. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 237: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), p107 is induced and becomes the major E2F binding partner at the G1/S transition. Complexes of pRb are mainly found in G1, but they also exist in quiescence (G0) and in S phase (22Nevins J.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar, 23Helin K. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1998; 8: 28-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). p107 and p130 redundantly repress a subset of E2F targets distinct from the subset of genes controlled by pRb (24Hurford R.K., Jr. Cobrinik D. Lee M.H. Dyson N. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1447-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). The pocket proteins repress transcription by direct inhibition of the transactivating domain of E2Fs (25Flemington E.K. Speck S.H. Kaelin W.G., Jr. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6914-6918Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 26Helin K. Harlow E. Fattaey A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6501-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 27Hiebert S.W. Chellappan S.P. Horowitz J.M. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) and by recruitment of nucleosome-remodeling enzymes to the E2F-pocket protein complex, thereby changing chromatin into a transcriptionally less active state (28Harbour J.W. Dean D.C. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2393-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar). A characteristic difference distinguishing p107 and p130 from pRb is their binding to cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin A-Cdk2, a function that cooperates with repression of E2Fs to inhibit the cell cycle (29Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 30Zhu L. Enders G. Lees J.A. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1904-1913Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Woo M.S. Sanchez I. Dynlacht B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3566-3579Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The regulation of pRb function by cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation has provided a framework for the understanding of the regulation of the other two pocket proteins. The inactivation of pRb is carried out in middle to late G1 by phosphorylation of serine and threonine residues, mediated by the sequentially activated cyclin D-Cdk4(6) and cyclin E-Cdk2 kinase complexes. When hyperphosphorylated, pRb loses its binding potential, and induction of E2F target gene transcription is one of the downstream effects (3Grana X. Garriga J. Mayol X. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3365-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). p107 and p130 are also phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (33Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Mayol X. Garriga J. Grana X. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 801-808PubMed Google Scholar), and G1 phase cyclin-Cdk-mediated phosphorylations are required to dissociate the E2F-4(5)-p130 complex (35Smith E.J. Leone G. DeGregori J. Jakoi L. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6965-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The importance of p107 and p130 phosphorylation for cell cycle progression is suggested by the growth arrest imposed by overexpression of phosphorylation-deficient mutants of p107 and p130 in tumor cell lines resistant to the corresponding wild-type proteins (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 36Ashizawa S. Nishizawa H. Yamada M. Higashi H. Kondo T. Ozawa H. Kakita A. Hatakeyama M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11362-11370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although the cell cycle regulation of p130 and p107 by phosphorylation is broadly reminiscent of the control over pRb, some important differences exist in the ways phosphorylation affects the individual pocket proteins. First, cyclins A and E are not dissociated by hyperphosphorylation of p107 and p130, thereby providing a phosphorylation-insensitive function (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Second, p130 harbors a unique region in the B-domain, with several phosphorylation sites targeted by non-Cdk kinases (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 37Canhoto A.J. Chestukhin A. Litovchick L. DeCaprio J.A. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5116-5122Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Third, p107 and p130 can be mutually distinguished through their differential responses to G1 cyclin-Cdks in vivo. Thus, phosphorylation of p130 and dissociation of E2F-4 can be achieved by either Cdk4(6) or Cdk2, and it occurs even in cells deficient in cyclin D-associated kinase activity. In contrast, Cdk2 activity is insufficient to release E2F-4 from p107, and this process requires the activity of Cdk4(6) (33Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,38Xiao Z.X. Ginsberg D. Ewen M. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 39Cheng L. Rossi F. Fang W. Mori T. Cobrinik D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30317-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Fourth, SV40 virus T-antigen binds to hyperphosphorylated forms of p107 and p130 but not of pRb, indicating a nonequivalent regulation of LXCXE-mediated protein interactions by phosphorylation (40Knudsen E.S. Wang J.Y. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Other LXCXE-mediated interactions, however, are controlled by phosphorylation, as exemplified by the reduced affinity of phosphorylated p107 for histone deacetylase (41Ferreira R. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Robin P. Harel-Bellan A. Trouche D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10493-10498Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Fifth, the fact that only three out of 22 in vivo phosphorylation sites in p130 are conserved in pRb (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) suggests that p130 is subject to unique modes of regulation. There is a growing appreciation of the involvement of p107 and p130 in cell cycle regulation, and better understanding of how their activities are controlled is needed. In this study, we identify a distinct subset of in vivo phosphorylation sites in p130 necessary for regulation of E2F-4 and the cell cycle. In addition, a complementary subset of phosphorylation sites of p130 has only a minor influence on E2F-4-mediated transcription and cell cycle control. The latter phosphorylation sites may be involved in regulating processes distinct from E2F-4 binding. Comparative analysis of p130 with p107 suggests a functional conservation of the Cdk4-specific phosphorylation sites but also a striking difference in phosphorylation site usage between p107 and p130, providing an explanation for the differential kinase sensitivities of the two proteins. The human cell lines U-2-OS and T98G were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. Except for in vivo labeling experiments, transfections were performed by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (42Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 9.1.4-9.1.6Google Scholar) in dishes of cells grown to 30–50% confluence. The plasmid used for expression of HA-tagged wild-type p130 (HAp130wt) in eukaryotic cells, pcDNA.1-HAp130wt, was reported previously (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid for HA-tagged p107 was created by digesting a synthetic double-stranded DNA encoding the HA-tag withNsiI and HpaI (sense strand, GCATAAAATGCATACCCCTACGACGTGCCCGACTACGCCTGTTAACTGCAGT) and inserting it downstream of the last sense codon in a previously described p107 expression plasmid (43Zhu L. van den Heuvel S. Helin K. Fattaey A. Ewen M. Livingston D. Dyson N. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1111-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). The NsiI andHpaI sites were introduced using a pair of complementary mutagenesis primers (sense strand, GAAAGAGCAAATCATGCATGTTGTTGTTAACTCTATGATAAAAGCAC) as described (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Other point mutations in the p130 and p107 genes were created similarly. Mutants with more than one of the four clusters of phosphorylation sites completely substituted with alanines were created by joining regions using restriction enzymes as follows: p1303600 was made by joiningHindIII-Eco81I fragments from p1303000 and p1300600; p1303006 by joining HindIII-Eco81I fragments from p1303000 and p1300006; p1300670 by joining HindIII-PaeI fragments from p1300600 and p1300070; p1300606 by joining HindIII-PaeI fragments from p1300600 and p1300006; p1303606 by joining HindIII-Eco81I fragments from p1303000 and p1300606; p1303670 by joining HindIII-PaeI fragments from p1303606 and p1300070; p1303676 by joining HindIII-ScaI fragments from p1303670 (completely digested) and p1300006(partial digestion with ScaI). HAp130PM9A was constructed by joining the HindIII-PaeI fragments of a plasmid with mutations in codons 401, 413, 639, 662, 672 and a plasmid with mutations in codons 1035, 1044, 1080, 1112. HAp130PM12A was made similarly from a plasmid mutated in codons 642, 688, and 694 and a plasmid mutated in codons 948, 952, 962, 966, 973, 982, 986, 1068, and 1097. A Gal4-E2F-4 fusion protein expression plasmid was created by inserting a PCR product encoding full-length E2F-4 in the plasmid pM (CLONTECH) in the EcoRI and BamHI sites. The PCR primers contained these sites as 5′-extensions. The reporter construct 5×GAL-luc was created by PCR amplification of the region in pG5CAT (CLONTECH) containing the five GAL4 binding sites and the minimal promoter of the adenovirus E1b gene and insertion into the SacI and HindIII sites of pGL3-basic (Promega). The PCR primers contained these sites as 5′-extensions. A plasmid for expression of GSTp130wt fusion protein in bacteria (pGEX-2tp130wt) was created by joining aBamHI-XbaI fragment (partial digestion withXbaI) of pcDNA.1-HAp130wt to the vector pGEX-2t opened with BamHI and XbaI. The plasmid for expression of GSTp130PM22A was made similarly from pcDNA.1-HAp130PM22A. Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation were performed as in Ref. 31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar. Antibodies 12CA5 and SC805 or SC7392 against the HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used in immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, respectively. Antibodies to p130 (SC317), E2F-4 (SC866), and cyclin A (SC751) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GST-p130wt and GST-p130PM22A were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain Bl21pLys from pGEX-2t. The E. coli cells were grown to A600 = 1 and harvested. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction was omitted to avoid the appearance of incomplete fusion proteins. Cell extract was prepared as described (44Farkas T. Kutskova Y.A. Zimarino V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 906-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) in E. coli lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml), and leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml)). One pull-down reaction contained an amount of fusion protein derived from 10 ml ofE. coli culture, precoupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads, and 250 μg of protein from U-2-OS. The reaction was incubated at 4 °C for 90 min with gentle end-over-end mixing. Beads were washed three times in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20) supplemented with aprotinin (2.5 μg/ml), leupeptin (2.5 μg/ml), and dithiothreitol (1 mm) and boiled in 40 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer; 20 μl was analyzed by immunoblotting. U-2-OS cells were seeded in 6-cm dishes and transfected with the indicated type and amount of plasmid DNA. Sonicated salmon sperm DNA was added to a total of 8 μg of DNA per transfection. Forty hours after transfection, the cells were harvested and processed for reporter assays as described (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a Berthold Lumat LB95d instrument. The β-galactosidase assay was performed in 300 μl as follows: 30 μl of cleared lysate in 270 μl of reaction buffer (67 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 1.5 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.25% β-mercaptoethanol). The reaction was stopped by adding 500 μl of Na2CO3 (1 m). Optical density at 420 nm was measured. Relative luciferase activity was obtained by normalizing to β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in duplicate and repeated independently at least three times. Within one experiment, the fluctuation of the measured values did not exceed 10%. All measurements were performed so that the light intensities and optical densities were recorded within their respective linear ranges. The presented data were calculated as ratios between the activities of the pocket protein containing samples to those obtained from control transfected cells (transfected with either empty vector or with wild type p130 plasmid (see legends in Figs. 1B, 3, and 4B)). The latter control had been included repeatedly in each separate experiment. Because its value differs in separate measurements due to varying transfection efficiencies, it was arbitrarily set to 100 to allow comparison of multiple independent experiments.Figure 3Functional mapping of individual phosphorylation sites in p130 important for E2F-4 regulation.Plasmids expressing the indicated p130 constructs (500 ng) were tested for repression of cotransfected 5×Gal-luc (1 μg) and Gal4-E2F-4 (25 ng) in U-2-OS cells. A CMV-LacZ construct (500 ng) was cotransfected and used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Thediagrams in the top, middle, andbottom show repression data for alanine substitutions made in the A-domain proximal cluster of phosphorylation sites, the spacer domain, and the C-domain, respectively. The phosphorylation sites substituted for alanine in the mutants are indicated beloweach lane. The results are mean and S.D. values of three independent experiments. Effects of substitutions on reporter activity were related directly to p130wt, thereby defining the activity of Gal4-E2F-4 in the presence of p130wt as 100. The immunoblotsbelow the diagrams were made as follows. U-2-OS cells were transfected with 1 μg of the indicated p130 expression plasmid and 0.1 μg of the luciferase expression plasmid pCMV-luc. The p130 derivatives were immunoprecipitated with one anti-HA antibody (12CA5) and immunoblotted using another anti-HA antibody (Y-11). The input volumes of cell lysate in immunoprecipitations were normalized for transfection efficiency by measuring the luciferase activity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 4p130PM9A and p130PM12A have strong and weak ability, respectively, to regulate and bind E2F-4 and show specific loss of phosphopeptides corresponding to mutated residues. A, the diagram indicates the alanine substituted residues in p130PM9A and p130PM12A. Phosphopeptides in the maps are numbered according to their appearance in the primary amino acid sequence; identical numbers are used for residues located on the same tryptic phosphopeptide. Anasterisk indicates sample application point. Thearrows indicate the location of phosphopeptides giving rise to only a weak signal at the selected exposure. Thearrowhead indicates the location of a phosphopeptide of unknown identity (The “B2” spot described by Hansen et al. (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)). We cannot explain the specific loss of B2 in the p130PM12A map. The existence of two phosphopeptides numbered 3 is due to a single and a double phosphorylation on the peptide containing Ser639 and Thr642. The existence of two phosphopeptides numbered 8 is due to an incomplete tryptic digest of the most positively charged peptide (the spot 8 migrating outermost right). B, repression of E2F-4 transactivation. Left part, U-2-OS cells were transfected with the indicated p130 constructs (0.5 μg), 5×Gal-luc (1 μg), Gal4-E2F-4 (25 ng), and CMV-LacZ (0.5 μg). The results are mean and S.D. values of three independent experiments. The effects of mutants on reporter activity were related directly to the effect of p130wt, defined as 100. Right part, same as left but cotransfected with either 2 μg of pX-p16 expression vector or pX empty vector as indicated.C, expression level of p130 mutants and coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous E2F-4. Left part, expression plasmids (1 μg) for the indicated HA-tagged p130 constructs were transfected into U-2-OS cells together with pCMV-luc (0.1 μg). HA-tagged p130 was immunoprecipitated with the anti-HA antibody, 12CA5, and immunoblotted for the HA-tag or E2F-4. To obtain equal signals in the p130wt, p130PM12A, p130PM9A, and p130PM22A lanes, volumes of extract with the following predetermined relative amounts of luciferase activity were immunoprecipitated: 1; 1.2; 3.5; 3.5, respectively. The total protein input in immunoprecipitations was kept constant by supplementing with U-2-OS lysate from untransfected cells.Right part, same as left part but cotransfected with 2 μg of pX-p16 expression vector; the input ratios of transfection units in immunoprecipitations were all equal to 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) U-2-OS cells were seeded in 10-cm dishes and transfected with 5 μg of pCMV-CD20 and the indicated amounts and types of pocket protein expression plasmids. Empty vector was added to a total of 15 μg of DNA per transfection. Occasionally 0.1 μg of pCMV-Luc was cotransfected as transfection control; in that case, one-third of the cells were analyzed for luciferase activity, as described above, and two-thirds were processed for flow cytometry, essentially as described (45Sorensen C.S. Lukas C. Kramer E.R. Peters J.M. Bartek J. Lukas J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3692-3703Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). T98G cells were electroporated in the presence of the indicated plasmid DNA and labeled 42 h later for 4 h with [32P]orthophosphate (2 mCi/ml) in phosphate-free medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Phosphopeptide maps were made as described previously (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Previously, we identified 22 in vivophosphorylation sites in p130 (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Among those, three were specifically targeted by Cdk4(6) (referred to here as Cdk4-specific), whereas most of the other phosphorylation sites were more general Cdk sites targeted by both Cdk4(6) and Cdk2. In vivo phosphorylation sites in p107, on the other hand, have not yet been systematically studied. Sequence alignments revealed conservation of 10 of the in vivo phosphorylation sites between p130 and p107, including all three Cdk4-specific sites (Fig.1A, top). A strict dependence on cyclin D-Cdk4(6) kinase activity for dissociation of p107 from E2F-4 has been described (33Beijersbergen R.L. Carlee L. Kerkhoven R.M. Bernards R. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1340-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 38Xiao Z.X. Ginsberg D. Ewen M. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4633-4637Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas Cdk2-associated kinase activity alone is sufficient to dissociate p130 from E2F-4 (39Cheng L. Rossi F. Fang W. Mori T. Cobrinik D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30317-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This difference between the two related pocket proteins prompted us to compare the influence of the Cdk4-specific sites in p107 and p130 on E2F-4 activity, using the mutant p130ΔCdk4 with the three Cdk4-specific sites substituted with alanine (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 422-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and the homologous triple-alanine mutant p107ΔCdk4* made in this study (the asterisk indicates that the notion of Cdk4 specificity here is based on homology to p130). Our assay measured repression of a luciferase reporter with five Gal4 binding sites in front of a minimal promoter. Coexpressing the fusion protein Gal4-E2F-4, which contains the DNA binding domain of Gal4 fused to full-length E2F-4, induces transcription 250-fold higher than the Gal4 domain alone (data not shown). We refer to this activity as E2F-4-induced. This reporter type was chosen for its high sensitivity and ability to assess the E2F-4 pocket protein interaction. Before activity measurements, we estimated the impact of the triple-alanine substitution (T369A,S650A,S964A) on the global phosphorylation status of p107 by tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of in vivo 32P-labeled p107 versus p130 as a reference. The four phosphopeptides representing the Cdk4-specific sites are, as previously published (31Hansen K. Farkas T. Lukas J. Holm K. Ronnstrand L. Bartek J. EMBO J. 2001; 20:"
https://openalex.org/W2013851674,"X chromosome inactivation is the silencing mechanism eutherian mammals use to equalize the expression of X-linked genes between males and females early in embryonic development. In the mouse, genetic control of inactivation requires elements within the X inactivation center (Xic) on the X chromosome that influence the choice of which X chromosome is to be inactivated in individual cells. It has long been posited that unidentified autosomal factors are essential to the process. We have used chemical mutagenesis in the mouse to identify specific factors involved in X inactivation and report two genetically distinct autosomal mutations with dominant effects on X chromosome choice early in embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2074063177,"We investigated the regulation of prostaglandin production in normal endometrial stromal cells (ESC) by malignant endometrial epithelial cells. We found that cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 mRNA and protein levels and prostaglandin (PG)E2production in ESC were significantly increased by Ishikawa malignant endometrial epithelial cell conditioned medium (MECM). By using transient transfection assays, we found that the −360/−218-bp region of the COX-2 promoter gene was critical for MECM induction of promoter activity. This MECM-responsive region contained a variant nuclear factor (NF)-κB site at −222 to −213 that, when mutated, completely abolished COX-2 promoter activation by MECM. Employing electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we further demonstrated that binding of NF-κB p65 to this NF-κB-binding site is, in part, responsible for the COX-2 promoter activation by MECM. To investigate further the potential effects of MECM onCOX-2 mRNA stability, ESC were treated with MECM in the absence or presence of actinomycin D, a general transcription inhibitor. We found that MECM significantly increased COX-2mRNA stability. Intriguingly, we found that PGE2 was one of the major factors in MECM, which was responsible for up-regulating COX-2 expression in ESC. ECC-1 and HEC-1A malignant endometrial epithelial cell lines also produced significantly increased quantities of PGE2.

The proposal that PGs contribute to carcinogenesis is supported further by compelling evidence that inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX) activity (and thereby of PGs formation) protect against colon, mammary, esophageal, and lung cancer in humans (1Subbaramaiah K.

The increased amounts of PGs in tumors reflect enhanced synthesis, which occurs by COX-catalyzed metabolism of arachidonic acid. PGs are synthesized from arachidonic acid by two different isoforms of COX, referred to as COX-1 and COX-2. They share ∼60% identity at the amino acid level and have similar enzymatic activities, but although they catalyze the same reaction, these two isoforms have been suggested to have distinct biological functions (2Smith W.L.

COX-1 is constitutively expressed in most mammalian tissues and is thought to carry out housekeeping functions such as cytoprotection of the gastric mucosa, regulation of renal blood flow, and control of platelet aggregation. In contrast, COX-2mRNA and protein are normally undetectable in most tissues but can be rapidly induced in response to proinflammatory or mitogenic stimuli, which included various cytokines, growth factors, oncogenes, endotoxins, and chemicals (6Yamamoto K.

Specific staining for COX-2 could be found only in the surface and glandular epithelium in normal endometrium but not in the endometrial stroma. On the other hand, not only the COX-2 expression in the surface and glandular epithelia of the endometrial cancer was increased as compared with normal endometrium, an increase in the COX-2 immunostaining in the stroma of the endometrial cancer relative to that of normal endometrium was also noted. Similar results have been described for colon carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, and malignant melanoma (24Shattuck-Brandt R.L. Varilek G.W. Radhika A. Yang F. Washington M.K. DuBois R.N.

These results were suggestive of a cross-talk between malignant epithelial cells and surrounding stromal cells to favor COX-2 expression in the endometrial tumors. To test this hypothesis, the present investigation was designed to examine the direct effect of conditioned medium of a cancerous endometrial cell line (Ishikawa cells) on COX-2 expression in normal stromal cells of the human endometrium. We hypothesized that malignant epithelial cells secreting factor(s) that act in a paracrine fashion might be responsible for increased COX-2 expression in the stromal cells. In addition, we attempted to characterize the criticalcis-acting elements that mediate induction the humanCOX-2 gene expression in normal endometrial stromal cells by malignant endometrial epithelial cell conditioned medium. Actinomycin D (Act D, general transcription inhibitor), indomethacin (non-selective COX-1 and -2 inhibitor), and PGE2 were purchased from Sigma. Nuclear factor (NF)-κB consensus double-stranded oligonucleotide was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Antibodies against NF-κB p50, NF-κB p65, NF-κB p52, RelB, c-Rel, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)α, C/EBPβ, and C/EBPδ were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). All other materials used in the study are indicated in the appropriate context below. Human normal endometrial tissues were obtained at the time of surgery from reproductive aged women (n= 12) who were undergoing hysterectomy for advanced cervical dysplasia after obtaining informed consent following a protocol approved by the Office for Protection of Research Subjects of the University of Illinois, Chicago. These patients did not receive hormonal treatments and not take anti-inflammatory drugs (especially COX inhibitors) before surgery. Six specimens were in the proliferative phase, whereas the other six were secretory. No differences in experimental results were noted with respect to the cycle phase. Normal endometrial stromal cells (ESC) were cultured using a protocol reported previously (27Tamura, M., Sebastian, S., Yang, S., Gurates, B., Fang, Z., and Bulun, S. E. (2002) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,in pressGoogle Scholar). The cells were studied at passage 4–6. Confluent ESC were serum-deprived for 16 h in serum-free, phenol red-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (DMEM/F-12) before subjected to the following two treatments: (i) serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 as the base-line control; (ii) serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 conditioned with Ishikawa human malignant endometrial epithelial cells (malignant epithelial cell conditioned medium (MECM)). Treated ESC were then used to isolate total RNA for reverse transcriptase-PCR, whole cell protein extracts for Western blot analysis, and nuclear extracts for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The conditioned medium was generated in the following fashion. Ishikawa epithelial cells were initially grown in 75-cm2 flasks in DMEM/F-12 with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (250 ng/ml) (growth medium). After Ishikawa cells were grown to confluence, culture medium was switched to serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 containing antibiotics for a 16-h washout period to collect MECM. Then the cells were incubated in new serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 containing antibiotics for 72 h to allow accumulation of secreted factors in the medium. We collected MECM and centrifuged it to remove the cell debris. The supernatant were transferred to a clean tube and immediately frozen and kept at −80 °C for the future use. As an additional control, serum-free, phenol red-free DMEM/F-12 incubated with HES human benign endometrial epithelial cell line (benign epithelial cell conditioned medium (BECM)) was prepared following a similar procedure described above. We also generated the conditioned media from ECC-1 human malignant endometrial epithelial cell line (ECC-1CM), HEC-1A human malignant endometrial epithelial cell line (HEC-1ACM), T47D human malignant mammary epithelial cell line (T47DCM), MCF-7 human malignant mammary epithelial cell line (MCF-7CM) and LNCaP human malignant prostate epithelial cell line (LNCaPCM) following a similar procedure described above. For assessing the concentration dependence, MECM was concentrated 5- or 10-fold in an Ultrafree PF-60 Ultrafiltration Device using 5,000 molecular weight cut-off membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). ESC were cultured in 100-mm dishes until confluent in the growth medium as described above and switched to serum-free, phenol red-free media for 16 h. These cells were then incubated under various conditions, i.e.control or MECM for 8 h. Total RNA was isolated from ESC using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. For RT-PCR analysis of COX-2mRNA, the SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was used to synthesize the first strand cDNA as instructed by the supplier. Briefly, 5 μg of total RNA isolated from ESC was treated with DNase I (1 units/μl). One μl of this was reserved for PCR amplification with primers specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), providing a control for equal starting amounts of total RNA in samples and PCR efficiency. The remainder of the DNase-treated RNA was directly reverse-transcribed. One μl of the reverse transcriptase reaction mix was used for PCR with oligonucleotide pairs specific for COX-2 and GAPDH. The nucleotide sequences of the primer pairs employed and PCR conditions were reported previously (27Tamura, M., Sebastian, S., Yang, S., Gurates, B., Fang, Z., and Bulun, S. E. (2002) J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab.,in pressGoogle Scholar). The PCR cycle numbers were 38 for COX-2 and 30 for GAPDH. PCR performed with the original RNA sample after DNase I digestion (see above) did not yield any products, confirming that amplified products were dependent on the presence of template generated by reverse transcription and not the result of contamination with extraneous DNA. Aliquots of the reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in an agarose gel and ethidium bromide staining. Intensity of PCR products was quantified using the Quantity One 1-D Analysis Software (Bio-Rad). We assert that these data are semi-quantitative (relative to control GAPDH) based on the following test performed prior to data analysis. Both products were assayed in the linear response range of the RT-PCR amplification process; the cycle number used in this assay was determined by finding the midpoint of linear amplification on a sigmoidal curve for both amplification products with cycle numbers 25–42 plotted against band density (see Fig. 1 A). ESC were plated in 6-well tissue culture plates in the growth medium as described above and allowed to become established as confluent monolayers for 24 h. All of the cells were serum-depleted for at least 16 h and treated with control or MECM (2 ml/well). Stimulations were performed for 24 h, and the supernatants were transferred to clean microcentrifuge tubes. Two 100-μl aliquots of supernatant/sample were assayed by prostaglandin E2 Immunoassay Kit (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of PGE2 was determined for competitive binding enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using the Microplate Reader, model 550 (Bio-Rad). These measurements were made in duplicate and repeated in three separate experiments. ESC were cultured in 100-mm dishes until confluent in the growth medium as described above and switched to serum-free, phenol red-free media for 16 h. These cells were then incubated under various conditions, i.e. control, BECM, or MECM for 8 h. Total protein was extracted from whole cells using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Protein concentration was measured using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The lysate (20 μg of total protein) was mixed with 6× standard electrophoresis sample buffer and fractionated on an SDS-PAGE (4% stacking gel, 7.5% resolving gel) at 25 mA for 4 h. Protein samples were then electroblotted to the Trans-Blot nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm) (Bio-Rad). The membrane was then incubated with an anti-COX-2 polyclonal antibody at 1:5,000 dilution (0.04 μg/ml) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated similarly with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), diluted in blocking buffer 1:100,000, for 1 h at room temperature. The signal was detected using SuperSignal West Femto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate Chemiluminescence Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol and exposed to BioMax ML x-ray film (Eastman Kodak) for less than 2 min. Band intensity of protein expression was quantitated using the Molecular Analyst version 1.5 software (Bio-Rad). Construction of the deletion mutants containing specific regions of the human COX-2 gene promoter in the luciferase reporter vector pGL3 Basic (Promega, Madison, WI) was accomplished using PCR amplification of the desired region using the recombinant plasmid containing a 7-kb promoter region of the humanCOX-2 gene (kindly provided Dr. Stephen M. Prescott, University of Utah, Salt Lake City) as the template. For each PCR, primer pairs used to amplify specified regions of the COX-2promoter region had suitable flanking restriction sites that forced cloning of the fragment in the desired orientation into the pGL3 basic vector. Orientation and sequence of all constructs were verified by direct sequencing using the ABI PRISM 377 DNA Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Mutant construct, phCOX2(KBM), with a mutation at the NF-κB site was constructed as described previously (28Schmedtje J.F., Jr., Ji, Y.S. Liu W.L. DuBois R.N. Runge M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 601-608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). Briefly, the sequence was changed from GGGGACTACC to GGccACTACC, the lowercase nucleotides indicate the mutations. The mutations and the orientation of insert were confirmed by direct sequencing. Plasmid used in the transfection experiment was purified using an EndoFree Plasmid Isolation Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and purity was verified by spectrophotometry and agarose gel electrophoresis. The day before transfection, ESC were plated into 6-well tissue culture plates at a density such that the cells reached 70–80% confluence by the time of transfection. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Invitrogen), following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Each transfection was done using 0.4 μg of firefly luciferase reporter construct DNA that contains serial deletion and site-specific mutants of COX-2 promoter gene and 1 ng of an internal control Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI). Three hours after transfection, the transfection medium was removed by aspiration; 2 ml of DMEM/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics was added, and the plates were returned to the incubator for 16 h. Cells received serum-free DMEM/F-12 for an additional 16 h and were then switched to control or MECM for another 24 h. Then medium was removed, and wells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline to remove detached cells and residual growth medium. Then 250 μl of 1× passive lysis buffer, provided in the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI), was added per well. Ten μl of supernatant was used for assay of luciferase activities. Luciferase activities were determined using the LUMAT LB9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies GmbH & Co. KG, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized based on theRenilla luciferase activity in each well. These measurements were performed in triplicate and repeated in three independent experiments. ESC were cultured in 100-mm dishes until confluent in the growth medium as described above and switched to serum-free media for 16 h. These cells were then incubated with control or MECM for 16 h. Nuclear protein was extracted from whole cells using NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (Pierce), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Protein concentration was measured with a BCA Protein Assay Kit (Pierce), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (see below) were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol at 10 mCi/ml) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (10 units/μl) (Promega, Madison, WI). Approximately 20,000 cpm of labeled probe and 0.5 μg of nuclear extract were incubated for 10 min at 30 °C in a reaction mix (total volume, 20 μl) containing 4% (v/v) glycerol, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC). For supershift experiments, 2 μl of antibody was added, and incubation was continued for an additional 1 h on ice. Samples were then analyzed on nondenaturing 6% acrylamide gel. Dried gels were exposed to Biomax MR x-ray film (Kodak). We used the following double-stranded probes. NF-κB site wild type probe (5′-CAGGAGAGTGGGGACTACCCCCTCTGCT-3′) was designed to represent a 28-bp-long sequence (−232/−205 bp). NF-κB site mutant probe (5′-CAGGAGAGTGGccACTACCCCCTCTGCT-3′) was designed to represent a 28-bp-long sequence (−232/−205 bp). The underlined nucleotides indicate the transcription factor binding domain, and the lowercase nucleotides indicate the mutations. Statistical analysis for comparison between treatment groups was performed by one-way analysis of variances followed by Tukey's multiple comparison test using the StatView 5.0 statistical software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).p < 0.05 was considered significant. All values are given as the mean, with the bars (in all figures) showing S.E. We initially carried out experiments to evaluate the optimal conditions for determining the effects of MECM on COX-2mRNA levels in ESC. The time course of COX-2 mRNA abundance as examined by RT-PCR showed an increase following treatment at 4 h and peaked at 8 h (data not shown). Based on this observation, the ESC were treated with control or MECM for 8 h (Fig. 1, A and B). To determine where PCR amplification for COX-2 mRNA was in the logarithmic phase, total RNA isolated from ESC treated with MECM was reverse-transcribed and was amplified under different cycle numbers. Single PCR products were obtained for COX-2. A linear relationship between PCR products and amplification cycles was observed for COX-2 treated with MECM in ESC (Fig. 1 A). Consequently, 38 cycles for COX-2 were employed for quantification. Compared with the control, MECM treatment significantly increased the COX-2mRNA level in ESC (Fig. 1 B). PCR was also performed using an aliquot of the same RT products for the housekeeping gene GAPDH mRNA to control for the RT reaction, PCR efficiency, and equal starting amounts of total RNA. There was no apparent change in the GAPDH mRNA abundance with MECM treatment. It should be pointed out that COX-2 seems to be constitutively expressed in Ishikawa malignant epithelial cells in relatively high levels (Fig.1 B, 1st lane). Quantitative densitometry for three independent experiments confirmed these results. We also performed a time course experiment for COX-2 protein levels in ESC treated with MECM employing Western analysis. COX-2 levels started to increase at 4 h, and peak level was observed at the 8-h treatment time (Fig. 1 C, part of data not shown). To examine the specificity of effects of MECM on ESC, we used BECM to treat ESC and compared with MECM by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Incubation with BECM did not increase COX-2 levels demonstrating that the stimulatory effect was specific for malignant endometrial epithelial cells. These results demonstrate that malignant endometrial epithelial cells in culture produce specific factor(s), which stimulate COX-2 expression. To determine whether the induction of COX-2mRNA and protein levels was correlated with comparable changes in PGE2 production, PGE2 concentrations were measured in culture media of ESC after MECM treatment. The effect of MECM on the PGE2 synthesis in ESC is shown in Fig.2. PGE2 synthesis by ESC was measured after incubation in control or MECM. Incubation of ESC with MECM for 24 h caused a significant increase in the PGE2 concentration in the medium by 4.2-fold compared with base-line PGE2 levels in MECM itself or by 3.2-fold compared with incubation in control medium. Deletion and site-specific mutants of COX-2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene constructs were transiently transfected to ESC and treated with MECM (24 h). As shown in Fig.3 A, an induction in promoter activity upon MECM treatment was observed only in the reporter construct containing the COX-2 promoter region −360/−218 bp, indicating that a critical regulatory region at −360/−218 bp was responsible for this induction. Sequence analysis of this region and the literature review (5Tazawa R., Xu, X.M., Wu, K.K. Wang L.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 203: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) revealed the existence of an NF-κB-binding site at −222/−213 bp. Site-directed mutation of this NF-κB-binding site significantly reduced MECM-induced COX-2 promoter activity in ESC (Fig. 3 A). Thus, the presence of this NF-κB element (−222/−213 bp) was required, at least in part, for MECM-mediated induction of COX-2 promoter in ESC. The concentration-dependent effect of MECM on COX-2gene induction in ESC was evidenced by the transient transfection experiments using 5- and 10-fold concentrated MECM (Fig.3 B). Compared with a consistently observed 1.5-fold induction in −360/+56-bp construct by 1× MECM, treatments with 5 and 10× concentrated MECM elicited >2-fold inductions of COX-2promoter activity in ESC. EMSA was performed using nuclear proteins from ESC treated with control or MECM to determine the protein/DNA binding activities at the NF-κB site. Nuclear extract from ESC incubated with control medium was composed of two faint but specific bands, upper and lower. Interestingly, nuclear extract prepared from MECM-treated cells showed strikingly more intense upper and lower complexes, suggesting increased protein/DNA binding activity at NF-κB site upon MECM treatment (Fig.4 A). Preincubation with a cold wild type −232/−205-bp probe completely abolished both shifted bands. Conversely, the cold −232/−205-bp probe containing a mutation in NF-κB (−222/−213-bp) element had no effect on the complex formation, confirming the specificity of the reaction. Furthermore, a generic probe containing a consensus NF-κB element also abolished both complexes. To determine which proteins were responsible for the formation of the two inducible nuclear complexes, supershift experiments using antibody directed against members of the NF-κB/Rel family (p65, p50, p52, RelB, and c-Rel) were performed (Fig.4 B). Only the antibody against the NF-κB subunit p65 completely eliminated the formation of the lower complex. Antibodies against the p50, p52, RelB, or c-Rel, however, did not affect the formation of DNA-protein complexes. Comparable results were obtained using nuclear extracts derived from HeLa cells (data not shown). From these experiments, we concluded that p65 composed the lower complex. It should be noted that inability of any of the other members of the NF-κB family to compete or supershift the upper complex indicates involvement of additional transcription factor(s) in thi"
https://openalex.org/W2078784388,"Eukaryotic RNA polymerase II andEscherichia coli RNA polymerase possess an intrinsic ribonuclease activity that is stimulated by the polymerase-binding proteins SII and GreB, respectively. This factor-activated hydrolysis of nascent RNA has been postulated to be involved in transcription elongation as well as removal of incorrect bases misincorporated into RNA. Little is known about the frequency of misincorporation by RNA polymerases in vivo or about the mechanisms involved in improving RNA polymerase accuracy.

Yeast lacking SII did not display a significant change in reporter activity when compared with wild-type cells. We estimate that under our assay conditions, mRNAs with a misincorporation at the test site could not exceed 1 transcript per 500 cells. The reporter assay was very effective in detecting the previously described process of nonsense suppression (translational read-through) by ribosomes, making it difficult to determine an absolute level of basal (SII-independent) misincorporation by RNA polymerase II. Although these data cannot exclude the possibility that SII is involved in proofreading, they make it unlikely that such a contribution is physiologically significant, especially relative to the high frequency of translational errors.

Many DNA polymerases contain a nuclease activity that allows them to excise, from newly replicated DNA, bases that are misincorporated with respect to Watson-Crick base pair rules. With the recognition that many, if not all, multisubunit DNA-dependent RNA polymerases contain a nuclease activity that operates on nascent RNA came the suggestion that RNA polymerases proofread RNA misincorporation events using this activity (1Reines D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3795-3800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K.

For bacterial RNA polymerase, this nuclease activity is stimulated by small RNA polymerase-binding proteins called GreA and GreB (4Borukhov S. Sagitov V. Goldfarb A. Cell. 1993; 72: 459-466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A similar activity in eukaryotic RNA polymerases is stimulated by a small RNA polymerase II-binding protein called SII (also known as TFIIS) that has been found in all eukaryotes so far investigated. The greA and greBgenes are not essential for Escherichia coli; nor is the SII-encoding gene essential for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (5Orlova M. Newlands J. Das A. Goldfarb A. Borukhov S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4596-4600Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar,6Nakanishi T. Nakano A. Nomura K. Sekimizu K. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13200-13204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, these proteins can reactivate RNA polymerase enzymes that lapse into an elongation-incompetent form (7Wind M. Reines D. Bioessays. 2000; 22: 327-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). They do so by activating cleavage of the nascent RNA chain by RNA polymerase. The vast majority of nascent RNA is assembled according to strict Watson-Crick base pairing rules. Hence, these proteins have been considered transcription elongation factors. In vivoevidence consistent with this role has been described (8Hsu L.M., Vo, N.V. Chamberlin M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In vitro, misincorporation of nucleotides into RNA by RNA polymerase can be detected by experimental manipulations such as providing a high level of a nucleotide other than that called for by the DNA template. For example, GTP can be incorporated into RNA at a low frequency when poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) is used as a template for bacterial RNA polymerase (15Ozoline O.N. Oganesjan M.G. Kamzolova S.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 16Springgate C.F. Loeb L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 97: 577-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In vitro, RNA polymerase II poised at a specific template thymine has been shown to incorporate a G residue in lieu of A when ATP is absent (2Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1998; 93: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Similarly, E. coli RNA polymerase will incorporate C instead of U when UTP is absent (17Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H. Science. 1993; 262: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Both polymerases have been shown to misincorporate a U instead of C on a synthetic template (18Jeon C. Agarwal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13677-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). GreA, GreB, and SII stimulate the cleavage of nascent RNA containing misincorporated bases (2Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1998; 93: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 17Erie D.A. Hajiseyedjavadi O. Young M.C. von Hippel P.H.

Thus, it has been suggested that these factors could assist in the fidelity of transcription by activating RNA polymerase to excise these misincorporated bases (2Thomas M.J. Platas A.A. Hawley D.K. Cell. 1998; 93: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar,18Jeon C. Agarwal K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13677-13682Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). However, there is no direct evidence that RNA polymerases employ this factor-activated nuclease activity in vivo. The misincorporation rate of RNA polymerase in vivo has not been accurately measured in eukaryotic cells. A frequency of ∼10−5 has been estimated for misincorporation inE. coli; however, the rate varies as a function of the nucleotide substituted, the identity of the template base, the divalent cation, and presumably, sequence context around the substitution (15Ozoline O.N. Oganesjan M.G. Kamzolova S.G. FEBS Lett. 1980; 110: 123-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,16Springgate C.F. Loeb L.A. J. Mol.

Neither the biological sequelae of misincorporation nor the extent to which nuclease-stimulating factors participate in proofreading are well understood, particularly in eukaryotes. Errors in protein synthesis have been described and estimated previously in bacteria and yeast using reporter systems (19Rosenberger R.F. Hilton J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 191: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Herbert P. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. Tuite M.F. J. Mol.

Parameters that influence translational fidelity include genetic background, antibiotics, and epigenetic states. Typically, the fidelity of translation has been considered less stringent than that of transcription (19Rosenberger R.F. Hilton J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1983; 191: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 23Ninio J. Biochimie (Paris). 1991; 73: 1517-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 24Ninio J.

In an effort to examine the contribution of transcriptional and translational errors and SII's potential role in proofreading, we have designed a reporter system to detect misincorporation events mediated by RNA polymerase II at an artificial stop codon engineered into a plasmid introduced into yeast. Using yeast strains with a deletion or a disruption of the SII-encoding gene (DST1), we were unable to find evidence that this cleavage-activating factor participates in proofreading. On the other hand, translational read-through of stop codons was readily detected using pharmacological and genetic approaches and could be readily measured. Rates of SII-independent misincorporation by RNA polymerase appear to be small relative to the higher rates of translational errors such as stop codon bypass. The plasmid pGAL-LUC has been described previously (26Brodsky J.L. Lawrence J.G. Caplan A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18045-18055Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and was obtained from A. Caplan (Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, New York). The sequence ( … TACAAAGGA … ), encoding Lys445 and the flanking amino acids (Tyr upstream and Gly downstream), was changed to ( … TCCTAGGGA … ) by site-directed mutagenesis (Gene Dynamics, LLC) to generate the plasmid pLuc-Stop. The mutagenesis generates a novel AvrII restriction site (underlined) that also changes the Tyr codon to Ser and the Lys codon to a stop codon. The stop codon in pLuc-Stop was then changed a base at a time to AAG, CAG, GAG, TCG, TGG, TTG, and TAA to generate the plasmids pGAL-LUC-AAG, pCAG-LUC, pGAG-LUC, pTCG-LUC, pTGG-LUC, pTTG-LUC, and pTAA-LUC, respectively. The pLUC-Δ plasmid was made by religating pLuc-Stop that had been digested with AvrII and SacI after treating the linear DNA with T4 DNA polymerase. The plasmid p2X-Stop was generated by site-directed mutagenesis of the sequence around codon 445 in pLuc-Stop from … TCC TAG GGA … to … TCC TAG TGA … The strains used in this study are described in TableI. Cells were transformed with plasmids by the lithium acetate/polyethylene glycol method (27Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Johnston J.A. Molecular Genetics of Yeast: Practical Approaches.

Cells from a saturated culture were diluted to an A 600 of 0.05–0.1 and grown to an A 600 of 0.5 at 30 °C with aeration. The culture was treated with galactose (2% (w/v) final concentration), and triplicate samples of 0.5 OD unit of cells were collected at the indicated times and frozen at −80 °C. Cell pellets were thawed at 4 °C for assay and lysed by vortexing (30 s followed by 30 s on ice) 10 times with 40–50 μl of acid-washed glass beads in 60 μl of luciferase lysis buffer (Promega Corp.). Samples were spun for 30 s at 15,000 × g in a microcentrifuge. A standard assay used 40 μl of cell extract in 100 μl of assay substrate (Promega), but samples were diluted in reaction buffer as necessary to keep signals in the linear range of the luminometer. Samples were mixed, and luminescence was read immediately at 22 °C in a Optocomp I Luminometer (GEM Biomedical, Pineville, NC). Recombinant luciferase was purchased from Promega. Total RNA was isolated from thawed cell pellets by the hot phenol extraction method and quantitated by measuring absorbance at 260 nm (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Chapter 4. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York1988Google Scholar). Total RNA (15 μg) was resolved on a 1% (w/v) agarose, 7% (v/v) formaldehyde gel and blotted onto Zeta-probe GT nylon membrane (Bio-Rad). Filters were baked at 80 °C for 2 h and prehybridized for a minimum of 3 h at 42 °C in 5× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015 sodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 50% (v/v) formamide, 1% (w/v) SDS, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were hybridized under the same conditions with ∼108 cpm of 32P-labeled DNA probe for 15–18 h. The filters were washed twice at 22 °C in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min each and twice in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min each, followed by two 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS washes at 42 °C for 20 min each. The washed filters were exposed to X-Omat film and quantitated with a Fuji BAS1000 phosphorimaging system. The luciferase probe was a polymerase chain reaction product generated from pGAL-LUC using the oligonucleotides 5′-TTCCATCTTCCAGGGATACG-3′ and 5′-TCGCGGTTGTTACTTGCATG-3′. The probe was labeled to a specific activity of ∼107 to 108 cpm/μg with Klenow DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), random hexamer primers (Invitrogen), and [α-32P]dATP (AmershamBiosciences). We sought to establish an in vivo assay that would provide a positive readout of a transcriptional misincorporation event. S. cerevisiae was selected because of a relatively well developed understanding of RNA polymerase II elongation from genetic, biochemical, and molecular biological analyses. Using transformation, we introduced a reporter plasmid into wild-type cells and cells deleted or disrupted for DST1, the gene that encodes transcription elongation factor SII. Yeast is also advantageous, since a large number of cells can be analyzed, and under inducing conditions the GAL1 promoter can be used to generate numerous reporter transcripts per cell, thereby optimizing the ability to detect a rare event. Firefly luciferase was chosen as a reporter, since the activity assay is simple to perform and has a high signal/noise ratio. The lacZ reporter, which has been used for similar purposes in bacteria, may be atypical with respect to transcription and particularly elongation in yeast cells (29Tabtiang R.K. Herskowitz I. Mol.

We constructed a selectable centromeric plasmid (pLuc-Stop) that contained the inducible GAL1 promoter driving transcription of the 550-amino acid luciferase open reading frame with a premature stop codon replacing lysine 445 (Fig. 1). Introduction of this stop codon has been shown previously to destroy the protein's activity, and it has been used as a reporter in E. coli to assess transcription on mismatch-containing DNA (33Sala-Newby G.B. Campbell A.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1206: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 34Viswanathan A. You H. Doetsch P.W. Science. 1999; 284: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Nine different RNA polymerase II misincorporation events are possible at the introduced UAG stop codon triplet: A, G, or C instead of U at position 1; U, C, or G instead of A in position 2; and A, C, or U instead of G at position 3 (Fig. 1). One of these would yield another stop codon (UAG → UAA). The others would result in transcripts that would lead to the substitution of Gln, Glu, Leu, Ser, Trp, or Tyr (two events) for Lys (Fig. 1). One of the changes would restore a codon for lysine (AAG), the natural residue. If misincorporation did not result in abortion of full-length transcript synthesis, and the aforementioned amino acid substitutions led to active luciferase (see below), misincorporation should be detectable as luciferase activity after galactose induction in cells harboring the stop codon-containing plasmid. If the SII protein encoded by the DST1 gene contributes to proofreading, then a deletion of DST1 should result in an increase in luciferase activity, since misincorporation levels would be higher in these cells. Stop codon read-through by the translation machinery would be an alternative way to yield full-length protein and luciferase activity. Yeast cells harboring a reporter with an intact luciferase reading frame were able to generate luciferase activity that was inducible upon exposure to galactose (Lys, Fig.2 A) (26Brodsky J.L. Lawrence J.G. Caplan A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 18045-18055Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). A strain bearing the plasmid encoding a UAG stop codon at position 445 was severely compromised in its ability to generate luciferase, producing a level of activity ∼300-fold lower than Lys445 after 30 min of galactose induction (Fig. 2 A, compare Lys withStop; note broken y axis scale). Longer induction times resulted in the additional accumulation of luciferase exhibiting ∼105 relative light units in a standard assay (data not shown). Similar activity levels were measured in cells with a plasmid containing the UAA stop codon (Fig. 2, UAA). Activity from the pLuc-Stop plasmid could result from a residual level of enzyme activity of the truncated luciferase polypeptide. Alternatively, “leaky” read-through of the stop codon-containing mRNA by the translation machinery and/or a basal level of misincorporation by RNA polymerase II could yield full-length active protein from the mutation-containing plasmid. To test whether the truncated protein had residual enzyme activity, two control plasmids were created. In one, the luciferase coding sequence downstream of the stop codon at position 445 was deleted (pLUC-Δ). This plasmid could only yield truncated protein regardless of the efficiency of transcriptional or translational read-through. The second control plasmid (p2X-Stop) had a second stop codon engineered in tandem with the first. Thus, two sequential stop codon read-through events or misincorporation events would be required on the same transcript to obtain functional full-length luciferase, an event with a very low probability of occurrence. Cells containing either of these plasmids expressed only background activity (Fig. 2 A, Luc-Δ and 2× Stop). Western blotting showed that the amount of each of the truncated proteins generated in cells carrying pLUC-Δ or p2X-Stop was similar to that produced by cells with full-length luciferase (data not shown). This suggests that the majority of the enzyme activity generated by the pLuc-Stop plasmid comes from translational read-through of the stop codon or transcriptional misincorporation and not from residual activity of the truncated proteins. To test if active luciferase can be produced by the possible amino acid substitutions expected from transcriptional misincorporation (Fig. 1), we generated a family of plasmids with the cognate single base mutations that change the stop codon to Leu, Trp, Gln, Glu, or Ser. These were compared with luciferase encoding the natural lysine residue at position 445. Plasmids were introduced individually into wild-type yeast and the level of inducible luciferase activity was measured after galactose induction. The luciferase enzymes produced by these substitutions were as active as that containing lysine445(shown for the Gln substitution in Fig. 2 A; data not shown for the other substitutions). We conclude that active luciferase enzyme can be produced by eight of the nine misincorporation events at the DNA-encoded stop codon, and we should be able to score them using this luciferase reporter system. (The ninth possible change, which yields a UAA stop codon, would not be informative.) To test whether SII plays a role in misincorporation, we transformed the stop codon-containing luciferase reporter plasmid into a strain of yeast deleted for theDST1 open reading frame. If SII enhanced the fidelity of transcription, cells lacking it would show an increased level of transcripts containing misincorporated bases that should code for active luciferase. However, after a 3-h galactose induction, these cells generated luciferase activity comparable with, or slightly less than, that seen for cells expressing wild-type SII (Fig.2 B). Cells lacking SII are defective in transcriptional induction of a number of genes (10Lennon J.C. Wind M. Saunders L. Hock M.B. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Shaw R.J. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7427-7437Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 35Shimoaraiso M. Nakanishi T. Kubo T. Natori S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29623-29627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To ensure that the luciferase activity determinations were not biased by a difference in luciferase mRNA levels between the DST1 deletant and cells wild-type forDST1, we measured the amount of transcript by Northern blotting (data not shown). When luciferase activity was normalized to the abundance of luciferase mRNA in each sample, the values were indistinguishable for SII-containing and SII-lacking strains (Fig.2 C). Messenger RNAs containing a premature stop codon can be substrates for the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway (36Lykke-Andersen J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R88-R91Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To compare the mRNA degradation rates of the luciferase mRNAs bearing the stop codon, lysine codon, or tryptophan codon at position 445, we measured mRNA half-life by inhibiting transcription by the addition of glucose and by quantifying the mRNA decay rate. All of these mRNAs showed similar half-lives (25–30 min), indicating that differential mRNA turnover cannot account for differences in the yield of luciferase activity for mRNAs encoding wild-type, missense-containing, or prematurely truncated luciferases (Fig.3). From these results, we conclude that there is no evidence that SII affects misincorporation by RNA polymerase II, at least as assessed in this assay system. A crucial question is whether this assay would detect transcriptional misincorporation if it took place, especially if translational read-through of the stop codon takes place at high frequency. There are no known genetic changes that lead to an increase or decrease in misincorporation by RNA polymerase II that could serve as a positive control for an error-prone polymerase. Nor are there experimental perturbations proven to alter misincorporation by RNA polymerases in vivo. As an alternative test of the assay's sensitivity, we resorted to the use of a drug that enhances the frequency of translational read-through of a stop codon. The antibiotic paromomycin has been shown to induce stop codon read-through in yeast as well as in other organisms (see Ref. 20Stansfield I. Jones K.M. Herbert P. Lewendon A. Shaw W.V. Tuite M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar; reviewed in Ref. 37Schroeder R. Waldsich C. Wank H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Wild-type cells harboring pLuc-Stop were induced with galactose to express luciferase and then treated with the antibiotic paromomycin or left untreated. A strong, time-dependent increase in luciferase activity was observed after treatment of wild-type cells with paromomycin compared with untreated cells (Fig.4, ○). After 7.5 h, the paromomycin-treated cells showed an ∼6-fold increase in luciferase activity. Note as well that after this long induction period, untreated yeast with a disruption of DST1 again displayed luciferase activity comparable with wild-type cells with the pLuc-Stop plasmid (Fig. 4, ● versus ▪). This latter result provides further confirmation of the data shown in Fig.2 B. Here, however, a different laboratory strain of yeast was used in which the DST1 gene was disrupted by ahisG cassette (10Lennon J.C. Wind M. Saunders L. Hock M.B. Reines D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5771-5779Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The paromomycin experiment shows that the assay was able to detect the induction of full-length active luciferase from transcripts containing a stop codon at position 445. Certain strains designated Ψ+ show a prion phenotype in which the translational termination factor Sup35p becomes aggregated (reviewed in Refs. 38Mugnier P. Tuite M.F. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1999; 64: 1360-1366PubMed Google Scholar and 39Serio T.R. Lindquist S.L. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 98-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Such strains demonstrate nonsense suppression in the absence of known suppressor mutations that is probably due to loss of translation terminating activity. Since our assay appears to be measuring translational read-through, we were interested in testing the effect of the Ψ+ phenotype upon translational read-through of the stop codon-containing luciferase reporter. pLuc-Stop was introduced into a known Ψ+ strain and a cognate Ψ− strain, the cells were induced with galactose, and cells were assayed for luciferase activity. The Ψ+ strain expressed 8–32-fold more enzyme activity than the Ψ− strain depe"

Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999Google Scholar). More than 60 actin-binding proteins have already been identified in mammalian cells, among which 7 are F-actin cross-linking/bundling proteins (2Almo S. Pollard T.D. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The function of actin cross-linking/bundling proteins is believed to mediate interactions between actin filaments to form both orthogonal networks and ordered bundles. Orthogonal networks and bundles appear, sometimes concurrently, in specialized subcellular complexes, including lamellipodia, filopodia, stress fibers, and focal adhesions. These organelles, which coordinate cell migration and cell spreading (3Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3278) Google Scholar), often contain more than one actin cross-linking protein. For instance, stress fibers in adherent epithelial cells and fibroblasts contain α-actinin, fascin, and tensin (4Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar), which are proteins shown to have the actin cross-linking/bundling function in vitro. Focal adhesions, which mechanically couple the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix via cell surface receptors integrins, contain the actin cross-linking proteins α-actinin, talin, plectin, fimbrin, and vinculin (5Johnson R.P. Craig S.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 74-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Actin-filament bundles in stable microspikes and isotropic meshworks in the lamellipodia of motile cells also contain several actin cross-linking proteins, including fascin and α-actinin and the Arp2/3 complex, α-actinin, myosin, and fascin, respectively (6Ayscough K.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 102-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The fact that several actin cross-linking/bundling proteins co-localize to subcellular organelles suggests that these proteins complement each other and/or have overlapping functions. The relative tolerance of cells to null mutation of genes that code for a single cross-linking protein suggests that the functions of actin cross-linking proteins are highly redundant (7Witke W. Schleicher M. Noegel A.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 8Rivero F. Koppel B. Peracino B. Bozzaro S. Siegert F. Weijer C.J. Schleicher M. Albrecht R.

This apparent functional redundancy may, however, reflect the limited resolution of available assays in assessing the mechanical role of F-actin cross-linking/bundling proteins in vitro and in vivo. Recent ultrastructural work on developing Drosophila has begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which actin cross-linking proteins that co-localize in certain subcellular regions could synergistically operate. Tilney and co-workers showed that singed and forked proteins, two putative actin cross-linking proteins, were both required for proper formation of actin filament bundles in the mechanosensory bristles of Drosophila (10Tilney L.G. Connelly P. Smith S. Guild G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1291-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 11Tilney L.G. Connelly P.S. Vranich K.A. Shaw M.K. Guild G.M. J.

Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 87-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Forked proteins are necessary in the early development of the F-actin bundles that singed proteins subsequently stabilize via a zippering mechanism. How singed and forked proteins can complement one another to produce the propulsive forces required for the development of sensory bristles is however unknown. Networks of actin filaments exhibit relatively poor mechanical resilience, they only resist relative shear deformations of amplitude smaller than 3% (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); moreover, the elasticity of F-actin networksin vitro is much lower than that of that found in living cells (14Yamada S. Wirtz D. Kuo S.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1736-1747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Actin filaments, therefore, harness auxiliary proteins to self-organize into stiff structures that can strengthen the cytoplasm. Here, using reconstituted actin filament networks, we investigated how two types of actin cross-linking proteins could enhance the resilience of actin filaments synergistically. Resilience is measured by the shear amplitude at which the modulus of a network under stress begins to decrease, presumably due to the breakage and/or alignment of the filaments by the applied stresses. This work focuses on α-actinin and fascin, two F-actin cross-linking proteins that co-localize along stress fibers and in lamellipodia of epithelial cells and fibroblasts (15Matsudaira P. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Our rheological measurements show that these two proteins can generate microfilament arrays that are more resilient and more elastic than each one of these proteins separately. A finite element model of networks containing filaments and bundles show that a mechanical optimum is reached between an all-filament and all-bundle networks. Unless specified, all reagents were purchased from Sigma. Actin was prepared from chicken breast (16Tseng Y., An, K.M. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18143-18150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using Sephacryl S-300 for gel filtration (17MacLean-Fletcher S.D. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Biol. 1980; 85: 414-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Purified actin was stored as Ca2+-actin in continuous dialysis at 4 °C against buffer G (0.2 mm ATP, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mmCaCl2, 1 mm sodium azide, and 2 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Mg2+-actin filaments were generated by adding 0.1 volume of 10× KMEI (500 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 100 mm imidazole, pH 7.0) polymerizing salt buffer solution to 0.9 volume of G-actin in buffer G. α-Actinin was purified from chicken smooth muscle as described (18Xu J. Wirtz D. Pollard T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9570-9576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar); α-actinin was stored by dialysis against buffer G, which was changed daily with fresh buffer. Actin and α-actinin were used within 5 days after purification. Human fascin was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion using pGEX2T in the Escherichia coli strain JR600 as described in Ref. 19Apgar J. Tseng Y. Federov E. Herwig M.B. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 1095-1106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar. Fascin was liberated from glutathioneS-transferase by cleavage with thrombin, followed by glutathione-Sepharose chromatography. Fascin was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0, and applied to a DE52 column that was developed with a linear gradient of 0–70 mm NaCl in 10 mm Tris, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0. Purified fascin was dialyzed against 10 mm Tris, 10 mm NaCl, 30 mm KCl, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, pH 8.0, and stored at −70 °C. To probe the mechanical properties of F-actin solutions, we employed a strain-controlled mechanical rheometer (ARES-100 Rheometrics, Piscataway, NJ) as described (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 20Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The superior sensitivity of this rheometer is particularly well suited to probe low viscosity specimen such as F-actin networks. The G-actin solution was first mixed with either fascin, α-actinin, or a mixture of fascin and α-actinin in a test tube; 10× KMEI was added to the solution (total volume 1.4 ml). We note that we did not mix one of the cross-linkers with F-actin and then added the other because strong binding to F-actin can cause the early formation of heterogeneous structures. The solution was immediately loaded onto the lower plate of the rheometer. This plate is coupled to a computer-controlled motor, which can apply steady or oscillatory shear deformations of controlled frequency and amplitude (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The upper tool of the rheometer is a truncated cone (0.04 radian), which is connected to a sensitive torque transducer that measures the stress induced within the F-actin specimen by an applied deformation. The temperature of the specimen was maintained at T = 22 ± 0.1 °C; evaporation was reduced using a vapor trap. The gelation process was monitored until steady state was reached as described (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). At steady state, we determined the shear amplitude-dependent moduli, G(t, γ0) by conducting stress-relaxation experiments where the time-dependent stress, ς(t, γ0) (force per unit area), was measured after a step shear deformation of controlled amplitude γ0 was applied and maintained for 1000 s. The time after application of the step deformation represents a time scale that describes the evolution of the filaments motion in the network (see “Discussion”) and is equivalent to the inverse of the frequency in an oscillatory assay, t = 2π/ω. The amplitude of the deformation was varied from γ0 = 0.5–100%. Since large deformations may break actin filaments, we checked that the network had recovered before applying a new step deformation. A new stress-relaxation experiment was conducted when the overall viscoelastic modulus,‖G*‖=G′2+G″2Equation 1 (evaluated at 2π radian/s and γ0 = 1%), measured during recovery after a stress relaxation measurement, was less than 10% different from the modulus G (evaluated at 1 s) measured during the 1% amplitude step relaxation experiment. From these stress-relaxation measurements, we extracted G(t, γ0) = ς(t)/γ0 as a function of γ0 and time scale t. We also tested the mechanical response of F-actin networks by subjecting them to oscillatory deformations, γ(t) = γ0sinωt, of increasing amplitude γ0. The time-dependent stress, ς(t), was measured and plotted as a function of the applied time-dependent deformation γ(t), which produced so-called Lissajoux figures (21Ma L., Xu, J. Coulombe P.A. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19145-19151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A simple mechanical model, analyzed via the finite element method, was used to supplement the experimental investigations. The model consists of a square plane of orthogonal, equally spaced, cross-linked arrays of individual filaments and filament bundles (Fig. 6, a–a“), pretensioned in-plane, and then loaded out of plane. The selected material properties and rigidities of this model network (i.e. EI, EA, GJ, see below) are based on published measurements of actin structure and rigidity; the network topology is only approximate and is designed to mimic orthogonal networks such as the actin cortex in non-muscle cells. This model does not incorporate the inherent inhomogeneities of F-actin networks (20Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The simulations were conducted using ABAQUS 5.8–16 (HKS 2000). Geometrically non-linear static analysis (large deformations, no inertia terms) was conducted; Newton's method was used for convergence of the equilibrium equations. The filament material was modeled as linear elastic with Young's modulus of E = 2.6 GPa and Poisson's ratio of ν = 0.4 (22Kojima H. Ishijima A. Yanagida T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12962-12966Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). The filaments and filament bundles were modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beam elements (23Gere J.M. Mechanics of Materials. 5th Ed. Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA2001Google Scholar). The cross-section properties of these elements are the cross-sectional areas (A), moments of inertia (I), and St. Venant torsional constants (J) (23Gere J.M. Mechanics of Materials. 5th Ed. Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA2001Google Scholar). These properties for a filament, a 7-filament bundle, and a 19-filament bundle, which were used in the calculations, are given in Table I. The out-of-plane stiffness of the filament bundle network is resisted by the bending, axial, and torsional stiffness of the filaments and filament bundles. In the linear regime, the bending stiffness of a filament is proportional to EI/L 3, the axial stiffness is proportional to EA/L, and the torsional stiffness is proportional to GJ/L, where G = E/ [(2(1 + ν)]. For an individual filament, L is the length between supports; for the filament bundle network the effectiveL is related to the density of crossings and the rigidity of the crossings, i.e. a bundle is more rigid than a single filament. Perfect connection (no slip) was assumed between any two crossing filaments and/or bundles (24Crisfield M.A. Non-linear Finite Element Analysis of Solids and Structures: Advanced Topics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998Google Scholar). A small in-plane pretension (1% of the length) was used on the filament and filament bundle network to engage the axial stiffness of the filaments when loaded out-of-plane. The ends of the filaments and bundles were pinned after the application of the pretension. The total out-of-plane loading was constant for all simulations and uniformly distributed on the filaments (i.e. a 7-filament bundle has seven times the load as an individual filament). The response of the center of the model to the loading was monitored.Table IAssumed geometrical properties of an individual actin filaments and filaments bundles in the modelCross-section area, AMoment of inertia, ISt. Venant torsion, constant J nm 2 nm 4 nm 41 filament643226447-Filament bundle44517,71435,42819-Filament bundle1209129,795290,510These properties were used in the finite-element simulations (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 23Gere J.M.

Open table in a new tab These properties were used in the finite-element simulations (see “Materials and Methods” and Ref. 23Gere J.M. Mechanics of Materials. 5th Ed. Brooks/Cole, Pacific Grove, CA2001Google Scholar for details). Individual filaments are 9 nm in diameter, 10 μm long, and are quite slender (L/r = 4500, where r is the radius if the filament) (Fig. 6 a). Filament bundles consist of seven highly packed, perfectly bonded filaments, as depicted in Fig. 6 a′ and a“. Filament bundles have dramatically higher bending stiffness than a single filament, the moment of inertia I is 55 times greater for the bundle, and filament bundles have lower slenderness, L/r is13 that of an individual filament. Bundles containing 19 filaments were also investigated. Simulations were conducted with the number of filament bundles systematically increased, but the total number of filaments employed held constant at 10,000 (i.e.mass conservation is enforced). Typical arrays are shown in Fig. 6,b–b”. Using rheological methods, we analyzed the mechanical response of reconstituted F-actin networks in the presence of either α-actinin, fascin, or both. We define a network resilience as the shear amplitude at which the network modulus begins to decrease, presumably due to the breakage and/or alignment of the filaments by the applied stresses (25Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O., Ma, L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To measure the resilience and mechanical response, F-actin filament networks were sequentially subjected to step deformations of increasing amplitude γ0, which each induced a rapid stress within the network. The subsequent relaxation of the stress, ς(t), was monitored, from which the relaxation modulus, defined as G(t, γ0) = ς(t)/γ0, was computed. At small shear amplitudes γ0, the curves G(t, γ0) versus t superimposed. This describes the linear regime where the stress ς(t) increases linearly with the input strain amplitude, making the ratio ς(t)/γ0 independent of γ0(Figs. 1 and 2). At large shear amplitudes γ0, G(t, γ0)versus t curves did not superimpose anymore (Figs. 1 and2).Figure 2Strain-induced hardening and softening of F-actin/fascin/α-actinin networks. a and c, relaxation modulus as a function of time scale t of networks containing 24 μm F-actin and 0.24 μm fascin and 0.24 μm α-actin (a) or 0.6 μm fascin and 0.6 μm α-actinin (c).

Despite its ability to promote extensive filament bundling, fascin was unable to enhance the resilience of F-actin networks (Fig. 1). In the linear regime of small deformation amplitudes, the modulus of F-actin/fascin networks was higher than that of F-actin. The stress relaxation modulus, G(t, γ0), remained constant for increasingly small deformations until it monotonically decreased with the time scale (Fig. 1, a and c). The modulus G rapidly decreased with strains of amplitude γ0 > γc (Fig. 1, b and d). This phenomenon, shear-induced softening, occurred at all tested time scales between 0.05–100 s, i.e. shear softening was independent of the rate of deformation. Shear softening is due to either the alignment of the filaments with shear or shear-mediated filament breakage or both. The value of the strain amplitude at which the modulus of F-actin started declining, γc, decreased for increasing time scales (Fig. 3 a). This means that F-actin/fascin networks offered more resilience when sheared rapidly (see “Discussion”). For strain amplitudes larger than γc, the rate of shear softening was relatively independent of both the fascin concentration and the rate of strain (Fig. 1, b and d). In contrast to fascin, α-actinin provided F-actin with additional resistance to shear deformations (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). α-Actinin induced a substantial increase of elasticity particularly at high rates of shear as measured by an increase of G at small deformation amplitudes. Unlike fascin, α-actinin enhanced the modulus for increasing deformation amplitudes (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This phenomenon, strain hardening, was exacerbated at short time scales, i.e. at time scales shorter than the lifetime of binding of α-actinin to F-actin, because sheared filaments did not have the time to slide past one another (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This in turn prevented filaments to relax the stress. The yield strain of F-actin networks was augmented up to 8-fold by α-actinin and decreased with time scale (Fig. 3 a), i.e.α-actinin enhanced the resilience of F-actin networks, a resilience that increased with the rate of shear. The trends observed for α-actinin, including strain hardening and enhanced resilience, were amplified by combining α-actinin and fascin. The stress relaxation modulus increased for increasing strain amplitude over a wide range of time scales (Fig. 2, a andc). Accordingly, the shear modulus displayed a dramatic increase for increasing shear amplitudes, a hallmark of strain hardening, before decreasing at large shear amplitudes (Fig. 2,b and d). Moreover, the yield strain γc of F-actin/fascin/α-actinin networks was increased between 2.5- and 5-fold (depending on the time scale) compared with F-actin networks cross-linked with fascin and α-actinin separately (at least for time scales > 0.05 s), respectively (Fig.3 a). These results indicate a synergistic enhancement of F-actin resilience by combining fascin and α-actinin. To quantify the extent of strain hardening, we introduced the parameter SH = (Gmax − Glow γ)/Glow γ, which is the normalized difference between the modulus measured at the maximum, Gmax, and the (linear) modulus measured at low strain amplitudes, Glow γ (Fig. 3 b). We (obviously) found that SH = 0 for F-actin/fascin networks over a wide range of fascin concentrations since those networks display no strain-hardening. In contrast, SH increased greatly in the presence of α-actinin (Fig.3 B); combining α-actinin and fascin further enhanced that trend. Moreover, the largest modulus reached for increasing strain amplitudes, Gmax, was far greater in networks containing fascin and α-actinin than in networks containing either fascin or α-actinin (inset, Fig. 3 b). This shows that cross-linked networks of actin filaments can strongly stiffen under shear and that combining α-actinin and fascin transform F-actin networks into extremely stiff and resilient structures. We further tested the mechanical response of F-actin networks by subjecting them to oscillatory deformations, γ(t) = γ0sinωt, of increasing amplitude γ0 and measuring the resulting oscillatory stress ς(t) (inset, Fig.4 a). ς(t) was plotted as a function of γ(t) to produce so-called Lissajoux figures (13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) (e.g. Fig. 4 a). In the absence of fascin and α-actinin, we confirmed that when a sinusoidal deformation was applied to F-actin networks, the stress first increased linearly with the applied strain, and then more slowly than strain (see control in Fig. 4 a and Ref. 13Xu J. Tseng Y. Wirtz D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35886-35892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Therefore, an F-actin network subject to large deformations (here 10%) softened rapidly. A similar strain softening behavior, albeit at much larger stresses, was displayed by F-actin networks in the presence of fascin (Fig.4 a), at low and high levels of deformations (Fig.4 b). The behavior of F-actin/α-actinin/fascin networks under shear was fundamentally different from that of F-actin networks and F-actin/fascin networks. F-actin/α-actinin/fascin networks showed a faster-than-linear increase of the time-dependent stress for increasing strain amplitude (Fig.5 a), which indicates a strain hardening behavior. This behavior persisted at very large strain amplitudes (γ0>10%), but the axis of the Lissajoux figures rotated clockwise (Fig. 5 a), which indicated an overall softening of the network. Strain hardening was enhanced by increasing concentrations of cross-linking proteins (Fig.5 b). When networks were subjected to repeated cycles of shear of large amplitude, the apparent modulus was decreased, an effect particularly dramatic at high concentrations of cross-linking proteins (inset, Fig. 5 b). We hypothesized that the origin of this synergistic mechanical effect of α-actinin and fascin was due to the presence of mixed F-actin structures formed by these proteins. α-Actinin forms cross-linked orthogonal networks at low concentrations and loose F-actin bundles at high concentrations (26Wachsstock D. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Fascin mostly bundles F-actin into highly ordered bundles (27Ishikawa R. Yamashiro S. Kohama K. Matsumura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26991-26997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy suggests that F-actin networks in the presence of both fascin and α-actinin display mixed structures containing bundles and orthogonal networks. 2Y. Tseng, B. W. Schafer, S. C. Almo, and D. Wirtz, unpublished results. To better understand the origin of this synergy, we utilized a simplified model of cytoskeletal structures composed of cross-linked networks of filaments and bundles (see “Materials and Methods”). The amount of “filamentous material” employed was constant and equal to 100 × 100 actin filaments. These filaments were symmetrically and orthogonally arranged on a square area of 100 μm2, which was supported around the outer edge (see Fig.6, a and b). The filaments spanned the 100 micrometer distance either as individual filaments or as highly packed perfectly bonded 7-filament bundles (model results were similar for 19-filament bundles). The out-of-plane stiffness of the network of filaments and filament bundles was sensitive to the total number of individual filaments and filament bundles (Fig. 7). The stiffest network consisted neither of all filaments, nor all bundles, but rather a mixture of the two structures (Fig. 7 b). Of the networks of filaments and filament bundles, the network of 79 × 79 filaments and 3 × 3 bundles exhibited the greatest initial and tangential stiffness (for 19-filament bundles: 62 × 62 filaments and 2 × 2 bundles had the stiffest response). The mechanical response of the model exhibited two phenomena qualitatively similar to those observed in the experiments: (i) “strain hardening” of the modulus under deformation (Fig. 7 a) and (ii) the optimum resilience consisted of a mixed system of cross-linked individual filaments and filament bundles (as opposed to purely filaments or purely bundles) (Fig. 7 b). This mechanical behavior grossly corresponds to the cases of F-actin + α-actinin, actin + α-actinin + fascin, or F-actin + fascin considered above in which combinations that induced some filament bundling and some cross-linking provided an optimum solution, as opposed to individual dopants. One of the central functions of cross-linked F-actin networks and F-actin bundles is to provide mechanical support to cytoplasm and reinforce cellular protrusions. We investigated potential mechanical synergism between the two cross-linking proteins, α-actinin and fascin, which co-localize to stress fibers and the lamelipodia of adherent cells. In several respects, the mechanical behavior of F-actin/α-actinin/fascin is intermediate between that of F-actin/α-actinin and F-actin/fascin systems. We previously found that the phase angle of F-actin/α-actinin/fascin networks is intermediate between that of the more solid-like F-actin/fascin network and the more liquid-like F-actin/α-actinin network. 3Y. Tseng, T. P. Kole, B. Schafer, E. Fedorov, S. C. Almo, and D. Wirtz, submitted for publication. The dynamics of F-actin cross-linking/bundling mediated by α-actinin and fascin combined is also intermediate between that of fascin and α-actinin.3 In several key aspects, however, the combination of α-actinin and fascin generate actin filament ultrastructures that synergistically exploit the functions of these proteins. Fascin and α-actinin generate F-actin structures that are more resilient and more elastic than produced by fascin and α-actinin separately. The enhancement of elasticity of F-actin provided by the combination of fascin and α-actinin is spectacularly increased compared with that separately provided by fascin and α-actinin and was about 2 orders of magnitudes higher than that of suspensions of intermediate filaments (keratin or vimentin) or actin microfilaments (25Coulombe P.A. Bousquet O., Ma, L. Yamada S. Wirtz D. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 420-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Combining fascin and α-actinin also greatly enhanced strain-induced hardening and resilience of F-actin. Structural differences among actin cross-linking proteins initially lead researchers to believe that they differed from one another by their propensity to bundle actin filaments. Compact proteins that embody a tandem of two actin binding domains, such as fascin and fimbrin, would bundle filaments via close packing. Instead, antiparallel homodimers of molecules each containing one actin binding domain separated by a long level arm, such as α-actinin and filamin, would induce the formation of orthogonal arrays (2Almo S. Pollard T.D. Quirk S. Vinson V. Lattman E.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 207-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, careful biochemical and physical characterization has now made clear that even the compact protein fascin can both cross-link and bundle F-actin at low and high concentrations, respectively (29Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Vice versa, the archetypal actin cross-linking proteins α-actinin and filamin, which organize F-actin in orthogonal networks at low concentrations, can also bundle actin filaments at high concentrations (30Grazi E. Trombetta G. Magri E. Cuneo P. Schwienbacher C. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 31Wachsstock D. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). In support of this dual structural function, immunofluorescence microscopy has shown that fascin localizes not only in actin bundles that support filopodia but also in orthogonal meshworks of the lamellipodia (32Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Ono S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 993-1006Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 33Adams J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1977-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, α-actinin locates not only in the lamellipodia but also in stress fibers (28Critchley D.R. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Cytoskeletal and Motor Proteins. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 22-23Google Scholar). Therefore, the roles of cross-linking proteins cannot be only distinguished by their propensity to bundle or cross-link actin filaments in vitro. Instead, we suggest that what also distinguishes cross-linking proteins from one another is their mechanical function. We note that in our experiments we mixed fascin and α-actinin first and then added G-actin and the polymerizing salt. We leave to future work the study of how the order of addition of the auxiliary proteins to preassembled F-actin may affect the rheological outcome. Fascin increases F-actin elasticity at levels well below those observed in living cells (14Yamada S. Wirtz D. Kuo S.C. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1736-1747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and does not help F-actin resist shear stresses of large magnitude. α-Actinin greatly enhances the elasticity, resilience, and strain hardening property of F-actin, but not nearly as effectively as α-actinin supplemented with fascin. Our results therefore suggest that cells combine bona fide F-actin bundling proteins such as fascin and bona fide cross-linking proteins such as α-actinin to produce stiff and resilient cytoskeletal structures. While the developed finite element model is not an attempt to duplicate or simulate the experiments, it provides an insight into the mechanism by which actin cross-linking proteins may work synergistically. We have recently observed that the combination of the bundling/cross-linking proteins fascin and α-actinin induces the formation of mixed structures.2 Confocal microscopy reveals that these structures contain both highly ordered bundles and orthogonally oriented filaments as opposed to mostly rigid bundles (fascin alone) (29Tseng Y. Fedorov E. McCaffery J.M. Almo S.C. Wirtz D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 351-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) or mostly orthogonal networks and disorganized bundles (α-actinin alone) (20Tseng Y. Wirtz D. Biophys. J. 2001; 81: 1643-1656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 26Wachsstock D. Schwarz W.H. Pollard T.D. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Our simulations test how these mixed structures may be responsible for the synergistic enhancement of the elasticity of F-actin networks. The existence of an optimum mix of filaments and bundles was by no means obvious from the outset in the mechanical model. Consider that the bending moment of inertia (TableI) for the 7-filament bundles is nearly 8 times greater than the moment of inertia for 7 individual filaments! Thus, an optimum existing of all bundles would seem reasonable. However, as individual filaments are expended to generate the bundles, the density of crossings decreases, weakening the system, in structural terms the “unbraced length” increases as filaments are replaced by bundles. This competition leads to the optimum amount of filaments and bundles shown in Fig. 7 b. The simulations suggest that mechanical modeling of networks of filaments and filament bundles can provide additional insight and explanation for the synergistic response of actin cross-linking proteins as measured in living cells.3"

In this study, we describe for the first time an aminopeptidase from three highly pathogenic Leishmania species. Intronless genes encoding a leucyl aminopeptidase (lap) were cloned fromLeishmania amazonensis, Leishmania donovani, and Leishmania major, which encoded 60-kDa proteins that displayed homology to leucyl aminopeptidases from Gram-negative bacteria, plants, and mammals. The lap genes were present as a single copy in each genome, and lapmRNA was detected by reverse transcription-PCR in all life-cycle stages of L. amazonensis. Lap assembled into catalytically competent 360-kDa hexamers and demonstrated potent amidolytic activity against synthetic aminopeptidase substrates containing leucine, methionine, and cysteine residues, representing the most restricted substrate specificity of any leucyl aminopeptidase described to date. Optimal activity was observed againstl-leucyl-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (k cat/K m ≈ 63 s−1·mm−1) with a pH optimum of 8.5. Leishmania Lap activity was inhibited by metal ion chelators and enhanced by divalent manganese, cobalt, and nickel cations, although only zinc was detected in the purified Lap by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy, indicating that zinc is the natural Lap cofactor. Activity was potently inhibited by bestatin and apstatin in a slow binding competitive fashion, withK i * values of 3 and 44 nm, respectively. Actinonin was a tight binding competitive inhibitor (K i ≈ 1 nm), whereas arphamenine A (K i ≈ 70 μm) andl-leucinol (K i ≈ 100 μm) were non-tight binding competitive inhibitors.

Leishmaniasis is prevalent in 88 countries, with 12 million people currently infected, a further 350 million at risk, and 2 million new cases reported per year. No vaccine exists, and therapies are inadequate (1Handman E. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). There is a pressing need for the identification of novel leishmanial virulence factors, drug targets, and vaccines to improve our understanding, prevention, and treatment of leishmaniasis. The peptidases of parasitic protozoans (for review, see Ref. 2Rosenthal P.J. Adv. Parasitol. 1999; 43: 105-159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are becoming increasingly important as virulence factors, drug targets, and vaccine candidates in parasitic infections. However, only three peptidases from Leishmania, lysosomal cysteine peptidases (3Mottram J.C. Brooks D.R. Coombs G.H. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1998; 1: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), a cell-surface metallopeptidase (4Bouvier J. Schneider P. Etges R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 64-633Google Scholar), and a cytosolic serine oligopeptidase (5Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Morehead J. Caler E.V. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H.T. Andrews N.W.

Aminopeptidases, which catalyze the removal of N-terminal amino acid residues from peptides and proteins (6Taylor A. FASEB J. 1993; 7: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), are emerging as novel and exciting anti-parasite targets. Vaccination of sheep withFasciola leucyl aminopeptidase (Lap)1 elicited high anti-Lap titers that conferred protection against fascioliasis and fascioliasis-related liver damage (7Piacenza L. Acosta D. Basmadjian I. Dalton J.P. Carmona C. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 1954-1961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic broad-spectrum aminopeptidase inhibitors (8Nankya-Kitaka M.F. Curley G.P. Gavigan C.S. Bell A. Dalton J.P. Parasitol. Res. 1998; 84: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and 1,2-aminoalcohol inhibitors of Lap (9Howarth J. Lloyd D.G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2000; 46: 625-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) have shown promise as drugs against malaria, and the aminopeptidase inhibitor arphamenine A has activity against Trypanosoma brucei, a kinetoplastid protozoan that is a close relative ofLeishmania (10Knowles G. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1993; 32: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, no aminopeptidase has ever been studied in any kinetoplastid protozoan parasite, including Leishmania. To address this, we report here the cloning, genetic analysis, and biochemical characterization of a novel aminopeptidase from three highly pathogenic Leishmania species. This aminopeptidase, which is responsible for the bulk of soluble leucyl aminopeptidase activity in Leishmania extracts, appears to represent the most phylogenetically distant branch of the M17 family of leucyl aminopeptidases (EC 3.4.11.1). Leishmania Laps exhibit the most restricted substrate specificity of any Lap described to date, confining activity almost exclusively to three amino acid residues, leucine, cysteine, and methionine. In addition to providing important new data on the enzymology of this interesting family of peptidases, the data we present here considerably expand our knowledge of the peptidolytic capacity of Leishmania, which thus far has been limited to three peptidases, by introducing a newly identified peptidase from these parasites. These data will also serve as a solid foundation for subsequent studies on the potential of this aminopeptidase as a drug target and vaccine candidate inLeishmania infections. Virulent Leishmania major V1 (MHOM/IL80/Freidlin) and Leishmania amazonensis PH8 (IFLA/BR/67/PH8) were from David Sacks (NIAID, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Virulent Leishmania donovani 1S (MHOM/SD/00/1S-2D) was from Albert Descôteaux (Université du Québec, Québec, Canada). Promastigotes were grown in M199 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.1% (m/v) hemin, 10 mm adenine, pH 7.5, at 27 °C. Amastigotes were grown in M199 medium supplemented with 0.25% (m/v) glucose, 0.5% (m/v) trypticase, 40 mm succinate, 10 mm adenine, 0.1% (m/v) hemin, 20% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, pH 5.4 at 31 °C. Using the published sequence of the L. majorFreidlin chromosome (GenBankTM/EBI accession numberAL117384), forward (5′-GCT TCC GAT TCG GAT TCC CAG CG-3′) and reverse (5′-CTG TGA TCG CAC AAC GGT GCA TC-3′) primers were synthesized complementary to non-coding sequences flanking a L. majorORF designated “probable cytosol aminopeptidase.” PCR amplification from Leishmania genomic DNA was carried out by an initial denaturation (95 °C, 2 min) followed by 30 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 1 min), annealing (50 °C, 1 min), and primer extension (68 °C, 2 min) followed by a final extension step (72 °C, 10 min). PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) to create plasmids pNA151 (for the L. major-derived fragment), pNA159 (for the L. amazonensis-derived fragment), and pNA161 (for the L. donovani-derived fragment). Plasmids were sequenced using M13 reverse (5′-CAG GAA ACA GCT ATG AC-3′) and M13 forward (5′-G TAA AAC GAC GGC CAG-3′) primers by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University. Gene copy number was determined by Southern blot. The lapORFs were excised from pNA151, pNA159, and pNA161 and served as templates in random prime labeling reactions (RediprimeTMII system, Amersham Biosciences) with 50 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP to generate 32P-labeledlap DNA probes. Endonuclease-digested Leishmaniagenomic DNA (5–7.5 μg) was resolved on a 0.7% (m/v) agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with the 32P-labeled DNA lap probes. Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC (1× SSC = 0.15 m NaCl and 0.015 m sodium citrate), 0.1% (m/v) SDS (60 °C, 20 min; (5Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Morehead J. Caler E.V.

Stage-specific lap expression was determined by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Total RNA from 3 × 108 L. amazonensis amastigotes and log-(density ≈ 1 × 106 cells/ml) and stationary-phase (density ≈ 5 × 107 cells/ml) promastigotes was isolated with TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A) mRNA was isolated from total RNA with an Oligotex™ mRNA mini kit (Qiagen). RT was undertaken with ThermoScript™ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions, primed with 2.5 μmoligo(dT)20 containing 500 ng of mRNA template. PCR reactions, carried out as described above, contained forward (5′-ATG CTT CGT CGC GTG CTG TCT CGC GG-3′) and reverse (5′-TTA AGG CTT GTT GTG GCG CAG GAA GT-3′) primers and 2 μl of cDNA generated in the RT reaction (or 2 μl of an RT reaction to which no reverse transcriptase had been added as negative control). The lap genes were amplified by PCR from Leishmania genomic DNA withPfuTurbo polymerase (Stratagene) as described above, with forward primer (5′-GC ACC CCT CAT ATG ATG CTT CGT CGC GTG CTG TCT CGT-3′ for L. major and L. amazonensis and 5′-GC ACC CCT CAT ATG ATGCTG CGC CGC GTG CTG TCT CGC-3′ for L. donovani) and reverse primer (5′­GC ATC CTTCAT ATGTTA¯¯AGG CTTGTT GTG GCG CAG GAA G­3′) (built-in NdeI sites are in bold, initiation codons are underlined, and the stop codon is double-underlined). PCR products were cloned into the NdeI site of pET15b (Novagen), creating pNA155 (L. major Lap), pNA165 (L. amazonensis Lap), and pNA169 (L. donovani Lap) expression constructs. Sequencing with a T7 forward primer (5′-TAA TAC GAC TCA CTA TAG G-3′) demonstrated that the ATG start codon was in-frame. Constructs were transformed into E. coli BL21 (λDE3). N-terminal polyhistidine-tagged fusion proteins were expressed by induction of log-phase cultures (500 ml;A 600 ≈ 0.6) with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C with vigorous (300 rpm) shaking. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF), 10 μm l-trans- epoxysuccinylleucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E-64), and 10 μm pepstatin A, pH 7.9 (25 ml, 4 °C), and sonicated with a Branson Sonifer 250 sonicator (duty cycle = 80%, output = 8; 4 × 2 min). Centrifuged (15 000 ×g, 15 min, 4 °C) extracts were filtered through 0.45-μm filters, and peptidases were purified on nickel-agarose resin (Novagen) per the manufacturer's specifications. In some instances, the polyhistidine tag was removed using a thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen) per the manufacturer's specifications. Sample purity was evaluated on a Coomassie Blue-stained 12% Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gel (11Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of active Lap was determined with Lap (2 μg), preincubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 8 (12 h, 4 °C), and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-300 HR gel filtration column (16 × 600 mm, 0.8 ml·min−1), preequilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm MnCl2, pH 8. Fractions (0.5 ml) were assayed for l-Leu-AMC amidolytic activity (described below). The column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (669 kDa), ferritin (443 kDa), IgG (160 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa) standards. Substrate specificity of recombinant Lap was determined using fluorogenic substrates by preincubation of Lap (1 nm, 37 °C, 1 min) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmMnCl2, pH 8, followed by the addition of substrate. Initial steady-state velocity was determined by continuous assay for a range of substrate concentrations in a Hitachi F-2000 spectrofluorimeter (λex = 370 nm, λex = 460 nm for AMC and λex = 340 nm, λex = 410 nm for β-naphthylamine), and a Amersham Biosciences Ultrospec 2000 at 405 nm for para-nitroaniline. The K m andV max were determined by hyperbolic regression of the kinetic data using Hyper 1.01 (obtained from Dr. J. S. Easterby, University of Liverpool, UK). The k catwas determined from k cat =V max/[E]0, where [E]0 represents the concentration of Lap monomers (by mass, assuming 100% activity). The [E]0 for recombinant Lap was determined using molecular masses of 62.424, 62.337, and 62.569 kDa for the L. amazonensis, L. donovani, and L. major enzymes, respectively, which takes into account the added mass of the affinity tag. The Lap pH profile was determined by incubating Lap (2 nm, 37 °C, 5 min) in constant ionic strength acetate/Mes/Tris (AMT) buffers (50 mm acetic acid, 50 mm Mes, 100 mm Tris-HCl (12Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), pH 4–11) before the addition ofl-Leu-AMC. The pH stability was determined by incubating Lap (20 nm, 37 °C) in these AMT buffers (1 h) before assaying residual activity of a 5-μl aliquot in pH 8 AMT buffer. Ionic strength dependence was investigated by assaying Lap activity in pH 8 AMT buffer over the ionic strength range 0.01–0.5. Metal ion dependence of Lap was investigated by assaying Lap activity after preincubation of Lap (1 nm, 37 °C, 30 min) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, containing a metal chloride (0.01–10.0 mm). Metal cations were also tested for their ability to re-activate metal-depleted Lap (apo-Lap) by incubating L. amazonensis Lap (10 mg) with 1,10-phananthroline (10 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8m for 16 h. Phenanthroline was removed by dialysis against 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8 (4 × 4 h, 4 °C). Apo-Lap was concentrated in Centricon YM-10 spin concentrators (Millipore), and aliquots (containing 125 ng protein) were incubated with metal chlorides (1–5 mm, 30 min) before assaying activity againstl-Leu-AMC in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8 at 37 °C. Inhibition of Lap by peptidase inhibitors was determined by preincubation of Lap (2 nm, 37 °C) with inhibitors in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, pH 8 for 5 min before the addition of substrate. In the presence of metal ion chelators, MnCl2 was omitted from the assay buffer. TheK i for non-tight binding reversible competitive inhibitors was determined as described in Salvesen and Nagase (13Salvesen G. Nagase H. Benyon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: A Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford1989: 83-104Google Scholar). The enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of l-Leu-AMC was monitored continuously to establish an uninhibited rate of substrate hydrolysis (v 0), after which a 20-fold molar excess of inhibitor over enzyme was added (in less than 5% of the total assay volume), and the new steady-state velocity in the presence of the inhibitor (v i) was determined. The apparent inhibition constant in the presence of substrate (K i (app)) was given byv 0/v i = 1 + [I]/K i (app), where [I] denotes inhibitor concentration. For tight binding inhibitors (where the [E]0/K i ratio >0.01 (14Bieth J.G. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar)), the method of Williams and Morrison (15Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar) was employed. Briefly, Lap (5 nm) was incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, pH 8 at 37 °C alone or with inhibitor (at a concentration of 0.5–2.5 × [E]0) before assaying residual activity against l-Leu-AMC (20–50 μm). A plot of velocity in the presence of inhibitor (v i ) at inhibitor concentration [I] was fitted to the general integrated equation v i = (v 0/2[E]0) × (((K i (app) + [I] − 2[E]0)2 + 4K i (app)[E]0)½+ (K i (app) + [I] − [E]0)) using non-linear regression with SigmaPlot® (Jandel Scientific) to obtainK i (app), the apparent inhibition constant in the presence of substrate (15Williams J.W. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 437-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). In both tight and non-tight binding cases, the true K i was calculated fromK i = K i (app)/1 + [S]/K m , where [S] denotes substrate concentration. Slow binding inhibition was evaluated as described in Bienvenue et al. (16Bienvenue D.L. Bennet B. Holz R.C. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2000; 78: 43-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). L. amazonensis Lap (125 ng of protein) prewarmed to 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, pH 8, was added to a solution of apstatin (0–1.25 μm) or bestatin (0–50 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm MnCl2, 5 μm l-Leu-AMC, pH 8, and the reaction was monitored at 37 °C over 800 s. Progress curves that are obtained using this procedure can be described by the general integrated equation P =v s t + (v 0 −v s )(1 −e − kt )/k, where Prepresents the amount of product at time t,v 0 and v s represent the initial and final steady-state velocities, and k represents the apparent first-order rate constant for the establishment of the equilibrium between the initial (E·I) and mature (E·I*) enzyme-inhibitor complexes (17Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). Progress-curve data were fitted to this equation with SigmaPlot® (Jandel Scientific), permitting the determination of v 0 andv s . The overall inhibition constant,K i *, is described by the equationv s = V[S]/(K m (1 + [I]/K i *) + [S]), where V is the maximum velocity, K m and [S] are the Michaelis constant and the concentration of the substrate employed, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration (17Morrison J.F. Walsh C.T. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1988; 61: 201-301PubMed Google Scholar). The K i * was, thus, obtained from a secondary plot of v s versus [I]. Leishmania (1 × 109cells) were harvested by centrifugation (1 000 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), resuspended in 100 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm AEBSF, 10 μm E-64, and 10 μmpepstatin A, pH 8 (2 ml, 4 °C), sonicated on ice with a Branson Sonifer 250 sonicator (duty cycle = 20%, output = 2; 2 × 30 s), and centrifuged (15 000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to yield a crude soluble extract. Leishmania were evaluated for Lap secretion as described in Morty et al.(18Morty R.E. Lonsdale-Eccles J.D. Mentele R. Auerswald E.A. Coetzer T.H.T. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 2757-2761Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mid-log-phase promastigote L. amazonensis (5 × 107 cells/ml) were maintained in M199 medium described above. At 30-min intervals, aliquots (1 ml) were removed and centrifuged (1 500 × g, 2 min, 25 °C), and the Triton X-100 solubilized pellets and cell-free supernatants were tested for Lap activity against l-Leu-AMC. Polyclonal rabbit anti-porcine Lap (19Sankievicz D. Colepicolo P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) was from Pio Colepicolo (Universidade de São Paulo, Brasil). Polyclonal rabbit anti-Vibrio cholerae Lap (20Toma C. Honma Y. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4495-4500Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was from Claudia Toma (University of the Ryukyus, Japan). Antibodies were evaluated for Lap-neutralizing activity by preincubating Lap (2 nm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmMnCl2 containing 100 μg·ml−1 pre-immune or anti-Lap rabbit IgG (5 min, 37 °C) before the addition ofl-Leu-AMC. For Western blots, soluble Leishmania extracts (15 μg) or purified Lap (75 ng) were resolved on 12% reducing Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels (11Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10480) Google Scholar), transferred to Immobilon™-P (Millipore) membranes, blocked in 5% (m/v) nonfat milk in 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, and incubated with rabbit anti-porcine Lap serum (1:5000, 2 h). Blots were washed (3 × 5 min), incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Kirkegaard & Perry; 1:10,000, 30 min), washed again (1 × 30 min), and developed using the ECL™ system (AmershamBiosciences). For immunofluorescence, log-phase L. amazonensis were air-dried on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips, fixed with 3.8% (m/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (1 h, RT), permeabilized with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 in 2% (m/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (5 min), incubated with pre-immune or anti-porcine Lap rabbit sera (1:1000, 1 h), washed with 2% (m/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS (3 × 5 min), and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes; 1:2 000, 1 h). Coverslips were washed with 2% (m/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (1 × 30 min), mounted, and examined with an Axiovert 135 fluorescent microscope (Zeiss) at 100× magnification. Purified Leishmania Lap was dissolved in distilled, deionized H2O (10 mg·ml−1) and submitted to Huffman Laboratories, Inc. (Golden, CO) for determination of manganese and zinc by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Thelap genes isolated from Leishmania consisted of an ORF of 1698 base pairs, encoding polypeptides of 565 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 60 129.00, 60 041.30, and 60 274.10 Da for L. amazonensis, L. donovani, and L. major, respectively, with predicted pI values of 9.1–9.2. Nucleotide sequences have been deposited in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Base under accession numbers AF424691(L. major Lap), AF424692 (L. amazonensis Lap) andAF424693 (L. donovani Lap). Their encoded polypeptide chains contained a M17 Lap family signature sequence (21Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 183-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), and sequence alignments with other members of the M17 Laps indicate conservation of predicted catalytically important residues (Fig.1 A). The encoded Laps fromLeishmania shared significant (92–96%) identity to each other (Fig. 1 B); however, a phylogenetic comparison of the three full-length Leishmania Lap sequences with eight other M17 Laps indicated that the Leishmania enzymes were the most evolutionarily divergent members of this family, including homologues from prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (Fig. 1 B). TheE. coli and human Laps exhibit 30% identity, whereasL. amazonensis Lap exhibits 26 and 24% identity to E. coli and human Laps, respectively. Leishmania genomic DNA digested with endonucleases that do not cut within the lap ORF (Hind III,BglII, and SmaI) yielded single bands on a Southern blot when probed with full-length lap, whereas endonucleases that cut once within the lap ORF (AvaI, Pst I, XhoI, AccI) yielded two bands (Fig. 2). Thus,lap genes are present as a single copy perLeishmania genome. Messenger RNA for Leishmania lap was detected by RT-PCR in amastigote and log- and stationary-phase promastigotes (Fig.3 A). Similarly, Lap protein was detected by Western blot in amastigote and log- and stationary-phase promastigote L. amazonensis using antiserum raised against porcine Lap (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that lap genes are expressed at the translational and transcriptional level in all life-cycle stages ofLeishmania. The full-length Leishmania lap genes were expressed in E. coli as catalytically active (TableI), polyhistidine-tagged recombinant enzymes with a yield of 7–10 mg/liter of bacterial culture. The observed molecular mass of the recombinant Laps (±65 kDa; Fig.4) compared well with the calculated mass of the affinity-tagged translational products of the lapgenes (±62.5 kDa).Table IAmidolytic activity of Leishmania leucyl aminopeptidaseSubstrate1-aNo activity was observed against l-Lys-AMC, l-Val-AMC,l-Pro-AMC, l-His-AMC, l-Ser-AMC,l-Arg-AMC, l-Gly-AMC, l-Glu-AMC,l-Asn-AMC, l-Asp-AMC, l-Gln-AMC,l-Val-AMC, l-Tyr-AMC, and l-Thr AMC orN α-carbobenzyloxy(Cbz)-l-Leu-β-naphthylamide and Cbz-l-Gly-l-Gly-l-Leu-para-nitroanilide after 30 min.

No activity was eluted at an elution volume corresponding to 62 kDa (the molecular mass of the translation products of Leishmania lapgenes), although Lap monomers were detected in this fraction by Western blot (data not shown). These data may indicate that the translation product associates into catalytically competent homohexamers and suggests that Lap monomers may not be catalytically active.

Human sulfite oxidase expressed in E. coli moeA − could be activated in vitro in the presence of MoeA and low concentrations of molybdate.

The mechanism of molybdenum incorporation remains one of the more enigmatic aspects of Moco biosynthesis. It is known that themoeA, mogA, and modABC gene products are all required for this step. While the ModA-C proteins comprise the molybdate transport system (9Grunden A.M. Shanmugam K.T. Arch. Microbiol. 1997; 168: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the roles of MoeA and MogA have not been clearly delineated. Based on data showing partial recovery of nitrate reductase activity in an E. coli mogA−strain upon growth in high concentrations of Na2MoO4 (10Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the ability of purified MogA to bind MPT (11Liu M.T.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol.

Rajagopalan K.V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A recent finding that xanthine dehydrogenase activity in a Rhodobacter capsulatus moeA − mutant could be recovered upon growth with 1 mm Na2MoO4 indicated that MoeA is also involved in molybdenum incorporation (13Leimkühler S. Angermüller S. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5930-5939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results from our laboratory have confirmed that E. coli MoeA also binds MPT. 2J. Nichols and K. V. Rajagopalan, unpublished results. Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that fully functional human sulfite oxidase (SO) can be expressed in E. coli at high levels (14Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The data presented here show that SO expressed inmoeA − and mogA − cells contains normal levels of MPT, but is inactive due to a lack of molybdenum. This finding shows conclusively that bothmoeA − and mogA − cells synthesize MPT but are deficient in molybdenum incorporation. Additionally, MGD formation was found to be significantly reduced in these cell lines, indicating that molybdenum insertion is a prerequisite for nucleotide addition. An in vitro assay for MoeA function that monitors the MoO42−-dependent activation of heterologously expressed human SO in moeA −lysates is detailed, and conditions for optimal reconstitution are established. Parallel studies evaluating the ability of MogA to activate SO in mogA − lysates revealed that MogA was incapable of reconstituting SO activity, suggesting that the role of MogA in E. coli is distinct from that of MoeA.

His-tagged human SO (His-SO) was expressed inmoeA −, moeA +,mogA −, mogA +, andmoaA − cells containing pTG718 (Table I). Cells were grown at 37 °C (with the exception ofmogA − cells which were grown at 30 °C) aerobically overnight in a 5-ml culture of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This culture was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB/ampicillin, and His-SO was expressed aerobically at 30 °C in the presence of 50 μmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for ∼19 h. Cells were grown without supplemental Na2MoO4unless otherwise indicated. The cultures were harvested by centrifugation and washed once with water. The cell paste was resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, 300 mmNaCl, pH 8.0 (PN buffer) and lysed by three passages through a Microfluidics M110L Microfluidizer Processor. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. His-SO was purified in one step using a Ni-NTA-agarose affinity column (Qiagen) as described by Temple et al. (14Temple C.A. Graf T.N. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 383: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), and the purified SO was dialyzed into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The protein was quantitated spectrophotometrically at 413 nm using an extinction coefficient of 113,000 m−1 cm−1 (2.174 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1) (16Rajagopalan K.V. Coughlan M.P. Molybdenum and Molybdenum-Containing Enzymes. Pergamon, Oxford1980: 241-272Google Scholar). The activity of SO was assayed by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c at 550 nm as described previously (17Garrett R.M. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7387-7391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). One unit of SO activity is defined as an absorbance change of 1.0/min at 25 °C. His-tagged dimethyl sulfoxide reductase (His-DMSOR) was expressed inmoeA −, moeA +,mogA −, mogA +, andmobA − cells containing pJH820 (Table I) as described by Temple et al. (8Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was used at 10 μm for induction, and no supplemental Na2MoO4 was added to the cultures unless otherwise indicated. His-DMSOR was purified using the same procedure as for His-SO except that the enzyme was eluted from the resin with PN buffer containing 100 mm imidazole instead of 200 mm. His-DMSOR was quantitated using an extinction coefficient of 200,000 m−1 cm−1(2.3 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1) at 280 nm (18Hilton J.C. Rajagopalan K.V. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with one unit of activity defined as 1.0 μmol of Me2SO reduced per min at 25 °C. The MPT content of His-SO was quantitated by conversion to the fluorescent Form A (dephospho) derivative (20Johnson J.L. Rajagopalan K.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6856-6860Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) using 100 μg of His-SO in a total volume of 800 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The presence of dephospho-Form A was monitored using an Agilent 1100 Series fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength of 295 nm and emission at 448 nm. The MGD content of His-DMSOR was assayed by quantitation of Form A-GMP released by I2/KI treatment. A 1-ml aliquot of purified DMSOR in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, was acidified to pH 2.5 and oxidized with 50 μl of iodine solution at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. The sample was neutralized with 10% NaOH, and half was injected onto a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated with 150 mm ammonium acetate, 3% methanol. The second half of the sample was incubated overnight at room temperature with 0.05 unit of type III nucleotide pyrophosphatase (Sigma) and 4 μl of 2m MgCl2 and then chromatographed under the same conditions. To detect minute amounts of Form A-GMP, Form A-GMP was quantitated by measuring the increase in Form A fluorescence after pyrophosphatase treatment, since Form A is much more fluorescent than Form A-GMP. Molybdenum content was determined as described previously (19Hilton J.C. Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8428-8436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences Zeeman 3030 atomic absorption spectrometer. Cellular MPT and MGD levels were assayed by quantitating the amount of Form A and Form A-GMP produced from iodine-treated lysates. Washed cells (grown without a plasmid) were resuspended in 4 ml of H2O/g of cells, lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i., and centrifuged for 20 min at 20,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was oxidized as described previously (7Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and applied to a 20-ml QAE-Sephadex (Sigma) column. After washing with 50 ml of H2O, dephospho- and phospho-Form A were eluted using 700 ml of 15 mm HCl, and Form A-GMP was eluted with 80 ml of 50 mm HCl. Fractions containing dephospho- and phospho-Form A were adjusted to contain 100 mm Tris, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 m NaCl, pH 8.5, and 75 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) added. After overnight incubation, the sample was applied to a 10-ml QAE-Sephadex column. The column was washed with 30 ml of H2O, and dephospho-Form A was eluted with 40 ml of 10 mm acetic acid. Fractions containing Form A were pooled and quantitated as described (7Johnson J.L. Indermaur L.W. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12140-12145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Those fractions from the initial QAE column containing Form A-GMP were pooled, neutralized with NaOH, and rotoevaporated to dryness. After resuspension in 1 ml of H2O, the sample was injected onto a C-18 HPLC column equilibrated with 150 mm ammonium acetate, 3% methanol. Sample eluting between 22.5 and 30 ml was collected, rotoevaporated, and resuspended in 1 ml of 100 mm Tris, 15 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.5. The resuspended sample was divided, and each half was treated as described above for quantitation of MGD in purified His-DMSOR. SO and demolybdo-SO were expressed and purified from mobA − andmoeA − cells, respectively, containing pTG918 as described (8Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that demolybdo-SO was expressed in the absence of supplemental Na2MoO4. MPT was released from SO by anaerobic heat denaturation for 1 min at 100 °C. MobA and apo-DMSOR were expressed and purified frommobA − cells as described previously (8Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Formation of MGD and activated DMSOR was monitored as described (8Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) except that no alkaline phosphatase was added. His-SO was expressed in 1-liter cultures of moeA − ormogA − cells as described above without supplemental Na2MoO4. After washing, the cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 10 μg/ml DNase I. Cells were lysed by two passages through a French pressure cell at 16,000 p.s.i., and the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g for 20 min. The lysate, labeled (SO)lysate, was stored in aliquots at −80 °C. The concentration of SO in the lysate was determined spectrophotometrically as the amount of SO purified from a 1-ml aliquot using a 1-ml Ni-NTA column. Activation was carried out anaerobically in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. MoeA or MogA and Na2MoO4 in a total of 50 μl were added to 50 μl of (SO)lysate, incubated anaerobically at 37 °C for 60 min, then assayed for SO activity. His-SO was purified from aliquots of (SO)lysatee− (moeA −) and (SO)lysateg− (mogA −) by passing lysates over 1-ml Ni-NTA-agarose columns equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The SO-depleted lysates, labeled (ΔSO)lysate, were collected. After washing the column with 2 ml of PN buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, the SO was eluted with 2.5 ml of PN buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. The SO was exchanged into 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, using a PD10 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences), and concentrated to <300 μl using a Centricon 30 filtration device (Amicon). Protein concentrations were determined using the Pierce BCA assay with bovine serum albumin (Sigma) as a standard. Activation studies were carried out as described in the previous section and normalized for lysate protein concentration. It has previously been reported that growth at high concentrations of Na2MoO4 will partially activate endogenous nitrate reductase in E. coli mogA − cells (10Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and xanthine dehydrogenase inRhodobacter capsulatus moeA − cells (13Leimkühler S. Angermüller S. Schwarz G. Mendel R.R. Klipp W. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 5930-5939Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the activities of His-SO and His-DMSOR expressed inmoeA − and mogA − E. coli cells were not increased by the inclusion of Na2MoO4 in the growth media (TableII). Even at high MoO42−concentrations, the activities of both enzymes were very low, and their molybdenum content was <10% of that of proteins purified from wild type cells (data not shown).Table IIActivities of SO and DMSOR from moeA − and mogA − strainsSource[Na2MoO4] in growth mediumSODMSOR units/mg2-aActivity was assayed by monitoring reduction of cytochrome c. units/mg2-bActivity was assayed by monitoring reduction of Me2SO. moeA−09.670.0981 mm9.630.04710 mm11.320.061 moeA+080.817.31 mm541.120.3 mogA−00.730.1561 mm0.790.28810 mm3.750.266 mogA+072.513.71 mm424.820.82-a Activity was assayed by monitoring reduction of cytochrome c.2-b Activity was assayed by monitoring reduction of Me2SO. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the MPT content of His-SO purified from the mutant strains revealed that both the moeA − andmogA − strains produced His-SO containing MPT in the absence of MoO42− in the growth media (Fig.1). By comparison, His-SO purified from amoaA − strain, which has a mutation in the first step of cofactor biosynthesis, was devoid of MPT. The yield of Form A from mogA − His-SO was found to be higher than that from wild type His-SO. Since the yield of Form A from SO corresponds to ∼50% of the MPT content (21Johnson J.L. Hainline B.E. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5414-5422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the mode of binding of MPT to SO expressed in themogA − strain yields higher levels of Form A. Quantitation of MGD in His-DMSOR purified from the mutant strains showed a virtual absence of the dinucleotide form of the cofactor, 1–2% of the level in the wild type strain (TableIII).Table IIIMGD content of His-DMSOR from moeA − and mogA − strainsDMSOR source strainMGD3-aMGD was converted to the Form A-GMP derivative for analysis.

Open table in a new tab To examine the possibility that moeA − andmogA − cells can form MGD but cannot transfer it to MPT-free molybdoproteins, MPT and MGD levels in themoeA − and mogA − cell strains were quantitated and compared with those of wild type. As seen in Table IV, all strains exhibited comparable levels of MPT. However, neither themoeA − nor the mogA −strain showed detectable levels of MGD, thus explaining the absence of MGD in the His-DMSOR purified from these cells.Table IVMPT and MGD levels in various cell strainsStrainMPT4-aMPT was converted to Form A for quantitation.

Open table in a new tab The requirement of molybdenum insertion prior to conversion of MPT to MGD was further examined by monitoring the ability of purified E. coli MobA to convert MPT and MPT-Mo to MGD. MPT and MPT-Mo were obtained by heat denaturation of SO isolated from either themoeA − (SOe−) ormobA − (SOb−) strain, respectively (8Temple C.A. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40202-40210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The SOe− had no activity (<0.5 units/mgversus ∼700 units/mg for SOb−) and lacked detectable molybdenum, but had an MPT content equivalent to that of SOb−. The results in Fig. 2show that, while MPT-Mo from SOb− is a substrate for MobA and is readily converted to MGD, the MPT from SOe− is not. Additionally, it was observed that MPT from SOe− is ineffective as an MPT source for the activation of apo-DMSOR, even in the presence of 10 mm Na2MoO4 (data not shown). Previous experiments have shown that MPT synthesized in anin vitro system (4Leimkühler S. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1837-1844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) can be incorporated into MPT-free SO to yield active enzyme in the presence of high concentrations of Na2MoO4. To determine whether MoeA can facilitate molybdenum incorporation into MPT at physiological molybdenum concentrations, an in vitro system was developed to monitor the reconstitution of MPT-containing SO in amoeA − cell lysate. His-SO was expressed inmoeA − cells without Na2MoO4 supplementation, and assays were performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” In the absence of MoeA, only low levels of SO activity were observed (Fig.3 A). However, much greater reconstitution was obtained in the presence of exogenous MoeA even at low concentrations of molybdate. The maximum specific activity obtained in the presence of MoeA was about 20% of that of SO expressed inmoeA + cells supplemented with 1 mmNa2MoO4 (Table II). The addition of MoeA alone had no effect on SO activity in the absence of Na2MoO4. However, when varying amounts of MoeA were added to reaction mixtures containing 10 μmNa2MoO4, maximal activation was achieved at ∼2 μm MoeA (Fig. 3 B) with no inhibition of activation at MoeA levels as high as 56.8 μm. Activation was faster at 37 °C, with the maximal extent attained in 45 min (Fig. 3 C). To determine whether MogA could also effect MoO42−-dependent activation of SO, His-SO was expressed in the mogA − cell strain and the cell lysate prepared as for (SO)lysatee−. When the (SO)lysateg− was assayed for activation with varying ratios of Na2MoO4 and MogA, no significant increase in activation was observed (Fig.4). As shown in Fig.5 A, MogA was also incapable of activating SO expressed in moeA − cells, and MoeA was similarly unable to effect SO activation in (SO)lysateg−. The simultaneous addition of both MogA and MoeA to (SO)lysatee− had no appreciable effect on the level of SO activation observed with MoeA alone (Fig.5 A). While MoeA was able to activate SOe−in the presence of the SO-depleted mogA −lysate, (ΔSO)lysateg−, it could not activate SOg− in the presence of (ΔSO)lysatee−, and MogA was unable to activate SO under any condition (Fig.5 B). The partial activation of the mixture of SOe− and (ΔSO)lysateg− observed upon addition of MogA can be attributed to the presence of endogenous MoeA in the (ΔSO)lysateg−, since the addition of buffer alone results in the same extent of activation.Figure 5The function of MogA is required prior to activation of SO by MoeA. Assays contained 10 μmNa2MoO4, the equivalent of 50 μl of lysate (labeled at the top of each graph), purified SO to 31 μm where indicated, and either 5.7 μm MoeA (white), 5.7 μm MogA (gray), 5.7 μm MoeA + 5.7 μm MogA (hashed), or buffer (black). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Activation of purified SOe− by molybdate and MoeA in the presence and absence of lysate was investigated, and the results are presented in TableV. Addition of molybdenum alone resulted in negligible activation of the purified SOe− (data not shown). At 5.7 μm MoeA and 10 μmNa2MoO4, purified SOe− was activated to ∼5% of the level achieved in (SO)lysatee−. Increasing molybdenum concentrations to 10 mm resulted in activation to ∼17% of that seen with (SO)lysatee− (data not shown). When (ΔSO)lysatee− was added to the assay, the extent of activation was the same as was obtained with the complete (SO)lysatee− (Table V). Controls using purified SOa− (from moaA −) in place of SOe− and lysatee− (without expressed SO) in place of (SO)lysatee− showed no significant activation (data not shown). However, addition of lysatee− could effectively restore activation when included with SOe−(Table V), demonstrating that prior expression of SO in the lysate is not required.Table VSO activation by MoeA requires the protein fraction of lysateReaction mixture5-aIn addition to the listed lysate and SO components, all assays contained 10 μmNa2MoO4 and 5.7 μm MoeA in a 100-μl volume with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5.

Open table in a new tab To determine whether the effect of lysate on SO activation was dependent on the small molecules or another protein in the lysate, lysatee− was fractionated on a PD10 gel filtration column. Removal of the small molecule fraction from lysatee− did not decrease its ability to activate SOe− (Table V), indicating that the protein fraction of the lysate was required. The experiments described here were directed toward an understanding of the roles of MoeA and MogA in the biosynthesis of MPT and MGD and molybdenum incorporation into Moco. To this end, His-tagged human SO and Rhodobacter sphaeroides DMSOR were expressed and purified from moeA − andmogA − cells and analyzed for activity, molybdenum content, and MPT and MGD content, respectively. The data presented here conclusively show that while mutations in eithermoeA or mogA have no effect on MPT biosynthesis, they completely abolish the ligation of molybdenum to MPT. Although both moeA − and mogA −cellular extracts contain levels of MPT comparable with those of wild type cells, His-SO and His-DMSOR purified from either cell strain are inactive due to the absence of molybdenum (even when the cells are grown with high concentrations of molybdate). BothmoeA − and mogA − cells are devoid of MGD, the dinucleotide form of the cofactor required by DMSOR. In vitro examination of the MobA-catalyzed formation of MGD showed that no MGD is formed when SO purified frommoeA − cells was used as a pterin source. These observations clearly establish molybdenum ligation as a prerequisite for nucleotide addition. To further delineate the role of MoeA in Moco biosynthesis, a procedure was developed that monitors the MoO42−-dependent activation of SO in (SO)lysatee− by MoeA. Activation of SO by MoeA and molybdate was higher when the SOe− was present in the lysate than with the isolated protein. Isolated SOe− alone could be activated to a small extent, but addition of (ΔSO)lysatee− resulted in enhanced activation comparable with that observed with the original (SO)lysatee−. Results obtained using fractionated lysatee− indicated that the excluded fraction was sufficient for the increased activation, suggesting that the factor(s) supplied by the lysate was likely to be a macromolecule(s). However, the possibility of an essential small molecule bound to a protein in the high molecular weight fraction cannot be ruled out. Current studies are aimed at the identification and characterization of the factor(s) required for efficient activation. Based on the observations that nitrate reductase activity inmogA − cells can be partially rescued by growth on high concentrations of Na2MoO4 and the ability of MogA to bind MPT, it has been suggested that MogA acts as a molybdochelatase (10Stewart V. MacGregor C.H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 151: 788-799Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Liu M.T.W. Wuebbens M.M. Rajagopalan K.V. Schindelin H. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 4310-4312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inability of MogA to effect the MoO42−-dependent activation of SO expressed in mogA − cells is not consistent with this hypothesis. Our results have not defined a specific role for MogA; however, the data strongly suggest distinct, non-overlapping functions for MoeA and MogA, with MogA required in a step that precedes the MoeA-facilitated reaction. The presence of MogA also appears to be required for proper insertion of MPT into SO. The fact that SOg− could not be significantly activated by molybdate under any circumstances, despite containing MPT, suggests that an abnormality in some feature of the structure of MPT in SOg− precludes activation by molybdate. The function of MogA might be to bind MPT in the correct conformation during the molybdenum insertion step in vivo. The ability of MogA to bind MPT lends support to this hypothesis (11Liu M.T.W.

This report defines the first functional assay for the molybdenum insertion step of Moco biosynthesis and reveals a clear distinction between the functions of MoeA and MogA in this step. In vivo, apoenzymes are likely to be reconstituted by Moco rather than MPT, and MoeA may function to incorporate Mo onto MogA-bound MPT. The development of a MoO42−-dependent assay for MoeA provides the groundwork for further exploration into its role in molybdenum insertion. Current experiments are aimed at characterizing the factor(s) required for optimal MoeA-facilitated activation of His-SO using a more highly defined, lysate-free system. The data from these experiments should also help to more clearly define the function of MogA in molybdenum insertion."

Kinetic analyses of MMR processing in vitro have focused on base mismatches in a few sequence contexts, because of a lack of general and quantitative MMR assays and because of the difficulty of constructing a multiplicity of MMR substrates, particularly those with DNA lesions. We describe here simple and efficient construction of 11 different MMR substrates, by ligating synthetic oligomers into gapped plasmids generated using sequence-specific N.BstNBI nicking endonuclease, then using sequence-specific nicking endonuclease N.AlwI to introduce single nicks for initiation of 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ excision. To quantitatively assay MMR excision gaps in base-mispaired substrates, generated in human nuclear extracts lacking exogenous dNTPs, we used position- and strand-specific oligomer probes. Mispair-provoked excision along the shorter path from the pre-existing nick toward the mismatch, either 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′, predominated over longer path excision by roughly 10:1 to 20:1. MMR excision was complete within 7 min, was highly specific (90:1) for the nicked strand, and was strongly mispair-dependent (at least 40:1). Nonspecific (mismatch-independent) 5′ to 3′ excision was considerably greater than nonspecific 3′ to 5′ excision, especially at pre-existing gaps, but was not processive.

Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 50-52PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that MMR processing might correct photoproduct/base mispairs. Beyond such binding experiments, exogenous circular DNA substrates containing specific base mismatches and defined nicks for initiation of excision have been used to analyze MMR error corrections in mammalian cell-free extract (19Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 20Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These studies have yielded important mechanistic findings, including roles for MutL-homolog proteins, and for other MMR accessory proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and demonstration of MMR excision specificity. Error correction end-products have typically been assayed as restored restriction endonuclease recognition sites or reverted mutations in reporter genes (19Holmes J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 20Thomas D.C. Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3744-3751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such assays have not generally been possible with base mismatches in other sequence contexts, or with DNA lesion substrates, except in one special case where the lesion itself was removed by MMR (21Duckett D.R. Bronstein S.M. Taya Y. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12384-12388Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), which is not necessarily the biologically relevant response. It is difficult to prepare, in high yield and purity, a multiplicity of MMR substrates, particularly those with a single specific lesion in one strand and a defined single nick for initiation of excision in the other. Here we describe a simple procedure for preparation of MMR substrates and a general but precise MMR excision assay. We quantitatively analyzed the time courses of generation of excision gaps at specific positions in these MMR substrates in human nuclear extracts lacking exogenous dNTPs. Because of the low levels of adventitious nicks in these substrates, MMR excision was highly specific for mispaired versus homoduplex DNA, nickedversus continuous strands, and shorter versuslonger nick-mispair paths. We generated a variety of MMR substrates in high yield, by a new method: direct production of defined gaps in high copy number plasmids using a sequence-specific nicking enzyme, ligation of mismatch-creating synthetic oligomers into these gaps, and introduction of a defined nick using a second such enzyme. We used base-mismatched substrates and analyzed the end-products by restriction endonuclease assay as well, so that excision and error correction endpoints could be compared. However, the MMR excision assay procedures are applicable to DNA mismatches or lesions in any sequence context. All oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech (High Point, NC). T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and Pfu DNA polymerase was from CLONTECH. Endonucleases AseI,AhdI, and N.BstNBI were purchased from New England BioLabs, from whom N.AlwI endonuclease was a generous gift. Plasmid pUC19X was previously derived from pUC19 by removal of all GAGTC sequences (endonuclease N.BstNBI site, see Table I from Ref. 22Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The base pair corresponding to the first C:G base pair in the EarI site at position 2488 of the original pUC19 sequence is designated base pair 1 in pUC19X and in its derivative vectors described here (see Table I and Fig. 1 below). Nucleotides (nt) in the sense strands are designated 1, 2, … , and the complementary antisense strand nucleotides are designated 1′, 2′, … (sense and antisense strands are defined by the pUC19 bla gene). Plasmid pUC19X was further modified, by PCR-mediated site-specific mutagenesis employing Pfu DNA polymerase, so as to remove all GGATC sequences (endonuclease N.AlwI sites), changing those at nt 699, 769′, 785, 866′, 883, 1347, 1646′, and 1668 to GGACC, GCATC, GAATC, GGATG, GCATC, GGACC, GAATC, and GGACC, respectively. In the product plasmid pUC19Y, we replaced DNA between the uniqueAatII and SapI sites by a staggered heteroduplex with a single mismatch (in boldface) made by annealing antisense strand oligomer 1 (5′-CATCGAGTCCGATGCGGATATTAATGTGACGGTAGCGAGTCGCTCTTCC) to sense strand oligomer 2 (5′-AGCGGAAGAGCGACTCGCTACCGTCACATTGATATCCGCATCGGACTCGATGACGT). Two new plasmids, each with only two GAGTC sites (underlined), separated by 32 nt on the antisense strand, were created by subsequent segregation of the strands during plasmid replication. The plasmid with an endonuclease AseI recognition site in the inserted sequence was designated pUC19AseI; the other was designated pUC19AseIC to indicate the T:A to C:G base change in the AseI recognition sequence AT(T →C)AAT. Next, the blunt-end homoduplex formed by annealing antisense strand oligomer 3 (5′-CTCGAGCACTCGATCCAAGCTT) to sense strand oligomer 4 (5′-AAGCTTGGATCGAGTGCTCGAG) was inserted into the unique SspI sites of pUC19AseI and pUC19AseIC to create a unique endonuclease N.AlwI site (underlined) on the sense strand, yielding plasmids pUC19CPD and pUC19CPDC, respectively. Plasmid pUC19CPDRev was constructed by inserting a blunt-end homoduplex, formed by annealing antisense strand oligomer 5 (5′-CTCGAGGATCTCGTGCACAGCTT) to sense strand oligomer 6 (5′-AAGCTGTGCACGAGATCCTCGAG) into the SspI site of pUC19AseI, again providing a unique N.AlwI site (underlined) but instead on the antisense strand. All modified sequences were confirmed by direct sequencing, and by restriction digestion where one or more diagnostic sites were available.Table IPlasmids and derived DNA substratesName1-apUC19X, pUC19Y, pUC19AseI, pUC19AseIC, pUC19CPD, pUC19CPDC, and pUC19CPDRev designate plasmids propagated in baceria; sCPDgap, sCPDCgap, sCPDRevgap, sCPD(a/t), sCPDC(g/t), sCPDRev(a/c), sCPD(a/t)n, sCPDC(g/t)n, and sCPDRev(a/c)n designate DNA molecules derived by treatments described under “Experimental Procedures.”SizeNicking by endonuclease N.AlwI (coord.)1-bFirst base pair of theEarI site at 2488 in pUC19 and all derivatives described here are assigned coordinate 1.

Elbing K.L. Brent R. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocol in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1998: 1.76-1.78Google Scholar). Gapped plasmids were generated from the purified plasmids as previously described (24Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): nicking at the closely spaced N.BstNBI sites, removal of the oligonucleotides, and purification of gapped product by chromatography on benzoylated and napthoylated DEAE-cellulose. Previously, the yield of plasmid with 22-nt gaps was 30% of input DNA (24Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The yield here of plasmids with 32-nt gaps was 50%, presumably because of improved binding to benzoylated and napthoylated DEAE-cellulose by the larger gap. To construct substrates for MMR studies, we annealed a 10-fold excess of oligomer 7, 5′-GCGGATATTAATGTGACGGTAGCGAGTCGCTC, to 50 μg of gapped pUC19CPDC or pUC19CPD plasmid DNA, then purified the ligated product by isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl plus ethidium bromide as previously described (24Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The boldface thymine (nt 178′) thus created a G/T mismatch (substrate sCPDC(g/t)) or an A/T pair (substrate sCPD(a/t)). Similarly, a 10-fold excess of oligomer 8, 5′-GCGGATATCAATGTGACGGTAGCGAGTCGCTC, was ligated to gapped pUC19CPDRev, so the boldface cytosine (nt 179′) created an A/C mismatch (substrate sCPDRev(a/c)).

We constructed nine other substrates using oligomers similar to oligomer 7 but with one or two changes (the 5th through 17th base pairs are shown in Table II (lines 2–10; see footnote), which were ligated into gapped pUC19CPDC and processed as described above.Table IIExcision analyses of mismatched-DNA substratesExcision assay was performed by incubating 100 μg of HeLa nuclear extract with 100 ng of indicated substrate without exogenous dNTPs for 7 min at 37 °C.

Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLaS3 cells (purchased from the National Cell Culture Center, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (22Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Standard MMR mixtures (15 μl) contained 75 fmol (100 ng) of sCPDC(g/t)n or sCPDRev(a/c)n substrate, 100 μg of nuclear extract, and 750 ng of bovine serum albumin, plus the following components at the indicated concentrations: 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6; 1.5 mm ATP; 1 mm glutathione; 0.1 mmfor each of four dNTPs; 5 mm MgCl2; and 110 mm KCl. Mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were terminated by the addition of 30 μl of Stop solution (25 mm EDTA, 0.67% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 90 μg/ml proteinase K). After further incubation of mixture at 37 °C for 15 min, DNA was extracted twice with an equal volume of phenol and precipitated with ethanol. DNA was resuspended in H2O and digested with 4 units ofAseI endonuclease and 1 μg of RNase A at 37 °C for 2 h in 15 μl of AseI digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9; 100 mm NaCl; 10 mm MgCl2; and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)). The digested products were separated by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gel in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, 2 mm EDTA). Correction of (G/T) or (A/C) mismatches to (A/T) restores a second site for AseI endonuclease, which thus cuts the products into 0.8- and 1.2-kb fragments. DNA bands were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide then imaged with UVP ImageStore7500 and analyzed using ImageQuaNT software. The repair yield equals the ratio of the summed intensities of the 0.8- and 1.2-kb fragments to the total of this sum plus the intensity of the 2.0-kb band corresponding to singly cut (uncorrected) DNA. To freeze excision gaps generated during MMR, exogenous dNTPs were omitted from a standard reaction mixture containing nicked mismatched DNA substrate or various control substrates. Incubation was at 37 °C for 7 min, unless otherwise indicated. DNA was extracted and precipitated as described under “MMR Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts” and digested at 37 °C for 2 h with 4 units of AhdI endonuclease plus 1 μg of RNase A in 15 μl of AhdI digestion buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.9; 50 mm potassium acetate; 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mmDTT). After 0.5 pmol of a particular 32P-labeled oligomer probe (Table III) was added, the mixture was incubated at 85 °C for 5 min then slowly cooled down to room temperature. Annealed products were separated from free oligomers by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels in 1× TAE buffer. After DNA bands from agarose gels were measured quantitatively, as described under “MMR Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts,” the gels were dried and the radioactivity in each sample was measured by phosphorimaging. Measurements of DNA bands from agarose gels were used to normalize radioactivity measurements for any variations in DNA recovery and loading.Table IIIRelative excision signals and estimated yield of excised intermediateProbe3-aSequences of probes:A, 5′-gagcgactcgctaccgtcacattaatatccgc; B, 5′-cttttcggggaaatgtgcgcggaaccccta; C, 5′-atgtatccgctcatgagacaataaccctga; D, 5′-gcggatatcaatgtgacggtagcgagtcgctc; D′, 5′-gcggatattaatgtgacggtagcgagtcgctc; E, 5′-gatcaaagaatcttcttgagatgctttttttctg; F, 5′-attcaacatttccgtgtcgcccttattccc; G, 5′-ctcggtcgttcggctgcggcgagcggtatc; H, caaataggggttccgcgcacatttccccga; J, 5′-tcagggttattgtctcatgagcggatacat; K, 5′-gggcgacacggaaatgttgaatactcatac.Coordinates3-bRefer to Fig. 1; unprimed coordinates are collinear with the sense strand of the blagene.sCPDC(g/t)n3-cCoordinates: nick 23, mismatch 178.sCPD(a/t)n3-cCoordinates: nick 23, mismatch 178.sCPDC(g/t)3-fNo strand interruptions.sCPDgapsCPDRev(a/c)n3-gCoordinates: nick, 30′; mismatch, 179′.Gap signal3-dRelative to the amount of radiolabeled probe C bound to product; determined by annealing and electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).Product yield3-eEstimated by assuming thatprobe C detects 40% of input DNA.Gap signal3-dRelative to the amount of radiolabeled probe C bound to product; determined by annealing and electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).Product yieldGap signal3-dRelative to the amount of radiolabeled probe C bound to product; determined by annealing and electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).Product yieldGap signal3-dRelative to the amount of radiolabeled probe C bound to product; determined by annealing and electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).Product yieldGap signal3-hRelative to the amount ofprobe I bound to product.Product yield % % % % % A170–2010.90360.0420.042 B114–1530.97390.052 C55–84(1.00)400.052 D170′ –201′0.0310.062 D′170′ –201′0.021 E953–9860.0420.021 F1966–19951.25500.4016 G109′ –138′0.083 H232′ –261′2.4096 I (D′)171′ –202′1.0635 J55′ –84′(1.00)33 K1975′ –1′0.166Table shows results of incubation of 75 fmol of the indicated DNA substrates with 100 μg of nuclear extract in 15 μl of MMR mixtures lacking exogenous dNTPs (or in scaled-up reactions, if several probes were used for a single substrate) for 7 min at 37 °C, extraction and precipitation of DNA, and gap analysis with indicated probes, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Signals for probes fromA to G are shown relative to signal fromprobe C with substrate sCPDC(g/t)n, and signals forprobes I, J, and K relative to the signal for probe I with substrate sCPDRev(a/c)n.3-a Sequences of probes:A, 5′-gagcgactcgctaccgtcacattaatatccgc; B, 5′-cttttcggggaaatgtgcgcggaaccccta; C, 5′-atgtatccgctcatgagacaataaccctga; D, 5′-gcggatatcaatgtgacggtagcgagtcgctc; D′, 5′-gcggatattaatgtgacggtagcgagtcgctc; E, 5′-gatcaaagaatcttcttgagatgctttttttctg; F, 5′-attcaacatttccgtgtcgcccttattccc; G, 5′-ctcggtcgttcggctgcggcgagcggtatc; H, caaataggggttccgcgcacatttccccga; J, 5′-tcagggttattgtctcatgagcggatacat; K, 5′-gggcgacacggaaatgttgaatactcatac.3-b Refer to Fig. 1; unprimed coordinates are collinear with the sense strand of the blagene.3-c Coordinates: nick 23, mismatch 178.3-d Relative to the amount of radiolabeled probe C bound to product; determined by annealing and electrophoresis (see “Experimental Procedures”).3-e Estimated by assuming thatprobe C detects 40% of input DNA.3-f No strand interruptions.3-g Coordinates: nick, 30′; mismatch, 179′.3-h Relative to the amount ofprobe I bound to product.

To test their ability to be converted into corrected products, putative gapped intermediates were generated and purified as above (before treatment with RNase A and AhdI endonuclease) and incubated with 2 units of DNA pol I Klenow fragment (Invitrogen) plus all four dNTPs (17 μm each) in 15 μl of AseI digestion buffer (see above) for 20 min at room temperature. The gap-filling reaction was terminated by heating at 85 °C for 20 min; after cooling, 4 units of AseI endonuclease and 1 μg of RNase A were added to the mixture and the incubation continued at 37 °C for 2 h. Digestion products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and analyzed as described under “MMR Reactions in HeLa Nuclear Extracts”; product yields were compared with those obtained from identical HeLa extract MMR reactions using standard reaction conditions. Plasmids pUC19CPD, pUC19CPDC, and pUC19CPDRev (Table I), which all contain two tandem sites for the sequence-specific nicking endonuclease N.BstNBI, separated by 32 nt on the antisense strand, were used to produce gaps into which mismatch-creating oligomers were ligated (Tables I and II). Nicking at respective sites for a recently described second such enzyme, endonuclease N.AlwI (25Xu Y. Lunnen K.D. Kong H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12990-12995Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), provides points for initiation of 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′ MMR excision along the shorter paths toward the mismatches (Table I and Fig.1). Beginning with 400 μg of plasmid DNA, we routinely obtain 200 μg of gapped plasmid. Typically, ligation of 50 μg of gapped plasmid with excess oligomer yields 20–25 μg of purified product. In substrate sCPDC(g/t)n, 3′ to 5′ excision of the sense strand along the shorter nick-mispair path removes the guanine nucleotide at nt 178, and DNA resynthesis restores a recognition site for endonuclease AseI. In substrate sCPDRev(a/c)n, 5′ to 3′ excision of the antisense strand removes the cytosine at nt 179, and resynthesis again restores the AseI site. We compared time courses of MMR error correction and excision in HeLa extracts, with or without exogenous dNTPs. The substrate sCPDC(g/t)n contains a G/T mispair at bp 178/178′, and a nick 3′ to the G, at nt 23 (Table I). In repeated experiments, yields of corrected product, now cleavable by AseI endonuclease at both bp 178 and 1381, reached plateau levels of 30–45% of input substrates after 8–10 min (Fig. 2, A and D,open circles). Product yields remained constant for up to 30 min (data not shown). MMR excision, assayed as the appearance of single-strand DNA bound by radiolabeled probe A and collinear with the nicked strand at nt 170–201 (Table III and Fig. 1), preceded error correction by 50 s at half-maximal y"

Both Pittsburgh mutant of α1-proteinase inhibitor and dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, two specific furin inhibitors, blocked the activation of hADAM19. Activation of hADAM19 was also blocked by brefeldin A, which inhibits protein trafficking from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, or A23187, a calcium ionophore known to inhibit the autoactivation of furin.

Furthermore, only pro-forms of hADAM19 were detected in the 199RR to AA mutant, which abolished both furin recognition sites. Moreover, the zymogens were not converted into their active forms in two furin-deficient mammalian cell lines; co-expression of hADAM19 and furin in these two cell lines restored zymogen activation.

As a major proprotein convertase, furin is concentrated in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and cycles between this compartment and the cell surface through the endocytic pathway.

However, the molecular mechanism and pathway by which the cells regulate the potentially important interactions between these proenzymes and the proprotein convertase in cells are not fully understood. In this report, we present evidence that furin is responsible for the activation of hADAM19 and this activation can occur via one of the two consecutive recognition sites and that furin is co-localized with the substrate in the ER-Golgi complex and/or TGN.DISCUSSIONProteolysis of the extracellular matrix and cell surface proteins mediated by metalloproteases, including MMPs and ADAMs, is of vital importance for tissue-remodeling processes during normal and pathological conditions, such as tissue morphogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (3Schlondorff J.

Metalloproteases are synthesized as inactive proenzymes or zymogens, and their latency is maintained by a cysteine-switch residue in the propeptide domain in which the thiol group is coordinated to the active site zinc (II) (2Stone A.L.

To display any proteolytic activities, the prodomain located N-terminal to the catalytic domain must be removed from the zymogen in most cases. Recently, PCs, such as furin and or furin-like serine peptidases, have been recognized as very important enzymes for the zymogen activation, although various mechanisms have been proposed for the activation of pro-MMPs and pro-ADAMs. Furin or furin-like PCs mediate zymogen activation by recognizing a conserved RX(K/R)R motif in the boundary between pro- and catalytic domains. This motif is present in almost all ADAMs and nine MMPs (2Stone A.L. Kroeger M. Sang Q.X. J. Protein Chem. 1999; 18: 447-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,13Primakoff P. Myles D.G.

By analyzing the intracellular activation of hADAM19, we have demonstrated that both furin activity and one of the two consecutive sites in197RPRRMK203Rin ADAM19 are required for activation, which is dependent on calcium and proper secretory pathway trafficking. Furthermore, we have provided direct evidence that furin is co-localized with hADAM19 in ER-Golgi complex and/or TGN. This colocalization between furin and hADAM19 is independent of the furin recognition site and is resistant to a variety of treatments, such as CMK, BFA, and A23187, that inhibit furin activity, vesicular trafficking, and calcium signal, respectively. These findings are consistent with the report published recently showing that furin was co-localized with MMP16 independent of their apparent enzyme-substrate relationship (40Kang T. Nagase H. Pei D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 675-681PubMed Google Scholar).Latency and Activation of ADAMsThe classic cysteine switch mechanism for pro-MMP latency and activation was originally proposed for MMPs (10Van Wart H.E. Birkedal-Hansen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The activation of pro-MMP-3 by a mercurial compound was triggered by a perturbation of the conformation of the precursor rather than a direct disruption of the Cys-zinc interaction (54Chen L.C. Noelken M.E. Nagase H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10289-10295Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A salt bridge in pro-MMP-3 might also contribute to the latency of the proenzyme (55Galazka G. Windsor L.J. Birkedal-Hansen H. Engler J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11221-11227Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Organomercurial treatment failed to activate pro-MMP-26 with a unique cysteine-switch motif, PH81 CGXXD, and when the conserved cysteine-switch sequence, PR81 CGXXD, in the prodomain of pro-MMP-26 was restored by mutagenesis, the cysteine-switch activation mechanism was not induced (58Marchenko N.D.

However, for many ADAMs, including ADAM19, no direct evidence has been provided to support the hypothesis that the Cys-zinc coordination is required for latency. For ADAM17/tumor necrosis factor-α convertase, the prodomain was not only an inhibitor of the catalytic domain, but also appeared to act like a chaperone, facilitating secretion, folding, or both of the ADAM protein (12Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B., Su, J. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R.

In this report, we have demonstrated that, after the removal of the prodomain of hADAM19 by furin, the enzyme has endopeptidase activity against α2-M. However, furin is unable to cleave the prodomain of the 199RR to AA hADAM19 mutant lacking a furin recognition site in the boundary of the pro- and catalytic domains. This mutant has no proteolytic activity using an α2-M trapping assay. These results demonstrate that at least one of the furin recognition sites is required for the removal of the propeptide domain by furin to activate pro-hADAM19. The detailed mechanism of pro-ADAM19 latency and activation and the role of the cysteine-switch sequence remain to be further investigated.For the activation of ADAM zymogens, two mechanisms have been reported. One is the removal of the prodomain by autolysis, but it was shown only in ADAM28 (60Howard L. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The predominant mechanism for the activation of ADAMs is mediated by furin or furin-like PCs in the secretory pathway. This mechanism has been shown in many ADAMs, including ADAM1, -9, -12, -15, -17, and -19, and ADAMTS1, -4, and -12, using N-terminal sequencing, specific inhibitors of furin, blockers of protein trafficking from ER to Golgi, exogenous soluble furin in vitro, furin-deficient cell lines, and mutagenesis at the furin recognition site(s) (RX(K/R)R) between the pro- and catalytic domain (Refs. 16Cal S.

We show here that the DNA binding domain (DBD) is sufficient to account for the selective influence of HMGB-1/-2 on the steroid class of receptors. Furthermore, the use of chimeric DBDs reveals that this selectivity is dependent on the C-terminal extension (CTE), amino acid sequences adjacent to the zinc finger core DBD. HMGB-1/-2 interact directly with the DBDs of steroid but not class II receptors, and this interaction requires the CTE. Thisin vitro interaction correlates with a requirement of the CTE for maximal HMGB-1/-2 enhancement of DNA binding in vitro and transcriptional activation in cells. Finally, class II receptor DBDs have a much higher intrinsic affinity for DNA than steroid receptor DBDs, and this affinity difference is also dependent on the CTE. These results reveal the importance of the steroid receptor CTE for DNA binding affinity and functional response to HMGB-1/-2.

This superfamily consists of three receptor subclasses: 1) the steroid hormone receptors for progesterone (PR)1, estrogen (ER), glucocorticoids (GR), androgens (AR), and mineralocorticoids (MR); 2) class II receptors for thyroid hormone (TR), retinoids (RAR and RXR), vitamin D3 (VDR), prostaglandins (PPAR), oxysterols, and bile acids; and 3) orphan receptors for which no endogenous ligand has been identified (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Each of the receptor subclasses is characterized by a unique mechanism of action with respect to dimerization and DNA sequence recognition. Steroid receptors form homodimers that optimally recognize hexameric DNA elements arranged as inverted repeats separated by three unspecified base pairs. PR, GR, AR, and MR bind to the core hexamer AGAACA, whereas ER recognizes AGGTCA (2Beato M. Klug J. Hum. Reprod. Update. 2000; 6: 225-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Class II receptors preferentially function as heterodimers with RXR and recognize the AGGTCA hexamer arranged as direct repeats. Variable spacing between the direct repeats determines the RXR heterodimer binding specificity. Class II receptors, particularly TR, can also recognize an inverted repeat as homodimers, or half-sites as monomers. Orphan receptors can bind to the AGGTCA hexamer arranged either as a direct repeat, palindrome, or half-site as heterodimers with RXR, homodimers, or monomers (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

However, not all sequence-specific transcription factors are influenced by HMGB-1/-2.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2769-2781Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Additionally, we and others have shown that both HMGB-1/-2 enhance DNA binding and transcriptional activity of the steroid hormone subclass of nuclear receptors while not affecting these functions of class II receptors, including RAR, VDR, or RXR (18Boonyaratanakornkit V.

Helix1 makes base-specific contacts in the major groove, while helix2 maintains the overall structural fold of the core DBD (32Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustaffson J.-A. Mol.

Both biochemical and structural analyses of the nuclear receptor DBDs have shown that this domain is highly conserved across all nuclear receptors. In addition to the core DBD, sequences located immediately C-terminal to the second zinc finger, termed the C-terminal extension (CTE), directly participate in DNA binding by the class II and orphan receptors. Unlike the core DBD, CTE sequences are not conserved among nuclear receptors, and the CTE adopts different structural motifs (39Khorasanizadeh S. Rastinejad F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 384-390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, these divergent structures share a common function to extend the protein-DNA interface beyond that of base-specific contacts in the major groove thus stabilizing DNA binding. Crystallization of a TRβ-RXRα DBD heterodimer bound to a direct repeat element demonstrated that the TRβ CTE forms an additional α-helix (helix3) distinct from the core DBD that projects across the minor groove of the DNA helix making contacts along the phosphate backbone (34Rastinejad F. Perlman T. Evans R. Sigler P. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). NMR analysis of the RXR DBD in solution also revealed a third α-helix in the CTE (33Lee M.S. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Wright P.E. Evans R.M. Science. 1993; 260: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). However, the crystal structure of the RXR DBD-DNA complex had a CTE with an extended structure, suggesting that the RXR CTE undergoes a conformational change upon binding to DNA (37Rastinejad F. Wagner T. Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 38Zhao Q. Chasse S.A. Devarakonda S. Sierk M.L. Ahvazi B. Rastinejad F. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 509-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The orphan receptor CTE contains a short, conserved amino acid sequence, termed the “GRIP-box”, with the consensus RXGRZP, where “X” is any amino acid and “Z” is a hydrophobic residue. Structural analysis of orphan receptor DBDs bound to DNA as either a homodimer (RevErb, (40Zhao Q. Khorasanizadeh S. Miyoshi Y. Lazar M.A. Rastinejad F. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar)) or monomer (NGFI-B, (36Meinke G. Sigler P.B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)), revealed the CTE lying along the minor groove of DNA in an extended conformation distinct from that observed in either of the class II receptor DBDs. This GRIP-box creates an additional protein-DNA interface beyond that of the core DBD that interacts with specific base pairs. In the absence of DNA the orphan receptor CTE is unstructured suggesting that it also undergoes a conformational change upon association with DNA (35Sem D.S. Casimiro D.R. Kliewer S.A. Provencal J. Evans R.M. Wright P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18038-18043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Biochemical analysis has also demonstrated the importance of the CTE for high affinity DNA binding because point mutations or truncation of the class II and orphan receptor CTEs reduces or abolishes DNA binding (33Lee M.S.

These results taken together suggest that the class II and orphan nuclear receptors have a bipartite DBD consisting of the core DBD that makes base-specific contacts with core hormone response elements (HREs) and the CTE that provides additional, largely nonspecific DNA contacts that stabilize the protein-DNA complex.There is no structural evidence for the existence of an equivalent CTE in the steroid class of nuclear receptors. Structural studies of the ERα and GR DBDs complexed to DNA and in solution either lacked the comparable length CTE sequences in the expressed DBD constructs or the CTE was unstructured (32Zilliacus J. Wright A.P.H. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustaffson J.-A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aside from an earlier report that sequences C-terminal to the core ERα DBD are important for DNA binding stability (47Mader S. Chambon P. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), no other biochemical data are available to suggest that the CTE of steroid receptors directly participates in DNA binding as it does with other nuclear receptors.Here, we determine the mechanistic basis for the selective influence of HMGB-1/-2 on the steroid subclass of nuclear receptors. Through biochemical analysis of purified DBDs, we show that HMGB-1/-2 selectively influence DNA binding by the DBDs for steroid but not class II receptors. By use of chimeric DBDs, in which the CTE was swapped between steroid and class II receptors, we demonstrate that the CTE is responsible for the differential influence of HMGB-1/-2 on the two classes of nuclear receptors. Furthermore, class II receptor DBDs exhibited a much higher intrinsic affinity for their target DNAs than the steroid receptor DBDs, a difference also attributed to the CTE. Finally, we show that the CTE of steroid receptors is required for direct interaction with HMGB-1/-2 and for maximal HMGB-1/-2-enhanced DNA binding in vitro and transcriptional activation in cells. These results demonstrate that the CTE of steroid receptors plays a role in DNA binding but acts differently than class II DBDs by a mechanism that involves interaction with HMGB-1/-2.DISCUSSIONThe present study reveals that the CTE of steroid receptors plays a role in DNA binding but acts by a distinct mechanism from class II nuclear receptors. By use of chimeric DBDs and truncation mutants, we demonstrate that the CTE is responsible for the differential ability of HMGB-1/-2 to selectively increase the DNA binding affinity of steroid receptor DBDs and is required for a direct protein interaction between steroid receptors and HMGB-1/-2 that does not occur with class II nuclear receptors. We also show that the CTE is responsible for a higher intrinsic DNA binding affinity of class II DBDs. These results taken together demonstrate that the CTE of steroid receptors is a site required for interaction with HMGB-1/-2 and for maximal enhancement of steroid receptor-DNA binding and transactivation by HMGB-1/-2.No other study to our knowledge has directly compared the apparent binding affinities of different classes of nuclear receptor DBDs under the same conditions. This comparison demonstrates that the class II receptor DBDs have a substantially higher intrinsic DNA binding affinity than the steroid receptor DBDs, particularly the PR and GR DBDs (Table I), suggesting fundamental differences in the way the DBDs of these two nuclear receptor subclasses interact with DNA. Fusing the TRβ CTE to the PR core DBD increased the affinity of the PR DBD for PREs 6-fold, whereas fusing the PR CTE to the core TR DBD resulted in a 13–30-fold reduction in the affinity of the TRβ DBD for its target DNA (Fig. 5 and Table I). These CTE domain swapping experiments indicate that the observed affinity differences between the steroid and class II receptor DBDs are largely attributable to the CTE.The ERα DBD appears to be unique among the steroid receptor DBDs, because it bound to DNA with a higher apparent affinity than the other steroid receptor DBDs analyzed (Table I). ERα recognizes the core DNA hexamer AGGTCA, a sequence bound by the majority of the nuclear receptor superfamily with the exception of the GR subgroup of steroid receptors, including PR, GR, MR, and AR, which all bind to AGAACA. Comparison of the GR and ERα DBD-DNA crystal structures demonstrates that ERα makes more direct and water-mediated DNA contacts in the major groove than does GR, a possible mechanism for the observed affinity differences. Additionally, the ERα CTE (aa 261–264) contains a sequence motif similar to the GRIP-box sequence in the orphan receptor SF-1. The GRIP-box forms an extended structure that interacts in the minor groove flanking HREs and is important for stability of orphan receptor-DNA interaction. Other steroid receptor CTEs, such as those in PR or ERβ, do not contain a similar GRIP-box-like sequence. If the ERα CTE contains a bona fide GRIP-box this could account for the affinity differences observed between the ERα DBD and other steroid receptor DBDs. Nonetheless, the ERα DBD behaved like other steroid receptors in that HMGB-1/-2 increased its DNA binding affinity 7-fold (Table I). It is of interest to note that the DNA binding affinity of ERα DBD in the presence of HMGB-1/-2 is higher than the intrinsic affinities of the class II DBDs (Table I) further illustrating that ERα has some unique properties that do not fit with the steroid or class II receptor classifications.Whereas the steroid receptor DBDs have a low relative DNA binding affinity, addition of HMGB-1/-2 enhanced this affinity 7–9-fold, such that the K d app approached that of the class II receptor DBDs. In contrast, HMGB-2 had no effect on DNA binding by RXRα or TRβ DBDs (Figs. 3 and 4, and Table I). This selective interaction with the steroid receptor DBDs is not dependent on the DNA target element because HMGB-1/-2 enhanced PR DBD binding to both inverted repeat and half-site elements (Fig. 3) (20Senkus Melvin V. Edwards D.P. Steroids. 1999; 64: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) but did not affect binding by the TRβ DBD to either direct or inverted repeat elements (Table I). These results suggest that a feature of steroid receptor DBDs and not the target DNA is the important determinant for the selective influence of HMGB-1/-2. Indeed, we show that the DBD of steroid receptors mediates a protein interaction with HMGB-1/-2 that was not detected with class II receptor DBDs (Fig. 6). That HMGB-1/-2 interaction with the steroid receptors is mediated through the DBD is not entirely surprising since HMGB-1/-2 interaction with the OCT and HOX transcription factors, is also mediated by the DBD (25Zwilling S. Konig H. Wirth T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1198-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Citterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). A correlation was observed between the ability of HMGB-1/-2 to stimulate receptor activity and to make a direct contact with the receptor. HMGB-1/-2 directly interacted with the steroid receptors (PR and ER) and stimulated both DNA binding and transactivation by these receptors. The class II receptors (TRβ and RXRα) did not interact with HMGB-1/-2, nor did they respond functionally to HMGB-1/-2 (18Boonyaratanakornkit V. Senkus Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) (Fig.6). This correlation highlights the importance of protein-protein interactions in HMGB-1/-2 stimulation of steroid receptor activity and is consistent with previous observations that HMGB-1/-2 selectively increased DNA binding and transactivation by full-length steroid receptors but not class II receptors (18Boonyaratanakornkit V. Senkus Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4471-4487Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 20Senkus Melvin V. Edwards D.P. Steroids. 1999; 64: 576-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 26Zappavigna V. Falciola L. Citterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).HMGB-1/-2 interaction with the steroid receptor DBD was dependent on the CTE, since truncation of the CTE resulted in a loss of detectable protein interaction (Fig. 6). Whether the CTE is a binding site for HMGB-1/-2 or confers a conformation on the DBD that is required for interaction remains to be determined. Truncation of the CTE also resulted in a significant reduction in HMGB-1/-2 enhancement of PR DBD-DNA binding (Table I). Likewise, the chimeric PR construct, which contained the TRβ CTE in place of its own CTE, also exhibited a substantial reduction in HMGB-1/-2 stimulation of PR-mediated transactivation in cells (Fig. 7). Thus, we also observed a correlation between the requirement of the CTE for physical association with HMGB-1/-2 and the ability of HMGB-1/-2 to stimulate PR DNA bindingin vitro and PR-mediated transactivation in situ. However, some residual stimulatory activity of HMGB-1/-2 in the absence of the PR CTE was still observed in DNA binding and transfection assays suggesting that physical interaction with the CTE does not account for all the HMGB-1/-2 effects on PR activity. The mechanism for this residual HMGB-1/-2 activity in the absence of the CTE is not known but may be explained by interaction of HMGB-1/-2 with DNA or a weak interaction between HMGB-1/-2 and the core DBD that is not detectable under our assay conditions.The CTEs of class II and orphan receptors have clearly been shown to play an important role in DNA binding through extension and stabilization of protein-DNA contacts through interactions with DNA in the minor groove. Only a few reports exist to support a similar role in DNA binding of the steroid receptor CTE. Truncations of the ERα CTE led to an acceleration of the off-rate of the ER DBD from DNA and an increased sensitivity to the ionic strength of EMSA buffers (47Mader S. Chambon P. White J.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1125-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) suggesting a role of the CTE in stability of the ER-DNA complex. Additionally, truncation of the GR and AR CTEs to a length shorter than twelve amino acids reduced the DNA binding affinity (59Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Classens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In the same study, the CTE and the second zinc finger of AR were also required for AR recognition of a direct repeat androgen response element; a function attributed to the different dimerization mode required to bind to the direct versus inverted repeat (59Schoenmakers E. Alen P. Verrijdt G. Peeters B. Verhoeven G. Rombauts W. Classens F. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar).The present results support a model whereby HMGB-1/-2 selectively interact with steroid receptors through a direct protein interaction with the DBD that is dependent on the CTE and that this interaction somehow increases the DNA-binding affinity of the receptor. The mechanism by which HMGB-1/-2 interaction enhances steroid receptor-DNA binding remains to be determined. One possibility is that the HMGB-1/-2 recruited by steroid receptors stabilizes the receptor-DNA complex by extending the protein-DNA interface thus substituting for the CTE of other nuclear receptors. However, the existence of a stable ternary DBD/HMGB/DNA complex is questionable since it is very difficult to capture HMGB-1/-2 in the final high affinity PR-DNA complex suggesting that HMGB-1/-2 interaction is transient (18Boonyaratanakornkit V. Senkus Melvin V. Prendergast P. Altmann M. Ronfani L. Bianchi M.E. Taraseviciene L. Nordeen S.K. Allegretto E.A. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell.

The signaling adapters ShcB and ShcC, but not ShcA, are thought to be the primary Shc adaptor proteins in neurons as both are highly expressed in both the developing and adult nervous system.

Neurotrophins act on two types of cell surface receptors: high affinity tyrosine kinase Trk receptors (including TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) and the low affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. Trk receptors play a crucial role in neuronal survival and differentiation, whereas p75NTR facilitates ligand binding to the Trk receptors and is a regulator of cell death (3Barbacid M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 148-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). TrkA is a receptor for NGF and neurotrophin-6 (NT-6); TrkB is a receptor for BDNF and NT4/5; TrkC is the primary receptor for NT-3 (6Barbacid M. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1386-1403Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). No interactions between NGF and TrkB or BDNF/NT-4/5 and TrkA are observed. The p75NTR binds all known neurotrophins with similar equilibrium binding kinetics (7Bothwell M. Science. 1996; 272: 506-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Through Trk receptors, neurotrophins stimulate a variety of cellular responses including survival, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis, in different cell types, by pathways that involve the activation of Ras, Rap1, Raf, MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), Src, CHK, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase).

In the intracellular domain (ICD) of the Trk receptors, there are five tyrosine sites that are phosphorylated by ligand binding, i.e. Tyr499, Tyr679, Tyr683, Tyr684, and Tyr794 in rat TrkA (14Meakin S.O.

Neurosci. 1996; 7: 371-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Trk receptors phosphorylate and activate signaling proteins through the recruitment of proteins to these tyrosine residues in an active receptor complex. As shown in Fig.2 A, FRS2 and ShcA directly bind to rat TrkA at Tyr499 (13Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) whereas the site of PLC-γ1 and CHK binding to TrkA is Tyr794 (10MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18225-18233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Grb2, in addition to being indirectly recruited to Trk via multiple adapters such as Shc and FRS2, also directly binds to the activation loop tyrosine residues, Tyr683 and Tyr684, on TrkA (10MacDonald J.I.

Receptors mutated at individual phosphotyrosine, Tyr(P), sites required for coupling Trk to specific signal transduction pathways have been a useful tool to correlate changes in biological responses to specific changes in Trk receptor protein: protein interactions. For example, it has recently been reported that mutation of Tyr515 on TrkB, the shared Tyr(P) residue involved in recruiting both Shc and FRS2 to the Trk receptors (13Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), is essential for sympathetic neuronal survival and local axon growth (16Atwal J.K. Massie B. Miller F.D. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 2000; 27: 265-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In an effort to isolate new signaling molecules utilized by the neurotrophic Trk receptors, we have performed several yeast two-hybrid screens using the ICD of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC as baits. As a result, we isolated a cDNA encoding human ShcB (also called Sck or Sli), a member of the Shc adaptor family including ShcA, ShcB, and ShcC (also called N-Shc). ShcB is highly expressed in both the peripheral and central nervous systems (8Sakai R. Henderson J.T. O'Bryan J.P. Elia A.J. Saxton T.M. Pawson T. Neuron. 2000; 28: 819-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 9Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B. Pelicci P.

Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Mori N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This is of particular relevance because ShcA is weakly expressed in sympathetic neurons, and not at all in sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system (1Nakamura T. Muraoka S. Sanokawa R. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6960-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C.J. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By comparison, ShcC is highly expressed in the central nervous system as well as in the sympathetic and neural crest-derived, dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons in the peripheral nervous system (1Nakamura T. Muraoka S. Sanokawa R. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6960-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 18O'Bryan J.P. Songyang Z. Cantley L. Der C.J. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2729-2734Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Interestingly, ShcA is expressed maximally in neuronal stem cells in the brain but is lost in post-mitotic neurons. In contrast, ShcC is not present in neural stem cells but is increasingly expressed during post-natal development (9Conti L. Sipione S. Magrassi L. Bonfanti L. Rigamonti D. Pettirossi V. Peschanski M. Haddad B. Pelicci P. Milanesi G. Pelicci G. Cattaneo E. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 579-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), suggesting that ShcA and ShcC may support different roles in the proliferation and differentiation of neurons. There are three isoforms of ShcA (p46, p52, and p66), one isoform of ShcB (p68), and two isoforms of ShcC (p55 and p69) generated through differential splicing or translation initiation codons (17Kojima T. Yoshikawa Y. Takada S. Sato M. Nakamura T. Takahashi N. Copeland N.G. Gilbert D.J. Jenkins N.A. Mori N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 284: 1039-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). All Shc isoforms contain a C-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, a central proline-rich region (CH1), and an N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (19Pelicci G. Dente L., De Giuseppe A. Verducci-Galletti B. Giuli S. Mele S. Vetriani C. Giorgio M. Pandolfi P.P. Cesareni G. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 633-641PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal extension of the longer isoforms (also contained within the single ShcB gene) encodes a second proline-rich collagen homology region (CH2). ShcA, ShcB, and ShcC share high sequence identity in their PTB and SH2 domains (over 70% identical in amino acid sequence) but in the CH1 and CH2 regions, the sequence identity is less than 35% (1Nakamura T. Muraoka S. Sanokawa R. Mori N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6960-6967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Kojima T. Yoshikawa Y. Takada S. Sato M. Nakamura T.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1111-1121PubMed Google Scholar). Binding of the ShcA PTB domain to target sites is affected by residues N-terminal to the Tyr(P) residue, whereas SH2 domain binding is modulated by amino acids C-terminal to the Tyr(P) residue (8Sakai R. Henderson J.T. O'Bryan J.P. Elia A.J. Saxton T.M. Pawson T. Neuron. 2000; 28: 819-833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the two domains utilize different recognition sequences to regulate protein-protein interactions and suggest that the Shc proteins bridge together different tyrosine-phosphorylated intracellular proteins. Moreover, phosphorylated ShcA activates the Ras/MAPK pathway through Tyr(P) sites in the CH1 region and recruitment of Grb2 (21Ravichandran K.S. Lorenz U. Shoelson S.E. Burakoff S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 593-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that each region of Shc has different biological roles. In this study, we defined the molecular basis and specificity of interaction between ShcB/ShcC and the Trk receptors. We identified that ShcB and ShcC bind to TrkA at Tyr499 in a Tyr(P)-dependent manner. In a similar way, ShcB and ShcC bind to rat TrkB at Tyr515. The PTB domain of ShcB, but not the SH2 domain, mediates binding to the Trk receptors. More importantly, ShcB/ShcC expression in PC12-, TrkB-, or TrkC-expressing cells supports NGF/BDNF/NT-3-dependent phosphorylation of ShcB/ShcC, resulting in Grb2 binding and enhanced MAPK activation. Furthermore, both ShcB and ShcC are activated in mouse cortical neurons upon stimulation with BDNF and NT3, indicating that they are endogenous targets of the Trk receptors in primary neurons. Interestingly, additional tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were identified in immunoprecipitation reactions with anti-ShcB/ShcC antibodies in primary cortical neurons, suggesting that these molecules are additional downstream targets of neurotrophin-activated ShcB/ShcC in primary neurons. Mouse NGF (2.5 S) was purchased from Harlan Bioproducts for Science. Recombinant BDNF and NT-3 were gifts from A. A. Welcher (Amgen Inc). The anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibody, 3F10, was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Anti-c-Myc antibodies were produced by a hybridoma, 9E10 (22Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell.

Rabbit antibodies to the C-terminal 14 residues of TrkA (J203) were prepared using standard techniques (13Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol.

Independently, we also made a rabbit antiserum to a peptide of 15 amino acid residues (449–463) (8Sakai R. Henderson J.T. O'Bryan J.P. Elia A.J. Saxton T.M. Pawson T.

For transfection, a total of 4 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm dishes. The next day, cells were re-fed and transfected with 2 μg each of indicated recombinant DNA constructs with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). After 24–48 h of transfection, untreated cells and cells treated with neurotrophin (NGF, BDNF, or NT-3; 100 ng/ml, 5 min) were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 137 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0)) containing 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, plus 2 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin.

For transfection, cells were seeded at the concentration of 6 × 105 cells/60-mm dish and, the next day, cells were transfected as described above. Cell lysates were prepared as described above. High-five insect cells were cultured in Grace's complete medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Recombinant baculovirus expressing wild type TrkA, with a HA N-terminal tag, was made as described previously (10MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol.

Clarified lysates were assayed for total protein (Bio-Rad Dc protein assay kit). The levels of receptor expression were determined by Western blotting with the anti-HA antibody, 3F10. The wild type rat TrkA receptor cDNA was used as the template to make the following constructs.

For yeast two-hybrid screening, constructs containing the ICD region of rat wild type TrkB (amino acid residues 458–821) and TrkC (amino acid residues 458–825) fused to the yeast GAL4 activation domain were created in pAS2.1. The ICD of TrkB was cut from pGEX-TrkB/ICD (10MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. Meakin S.O. J. Biol.

The mouse cDNA for the ShcC p55 isoform was amplified from adult mouse brain RNA by PCR with primers corresponding to sense (5′-GTCGACGAGTGCCACCAGGAAGAGCCG-3′) and antisense (5′-GGATCCTCAGGGTTTCCTCTCCACTGGTT-3′) sequence reported in the GenBankTM (accession number NM_009167). PCR products were cut out with SalI and BamHI and then ligated into appropriate sites of pRK5 generating an N-terminal fusion with Myc. The ShcB and ShcC sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Robarts Research Institute). The PTB and SH2 domains of ShcB were amplified by PCR using pACT2-ShcB as a template. The PCR primers for the PTB domain were sense (5′-GGAATTCTGGGGCCCGGGGTCTCCTA-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGCTCGAGCTCCTCGTCCCCCCAGGC-3′). The primers for the SH2 domain were sense (5′-GGAATTCTGGTACCACGGCCGGATGA-3′) and antisense (5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGTGAGACCACGCCA-3′). Fusion vectors for GST-ShcB PTB and GST-ShcB SH2 were constructed by cloning each restriction fragment into appropriate sites of pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences). The sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Robarts Research Institute). The GST fusion proteins for GST-ShcB full-length, GST-ShcB PTB, and GST-ShcB SH2 were obtained by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction ofEscherichia coli BL-21 cells harboring the corresponding constructs and purified from bacterial lysates with glutathione-Sepharose according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). For ShcB binding assays, COS cells were co-transfected with GST-fused ShcB in pEBG-3 and HA-tagged wild type and mutant Trk receptors in pCMX. Cells were stimulated with NGF or BDNF at 100 ng/ml for 5 min. Cell lysates, prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer, were precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-bound proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to Immobilon-P. Western blotting was performed with anti-HA 3F10 antibody (1:3000 dilution) as described before (13Meakin S.O. MacDonald J.I. Gryz E.A. Kubu C.J. Verdi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9861-9870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). For ShcC binding assays, COS cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged p55 ShcC in the pRK5 vector and HA-tagged wild type and mutant Trk receptors in pCMX. Cells were stimulated as described above. Cell lysates, prepared in Nonidet P-40 buffer, were precipitated by 2 μg of anti-Myc antibody, 9E10. The bound proteins were resolved on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and Western blotting was performed with anti-HA 3F10 antibody. To define the region of ShcB that mediates binding to TrkA, equal amounts (∼5 μg) of purified GST fusion proteins (including GST, GST-ShcB full-length, GST-ShcB PTB, GST-ShcB SH2, and GST-ShcA PTB) were mixed with 300 μg of insect cell lysates containing baculovirus expressed wild type TrkA (10MacDonald J.I.

After incubation overnight at 4 °C, beads were washed twice with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins precipitated by glutathione-Sepharose beads were resolved on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting with 3F10 antibody (1:3000). Purified GST and GST-ShcA PTB served as the negative and positive controls, respectively. For tyrosine phosphorylation assays, the transfected COS cells were stimulated with neurotrophin (NGF, BDNF, or NT-3 at 100 ng/ml for 5 min) and lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 1 mmsodium orthovanadate. Equal amounts of protein (200 μg) were immunoprecipitated with 9E10 anti-c-Myc antibodies (2 μg). After washing, the bound proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. Proteins were visualized by an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, RC20 (1:2000). For MAPK assays, Myc-ShcB and Myc-ShcC were overexpressed in PC12 and nnr5-TrkC cells. After 5–7 days of expression, cells were washed extensively by serum-free medium and then stimulated with NGF (50 ng/ml, 2 min) and NT-3 (50 ng/ml, 3 min), respectively. Cell lysates were prepared, and 50 μg of proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE. MAPK activation was detected by using an anti-active MAPK antibody (1:5,000) (Promega) and horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit antibody (1:10,000). The membrane was stripped as described below and then re-blotted with the anti-normal MAPK antibody (1:10,000) (Cell Signaling Technology).

S., Edlind, T., Kurtz, M., and Nickels, J. T., Jr. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 12702–12711). We have now determined the defects in sphingolipid metabolism inerg26-1 cells, examined their effects on cell growth, and initiated studies designed to elucidate how might changes in sterol levels coordinately regulate sphingolipid metabolism inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. Using [3H]inositol radiolabeling studies, we found that the biosynthetic rate and steady-state levels of specific hydroxylated forms of inositolphosphorylceramides were decreased in erg26-1 cells when compared with wild type cells. [3H]Dihydrosphingosine radiolabeling studies demonstrated that erg26-1 cells had decreased levels of the phytosphingosine-derived ceramides that are the direct precursors of the specific hydroxylated inositol phosphorylceramides found to be lower in these cells. Gene dosage experiments using the sphingolipid long chain sphingoid base (LCB) hydroxylase gene, SUR2, suggest that erg26-1 cells may accumulate LCB, thus placing one point of sterol regulation of sphingolipid synthesis possibly at the level of ceramide metabolism. The results from additional genetic studies using the sphingolipid hydroxylase and copper transporter genes, SCS7 and CCC2, respectively, suggest a second possible point of sterol regulation at the level of complex sphingolipid hydroxylation. In addition, [3H]inositol radiolabeling of sterol biosynthesis inhibitor-treated wild type cells and late sterol pathway mutants showed that additional blocks in sterol biosynthesis have profound effects on sphingolipid metabolism, particularly sphingolipid hydroxylation state. Finally, our genetic studies in erg26-1 cells using the LCB phosphate phosphatase gene, LBP1, suggest that increasing the levels of the LCB sphingoid base phosphate can remediate the temperature-sensitive phenotype of erg26-1cells. We had previously isolated the temperature-sensitive erg26-1 mutant and characterized the sterol defects in erg26-1 cells (Baudry, K., Swain, E., Rahier, A., Germann, M., Batta, A., Rondet, S., Mandala, S., Henry, K., Tint, G.

With regards to human pathology, a number of diseases have been attributed to the inappropriate trafficking and/or metabolism of sphingolipids. Human Niemann-Pick disorders are characterized by the intercellular mislocalization and accumulation of sphingolipid and cholesterol in lysosomes (9Ory D.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1529: 331-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 10Carstea E.D. et al.Science. 1997; 277: 228-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar, 11Schuchman E.H. Desnick R.J. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Metabolic Basis of Inherited Diseases.

Puri V. Dominguez M. Marks D.L. Traffic. 2000; 11: 807-815Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 13Puri V. Watanabe R. Dominguez M. Sun X. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 386-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating sphingolipid metabolism at the molecular level are not that well understood. However, there is some evidence suggesting that sphingolipid biosynthesis may be regulated coordinately with cholesterol metabolism in higher eukaryotes. Storey et al. (14Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 246-257Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar) showed that sphingomyelin and ceramide biosynthesis could be blocked by the addition of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin. They also demonstrated that a cholesterol auxotrophic Chinese hamster ovary cell line harboring defects in SREBP1 processing and cholesterol biosynthesis had greatly decreased levels of sphingomyelin (14Storey M.K. Byers D.M. Cook H.W. Ridgway N.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 336: 246-257Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, others showed that lovastatin treatment of CaCo-2 cells did not result in changes in sphingolipid biosynthesis (15Chen H. Born E. Mathur S.N. Field F.J. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2159-2167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is work from several laboratories showing that sterol esterification rapidly occurs in response to membrane depletion of sphingomyelin (16Slotte J.P. Bierman E.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 17Slotte J.P. Hedstrom G. Rannstrom S. Ekman S. Biochim. Biophys.

Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17243-17250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, Worgall et al. (20Worgall T.S. Johnson R.A. Seo T. Gierens H. Deckelbaum R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3878-3885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) showed that increasing ceramide levels or inhibiting ceramidase activity in Chinese hamster ovary cells decreases SRE-mediated transcription, presumably by reducing the levels of the transcriptionally active forms of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2. Thus, ceramide may mediate sphingolipid-dependent regulation of sterol metabolism in animals. Genetic studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have hinted at the possibility of a similar coordinate regulatory system in lower eukaryotes. Genome expression studies using antifungals targeting sterol biosynthesis have revealed that many lipid metabolic genes are transcriptionally regulated in response to changes in sterol levels (21Dimster-Denk D.

Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 1255-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Among those genes regulated were the SUR2 LCB hydroxylase gene required for the production of phytosphingosine and the LCB1 serine palmitoyltransferase gene involved in the first step of sphingolipid biosynthesis (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y.

Biol. 2001; 21: 6395-6405Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Several studies examining antifungal resistance in yeast have demonstrated a genetic interaction between sterol and sphingolipid metabolism and cell viability (26Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S.

Lipids. 1993; 28: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae should be an excellent model in which to study sphingolipid metabolism and regulation. Sphingolipids are essential for yeast cell viability, emphasizing their critical role in growth (29Dickson R.C. Wells G.B. Schmidt A. Lester R.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2176-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Almost all of the genes that are required for sphingolipid biosynthesis and metabolism have been cloned, allowing for the precise modulation of sphingolipid levels in this organism (30Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1426: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). In addition,S. cerevisiae synthesizes only three complex sphingolipids, inositolphosphorylceramide (IPC), mannose inositolphosphorylceramide (MIPC), and mannose diinositolphosphorylceramide (MIP2C), making the interpretation of the physiological roles of sphingolipids much more straightforward (31Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 26: 253-274PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we isolated the conditional erg26-1 yeast mutant in a genetic screen designed to obtained sphingolipid metabolic mutants (32Baudry K. Swain E. Rahier A. Germann M. Batta A. Rondet S. Mandala S. Henry K. Tint G.S. Edlind T. Kurtz M. Nickels J.T., Jr. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12702-12711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Our biochemical studies demonstrated that erg26-1cells were defective in 4α-carboxylsterol-C3 dehydrogenase activity, one of the three enzyme activities required for the conversion of 4,4-dimethylzymosterol to zymosterol. The defect in 4α-carboxylsterol-C3 dehydrogenase activity in erg26-1cells caused the abnormal accumulation of specific zymosterol intermediates and had an effect on neutral and phospholipid biosynthesis and metabolism. We now have gone back and examined in detail how the erg26-1 mutation affects sphingolipid biosynthesis and cell viability. The yeast strains used in this study are derived from W303-1A (MATa leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura3-1 his3-11, 15 can1-100). The yeast strains were grown in either YEPD (1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto-peptone, 2% glucose) or in synthetic minimal medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base (Difco) supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and adenine. Yeast transformations were performed using the procedure described by Ito et al. (33Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For routine propagation of plasmids, Escherichia coli XL1 Blue cells were used and grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (200 μg/ml). Yeast null mutants were generated by the one-step disruption method of Rothstein (34Rothstein R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 20-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (3419) Google Scholar) using individual YIp deletion constructs (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the KanMXcassette (36Longtine M.S. McKenzie A.r. Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Yeast strains harboring individual deletions were verified by PCR analysis. The LEU2- andURA3-containing 2μ plasmids, pRS425 and pRS426, respectively, were used to construct the various high copy vectors used in this study (35Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (GPD) (37Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar) was obtained from the vector pJR1133 that was provided by Drs. Jasper Rine and Chris Beh (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The GPD promoter was subcloned into pRS425 and pRS426, and these vectors were used for the overexpression studies. A 2μ vector overexpressing CCC2 was kindly provided by Dr. Valeria Culotta (Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health, Baltimore, MD). CCC2 was excised from this vector and subcloned into pRS426 that contained the GPD promoter. All of the genomic sequences subcloned into the various vectors were obtained by PCR amplification using the high fidelity Pfu polymerase. All of the DNA sequences that were generated by PCR were sequenced and compared with the yeast genome data base. Starting cultures for all of the lipid radiolabeling experiments were grown overnight at 27 °C to exponential phase in synthetic complete media or selective minimal media.A 600 were then taken, and the cultures were diluted to 5 × 106 cells/ml and preincubated at 27 and 37 °C for 3 h before antifungal treatment and/or radiolabeling. Radiolabeled lipids were resolved by TLC and visualized by autoradiography (Kodak XAR5). The percentage value of each lipid species was determined by densitometry using Bio-Rad model GS-670 Imaging Densitometer and Molecular Analyst software, version 1.4.1. For pulse radiolabeling of complex sphingolipids, the cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 30 min. For steady-state labeling, the cultures were incubated with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol for 5 h. Radiolabeled sphingolipids were extracted with ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (15:15:5:1:0.018), treated with methylamine as described (38Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform, methanol, acetic acid, and water (16:6:4:1.6). When necessary, wild type cultures were preincubated with specified antifungal compounds as described for the analysis of sterols (see below). For pulse radiolabeling of ceramides, cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]dihydrosphingosine for 20 min. For steady-state radiolabeling, the cultures were incubated with 5 μCi/ml [3H]dihydrosphingosine for 30 min, pelleted, and washed in media lacking radiolabel, and chased for an additional 3 h. To help resolve the various ceramides species, wild type cultures were incubated in the absence and presence of 140 μmfumonisin B1. Radiolabeled ceramides were extracted with ethanol, water, diethyl ether, pyridine, 4.2 n ammonium hydroxide (15:15:5:1:0.018) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using chloroform, methanol, acetic acid (95:4.5:0.5) (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For pulse labeling of sterols, antifungal-treated cultures were incubated at 30 °C with 1μCi/ml [14C]acetate for 30 min. For steady-state labeling of sterols, the cultures were incubated at 30 °C with 5 μCi/ml [14C] acetate for 4 h. Radiolabeled sterols were extracted using chloroform, methanol (2:1) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC using petroleum ether, diethyl ether, acetic acid (70:30:1). In all cases, the cultures were preincubated for 1 h in the absence and presence of a specified concentration of antifungal compound (40 ng/ml fenpropimorph, 2 μg/ml fluconazole, 2 μg/ml terbinafine) prior to radiolabeling cells for sterol analysis. For pulse labeling of phospholipids, the cultures were incubated with 50 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 20 min. For steady-state radiolabeling, the cultures were incubated with 25 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for several generations. Radiolabeled phospholipids were extracted using the spheroplast method of Atkinson et al. (39Atkinson K. Fogel S. Henry S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 6653-6661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described previously (38Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To analyze total fatty acids, the cells were cultured at 27 °C in synthetic media to a density of ∼1 × 107 cells/ml. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh media prewarmed at 27 °C (control cultures) or 37 °C. Incubation of all cultures continued for three additional hours at the indicated temperatures. The cells were harvested again and washed with sterile water to remove residual media. Fatty acid methyl esters were prepared by HCl methanolysis of whole cell lipids (40Browse J. McCourt P.J. Somerville C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Whole cells were collected by centrifugation in glass screw-capped test tubes. All of the residual water was removed by aspiration, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of 1 m methanolic HCl, 5% 2,2-dimethoxypropane (v/v). Test tubes was purged with nitrogen and incubated at 85 °C for 1 h. Fatty acid methyl esters were extracted from cooled samples by the addition of 1 ml of hexane, ethyl ether (1:1 v/v) and 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl. The samples were vigorously mixed and then centrifuged to advance phase separation. The organic phase was collected and passed over a silica gel mini-column preconditioned with hexane, ethyl ether (1:1 v/v) solvent and then washed with a minimal amount (1–2 ml) of solvent: The column flow-through was dried under nitrogen, and dried fatty acid methyl esters were resuspended in 200 μl of hexane. The samples of fatty acid methyl esters were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph using a 30-m HP-5 column. Instrument conditions were as follows: injection port temperature, 220 °C; detector temperature, 300 °C; initial oven temperature, 120 °C. After a 1-min hold at 120 °C, the oven temperature was increased at 2 °C/min up to a temperature of 150 °C followed by a 4 °C/min increase to a final temperature of 300 °C and held for 5 min. Identification of cellular fatty acid species was by comparison of retention times to those of standard compounds and by GC/MS analysis using data base files of fatty acid methyl ester spectra. GC/MS analysis was performed on a Hewlett-Packard model 6890 gas chromatograph and a Hewlett-Packard model 5973 Mass Selective Detector. The run conditions were identical to those described above for gas-liquid chromatography. We first analyzed the complex sphingolipid compositions of wild type and erg26-1 cells using lipid radiolabeling studies and TLC. In these studies, we examined the rates of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of sphingolipids. Our experiments were carried out at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures for erg26-1 cell growth. The results of these studies are shown in Fig. 2. Using [H3]inositol radiolabeling studies, we found thaterg26-1 cells harbored defects in the rate of biosynthesis of several hydroxylated IPC species (Fig. 2). These defects were detected at both temperatures in erg26-1 cells. Using yeast mutants lacking individual sphingolipid hydroxylase activities (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24Grilley M.M. Stock S.D. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. Takemoto J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11062-11068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar,42Fu D. Beeler T.J. Dunn T.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), we were able to determine what IPC species were affected by theerg26-1 mutation. Our results revealed thaterg26-1 cells grown at the permissive temperature had an increased rate of biosynthesis of IPC-C (4.2-fold) while exhibiting a decreased rate of biosynthesis of IPC-D (8.5-fold) when compared with wild type cells grown under the exact conditions (Fig. 2,Pulse, 27°, ERG26 versus erg26-1). IPC-B, MIPC, and MIP2C biosyntheses were all unaffected in erg26-1 cells grown at this temperature. Strikingly, we found that IPC biosynthesis was almost completely shut down in temperature-shifted erg26-1 cells. The biosynthetic levels of the three predominant IPC species detected inerg26-1 cells at the permissive temperature, IPC-B, IPC-C, and IPC-D, were all drastically reduced in temperature-shiftederg26-1 cells (Fig. 2, Pulse, 37°,ERG26 versus erg26-1). In contrast, we observed only a slight decrease in MIPC biosynthesis (2.3-fold) and a slight increase in the biosynthesis of MIP2C in temperature-shifted erg26-1 cells (1.4-fold) (Fig. 2,Pulse, 37°, ERG26 versus erg26-1). When we examined steady-state sphingolipid composition, we found thaterg26-1 cells harbored defects in their ability to sustain normal levels of the major hydroxylated IPC species, IPC-B, IPC-C, and IPC-D (Fig. 2, Steady-State). A decrease in the levels of these three IPC species was detected at both temperatures inerg26-1 cells (Fig. 2, Steady-State,27° and 37°). In the case of IPC-B, we did not detect any accumulation of this complex sphingolipid inerg26-1 cells at either temperature. Whereas the steady-state levels of IPC-C were decreased 15- and 7.3-fold, the IPC-D levels were decreased 6.2- and 4-fold, at 27 and 37 °C, respectively. On the other hand, steady-state MIPC levels were only slightly decreased (1.8-fold, 27o ; 2.0-fold,37o ), whereas MIP2C levels were not affected in these cells at either temperature. To ascertain what step(s) in the sphingolipid pathway is regulated by sterol levels in erg26-1 cells, we determined the rates of biosynthesis and metabolism of the hydroxylated ceramides using [H3]dihydrosphingosine radiolabeling and TLC analysis (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Using this method, we were able to determine the biosynthetic and metabolic levels of four of the five hydroxylated ceramide species known to be synthesized in yeast cells (Fig. 1). We found that erg26-1 cells were defective in their ability to synthesize and accumulate the phytosphingosine-containing ceramides, ceramide-B and ceramide-C (Fig. 3). Ceramide-B is the precursor for ceramide-C, where ceramide-C is produced through the action of the sphingolipid hydroxylase, Scs7p (Fig. 1) (23Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The rate of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of ceramide-B and -C were most severely reduced at the restrictive growth temperature (Fig. 3, B and D). The steady-state levels of ceramide-B and -C in temperature-shifted erg26-1cells were only 22 and 28% of that seen in wild type cells (Fig.3 D). The rate of biosynthesis and steady-state levels of the dihydrosphingosine-containing ceramides, ceramide-A and ceramide-B′, in erg26-1 cells were similar to those seen in wild type cells (Fig. 3). We were unable to resolve ceramide-D using this TLC method. Therefore, we cannot say whether the biosynthetic and/or the metabolic level of this ceramide species was affected by the erg26-1 mutation. C26 fatty acids are used exclusively to synthesize complex sphingolipids in yeast (43Daum G. Lees N.D. Bard M. Dickson R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1471-1510Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). We reasoned that the defects seen in complex sphingolipid metabolism in erg26-1cells may cause the accumulation of C26 fatty acids, which in turn may have secondary effects on total fatty acid metabolism. Thus, we determined the steady-state levels of various fatty acid species in wild type and erg26-1 cells at the permissive and restrictive temperatures using GC/MS analysis. We found that at either temperature, erg26-1 cells contained dramatically less C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acid species while overaccumulating C26:0 fatty acid (Fig.4 A). erg26-1 cells had 4- and 3-fold reductions in C10:0 and C12:0 fatty acids while accumulating ∼3-fold higher C26:0 fatty acid at both growth temperatures. In addition, we found that erg26-1 cells also accumulated low levels of C20:0, C20:1, and C24:0 fatty acid species at the restrictive temperature (∼0.03–0.10% of total fatty acid) (not shown). In contrast, the levels of the major fatty acid species in yeast cells, C16:0, C16:1, C18:0, and C18:1, were similar inerg26-1 and wild type cells at both temperatures (Fig.4 B). The loss of proper ceramide-B levels inerg26-1 cells could be due either to a decrease in its biosynthesis or an increase in its turnover or both. This may lead to the accumulation of cytotoxic levels of LCB and/or LCBP at high temperatures (44Kim S. Fyrst H. Saba J. Genetics. 2000; 156: 1519-1529Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 45Jenkins G.M.

To begin to examine whether LCB and/or LCBP may accumulate in erg26-1 cells and contribute to the observed growth defect, we took a genetic approach and first determined how altering the gene dosage of individual hydroxylase genes affectederg26-1 viability.

These results clearly document that FAD is the site of the 2-electron reduction of APS to sulfite and AMP. Reaction of APS reductase enzyme with sulfite and AMP leads to partial reduction of the [4Fe-4S] centers and formation of the anionic FAD semiquinone.

In the current study we examined the role of nitric oxide (NO), a potential mediator of apoptosis, during bile acid-induced apoptosis. Freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and hepatic mitochondria generated NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) in a concentration- and time-dependent manner when exposed to the toxic bile salt glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) (25–500 μm), which was prevented by the nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitorsN G -monomethyl-N-arginine monoacetate (l-NMMA) and 1400W. Relationships between hepatocyte NO production and apoptosis were examined by comparing the effects of NOS inhibitors with other inhibitors of GCDC-induced apoptosis. Inhibitors of caspases 8 and 9, the mitochondrial permeability transition blocker cyclosporin A, and the antioxidant idebenone reduced NO generation and apoptosis in GCDC-treated hepatocytes. In contrast, NOS inhibitors had no effect on GCDC-induced apoptosis despite marked reduction of NO and ONOO−. However, treatment with the NO donorsS-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine and spermine NONOate [N-(-aminoethyl)N-(2-hydroxy-2-nitrohydrazino)-1,2-ethylenediamine) inhibited apoptosis and caspase 3 activity while significantly elevating NO levels above GCDC-stimulated levels.

Although the mechanisms responsible for bile acid-induced hepatotoxicity have not been fully elucidated, exposure of freshly isolated or primary cultured hepatocytes to high concentrations (500 μm--1 mm) of hydrophobic bile acids leads to hepatocyte necrosis (2Sokol R.J.

Although the induction and execution of bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis may involve a variety of cell signaling pathways, it is clear that oxidative stress and mitochondrial perturbations are two critical steps in this apoptosis model. Several laboratories demonstrated that hydrophobic bile acids directly stimulate generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)1 from hepatocytes (2Sokol R.J. Winklhofer-Roob B.M. Devereaux M.W.

Recent attention has also focused on the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) during apoptosis. Induction of the MPT, characterized by large amplitude swelling and loss of the electrochemical potential across the inner mitochondrial membrane (8Crompton M. Biochem.

Evidence from several laboratories indicates that stimulation of the MPT by bile acids is commensurate with increased generation of ROS (7Rodrigues C.M. Fan G., Ma, X. Kren B.T. Steer C.J. J. Clin.

FEBS Lett. 2001; 495: 12-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar).Recently, nitric oxide (NO) has emerged as a regulatory molecule involved in control of a variety of biological processes. Enzymatically produced by constitutive and inducible forms of NO synthases (NOS), NO is found in a variety of cell types (for reviews, see Refs. 17Griffith O.W. Stuehr D.J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 707-736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 18Kroncke K-D. Suschek C.V. Kolb-Bachofen V. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2000; 2: 585-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition to its role as a cell signaling agent, NO functions as an antioxidant by reacting with other free radical species, such as superoxide, in a diffusion-controlled reaction yielding the potent oxidizing and nitrating peroxynitrite (ONOO−). Therefore, NO can operationally function as either a prooxidant or antioxidant. Most toxicity studies in rat hepatocytes support a potent protective effect of NO, particularly against cell death by apoptotic pathways (19Chung H-T. Pae H-O. Choi B-M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Of particular relevance are recent reports demonstrating that NO, administered exogenously or stimulated endogenously via NOS induction, inhibits tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis (19Chung H-T. Pae H-O. Choi B-M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar, 20Kim Y-M. Talanian R.V. Billiar T.R. J. Biol.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1251-1262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the anti-apoptotic effects of NO including increased cGMP production, nitrosylation of caspases, inhibition of Bid cleavage and translocation to mitochondria, and inhibition of the MPT (for review, see Ref. 19Chung H-T. Pae H-O. Choi B-M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 282: 1075-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Finally, it has been reported that NO can either stimulate or inhibit the MPT in liver mitochondria, often depending upon experimental conditions and the source of mitochondria (23Balakirev M.Y. Khramtsov V.V. Zimmer G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 24Brookes P.S. Salinas E.P. Darley-Usmar K. Eiserich J.P. Freeman B.A. Darley-Usmar V.M. Anderson P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20474-20479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar).With little evidence assessing the importance of NO as a primary mediator of bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis, the current study was performed to elucidate if NO promoted or protected against this injury. In these studies, freshly isolated rat hepatocytes were used rather than cultured or hepatoma cell lines so that homeostasis of physiologic bile acid uptake (25Suchy F.J. Semin. Liver Dis. 1993; 13: 235-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and endogenous antioxidant pathways (26Glascott P.A. Gilfor E. Farber J.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1155-1162PubMed Google Scholar) were maintained to better reflect the in vivoconditions observed during cholestatic liver diseases and so that physiologic apoptotic pathways were intact. The bile acid chosen for this study was the sodium salt of glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC), a toxic, hydrophobic bile acid that accumulates in the human liver during cholestasis (27Greim H. Czygan P. Schaffner F. Popper H. Biochem. Med. 1972; 8: 280-286Crossref Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to determine 1) if NO or its reaction product with superoxide, ONOO−, was generated from isolated rat hepatocytes or liver mitochondria exposed to concentrations of GCDC previously observed to promote hepatotoxicity and the MPT, 2) if modulation of NO status by employing either NOS inhibitors or NO donors prevented or promoted hepatocyte apoptosis induced by GCDC, and 3) the effect of NOS inhibitors and NO donors on mitochondrial pathways involved in GCDC-induced apoptosis.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have demonstrated that neither NO nor ONOO− play a role in mediating hepatocellular apoptosis induced by hydrophobic bile acids and that elevated NO levels may have an anti-apoptotic effect that does not involve mitochondrial pathways of apoptosis. By using fluorescent probes specific for NO and ONOO−, we have provided evidence that GCDC stimulates NO/ONOO− production from both freshly isolated rat hepatocytes and liver mitochondria by a NOS-dependent pathway. These probes offer many benefits for assessing NO/ONOO− status including the ability to detect low intracellular concentrations (which may allow detection of NO from constitutively produced NO) and their lack of reactivity toward other reactive species such as superoxide and hydroperoxides (28Kojima H. Sakurai K. Kikchi K. Kawahara S. Kirino Y. Nagoshi H. Hirata Y. Akaike T. Maeda H. Nagano T. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 1997; 20: 1229-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 29Kojima H. Nakatsubo N.

Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Corroboration of the lack of reactivity of these probes toward hydroperoxides was demonstrated in our experimental model.These results are the first to demonstrate stimulation of NO and ONOO− generation in both isolated rat hepatocytes and liver mitochondria by a hydrophobic bile acid under conditions that may exist in the cholestatic liver. Similar results were recently reported in endothelial vascular cells exposed to bile acids, in which the hydrophobicity of the bile acids correlated with their capacities to increase NO production (37Nakajima T. Okuda Y. Chisaki K. Shin W-S. Iwasawa K. Morita T. Matsumoto A. Suzuki J.I. Suzuki S. Yamada N. Toyo-Oka T. Nagai R. Omata M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 130: 1457-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In addition to NO production, ONOO− generation in rat hepatocytes and liver mitochondria further demonstrates the GCDC stimulation of superoxide. We have previously shown that ROS are generated by the respiratory chain of mitochondria exposed to bile acids (38Winklhofer-Roob B.W. McKim J.M. Devereaux M.S. Sokol R.J. Hepatology. 1996; 24 (Abstr. 845): 338Google Scholar) and have proposed that impaired electron transport (39Krahenbuhl S. Talos C. Fischer S. Reichen J. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 471-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was responsible for mitochondrial superoxide generation. The mechanisms responsible for the increased generation of NO from rat hepatocytes or liver mitochondria exposed to GCDC are unclear. Under normal physiological conditions, basal low levels of NO within the liver are controlled by endothelial NOS, which in turn is primarily regulated by intracellular calcium flux and calmodulin binding (40Michel J.B. Feron O. Sacks D. Michel T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15583-15586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). However, upon stimulation by cytokines or microbial products such as lipopolysaccharides, induction of a distinct NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), results in rapid synthesis of NO. Regulation of this NOS isoform occurs at both transcriptional and post-translational steps by a variety of signal-transducing agents including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (reviewed in Ref. 41Wright K.L. Ward S.G. Mol. Cell Biol. Res. Commun. 2000; 4: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inasmuch as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation has been shown to prevent hepatocyte apoptosis induced by hydrophobic bile acids (but not GCDC) (42Rust C. Karnitz L.M. Paya C.V. Moscat J. Simari R.D. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20210-20216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 43Takikawa Y. Miyoshi H. Rust C. Roberts P. Siegel R. Mandal P.K. Millikan R.E. Gores G.J. Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1810-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is unclear whether the NO stimulated by GCDC is the result of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase regulation of either iNOS or “constitutive” NOS isoforms. Further characterization of iNOS-dependent NO production from rat hepatocytes was recently reported by Fariss and co-workers (44Nicholls-Grzemski F.A. Tirmenstein M.A. Fariss M.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1223-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 45Tirmenstein M.A. Nicholls-Grzemski F.A. Schmittgen T.D. Zakrajsek B.A. Fariss M.W. Toxicol. Sci. 2000; 53: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Their studies revealed time-dependent increases of nitrite formation and expression of iNOS and NOS enzymatic activity after 3 h of incubation. Because we were unable to demonstrate increased iNOS expression by GCDC (data not shown), it is unlikely that iNOS induction was responsible for the observed GCDC-stimulated NO that appeared within 1 h of incubation.Production of NO in both isolated rat hepatocytes and liver mitochondria exposed to GCDC suggested a possible important regulatory role of NO during bile acid-induced hepatotoxicity. Although others have shown that bile acids may promote hepatocyte apoptosis through pathways involving activation of caspase 8 (46Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), protein kinase c (47Gonzalez B. Fisher C. Rossner B.G. Mol. Cell.

Gastroenterology. 2001; 120: 1810-1817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), our laboratory has reported ROS generation and MPT as key steps in bile acid-induced apoptosis. As a cell-signaling agent and biologically relevant free radical, NO has been found to either promote or prevent apoptosis. For example, stimulation of NO generation by induction of iNOS may promote apoptosis in macrophages and hepatocytes (48Brune B. Sandau K. von Knethen A. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1998; 63: 817-825PubMed Google Scholar, 49Wang J.H. Redmond H.P., Wu, Q.D. Bouchier-Hayes D. Am. J.

Despite conflicting data, however, the preponderance of evidence strongly supports the notion that NO, supplied exogenously or stimulated via iNOS, acts as an anti-apoptotic or cell survival factor, particularly during tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas ligand-dependent hepatocyte apoptosis (19Chung H-T.

In the current study, by utilizing two distinct NOS inhibitors, l-NMMA, a nonspecific inhibitor, and 1400W, a specific inhibitor of iNOS activity (52Koarai A. Ichinose M. Sugiura H. Yamagata S. Hattori T. Shirato K. Pulm. Pharmacol. Ther. 2000; 13: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), we observed that suppression of GCDC-stimulated endogenous NO production (as measured by both intracellular DAF fluorescence and extracellular nitrite accumulation), failed to alter induction of hepatocyte apoptosis. One likely explanation for the lack of effect of NOS inhibitors is that the amount of NO produced was insufficient to modulate pathways critical to the execution of apoptosis. However, in concordance with hepatocyte apoptosis induced by tumor necrosis factor-α or Fas ligand (19Chung H-T. Pae H-O. Choi B-M. Billiar T.R. Kim Y-M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Furthermore, these data show that SNN, a rapidly yielding NO donor, produced greater quantities of NO and inhibition of apoptosis and caspase 3 activity compared with SNAP, a slower, less “efficient” NO donor (53Hou Y.-C Janczuk A. Wang P.G. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1999; 5: 417-441PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a relationship between NO concentration and protection against apoptosis. An additional mechanism for the protection of NO against bile acid-induced apoptosis could be by preventing mitochondrial perturbations. In this regard, NO has been shown to both induce (50Ghafouritar P. Schenk H. Klein S.D. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31185-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar,54Hortelano S. Dallaporta B. Zamzami N. Hisch T. Susin S.A. Marza I. Bosca L. Kroemer G.

Results from the present study clearly demonstrate that modulating NO levels with either NOS inhibitors or NO donors had no effect on two key mitochondrial factors involved in GCDC-induced apoptosis (14Yerushalmi B. Dahl R. Devereaux M.W. Gumpricht E. Sokol R.J. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 616-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), the MPT and cytochromec release. Thus the protective effects of NO in our model do not appear to involve mitochondria directly, but rather, interactions with essential cytosolic caspases.In our experiments, NO generation was also completely suppressed by a variety of inhibitors of hepatocyte apoptosis that do not directly affect NOS activity. The choice of these inhibitors allowed examination of the potential mechanisms and locations of NO production relative to mechanisms of bile acid-induced hepatocyte apoptosis. For instance, inhibition of NO and apoptosis by CsA raises the intriguing possibility that the NO generated from GCDC-treated hepatocytes is contingent upon induction of the MPT. Interestingly, one report describes mitochondrial NOS-dependent stimulation of cytochrome crelease, which was not mediated by the MPT but rather through formation of ONOO− (50Ghafouritar P. Schenk H. Klein S.D. Richter C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31185-31188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Clearly, the prevention of NO generation by multiple inhibitors of GCDC-induced apoptosis at both upstream (caspase 8 inhibition) and downstream (caspase 9 inhibition) locations suggests that NO generation occurs as a consequence of cellular apoptotic events in this model.Another potential site of regulation of hepatocyte apoptosis by NO are protein kinases and mitogen-activated protein kinases. Hydrophobic bile acids have been shown to promote hepatocyte apoptosis by ligand-independent activation of Fas and TRAIL death receptor cascades (55Higuchi H Bronk S.F. Takikawa Y. Werneburg N.

Mol. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 207: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Among those members of the protein kinase family involved in cell apoptosis, mitogen-activated protein kinases have been reported to protect hepatocytes against bile acid-induced apoptosis (57Qiao D.

Activation of this pathway afforded cytoprotection through enhanced expression c-FLIP isoforms that inhibit procaspase 8 cleavage. Conversely, inasmuch as ROS generation has been shown to activate c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and other protein kinases (60Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 807-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar), it is proposed that bile acid-stimulated ROS generation may be an upstream event in hepatocytes exposed to hydrophobic bile acids that may trigger activation of protein kinases involved in promoting cellular apoptosis. Finally, a recently characterized member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase (ASK-1) can be activated by cytotoxic stimuli including Fas, tumor necrosis factor-α, or ROS and is essential for the induction of apoptosis in a number of differentiated cell lines (61Tobiume K.

However, precise mechanisms of glycolytic flux and its regulation in IP remain to be elucidated. In open chest pigs, IP was achieved by two cycles of 10-min coronary artery occlusion and 30-min reperfusion prior to a 45-min index ischemia and 120-min reperfusion. Myocardial contents in glycolytic intermediates were assessed by high performance liquid chromatographic analysis of serial myocardial biopsies under control conditions and IP.

Reimer K. Annu. Rev. Med. 1991; 42: 225-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). To limit energy deficit in conditions of energy shortage, e.g. hypoxia and ischemia, myocardial energy production switches from the preferential use of fatty acids to carbohydrates, thereby allowing maintenance of adequate ATP synthesis when decreased oxygen availability becomes the limiting factor (2Bing R. Harvey Lecture Series. Academic Press, New York1954–1955: 27-70Google Scholar, 3Bing R. Fishman A. Richards D. Circulation of the Blood: Men and Ideals.

Physiol. 1974; 36: 413-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). However, in zero-flow ischemia, experimental analysis has shown increased glycolysis to be a double-edged sword, as the accumulation of glycolytic end products (6Rovetto M. Lamberton W. Neely J. Circ. Res. 1975; 37: 742-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 7Neely J. Grotyohann L. Circ. Res. 1984; 55: 816-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar) outweighs the potential benefits of increased ATP synthesis. In accordance with this paradigm, myocardial protection by prior exposure to ischemic preconditioning (IP)1 employs a limitation in myocardial energy deficit (8Reimer K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 793: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 9Vogt A. Ackermann C. Noe T. Kübler W. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1999; 33 (abstr.): 387AGoogle Scholar). Because IP tremendously reduces ischemic myocardial energy demands (8Reimer K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 793: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), energy deficit is largely decreased at even reduced rates of anaerobic glycolytic ATP formation in zero-flow ischemia. There is good evidence that this attenuation in ischemic lactate accumulation represents an important mechanism whereby IP myocardium better withstands the challenges of sustained ischemia. Although a decrease in anaerobic glycolytic flux is a consistent finding in myocardium protected by ischemic preconditioning (10Jennings R. Murry C. Reimer K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1991; 23: 1449-1458Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Murry C. Richard V. Reimer K. Jennings R. Circ.

Heart J. 1995; 16: 563-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the precise mechanism used to adjust anaerobic glycolytic flux still remains unclear. The elucidation of this adaptive mechanism, which is not merely of theoretical interest, was the aim of our study. To analyze the regulation of metabolic pathways, traditional concepts mostly imply that control over a pathway is achieved by action on a single pathway enzyme, which is often assumed to be a nonequilibrium step near the beginning of the pathway subjected to feedback inhibition (13Kübler W. Spieckermann P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1970; 1: 351-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Gordon E. Morgan H. Fozzard H. Haber E. Jennings R. Katz A. Morgan H. The Heart and Cardiovascular System: Scientific Foundations. Second Edition. Raven Press, New York1992: 151-161Google Scholar). However, because the rise of metabolic control analysis (MCA) (15Fell D. Understanding the Control of Metabolism. Portland Press, London1997Google Scholar) there is growing evidence that these comfortable, time honored concepts may mislead more than enlighten. Hence, the tools of MCA were used to obtain a state-of-the-art analysis of glycolytic regulation in ischemic myocardium protected by preceding ischemic preconditioning. The experimental protocol described in this study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the District of Karlsruhe, Germany. All animals in this study were handled in accordance with the guiding principles in care and use of animals as approved by the American Physiological Society and the investigation conformed with the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, United States National Institutes of Health. 12 castrated German domestic pigs with body weights between 25.0 and 32.5 kg (27.8 ± 0.32 kg) were used in this study employing an established model of coronary occlusion and reperfusion as described in detail previously (16Vogt A. Ando H. Arras M. Elsässer A. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 1998; 31: 1134-1141Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The experimental protocol is shown in Fig. 1. In all animals, myocardial ischemia causing infarction was induced by a 45-min LAD occlusion (index ischemia). The animals of the control group (C,n = 6) were only subjected to index ischemia followed by 120 min reperfusion. In the IP group, the animals were subjected to two ischemic episodes (10 min each, with 30 min reperfusion between) before the onset of the 45-min index ischemia (IP long;n = 6). Myocardial drill biopsies were taken at the end of the stabilization period, i.e. before any experimental intervention, from virgin, non-ischemic myocardium, and directly before occluding the LAD at the onset of index ischemia. During the 45-min LAD occlusion, biopsies were taken from the center of the ischemic area after 2, 5, 10, 20, and 45 min. Determination of myocardial infarct size was determined according to standard methods by identifying ischemic myocardium using fluorescent microspheres and detecting infarcted myocardium following incubation in triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Quantification was performed by normalizing infarcted myocardial mass (infarcted region) to left ventricular myocardium or to the mass of ischemic myocardium (risk region). These ratios are given in percent. Left ventricular drill biopsies (≈20 mg each) were taken at various time points (Fig. 1). The biopsies were immediately frozen (within 5 s) and kept in liquid nitrogen until further use. Homogenization and deproteinization were performed in ice-cold 60% acetonitrile (v/v) using a Branson sonifier. Using two different high performance liquid chromatography protocols, the myocardial contents in ATP, ADP, and AMP, and the intermediary metabolites and end products of glycolysis were determined (17Vogt A. Htun P. Arras M. Podzuweit T. Schaper W. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 389-400PubMed Google Scholar, 18Sellevold O. Jynge P. Aarstad K. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1986; 18: 517-527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The injury caused by the biopsies did not interfere with the triphenyltetrazolium chloride stainings. Myocardial glycogen contents was assessed according to Ref. 19Weinbrenner C. Wang P. Downey J. Basic Res. Cardiol. 1996; 91: 374-381PubMed Google Scholar. Dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate could not be detected. The DHAP content was, therefore, calculated from the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate content assuming the equilibrium state of the triose-phosphate isomerase reaction (20Buddecke E. Grundriss der Biochemie. 7 Ed. Walter de Gruyter & Co., Berlin1984Google Scholar). Two- and 3-phosphoglycerate (2-PG and 3-PG, respectively) were not always clearly separated in the chromatograms, although its common peak could be easily detected. The individual proportions were calculated according to the equilibrium of the phosphoglyceromutase (PGM) reaction as shown. 0.154=[2­PG][3­PG]Equation 1 The equilibrium of isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase are known to be unaffected by ischemia (13Kübler W. Spieckermann P. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1970; 1: 351-377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Free myocardial ADP content was calculated from the myocardial contents of ATP and AMP, assuming an equilibrium state of the adenylate kinase reaction (21Connett R. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 254: R949-R959PubMed Google Scholar). Glycolytic flux (J) (in micromole of C6-units/g wet weight/min) during ischemia was calculated from the accumulation of lactate and pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GA3P) (22Spriet L. Pflügers Arch. 1990; 417: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).J=C6−units metabolizedΔt=0.5Δ[lactate]ΔtEquation 2 Our experimental animal model employs total myocardial ischemia. As a consequence, the use of extracellular glucose, which is taken up by the cell via glucose transporters and enters glycolysis after phosphorylation to glucose 6-phosphate (Glu-6-P) by hexokinase can be quantitatively neglected. In total myocardial ischemia, fuel for glycolysis is only provided by the glycosyl units resulting from glycogen breakdown that enter glycolysis via glucose 1-phosphate (Glu-1-P), and to a lesser extent, free glucose. As 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate could not be detected, glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase were considered as a single glycolytic step. As 2- and 3-PG, as well as of DHAP, contents were calculated the given values are not mathematically independent. Therefore, also GAPDH and 3-PGK as well as PGM and enolase were also put together. On basis of these calculations, anaerobic glycolytic regulation was investigated using flux:metabolite co-responses as described in detail previously (23Thomas S. Fell D. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).Oflux,metabolite=Equation 3 ∂ln flux∂ln metabolite≈Δln fluxΔln metabolite≈Δflux/fluxΔmetabolite/metaboliteNote that it follows from the definition of a co-responseO J,S that J = cSO , wherec is a constant. Where an enzyme converts metabolite S to metabolite P the co-responses O J,S andO J,P involve the same flux J, soO J,S /O J,P =ΔlnP/ΔlnS, and if the enzyme had no change in its mass:action ratio (P/S) when ΔlnP = ΔlnS then the co-responses will be equal. IfO J,S is greater than O J,P then there has been a relatively larger increase in product concentration, and the reaction has moved closer to equilibrium, whereas ifO J,S is smaller than O J,P , the reaction has moved away from equilibrium. Where only a single enzyme in a pathway is altered, flux:substrate co-response coefficients are likely to be less than 1 (or less than the Hill coefficient for cooperative enzymes) (23Thomas S. Fell D. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Under several known physiological conditions (e.g. hypoxia) (23Thomas S. Fell D. J. Theor. Biol. 1996; 182: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), observed co-response coefficients are larger than this; exact mechanistic explanations of this are not known, but in theory, parallel activation of several steps (the “universal method” (24Kacser H. Acerenza L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), multisite modulation (25Fell D. Thomas S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 26Thomas S. Fell D. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 65-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), or proportional activation (27Korzeniewski B. Harper M. Brand M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar)) can account for this. Enzymes that are extremely close to equilibrium (25Fell D. Thomas S. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) can show large co-responses during passive adaptation to a change in metabolic flux, but this would imply virtually no detectable change in the displacement from equilibrium, and hence Δln (P/S) ∪ 0, with virtually identical substrate and product co-responses as described above. A negative flux:substrate co-response corresponds to a classic crossover effect, where activation of an enzyme has induced a decrease in its substrate. Thus the co-response coefficients provide insight into the events associated with a change in flux. Our study is based on two major assumptions. (i) Essentially maintained tissue integrity during index ischemia and (ii) constant levels and activities in the enzymes of anaerobic glycolysis, which are both supported by a vast body of evidence. (i) Lethal myocardial injury is initialized and determined during ischemia, whereas the demarcation of necrosis happens during reperfusion. In this context, it is one of the seminal findings of myocardial pathophysiology that “myocytes have suffered severe injury before reperfusion, and that the dramatic consequences of reperfusion are simply postmortem manifestations of lethal injury made possible by the sudden availability of large volumes of plasma water, calcium, or both. In other words, reperfusion accelerates the undertaking events associated with cell death” (28Reimer K. Jennings R. Fozzard H. Haber E. Jennings R. Katz A. Morgan H. The Heart and Cardiovascular System: Scientific Foundations. Second edition. Raven Press, New York1992: 1875-1973Google Scholar). (ii) Because protein synthesis and degradation are inhibited in myocardial ischemia (29Morgan H. Chua B. Russo L. Fozzard H. Haber E. Jennings R. Katz A. Morgan H. The Heart and Cardiovascular System: Scientific Foundations. Second edition. Raven Press, New York1992: 1505-1524Google Scholar), and because of the short time course of index ischemia, constant levels and unchanged activities in the enzymes of the Embden-Meyerhof pathway can be assumed. In accordance to these basic findings, we feel justified to perform our analysis of anaerobic glycolytic regulation in myocardium with an unchanged enzymatic composition and an essentially maintained tissue integrity prior to reperfusion. Thus, lactate accumulation could be used as a measure of anaerobic glycolytic flux. Comparisons of metabolite levels between groups were performed using ANOVA, for comparisons within groups repeated measures of ANOVA (Scheffé-test) was used. Analysis of variance was also employed to calculate regression differences. The obtained correlations were compared using the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Statistical differences were assumed at p values smaller than 0.05. At constant areas at risk (C, 17.2 ± 0.12%; IP, 15.8 ± 0.72%), IP limits infarct size (C, 90.0 ± 3.1 versus 5.05 ± 2.1%;p < 0.001). As ischemia in control animals proceed, anaerobic glycolytic flux is slowed down. In preconditioned myocardium, glycolytic flux is decreased at the onset of index ischemia, showing an even more pronounced deceleration during the subsequent phase (Fig. 2). Glycogen content at the onset of index ischemia did not differ between normal and IP myocardium (control, 99.0 ± 8.09 μmol of C6-units/g wet weight; IP, 96.2 ± 16.7). Myocardial metabolite contents are given in Table I.

Italic numbers indicate significant differences between control and IP myocardium. Glycogen is the source of glucose 6-phosphate during ischemia, so the reducing glycolytic flux corresponds to a reduced net flux through this potential substrate cycle. In control myocardium, Glu-1-P levels decrease as the net flux through the enzymes breaking down glycogen to Glu-1-P increases. The co-response (in the range −0.5 to −1) could easily be consistent with a slowing of this step by product inhibition of the glycogen phosphorylase and substrate activation of glycogen synthesizing reactions (UDP-glucose phosphatase/synthase). In IP myocardium, the decrease in flux for a given Glu-1-P level is significantly more pronounced. Because the graph for IP does not represent an extension of the graph for controls the altered flux:metabolite co-responses indicate changed biochemical properties of these enzymes. The myocardial contents in its co-substrate Pi and allosteric activator AMP only showed poor correlations (not significant) with glycolytic flux under control conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that they contributed to flux regulation at this level. Although there was a better formal correlation between Pi(p < 0.05) and AMP (not significant) following IP, decreases in Pi and AMP with increasing flux still do not seem sufficient to account for the change in enzyme activity observed. In control animals, the decrease in glycolytic flux during index ischemia is associated with an increase in the substrate (G1P) content of PGM. This occurs at basically stable levels in the product of PGM, Glu-6-P. These findings indicate that the observed inhibition of glycolytic flux during acute myocardial ischemia in control myocardium is not because of limited G1P availability. Substrate accumulation at increasing net flux, corresponding to a classical crossover effect, suggests a regulatory step downstream from the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, causing a passive increase in Glu-1-P. However, as changes in net flux were independent of Glu-6-P levels, product inhibition of PGM may not account for this alteration. Hence, other regulatory mechanisms must be considered. Moreover, the observation of decreasing substrate contents at stable product levels indicates that the displacement from equilibrium must be decreasing detectably during ischemia, even though this reaction is commonly viewed as close to equilibrium. Following IP, comparable increases in Glu-1-P content during ischemia were associated with even more inhibition of flux through PGM. Correspondingly, the correlation between flux inhibition and substrate accumulation shows a significantly steeper slope in IP myocardium. Moreover, the graph for preconditioned myocardium does not represent an extension of the correlation, which has been calculated for control myocardium. This altered correlation between PGM and changing substrate concentrations indicates a different kinetic behavior of this enzyme. Moreover, as substrate content changed independently of product levels, a shift in the PGM mass:action ratio also occurred in this case, although these shifts were in an opposite direction as observed in control myocardium. Also following IP, the decrease in glycolytic flux throughout index ischemia occurred at basically stable Glu-6-P levels. However, there was a significantly negative flux-Glu-6-P co-response. So although there was potentially an increase in product inhibition by Glu-6-P, it is doubtful whether it could counteract the larger increase in Glu-1-P. As a consequence, the kinetic response of this enzyme does not seem accounted for by the changes in its substrate and product according to classical substrate and product kinetics. Together with the fact that the response following IP is clearly different from that of controls, suggests that preconditioning has had an effect on this step by an unknown mechanism, reinforced by the fact that for a given Glu-1-P concentration the flux is much lower in IP hearts than in controls. In control myocardium, the decrease in flux through glucose-phosphate isomerase is only very weakly correlated to substrate content, and no significance can be attached to the co-response coefficient with glucose 6-phosphate. Hence, the behavior of this enzyme cannot be explained by substrate kinetics. However, as Fru-6-P content was increased at reduced flux levels, product inhibition may contribute to enzymatic regulation. As substrate levels change independently of product concentration, a changing mass:action ratio (closer to equilibrium) must be assumed for glucose-phosphate isomerase. In IP myocardium, the changes in substrate and product co-response coefficients are indicat"

Although the hematopoietic lineage is derived from the mesodermal germ layer in the embryo, recent data suggest that bone marrow cells with an antigenic profile consistent with that of hematopoietic stem cells can also differentiate to cell types of the endodermal lineages, such as hepatocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms associated with these events are entirely unknown. For decades, α-fetoprotein (AFP) has been used as a differentiation marker for endodermal cells, because it was thought that the transcription of AFP mRNA is tightly regulated in a developmental and tissue-specific process. In this report we describe two new variant forms of AFP transcripts in human hematopoietic progenitors that are not expressed in mature cells. The variant AFP (vAFP) cDNA sequences isolated from a multipotent hematopoietic cell line, K562, revealed that the vAFP differed from the authentic transcript, consisting of 15 exons, by replacing exon 1 of AFP with one or two exons located in the 5′-untranslated region of theAFP gene. In addition to the K562 cell line, vAFP transcripts were detected in normal bone marrow, thymus, and brain but were not detected in normal spleen, intestine, liver, or the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2. This suggests expression in normal hematopoietic progenitors. This hypothesis was confirmed by the finding that CD34+Lin− hematopoietic progenitor cells purified from cord blood by flow cytometric sorting also expressed the variant transcripts. These results suggest that some hematopoietic progenitors are in a state that permits them to express certain types of transcripts that have been considered unique to endoderm.

The molecular machinery of self-renewal and differentiation is one of most intriguing subjects of stem cell biology. Analyses of gene expression patterns using subtracted cDNA library or cDNA microarray techniques have revealed several candidates of new or known transcripts that are expressed exclusively in stem cell populations, but not in terminally differentiated cells (4Phillips R.L. Ernst R.E. Brunk B. Ivanova N. Mahan M.A. Deanehan J.K. Moore K.A. Overton G.C. Lemischka I.R. Science. 2000; 288: 1635-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar, 5Terskikh A.V.

These studies provide enormous information facilitating the development of approaches for understanding stem cells. However, the applied techniques have an intrinsic weakness in that they cannot detect the stem/progenitor cell-specific isoforms of transcripts having relatively long domains in common between the isoforms. Therefore, an alternative strategy is to analyze individual genes with expression that is regulated in developmentally specific ways in particular cell lineages. Cell differentiation in the developing embryo is regulated by extrinsic inductive signals and an intrinsic programmed genetic code. Differentiation into the three germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) from primitive ectoderm (epiblast) is a crucial step during development and thought to be an irreversible process. This leads to the development of unique cell types from each germ layer,e.g. epidermal or neuronal cells from ectoderm; epithelial cells in internal organs or digestive tract from endoderm; and hematopoietic and mesenchymal cells from mesoderm. Recent studies (6Bjornson C.R. Rietze R.L. Reynolds B.A. Magli M.C. Vescovi A.L. Science. 1999; 283: 534-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar,7Krause D.S. Theise N.D. Collector M.I.

A typical example of so-called “transdifferentiation” is that of murine bone marrow-derived ckithighThylowLin−Sca-1+cells giving rise to mature hepatocytes (8Lagasse E. Connors H., Al- Dhalimy M. Reitsma M. Dohse M. Osborne L. Wang X. Finegold M. Weissman I.L. Grompe M. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1229-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (2153) Google Scholar). This antigenic profile is used to define hematopoietic stem cells. Although reports about these examples of possible transdifferentiation in mammals are accumulating (9Morrison S.J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R7-R9Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether the studies observed transdifferentiation or identified more primitive progenitors than hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. In addition, recent reports proposed that spontaneous cell fusion between transplanted donor progenitors and recipient cells might cause misinterpretation in previous studies reported as possible transdifferentiation (10Terada N. Hamazaki T. Oka M. Hoki M. Mastalerz D.M. Nakano Y. Meyer E.M. Morel L. Petersen B.E. Scott E.W. Nature. 2002; 416: 542-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar, 11Ying Q.L. Nichols J. Evans E.P. Smith A.G. Nature. 2002; 416: 545-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). In any event, biochemical analyses are necessary for understanding multipotency of the cells not only in those experimental setting but in normal physiological environment. Adult liver parenchymal cells consist of hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. They are derived from common precursors, hepatoblasts, during embryonic development (12Kubota H. Reid L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12132-12137Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The bipotent progenitors originate from multipotent endodermal cells in the foregut by inductive signals from the septum transversum surrounding the outgrowth of the endoderm (13Zaret K. Curr. Opin. Genes Dev. 1998; 8: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it is not known whether the bone marrow-derived cells can differentiate into hepatoblasts or can convert directly to hepatocytes, the cells possessing potential for hepatic differentiation should express some early endodermal markers before full differentiation into hepatocytes. One such marker is α-fetoprotein (AFP),1 which is a major serum protein produced primarily by visceral endoderm of the yolk sac and by hepatoblasts as well as more differentiated fetal hepatic cells (14Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen H. Egan J.O. Chiu J.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 11-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). AFP is one of the earliest markers for endodermal differentiation; the transcriptional expression starts with the appearance of visceral endoderm in the early embryo and is regulated tightly by developmental and tissue-specific cues (14Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen H. Egan J.O. Chiu J.F. Crit. Rev.

Science. 1987; 235: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, in most studies that assess endodermal differentiation of human embryonic stem cells or embryonic germ cells, the expression of AFP transcripts or the products have been used as a marker of endoderm (17Thomson J.A.

In this study, we have identified two variant forms of human AFP transcripts from a multipotent hematopoietic cell line, K562. The cDNA sequences revealed that the differences in the variant AFP (vAFP) mRNAs from that of the authentic transcript, which consists of 15 exons, is the presence of one or two unique exons, named exon A and exon B, replacing exon 1 of AFP. The variant forms were detected in normal CD34+Lin− hematopoietic progenitor cells but not in mature blood cells. The expression of the variant AFP transcripts suggests that hematopoietic progenitors are in a state that permits them to express certain types of transcripts that have been considered unique to the endoderm. The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, was maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm MEM non-essential amino acids solution, 5 μg/ml insulin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The human erythroleukemia cell line, K562 was maintained in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 × 10−5m2-mercaptoethanol and 10% fetal bovine serum. HepG2 and K562 were obtained from the Tissue Culture Core Facility of the Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Normal human fetal lung fibroblasts, MRC5 (American Type Culture Collection), were cultured in the same supplemented DMEM/F12 in the presence of 10% horse serum (Sigma) and 1 ng/ml of bovine FGF-2 (Collaborative Biomedical Research). The primer sequences used for PCR are shown in Table I. For reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR), total RNAs were extracted from various cell lines and subjected to cDNA synthesis. Briefly, cDNAs were synthesized from 10 μg of total RNAs by oligo(dT) priming and AMV reverse transcriptase (Seikagaku) in a reaction volume of 20 μl at 42 °C. PCR was performed in a total volume of 50 μl consisting of 1 μm each primer, 200 μm each dNTP, 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10 mm TrisHCl, pH 8.3, and 1.25 units of Amplitaq polymerase gold (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with synthesized cDNA. Samples were heated to 94 °C for 3 min followed by amplification for 30 cycles for AFP or 35 cycles for vAFP of 2 min at 94 °C, 2 min 62 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. After the last cycle, a final extension step was done at 72 °C for 6 min. Then 5 μl of each PCR reaction were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. For nested RT-PCR of AFP or vAFP in various human tissues, one-fourth of the cDNA synthesized from 10 μg of total RNAs (CLONTECH) were used for the first PCR. One-hundredth of the volume of the first PCR product was applied for nested PCR using an internal primer set. The PCR consisted of 1 cycle of 3 min at 95 °C; 30 cycles of 1.7 min at 95 °C, 2 min at 62 °C, 1.5 min at 72 °C followed by a 4.5 min extension at 72 °C. Then, 5 μl of each sample were analyzed in 2% agarose gels. For RT-PCR of sorted cells from human umbilical cord blood cells, total RNA was isolated with RNeasy kit (Qiagen). cDNAs synthesized from total RNAs of sorted cells were normalized by the cell number. Nested PCR for vAFP was performed with cDNA equivalent to 48,000 cells. Single step RT-PCR for β-actin or CD34 was done with cDNA equivalent to that of 1000 cells. For analysis of the genomic sequence of exon A, genomic DNAs were isolated from HepG2, K562, and MRC5 with QIAamp Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Amplified PCR products, using g-ex-AS and g-ex-AA primers (Table I), were cloned into pCRII-TOPO (Invitrogen), and the DNA sequences were determined by the DNA sequencing core facility of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (Dr. Laura Livingston, director).Table IPrimer sequences used in this study Open table in a new tab The rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method (14Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar) was performed with modifications to identify the 5′-end of the vAFP transcripts. Briefly, with terminal transferase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a poly(dG) tail sequence was introduced into K562 cDNA derived from 10 μg of total RNA. One-tenth volume of the cDNA was amplified for the first 5 cycles with 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, followed by 15 cycles with 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min using SN-poly(C) primer and ex-2A, ex-3A, or ex-4A. PCR products purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) were reamplified with SN primer and an internal AFP primer (ex-1A, ex-2A, or ex-3A) at 94 °C for 1 min, 62 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2.5 min for 30 cycles. The final PCR products were cloned into pCRII-TOPO and sequenced. Human UCB was obtained from the Carolina Cord Blood Bank following institutional review board-approved informed consent. UCB was processed as described (27Storms R.W. Goodell M.A. Fisher A. Mulligan R.C. Smith C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfractionated nucleated UCB cells were prepared by deleting red blood cells with the use of Hespan (DuPont Pharma, Wilmington, CE) and hemolysis at 37 °C in 0.17 m NH4Cl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 200 μm EDTA. Lineage-committed cells were removed from the unfractionated cells using the StemSep enrichment system (progenitor mixture, StemCell Technologies Inc, Vancouver, British Columbia). The recovered cells were termed Lin− UCB cells. Cells were purified using a FACStar Plus cell sorter (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems (BDIS), San Jose, CA). For cell sorting, the Lin− UCB cells were stained with a mixture of three phycoerythrin (PE) conjugated CD34-specific antibodies (clones Qbend10, Immu133 and Immu409, Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL). For all cell sorting, (7-aminoactinomycin D (Molecular Probes; 7AAD) was used to exclude dying cells. This was added to a final concentration of 10 μg/ml during the antibody incubations. In some instances, the expression of CD38 was also monitored (clone HB7, BDIS). The human AFP gene consists of 15 exons (Fig. 1 A). The coding sequence is from exon 1 to exon 14 (20). To investigate the expression of possible variant forms of AFP mRNA in hematopoietic cells, two different portions of the AFP cDNA sequence were selected as target sequences of RT-PCR. The primer combination of ex-1S and ex-3A was used to amplify exon 1 containing the initiation methionine to exon 3, and the combination of ex-12S and ex-14A was used to amplify exon 12 to exon 14 containing the termination codon (Fig. 1 B). The results of the PCR are shown in Fig.2 A. Both combinations of the primers resulted in intense amplification bands in the cDNA from HepG2, a hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (lanes 1 and2). By contrast, cDNA from the erythroleukemia cell line, K562, showed an amplification band only for the C-terminal portion, identified by the ex-12S and ex-14A (lane 5) whereas there was no band by PCR of the primer combination of ex-1S and ex-3A (lane 4). This result suggests that K562 expresses a short form of authentic AFP transcript without the N terminus. In fact, the result of the PCR for the whole coding region of AFP using ex-1S and ex-14A primers showed that the single band of 1.8 kb (lane 3) was amplified from the HepG2 cDNA, whereas there was no detectable band in K562 (lane 6).Figure 2Expression of AFP mRNAs in K562 and HepG2 was analyzed by RT-PCR. A, primer combination of ex-1S and ex-3A (lanes 1, 4, and 7), ex-12S and ex-14A (lanes 2, 5, and 8), or ex-1S and ex-14S (lanes 3, 6, and 9) was used to amplify exon 1 to exon 3, exon 12 to exon 14, or exon 1 to exon 14 of AFP cDNA, respectively.

Chem. 1987; 262: 12479-12487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although there has been no report about any variant form of the AFP mRNA in humans, several short forms of the AFP transcript have been characterized in rats (23Lemire J.M. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4656-4664PubMed Google Scholar, 24Watanabe T. Jimenez-Molina J.L. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The rat vAFP lacks the first six or seven exons, but shares common 3′-sequences containing the seventh or eighth exon to the fifteenth exon, respectively (23Lemire J.M. Fausto N. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 4656-4664PubMed Google Scholar). Detailed analysis of one variant form of rat showed that the rat vAFP used an additional exon, designated as exon V that is located in the seventh intron of the rat gene, as the first exon of the variant form. However, it turned out that human vAFP transcripts in K562 had different structures from the rat vAFP because RT-PCR of the primer combination exon 7 and ex-14A could detect the variant transcripts (data not show). Therefore, a series of 5′-primers from exon 2 to exon 6 were constructed (Fig.1 B) to see the difference between authentic and variant forms of AFP transcripts in K562. With each of these, ex-14A primer was used as a 3′-primer. The results of the RT-PCR showed, intriguingly, that human variant AFP transcripts in hematopoietic cells share the entire coding exons, except for exon 1, in the authentic form that is expressed in HepG2 (Fig. 2 B). Recently, it has been reported that an AFP isoform using a new exon located in intron 1 is expressed preferentially in the yolk sac and fetal liver in the mouse (25Scohy S. Gabant P. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no detectable amplified band in the PCR using an intron 1-specific 5′-primer (data not shown) suggested that the human vAFP transcripts in hematopoietic cells are novel isoforms of AFP. To determine the sequences of the 5′-end of the vAFP transcript in K562, the RACE method was applied as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As a result, two types of variant transcripts were identified. The sequences are shown in Fig. 3 A. Comparing the sequences of the variant transcripts to the GenBankTMdata base, two regions of genomic sequence of the human AFPgene were identified. One type (type A) of the variant forms used an additional exon, designated as exon A, located about 5 kb upstream from exon 1 (Fig. 3 B). The other type (type AB) used exon A in conjunction with another exon, designated as exon B, located about 1.6 kb upstream from exon 1 (Fig.3 B). Among 19 clones analyzed in these experiments, 15 clones were type A; 3 clones were type AB; and one clone was the germ line transcript of intron 1. Although the genomic sequences containing exon A were reported originally from Watanabe et al. (26Watanabe K. Saito A. Tamaoki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4812-4818Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), some nucleotides in the exon A of K562 differed from the genomic sequence (Fig. 3 A, underline). First, to determine whether this difference arose from artifacts associated with the anchored PCR technique, the genomic sequence of exon A in K562 cells was compared with the cloned cDNA sequence. This showed that the cDNA and genomic DNA of K562 cells were identical (data not shown). Next, to determine whether the genomic sequence of exon A of K562 is specific for the cell line, the genomic sequence of HepG2 and normal human fibroblasts, MRC5, was compared with that of K562. The results indicated no difference in the genomic sequence from all three sources, K562, HepG2, and MRC5 (data not shown). In addition, the genomic DNA sequence on the AFP locus from the data base of the human genome project (GenBankTM; accession no. AP002825) corresponded with the sequences of K562. These results suggest that the DNA sequence of exon A cloned from K562 does not include artifacts from the PCR cloning. The expression pattern of the variant and authentic transcripts of AFP was studied in K562 and HepG2. A sense primer of exon A for RT-PCR was designed. The combination of the exon A primer, ex-AS, and exon 14 primer, ex-14A, successfully detected the transcripts in K562, but not HepG2 (Fig. 3 C). The amplified products from K562 were cloned and sequenced. As expected, the two types of variant AFP transcripts either using both exons A and B or exon A alone were followed by exon 2 to exon 14. The number of clones with a type A sequence was 7 of 12, while that of type AB clone was 5 of 12 (data not shown). This suggests that the two types of vAFP are expressed equally in K562. The far stronger signal of HepG2 by RT-PCR using ex-2S and ex-14A indicated that HepG2 expressed the authentic form only. This result demonstrated clearly that the expression pattern of variant and authentic forms of AFP rigorously discriminates between K562 and HepG2 cells. We next examined whether the variant transcripts of AFP are expressed in normal cells. Since we anticipated the expression in normal cells would be at very low levels, a nested (two step) RT-PCR was performed. The first PCR was performed with primers, ex-A1S and ex-14A, to amplify the whole coding sequence of variant forms. Subsequently, nested PCR was performed by an internal primer combination, ex-A2S and ex-3A, which can distinguish between the presence of type A and type AB by the molecular size (Fig. 4 A). The PCR results indicate that the tissue distribution of the vAFP transcripts is fairly restricted. Only primary hematopoietic organs, bone marrow (lane 1) and thymus (lane 2), and brain (lane 7) expressed the transcripts. Other tissues, including liver, lung, trachea, kidney, stomach, small intestine, colon, heart, and spleen, did not have cells expressing vAFP. These results strongly suggest that hematopoietic progenitors, but not mature blood cells, express vAFP, because the spleen is a secondary hematopoietic organ in which hemato-lymphopoiesis does not take place under normal physiological conditions. In addition, cDNA from peripheral blood cells (CLONTECH) never showed the expression of vAFP (data not shown). On the other hand, authentic AFP was detected in brain, kidney, small intestine, and thymus, but not in bone marrow. No expression in normal human fetal fibroblasts (lane 13) or small intestine (lane 4) suggests that the vAFP expression is not associated simply with cell proliferation. The RT-PCR of tissue RNAs cannot define which cells express the variant forms of AFP transcripts. Bone marrow and thymus consist of a very heterogeneous cell population. Therefore, we studied purified hematopoietic progenitors from UCB by flow cytometric sorting to learn whether or not they express vAFP. Unfractionated nucleated cells in UCB contain only small numbers of CD34+ cells (Fig. 5 A) in which hematopoietic progenitors are highly enriched (27Storms R.W. Goodell M.A. Fisher A. Mulligan R.C. Smith C. Blood. 2000; 96: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CD34+ UCB cells could be enriched after removing Lin-positive cells (Fig. 5 A). Both live (7AAD−), unfractionated cells and CD34+Lin− cells were isolated by flow cytometric sorting, and the RNAs extracted were subjected to nested PCR for vAFP. A total of four different cord bloods were tested. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the expression of vAFP transcripts was detected in CD34+Lin− cells, enriched hematopoietic progenitors (lanes 2, 4, 6, and8; 4 of 4), but not in unfractionated cord blood cells (lanes 1, 3, and 5; 3 of 4). Cloning and DNA sequencing experiments showed that the amplified bands corresponded to cDNA sequences of type A and type AB from K562 cells (data not shown). CD34 expression in the sorted CD34+Lin− cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig.5 B). The present study identified two variant forms of AFP expressed preferentially in hematopoietic progenitors, but not in mature blood cells or in hepatic cells. These results suggest that the AFP gene locus of chromatin in hematopoietic progenitors is open and accessible to transcription factors for the mRNA expression. In other words, chromatin-related repression of authentic AFP, which is a mechanism that will block inappropriate expression of authentic AFP in non-hepatic cells (28Crowe A.J. Sang L., Li, K.K. Lee K.C. Spear B.T. Barton M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25113-25120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), is incomplete in hematopoietic progenitors and allows vAFP to be transcribed. In the case of K562, strictly speaking, very small amounts of authentic AFP transcripts could be detected when cycles of RT-PCR were increased (Fig. 4 B, lane 14). This indicates that K562 express vAFP at a much higher level than authentic AFP. Conversely, vAFP could be detected in HepG2 by increasing cycles of RT-PCR (data not shown). Therefore, our data derived from the cell lines suggest that three types of patterns are present with respect to the authentic and variant transcripts of AFP. Hepatic cells (HepG2) express authentic AFP dominantly, while hematopoietic cells (K562) express vAFP dominantly. Fibroblasts (MRC5) express neither authentic AFP nor vAFP. This prompts us to ask two questions with respect to AFP expression. 1) What is the mechanism of the opening of the AFP locus in the chromatin, giving rise to whichever of the transcripts is expressed? 2) What is the transcriptional machinery associated with the different transcripts? The mouse has proved an excellent model system for studying tissue-specific and developmentally regulated transcriptional control of authentic AFP in vivo as well as in vitro(14Tilghman S.M. Oxf. Surv. Eukaryotic Genes. 1985; 2: 160-206PubMed Google Scholar, 15Chen H. Egan J.O. Chiu J.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 11-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 16Hammer R.E. Krumlauf R. Camper S.A. Brinster R.L. Tilghman S.M. Science. 1987; 235: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have established that the transcriptional control of the AFP gene is mediated by five cis-acting regulatory domains, including the AFP promoter, three distinct enhancer elements, and one repressor region located between the AFP promoter and the upstream enhancers (reviewed in Ref. 29Spear B.T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). There are a number of transcription factors binding to the promotor region to control the expression of the authentic AFP form (reviewed in Ref. 29Spear B.T. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1999; 9: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that GATA factors, especially GATA4, could be a master gene for endodermal differentiation (30Zaret K. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and for the expression of fetoprotein transcription factor, which activates AFP expression in early liver development (31Pare J.F. Roy S. Galarneau L. Belanger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13136-13144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). On the other hand, other GATA factors are key regulators for hematopoiesis (32Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Interestingly, several possible GATA family binding sites were identified in the exon A genomic sequence as well as other transcription factor binding sites associated with hematopoiesis such as AML-1 (33Okuda T. van Deursen J. Hiebert S.W. Grosveld G. Downing J.R. Cell. 1996; 84: 321-330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1613) Google Scholar) and MZF-1 (34Morris J.F. Rauscher 3rd, F.J. Davis B. Klemsz M., Xu, D. Tenen D. Hromas R. Blood. 1995; 86: 3640-3647PubMed Google Scholar). Because exon A was identified as only one 5′-end of two variant forms by our RACE method in all independent clones, exon A is possibly the first exon of vAFP in K562. Thus, it is noteworthy to see whether these transcription factors expressed in hematopoietic progenitors are involved in the transcription of vAFP. However, the transcriptional start site of the variant forms of AFP in hematopoietic cells remains to be determined. Although extensive research has been performed to elucidateAFP gene regulation in various species (15Chen H. Egan J.O. Chiu J.F. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 11-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Lazarevich N.L. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 117-133PubMed Google Scholar), there has been no report about human variant AFP transcripts nor identification of exon A and exon B 5′-upstream of exon 1 in any species. Variant AFP transcripts identified in rodents were expressed preferentially in hepatic or yolk sac cells (24Watanabe T. Jimenez-Molina J.L. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Scohy S. Gabant P. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These suggest that the vAFP transcripts in the human hematopoietic cells are different from ones identified in rat or in mouse not only in their molecular structures, but also in their expression pattern. Interestingly, all variant forms of AFP reported in the previous studies and this study use unique first exons. Because the different usage of the first exon suggests that the vAFP expression is dependent on a unique promotor (24Watanabe T. Jimenez-Molina J.L. Chou J.Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 648-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 25Scohy S. Gabant P. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 3743-3751Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further studies are required to elucidate the hematopoietic cell-specific promotor of vAFP. At present, apart from the hematopoietic organs, the brain is the only tissue where vAFP expression is observed. It has been shown that cultured neurospheres, which are considered as neural stem cells, isolated from the anterior portion of the lateral wall of the lateral ventricles in adult mice were able to differentiate to endodermal cells (36Clarke D.L. Johansson C.B. Wilbertz J. Veress B. Nilsson E. Karlstrom H. Lendahl U. Frisen J. Science. 2000; 288: 1660-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to determine the identity of vAFP+ cells in the brain and isolate them from brain tissue in order to ask whether they have a capability to form neurospheresin vitro. The expression of vAFP in non-endodermal cells may represent a unique immature state, which has the developmental potential of endodermal cells. The function of the vAFP is unclear because the amount of mRNA was extremely low, and no protein products were ever found in assays using immunohistochemistry with anti-AFP antibodies on hematopoietic progenitors. 2N. Moss and H. Kubota, unpublished observations. In addition, there is no long open reading frame starts in exon A or B to connect with exon 2 of authentic AFP if only ATG is considered as an initiation codon. In that case, a possible initiation codon at exon 3 would be used for the translation so that the translated product from vAFP transcripts would be a truncated form. However, because there is TTG and CTG in exon B to connect the open reading frame of exon 2, it might be possible for one of them to work as an alternative initiation codon (37Hann S.R. King M.W. Bentley D.L. Anderson C.W. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1988; 52: 185-195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 38Prats H. Kaghad M. Prats A.C. Klagsbrun M. Lelias J.M. Liauzun P.

In any event, further studies are required to elucidate the possible functions of vAFP transcripts. As a final point, this study raises a warning about the use of RT-PCR techniques for the detection of AFP mRNA. AFP is used commonly as a molecular marker for endodermal differentiation (17Thomson J.A. Itskovitz-Eldor J. Shapiro S.S. Waknitz M.A. Swiergiel J.J. Marshall V.S. Jones J.M.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1997; 7: 11-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 35Lazarevich N.L. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2000; 65: 117-133PubMed Google Scholar). Various RT-PCR techniques have been developed for the detection of circulating carcinoma cells in peripheral blood (39Paterlini-Brechot P. Vona G. Brechot C. Semin. Cancer Biol. 2000; 10: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, none of them, to the best of our knowledge, used exon 1-specific primers to detect the authentic form of AFP. Thus, the use of not only the exon 1-specific primer but the exon A-specific primer for RT-PCR to analyze AFP mRNA expression will be necessary to consider which types of transcripts are expressed in the cells examined. In conclusion, this is the first study in which variant forms of an endodermal marker, AFP, have been found, with a selective pattern of expression in human hematopoietic progenitors. Our results suggest that the expression of vAFP transcripts may reflect the ability of progenitors for hematopoietic cells to differentiate to endodermal cells and provides a unique opportunity for studying the mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2006572230,"We investigated the interacting surface between a short curarimimetic toxin and a muscular-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, looking for the ability of various biotinylated Naja nigricollis α-neurotoxin analogues to bind simultaneously the receptor and streptavidin. All these derivatives, modified at positions 10 (loop I), 27, 30, 33, 35 (loop II), 46, and 47 (loop III) or the N-terminal (erabutoxin numbering), still shared high affinity for the receptor, and in the absence of receptor they all bound soluble streptavidin. However, the proportion of the toxin-receptor complex that bound to streptavidin-coated beads, varied both with the location of the modification and with the length of the linker between biotin and the toxin. In the receptor-toxin complex, the concave side of loops II and III was not accessible to streptavidin, unlike the N terminus of the toxin and, to a certain extent, loop I. On the convex face, loop III was the most accessible, whereas the tip of loop II, especially Arg-30, seemed to be closer to the receptor. The present data demonstrate that short toxins neither penetrate deeply into a crevice as proposed earlier nor lie parallel to the receptor extracellular wall. These data also suggest that they may not lie strictly perpendicular to the cylindrical wall of the receptor. These results fit nicely with three-dimensional models of interaction between long neurotoxins and their receptors and support the idea that short and long curarimimetic toxins share a similar overall topology of interaction when bound to nicotinic receptors. We investigated the interacting surface between a short curarimimetic toxin and a muscular-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, looking for the ability of various biotinylated Naja nigricollis α-neurotoxin analogues to bind simultaneously the receptor and streptavidin.

However, the proportion of the toxin-receptor complex that bound to streptavidin-coated beads, varied both with the location of the modification and with the length of the linker between biotin and the toxin. In the receptor-toxin complex, the concave side of loops II and III was not accessible to streptavidin, unlike the N terminus of the toxin and, to a certain extent, loop I. On the convex face, loop III was the most accessible, whereas the tip of loop II, especially Arg-30, seemed to be closer to the receptor. The present data demonstrate that short toxins neither penetrate deeply into a crevice as proposed earlier nor lie parallel to the receptor extracellular wall. These data also suggest that they may not lie strictly perpendicular to the cylindrical wall of the receptor. These results fit nicely with three-dimensional models of interaction between long neurotoxins and their receptors and support the idea that short and long curarimimetic toxins share a similar overall topology of interaction when bound to nicotinic receptors. acetylcholine-binding protein nicotinic acetylcholine receptor high performance liquid chromatography analogue Q10C of N. nigricollis α-neurotoxin modified on Cys-10 withN-(biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoacetyl)ethylenediamine (the same convention has been used for the other cysteine analogues) analogue Q10C of N. nigricollisα-neurotoxin modified on Cys-10 withN-biotinoyl-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl)hydrazide (the same convention has been used for the other cysteine analogues) K47C analogue of N. nigricollis α-neurotoxin modified on Cys-47 withN-[3H]ethylmaleimide and on the N terminus with biotinamidocaproate The recent resolution of the structure of an acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP)1 by Brejcet al.

These studies positioned the long-chain curarimimetic toxins equatorially on the outside face of the cylinder formed by the five receptor subunits, almost perpendicularly to the cylinder wall, with loop III of the toxins looking “downward” to the membrane (in the case of nAChR). These long neurotoxins insert the tip of their second loop in the acetylcholine-binding site, explaining their antagonistic properties. In two models (2Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M.

It has been hypothesized that the AChBP might have been crystallized in a frozen “desensitized” state (5Grutter T. Changeux J.-P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 459-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and that the resting state could require a reorganization of the quaternary structure of the receptor. Because it has been suggested that curarimimetic toxins stabilize the resting state of the receptor (6Oswald R.E. Changeux J.-P.

Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and that they establish interactions with distinct amino acids of nAChR (10Spura A. Riel R.U.

Servent D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3216-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). It has even been postulated that the passage entered by the short toxin is a narrow gorge (13Saez-Briones P. Krauss M. Dreger M. Herrmann A. Tsetlin V.I. Hucho F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 265: 902-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Such a crevice is not visible on the structure of the AChBP homooligomer but might exist in the resting state of the nAChR heterooligomer. To investigate whether short toxins bind differently from long toxins, we explored the accessibility of the two faces of a typical short neurotoxin free and complexed to theTorpedo acetylcholine receptor, drawing inspiration from the earlier work of Lobel et al. (15Lobel P. Kao P. Birken S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10605-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who tested the ability of various biotinylcobratoxin-nAChR complexes to bind avidin.For this purpose, we synthesized various “cysteine analogues” of the toxin and coupled them to two different biotin derivatives, leading to a maximal distance of 11.5 and 16.5 Å, respectively, between the carbonyl function of biotin (coming from its carboxylic moiety) and the α-carbon of the modified cysteine. We checked that these derivatives bind independently to Torpedo nAChR and to streptavidin and looked for the ability of the binary biotinyltoxin-nAChR complex to be retained by streptavidin-coated beads. Our data demonstrate that a short-chain neurotoxin does not bind to TorpedonAChR parallel to the receptor extracellular wall nor does it penetrate into a deep crevice. These data also suggest that they may not lie strictly perpendicular to the cylindrical wall of the receptor. All these features are globally comparable to those anticipated from three-dimensional models of interaction of long neurotoxins to their receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFor the sake of clarity, we decided to use erabutoxin numbering for the amino acids of Naja nigricollis α-neurotoxin as we did in a previous report (18Michalet S. Teixeira F. Gilquin B. Mourier G. Servent D. Drevet P. Binder P. Tzartos S. Ménez A. Kessler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25608-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar).MaterialsN-(Biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoacetyl)ethylenediamine was from Molecular Probes.N-Biotinoyl-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl)hydrazide, succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate and soluble streptavidin were from Sigma Chemical Co. Streptavidin-coated beads (Dynabeads M280) were from Dynal. α-125I-Bungarotoxin (150–250 Ci·mmol−1) was from Amersham Biosciences. LiveTorpedo marmorata were from the Station Biologique d'Arcachon (France). Electrospray mass spectrometry was carried out using a Quattro II spectrometer from Micromass. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Jobin Yvon CD6 discograph at 22 °C. Radioactivity was determined on a 1261-multigamma counter (AmershamBiosciences).HPLC ConditionsReverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separations were performed using a Vydac C4 semi-preparative column (10 × 250 mm; flow rate, 4 ml·min−1; linear gradient, 5% to 18% B in 6 min, then 18% to 24% B in 19 min (A, H2O-0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; B, CH3CN)). Gel filtration experiments were carried out with a TosoHaas TSK-Gel G2000 SWXL column (7.8 × 300 mm; flow rate, 1 ml·min−1; 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5).Membrane PreparationsnAChR-rich membranes from the electric tissue of T. marmorata were prepared as described previously (16Saitoh T. Oswald R. Wennogle L.D. Changeux J.P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 116: 30-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The concentration of acetylcholine-binding sites was measured at equilibrium with α-125I-bungarotoxin (17Schmidt J. Raftery M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 52: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar).Synthesis of Biotinyltoxin DerivativesN. nigricollis α-toxin analogues (Q10C, K27C, R30C, R33C, T35C, V46C, and K47C) were synthesized as described earlier (18Michalet S. Teixeira F. Gilquin B. Mourier G. Servent D. Drevet P. Binder P. Tzartos S. Ménez A. Kessler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25608-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The structure of the refolded toxins was checked by electrospray mass spectrometry and circular dichroism. Each “cysteine analogue” (60 nmol in 50–300 μl of water) was then biotinylated on the single free cysteine withN-(biotinoyl)-N′-(iodoacetyl)ethylenediamine (5 μl of a 20 mm solution in Me2SO) buffered with 1 m Tris/HCl at pH 8 (50 μl) or withN-(biotinoyl)-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl)hydrazide (5 μl of a 20 mm solution in Me2SO) buffered with 0.5 m Tris/HCl at pH 6.8 (50 μl), at room temperature for 1.5 h. For the N-terminal biotinyltoxin ([3H]Nter-Biot-K47C-NEM), after automated solid-phase peptide synthesis of K47C, the resin (190 mg) was taken up inN-methylpyrrolidone and reacted with succinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (10 equivalents) in the presence of diisopropylethylamine (10 equivalents) for 24 h at room temperature. The resin was washed withN-methylpyrrolidone (3 × 10 ml), then dichloromethane (1 × 10 ml), and finally with methanol (1 × 10 ml) and dried, before classic deprotection and refolding of the peptide was carried out. Each biotinyltoxin derivative was purified by reverse-phase HPLC, as described above, and checked by electrospray mass spectrometry.Binding AssaysCompetition experiments were performed as described earlier (18Michalet S. Teixeira F. Gilquin B. Mourier G. Servent D. Drevet P. Binder P. Tzartos S. Ménez A. Kessler P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25608-25615Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except for the receptor concentration, which was increased to 0.7 nm. α-125I-Bungarotoxin was used as the radioactive tracer, and equilibrium dissociation constants were determined according to Cheng and Prusoff (19Cheng Y.C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12178) Google Scholar).Interaction of Biotinyltoxin Derivatives with Soluble StreptavidinEach biotinyltoxin (5 nmol) was mixed with one equivalent of soluble streptavidin for 1.5 h at room temperature (50–100 μm final concentration). The mixture was then injected onto a TosoHaas TSK-G2000-SWXL gel-filtration column equilibrated with 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, as described above. The concentrations of toxin and streptavidin were chosen to allow UV detection of the toxin on HPLC but also to match as best as possible the concentration of streptavidin used later when making the ternary complexes between the receptor, the biotinyltoxins, and the streptavidin-coated beads (16–22 μm).Interaction of the Binary nAChR-Biotinyltoxin Complexes with the Streptavidin-coated BeadsTorpedo membranes (390 pmol of toxin-binding sites) were incubated for 2 h, at room temperature, with an aliquot of α-125I-bungarotoxin (a concentration of labeled toxin was used to occupy 2.5% of the α-bungarotoxin-binding sites) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5 (400-μl final volume), containing 3 mm EDTA and 1 mm EGTA (buffer A). After centrifugation (15 min, 4 °C, 21,913 × g), the supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed three times with buffer A to eliminate radioactive impurities that did not bind to the receptor (commonly 30% of the radioactivity for purchased α-125I-bungarotoxin). The membranes were then solubilized in 1.2 ml of 10 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm NaCl, 1% Triton (buffer B), and centrifuged as described above. Aliquots of the supernatant (5 pmol of toxin-binding sites) were then incubated with each biotinyltoxin (20 pmol, 45-μl final volume) for 30 min. Before use, magnetic streptavidin-coated beads (110 μl, 6.5–9 nmol/ml) were washed three times with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, containing 50 mm NaCl and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (200 μl) and twice with buffer B (200 μl). The solutions containing the nAChR-biotinyltoxin complexes were mixed individually with the beads. After 30 min, the supernatants were removed and the beads were washed three times with buffer B. Finally, the amount of receptor bound to the beads was determined by γ-counting of the α-125I-bungarotoxin.DISCUSSIONExperimental data showed that short and long neurotoxins do not have identical binding determinants (9Antil S. Servent D. Ménez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34851-34858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) but do establish interactions with distinct amino acids on the nAChR (10Spura A. Riel R.U. Freedman N.D. Agrawal S. Seto C. Hawrot E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22452-22460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Photolabeling experiments suggested that short neurotoxins penetrate into a deep crevice of the nAChR (11Machold J. Utkin Y. Kirsch D. Kaufmann R. Tsetlin V. Hucho F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7282-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 12Hucho F. Tsetlin V.I. Machold J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 13Saez-Briones P.

Ed. 2001; 40: 3101-3116Crossref Google Scholar), whereas recent three-dimensional models of long α-neurotoxins complexed to their receptors showed that only the tip of the central loop of the toxins penetrates into the receptor (2Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M. Balass M. Fridkin M. Smit A.B. Brejc K. Sixma T.K. Katchalski-Katzir E. Sussman J.L. Fuchs S.

Servent D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3216-3221Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine the binding orientation of short neurotoxins and their penetration into the nAChR, we studied the ability of various biotinyltoxin derivatives to make a ternary complex with nAChR and streptavidin. We probed various positions (i) on the concave side of a typical short toxin and known to be involved in the nAChR-binding site (10, 27, 33, and 47), (ii) on the convex side (30, 35, and 46), and (iii) on the “top” of the molecule (N-ter) (Fig. 1). Therefore, we prepared 15 biotinyltoxin derivatives from chemically engineered cysteine analogues of a short neurotoxin, introducing a single biotin moiety at the mentioned positions and using three linkers of 10, 11.5, and 16.5 Å in length. Because all our derivatives could bind separately to streptavidin and nAChR, the lack of formation of a ternary complex between streptavidin and the toxin-nAChR complex was likely to reflect the inaccessibility of biotin to the tetramer of streptavidin, attributable to steric hindrance due to the presence of the nAChR.Like Long Neurotoxins, Short Neurotoxins Do Not Penetrate into a Deep CreviceWe showed that the convex side of loop III of receptor-bound toxin remained quite accessible to the bulky tetramer of streptavidin (67 kDa), because the biotinyltoxin with the 11.5-Å-long linker on position 46 could make the ternary complex, although less efficiently than with the longest linker (Fig. 4). Interestingly, with the latter, we obtained opposite results for positions 46 and 47, the first facing the convex side (efficient binding) and the other facing the concave side (no binding) of the toxin. These data could be compared with previous results on Lys-49-modified α-cobratoxin (equivalent to Lys-47 in our short toxin), which was able to make the ternary complex but with a diminished ability (15Lobel P. Kao P. Birken S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10605-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lobel et al. (15Lobel P. Kao P. Birken S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10605-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) concluded that the ternary complex was strained. The slight discrepancy obtained between these studies, for equivalent positions, might be due to the difference in length of the linkers separating biotin from the toxin or to slight differences in the binding orientation of the toxins. However, all data demonstrate that the convex face of loop III is much more accessible to the bulky tetrameric streptavidin than its concave side and that, as for long neurotoxins, loop III does not penetrate at all into the receptor. The T35C-Biot16.5 derivative was one of the most efficient probes in our ternary complex formation experiments. Considering the position of Thr-35 on the toxin, this result demonstrates that, if the toxin penetrates into the receptor, only the tip of loop II is able to do it. This conclusion is depicted in Fig. 5, in which the biotinyl carboxylate was positioned at 16.5 Å from the α-carbon of Cys-35, in the direction of the “top” of the toxin (in the opposite direction from the putative receptor-penetrating area of the toxin). The less cumbersome region of streptavidin was oriented toward the putative receptor-penetrating area of the toxin (“bottom” of the molecule), and streptavidin was positioned to avoid most clashes with the toxin. Although this figure is a simple illustration, it explains why only the tip of the second loop of the short toxin may penetrate into the receptor (to give an idea of the receptor surface, the backbone of AChBP was drawn in colored ribbons beside the toxin/streptavidin pair). Therefore, this result does not support the earlier proposition, based on photoaffinity labeling, that short toxins penetrate into a deep crevice of the receptor (11Machold J. Utkin Y. Kirsch D.

Ed. 2001; 40: 3101-3116Crossref Google Scholar).Like Long Neurotoxins, Short Neurotoxins Do Not Bind Parallel to the Receptor SurfacePrevious site-directed mutagenesis of erabutoxin-a (20Trémeau O.

Chem. 1993; 268: 909-916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that only concave-side residues of short neurotoxins are critical for binding to nAChR. Such a result could be interpreted as a demonstration that their convex face is fully accessible to the solvent and that the bound toxins lie more or less parallel to the receptor surface, orienting their concave face toward the nAChR. If this is the case, all the convex-modified biotinyltoxins would be expected to bind streptavidin and nAChR simultaneously independent of the length of the linker between the toxin and biotin. Clearly this is not the case, because the derivatives with the 11.5-Å-long linker on the convex side cannot make the ternary complex with streptavidin and nAChR. Moreover, the N-terminal-modified toxin is one of the most efficient probes, although it harbors the shortest linker. A similar result was obtained with the long α-cobratoxin modified on Lys-12 (15Lobel P. Kao P. Birken S. Karlin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10605-10612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our result is also in agreement with the observation that a monoclonal antibody (Mα1) can interact with an epitope located around the toxin N terminus (24Zinn Justin S. Roumestand C. Drevet P. Ménez A. Toma F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6884-6891Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) even when the toxin is bound to the receptor (22Boulain J.-C. Ménez A. Couderc J. Faure G.

Science. 1982; 217: 732-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, although the convex face of the toxin is not fully accessible to streptavidin in the biotinyltoxin-receptor complex, the N-terminal area is instead freely accessible to macromolecules such as streptavidin or antibodies. These observations agree with the models depicting the three-dimensional structure of long neurotoxins bound almost perpendicularly to the receptor surface (2Harel M. Kasher R. Nicolas A. Guss J.M.

Thus, the flexibility of the tip of the second loop of α-bungarotoxin was demonstrated by NMR spectroscopy and is mostly related to the fifth-disulfide loop of the toxin, which was shown to move as an independent unit upon binding to a receptor peptide (3Moise L.

However, short curarimimetic toxins do not possess this extra disulfide loop. Even if no structure of a complex with a short toxin has ever been published, it has been shown that fasciculin, another short three-finger toxin, interacts with its receptor, acetylcholinesterase, almost as a key in a lock (28Bourne Y.

Therefore, it may not be unreasonable to assume that short-chain curarimimetic toxins interact with muscular-type nicotinic receptors in a “ lock-and-key” manner and do not change their overall structure upon binding.

We have investigated the effect of sulfhydryl labeling on the parasite enzyme, with a view toward developing selective covalent inhibitors by targeting the interface cysteine residue. Differential labeling of the cysteine residues by iodoacetic acid and iodoacetamide has been followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and positions of the labels determined by analysis of tryptic fragments.

Carboxyl methylation of Cys-13 results in formation of monomeric species detectable by gel filtration.

These approaches have led to targeting the enzymes present typically in the pathogen only (7Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) or selectively targeting the pathogen enzyme, if the homologous form exists in the host (8Verlinde C.L.M.J. Merritt E.A.

Two distinct approaches to inactivate target enzymes may be considered. First, the design of inhibitors that compete for the active site, and second, the design of molecules that target subunit interfaces in multimeric proteins and interfere with protein assembly. In the case of many key enzymes the high degree of conservation of the active site in both host and parasite enzymes renders selective targeting difficult. Interfaces may show greater structural variations permitting a distinction between the host and the pathogen enzymes. Two distinct strategies usually considered for disrupting intersubunit contacts in proteins are: (i) the design of synthetic peptides and peptidomimetics of interface segments, which may interfere with the subunit association (9Babe L.M.

In this regard, glycolytic enzymes are attractive targets, primarily because of their central role in energy production in the parasites (15Garza-Ramos G. Perez-Montfort R.

Triose-phosphate isomerase (TIM)1 is an important glycolytic enzyme that catalyzes the interconversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (19Knowles J.R.

From the available knowledge of the structure of TIMs it is seen that the enzyme is a homodimeric protein, except in Thermotoga maritima andPyrococcus woesei, where it is found to be tetrameric (21Maes D. Zeelen J.P. Thanki N. Beaucamp N. Alvarez M. Thi M.H. Backmann J. Martial J.A. Wyns L. Jaenicke R. Wierenga R.K. Proteins. 1999; 37: 441-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,22Walden H.

Each monomer exhibits a pseudo-8-fold symmetry with a central core made up of eight β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices, which are linked together by loops (23Hol W.G.J.

Indian Academy of Sciences, Bangalore, India1991: 215-244Google Scholar). The enzyme has been found to be fully active only as a dimer, but there is no evidence for cooperativity (24Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1973; 135: 165-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant of the dimeric trypanosomal TIM has been reported as 10−11m−1 (25Schliebs W. Thanki N. Jaenicke R. Wierenga R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9655-9662Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These studies reveal that the dimer is quite stable and is the active form of the protein. In fact, there are several reports that suggest that mutations at the subunit interface of the protein destabilize the dimer (26Borchert T.V. Zeelen J.P. Schliebs W. Callens M. Minke W. Jaenicke R.

This knowledge has led to a renewed interest in this enzyme because it could serve as a drug target in many parasitic protozoans.

Recent studies on trypanosomal and leishmanial TIMs reveal that derivatization of an interface cysteine residue using sulfhydryl reagents such as methyl methanethiosulfonate and 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) induces progressive structural alterations and abolition of the catalytic activity (12Gomez-Puyou A.

Although these studies have revealed quite clearly that the interface cysteine residue is critical for the enzymatic activity, a clear correlation of the rates of cysteine labeling with enzyme inactivation and structural perturbation is not available. The interfacing of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) with protein chemistry allows convenient monitoring of the rates of covalent chemical modification. We have earlier described the structural characteristics of P. falciparum TIM (PfTIM) which also contains an interface cysteine residue, Cys-13 (29Gokhale R.S. Ray S.S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Gopal B. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Balaram H. Murthy M.R.N. Balaram P.

Structure. 1997; 5: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, PfTIM has three more cysteine residues at positions 126, 196, and 217 (Fig. 1). In this report we probe the differential reactivity of these four cysteine residues with sulfhydryl-modifying reagents iodoacetic acid (IAA) and iodoacetamide (IAM) using ESI-MS. We demonstrate that labeling of the interface cysteine residue Cys-13 results in weakening of the intersubunit interactions, leading to dimer dissociation with concomitant loss of enzymatic activity. To examine the effect of introducing a negative charge at the interface, as is the case in carboxyl methylated Cys-13, we have examined the stability and activity of a site-directed mutant, C13D. The PfTIM gene was cloned and expressed inEscherichia coli as described before by Ranie et al. (40Ranie J. Kumar V.P. Balaram H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). IAA, IAM, 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), α-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase, NADH, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Sigma and used without further purification. The substrate glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate was obtained as a diethylacetal monobarium salt and processed to its active form according to manufacturer's instructions. The concentration of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate extracted was estimated using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Absorbance spectra were recorded on a double beam spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV210A) using 1-cm path length quartz cuvettes. Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were procured from Amersham Biosciences. Taq DNA polymerase was from Bangalore Genei Private Ltd., Bangalore, India. Conditions recommended by the manufacturer were used for all molecular biology reagents. The E. coli strain AA200 was a gift from Dr. Barbara Bachmann of the E. coli Genetic Stock Centre, New Haven, CT. A plasmid, pTIMC1, carrying wild type PfTIM in the E. coli expression vector pTRC99A (40Ranie J. Kumar V.P. Balaram H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 61: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), was used for the construction of the mutant, C13D. The mutation was introduced by PCR, and the oligonucleotides used were C13D (5′-CCACATGGCTAGAAAATATTTTGTCGCAGCAAACTGGAAA GA AATGGAACT-3′, highlighted letters indicate site of mutation) and TIM8 (5′-ACGGATCCTTACATAGCACTTTTTATTATATC-3′). PCR was carried out, for 30 cycles, in a 50-μl solution containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.01% gelatin, 2.5 mm dNTPs, 400 nmoligonucleotide primers, 5 ng of template, and 2 units ofTaq DNA polymerase with denaturation at 93 °C for 15 s, annealing at 55 °C for 15 s, and extension at 73 °C for 30 s. The amplified product (700 bp) was purified on agarose gel, digested with restriction enzymes NcoI and BamHI, and again purified using Geneclean II (BIO 101, Inc., Vista, CA). This DNA fragment was ligated withNcoI/BamHI-restricted plasmid pTRC99A using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was used to transform the E. coli strain AA200 (garB10, fhuA22,ompF627, fadL701, relA1,pit-10, spoT1, tpi-1,phoM510, merB1). Colonies obtained were screened for the presence of the insert (750 bp). One of the positive clones, pTIMC13D1, was sequenced using an automated DNA sequencing system and confirmed to contain the mutation. PTIMC13D/AA200 induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was analyzed on SDS-PAGE and found to overexpress a protein of the expected size (28 kDa). On analysis of PfTIM C13D by mass spectrometry, a mass of 27,815 Da was obtained. This confirmed the presence of only the required mutation (Cys-13 → Asp) in the mutant C13D. The cysteine residues were labeled by incubating 1 mg of protein with 9.3 mg of the sulfhydryl reagent IAA or IAM in 600 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.7, buffer for varying periods. Excess label was removed from the reaction mixture by chromatography on a Sephadex G-10 gel filtration column before mass spectral and biochemical studies. Kinetic measurements were carried out according to the method of Plaut and Knowles (41Plaut B. Knowles J.R. Biochem. J. 1972; 129: 311-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) on a Shimadzu UV210A double beam spectrophotometer at room temperature. The cuvette contained 100 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.6, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm NADH, 20 μg/ml α-glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase, and 1 mmglyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The enzyme concentration was kept as 0.5 nm for the wild type enzyme and 1 μm for the C13D mutant. Enzyme activity was determined by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. All LC-ESI-MS spectra were recorded on a Hewlett-Packard (model HP-1100) electrospray mass spectrometer coupled to an online 1100 series HPLC. A linear gradient of increasing percentage of acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. A Zorbax SB-phenyl (4.6 mm × 25 cm) reverse phase column was used to separate the tryptic peptides. ESI was carried out using a capillary with an inner diameter of 0.1 mm. The tip was held at 5,000 V in a positive ion detection mode. Nebulization was assisted by N2 gas (99.8%) at a flow rate of 10 liters/min. The spray chamber was held at 300 °C. The ion optics zone was optimized for maximal ion transmission. The best signal was obtained when a declustering potential (fragmentor voltage) of 200 V was set for detection. Data were acquired across a mass range of 125–3,000m/z using a conventional quadrupole with a cycle time of 3 s. The spectrometer was tuned using five calibration standards provided by the manufacturer. Data processing was done using the deconvolution module of the Chemstation software to detect multiple charge states and obtain derived masses of the protein fragments. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded on a Hitachi 650–60 spectrofluorometer. The protein samples were excited at 280 nm and the emission spectra recorded from 300 to 400 nm. Excitation and emission band passes were kept as 5 nm. Corrections for inner filter effects were made to obtain the final spectra. Far UV-CD measurements were carried out on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Ellipticity changes at 220 nm were monitored to follow the unfolding transition. A path length of 1 mm was used, and the spectra were averaged over four scans at a scan speed of 10 nm/min. Analytical gel filtration profiles for differentially labeled cysteines were done on a TSK 3000SW gel filtration column fitted to a Hewlett-Packard 1100 series HPLC. The column was calibrated with standard proteins. The protein was eluted at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min with 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl. The crystal structure of PfTIM, determined at 2.2 Å resolution, is a homodimer, with a very high structural similarity to all other known TIM structures (36Velanker S.S. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Suma S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R.N. Structure. 1997; 5: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The interface is tightly packed and upon dimerization, 1,654 Å2 of the total surface area per monomer is buried at the interface (36Velanker S.S. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Suma S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R.N. Structure. 1997; 5: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Each of the subunits contains four cysteine residues (Fig. 1). Among them, Cys-13 is of special interest because it is absent in human TIM (see comparison of sequences in Fig. 1). Cys-13 is present on loop 1 at the interface and lies very close to the active site residues, Lys-12, His-95, and Glu-165. The thiol side chain points toward the interface loop region of the other subunit (Asn-71 to Ser-79) (the residue numbering used here follows the PfTIM sequence as reported earlier (36Velanker S.S. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Suma S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R.N. Structure. 1997; 5: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar)). Indeed, Cys-13 has been used to engineer a pair of symmetric intersubunit disulfides in the mutant Y74C (30Gopal B. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Balaram H. Murthy M.R.N. Balaram P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 478-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The other three cysteine residues are at positions 126, 196, and 217. Cys-126 is located on β-strand 4, whereas Cys-196 and Cys-217 are found on helix 6 and helix 7, respectively, of the α8/β8TIM barrel (36Velanker S.S. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Suma S. Balaram H. Balaram P. Murthy M.R.N. Structure. 1997; 5: 751-761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Among the four cysteines it is observed that Cys-126 is conserved in all known TIMs and is completely buried.

Open table in a new tab The rates of labeling of cysteine residues were monitored using ESI-MS. Fig. 2 shows the electrospray mass spectra of PfTIM taken at different time points after initiating labeling with IAA. Carboxyl methylation leads to a mass increase of 58 Da/modified residue. It is clearly seen that at the end of 4 h, a heterogeneous population of species bearing one, two, three, and four labels is detected. Fig. 3 shows the time course of labeling of cysteine residues in PfTIM using IAA and IAM. To determine the sites of labeling, ESI-MS of peptide fragments generated by trypsin digestion of the unlabeled and differentially labeled protein were compared. Fig. 4shows a mass detected, reverse phase HPLC profile (total ion chromatogram) of a tryptic digest generated from the wild type enzyme. The peaks corresponding to the peptide fragments bearing the four cysteines are marked. Mass spectra corresponding to representative peaks are shown, and a comparison is made of the spectra obtained after IAA labeling. These studies establish that the rate of cysteine labeling is in the order Cys-196 > Cys-13 ≫ Cys-217/Cys-126. Inspection of the crystal structure confirms that Cys-126 and Cys-217 are almost completely inaccessible to the label in the native conformation. Cys-196 is the most exposed among all cysteine residues present and hence is the most reactive sulfhydryl (Table I). Interestingly, Cys-13, which has only limited accessibility in the native dimeric structure, undergoes fairly rapid modification with both IAA and IAM. During the course of our studies we observed that IAM labeling gradually results in the formation of insoluble protein aggregates, whereas labeling with IAA yielded a soluble protein even after extensive modification. Indeed, rapid labeling of the interface cysteine has also been observed in earlier studies carried out with trypanosomal and leishmanial TIMs (36Velanker S.S. Ray S.S. Gokhale R.S. Suma S. Balaram H.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 933-937Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). This enhanced reactivity may be attributed to cysteine pKa values, local dynamics at the interface formed by irregular loop structures of the two monomers (loop 3), and occupancy of the catalytic site as suggested by Reyes-Vivas et al.

In the case of the latter, there is a very rapid fall in the enzymatic activity accompanied by precipitation of the protein. The loss of activity is more gradual in the case of IAA, notably about 30% of the activity is retained even after about 5–6 h of labeling. Because the labeling reagent was in excess, pseudo first-order kinetics was used to calculate the rate constant for the process leading to loss of enzymatic activity. From the slope of the semilog plot (Fig. 5), the rate constants for IAA and IAM were 0.0039 and 0.0256 min−1, respectively. Fig.6 shows the electrospray mass spectra of PfTIM labeled with IAM after 10 min. A singly labeled species (27,888 Da), corresponding to the addition of one carboxamidomethyl group (ΔM 57 Da) is predominantly observed. A very small amount (approximately 10%) of a doubly labeled species (27,945 Da) is also detected. LC-MS of a tryptic digest at this stage revealed major peptide fragments with the following masses: 8,180, 15,181, and a minor population of 15,238 Da. The species at 8,180 Da corresponds to the fragment Thr-174 to Met-247 (8,123 Da), with the addition of the carboxamidomethyl group. Further tryptic digestion yielded smaller fragments at 710 and 3,386 Da. The former corresponds to the peptide Asp-194 to Lys-199, with an addition of a carboxamidomethyl group, whereas the latter corresponds to Ile-206 to Lys-237 without modification. This suggests that labeling has occurred almost exclusively at Cys-196. The other fragment at 15,181 Da corresponds to the sequence Ala-1 to Arg-133 without modification. This fragment contains both Cys-13 and Cys-126, confirming the absence of modification at these residues. The small population of the 15,238-Da fragment corresponds to the addition of a single carboxamidomethyl group to 15,181 Da (Ala-1 to Arg-133). The smaller peptides obtained from this fragment by further digestion revealed that Cys-13 was labeled, whereas Cys-126 remained unreactive. Therefore from the analysis of the tryptic fragments we infer that the major species is almost exclusively labeled at Cys-196, a conclusion that is supported by the fact that Cys-196 is a surface sulfhydryl, remote from the active site. At this state of labeling the loss of enzyme activity was only 10–12% (Fig. 5). Therefore we conclude that labeling of Cys-196 results in practically no modification of enzymatic activity. On the other hand, Cys-13 is proximate to the active site residue, Lys-12, and is also involved in critical interfa"

We have found thatCdc6 expression is down-regulated in prostate cancer as detected by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR of prostate cell lines and laser-captured microdissected prostate tissues. This result was substantiated by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded tissue sections and immunoblot analysis of benign (BPH-1) and adenocarcinomatous prostatic cells. Furthermore, a 100-fold reduction in the transcription efficiency of the Cdc6promoter-luciferase construct was noted in the metastatic PC3 cells compared with that in BPH-1 cells. Concentration of the E2F and Oct1 transcription factors that have putative binding sites in theCdc6 promoter was substantially low in PC3 cells compared with BPH cells. Mutagenesis of the two E2F binding sites on theCdc6 promoter resulted in increased promoter activity in PC3 cells owing to elimination of the negative regulation by pRb·E2F complex but not to the level of that obtained in BPH cells. We conclude that an altered interaction of transcription factors may be responsible for the down-regulation of Cdc6transcription in PC3 cells. Our study suggests a potential use of the lack of CDC6 expression as an index of prostate cancer development.

Murray T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1999; 49: 8-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (3131) Google Scholar). Along with the classic methods of diagnosing and prognosticating prostate cancer, utilizing stage, grade, and serum prostate-specific antigen level, molecular markers of aggressive disease are currently being evaluated as adjuncts to improve identification of tumors associated with a poor outcome. Because abnormal regulation of the cell cycle is one of the major causes of tumorigenesis in recent years, major advances have been made to understand the molecular mechanisms of aberrant cell cycle control leading to the development and progression of tumors. Studies on the aberrant expression of cell cycle regulatory genes in prostate carcinoma have identified a cdk1 inhibitor p27 kip1 (2Cheville J.C. Llyod R.V. Sebo T.J. Cheng L. Erickson L. Bostwick D.G. Lohse C.M. Wollan P. Mod. Pathol. 1998; 11: 324-328PubMed Google Scholar) and p53 (3Bauer J.J. Sesterhenn I.A. Mostofi P.K. McLeod D.G. Srivastava S. Moul J.W. J.

Urol. 1997; 158: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), have also been found to be helpful in identifying patients with aggressive prostate cancer. One of the major underlying mechanisms of aberrant cell cycle progression is uncontrolled DNA replication irrespective of cellular signals as a result of G1/S checkpoint failure. DNA replication is a highly ordered event controlled by sequential binding to and release of a number of replication proteins from the DNA sequence close to the origin of DNA replication. This also restricts firing of the replication origin to once per cell cycle. The regulation of initiation of DNA replication has been studied extensively inSaccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas understanding of this regulation in the mammalian system has just begun. However, identification of human homologs of yeast replication proteins, such as origin recognition complex (7Gavin K.A. Hidaka M. Stillman B.

Studies on DNA replication in S. cerevisiae and Xenopus laevishave established a critical role of CDC6 in the initiation of replication (14Dutta A. Bell S.P. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 721-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). In late mitosis, when mitotic cyclin (cyclin B) and cdk are inactive, CDC6 helps to establish the prereplicative complex (Pre-RC) on the chromatin-bound origin recognition complex, a six-subunit initiator protein (17Bell S.P. Stillman B. Nature. 1992; 357: 128-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar), by recruiting MCM proteins and other factors (18Donovan S. Harwood J.L. Drury S. Diffley J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In middle to late G1 and at the G1/S transition, S-phase cyclins (cyclin E and cyclin A) and cdk2 are expressed (21Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T.

Science. 1992; 257: 1958-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar) and initiate DNA replication by phosphorylating CDC6, which causes it to dissociate from Pre-RC (23Peterson B.O. Lukas J. Sorensen C.S. Bartek J. Helin K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 396-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Release of CDC6 from chromatin and its translocation to the cytoplasm triggers initiation of DNA replication (24Herbig U. Griffith J.W. Fanning E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4117-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Another role of CDC6 inS. cerevisiae is to function as an inhibitor of the G2/M phase until the S phase is complete (25Bueno A. Russell P. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2167-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). This defines CDC6 as a unique and critical protein with a dual role in regulating both G1/S and G2/S checkpoints. The regulation of CDC6 expression throughout the cell cycle in mammalian cells, however, is quite different than that observed in proliferating yeast. In yeast, most of the phosphorylated CDC6 at the G1/S boundary is degraded by ubiquitination, whereas in mammalian cells, a fraction of phosphorylated CDC6 remains bound to chromatin throughout the cell cycle and prevents reloading of MCM protein until the end of mitosis when degradation of mitotic cyclin occurs (26Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). Maintenance of a cytoplasmic pool of hypophosphorylated CDC6 has been proposed in a model for CDC6 regulation in mammalian cells (26Mendez J. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8602-8612Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar), although its role in the reassembly of Pre-RC in the next round of DNA replication or in delaying the M phase is elusive. Being a key regulator of DNA replication and the G2/M checkpoint, CDC6 expression needs to be tightly regulated for normal cell cycle progression. Several lines of evidence indicate that a gain in expression of CDC6 leads to increased DNA synthesis (27Liang C. Stillman B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3375-3386Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 28Stoeber K. Mills A.D. Kubota Y. Krude T. Romanowski P. Marheineke K. Laskey R.A. Williams G.H.

Cell. 1993; 74: 371-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), leading to the designation of CDC6 as a proliferation marker. On the other hand, loss of expression of CDC6 has been shown to cause chromosomal loss and a lack of G2/M checkpoint control resulting in abnormal daughter cells (11Williams R.S. Shohet R.V. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Bruschi C.V. McMillan J.N. Coglievina M. Esposito M.S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although an important component of the cell cycle regulatory mechanism, potential involvement of CDC6 in carcinogenesis has been investigated only recently. Recent reports on the overexpression of CDC6 and MCM proteins in low grade and high grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia of cervix and brain tumors suggested their possible use as proliferation markers for detecting abnormal precursor malignant cells in cervical smears and tumors in brain tissues (32Williams G.H. Romanowski P. Morris L. Madine M. Mills A.D. Stoeber K. Marr J. Laskey R.A. Coleman N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14932-14937Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 33Ohta S. Koide M. Tokuyama T. Yokota N. Nishizawa S. Namba H. Oncol. Rep. 2001; 8: 1063-1066PubMed Google Scholar). These reports suggest a possible role for CDC6 in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Using differential display of mRNA and cDNA microarrays, we have identified altered expression of CDC6 in prostate cancer cell lines. Here we report loss of CDC6 transcription as an event toward acquiring a cancerous phenotype of prostatic epithelium as observed by immunohistochemistry of tissue sections and semiquantitative RT-PCR of laser-captured microdissected prostate tissues. We have used a cell line developed from benign prostate hyperplasia and a prostate adenocarcinoma cell line to elucidate the mechanism of down-regulation of CDC6 expression in a prostate cancer cell line. We provide evidence that the loss of Cdc6 transcription is due to sub-optimal transcription not mutation at the promoter sequence. Three commercially available cell lines, LNCaP, DU145, and PC3 (ATCC) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (LNCaP and DU145) and in Ham's F-12 (PC3) with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. A benign prostatic hyperplasia cell line, BPH-1 (a gift from P. Narayan, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) (34Hayward S.W. Dahiya R. Cunha G.R. Bartek J. Deshpande N. Narayan P. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. 1995; 31A: 14-24Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. A metastatic cell line, MDAPCa2a (M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) (35Navone N.M. Olive M. Ozen M. Davis R. Troncoso P., Tu, S. Johnston D. Pollack A. Pathak S. vonEschenbach A.C.

Jamesville, MD) medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum and gentamicin. BRFF medium contains cholera toxin, insulin, epidermal growth factor, and hydrocortisone. Total RNA was extracted from cell lines using an RNA extraction kit (RNAgents, Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Genomic DNA from BPH-1 and PC3 cells was extracted using a genomic DNA isolation kit (Puregene DNA Isolation kit, Gentra Systems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Approximately 400–5000 cells were captured from prostate cancer or histologically normal prostatic epithelium using a Pix cell II laser capture microdissection system (Arcturus Engineering, Mountainview, CA). Frozen sections of prostate tissue from radical prostetectomy were used for microdissection of normal and cancerous areas on the basis of histologic features of normal or carcinomatous epithelia following staining with hematoxylin and eosin stain. Cells were microdissected rapidly from each frozen section in an RNase-free environment to avoid RNA degradation Twenty micrograms of total RNA from BPH-1, LNCaP, and PC3 cell lines was used for Northern blot using a standard procedure. A 1.6-kb clone of humanCdc6 cDNA was used as the probe for hybridization. For semiquantitative RT-PCR, BPH-1, DU145, and MDAPCa2a cells and laser capture microdissected tissue samples obtained from radical prostetectomies were used. Total RNA was extracted using Stat 60 (Tel-Test Inc.) and used for RT reaction using oligo(dT) primer and 18 S RNA primer pairs and their competimers (Quantum RNA, Ambion) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The 18 S primers were used to yield a 489-bp fragment of 18 S rRNA as an internal control, and total RNA from BPH cells was used as the positive control. A Cdc6 gene-specific forward (5′-CTGGAGTTTGCTGCTGCCGCT-3′) and reverse (5′-GAGCACCAGAAAGGTAAAGGC-3′) primer pair was used to yield an 811-bp fragment. Amplified fragments were visualized by Southern blot using Cdc6 and 18 S cDNAs as probes. Positive signals were quantified in a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences) and normalized with the relative values of 18 S RNA signal. For Cdc6 promoter-luciferase constructs, theCdc6 promoter region spanning positions −1436 to +218 was amplified by genomic PCR using genomic DNA from BPH-1 cells as the template, Taq-Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) (19:1 mixture), and primers (F5′-GCAGCCCATTCTCTTCACTTTTCG-3′ and R5′-GCTCTTTTCCCTTCACTTCACCTC-3′). The amplified product was cloned into pGL3 basic firefly luciferase vector (Promega) between SstI and HindIII sites and designated as construct C. Two other deletion constructs, construct B and construct A, containing the promoter fragments ranging from −794 to +218 and −391 to +218, respectively, were made. Fidelity of the amplified Ccd6promoter sequence was confirmed by dideoxy chain termination sequencing using an ABI 310 sequence analyzer (PE Biosystems), and putative transcription factor binding sites were identified using an online program (www.bioinformatik.de). Four more constructs designated as D (NFκB), E (C/EBP), F (NF1), and G (Oct1) were made by PCR amplification to map the region between −1436 and −794 bases according to the putative transcription factor binding sites. A set of forward primers containing SstI restriction site (NFκB, 5′-GAGCTCTAAAAACTCAGC-3′; C/EBP, 5′-GAGCTCGCGCTAATTTATATTTTTCAT-3′; NF1, 5′-GAGCTCGGTGATGTAGGTAAAATAC-3′; and Oct1, 5′-GAGCTCCCTCATTTGTAAAGTGAAATAACA-3′) and a common reverse primer containing a HindII restriction site (5′-AACAGTACCGGAATGCCAAG-3′) were used for directional cloning. The construct C was used as the template. A PCR-based mutagenesis method described in the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used to substitute nucleotides in two E2F binding sites at positions −43 to −36 and −8 to −1 from the transcription start site. The E2F binding motif TTTGGCGG in both locations was converted to TTTGAAGG in construct C and used for transfection. Both BPH and PC3 cells were grown to 80% confluency and used for transient transfection with the pGL3 constructs and pRL-TK (Promega) as an internal control vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's specification. Transfected cells were maintained in the culture media and harvested between 48 and 72 h, and luciferase expression was monitored using a Dual Luciferase assay kit (Promega) according the supplier's protocol. Relative luminescence from the expressed luciferase was normalized with the expression ofRenilla luciferase. Transfection efficiencies were calculated as the relative luminescence unit (RLU) ratio of pGL3 constructs over that of pGL3 basic vector. BPH-1 and PC3 cells were grown to 80% confluency and harvested using freeze-thaw cycle in a lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 120 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, and 2 ml/ml of the protease inhibitor mixture Set III (Calbiochem)). Crude cell lysates were centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. For cytoplasmic and nuclear extract, 100 μl of packed cell volume of each cell and nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents (NE-PER, Pierce) were used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cytoplasmic fractions in the supernatant were collected and stored at −80 °C until use. Nuclear pellets were collected and lysed by vortexing in a lysis buffer NER (Pierce), and soluble proteins were separated in the supernatant by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were stored at −80 °C until use for Western blot analysis. Total cell extracts from asynchronous cultures of BPH-1 and PC3 were used for immunoblot analysis using a standard procedure. 50 μg of total protein and antibodies against CDC6 (a gift from Dr. Anindya Dutta, Harvard Medical School and Oncogene Research Products, La Jolla, CA), E2F1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), NF1, NFκB, C/EBP alpha, and Oct1 (Geneka Biotechnology Inc., Montreal, Quebec, Canada) were used to monitor expression of specific proteins. A chemiluminescence detection kit (Pierce) was used to detect positive signals recognized by specific antibodies using either a goat anti-mouse or a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. For immunohistochemistry, paraffin-embedded tissue sections of normal and malignant prostate were subjected to a pepsin-based antigen retrieval protocol (BioGenex, San Ramon, CA) followed by incubation with anti-CDC6 antibody. A biotinylated multilink goat anti-immunoglobulin for mouse, rabbit, guinea pig, and rat was used as the secondary antibody. Positive signals were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromagen (BioGenex Multi-Link kit). Univariate receiver operating characteristic analyses were carried out for the log 10 value forCdc6 expression in uninvolved and adenocarcinoma tissue samples to examine their utility for predicting an uninvolved (yes/no) outcome. The sensitivity and specificity trade-offs were summarized using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, denoted AUC, and calculated via a logistic regression model (36Pepe M.S. Biometrika. 1997; 84: 595-608Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). An AUC value of 1.0 corresponds to an excellent predictive model, whereas an AUC value of 0.5 corresponds to a poor predictive model. In our effort to identify differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer using differential display RT-PCR and cDNA microarray technology, we identified Cdc6 as one of the candidate genes that are down-regulated in prostate cancer. A gradual loss of the steady-state Cdc6 mRNA concentration was detected by differential display RT-PCR in LNCaP and PC3 cells when compared with that in BPH-1 cells. This result was further confirmed by RNA blot analysis (Fig. 1 A). In addition, a reduced concentration of Cdc6 transcript (ratio of expression: 31.2) in a metastatic prostate cancer cell line, MDAPCa2a, compared with a normal prostate cell line, PrEC, has been detected by hybridization to a cDNA microarray of 18,376 nonredundant clones (data not shown). Down-regulation ofCdc6 was also evident from semiquantitative RT-PCR followed by densitometric analysis of Cdc6 mRNA present in DU145 and MDAPCa2a cells (Fig. 1, B and C). The data showed a significant loss of the Cdc6 steady-state transcript level in MDAPCa2a cells but a moderate reduction of the same in DU145 cells. Western blot analysis of CDC6 using an anti-CDC6 antibody further confirmed the loss of CDC6 expression in the metastatic PC3 cells compared with the benign BPH-1 (Fig.1 D). The upper band in the BPH-1 whole cell extract lane (Fig. 1 D) is probably the phosphorylated form of CDC6, because human CDC6 does not become degraded upon inactivation by phosphorylation as observed in S. cerevisiae. Analysis of the distribution of CDC6 in subcellular fractions showed an accumulation of CDC6 in the nuclear fraction of BPH-1 cells as expected and a substantial reduction of CDC6 in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of PC3 cells (Fig. 1 E). To validate the expression profile ofCdc6 in human prostatic adenocarcinoma, we have monitoredCdc6 mRNA concentration by semiquantitative RT-PCR in histologically normal prostatic epithelium and prostatic adenocarcinoma. To ensure homogeneous cell populations, laser-captured microdissected areas of histologically normal and carcinomatous tissues were used. Amplification of Cdc6 cDNA was normalized by co-amplified 18 S ribosomal mRNA. 18 S competimers were used along with the specific 18 S primers to maintain a comparable amplification intensity of the highly abundant 18 S rRNA compared with a very low copy number of the input RNA. Southern blot analysis followed by densitometric analysis of the amplified products showed a consistently reduced expression of Cdc6 mRNA in adenocarcinoma tissues compared with that in matched normal prostatic epithelium in six out of eight sample pairs tested (Fig.2, A and B). Similar final digits among the sample numbers designate matched samples. In samples N4 and T4 and in P10 (prostate intraepithelial neoplasia) and T10, Cdc6 mRNA concentrations were below the detection limit, whereas Cdc6 mRNA concentration was higher in adenocarcinoma T5 than in the matched normal epithelium N5. In adenocarcinoma samples without matching normal epithelium, T9, T11, and T12, Cdc6 mRNA concentrations were lower than that in four out of seven normal epithelial samples (N3, N6, N7, and N8). Histologically normal prostate epithelium and adenocarcinomas were obtained from radical prostetectomy specimens from patients with prostate cancer. The mean patient age at the time of surgery was 63.3 ± 4.3 ranging between 55 and 71 years. The Gleason scores of the adenocarcinoma ranged from 6 to 9 at the following frequencies: A Gleason score of 6 equals four tumors, a Gleason score of 7 equals six tumors, and a Gleason score of 9 equals one tumor. The cases were divided into two groups: 1) cases with organ-confined disease and no invasion into seminal vesicle or bladder and 2) cases with extension of tumors to the seminal vesicle or bladder. Group 1 tumors all had a Gleason score of 6 (two) whereas group 2 tumors had a Gleason score of 7 or higher (six) and 6 (one). Analysis showed that group 2 tumors are associated with a significant loss of Cdc6 transcripts, ranging from 86 to 99% of that of the normal epithelium, whereas group 1 tumors exhibit a moderate loss of transcripts ranging from 28 to 50% of that measured in matched histologically normal tissues (Table I). Carcinomas without matching normal epithelium showed 79–99% reduction in the transcript concentration compared with the average concentration of all uninvolved tissues.Table ICorrelation of Gleason scores with expression of Cdc6 transcriptsCasesGleason scoreExpression of uninvolvedMatched tumorsIsolated tumors %Group 16 (2) 51–72Group 27–9 (6), 6 (1) 0.13–140.15–21 Open table in a new tab The univariate analysis of Cdc6 expression showed an odds ratio of 3.1 and an AUC value of 0.800 (Table I). The higher the AUC, the better the predictor; therefore, in the univariate case, Cdc6 is a better predictor because the AUC is closer to 1.0. The interpretation of the odds ratio is that for every 10-fold increase in expression, the odds of being an uninvolved case relative to not being uninvolved increases by the amount given above, e.g. for every 10-fold increase in Cdc6, the odds of being uninvolved as compared with uninvolved increased 3.1 to 1. To correlate CDC6 expression with the histologic features of normal prostatic epithelium and prostatic adenocarcinoma, CDC6 proteins were detected in prostate tissue samples by immunostaining using an anti-CDC6 antibody (Fig.3). Tissue sections containing histologically normal epithelium, adenocarcinoma, and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) were chosen for comparative analysis. Areas with positive signals were compared with the H&E-stained, parallel sections for accurate identification of normal and carcinomatous areas. As shown in Fig, 3, normal epithelium showed a positive homogeneous staining for CDC6, with granular cytoplasmic and nuclear staining observed in the prostatic luminal cells (Fig. 3,A and B). PIN also showed distinct staining similar to that observed in the histologically normal glands (Fig. 3,C and D). In carcinoma, a significant reduction in overall staining for CDC6, representing loss of expression can be seen (Fig. 3, E and F). A similar expression pattern of CDC6 was observed in histologic sections from eight different prostate tissues. This observation is also in agreement with our semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showing the reducedCdc6 transcripts in prostate adenocarcinoma. To understand the regulation of CDC6 expression in PC3 cells, we conducted a luciferase gene assay using a 1.654-kb fragment of Cdc6 promoter. Sequence analysis of Cdc6promoters amplified from PC3 and BPH-1 or from a normal prostate cancer cell line (PrEC, Clonetics) did not show any mutations (data not shown). Computer analysis of the promoter sequence revealed a variety of putative transcription factor binding sites, including E2F, Sp1, NF1, NFκβ, Oct1, and C/EBP (Fig.4 A), which may or may not be utilized in a particular cell line. Interestingly, the pGL3-Cdc6 construct C containing the entire 1.654-kb promoter fragment showed a considerable difference in luciferase expression upon transfection of BPH-1 versus PC3 cells (Fig.4 B). Approximately 50- to 100-fold higher transcription efficiency (1040 ± 128 versus 10 ± 6) of construct C was noted in transfected BPH-1 cells compared with that in PC3 cells. The construct B, containing a truncated promoter of the 794-bp fragment, showed an overall decline in the transcription efficiency compared with that obtained by the entire promoter, construct C, as expected. Although construct B was less efficient because of the lack of three C/EBP, two NF1, one NFκB, and one Oct1 binding sites, a 16-fold difference in relative luminescence units (RLU) (373 ± 93 versus 22 ± 16) was detected in BPH-1 cells compared with PC3 cells transfected with the same construct. Construct A, composed of a 391-bp promoter fragment containing three E2F, three Sp1, and one NF1 sites, however, was inefficient in driving the luciferase transcription in either cell line. The RLU for construct A measured in both cell lines was close to the basal RLU of the basic pGL3 without any promoter. Although construct B did not have any putative transcription factor binding sites, the additional 403-bp sequence in construct B was able to stimulate luciferase transcription, suggesting interaction/binding of unknown proteins with this region. The control vector containing an SV40 promoter was equally effective in luciferase transcription in both cell lines. Further mapping of the upstream sequence showed a significant increase in the luciferase expression by the transfected BPH-1 cells following inclusion of the NFκB binding site in construct B (construct D) (Fig. 4 B).

In the Escherichia coli reaction (4Lahue R.S., Au, K.G. Modrich P. Science. 1989; 245: 160-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), MutS homodimers bind to mismatched DNA and MutS plus MutL homodimers form ternary complexes with mismatched DNA. MutS and MutL, plus hydrolyzable ATP, are necessary and sufficient to efficiently activate MutH endonuclease to nick unmethylated DNA strands (corresponding to nascent DNA during replication) at hemimethylated d(GATC) sites and to activate helicase II at the nicks. Subsequent excision of the nicked strand along the shorter path toward the mismatch employs 5′ to 3′ or a 3′ to 5′ exonucleases, depending on the nick-mismatch orientation. The replicative DNA polymerase III holoenzyme fills the excision gap. In the more highly evolved mammalian MMR system, heterodimers of MutS-homolog (MSH) proteins with different but overlapping substrate specificities, MSH2·MSH6 (hMutSα) and MSH2·MSH3 (hMutSβ), recognize mismatches. A MutL-homolog (MLH) heterodimer, MLH1·PMS2, designated MutLα, mediates most error correction, and hydrolyzable ATP is required. Protein-protein interaction and genetic studies have further implicated proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), exonuclease I, replication protein A (single-strand DNA binding protein), replication factor C, and the replicative DNA polymerase δ (1Buermyer A.B. Deschenes S.M. Baker S.M. Liskay R.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1999; 33: 533-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 2Jiricny J. Nystrom-Lahti M. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Eukaryotes lack both MutH and adenine methylation. The sequence of biochemical events by which MMR-specific proteins, in association with auxiliary proteins, recognize a DNA mispair in the context of million-fold excess homoduplex DNA, select the nascent DNA strand, and initiate excision of that strand toward the mispair remains poorly understood despite valuable insights gained from many studies. The nature(s) of the essential role(s) of ATP in these events are in dispute. One approach has been to employ purified proteins and synthetic DNA substrates, in the presence or absence of ATP (or its analogs) and magnesium, to analyze coupling of mismatch recognition to downstream events. MSH proteins bind short linear mismatched DNA, but equilibrium binding is lost in the presence of ATP (5Grilley M. Welsh K.M., Su, S.-S. Modrich P. J. Biol.

However, these proteins remain bound in the presence of ATP when DNA ends are physically blocked, suggesting that ATP binding causes MutS or MSH2·MSH6 proteins to move away from the mismatch along the DNA by unidirectional ATP hydrolysis-dependent translocation (11Allen D.J.

Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In the latter case, subsequent ATP hydrolysis is postulated to reset the system for another cycle of mismatch recognition and correction (13Gradia S. Subramanian D. Wilson T. Acharya S. Makhov A. Griffith J. Fishel R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 255-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Eukaryotic MLH proteins, in the presence of ATP or some non-hydrolyzable analogs, stabilize the respective MSH proteins on linear mismatched DNA with unblocked ends (14Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9837-9841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In some cases, the ternary complexes appear static in the presence of non-hydrolyzable ATP analogs but more dynamic in the presence of ATP, even to the extent of moving off ends of short mismatched DNA (15Blackwell L.J. Wang S. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 33233-33240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Prokaryotic strand-specific initiation has been modeled using hemi-d(GATC)- methylated DNA, purified E. coli MutS, MutL, and MutH proteins, and ATP. Under special conditions, one mismatched DNA molecule can in the presence of MutS and MutL stimulate intrans MutH incision at a hemimethylated d(GATC) site on a separate homoduplex molecule; therefore, some investigators have proposed that MutS·MutL complexes bound at or very near the mismatch locate d(GATC) sites through space, via DNA bending (16Junop M.S. Obmolova G. Rausch K. Hsieh P. Yang W. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 1-12Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). However, this model does not readily account for the strong preference of the post-incision helicase/exonuclease for the shorter (nick-mismatch) arc in circular substrates (17Grilley M. Griffith J. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11830-11837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Fang W.-h. Modrich P. J. Biol.

All three searching models, DNA bending, diffusing clamp, and hydrolysis-driven unidirectional translocation, are considered to apply to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic mismatch correction. Here we have used human nuclear extracts that efficiently and rapidly correct mismatches in exogenous circular DNA with single defined nicks. A recently developed DNA excision gap assay (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was used to kinetically dissect the MMR pathway. Mispair-provoked 3′ to 5′ or 5′ to 3′ excision along the shorter nick-mispair path proves to be initiated at the same rates. We demonstrate a very early ATP binding requirement for efficient initiation of the MMR pathway and an ATP hydrolysis requirement for stable (competitor substrate-resistant) commitment. Inhibition of 3′ to 5′, but not 5′ to 3′, excision by the drug aphidicolin implicates its target DNA polymerases (pol) δ and/or ε in 3′ to 5′ MMR excision. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by MWG Biotech. T4 kinase was purchased from Invitrogen, and [γ-32P]ATP was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. DNA mismatch repair substrates sCPDC(g/t)n and sCPDRev(a/c)n were constructed as described in detail elsewhere (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, we nicked plasmids pUC19CPDC and pUC19CPDRev at their (only) two sites for endonuclease N.BstNBI and purified products with defined gaps into which we ligated 32-mers generating, respectively, G/T and A/C mismatches, then introduced nicks for initiation of MMR excision by cleavage at the single sites recognized by a second sequence-specific nicking enzyme, N.AlwI endonuclease. In substrate sCPDC(g/t)n, the lengths of the shorter 3′ to 5′ and longer 5′ to 3′ paths from the nick in the sense strand (collinear with the bla gene sense strand) to the G/T mispair are, respectively, 155 and 1847 nt. In substrate sCPDRev(a/c)n, the lengths of the shorter 5′ to 3′ and longer 3′ to 5′ paths from the antisense strand nick to the A/C mispair are, respectively, 149 and 1854 nt. Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa cells, and mismatch repair reactions were carried out and analyzed as described elsewhere (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, we assembled on ice 225-μl reaction mixtures (scaled up from the 15-μl mixtures previously described) that contained 1125 fmol of substrate sCPDC(g/t)n or sCPDRev(a/c)n (1500 ng), 1500 μg of nuclear extract, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 110 mm KCl, and 1 mm glutathione. For analysis of complete error correction, mixtures were 100 μm in all four dNTPs. Mixtures were either initially 1.5 mm in ATP and 5 mm in MgCl2, or were made so later, as follows: for ATP-initiated reactions, mixtures lacking ATP were incubated 20 min on ice, then transferred to tubes containing the requisite concentrated ATP at 37 °C; for magnesium-initiated reactions, mixtures lacking Mg2+ were incubated 20 min on ice, then transferred to tubes containing concentrated MgCl2 at 37 °C. After incubation for the desired times, we removed 15-μl aliquots, extracted DNA, and assayed restoration (G/T or A/C to A/T) of the recognition site (ATTAAT) for restriction endonuclease AseI, as described previously (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Gaps produced by mismatch-provoked excision were frozen by omitting exogenous dNTPs from standard MMR incubations. Levels of excision at particular locations at various times were determined as described (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly,32P-labeled oligomer probes complementary to the non-nicked strand, downstream from the nick position along the shorter nick-mispair path (147–178 nucleotides (nt) downstream of the nick for substrate sCPDC(g/t)n and 141–172 nt downstream the nick for substrate sCPDRev(a/c)n) were annealed to DNA extracted at various times. Probe-substrate hybrids were separated from excess probes by gel electrophoresis and analyzed by phosphorimaging (to detect probe amounts in DNA bands) and ethidium bromide staining (to normalize for DNA amounts in the bands). Excision gap (probe binding) signals were expressed relative to final plateau signals. These plateau values, under standard MMR conditions (but without exogenous dNTPs), typically correspond to roughly 40% of input substrate molecules (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In some cases, aphidicolin was included in the reaction mixtures at 90 μm final concentration. In some analyses (such as for estimation of excision rates), the reaction was scaled up 2-fold, and both proximal (32–61 nt downstream of the nick) and distal (147–178 nt downstream from the nick) probes were annealed separately to half of each DNA sample. The competitor substrate sHE/XE(g/t)n, prepared from plasmids pUC19HE and pUC19XE as described (21Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), incorporates a (G/T) mispair at coordinate 145 and a nick in the T-containing (antisense) strand 130 nt away (3′) from the mispair. Thus nick-initiated 3′ to 5′ excision and resynthesis creates a G/C base pair, so there is no diagnostic AseI recognition sequence at the site of the former mismatch, unlike corrected sCPDC(g/t)n and sCPDRev(a/c)n substrates; the pre-existing vector backbone AseI site remains present, as in sCPDC(g/t)n and sCPDRev(a/c)n. To assay competitor-resistant MMR complexes stably committed to error correction, we added 2.5 μg of sHE/XE(g/t)n competitor DNA (25-fold excess) at various times, then continued the incubation and measured the final yield of corrected products byAseI endonuclease treatment and gel electrophoresis, as described under “Mismatch Repair Reactions in HeLa Cell Nuclear Extracts,” with the following modifications. The gel portion containing the intense upper band, corresponding to unrepaired substrate plus excess competitor DNA, was documented at short film exposure times and removed. The lower bands, corresponding to corrected products (cut twice byAseI endonuclease) were documented at longer film exposure times, and their intensities were normalized for loading and recovery variations using the respective upper band intensities. The respective normalized product intensities were expressed relative to that for a control reaction in which competitor DNA was added at the end of incubation. Effects of competitor DNA on 3′ to 5′ excision of substrate sCPDC(g/t)n in the presence of aphidicolin were measured as described under “Analysis of MMR Excision,” taking advantage of the fact that the distal probe cannot bind to either strand of competitor DNA. We previously analyzed MMR excision by omitting exogenous dNTPs from standard reactions to freeze excision intermediates and annealing specific oligomer probes to different positions in gapped intermediates derived from nicked circular DNA substrates (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This assay revealed high specificity for mismatched versus homoduplex DNA substrates, for excision of the nicked strand versus the continuous strand and for shorter versus longer nick-mispair paths, whether they were 5′ to 3′ or 3′ to 5′. Gapped structures could be quantitatively converted to corrected products using DNA polymerase and dNTPs, i.e. they were genuine MMR intermediates. Background excision signals at positions distant from the nick-mispair region were very low. Here, to identify early ATP-dependent step(s) in MMR in human nuclear extracts, we used substrate sCPDC(g/t)n, in which the pre-existing nick is 155 nt 3′ to a G/T mismatch, and initiated either error correction (restoration of a site for AseI endonuclease in complete reaction mixtures) or 3′ to 5′ excision (in the absence of dNTPs) in two different ways: all components, except Mg2+ or ATP, were assembled and incubated on ice for 20 min, then Mg2+ or ATP was added concomitantly with shifting to 37 °C. Excised intermediates, measured using a radiolabeled 32-nt probe complementary to the T strand in the vicinity of the mismatch, generally preceded corrected products (by roughly 50–60 s at one-half completion), but both reached plateaus corresponding to about 40% of input substrates (Fig. 1). ATP-initiated reactions (Fig. 1, squares) generally lagged behind Mg2+-initiated reactions (circles) suggesting that ATP, but not ATP hydrolysis, was necessary for formation of one or more critical early complexes. Initiation by shifting complete reaction mixtures (assembled on ice but without 20-min prior incubation) to 37 °C yielded excision and error correction time courses (20Wang H. Hays J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26136-26142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) that generally lagged Mg2+-initiated but led ATP-initiated reactions (data not shown). We measured the stable commitment to error correction, as resistance to 25-fold excess competitor DNA added at various times after initiation by addition of ATP or Mg2+. The competitor substrate is similar in size to sCPDC(g/t)n and contains a nick 3′ to a G/T mismatch, but error correction does not restore an AseI endonuclease recognition site (21Wang H. Hays J.B. Mol. Biotechnol. 2000; 15: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The representative analyses shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that competitor and corrected product DNA can be quantitatively resolved, and Fig. 2 shows early ATP- and Mg2+-initiated commitment time courses. Addition of competitor substrate concomitantly with initiation blocked correction of substrate sCPDC(g/t)n; stable competitor-resistant commitment was observed as early as 30 s after initiation. Committed complexes formed substantially sooner in Mg2+-initiated reactions than in ATP-initiated reactions (Fig. 2). In the absence of competitor, corrected products already appear as early as 80 s after Mg2+ initiation (Fig.1), so we did not extend the competitor challenge experiments beyond 90 s. However, the data in Figs. 2 and3 (Table I) show that within 60–75 s after Mg2+ addition, stable complexes have nearly reached a plateau (corresponding to roughly one-half of the final yield of corrected product in the absence of competitor). Interestingly, the lag between ATP-initiated and Mg2+-initiated committed complex formation (Fig. 2) is roughly 30 s at the half-maximal point, similarly to error correction (Fig. 1, open symbols). The solid linein Fig. 2 corresponds to the projected time course for 3′ to 5′ excision of the first nucleotides, calculated from initial rates of Mg2+-initiated 3′ to 5′ excision assayed 147–178 nt downstream from the nick in two different experiments (Figs. 1 and4) but extrapolated to the first 30 nt downstream of the nick using an excision progress rate of 5.2 nt/s (Fig. 4, open versus filled squares). Formation of stable committed complexes thus reproducibly precedes actual excision by roughly 15 s. To further investigate requirements for stable commitment, we varied the timing and nature of nucleotide addition (Fig. 3 and Table I). Addition of Mg2+to an otherwise complete reaction mixture assembled on ice followed by 75-s incubation at 37 °C (Experiment 2, Fig. 3 and Table I) generated the same relative yield of stable committed complexes as shown in Fig. 2. However, if there was no opportunity for ATP hydrolysis before challenge with competitor substrate, error correction was negligible, either because 1) there was no time at 37 °C, whether only ATP (Experiment 1) or both ATP and Mg2+(Experiment 7) were present on ice well before concomitant competitor addition (with Mg2+, in Experiment 1) and temperature shift or 2) Mg2+ was absent during 37 °C incubation before competitor challenge (Experiment 8). The inference that stable commitment requires ATP hydrolysis was strengthened by the absence of error correction when competitor (and ATP) were added 75 s after incubation with Mg2+ and ATPγS at 37 °C (Experiment 4). Interestingly, ATP added after 75 s at 37 °C but before competitor challenge another 75 s later appeared able to partially displace ATPγS and generate (in the presence of Mg2+) some stable committed complexes (Experiment 5). The converse was not true, however: addition of ATPγS with competitor after 75 s at 37 °C (with Mg2+)) only slightly reduced the level of stable committed complexes generated with ATP (Experiment 3).Figure 2Time courses of stable commitment to MMR error-correction.

Preliminary experiments showed that aphidicolin similarly inhibited 3′ to 5′ excision time courses whether or not exogenous dNTPs were withheld (data not shown), so subsequent studies focused on aphidicolin effects in the absence of exogenous dNTPs. We first analyzed nick-initiated 3′ to 5′ excision during reactions synchronized by Mg2+addition in the absence of aphidicolin, using probes complementary to the continuous strand at positions proximal and distal to the nick (respectively, 32–61 and 147–178 nt downstream from the nick) to measure gaps along the shorter nick-mispair path (Fig. 4,open and filled squares).

N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor glutathioneS-transferase dithiothreitol adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) soluble NSF attachment protein receptors Proteins of the AAA (ATPases associated with cellular activities) family share a common amino acid sequence motif known as the AAA domain. This domain is characterized by a sequence of 230–250 amino acids surrounding the Walker A and B boxes, which are responsible for ATP binding and hydrolysis (1Confalonieri F. Duguet M. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 2Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AAA proteins have diverse functions ranging from proteolysis-coupled unfoldase activity to membrane trafficking (3Karata K. Inagawa T. Wilkinson A.J. Tatsuta T. Ogura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26225-26232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Maurizi M.R. a. L., C.C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 980-985Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). There are two types of AAA proteins known. The majority of these proteins contain one ATPase domain and are classified as type I AAA proteins. Others, which are known as type II AAA proteins, contain two such domains (5Beyer A. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2043-2058Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In some type II AAA proteins, the regions surrounding the two Walker boxes are highly homologous to each other, as in the yeast protein Cdc48. In others, only one Walker box-containing region is a bona fideAAA domain, with the other region showing little similarity to the AAA consensus sequence. An example of the latter is protein NSF,1 which participates in heterotypic membrane fusion events. In type II AAA proteins, the first AAA domain, also termed D1, usually serves a different function from the C-terminal (D2) domain (6Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Jaenicke R.

For example, the ATPase activity of the NSF D1 domain is essential for membrane fusion activity, whereas its D2 domain is thought to effect hexamer formation (6Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K.

Many type II AAA proteins form hexameric ring structures (2Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but there are also a few reports of heptamers (10Kessel M. Wu W. Gottesman S. Kocsis E. Steven A.C. Maurizi M.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 11Rohrwild M. Pfeifer G. Santarius U. Muller S.A. Huang H.C. Engel A.

Biol. 2000; 303: 655-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Despite intensive research on AAA proteins ranging from bacteria to mammals, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that underlie their respective activities. In previous work, we have shown that the antibacterial drug diazaborine inhibits growth of yeast cells and that resistance to this inhibitor can be mediated either by allelic forms of transcription factors that activate detoxifying efflux pumps or by allelic forms of the geneDRG1, which codes for a AAA protein (13Wendler F. Bergler H. Prutej K. Jungwirth H. Zisser G. Kuchler K. Högenauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27091-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Drg1p is a type II AAA protein that is essential for the growth ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14Thorsness P.E. White K.H. Ong W.C. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1267-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Its closest homolog in yeast is Cdc48p (15Fröhlich K.U. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1601-1602PubMed Google Scholar). As with Cdc48p, the two AAA domains of Drg1p show strong homology to each other. However, there is a significant difference in the Walker A box in the D2 domain, which contains the sequence GPPGCSKT instead of the consensus sequence GPPGTGKT. In addition, Drg1p contains a leucine zipper motif in its C terminus. We have recently shown that diazaborine treatment of yeast leads to the generation of long, aberrant, mRNA molecules and that in a resistant strain that carries an allelic form of DRG1, the aberrant mRNAs are absent (16Jungwirth H. Bergler H. Högenauer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 36419-36424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We thus concluded that Drg1p is involved in a quality control or degradation mechanism of mRNA. To improve our understanding of the properties of this protein, we constructed mutant forms of Drg1p. These protein varieties as well as the wild type protein were purified from cells expressing the appropriate genes. We then studied the enzymatic activities of the purified proteins, measured ATP binding, and examined the oligomeric structures of the purified proteins by electron microscopy and centrifugation experiments. The resulting data are reported in this article. To clone gene DRG1 into pYEX4T-1 (CLONTECH) a BamHI restriction site was introduced by amplifying the N-terminal portion of the gene between the ATG codon and the XbaI site with the primers pAn1 (5′-TATGGATCCCCGATGGCTCCTAAATCTA) and TonPCR3e (CCTTACATACCTCCTTTTTCAT-5′). As a template pGZ253 was used, which contains a SacI/SpeI fragment with the whole wild type DRG1 gene in pBluescript II KS+. The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and XbaI and cloned into pBluescript to produce pAZ1. TheXbaI/SpeI fragment of pGZ253 containing the C-terminal portion of DRG1 from the XbaI site toward the end of the gene was then inserted into theXbaI-cleaved pAZ1 to yield pAZ2. The correct orientation of the construct was confirmed by restriction analysis. Finally, theBamHI/NotI fragment of pAZ2, containing the entire DRG1 gene, was cloned into theBamHI/NotI cleaved expression vector pYEX4T-1, resulting in the recombinant plasmid pAZ3. This plasmid expresses a GST-Drg1 fusion protein under the control of the CUP1promotor. The GST moiety can be removed from the fusion protein by thrombin cleavage. However, treatment of the fusion protein with thrombin resulted in ∼10% unspecific cleavage products. Therefore, the thrombin cleavage site encoded by pAZ3 was exchanged for a PreScission protease recognition site. This was done by substitution of a MscI/BamHI fragment from pAZ3 by a MscI/BamHI fragment from the vector pGEX-6P-1 (Amersham Biosciences). These fragments contain the C-terminal part of the GST gene, a part of the polylinker, and the sequence coding for the thrombin or the PreScission protease recognition site, respectively. The resulting plasmid was designated pAZ7, and the correct nucleotide sequence of the whole DRG1reading frame was confirmed by sequencing. For construction of pAZ8, a 1.6-kb BglII/NotI fragment in pAZ7 was substituted for the respective fragment from pGZ223, which contains the diazaborine-resistant allele ofDRG1 in pBluescript II KS−. pAZ9 was constructed by exchanging a BglII/NcoI fragment in pAZ7 by the respective fragment from pRS320, which contains the temperature-sensitive afg2-18 allele. pES2 and pES3 were constructed by cloning the 601-nucleotide internalBglII/SalI fragment after PCR amplification with chromosomal DTY4 (drg1-sup) DNA as a template into pAZ7 or pAZ9, respectively. The respective constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The mutations leading to the C561T, the S562G, and the C561T/S562G exchanges in Drg1p were introduced by site-specific mutagenesis into pGZ253 using the ChameleonTM double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the mutagenic primers C561T (GGG CCG CCA GGT ACC TCC AAG ACA TTA ACC), S562G (GGG CCG CCA GGT TGC GGC AAG ACA TTA ACC), and C561T/S562G (AG GGG CCG CCA GGT ACC GGC AAG ACA TTA ACC GC). The expression plasmids were finally constructed by exchanging the BglII/SpeI restriction fragment of pAZ7 for the respective fragments of the cloned mutated forms ofDRG1. For induced expression of GST-Drg1p transformants of the yeast strain BY4743 Mat a/α (drg1::kanMX4/DRG1) (Euroscarf) were grown for 18 h at 30 °C in minimal synthetic medium containing histidine, lysine, and tryptophan. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g, 5 min), resuspended in the same medium, and grown for 2 h to restore log phase growth. Expression was induced by the addition of cupric sulfate to 0.5 mm, and the cultures were maintained for 6–8 h before harvest. The cells were resuspended in 100 mm Tris-sulfate buffer, pH 9.4, and treated with 10 mm DTT at 30 °C for 10 min. After washing, the cells were suspended in 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1.2 m sorbitol and 2 mg of Zymolyase 20T (Seikagaku Corp.)/1 g of cell wet weight and incubated at 30 °C for 45 min. The spheroplasts were washed once with sorbitol solution and resuspended in 0.6 m mannitol in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4. The spheroplasts were disrupted by 30 strokes in a Potter-Elvejhem homogenizer. After removal of unbroken cells and cell debris by low speed centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min. The crude extract from 1 liter of culture was stirred into 0.5 ml of settled glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 1 h. After removal of unspecifically bound proteins by washing with cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), 25 units of PreScission protease (AmershamBiosciences)/0.5 ml of settled beads were added, and the beads were incubated with gentle agitation at 5 °C for 4 h. PreScission protease consists of a fusion protein of human rhinovirus 3C protease and GST, which permits the simultaneous digestion of the GST-Drg1p fusion protein and removal of both GST and the protease from the Drg1p moiety. The eluate containing Drg1p was separated from the PreScission protease and the glutathione-agarose matrix by centrifugation. ATPase activity was determined by measuring the amount of [α-32P]ATP converted to ADP. 5 μg of purified protein was incubated in 50 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP (800 Ci/mmol)) at 30 °C for 15 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 μl of a chloroform-methanol (2:1) mixture. The samples were analyzed by thin layer chromatography on polyethyleneimine-cellulose F plates with 1m LiCl as developing solvent. After separation, the substrate and product were quantitated with a PhosphorImager. Binding of [α-32P]ATP to Drg1p was determined by the filtration method as described by Matveevaet al. (8Matveeva E.A., He, P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26413-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, between 1 nm and 500 μm[α-32P]ATP, and 0.3 nmol of purified Drg1 protein was incubated for 10 min at room temperature and filtered through a nitrocellulose membrane (MicronSep, 0.45 μm; Osmonics Inc.). The membrane was washed five times with 2.5 ml of ice-cold washing buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 150 mmNaCl. The radioactivity retained at the membrane was counted in 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture in a Beckmann SC4500 liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. The data were analyzed for binding constants using Prism 3.02 software from Graphpad Software Inc. by nonlinear fitting or by determining the intercepts with the abscissa and the ordinate in a Scatchard plot. Binding of diazaborine to Drg1p was performed by a technique similar to the ATP binding assay. 100 μg of purified Drg1p was incubated in the presence of 20 μg/ml radiolabeled diazaborine in a reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT for 10 min at room temperature. All other steps were performed as described above. Drops of purified wild type or mutant Drg1p at a protein concentration of ∼20 μg/ml in the buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm KCl, 25 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm ATPγS (or 5 mm ATP, in some experiments) were applied to continuous carbon films mounted on electron microscopy grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. The grids were examined in a CM120 electron microscope (FEI, Mahwah, NJ) operating at 100 kV. The micrographs were recorded at a nominal magnification of 35,000× and digitized at a step size of 7 μm (0.20 nm/pixel) on a SCAI scanner (Z/I Imaging, Huntsville, AL). For digital analysis, the particles were picked using the semi-automatic procedure, X3DPREPROCESS (17Conway J.F. Trus B.L. Booy F.P. Newcomb W.W. Brown J.C. Steven A.C. J Struct Biol. 1993; 111: 222-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Alignment and correlation averaging was performed using PIC-III (18Trus B.L. Kocsis E. Conway J.F. Steven A.C. J Struct Biol. 1996; 116: 61-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). 400 particles of wild type Drg1p, 260 of the diazaborine-resistant mutant and 200 of the C561T/S562G double mutant were averaged. The resolution according to the SSNR criterion (19Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) was 23, 31, and 41 Å, respectively. Rotational symmetry analysis was carried out with the ROTASTAT program (20Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). 50–100 μg of purified Drg1p was layered on the top of a 11-ml 10–25% (w/v) linear glycerol gradient in gradient buffer (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT). After centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 24 h at 4 °C, 0.8-ml fractions were collected by piercing the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The relative sedimentation velocity of Drg1p was determined by comparison of gradient profiles with a calibration curve prepared from the sedimentation data of the marker proteins bovine serum albumin (4.6 S), catalase (11.4 S), and α-2-macroglobulin (20 S) under identical conditions. To investigate the influence of the two AAA domains of Drg1p on its ATPase activity and structural properties, we generated a number of mutants. We obtained the thermosensitiveafg2-18 mutant (21Nunnari J. Marshall W.F. Straight A. Murray A. Sedat J.W. Walter P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1233-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) and characterized it by sequencing. The mutation results from a L457S exchange at a position roughly midway between the two AAA domains (Fig. 1). The mutant DNA was introduced into the chromosomal DNA of strain W303 by homologous recombination. The resulting strain no longer grew at 37 °C, but growth was observed after shifting down to the permissive temperature of 25 °C. The temperature-sensitive phenotype could be reversed by overexpression of either the wild type or the temperature-sensitive protein itself. Experiments not shown here demonstrated that 2.5-fold overexpression of the temperature sensitive protein was sufficient to restore growth at 37 °C. We obtained suppressor mutants by mutagenizing the thermosensitive strain with ethyl methane sulfonate and screening for colonies that grew at the nonpermissive temperature. After eliminating revertants, we isolated and identified one intragenic suppressor mutant (drg1-sup). It contained a second amino acid exchange,i.e. F343L, in the Walker B box of the D1 AAA domain. We introduced this mutation into the wild type allele by fragment swapping. The resulting allele was designated “sup*.” A strain containing this mutation in DRG1 showed no growth phenotype compared with wild type. We also generated mutants in the Walker A box of the D2 domain. The sequence of this motif is GPPGCSKT, which deviates in two positions from the consensus GPPGTGKT sequence. We introduced single amino acid exchanges by site-specific mutagenesis to render the D2 sequence more similar to the D1 sequence and also created a double mutant to make the sequences identical in this region. The substitutions were C561T and S562G for the single exchange and C561T/S562G for the double exchange. The S562G mutant protein variant did not support growth of yeast cells and is thus considered nonfunctional. We also mutated the lysine residues of the Walker A boxes of both AAA domains. In both cases, yeast cells carrying these alleles were observed to show normal growth. Because Drg1p is a low abundance protein, we expressed theDRG1 gene as a GST fusion protein to facilitate its purification. The expression system is based on a modified pYEX4T-1 vector (see “Materials and Methods”). The constructed plasmid was designated pAZ7 and expressed the GST-Drg1p fusion protein under the control of the CUP1 promoter. The plasmid codes for the recognition sequence of the PreScission protease instead of the original thrombin cleavage site juxtaposed to the polylinker. This strategy resulted in significantly less degradation products when the Drg1 moiety was released from the fusion protein by protease treatment. pAZ8, pAZ9, pES3, and pES2 are derivatives of pAZ7, respectively, containing the diazaborine-resistant drg1-1 allele, the temperature-sensitive afg2-18 allele, the suppressor (drg1-sup) allele, and the allele containing only the F343L exchange (drg1-sup*). pES21, pES22, and pES23 are derivatives of pAZ7 containing the C561T, the S562G, and the C561T/S562G exchanges that were generated by site-specific mutagenesis. To express the GST-Drg1p fusion proteins, yeast cells carrying the respective recombinant plasmids were incubated in Cu2+-containing selective medium. The highest expression was obtained 6–8 h after induction. The crude extracts were prepared as described under “Materials and Methods,” and the fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-agarose beads by a batch procedure. The Drg1 moiety of the fusion protein was separated from GST by treatment with PreScission protease. The yield of Drg1p was ∼1 mg of protein/liter of culture. SDS-PAGE of the purified protein is shown in Fig. 2. Separation of this protein preparation by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with subsequent silver staining and Western blotting with anti-Drg1p and anti-GST antibodies showed that the faintly stained protein bands discernible in Fig. 2 are degradation products of the fusion protein (data not shown). We also purified the proteins encoded by other allelic forms ofDRG1 by the same procedure. The proteins encoded by the diazaborine-resistant allele drg1-1 and by the C561T/S562G allele were obtained in yields similar to the wild type protein. Lower yields were obtained for the proteins encoded by the temperature-sensitive afg2-18 allele, the suppressor alleledrg1-sup, and the C561T and S562G alleles. This observation may reflect reduced stability of the mutant proteins. We also attempted to express and isolate the proteins with K292E and K536E exchanges, but in neither case could the fusion protein be detected, which may reflect highly unstable conformations. Purified wild type Drg1p and the various mutant forms were assayed for ATPase activity, using [α-32P]ATP as a substrate. The reaction product ADP was separated by TLC on polyethyleneimine-cellulose plates and quantified with a PhosphorImager. The results are shown in Fig.3. The protein encoded by the diazaborine-resistant allele exhibits 71% of the wild type ATPase activity, whereas the ATPase activity of the C561T mutant was decreased to 35%. The C561T/S562G double mutant in which the second Walker A box is identical to the first one and the S562G single mutant showed much higher activities than the wild type protein. The proteins encoded by the temperature-sensitive and the suppressor alleles showed ∼10 times lower activities than the wild type protein. This observation was surprising because the suppressor mutation compensates the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype in whole cells. The protein containing only the F343L exchange (encoded by the drg1-sup* allele), which is located in the Walker B box of the first ATP-binding domain, reduced the ATPase activity to ∼60% of the wild type protein. Preincubation of wild type Drg1p at 37 °C in reaction buffer without ATP resulted in inactivation of its ATPase activity. As a control, we incubated the protein at 25 or 30 °C for the same period. No inactivation was observed. However, preincubation in the presence of ATP at 37 °C preserved the enzymatic activity of the protein (Fig.3). Thus, ATP seems to exert a stabilizing influence on the protein structure. NSF and some other AAA proteins are sensitive to treatment withN-ethylmaleimide (22Wilson D.W. Wilcox C.A. Flynn G.C. Chen E. Kuang W.J. Henzel W.J. Block M.R. Ullrich A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1989; 339: 355-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 23Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we tested for a possible sensitivity of Drg1p to this agent and found that its ATPase activity is reduced by 90% by 1 mm N-ethylmaleimide (data not shown). This suggests the existence of exposed sulfhydryl groups important for the ATPase activity of Drg1p. Because allelic forms of DRG1 confer resistance to diazaborine, we investigated whether the drug affects the ATPase activity of the purified protein. The ATPase activity of wild type Drg1p was not inhibited by diazaborine in concentrations up to 100 μg/ml. We also tested whether the purified protein could bind the radiolabeled drug. This was done by equilibrium dialysis and by filter binding studies in the presence and absence of ATP or NAD+. In no case was binding of the radiolabeled drug detected (data not shown). We also determined the kinetic constants for wild type Drg1p. The protein exhibited ATPase activity with aKm(app) for ATP of 35 μmand a specific activity of 1 μmol of ATP/h/mg of protein (∼9 ATP/min/hexamer). This specific activity is in the same range as for other AAA ATPases (23Patel S. Latterich M. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 65-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained for the diazaborine-resistant drg1-1 mutant protein (Fig.4), indicating that the V725E exchange does not significantly alter the kinetic properties of the protein. To study the binding of ATP to Drg1p, we used a nitrocellulose filter binding assay (8Matveeva E.A., He, P. Whiteheart S.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26413-26418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Purified wild type protein was incubated in the presence of various concentrations of [α-32P]ATP for 10 min at room temperature and then passed through a nitrocellulose filter. Protein-bound radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Drg1p exhibited a biphasic behavior of nucleotide binding, indicating the presence of two ATP-binding sites with different binding constants. Using Scatchard analysis, we estimated the binding constants to be 27 and 88 μm, respectively. Thus, Drg1p has one high affinity site and one low affinity site for binding ATP (Fig. 5). To determine which of the two ATP-binding sites is responsible for the substrate binding with the higher affinity, we purified the mutant protein variant with the C561T/S562G exchange in the C-terminal Walker A box and measured ATP binding. A Scatchard analysis showed that both binding sites in this protein variant behaved similarly in that they bound ATP with association constants of 110 μm (Fig. 5). We thus conclude that the amino acid exchanges in the Walker box of the D2 region altered the high affinity binding site for ATP into a low affinity site. The structures of wild type and mutant Drg1p in buffer containing 1 mm ATPγS were examined by electron microscopy and image analysis. Micrographs of negatively stained wild type protein revealed rings with diameters of ∼120 Å (Fig.6a). Application of two statistical tests for rotational symmetry (20Kessel M. Maurizi M.R. Kim B. Kocsis E. Trus B.L. Singh S.K. Steven A.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) revealed a definite 6-fold symmetry (Table I). The Student's t test indicated that the probability that the 6-fold signal could have arisen at random is extremely low (p ≪ 10−6; see Table I). The spectral ratio product, which maintains values >1 for positive detection of a given symmetry and converges toward 0 otherwise, diverged to the very large value of 7.0 × 10300 for 6-fold symmetry with this data set. No other symmetry was found to be significant by either test. These observations imply that most if not all of the molecules are hexamers. Image averaging confirmed the hexameric arrangement (Fig.6a, inset). In the top views (Fig. 6,insets), Drg1p appears as a scalloped hexagon with a maximum radius (i.e. the distance from the center to the vertex of the hexagon) of 70 Å and a minimum radius of 55 Å. There is a heavy accumulation of stain at its center (diameter, ∼20 Å), suggesting the presence of an axial channel or internal cavity. Faintly staining features curve outwards from the center, giving the particle a marked handedness. Wild type Drg1p was also visualized in the same way in the presence of 5 mm ATP. However, no obvious structural change was seen in the averaged top view (data not shown).Table ISummary of statistical tests to detect 6-fold symmetry of the wild type Drg1 protein and two mutants from negatively stained electron micrographsProteinProbability from Student's ttestRadiusSpectral ratio productGeometrical meannÅWild type≪10−642–547.0 × 103004.9478Drg1–1p≪10−642–546.0 × 101012.4269C561T/S562G≪10−648–601.0 × 10892.8200The second row gives an upper boundary for the probability that the observed 6-fold symmetry could have arisen from random noise.

Biochemical studies have shown that IRSp53 interacts with many proteins that fall into two classes. The first class is transmembrane receptors, and the interacting proteins are the insulin receptor (Tyr kinase) (1Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (G protein-coupled receptor) (2Oda K. Shiratsuchi T. Nishimori H. Inazawa J. Yoshikawa H. Taketani Y. Nakamura Y. Tokino T. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1999; 84: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Cell culture studies show that hamster IRSp53 is phosphorylated by activated forms of human insulin and insulin receptor-related receptors, as well as by the Drosophilainsulin receptor (1Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Rat brain insulin receptors are highly enriched in postsynaptic fractions (3Abbott M.A. Wells D.G. Wells D.G. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In cultured hippocampal neurons, IRSp53 and insulin receptors are co-localized to postsynaptic densities. The functional effects of insulin/ insulin-like growth factor 1-induced phosphorylation of IRSp53 are not known.The second class of IRSp53-binding proteins is involved in stimulus-mediated actin and microtubule cytoskeletal reorganization (reviewed in Ref. 4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 2: 241-255Crossref Scopus (1660) Google Scholar). Those proteins are three Rho family GTPases (Rho, Rac, and cdc42) and three Rho family effectors (mDia, WAVE2, and Mena). Two regions of IRSp53 have been shown to interact with GTPases. Rac binds in the helical domain (somewhere in the N-terminal 229 aa) (5Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) and cdc42 binds in a partial CRIB domain that is 16 aa downstream of the helical domain (6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Unbound IRSp53 has an inaccessible SH3 domain. Activated forms of GTPases bind IRSp53 and allow its SH3 domain to bind effectors, resulting in various types of actin filament dynamics. Studies show that, through interactions with IRSp53, Rho activates mDia, Rac activates WAVE2, and cdc42 activates Mena (5Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr.

Commun. 2000; 271: 626-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, IRSp53 is an adaptor that couples activators (Rho GTPases) and effectors (Arp2/3-activators).IRSp53 also interacts with atrophin-1, a protein of unknown function that causes dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy when its polyQ sequence is expanded (9Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Ohmi K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). PolyQ expansions in atrophin-1 result in a reduced affinity for IRSp53. A key puzzle regarding polyQ disease is how widely expressed mutant proteins can lead to highly tissue-specific cell death. We showed that IRSp53 and atrophin-1 are coexpressed in some cells, e.g. in medium spiny neurons of the striatum (10Thomas E.A. Foye P.E. Alvarez C.E. Usui H. Sutcliffe J.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although IRSp53 mRNA is expressed widely throughout the body, it is very strongly enriched in the forebrain and, to a lesser extent, the cerebellum, tissues that are affected in various types of polyQ neurodegeneration (EST SE23B in Ref. 11Usui H. Falk J.D. Dopazo A. de Lecea L. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (10Thomas E.A. Foye P.E. Alvarez C.E. Usui H. Sutcliffe J.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We and others have speculated that the role of IRSp53 in polyQ disease may not be restricted to dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (9Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Ohmi K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 10Thomas E.A. Foye P.E. Alvarez C.E. Usui H. Sutcliffe J.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).IRSp53 originally was identified as IRSp53/p58, a hamster insulin receptor substrate of 53 and 58 kDa (1Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There is a protein family with the same activity and name, IRS. IRSp53 is not a member of the IRS gene family. The N-terminal half of the protein is an IRSp53-specific domain predicted to be almost purely helical. Although there are yeast homologs of Rho GTPases, of IRSp53 effectors, and of another IRSp53-related adaptor (WIP), there is no compelling yeast homolog of IRSp53. There is one candidate yeast homolog, Hof1p, which has an SH3 domain and a weak match to a small portion of the helical domain, but the most divergent species from mammals that has a clear IRSp53 homolog isDrosophila (this study). Flies have one IRSp53gene, and humans have two (the second is IRSp53-L).Four isoforms of human and rat IRSp53 have been characterized by Western blotting analysis (12Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These forms are mediated by alternative splicing of the 3′-terminal exon; they have identical sequences for the first 511 aa followed by unique sequences of 9–41 aa. It is not clear what the functional significance of these alternative forms is. We report here the discovery of a novel alternatively spliced isoform that lacks 40 aa in the CRIB/SH3-binding region. This novel form has a curious history in the mammalian lineage, which may complicate the study of human cytoskeletal reorganization in rodent model systems. The location and biochemical profile of the alternative sequence suggest that it is involved in protein binding. We speculate that the affected domain is involved in the autoinactivation mechanism of IRSp53 function.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONIn the process of isolating a reference cDNA sequence of mouseIRSp53 (10Thomas E.A. Foye P.E. Alvarez C.E. Usui H. Sutcliffe J.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), we found a novel isoform (Fig.1). We performed RT-PCR with mouse whole brain cDNA using primers near the translational start site and in the 3′-untranslated regions of IRSp53–1. We cloned the PCR products and sequenced one clone that is nearly identical to hamster and human IRSp53 but is 120 bp shorter in the middle. We then examined other clones and found that we had isolated two cDNA species of IRSp53, one with and one without the 120-bp segment. The full-length forms of mouse and human IRSp53 are 87% identical (over the entire coding sequence) at the DNA level and 96% identical (over the entire 522 aa) at the amino acid level. It is notable that these genes have evolved independently for 160 million years (they shared a common ancestor approximately 80 million years ago). Considering the fact that the third positions of codons are degenerate, 87% conservation of 1569 bp is highly unusual. This suggests that the third position conservation throughout the length of the transcript is due to RNA secondary structure constraints (presumably involved in RNA stability, localization, or regulation).We confirmed the existence of these two forms by designing primers that span the alternative 120-bp region and repeating the RT-PCR of mouse whole brain cDNA (Fig. 2). We observed both cDNA species on agarose gels. Those two products were isolated individually from agarose gels, reamplified, and sequenced directly. The two forms correspond to the two clones we had initially sequenced. As previous studies have referred to one of the 3′-terminal alternatively spliced mRNAs as the “short form,” we have named the new one the “B form.” We reasoned that it is the simplest way of referring to the novel alternative position in combination with the four alternative 3′-terminal exons (the forms we cloned areIRSp53-A1 and -B1).We examined this novel alternative splice by RT-PCR of various mouse tissues (Fig. 2 A). The levels of IRSp53 mRNA are highly elevated in specific regions of the brain (10Thomas E.A. Foye P.E. Alvarez C.E. Usui H. Sutcliffe J.G. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 309: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 11Usui H. Falk J.D. Dopazo A. de Lecea L. Erlander M.G. Sutcliffe J.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 4915-4926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), so we focused our analysis on the brain. We find that the two forms are expressed in both the brain and periphery. In each tissue we examined, the levels of the B form are small to moderate fractions of total IRSp53 levels. However, the relative amount of the two species cannot be discerned from these highly saturated PCR experiments. To test for tissue-specific regulation of this alternative splicing phenomenon, we selected cDNAs of apparent low and medium relative IRSp53-B levels and performed a quantitative version of the same assay. Fig. 2 B shows that the levels ofIRSp53 are highly variable between different tissues, roughly 3% in liver and 30% in whole brain. This finding suggests that we are not studying a stochastic process based on the relative strength of the two alternative splice sites but, rather, a regulated alternative splice.There is confusion regarding the identity of IRSp53 protein species observed by SDS-PAGE analysis. There are two predominant species seen in various rodent tissues (1Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Abbott M.A. Wells D.G. Wells D.G. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); one has an apparent mass of 53 kDa and the other of 58 kDa. The molecular bases of the two protein species are not clear. We made protein expression constructs placing the T7 promoter in front of IRSp53-A and -B and performed coupled in vitro transcription/translation. The translation products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (Fig. 3). We found that the two forms have mobilities corresponding to masses of 53 and 58 kDa.Figure 3SDS-PAGE analysis of recombinant IRSp53-A and -B. Mouse IRSp53-A1 and -B1 were cloned downstream of the T7 promoter. Those constructs were used to perform coupled in vitro transcription/translation with [35S]Met. The recombinant products were analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE along with a “no DNA” control (Ctrl). The protein standards were detected by Coomassie Blue staining. The gel was dried and autoradiographed. Protein standards were used to size the recombinant products. The two products have predicted masses of 58 (IRSp53-A) and 53 (IRSp53-B) kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We were able to isolate the corresponding genomic region of the mouseIRSp53 by PCR because the intron flanking the alternative sequence is exceptionally short (Figs. 4and 5 D). Mapping of the alternatively spliced DNA sequence to the genomic sequence reveals that the alternative sequence is not an independent exon but rather is an extension of the downstream exon. The gene structure of IRSp53 (data not shown) reveals that it is exon 9 that has two alternative 3′ splice sites. We examined the two mouse splice sites for clues about regulation. There are two mechanisms that would explain the varying ratios of A/B forms: activation of one splice site or blocking of the other. Comparison of the two sites weakly favors the later model. When the consensus matching of 3′ splice sites is equal, as it is in this case, the strength of splice sites can be attributed to the pyrimidine density of the polypyrimidine (polyPy) tract. We observe that the A splice site has a very strong polyPy tract (Py density of 14/15 or 18/20 bases), and the B splice site has a slightly weaker tract (13/14 or 16/20). The splice site qualities alone would predict an approximately fixed ratio of the two forms, with the A form dominating. That is, the A splice site is very robust, it is stronger than the B site, and it is upstream of the B site. Our finding that the B form may be predominant in some tissues (thalamus, Fig.5 A) hints that this alternative splicing may be regulated by blocking of the A site.Figure 4Analysis of mouse and human IRSp53 alternative A and B splice sites.

The same PCR assay used to analyze alternative splicing of mouse IRSp53-A/B (Fig. 2) was used to assay cDNA and genomic DNA from closely and distantly related mammals.A, RT-PCR of rat tissue cDNAs shows that both the A and B forms are present and at relative levels similar to that seen in mouse. Thalamus appears to be the only tissue we have examined in mouse or rat that has more of the B form than the A form.

The human A and B consensus-matching splice sites (not including polyPy tracts) are perfectly conserved with those of the mouse, but the relative strengths of the two human polyPy tracts are more difficult to quantify. The A site polyPy tract appears to be very slightly stronger (A splice site is 14/16 or 17/20 and B is 13/14 or 16/20). However, it should be noted that, unlike the case for most exons, the B splice site and polyPy tract are located in the coding sequence. The mouse/human conservation of DNA sequence in this region could be because of alternative splicing and/or protein sequence conservation. Based on this analysis alone, we would predict the human gene to have the same alternatively spliced B form.Previous protein studies have shown abundant p53 and p58 forms of IRSp53 in hamsters, rats, and mice (i.e. in rodents) (1Yeh T.C. Ogawa W. Danielsen A.G. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2921-2928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 3Abbott M.A. Wells D.G. Wells D.G. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the levels of p53 in pig brain are barely detectable (3Abbott M.A. Wells D.G. Wells D.G. Fallon J.R. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although there are reports of p53 in humans, it is not precisely clear what the identity and/or SDS-PAGE mobility of this species is (5Miki H. Yamaguchi H. Suetsugu S. Takenawa T. Nature. 2000; 408: 732-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 9Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Ohmi K. Yamada M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 947-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,12Okamura-Oho Y. Miyashita T. Miyashita T. Yamada M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 957-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We looked for the novel alternative splice in near and distant mammalian relatives of the mouse, e.g. rats and humans (with approximate divergence times of 10 and 80 million years, respectively). cDNAs from various rat and human tissues were tested with the same RT-PCR assay used with mouse (the primer sequences are conserved in the rodent, bovine, and primate species examined here). The B form is present in rats but not in humans (Fig. 5, A andB). We increased the levels of human cDNA templates and the PCR cycle numbers to approximately single-molecule detection levels and did not detect IRSp53-B in any human tissue. Cow and monkey whole brain cDNAs were tested and also showed no evidence ofIRSp53-B (Fig. 5 C).It is possible that the eighth intron of rodents is so small that it reduces the splicing efficiency of the A splice site, which would lead to an increased use of the nearest downstream site. We examined this intron in IRSp53 from other mammals and found that primates and rodents share a small intron size, but that this is not a conserved mammalian feature (Fig. 5 D). Thus, the rodent and primate introns are exceptionally short, and the cow and dog introns appear to be much larger. The size of the eighth intron does not appear to be related to the presence of the alternative B form (i.e. humans have a small intron but no form B). These findings indicate that there may have been accelerated evolution in this IRSp53 gene region in the mammalian lineage.We studied the IRSp53 protein sequence for clues about function (Fig.1). The partial or variant CRIB domain has been characterized functionally (6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 7Krugmann S. Jordens I. Gevaert K. Driessens M. Vandekerckhove J. Hall A. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1645-1655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), and the SH3-binding domain has been noted previously (14Yeh T.C., Li, W. Keller G.A. Roth R.A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), but we wish to note two observations. First, the CRIB domain and the SH3-binding site overlap and may represent two functional modes of the same site. Second, although the SH3-binding site has been referred to as a PxxP sequence (i.e. a common sequence), it is a perfect Class I SH3-binding site (N to C terminally, a basic aa followed by two iterations of any aa, a hydrophobic aa, and a Pro (reviewed in Ref.15Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Another protein sequence feature that has been described only minimally is the helical domain. The distinguishing characteristic of IRSp53 is its predicted helical domain, but it has never been described beyond that point. The mouse helical domain appears to be primarily composed of three large helices (see “Materials and Methods”). Intriguingly, there is strong sequence conservation in the two short sequences (SQGSK is perfectly conserved) that link the three helices.A search for divergent homologs of mammalian IRSp53 using BLAST analysis yielded a single one, found in Drosophila (CG7624 aa 41–846, GenBankTMAAF50086). We compared it and a protein commonly referred to as the yeast IRSp53 homolog, Hof1p, with the mouse protein. The fly helical domain is 26% identical, 55% similar over 141 aa (with two gaps) to the mammalian domain. The helical region of yeast Hof1p is 26% identical, 48% similar over 75 aa (two gaps) in the same region. However, when that core 75-aa region of mouse IRSp53 (which matches both the yeast and fly candidates) is analyzed with PSI-BLAST against the full nonredundant GenBankTM data base, Drosophila IRSp53 is the only non-chordate match (even after five iterations). The fly SH3 domain sequence is 44% identical, 69% similar to that of the mouse over 58 aa (two gaps). The yeast SH3 domain is 20% identical, 44% similar over 62 aa (two gaps). Finally, we found thatDrosophila and mouse IRSp53 share a verprolin domain. 2C. E. Alvarez, manuscript submitted for publication. The verprolin domain is present only in mammalian isoform 2, establishing it as the ancestor of the four C-terminal alternative forms (it is also present in IRSp53-L). The fact that verprolin domains activate Arp2/3 (reviewed in Ref. 16Higgs H.N. Pollard T.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 649-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) suggests that the ancestral form of IRSp53 directly activates Arp2/3 and that the three other mammalian forms require effectors. Based on protein sequence, it is unclear whether Hof1p is a true homolog of mouse IRSp53, but the fly protein does appear to be one.When we align IRSp53 from Drosophila and mice, the helical, SH3, and verprolin domains align robustly. The next best protein match between fly and mouse IRSp53 corresponds to the CRIB/SH3-binding area (Fig. 6 A). Curiously, the order of the CRIB/SH3-binding site and the SH3 site are reversed in the two species, but the distance between them is the same. The fly site is 90 aa downstream of the SH3 domain, whereas the mammalian site is 90 aa upstream. Protein alignment of the fly site with that of mouse and human IRSp53 and with related sequences, described by Govind et al. (6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), suggest that it is a conserved element (Fig.6 A). Although the sequence homology extends from the CRIB/SH3-binding site to the alternative exon sequence, three of the six matches in the alternative region are not conserved in humans and mice. This portion could be a spurious match or it could be related to the biology difference between rodents and primates (i.e. as this region of IRSp53 in the two species has different biochemical roles).Figure 6CRIB/SH3-binding site conservation and model of IRSp53 activation. A, comparison of theDrosophila IRSp53 CRIB/SH3-binding site with those of mouse and human IRSp53 and with related sequences from other proteins (taken from Ref. 6Govind S. Kozma R. Monfries C. Lim L. Ahmed S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Identical positions between all proteins are shown inblue and between IRSp53 proteins in red. The mouse/human variation is in yellow. On the alignment of all related sequences, fly positions that match non-consensus residues are in gray. The underlined sequence corresponds to the alternatively spliced region that distinguishes form A from B. B, IRSp53 is released from autoinactivation by cdc42 binding in the CRIB/SH3-binding region (black). GTPase cdc42 (G, yellow) binding frees the SH3 domain (green) for Rho family effector (E,pink) binding, which leads to Arp2/3-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization. We propose that autoinactivation may be mediated by the interaction of the SH3-binding site with the SH3 domain. The IRSp53-A/B alternative region (red) may be part of the CRIB/SH3-binding region. Such an extended SH3-binding region could interact directly with the SH3 domain. Alternatively, that region could be necessary for proper folding of the autoinhibited state of IRSp53 or for interaction with other regulatory proteins. We speculate that in each of these scenarios, the most likely functional consequence is that IRSp53 is at least partially constitutively active.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There are two features of the novel splice variant that have functional implications. First, the alternative sequence is only 4 aa from the CRIB/SH3-binding site. The alternative form removes 40 aa abutting that functional domain; it is difficult to imagine that this does not have an effect on the structural context and function of the CRIB/SH3-binding site. Second, the alternative 40 aa is 15% Pro and 20% charged residues, hinting that it is a protein-binding region. It could either be part of the CRIB/SH3-binding site or it could interact with other proteins.CONCLUSIONSIt is widely believed that mammalian proteomes are almost identical and that species variations are mostly due to the regulation of gene expression. Here we report an exception in a highly conserved protein, i.e. protein variation results from regulation of alternative splicing. We observe a novel alternatively spliced form of IRSp53 in rodents but not in cows or primates. It remains to be demonstrated that this form is translated and stable. However, several genetic features suggest that this form is functional: it represents a significant proportion of IRSp53 transcripts, it is highly regulated, and it has evolved unchecked for at least 20 million years of divergence time (in mice and rats). Biochemical considerations are consistent with this possibility and suggest a possible role for the alternative form. It is not yet clear whether the novel form is ancestral and was lost in the human and cow lineages or if it emerged in the rodent lineage.The novel form is the fifth alternatively spliced isoform of IRSp53. The four other forms represent four different C termini. We have proposed that isoform 2 directly activates Arp2/3, whereas the other forms require intermediary effectors.2 The new B form is generated by the in-frame elimination of 40 aa. This alternative region is 4 aa downstream of the partial CRIB/SH3-binding site and 45 aa upstream of the SH3 domain. As the full-length protein is 96% identical between humans and mice, the removal of such a large portion of the protein likely has major functional effects. The fact that the alternative 40 aa are 15% Pro and 20% charged residues suggests this region is involved in protein binding. The location of the alternative sequence, abutting the CRIB/SH3-binding site, hints that it may be part of that functional domain.There is a recurring theme in the activation of various types of Ras superfamily effectors.

The nucleotide sequence encoding this protein deviated from a published sequence in predicting an additional endonexin fold in the fourth annexin domain. In addition, several motifs exclusively shared by other annexins of G. lamblia in their predicted fourth repeat and predicted to be localized on the opposite (concave) surface of the molecule became apparent. Western blots of trophozoite fractions probed with antiserum against the recombinant protein indicated that this annexin, like the other giardial annexins ANX19 and ANX20, associates with phospholipids in the presence of Ca2+. Finally, confocal laser scanning of trophozoites showed that the protein, apart from the median body, was exclusively localized in the eight flagella. Together, these data suggest that ANX21 may function as a Ca2+-regulated structural element linking phospholipid bilayer and underlying axoneme.

Giardia intestinalis,Giardia duodenalis), a group of diplomonadid parasitic protists, is classified as early branching eukaryotes (1Roger A.J. Amer. Nat. 1999; 154: 146-163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). G. lamblia occurs throughout the world and triggers a form of diarrhea called giardiasis (2Adam R.D. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 14: 447-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). Its life cycle consists of two stages: the infective, immobile cyst form that by virtue of its tough cell wall is able to survive the inhospitable conditions of the host's stomach, and the vegetative, mobile trophozoite form that attaches to the epithelial cells of the gut. It does so with the help of a cytoskeletal structure called ventral disk, which probably functions as a suction cup. The ventral disk consists of spiraling microtubuli with flat structural elements called microribbons protruding from them into the cytoplasm (3Kulda J. Nohýnková E. Kreier J.P. Parasitic Protozoa. 2nd Ed. 10. Academic Press, NY1995: 225-422Crossref Google Scholar). The edges of these microribbons contain two proteins that were originally designated as α-giardins (4Peattie D.A. Alonso R.A. Hein A. Caulfield J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2323-2335Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Alonso R.A. Peattie D.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 50: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and shown to be associated with the cytoskeletal fraction by detergent extraction of the insoluble cell pellet (6Crossley R. Holberton D. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 78: 205-231PubMed Google Scholar). Based on their predicted amino acid sequence, they were later identified as members (ANX19 and ANX20) of the annexin (ANX)1 family (7Morgan O.R. Fernandez M.-P. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1995; 12: 967-979PubMed Google Scholar). Annexins are eukaryotic proteins that usually bind to phospholipid bilayers in a Ca2+-dependent manner (for an exception, see Ref. 8Jost M. Zeuschner D. Seemann J. Weber K. Gerke V. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 221-228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and supposedly play a role in Ca2+-dependent membrane dynamics (9Gerke V. Moss E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). They consist of four homologous, mainly α-helical domains folded into a concave/convex shape. In annexins of higher eukaryotes, each of these four domains possesses the canonical repeat GXGTD followed by an aspartate or glutamate residue 38 positions downstream that forms a loop (AB loop) at the convex surface and functions as high affinity (“type II”) Ca2+-binding site (10Seaton B.A. Annexins: Molecular Structure to Cellular Function. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York1996: 15-29Google Scholar). Other Ca2+-binding sites with lower affinity (“type III”) provided by spatially clustered carboxylate groups are likewise positioned at the convex surface of the molecule. Most annexins exhibit an ion channel activity with ion transport assumed to occur through a central pore lined by charged residues, particularly glutamate and arginine (9Gerke V. Moss E.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1357: 129-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Although the giardial annexins ANX19 (11Bauer B. Engelbrecht S. Bakker-Grunwald T. Scholze H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 147-153PubMed Google Scholar) and ANX20, 2M. Hauptmann, unpublished data. in addition to interacting with the cytoskeleton fraction (6Crossley R. Holberton D. J.

Today. 1990; 6: 52-56Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), bind to phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent manner, they lack an endonexin fold and do not exhibit ion channel activity. In a report on the structure of a gene encoding a pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase from G. lamblia, a flanking complementary DNA sequence putatively encoding an additional annexin has been identified (13Townson S.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). To extend the open reading frame and to increase the overall similarity of the predicted ANX21 to other annexins, the authors postulated an insert of an undefined nucleotide at position 9846 of the complementary sequence (14Morgan R.O. Pilar Fernandez M. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We here present a corrected nucleotide sequence predicting a protein with, in its fourth domain, a bona fide endonexin fold on its convex surface and conserved giardin motifs on its concave surface. In trophozoites, ANX21 was exclusively localized in the flagella. These data are consistent with a model in which ANX21 functions as a Ca2+-regulated structural element linking the flagellar membrane and the axoneme. Trophozoites of G. lamblia strain WB-C6 (ATCC 30957) were cultured in Keister's modified TYI-S-33 medium (15Keister D.B. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1983; 77: 487-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested at the end of the logarithmic phase (after 3–4 days), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm K2HPO4, 7.5 mm KH2PO4, pH 6.9), and stored at −20 °C in the presence of 10 μm (final concentration)trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamide- (4-guanidino)butane (E-64), a potent inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh trophozoites using an Elu-Quick kit (Schleicher and Schuell). To amplify the open reading frame flanking that of the pyruvate-ferredoxin oxidoreductase (13Townson S.M. Upcroft J.A. Upcroft P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 79: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), which has been predicted to code for an annexin homologue (14Morgan R.O. Pilar Fernandez M. J. Mol. Evol. 1997; 44: 178-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we constructed the following synthetic oligonucleotide primers (bold, restriction sites for BamH1): 5′-GTTTTTGTGACACTCGAGAGTAAAATGGC-3′ (C1anx21) and 5′-GAATTATTTACACGACTACAACTCGAGAG-3′ (C2anx21). This primer pair frames the full open reading frame from position 318 to 1369 of the DNA sequence deposited in the sequence data base (GenBankTML17221). PCR on genomic DNA as template was performed using Pfu-polymerase (Stratagene, Heidelberg). The PCR profile was as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, 45 cycles with 2 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C, and 1 min at 94 °C, then 2 min at 55 °C, and 5 min at 72 °C. The amplification product was purified using a QIAEx-II-Gel-Extraction-Kit (Qiagen, Hilden Germany) according to the instructions of the manufacturer, subcloned into pBSK, and sequenced by the automated dideoxy chain termination method (MWG Biotech and in house). The sequence was determined twice in both directions. The amplification product was digested withBamH1 and ligated in frame into the multiple cloning site of the expression vector pET16b, which contains a 5′-extension sequence coding for 10 histidine residues (“His-tag”). After transfection of the construct into Escherichia coli BL21 and induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, the overproduced protein product was partially present in the soluble fraction as checked by SDS-PAGE. For purification, the soluble E. coliextract was adjusted to 25 mm imidazole, the mixture applied onto a Ni-NTA column, and the recombinant protein eluted with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, containing 250 mmimidazole. This yielded a >95% pure recombinant protein judging from SDS-PAGE (data not shown), which was sent out for the immunization of rabbits (Eurogentec, Belgium). On a Western blot of an extract ofE. coli containing the recombinant protein and of the purified recombinant protein, the antiserum (1:1000) reacted with a single protein band at an apparent M r 40,500; the same band was detected with antipenta-His antiserum (Qiagen, 1:2000; data not shown). Annexins were isolated from crude trophozoite homogenates by EGTA extraction according to Ref. 16Boustead C.M. Walker J.H. Geisow M.J. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar. Pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For phospholipid binding, 400 μl of 20 mm Hepes brought to pH 7.4 with NaOH containing 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5 mg multilamellar liposomes (brain extract; Sigma) was added to 100 μl of soluble EGTA extract containing 30 μg of protein. The mixture was incubated for 40 min at room temperature under shaking and then centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 ×g. In a parallel experiment, the free Ca2+concentration in the mixture was adjusted to 1 mm, and in control incubations the brain extract was omitted. For isolation of detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal proteins cells were homogenized in the presence of 4 mm Ca2+, the homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 × g, and the pellet fraction subsequently was extracted with 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100. The extract was mixed with an equal volume of ice-cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, and equivalent fractions of the precipitated protein (Triton X-100 extract) and the Triton-insoluble pellet were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Trophozoite flagella were isolated by the method of Clark and Holberton (17Clark J.T. Holberton D.V. Parasitol. Res. 1988; 74: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice by centrifugation in 0.25 m sucrose and resuspended in TMSK buffer consisting of 30 mm Tris, 2.5 mmMgSO4, 0.2 m sucrose, 25 mm KCl, 1 μm E-64, and 0.005% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 7.4. The suspension was homogenized for 1 min with an Ultra-Turrax (Braun Melsungen, Germany). Cell bodies were removed by centrifuging for 10 min at 220 × g in a swingout rotor. The flagella, which were contained in the supernatant, were pelleted at 13,000 × g for 20 min and purified by density gradient centrifugation through a self-forming Percoll gradient. To this end, the crude flagellar fraction was mixed with 10 ml of 40% (v/v) Percoll (Amersham Biosciences) in TMSK buffer and centrifuged for 60 min at 48,000 × g. For calibration, a parallel gradient was run with Percoll density marker beads. Fractions containing flagella (density range between 1.09 and 1.11 g/ml) were diluted with TMSK, and the flagella were pelleted for 5 min at 13,000 ×g and analyzed by Western blotting. SDS-PAGE was performed in the Tris/glycine system of Douglas et al. (18Douglas M. Finkelstein D. Butow R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 56: 58-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) using 10% gels. Proteins were visualized by dispersion staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (19Neuhoff V. Arold N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 88: 255-262Crossref Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). Western blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes was performed according to Ref. 20Matsudaira P J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar in a CAPS/NaOH-buffer, pH 11.0, containing 10% methanol. For immune decoration of the blots, rabbit antiserum against recombinant ANX21 was used in a dilution of 1:1000. As secondary antibodies we used goat anti-rabbit IgG (Pierce; 1:2,000) coupled to peroxidase, and as chromogenic substrate, we used 4-chloro-1-naphthol. Trophozoites were allowed to attach to coverslips at 37 °C, fixed for 7 min with methanol, and permeabilized for 5 min with acetone, both at −20 °C (21Nohynková E. Dráber P. Reischig J. Kulda J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 79: 438-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After rehydrating with PBS for 10 min at room temperature, the cells were incubated with blocking buffer (3% fetal porcine serum in PBS) for 10 min and then were reacted for 1 h with the rabbit anti-ANX21 antiserum (1:10,000 in PBS). After washing three times with PBS the cells were incubated for 1 h in the dark with CY3TM-conjugated anti-rabbit F(ab)2 fragment from sheep (Sigma; 1:100 in PBS) as secondary antibody. As a positive control cells were labeled with a monoclonal antibody against antiacetylated tubulin (mouse IgG2b isotype from Sigma, 1:2000 in PBS) followed by anti-mouse IgG CY3 conjugate F(ab)2 fragment from sheep (Sigma; 1:400 in PBS). After another three washes with PBS the cells were analyzed in a confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss cLSM 410) equipped with an Ar/Kr excitation laser at 568 nm and an emission filter for 590 nm.

While confirming an insert of one base (identified as G), we found its exact position to occur at nucleotide number 9836 rather than 9846, as proposed by Morgan and Fernandez (14Morgan R.O.

Moreover, the corrected predicted C-terminal sequence now shares several sequence motifs with ANX19 and ANX20, namely IT(G/A)M at 268–270 and 272, KXXYK (X stands for a variable residue) at 281–285, DXER at 293–296 and Trp at 311 (Fig. 1).

In most of these sequences a positively charged residue (usually Arg) follows the tryptophan residue at 311. In a molecular model the indole ring of this tryptophan together with the KXXYK motif ends up on the concave surface of the molecule, opposite the endonexin fold (Fig.2), suggesting that these residues could constitute a binding site for a cytoplasmic interaction partner.Figure 2Molecular model of ANX21. The model was computed by the SWISS-MODEL program (31Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9640) Google Scholar) using the coordinates of related annexins and visualized with the WebLabViewer. The fourth domain is marked in dark gray. G. lamblia-specific residues on the concave side of the molecule are labeled. The fourth-domain endonexin fold comprises an extended loop on the convex side of the molecule.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both Southern blot analysis and data base searching indicated that theG. lamblia genome possesses just one nucleotide sequence encoding ANX21 (data not shown). Northern blot analysis confirmed expression of this anx21 gene in trophozoites with a transcript size (∼1050 nt) that leaves ∼40 nt for the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (Fig. 3). To raise anti-ANX21 antibodies we overproduced the recombinant, His-tagged protein heterologously in E. coli (for details, see “Experimental Procedures”). Probing of Western blots with the antiserum raised against the recombinant protein confirmed that ANX21 is present in trophozoites (Fig. 4).Figure 4Phospholipid binding of trophozoite ANX21 and its association with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction. A, phospholipid binding of ANX21 obtained by EGTA extraction of crude trophozoite homogenate. Multilamellar liposomes prepared from brain extract phospholipids were added in the absence (lanes 1–2) or presence (lanes 3–4) of 1 mm free Ca2+; the supernatant (s) and pellet (p) fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted, and probed with anti-ANX21 antiserum. Lanes 5–6show control without phospholipids. B, association of ANX21 with the detergent-insoluble fraction. A crude trophozoite homogenate prepared in the presence of 4 mm free Ca2+either without detergent (lanes 1–2) or after subsequent extraction with Triton X-100 (lanes 3–4) was fractionated into supernatant (s) and pellet (p) fractions and probed as above. Lane 5 shows EGTA extract of pellet fromlane 4. Each lane contained 30 μg of protein. For further details, see “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the association of ANX21 with negatively charged phospholipids, we extracted trophozoite homogenate with EGTA and incubated the soluble supernatant with multilamellar liposomes prepared from brain extract. Fig. 4 A shows that the extracted ANX21, just like ANX19 (11Bauer B. Engelbrecht S. Bakker-Grunwald T. Scholze H. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 147-153PubMed Google Scholar) and ANX 20 (data not shown), ended up in the pellet fraction in the presence of excess Ca2+ (lane 4) but remained in the supernatant in its absence (lane 1). This effect was strictly dependent on the presence of the liposomes (lanes 5–6). These data confirm that ANX21 behaves as a classical annexin in associating with negatively charged phospholipids in a Ca2+-dependent way. In a complementary set of experiments, we homogenized the cells in the presence of free Ca2+. As expected, in the presence of endogenous phospholipids, ANX21 remained in the insoluble fraction (lane 2 of Fig. 4 B). Likewise, when the pellet fraction was subsequently extracted with detergent, ANX21 remained in the pellet fraction (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). However, when this pellet was treated with an 1 mm excess of EGTA, ANX21 went into solution (lane 5, Fig. 4 B). As any phospholipid membranes that had been precipitated from the homogenate should be dissolved into floating micellar structures by the detergent, we interpret these data to mean that ANX21, apart from binding to phospholipids, also associates with detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal elements in the presence of Ca2+. An association with the detergent-extracted cytoskeletal fraction has also been reported (17Clark J.T. Holberton D.V. Parasitol. Res. 1988; 74: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) for ANX19 and ANX20 (at that time denoted as α-giardins). Combining the model of Fig. 2 with the fractionation behavior documented in Fig.4, we speculate that the G. lamblia-specific motifs of ANX19–21 are responsible for interaction (directly or indirectly) with detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal elements. In fixed and permeabilized trophozoites, ANX21 was exclusively localized in the eight flagella (and in those cells where it was observable, in the median body) (Fig. 5 A). Control incubations with antisera against tubulin (Fig. 5 B) and a proteasome subunit (not shown) indicated that this restricted distribution was not due to a lack of permeability of the cells. In agreement with these data, Western blot analysis of isolated flagella revealed cross-reaction with both the tubulin and ANX21 antibodies (Fig. 5 C) but not with anti-ANX19 antibodies (data not shown). Together with our observation that ANX21 interacts with both phospholipids and the detergent-insoluble cytoskeletal fraction in a Ca2+-dependent way, we interpret the flagellar localization to mean that ANX21 may play a Ca2+-regulated structural role in trophozoite motility. Specifically, our data would fit in with a model in which binding of Ca2+ to the convex surface of ANX21, apart from increasing the affinity of this surface to the flagellar membrane, induces a conformational change at the concave surface that enables the latter to interact with a cytoskeletal element of the axoneme (possibly an adapter protein). In the literature, there are precedents for both Ca2+-dependent binding of annexins to cytoskeletal proteins and for the localization of annexins in flagella or cilia. Thus, many vertebrate annexins bind F-actin in a Ca2+-dependent way (24Khanna N.C. Helwig E.D. Ikebuchi N.W. Fitzpatrick S. Bajwa R. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4852-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). For ANX2, this binding has been shown to depend upon the nine C-terminal amino acid residues that, just like the motifs specifically shared by the annexins of G. lamblia (Fig. 2), are predicted to be located on the concave surface of the protein (25Filipenko N.R. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5310-5315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). (The F-actin-binding ANX2 residues are not conserved in the G. lamblia annexins; data not shown). As to axonemal localization, the ciliated cells of lung epithelium specifically contain ANX1 in their cilia (26Mayran N. Traverso V. Maroux S. Massey-Harroche D. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: 863-871PubMed Google Scholar), and both ANX1 and ANX2 have been found to move to the sperm flagellum during ram sperm maturation (27Feinberg J.M. Rainteau D.P. Kaetzel M.A. Dacheux J.L. Dedman J.R. Weinman S.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). An interesting variant on the theme of association of Ca2+-regulated proteins with axonemes is provided by the paraflagellar rod complex from Trypanosoma brucei, which instead of annexins, contains EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins (28Wu Y. Haghighat N.G. Ruben L. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 187-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 29Ridgley E. Webster P. Patton C. Ruben L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 109: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). As mentioned above, we hypothesize that for Ca2+-dependent interaction of ANX21 with theG. lamblia axoneme the four motifs conserved in the last domains of giardial annexins (Fig. 1) may be important; consequently, our future experiments will be directed at identifying the corresponding protein binding partner(s) of these annexins.

This property has led to an exploration of the potential utility of ribozymes for the targeted inactivation of cellular and viral RNAs. Indeed, there is an urgent need for the development of novel and effective measures to combat existing and emerging viral pathogens. Several groups (4Alvarez-Salas L.M. Cullinan A.E. Siwkowski A.

Virol. 1999; 73: 5381-5387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have described attempts to achieve ribozyme inhibition of viral replication, but success has been limited. In some cases, there remains uncertainty as to whether viral inhibition results from ribozyme cleavage of the targeted RNA, because other mechanisms of inhibition, such as antisense effects and interference with the expression of cellular genes that support viral replication, have not always been ruled out. Our laboratory has recently addressed two major issues that may limit RNA inactivation by engineered ribozymes: (i) intracellular catalysis (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 9Vitiello D. Pecchia D. Burke J.M. RNA. 2000; 6: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) and (ii) target site accessibility (13Yu Q. Pecchia D.B. Kingsley S.L. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Yu Q. Burke J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). Results have shown that hairpin ribozymes can catalyze efficient cleavage of RNA substrates within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells both in cis (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and in trans (9Vitiello D. Pecchia D. Burke J.M. RNA. 2000; 6: 628-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These studies were undertaken systematically to monitor intracellular ribozyme-mediated RNA cleavage and were accompanied by controls that included inactive ribozyme, uncleavable substrates, and active ribozymes with irrelevant substrate specificity. We concluded that the intracellular selectivity and biochemical requirements of the hairpin ribozyme appear to parallel closely those that have been elucidated in the test tube. The same conclusion has recently been shown to be true for cleavage and ligation of the hairpin ribozyme in yeast (10Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar, 11Yadava R.S. Choi A.J. Lebruska L.L. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 12Donahue C.P. Yadava R.S. Nesbitt S.M. Fedor M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 295: 693-707Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To examine the issue of target site specificity, we conducted a comprehensive survey of ribozyme cleavage sites within a highly structured RNA, the 26 S subgenomic RNA of Sindbis virus, using a combinatorial method in which cleavage sites were mapped using a library of hairpin ribozymes containing all possible substrate specificities (13Yu Q. Pecchia D.B. Kingsley S.L. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This method was compared with the standard method of site selection, the identification of sites that most closely fit the substrate consensus sequence, established by in vitro studies employing oligoribonucleotide substrates (14Yu Q. Burke J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 74: 161-169PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly, nearly all sites that were cleaved most effectively by the ribozyme library showed marked deviation from the established consensus sequence. Comparative in vitro cleavage analysis using synthetic ribozymes directed to both consensus and non-consensus sites showed that the “activity-selected” non-consensus ribozymes cleaved structured target RNA molecules slowly but much more effectively than did ribozymes directed to consensus or “sequence-selected” sites. However, the latter class was significantly more effective in cleaving oligoribonucleotide substrates. Together, these results support a model in which target site accessibility is essential for cleavage, whereas correspondence to the preferred substrate sequence is of secondary importance (13Yu Q. Pecchia D.B. Kingsley S.L. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Sindbis virus is a member of the Alphavirus genus, a group of arthropod-borne enveloped viruses that cause acute encephalitis and arthritis in humans and animals (15Strauss J.H. Strauss E.G. Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 58: 491-562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 11,703-nucleotide positive strand RNA genome of Sindbis virus strain S.A.A.R.86 (16Simpson D.A. Davis N.L. Lin S.C. Russell D. Johnston R.E. Virology. 1996; 222: 464-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is capped, polyadenylated, and infectious. Translation of the 49 S genomic RNA is followed by proteolytic processing, generating proteins nsP1–nsP4, which are responsible for cytoplasmic RNA synthesis. Production of positive and negative strand genomic RNA begins during the first 3 h of infection and reaches a plateau by 24 h. Large quantities of a 26 S subgenomic RNA are generated, leading to the recruitment of essentially all of the ribosomes of the host cell for synthesis of the viral structural proteins. Infectious virions are released from the cell membrane at a prodigious rate (2000 plaque-forming units/h). Infection is characterized by dramatic cytopathology and induced apoptosis within 36 h after infection. Because of its rapid replication, large burst size, and highly structured RNA, Sindbis virus represents a highly challenging system in which to develop and test antiviral ribozymes. Here, we report that the expression of hairpin ribozymes within clonal cell lines can effectively and selectively inhibit the replication of Sindbis virus. DNA and RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer and deprotected using standard methods (17Sproat B. Colonna F. Mullah B. Tsou D. Andrus A. Hample A. Vinayak R. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1995; 14: 255-273Crossref Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Ribozymes were transcribed from linearized plasmid templates using T7 RNA polymerase, yielding a 550-nucleotide ribozyme transcript with the 3′ segment corresponding closely to the transcript obtained by pol III transcription from the U6 promoterin vivo. DNA and RNA molecules were purified as described previously (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Butcher S.E.

BHK-21 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes, transfected with the indicated plasmids, trypsinized, and plated onto coverslips in 100-mm dishes 24 h after the start of transfection; they were fixed in 4% (w/v) formaldehyde, 5% (v/v) acetic acid, 0.9% (w/v) NaCl 24 h later. Coverslips were stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C until ready for hybridization. Hybridization reactions were performed as follows. Cells were washed two times for 5 min in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),1 two times for 5 min in 100 mm glycine in 1× PBS, 15 min in 0.3% Triton X-100, and two times in 1× PBS. Cells were permeabilized by treatment with 1 ng of proteinase K in Tris/EDTA, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for 5 min. Cells were then post-fixed in 4% formaldehyde, 1× PBS for 5 min at 4 °C, washed two times in 1× PBS and two times for 5 min in 100 mm triethanolamine, pH 8.0, and 0.25% acetic anhydride at 37 °C. The cells were prehybridized for 4 h in 50% formamide, 4× SSC at 37 °C and then hybridized overnight at 42 °C in 40% formamide, 4× SSC, 10% dextran sulfate, 1× Denhardt's solution, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml heat-denatured salmon sperm DNA, 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and heat-denatured in vitro transcribed RNA probes labeled with fluorescein 12-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After hybridization cells were washed at 37 °C two times for 15 min in 2× SSC and two times for 15 min in 1× SSC. The cells were treated with 20 μg/ml RNase A in 500 mm NaCl in Tris/EDTA, pH 8.0, for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed two times for 15 min in 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 52 °C. Coverslips were mounted onto slides in nine parts glycerol and one part 1× PBS with 5 ng/μl 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). In vitro cleavage assays using ribozymes extracted from transiently transfected cells were performed as follows. Total cellular RNA (10 μg) from cells transfected with vectors expressing active and inactive ribozymes (∼0.16 nm) were preincubated at 90 °C with 5′-radiolabeled substrate (∼1.5 nm) for 2 min in 50 mm Tris·HCl (pH 8.0) and 12 mmMgCl2 and then incubated at 37 °C under conditions of substrate excess. Aliquots for each time point (10 μl) were removed, quenched with an equal volume of formamide loading buffer containing 25 mm EDTA, denatured at 90 °C for 2 min, resolved by electrophoresis, and quantitated as described elsewhere (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The intracellular half-lives of ribozyme RNAs and native U6 RNAs were assayed by arresting cellular transcription with 10 μg/ml actinomycin D (Sigma) administered to cell cultures 24 h after transfection (24Noonberg S.B. Scott G.K. Garovoy M.R. Benz C.C. Hunt C.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2830-2836Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 h after transcription arrest. Primer extension assays were performed to quantitate ribozyme RNA and U6 snRNA levels. Results were fit to an exponential decay equation (Y = Y0 + A−t/τ, where Y0 + A is the starting point, Y0 is the end point, t is time, and τ is the decay constant) using Microcal/Origin software. BHK-21 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection and cultured in minimal essential medium (D-MEM, Sigma) containing 5% heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) fetal bovine serum, 10% tryptose phosphate, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (10,000 units/ml), and streptomycin (10 mg/ml). Co-transfections were done using 2 μg of total circular plasmid DNA with a 5:1 molar excess of the plasmid encoding ribozymes over the plasmid expressing neomycin resistance (pSV2neo, CLONTECH) with LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) as described (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Seventy-two hours after the start of transfection, cells were passaged 1:10 into a medium containing 1 mg/ml of geneticin for selection of clonal cell lines. Medium was changed every 48 h during the first week of selection. Drug selection proceeded for approximately 2 weeks; individual drug-resistant colonies were isolated, and ribozyme expression was analyzed by primer extension. BHK-21 cells were transfected with in vitrotranscripts of a Sindbis virus S.A.A.R.86 genomic cDNA clone encoding green fluorescent protein (ps73; a kind gift from R. E. Johnston, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC) for the production of viral stocks. To generate infectious, capped RNA, 2 μg of XbaI-linearized ps73 was transcribed using phage SP6 RNA polymerase (mMESSAGE MACHINE Kit, Ambion). BHK-21 cells grown to 60% confluency in 60-mm plates were transfected with 2 μg of the viral RNA and 4 μl Lipofectin reagent in serum-free medium (Optimem, Invitrogen) following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. Culture supernatants were then collected, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and tested for the presence of infectious viral particles through plaque assays on BHK-21 cells (25Mahy B.W.J. Kangro H.O. Virology Methods Manual. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1996: 35-39Google Scholar, 26Heidner H.W. McKnight K.L. Davis N.L. Johnston R.E. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2683-2692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lines expressing ribozymes were infected with the Sindbis-GFP virus at an m.o.i. of 0.05 plaque-forming units/cell for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was replaced with fresh minimal essential medium, and cells were incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots of the medium were removed at 24, 30, 36, and 48 h post-infection. BHK-21 cells grown in 60-mm dishes (80–90% confluency) were employed for monitoring viral titer upon infection with each virus-containing aliquot. Viruses were allowed to adsorb to cells for 1 h at 37 °C. The inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with 0.5% agarose in complete medium and further incubated for 36 h at 37 °C. The agarose overlay was removed, and cells were stained with 1% crystal violet solution. Plates were scored for the total number of plaques formed to calculate plaque-forming units/ml. Cells were infected with Sindbis-GFP virus as described above at an m.o.i. of 0.3 and analyzed for GFP expression 24 h after infection. Monolayers of cells were harvested by trypsinization, fixed with formalin, and scored by single channel fluorescence in a flow cytometer (Coulter EPICS Elite) to examine GFP emission (488 nm excitation, and 530 ± 30 nm emission). Ten thousand cells were analyzed per sample. Subsequent analysis of flow cytometry data was performed using WinList 3D curve-fitting software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME). Resolution of the GFP positive peaks of the cell population was determined using the negative subtraction option in the software. This analysis technique automatically subtracts the negative control data from the actual sample data, leaving the positive fraction for statistical analysis. This technique is most often used when attempting to discern mixed peaks. Total intracellular RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent and quantified by UV spectroscopy as described (8Seyhan A.A. Amaral J. Burke J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 3494-3504Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two 5′-32P-labeled primers were used simultaneously in primer extension reactions: a ribozyme-specific primer that is complementary to the loop B domain (5′-CCAGGTAATGTACGATCTC-3′) and yields an 88-nucleotide long extension product from the ribozyme transcript driven by the U6 promoter; and a U6 snRNA-specific primer that is complementary to native U6 snRNA (5′-GGCCATGCTAATCTTCTCTG-3′) and generates a 61-nucleotide extension product, which was used as an internal control. Purified cellular RNA (5 μg) was first denatured in the presence of 5′-32P-labeled DNA primers (4 × 105 dpm, 50 fmol) at 80 °C for 10 min in 5 μl of hybridization buffer (60 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris·HCl pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol) and then slowly cooled to 30 °C to permit annealing. Annealed samples (2 μl) were added to 3 μl of primer extension buffer (0.375 mm dNTPs, 1× hybridization buffer). Reverse transcription was initiated by adding MgCl2 to 4 mm and 5 units of avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase followed by a 30-min incubation at 47 °C. Reactions were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of formamide loading buffer containing 10 mm EDTA, denatured at 80 °C for 2 min, and then separated by electrophoresis through an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel. Gels were quantified using a Bio-Rad GS-525 molecular imager and Molecular Analyst 2.1 software. Quantitation of ribozyme RNA levels was performed using native U6 snRNA as a reference (500,000 copies per cell) (27Sauterer R.A. Feeney R.J. Zieve G.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 344-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The ribozyme expression constructs employ a U6 snRNA expression strategy (21Good P.D. Krikos A.J., Li, S.X. Bertrand E. Lee N.S. Giver L. Ellington A. Zaia J.A. Rossi J.J. Engelke D.R. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and lead to the synthesis of RNA transcripts containing 5′- and 3′-terminal flanking sequences (Fig.1) that are intended to (i) promote the initiation and termination of discrete ribozyme-containing transcripts, (ii) isolate the ribozyme within a discrete RNA folding domain, and (iii) stabilize the transcript from exonucleolytic degradation. The effects of these additional sequences on the catalytic activity of the ribozyme were determined by kinetic analysis under single turnover conditions in vitro. The observed cleavage rate (0.034 min−1) is within a factor of 3 of that observed under the same conditions for a ribozyme transcript that lacks flanking sequences. Importantly, the extent of cleavage is high (90% cleavage after 80 min; data not shown). Together, the high extent of cleavage and the modest decline in cleavage rate induced by the flanking sequences were judged to be satisfactory for proceeding with cellular expression and viral inhibition assays. BHK-21 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ribozymes, and both transiently transfected populations and stably transfected clonal cell lines were derived. To measure the accumulation of ribozyme-containing transcripts, total cellular RNA was harvested as a function of time after transfection, and a quantitative primer extension assay was employed using two 32P-labeled primers, one specific for the hairpin ribozyme and the other for U6 snRNA. Ribozyme transcripts accumulated to relatively high levels (5 × 104/cell) in transiently transfected cells. Stable cell lines showed significantly lower accumulation (2 × 103/cell), consistent with a lower copy number. Detectable levels of transcript could be identified as early as 5 h after transfection, and peak levels of ribozyme accumulation were observed at 24–30 h in transient populations (data not shown). In situ hybridization of transiently transfected cells revealed predominant nuclear localization of the ribozyme transcripts (Fig. 2) consistent with published results (21Good P.D. Krikos A.J., Li, S.X. Bertrand E. Lee N.S. Giver L. Ellington A. Zaia J.A. Rossi J.J. Engelke D.R. Gene Ther. 1997; 4: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 22Bertrand E. Castanotto D. Zhou C. Carbonnelle C. Lee N.S. Good P. Chatterjee S. Grange T. Pictet R. Kohn D. Engelke D. Rossi J.J. RNA. 1997; 3: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). However, there does appear to be a fluorescent signal above background in the cytoplasm of cells probed with antisense ribozyme probe. No hybridization signal was observed when stable cell lines were used, consistent with the decreased steady state accumulation of ribozyme transcripts in the cell lines. The stability of ribozyme transcripts and native U6 snRNA were measured by primer extension experiments following transcriptional arrest of both transiently and stably transfected clonal cells by actinomycin D (Fig. 3). The half-life of the ribozyme transcript (23 min) was much shorter than that of U6 snRNA (20 h) (27Sauterer R.A. Feeney R.J. Zieve G.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 176: 344-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,28Terns M. Dahlberg J. Lund E. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The activity of ribozymes expressed within BHK-21 cells was confirmed by assaying cleavage activity in extracts of total cellular RNA. Cleavage reactions were carried out using 32P end-labeled substrate (1.5 nm) in molar excess over expressed ribozymes (0.16 nm). RNA extracted from cells expressing the active ribozyme cleaved the substrate, whereas no cleavage was observed when RNA was prepared from untransfected cells or cells that express the mutationally inactivated ribozyme (Fig.4). These results demonstrate that (i) cellular transcripts of the active ribozyme have the desired trans-cleavage activity and specificity, (ii) the mutations eliminate cleavage activity in these transcripts, (iii) the ribozyme can find its substrate within the highly complex population of cellular RNA, and (iv) no endogenous cellular RNA can cleave the Sindbis 8242 target. Ribozyme inhibition of viral replication was examined by viral challenge of stable cell lines expressing hairpin ribozymes. The two assays of Sindbis virus replication employed to monitor virus production by ribozyme-expressing cell lines were plaque formation and GFP expression. These assays were conducted in parallel. BHK-21 cells and cells expressing the active antiviral ribozyme, inactive antiviral ribozyme, and active ribozyme with an altered (irrelevant) target specificity were infected with recombinant Sindbis virus at an m.o.i. of 0.05. Aliquots of the supernatant were removed from cultures at time points from 24 to 48 h after infection and then assayed for plaque formation by plating on BHK-21 cells. Cells were exposed to infectious virus in duplicate, using two culture dishes for each time point of each assay. Results show nearly confluent formation of plaques when viruses obtained from a 36-h infection of control BHK-21 cells were plated (Fig. 5, panel IC). In contrast, cells expressing the active antiviral ribozyme generated far fewer infectious virions (Fig. 5, panel A). The elimination of catalytic activity via mutations in the catalytic core of the ribozyme greatly diminished the antiviral activity (Fig. 5, panel I). The active ribozyme with an altered target specificity showed some inhibition of viral replication (Fig. 5, panel M), although the extent of inhibition was markedly less than that for cells expressing the active antiviral ribozyme. The time course shows that these trends hold for all time points after the emergence of infectious viral particles (Fig. 5). Separate aliquots of supernatants from infected cell lines were used to infect BHK-21 cells at an m.o.i. of 0.3. Cells were fixed for analysis by flow cytometry 24 h after the start of infection (Fig.6). In this assay, GFP synthesis serves as a surrogate reporter for viral gene expression. At all time points after infection, GFP expression from viruses grown in cells expressing the active antiviral ribozyme was strongly inhibited, whereas expression from viruses grown in control cells not expressing ribozyme was high. Expression of the catalytically inactive ribozyme resulted in a modest decrease in GFP expression, but the extent of inhibition was significantly less than that observed for the active antiviral ribozyme. Expression of the active ribozyme with altered target specificity resulted in little diminution of GFP expression. Our results strongly support a model in which the expression of hairpin ribozymes directed against a target site in Sindbis virus genomic and subgenomic RNA molecules inhibits viral replication through a targeted RNA cleavage mechanism. The expression of control ribozymes that lack catalytic activity or have irrelevant target specificities results in little inhibitory activity, supporting the conclusion that antisense and nonspecific mechanisms of viral inhibition are significantly less important than targeted RNA cleavage. The agreement of data sets obtained from two independent and quantitative methods for monitoring viral replication and gene expression provides additional confidence in these results. Although these results are consistent with cleavage of the targeted site (nucleotide position 8242) within viral RNA molecules, they do not themselves prove that viral inhibition results from cleavage of the intended site. For example, inhibition by ribozyme 8242 could result from cleavage of an unintended site within the viral RNA or from cleavage of a mRNA encoding a host gene product necessary for viral replication. Conclusions regarding the site of action can come only from mutational analysis of the target site. These studies are now underway in our laboratory. The observed level of antiviral activity is less than profound. However, it should be noted that there are three factors that may have significantly limited the antiviral activity of the ribozyme used in this work. First, the clonal cell lines employed in our viral inhibition experiments express ribozymes at low steady state levels. Second, Sindbis virus replicates rapidly and produces progeny viruses at a very high rate (∼2000 viruses/cell/h). Up to 200,000 copies of the subgenomic RNA can be made in a single cell (29Wengler G. Schlesinger R.W. The Togaviruses. Academic Press, New York1980: 459Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, viral replication, once established in a cell, would be expected to overwhelm the ribozymes. Third, the ribozymes show predominant (but not exclusive) nuclear localization, whereas viral replication occurs within the cytoplasm. It should be noted that the sensitivity of the in situhybridization experiments was insufficient to observe ribozymes expressed in the stable cell lines used for the viral challenge experiments. Therefore, it is possible that the subcellular distribution of ribozymes expressed at low levels might be different from that observed when ribozymes are expressed at higher levels. Specifically, the high expression levels in transiently transfected cells may saturate a nuclear export system. In addition, it is possible that other target sites may be identified that can be cleaved with higher efficiency. In this regard, it should be noted that target sites have been identified that can be cleaved with higher efficiency than the 8242 site used in the present study (13Yu Q. Pecchia D.B. Kingsley S.L. Heckman J.E. Burke J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23524-23533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the elucidation of the structural basis for the strong guanosine requirement at the cleavage site may pave the way for the development of hairpin ribozymes that target previously inaccessible sequences (30Pinard R. Lambert D. Walter N.G. Heckman J.E. Major F. Burke J.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16035-16039Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Experimental tools to deal with each of these limitations to antiviral activity appear to be at hand. It is likely that significantly higher levels of antiviral activity can be achieved by engineering ribozyme expression constructs that are transcribed more efficiently, are preferentially transported to and retained within the cytoplasm, and have a greater intracellular half-life. Therefore, we believe that our results are highly encouraging for the development of ribozymes as agents for the selective inactivation of targeted viral and cellular RNA molecules and that experimental gene therapy protocols to prevent or attenuate viral infections are a realistic goal in the foreseeable future.
