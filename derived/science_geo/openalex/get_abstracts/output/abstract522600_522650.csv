Methods Grade 10 and 11 high school students were randomly selected from nine randomly selected districts of Beijing. The students underwent non-cylcoplegic auto-refractometry and an interview. Results Out of 4798 eligible students, 4677 (93.4%) students (mean age:16.9±0.7years;range:16–18 years) participated. Mean refractive error of right eyes and left eyes was −2.78±2.29 diopters and −2.59±2.50 diopters, respectively. Prevalence of myopia (defined as ≤ −1.00 diopters in the worse eye) was 80.7% (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 79.6–81.8%). Out of 3773 students with myopia, 1525 (40.4%) wore glasses daily. In multiple logistic regression analysis, a higher prevalence of myopia was associated with female sex (odds ratio (OR) = 1.31;95%CI:1.11–1.55), Han ethnicity (OR = 1.64;95%CI:1.28–2.11), attending key schools (OR = 1.48;95%CI:1.24,1.77), higher family income (OR = 1.37;95%CI:1.09–1.71), longer time spent for near work (OR = 1.43;95%CI:1.06–1.93), shorter near work distance (OR = 1.87;95%CI:1.55–2.26), lower frequency of active rest during studying (OR = 1.40;95%CI:1.16–1.70), and parental myopia (OR = 2.28;95%CI:1.80–2.87). The interaction between distance from near work and time spent for near work was statistically (P = 0.03) significant. In multiple logistic regression analysis, higher prevalence of high myopia (≤-6.0 diopters) was associated with studying in key schools (OR = 1.38;95%CI:1.05,1.81), lower frequency of active rest during studying (OR = 1.40;95%CI:1.09,1.79), and a higher number of myopic parents (OR = 2.66;95%CI:2.08,3.40). Conclusions A prevalence of about 80% for myopia and a prevalence of about 10% for high myopia in students aged 16 to 18 years and attending classes of grade 10 and 11 in a Chinese metropolitan region is another example of the high prevalence of moderate and high myopia in metropolitan areas of China. With this young myopic generation getting older, myopia as cause for visual impairment and blindness may further increase in importance. Future studies may address whether active rests during studying with looking into the distance are preventive against myopia development or progression."

The package extends previously described software used for otolith shape analysis by allowing the user to automatically extract closed contour outlines from a large number of images, perform smoothing to eliminate pixel noise, choose from conducting either a Fourier or Wavelet transform to the outlines and visualize the mean shape. The output of the package are independent Fourier or Wavelet coefficients which can be directly imported into a wide range of statistical packages in R. The package might prove useful in studies of any two dimensional objects."
https://openalex.org/W2000110609,"Introduction Proper imaging allows practitioners to evaluate an asymptomatic tempormandibular joint (TMJ) for potential degenerative changes prior to surgical and orthodontic treatment. The recently developed cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) allows measurement of TMJ bony structures with high accuracy. A study was undertaken to determine the morphology, and its variations, of the mandibular condyle and glenoid fossa among Malay and Chinese Malaysians. Methods CBCT was used to assess 200 joints in 100 subjects (mean age, 30.5 years). i-CAT CBCT software and The Mimics 16.0 software were employed to measure the volume, metrical size, position of each condyle sample and the thickness of the roof of the glenoid fossa (RGF). Results No significant gender differences were noted in thickness of the RGF and condylar length; however condylar volume, width, height and the joint spaces were significantly greater among males. With regards to comparison of both TMJs, the means of condylar volume, width and length of the right TMJ were significantly higher, while the means of the left condylar height and thickness of RGF were higher. When comparing the condylar measurements and the thickness of RGF between the two ethnic groups, we found no significant difference for all measurements with exception of condylar height, which is higher among Chinese. Conclusion The similarity in measurements for Malays and Chinese may be due to their common origin. This information can be clinically useful in establishing the diagnostic criteria for condylar volume, metrical size, and position in the Malaysian East Asians population."
https://openalex.org/W2101258119,"The nonlinearity of dynamics in systems biology makes it hard to infer them from experimental data. Simple linear models are computationally efficient, but cannot incorporate these important nonlinearities. An adaptive method based on the S-system formalism, which is a sensible representation of nonlinear mass-action kinetics typically found in cellular dynamics, maintains the efficiency of linear regression. We combine this approach with adaptive model selection to obtain efficient and parsimonious representations of cellular dynamics. The approach is tested by inferring the dynamics of yeast glycolysis from simulated data. With little computing time, it produces dynamical models with high predictive power and with structural complexity adapted to the difficulty of the inference problem."
https://openalex.org/W2006529015,"Our study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Tang Du Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University and complied strictly with national ethical guidelines. Preeclampsia (PE) is a specific clinical disorder characterized by gestational hypertension and proteinuria and is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal mortality worldwide. The miR-519d-3p is upregulated in the maternal plasma of patients with PE which indicates a possible association between this microRNA and the pathogenesis of PE. No studies to date have addressed the effect of miR-519d-3p on the invasion and migration of trophoblast cells. In our study, we found that miR-519d-3p expression was elevated in placental samples from patients with PE. In vitro, overexpression of miR-519d-3p significantly inhibited trophoblast cell migration and invasion, whereas transfection of a miR-519d-3p inhibitor enhanced trophoblast cell migration and invasion. Luciferase assays confirmed that matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is a direct target of miR-519d-3p. Quantitative real-time PCR and western blot assays showed that overexpression of miR-519d-3p downregulated MMP-2 mRNA and protein expression. Knockdown of MMP-2 using a siRNA attenuated the increased trophoblast migration and invasion promoted by the miR-519d-3p inhibitor. In placentas from patients with PE or normal pregnancies, a negative correlation between the expression of MMP-2 and miR-519d-3p was observed using the Pearson correlation and linear regression analysis. Our present findings suggest that upregulation of miR-519d-3p may contribute to the development of PE by inhibiting trophoblast cell migration and invasion via targeting MMP-2; miR-519d-3p may represent a potential predictive and therapeutic target for PE."
https://openalex.org/W2010362844,"Despite long-standing interest in elevational-diversity gradients, little is known about the processes that cause changes in the compositional variation of communities (β-diversity) across elevations. Recent studies have suggested that β-diversity gradients are driven by variation in species pools, rather than by variation in the strength of local community assembly mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, or local biotic interactions. However, tests of this hypothesis have been limited to very small spatial scales that limit inferences about how the relative importance of assembly mechanisms may change across spatial scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that scale-dependent community assembly mechanisms shape biogeographic β-diversity gradients using one of the most well-characterized elevational gradients of tropical plant diversity. Using an extensive dataset on woody plant distributions along a 4,000-m elevational gradient in the Bolivian Andes, we compared observed patterns of β-diversity to null-model expectations. β-deviations (standardized differences from null values) were used to measure the relative effects of local community assembly mechanisms after removing sampling effects caused by variation in species pools. To test for scale-dependency, we compared elevational gradients at two contrasting spatial scales that differed in the size of local assemblages and regions by at least an order of magnitude. Elevational gradients in β-diversity persisted after accounting for regional variation in species pools. Moreover, the elevational gradient in β-deviations changed with spatial scale. At small scales, local assembly mechanisms were detectable, but variation in species pools accounted for most of the elevational gradient in β-diversity. At large spatial scales, in contrast, local assembly mechanisms were a dominant force driving changes in β-diversity. In contrast to the hypothesis that variation in species pools alone drives β-diversity gradients, we show that local community assembly mechanisms contribute strongly to systematic changes in β-diversity across elevations. We conclude that scale-dependent variation in community assembly mechanisms underlies these iconic gradients in global biodiversity."
https://openalex.org/W2027118294,"Cultured mammalian cells exhibit elevated glycolysis flux and high lactate production. In the industrial bioprocesses for biotherapeutic protein production, glucose is supplemented to the culture medium to sustain continued cell growth resulting in the accumulation of lactate to high levels. In such fed-batch cultures, sometimes a metabolic shift from a state of high glycolysis flux and high lactate production to a state of low glycolysis flux and low lactate production or even lactate consumption is observed. While in other cases with very similar culture conditions, the same cell line and medium, cells continue to produce lactate. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption has been correlated to the productivity of the process. Cultures that exhibited the metabolic shift to lactate consumption had higher titers than those which didn’t. However, the cues that trigger the metabolic shift to lactate consumption state (or low lactate production state) are yet to be identified. Metabolic control of cells is tightly linked to growth control through signaling pathways such as the AKT pathway. We have previously shown that the glycolysis of proliferating cells can exhibit bistability with well-segregated high flux and low flux states. Low lactate production (or lactate consumption) is possible only at a low glycolysis flux state. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to demonstrate that lactate inhibition together with AKT regulation on glycolysis enzymes can profoundly influence the bistable behavior, resulting in a complex steady-state topology. The transition from the high flux state to the low flux state can only occur in certain regions of the steady state topology, and therefore the metabolic fate of the cells depends on their metabolic trajectory encountering the region that allows such a metabolic state switch. Insights from such switch behavior present us with new means to control the metabolism of mammalian cells in fed-batch cultures."
https://openalex.org/W1975394549,"Calcium and calcium channels are closely related to the estrogen-induced nongenomic effect of endometrial carcinoma, but the specific role of calcium channels is unknown. This study aimed to explore the expression and the biologic effect of the l-type calcium channel in endometrial carcinoma cells and to clarify the molecular mechanism of the relationship between L-type calcium channels and estrogen. The immunohistochemical results showed that Ca2+ channel subunit α 1D (Cav1.3) expression was high in atypical hyperplasia (1.90 ± 0.35) and endometrial carcinoma tissues (2.05 ± 0.82) but weak (0.80 ± 0.15) in benign endometrial tissues (P < 0.05). Treatment with 17b-estradiol rapidly increased Cav1.3 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner, and 100 nM cell-impermeable β-estradiol-6-(O-carboxymethyl) oxime:bovine serum albumin also promoted Cav1.3 expression. Transfection with small interfering RNA against G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) suppressed estrogen-induced up-regulation of Cav1.3 compared with control cells and markedly reduced the estrogen-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and CREB. Knocking down the Cav1.3 significantly suppressed estrogen-stimulated Ca2+ influx, cell proliferation, and migration in endometrial cancer cells. Taken together, Cav1.3 was overexpressed in atypical hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma, and the estrogen-induced phosphorylation of downstream molecular ERK1/2 and CREB is the result of activation of the GPER pathway. L-type channel Cav1.3 is required for estrogen-stimulated Ca2+ influx and contributes broadly to the development of endometrial cancer. The Cav1.3 channel may be a new target for endometrial carcinoma treatment.—Hao, J., Bao, X., Jin, B., Wang, X., Mao, Z., Li, X., Wei, L., Shen, D., Wang, J.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2009470626,"We investigated the effects of 4-17 month supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (Smartfish drink; Smartfish AS, Oslo, Norway) in 12 patients with minor cognitive impairment (MCI) [minimental state examination (MMSE) ≥19], 2 patients with pre-MCI (normal MMSE), and 7 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) (MMSE <19). We measured the phagocytosis of amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ) by flow cytometry and microscopy, the transcription of inflammatory genes by RT-PCR, the production of resolvin D1 (RvD1) by enzyme immunoassay, and the cognitive status by MMSE. In patients with MCI and pre-MCI, phagocytosis of Aβ by monocytes increased from 530 to 1306 mean fluorescence intensity units (P = 0.016). The increase in patients with AD was not significant (N.S.). The lipidic mediator RvD1, which stimulates Aβ phagocytosis in vitro, increased in macrophages in 80% of patients with MCI and pre-MCI (mean increase 9.95 pg/ml) (N.S.). Transcription of inflammatory genes' mRNAs was increased in a subgroup of patients with low transcription at baseline, whereas it was not significantly changed in patients with high transcription at baseline. The mean MMSE score of patients with MCI and pre-MCI was 25.9 at baseline and 25.7 after 4-17 months (N.S.). Our study is the first to show significant immune and biochemical effects of ω-3 fatty acids with antioxidants in patients with MCI. Cognitive benefits of ω-3 supplementation in patients with MCI should be tested in a clinical trial."
https://openalex.org/W2004439029,"Obesity promotes insulin resistance associated with liver inflammation, elevated glucose production, and type 2 diabetes. Although insulin resistance is attenuated in genetic mouse models that suppress systemic inflammation, it is not clear whether local resident macrophages in liver, denoted Kupffer cells (KCs), directly contribute to this syndrome. We addressed this question by selectively silencing the expression of the master regulator of inflammation, NF-κB, in KCs in obese mice. We used glucan-encapsulated small interfering RNA particles (GeRPs) that selectively silence gene expression in macrophages in vivo. Following intravenous injections, GeRPs containing siRNA against p65 of the NF-κB complex caused loss of NF-κB p65 expression in KCs without disrupting NF-κB in hepatocytes or macrophages in other tissues. Silencing of NF-κB expression in KCs in obese mice decreased cytokine secretion and improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance without affecting hepatic lipid accumulation. Importantly, GeRPs had no detectable toxic effect. Thus, KCs are key contributors to hepatic insulin resistance in obesity and a potential therapeutic target for metabolic disease."
https://openalex.org/W2009489089,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), the enzyme responsible for sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) production, is overexpressed in many human solid tumors. However, its role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has not been described previously. ccRCC cases are usually associated with mutations in von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and subsequent normoxic stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). We previously showed that HIF-2α up-regulates SK1 expression during hypoxia in glioma cells. Therefore, we hypothesized that the stabilized HIF in ccRCC cells will be associated with increased SK1 expression. Here, we demonstrate that SK1 is overexpressed in 786-0 renal carcinoma cells lacking functional VHL, with concomitant high S1P levels that appear to be HIF-2α mediated. Moreover, examining the TCGA RNA seq database shows that SK1 expression was ∼2.7-fold higher in solid tumor tissue from ccRCC patients, and this was associated with less survival. Knockdown of SK1 in 786-0 ccRCC cells had no effect on cell proliferation. On the other hand, this knockdown resulted in an ∼3.5-fold decrease in invasion, less phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and an ∼2-fold decrease in angiogenesis. Moreover, S1P treatment of SK1 knockdown cells resulted in phosphorylation of FAK and invasion, and this was mediated by S1P receptor 2. These results suggest that higher SK1 and S1P levels in VHL-defective ccRCC could induce invasion in an autocrine manner and angiogenesis in a paracrine manner. Accordingly, targeting SK1 could reduce both the invasion and angiogenesis of ccRCC and therefore improve the survival rate of patients."

The cellular trafficking receptor sortilin 1 (Sort1) was recently identified to transport apoB100 to the lysosome for degradation in the liver and thus regulate plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Genetic variation of SORT1 was strongly associated with cardiovascular disease risk in humans. The major goal of this study is to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of insulin regulation of Sort1. Results showed that insulin induced Sort1 protein, but not mRNA, in AML12 cells. Treatment of PI3K or AKT inhibitors decreased Sort1 protein, whereas expression of constitutively active AKT induced Sort1 protein in AML12 cells. Consistently, hepatic Sort1 was down-regulated in diabetic mice, which was partially restored after the administration of the insulin sensitizer metformin. LC-MS/MS analysis further revealed that serine phosphorylation of Sort1 protein was required for insulin induction of Sort1 in a casein kinase 2-dependent manner and that inhibition of PI3K signaling or prevention of Sort1 phosphorylation accelerated proteasome-dependent Sort1 degradation. Administration of a PI3K inhibitor to mice decreased hepatic Sort1 protein and increased plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels.

https://openalex.org/W2034182822,"Background Diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM), a chronic musculoskeletal pain syndrome characterized by generalized body pain, hyperalgesia and other functional and emotional comorbidities, is a challenging process hindered by symptom heterogeneity and clinical overlap with other disorders. No objective diagnostic method exists at present. The aim of this study was to identify changes in miRNA expression profiles (miRNome) of these patients for the development of a quantitative diagnostic method of FM. In addition, knowledge of FM patient miRNomes should lead to a deeper understanding of the etiology and/or symptom severity of this complex disease. Methods Genome-wide expression profiling of miRNAs was assessed in Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) of FM patients (N=11) and population-age-matched controls (N=10) using human v16-miRbase 3D-Gene microarrays (Toray Industries, Japan). Selected miRNAs from the screen were further validated by RT-qPCR. Participating patients were long term sufferers (over 10 years) diagnosed by more than one specialist under 1990 American College of Rheumatology criteria. Results Microarray analysis of FM patient PBMCs evidenced a marked downregulation of hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p, hsa-miR145-5p and hsa-miR-21-5p (4-fold or more). All but the mildest inhibited miRNA, hsa-miR-21-5p, were validated by RT-qPCR. Globally, 20% of the miRNAs analyzed (233/1212) showed downregulation of at least 2-fold in patients. This might indicate a general de-regulation of the miRNA synthetic pathway in FM. No significant correlations between miRNA inhibition and FM cardinal symptoms could be identified. However, the patient with the lowest score for mental fatigue coincided with the mildest inhibition in four of the five miRNAs associated with the FM-group. Conclusions We propose a signature of five strikingly downregulated miRNAs (hsa-miR223-3p, hsa-miR451a, hsa-miR338-3p, hsa-miR143-3p and hsa-miR145-5p) to be used as biomarkers of FM. Validation in larger study groups is required before the results can be transferred to the clinic."
https://openalex.org/W2050002341,"L-type Ca2+ channel (VGCC) mediated Ca2+ influx in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) contributes to the functional properties of large arteries in arterial stiffening and central blood pressure regulation. How this influx relates to steady-state contractions elicited by α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation and how it is modulated by small variations in resting membrane potential (Vm) of VSMC is not clear yet. Here, we show that α1-adrenoreceptor stimulation of aortic segments of C57Bl6 mice with phenylephrine (PE) causes phasic and tonic contractions. By studying the relationship between Ca2+ mobilisation and isometric tension, it was found that the phasic contraction was due to intracellular Ca2+ release and the tonic contraction determined by Ca2+ influx. The latter component involves both Ca2+ influx via VGCC and via non-selective cation channels (NSCC). Influx via VGCC occurs only within the window voltage range of the channel. Modulation of this window Ca2+ influx by small variations of the VSMC Vm causes substantial effects on the contractile performance of aortic segments. The relative contribution of VGCC and NSCC to the contraction by α1-adrenoceptor stimulation could be manipulated by increasing intracellular Ca2+ release from non-contractile sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. Results of this study point to a complex interactions between α1-adrenoceptor-mediated VSMC contractile performance and Ca2+ release form contractile or non-contractile Ca2+ stores with concomitant Ca2+ influx. Given the importance of VGCC and their blockers in arterial stiffening and hypertension, they further point toward an additional role of NSCC (and NSCC blockers) herein."
https://openalex.org/W2008464242,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), a mycotoxin, is a potent nephrotoxin in humans and animals. Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for humans and animals, and plays a key role in antioxidant defense. To date, little is known about the effect of Se on OTA-induced nephrotoxicity. In this study, the protective effects of selenomethionine against OTA-induced nephrotoxicity were investigated using the porcine kidney 15 (PK15) cells as a model. The results showed that OTA induced nephrotoxicity in a dose-dependent manner. Se at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 μM had significant protective effects against OTA-induced nephrotoxicity. Furthermore, selenomethionine enhanced the activity and mRNA and protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), mRNA expression of GPx4, and mRNA expression of thioredoxin reductase 1 in the presence and absence of OTA. Among them, promoting effect of selenomethionine on GPx1 was maximal. Knock-down of GPx1 by using a GPx1-specific siRNA eliminated the protective effects of selenomethionine against OTA-induced nephrotoxicity. The results suggest that selenomethionine alleviates OTA-induced nephrotoxicity by improving selenoenzyme expression in PK15 cells. Therefore, selenomethionine supplementation may be an attractive strategy for protecting humans and animals from the risk of kidney damage induced by OTA."

https://openalex.org/W1974608613,"Objective Little is known about the effects of polysubstance use and cigarette smoking on brain morphometry. This study examined neocortical brain morphometric differences between abstinent polysubstance dependent and alcohol-only dependent treatment seekers (ALC) as well as light drinking controls (CON), the associations of cigarette smoking in these polysubstance users (PSU), and morphometric relationships to cognition and inhibitory control. Methods All participants completed extensive neuropsychological assessments and 4 Tesla brain magnetic resonance imaging. PSU and ALC were abstinent for one month at the time of study. Parcellated morphological data (volume, surface area, thickness) were obtained with FreeSurfer methodology for the following bilateral components: dorso-prefrontal cortex (DPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), and insula. Regional group differences were examined and structural data correlated with domains of cognition and inhibitory control. Results PSU had significantly smaller left OFC volume and surface area and trends to smaller right DPFC volume and surface area compared to CON; PSU did not differ significantly from ALC on these measures. PSU, however, had significantly thinner right ACC than ALC. Smoking PSU had significantly larger right OFC surface area than non-smoking PSU. No significant relationships between morphometry and quantity/frequency of substance use, alcohol use, or age of onset of heavy drinking were observed. PSU exhibited distinct relationships between brain structure and processing speed, cognitive efficiency, working memory and inhibitory control that were not observed in ALC or CON. Conclusion Polysubstance users have unique morphometric abnormalities and structure-function relationships when compared to individuals dependent only on alcohol and light drinking controls. Chronic cigarette smoking is associated with structural brain irregularities in polysubstance users. Further elucidation of these distinctive characteristics could help inform the development of targeted and thus potentially more effective treatments in this large but understudied population."

Immunohistochemistry showed significantly (p<0.05) elevated LPCAT1 expression in primary OSCCs compared with normal counterparts and a strong correlation between LPCAT1-positive OSCCs and tumoral size and regional lymph node metastasis. In LPCAT1 knockdown cells, cellular proliferation and invasiveness decreased significantly (p<0.05); cellular migration was inhibited compared with control cells. Down-regulation of LPCAT1 resulted in a decreased intercellular PAF concentration and PAFR expression. Conclusion LPCAT1 was overexpressed in OSCCs and correlated with cellular invasiveness and migration. LPCAT1 may contribute to tumoral growth and metastasis in oral cancer."

Cell surface-associated enolase-1 (ENO-1) enhances plasmin formation and thus participates in the regulation of pericellular proteolysis. Although increased levels of cell surface bound ENO-1 have been described in different types of cancer, the molecular mechanism responsible for ENO-1 exteriorization remains elusive. In the present study, increased ENO-1 protein levels were found in ductal breast carcinoma and on the cell surface of highly metastatic breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Elevated cell surface-associated ENO-1 expression correlated with augmented MDA-MB-231 cell migratory and invasive properties. Exposure of MDA-MB-231 cells to LPS potentiated translocation of ENO-1 to the cell surface and its release into the extracellular space in the form of exosomes.

https://openalex.org/W2087636616,"Recent findings unexpectedly revealed that human TLR4 can be directly activated by nickel ions. This activation is due to the coordination of nickel by a cluster of histidine residues on the ectodomain of human TLR4, which is absent in most other species. We aimed to elucidate the role of MD-2 in the molecular mechanism of TLR4/MD-2 activation by nickel, as nickel binding site on TLR4 is remote from MD-2, which directly binds the endotoxin as the main pathological activator of TLR4. We identified MD-2 and TLR4 mutants which abolished TLR4/MD-2 receptor activation by endotoxin but could nevertheless be significantly activated by nickel, which acts in synergy with LPS. Human TLR4/MD-2 was also activated by cobalt ions, while copper and cadmium were toxic in the tested concentration range. Activation of TLR4 by cobalt required MD-2 and was abolished by human TLR4 mutations of histidine residues at positions 456 and 458. We demonstrated that activation of TLR4 by nickel and cobalt ions can trigger both the MyD88-dependent and the –independent pathway. Based on our results we propose that predominantly hydrophobic interactions between MD-2 and TLR4 contribute to the stabilization of the TLR4/MD-2/metal ion complex in a conformation that enables activation."

This protein showed the canonical features of plant expansins. ScExlx1 showed the ability to form ""bubbles"" in cotton fibers, reduce the size of avicel particles and enhance reducing sugar liberation from cotton fibers pretreated with the protein and then treated with cellulases. ScExlx1 was able to bind cellulose, birchwood xylan and chitin and this property was not affected by different sodium chloride concentrations. A novel property of ScExlx1 is its capacity to enhance reducing sugars (N-acetyl glucosamine) liberation from pretreated chitin and further added with chitinase, which has not been reported for any expansin or expansin-like protein.

We observed higher proportions of Treg, IL-10+ and TGF-β+ CD4+ cells in CF adults (≥ 18 years old), but not children/adolescents, compared with controls. Within the CF group, high TGF-β+% was associated with chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection (p < 0.006). We observed no significant differences between control and CF groups in the proportions of Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells, and no association within the CF group of any subset with sex, CFTR genotype, or clinical exacerbation. However, high Th17% was strongly associated with poor lung function (FEV1 % predicted) (p = 0.0008), and this association was strongest when both lung function testing and blood sampling were performed within one week. Our results are consistent with reports of CF as a Th17 disease and suggest that peripheral blood Th17 levels may be a surrogate marker of lung function in CF."

https://openalex.org/W2083501031,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1 (Mapk3/1) pathway is critical for LH signal transduction during ovulation. However, the mechanisms remain incompletely understood. We hypothesized that Mapk pathway regulates ovulation through transcriptional regulation of ovulatory genes. To test this hypothesis we used immature mice superovulated with equine and human chorionic gonadotropins (eCG and hCG) and PD0325901, to inhibit hCG-induced Mapk3/1 activity. Mice received either the inhibitor PD0325901 (25 μg/g, i.p.) or vehicle at 2h before hCG stimulation. Administration of the inhibitor abolished Mapk3/1 phosphorylation in granulosa cells. While vehicle-treated mice ovulated normally, there were no ovulations in inhibitor-treated mice. First, we analyzed gene expression in granulosa cells at 0h, 1h and 4h post-hCG. There was expected hCG-driven increase in mRNA abundance of many ovulation-related genes including Ptgs2 in vehicle-treated granulosa cells, but not (P<0.05) in inhibitor-treated group. There was also reduced mRNA and protein abundance of the transcription factor, early growth response 1 (Egr1) in inhibitor-treated granulosa cells. We then used GRMO2 cell-line to test if Egr1 is recruited to promoter of Ptgs2 followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation with either Egr1 or control antibody. Enrichment of the promoter regions in immunoprecipitants of Egr1 antibody indicated that Egr1 binds to the Ptgs2 promoter. We then knocked down Egr1 expression in mouse primary granulosa cells using siRNA technology. Treatment with Egr1-siRNA inhibited Egr1 transcript accumulation, which was associated with reduced expression of Ptgs2 when compared to control-siRNA treated granulosa cells. These data demonstrate that transient inhibition of LH-stimulated MAPK3/1 activity abrogates ovulation in mice. We conclude that Mapk3/1 regulates ovulation, at least in part, through Egr1 and its target gene, Ptgs2 in granulosa cells of ovulating follicles in mice."

https://openalex.org/W2334733312,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent adult brain tumor, with virtually no cure, and with a median overall survival of 15 months from diagnosis despite of the treatment. SNARE proteins mediate membrane fusion events in cells and are essential for many cellular processes including exocytosis and neurotransmission, intracellular trafficking and cell migration. Here we show that the blockade of the SNARE protein Syntaxin 1 (Stx1) function impairs GBM cell proliferation. We show that Stx1 loss-of-function in GBM cells, through ShRNA lentiviral transduction, a Stx1 dominant negative and botulinum toxins, dramatically reduces the growth of GBM after grafting U373 cells into the brain of immune compromised mice. Interestingly, Stx1 role on GBM progression may not be restricted just to cell proliferation since the blockade of Stx1 also reduces in vitro GBM cell invasiveness suggesting a role in several processes relevant for tumor progression. Altogether, our findings indicate that the blockade of SNARE proteins may represent a novel therapeutic tool against GBM."
https://openalex.org/W1971149292,"Ischemia and reperfusion (I/R) injury is a common cause of many vascular and neuronal diseases. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has been found down-regulated or dysfunctional in several tissues upon I/R injury. To investigate the role of GAPDH in retinal I/R injury-induced neurovascular degeneration, the injured retinas of GAPDH transgenic (Tg) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates were analyzed. I/R injury induced neurovascular degeneration, energy failure, DNA damage, and necroptosis in the retinas of WT mice. In contrast, the GAPDH Tg mice showed resistance to all of these injury-induced abnormalities. In addition, I/R-induced effects were further examined in a neuroblastoma cell line and an endothelial cell line, which were transfected with a vector encoding human GAPDH or a control vector. After I/R challenge, energy failure, DNA damage, and elevation of receptor-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase (RIP) 1/3 were observed in the cells transfected with the control vector. However, overexpression of GAPDH in these cells prevented the injury-induced RIP3 up-regulation by restoring energy production and preventing DNA damage. Together, the protective role of GAPDH in retinal neurovascular degeneration after I/R injury provides a better understanding of the underlying mechanism of I/R injury and a potential therapeutic target to attenuate I/R injury-related diseases.—Cai, R., Xue, W., Liu, S., Petersen, R.

Caspase-3-mediated apoptosis accounts for the death in a small proportion of infected CD4 cells. To date, there have been no reports on the dynamics of Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 and their relationship with disease progression in acute HIV-1 infection. In this study, two distinct HIV-1 patient groups were enrolled. The CD4High group maintained a CD4 level above450 cells/μl while CD4 levels in the CD4Low group dropped below 250 cells/μl within 2 years after infection. Blood samples were collected at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 and 24 months after HIV infection. Plasma Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 levels in the two patients groups were determined by a single-step ELISA using commercially available monoclonal antibodies. The results showed that Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 levels in the CD4High group increased rapidly and then decreased within a short time during early HIV-1 infection. In contrast, Caspase-1 and Caspase-3 levels in the CD4Low group were obviously increased after 1 year of HIV-1 infection."

Isokinetic dynamometry is a method of muscle assessment useful to measure the muscular strength giving a quantification of the weakness, but only few studies about isokinetic assessment were performed in PD. The aims of the study were to evaluate the muscle strength in PD and to investigate the differences in patients affected on the right and left side.Knee flexor and extensor muscles strength was assessed using an isokinetic dynamometer in 25 patients in stage 3 H&Y and in 15 healthy controls. Subjects were tested in both legs at three fixed angular velocities: 90°/s, 120°/s, 180°/s.Considering the whole population of Parkinsonians, no difference in strength was observed with respect to controls. Considering the side, patients affected on the right side showed a clear tendency to be weaker than patients affected on the left side and controls.PD patients affected on the right side, but not those affected on the left side, had a reduction in muscle strength as compared to controls. We postulate a central origin deficit in muscle strength in PD. It is known that dopamine transporter binding is more severely reduced in the left posterior putamen and our results suggest that the control of the muscle strength in PD is linked to the right-left hemispheric asymmetry of the functional organization of basal ganglia and with their connections to cortical motor and pre-motor areas."

In phase 1 we performed a face-to-face interview of eligible individuals living in a rural community in Shanghai using a 4-item screening questionnaire. In phase 2, sleep specialists performed a phone interview of the individuals who screened positive to diagnosis RLS.Forty-one RLS cases were confirmed among 2941 eligible individuals 18 years of age or older in the study community. The prevalence of RLS was 1.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.0-1.9%), with a significantly higher rate observed in females (1.9% [95%CI =1.3-2.7%]) than that in males (0.9% [95%CI = 0.5-1.5%], p = 0.019). The prevalence rate increased significantly with age, from 0.2% (95% CI = 0.08-0.6%) in those 18-39 years old to 4.1% (95% CI = 2.1-7.9%) in those ≥ 70 years old (p < 0.001). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that gastritis, anemia and hypertension were risk factors for RLS. The sensitivity and specificity of the 4-item screening questionnaire used in this study were 63.4% and 97.5%, respectively.RLS prevalence is relatively low among Chinese adults living in rural Shanghai. Furthermore, population-based studies with a larger sample size and a longitudinal follow-up may help to determine the risk factors of RLS and potential interventions for RLS."
https://openalex.org/W2044701661,"Introduction The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of dental caries and the DMFT index, as well as the distribution pattern of pit and fissure sealants on permanent teeth in a Portuguese sample of adolescents, and to assess whether the existing usage of sealants and socio-demographic factors are correlated to caries prevalence on the examined sample. Materials and Methods A cross-sectional study was designed with a sample of 447 adolescents aged 12 to 18 years old, attending a public school in Sátão, Portugal. A self-administered questionnaire with questions about oral health behaviours and socio-economic status was answered by adolescents in the classroom. Clinical examination of oral health status and assessment of fissure sealants were accomplished by only one trained member of the research team. Results We obtained a DMFT index of 3.32 (2.92), which indicates a moderate level of prevalence of dental caries. When considering a DMFT = 0, we found significant statistical differences between the parents´ level of education (≤ 4th grade = 26.3 vs 5th–12th grade = 18.8 vs <12th grade = 43.3, p = 0.001), gender (male = 27.3 vs female = 19.6, p = 0.04), age (≤15 years = 27.1 vs <15 years = 18.5, p = 0.02), presence of fissure sealants (yes = 30.6 vs no = 13.5, p = 0.001) and experience of dental pain (no = 25.4 vs yes = 16.8, p = 0.02). When analyzing the prevalence of fissure sealants, we verified that 58.8% of adolescents had at least one fissure sealant applied. Significant statistical differences were found when analyzing the presence of fissure sealants related with parents´educational level (<9th grade, OR = 1.56 CI95% = 1.05–2.54), gender (female, OR = 1.86 CI95% = 1.19–2.98), experience of dental pain (yes, OR = 0.62 CI95% = 0.39–0.97) and presence of dental caries (yes, OR = 0.35 CI95% = 0.19–0.65). Conclusions The moderate level of caries prevalence reveals the need of improvement of primary prevention interventions among Portuguese adolescents. The establishment of a more targeted preventive program with better and more effective oral health education is essential, having into account socio-demographic aspects."

However, nasal tip collapse and saddle deformities occur occasionally. We utilized a mechanical approach to determine the safe width size for the L-strut in contact with the maxillary crest. Five L-strut models were designed based on computed tomography data (80 patients) and previous studies (55 patients). All L-strut models connected the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid bone (PPE) and the maxillary crest and were assumed to be fixed to the PPE and maxillary crest. An approximated daily load was applied to the dorsal portion of the L-strut. Finite element analyses were performed to compare the stress, strain, and displacement distribution of all L-strut models. According to the differences in the contact area between the caudal L-strut and maxillary crest, there are significant differences in terms of the stress, strain, and displacement distribution in the L-strut. High stresses occurred at the inner corner of the L-strut when 60 - 100% of the strut was in contact with the maxillary crest. High stresses also occurred at the inferior portion of the caudal L-strut when 20 - 40% of the caudal strut was in contact with maxillary crest. We conclude that it is important to preserve the 1-cm width L-strut caudal segment, which corresponds to the portion posterior to a vertical line drawn from the rhinion to the ANS. In particular, we must maintain more than 40% of the contact area between the L-strut and the maxillary crest when the septal cartilage in the caudal portion of the L-strut is harvested."

https://openalex.org/W1977080611,"Budding yeast Rap1 is a specific double-stranded DNA-binding protein involved in repression and activation of gene transcription and in the establishment of the nucleoprotein complex formed at telomeres. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of Rap1 forms a high affinity complex with DNA where both Myb-like domains bind to the recognition site. However, we recently showed that the DBD can also access an alternative, lower affinity DNA-binding mode where a single Myb-like domain binds. This results in Rap1-DNA complexes with stoichiometry higher than previously anticipated. In this work, we show that the ability of the DBD to form higher stoichiometry complexes on DNA is maintained also in larger Rap1 constructs. This indicates that transition between at least two DNA-binding modes is a general property of the protein and not a specific feature of the DBD in isolation. The transition between binding modes is modulated by the C-terminal wrapping loop within the DBD, consistent with the proposed model in which the transient opening of this region allows a switch between binding modes. Finally, we provide evidence that the Rap1 C terminus interacts with the DNA-binding domain, suggesting a complex network of interactions that couples changes in conformation of the protein to the binding of its DNA recognition sequence.Background: Rap1 is a general regulator of transcription and a component of the telomere.Results: Rap1 binds DNA in at least two binding modes.Conclusion: Access to binding modes in vitro is affected by different regions of the protein.Significance: The ability of Rap1 to access different binding modes may impact its functions.

This indicates that transition between at least two DNA-binding modes is a general property of the protein and not a specific feature of the DBD in isolation. The transition between binding modes is modulated by the C-terminal wrapping loop within the DBD, consistent with the proposed model in which the transient opening of this region allows a switch between binding modes. Finally, we provide evidence that the Rap1 C terminus interacts with the DNA-binding domain, suggesting a complex network of interactions that couples changes in conformation of the protein to the binding of its DNA recognition sequence. Background: Rap1 is a general regulator of transcription and a component of the telomere. Results: Rap1 binds DNA in at least two binding modes. Conclusion: Access to binding modes in vitro is affected by different regions of the protein. Significance: The ability of Rap1 to access different binding modes may impact its functions. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1 (repressor activator protein 1) is a multifunctioning protein acting as a key regulator of gene transcription and chromosomal integrity. Rap1 was first discovered as a repressor of the HMR/HML silent mating-type loci and an activator of gene expression for ribosomal protein genes and glycolytic enzymes (1.Lieb J.D. Liu X. Botstein D.

Shore D. RAP1 protein activates and silences transcription of mating-type genes in yeast.Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 616-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), hence earning its designation as both a repressor and activator. Rap1 is also a critical regulator of telomere homeostasis responsible for proper maintenance of telomere length and integrity (4.Conrad M.N. Wright J.H. Wolf A.J. Zakian V.A.

Rap1 binds directly to telomeric DNA (7.Buchman A.R. Kimmerly W.J. Rine J. Kornberg R.D.

The DBD consists of two tandem Myb-like motifs, followed by a C-terminal wrapping loop (23.Konig P. Giraldo R. Chapman L. Rhodes D.

The orientation of the C-terminal domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1 protein is determined by its binding to DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the most recent crystal structure of the DBD bound to a telomeric recognition sequence, this loop interacts with the N-terminal Myb-like domain, forming a closed complex on DNA (25.Matot B. Le Bihan Y.V. Lescasse R. Pérez J. Miron S. David G. Castaing B. Weber P. Raynal B. Zinn-Justin S. Gasparini S. Le Du M.H. The orientation of the C-terminal domain of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Rap1 protein is determined by its binding to DNA.Nucleic Acids Res. 2012; 40: 3197-3207Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Within the C-terminal wrapping loop, residues 591–597 were recently identified as being important for cell viability (25.Matot B. Le Bihan Y.V. Lescasse R. Pérez J. Miron S. David G. Castaing B.

Following the C-terminal wrapping loop is the tox region, identified as being responsible for toxicity upon overexpression of Rap1 (26.Freeman K. Gwadz M. Shore D. Molecular and genetic-analysis of the toxic effect of Rap1 overexpression in yeast.Genetics. 1995; 141: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the “act” domain, responsible for transcriptional activation (27.Hardy C.F.J.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1209-1217Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Finally, the Rap1 C-terminal (RCT) domain (residues 672–827) contains the region required for recruitment of the known Rap1-interacting proteins (9.Wotton D. Shore D.

DNA-binding domain isothermal titration calorimetry 6-carboxyfluorescein Rap1 and BRCA1 C-terminal domains, respectively FAM-labeled RCT domain. We recently showed that in addition to the known high affinity complex observed in the crystal structures, the DBD forms, with lower affinity, complexes with higher stoichiometry (30.Feldmann E.A. Galletto R. The DNA-binding domain of yeast Rap1 interacts with double-stranded DNA in multiple binding modes.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 7471-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Access to these complexes is independent of the presence of a Rap1 recognition sequence. We proposed that access to these higher stoichiometry complexes is due to the ability of the DBD to transition between at least two DNA-binding modes. In the high affinity mode, both Myb-like domains bind to the hemisites within the recognition sequence. In the alternative lower affinity mode, only one Myb-like domain binds to DNA. One basic feature of this model proposes that the transient opening of the C-terminal wrapping loop within the DBD modulates the ability of Rap1 to access the alternative binding mode. In this work, we used different DBD constructs with varying lengths of the wrapping loop and different deletions of this region within larger Rap1 constructs to test the proposed model. We show that the residues spanning positions 591–597 of the DBD contain a region important for “latching” the C-terminal wrapping loop into the high affinity state. Deletion of this domain releases the “lock” of the 1:1 complex, favoring access to the alternate binding modes and thus formation of higher stoichiometric complexes. Moreover, we show that the ability to access higher stoichiometry on dsDNA (i.e. multiple binding modes) is not an exclusive property of the DBD in isolation but rather a feature maintained in the full-length protein. Also, we provide evidence that the RCT domain affects the maximum stoichiometry achievable on these model substrates and that complex conformational changes couple Rap1 to DNA binding. All chemicals used were reagent grade. All solutions were prepared with distilled and deionized Milli-Q water (18 megaohms at 25 °C). Oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA Technology (Coralville, IA). Annealed duplex dsDNAs were prepared by mixing equimolar concentrations of each oligonucleotide strand in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm MgCl2 and incubated in a preheated 95 °C water bath, followed by slow cooling to room temperature. The “top” strands of the oligonucleotides used are as follows (for DNAs with 6-carboxyfluorescein (FAM) or Cy3 the position is indicated, and the hemisites are underlined): TeloA, 5′-CCGCACACCCACACACCAGTG (5′- FAM, 3′-FAM, 5′-Cy3); RPG, 5′-CCGCACACCCATACATTAGTG (5′-FAM); HMRE, 5′-CCGCAAACCCATCAACCAGTG (5′-FAM, 3′-FAM, 5′-Cy3); RND, 5′-CCGCCGCGGAACTTATTAGTG (5′-FAM, 3′-FAM, 5′-Cy3); TeloS, 5′-CCGCACACCCACACCAGTG (5′-FAM, 5′-Cy3). Full-length Rap1 was initially cloned from S. cerevisiae strain W303 and provided in pET30a (Recombinant DNA Laboratory, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX). All of the subsequent Rap1 constructs, including full-length Rap1, were generated with standard molecular biology techniques and inserted into pGEX-6p-1 at EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites. The RCT domain (residues 672–827) bearing the single C741S or C757S mutation was also cloned in pGEX-6p-1. The proteins were overexpressed from Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS by growing cells in LB-Miller broth at 37 °C until the A600 measured 0.6–0.8 and then quickly chilled and induced with 0.7 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C for overnight expression. Harvested cell pellets were stored at −80 °C for later use. The DNA-binding domains of Rap1 comprising residues 358–579 (DBD579), 358–590 (DBD590), and 358–615 (DBD615) were purified with a two-column purification strategy as described recently (30.Feldmann E.A. Galletto R. The DNA-binding domain of yeast Rap1 interacts with double-stranded DNA in multiple binding modes.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 7471-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, after cell lysis, the clarified supernatant was incubated with 0.3% (v/v) polyethyleneimine, recovered in the supernatant, and incubated overnight with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow GST affinity resin (GE Healthcare). After on-column cleavage of the GST tag, the DBD constructs were directly loaded on a Poros 50 HE Heparin (Life Technologies, Inc.) and eluted at 600 mm NaCl. The construct comprising residues 1–601 (Rap1(1–601)) and 440–601 (Myb-C) followed the same procedure. Rap1 constructs comprising residues 358–827 (DBD827, DBD + linker + RCT domain) and its internal deletion constructs were eluted from Poros 50 HE Heparin with 300 mm NaCl. Full-length Rap1 and residues 440–827 (Myb-C827) were dialyzed overnight against Buffer D50 (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3 at 4 °C), 50 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm PMSF) before loading onto heparin and then eluted with Buffer D containing 250 mm NaCl. The RCT domain variants (residues 672–827) were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow GST affinity resin after on-column cleavage. Finally, all of the protein constructs were dialyzed overnight against Storage Buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 400 mm NaCl, 40% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, and 0.5 mm EDTA) and stored at −80 °C for later use. Unless otherwise indicated, prior to experiments, the proteins were dialyzed against Buffer HN50 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol), including 1 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine for cysteine-containing constructs. All proteins were quantified spectrophotometrically using calculated extinction coefficients (31.Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Calculation of protein extinction coefficients from amino-acid sequence data.Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar, 32.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. How to measure and predict the molar absorption-coefficient of a protein.Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3436) Google Scholar). The RCT domains containing a single cysteine were labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein maleimide (Invitrogen) by incubating overnight with a 10-fold excess of dye in 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 μm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine). Unincorporated dye was removed by size exclusion using Bio-Rad P6 matrix. The labeled protein was concentrated and dialyzed overnight against Storage Buffer before storing at −80 °C. Before use, the labeled RCT domain (FAMRCT) was dialyzed in Buffer HN50 and quantitated using the extinction coefficient of FAM at 495 nm (78,000 liters mol−1 cm−1). The different Rap1 constructs and their abbreviations are shown in Fig. 1b. All sedimentation experiments were collected on an Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using a An60Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed using Epon charcoal-filled six-sector centerpieces at the appropriate rpm with 0.001-cm spacing, scanned every 4 h, averaged from 10 replicates, and recorded at 545 nm to monitor the Cy3-labeled DNA. The data were processed and analyzed with SedFit/SedPhat (Peter Schuck) (33.Schuck P. On the analysis of protein self-association by sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation.Anal.

The DNA-binding domain of yeast Rap1 interacts with double-stranded DNA in multiple binding modes.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 7471-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments with the labeled RCT domain were performed using Epon charcoal-filled two-sector centerpieces and scanning at 500 nm, where the unlabeled proteins do not contribute to the signal. EMSAs with labeled or unlabeled dsDNAs were performed on 6 or 8% acrylamide/bisacrylamide 1× TBE minigels with running buffer prechilled at 4 °C. Gels were scanned using a Typhoon 9400 variable mode imager (GE Healthcare). EMSAs with unlabeled DNAs were stained with GelRed (Phenix Research, Candler, NC) and scanned on an Alpha Imager HP imager (Protein Simple, Santa Clara, CA). All fluorescence titrations were performed with an L-format PC1 spectrofluorimeter (ISS, Champaign, IL) equipped with Glenn-Thompson polarizers. Measurements of the anisotropy and total fluorescence intensity of FAM-labeled DNA were recorded using excitation and emission wavelengths of 480 and 530 nm, respectively, as described (30.Feldmann E.A. Galletto R. The DNA-binding domain of yeast Rap1 interacts with double-stranded DNA in multiple binding modes.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 7471-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The experiments were performed using a VP-ITC calorimeter (Microcal, GE Healthcare) after extensive dialysis of both the protein and the DNA in Buffer HN50. Titrations were carried out with 10-μl injections of 20 μm titrant into 2 μm samples containing either protein or duplex DNA, at either 20 or 30 °C. Reference titrations to account for the heat of dilution of each titrant were performed by titrating into sample cells loaded with the appropriate reaction buffer and equilibrated at the appropriate temperature. Fig. 1a shows the model we recently proposed to explain the ability of the DBD of Rap1 to access different binding modes on dsDNA (30.Feldmann E.A. Galletto R. The DNA-binding domain of yeast Rap1 interacts with double-stranded DNA in multiple binding modes.Biochemistry. 2014; 53: 7471-7483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). One prediction of this model is that deletion of the C-terminal wrapping loop of the DBD should favor the transition between binding modes. To test this prediction, we generated constructs where the C-terminal wrapping loop has been partially or entirely deleted (Fig. 1b). The first DBD variant comprises residues 358–590 (DBD590), which removes the latch that makes direct interaction with the N-terminal Myb-like domain of the DBD (25.Matot B. Le Bihan Y.V. Lescasse R.

The second DBD variant comprises residues 358–579 (DBD579), which remove the entire C-terminal wrapping loop as defined by the crystal structure of the DBD bound to DNA (23.Konig P. Giraldo R.

As a control, we also generated an extended version of the DBD that comprises residues 358–615 (DBD615) to include part of the toxicity region shown to relieve the growth inhibition phenotype observed by overexpression of Rap1 (26.Freeman K. Gwadz M. Shore D. Molecular and genetic-analysis of the toxic effect of Rap1 overexpression in yeast.Genetics. 1995; 141: 1253-1262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed EMSAs at different DNA concentrations to target either formation of the high affinity, 1:1 complex or the lower affinity, higher stoichiometry complexes. Fig. 2, a and b, shows EMSAs at 30 nm TeloA or HMRE (labeled at the 5′-end with FAM) as a function of the concentration of the different DBD constructs. For TeloA, containing the high affinity Rap1 recognition sequence found at telomeres (7.Buchman A.R. Kimmerly W.J. Rine J. Kornberg R.D.

Use of a selection technique to identify the diversity of binding sites for the yeast RAP1 transcription factor.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 124-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), all of the DBDs bind to the substrate, with little apparent effect of deleting the C-terminal wrapping loop. However, for HMRE, which contains the lower affinity recognition sequence found at the HM locus (2.Shore D. Nasmyth K. Purification and cloning of a DNA binding protein from yeast that binds to both silencer and activator elements.Cell. 1987; 51: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), DBD579 does not bind to the substrate at this concentration. Even for DBD590, which is missing the latch region, the affinity for HMRE appears to be reduced. This suggests that the C-terminal wrapping loop and potentially just the latch region contribute significantly to the stabilization of the 1:1 complex formed on a moderate affinity recognition sequence. The stoichiometry (Table 1) of the protein-DNA complexes formed with the different DBD variants at saturating protein concentration was determined by equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation experiments with TeloA, HMRE, RND (a dsDNA of random composition), and TeloS (a 19-bp dsDNA that contains two direct repeats as in TeloA but spaced by only 1 bp) (see “Experimental Procedures”). Independent of the dsDNA sequence, all of the tested DBD constructs form a 3:1 complex at saturation, indicating that the changes in the C-terminal wrapping loop do not affect the maximum achievable stoichiometry.TABLE 1Molecular mass of protein-DNA complexes for different DBD constructs determined by equilibrium analytical sedimentation monitoring the absorbance of Cy3 at 550 nmDBD615DBD590DBD579Mass (observed)P/DMass (observed)P/DMass (observed)P/DkDakDakDaCy3-TeloANDND97.2 ± 0.82.98 ± 0.0385.8 ± 0.22.67 ± 0.07Cy3-HMRE95.0 ± 0.32.63 ± 0.01103.6 ± 0.43.20 ± 0.02104.7 ± 0.63.37 ± 0.02Cy3-RNDNDNDNDND101.3 ± 0.33.25 ± 0.09Cy3-TeloS93.3 ± 0.72.61 ± 0.0391.5 ± 0.12.8 ± 0.0494.0 ± 0.23.02 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab Next, we examined the propensity of the different DBD constructs to access these higher stoichiometry complexes. Fig. 2, c and d, shows EMSAs targeting the singly (PD) and multiply bound (PnD) species formed at 2 μm TeloA or HMRE. For TeloA, the three examined DBD constructs show very similar behavior. However, for HMRE, the data show that as the C-terminal wrapping loop is shortened, the DBD becomes more prone to access the higher stoichiometry complexes. Indeed, for DBD579, formation of PD is not clearly detectable, and at a 2-fold excess of protein, the complex is already in the multiply bound state (PnD). This suggests that removal of the C-terminal wrapping loop in the DBD favors transition to higher stoichiometry (i.e. transition between binding modes). Binding of the different DBD variants was also monitored by the change in anisotropy of FAM-labeled DNA (Fig. 2e). As recently r"
https://openalex.org/W2003906819,"In all but the most sterile environments bacteria will reside in fluid being transported through conduits and some of these will attach and grow as biofilms on the conduit walls. The concentration and diversity of bacteria in the fluid at the point of delivery will be a mix of those when it entered the conduit and those that have become entrained into the flow due to seeding from biofilms. Examples include fluids through conduits such as drinking water pipe networks, endotracheal tubes, catheters and ventilation systems. Here we present two probabilistic models to describe changes in the composition of bulk fluid microbial communities as they are transported through a conduit whilst exposed to biofilm communities. The first (discrete) model simulates absolute numbers of individual cells, whereas the other (continuous) model simulates the relative abundance of taxa in the bulk fluid. The discrete model is founded on a birth-death process whereby the community changes one individual at a time and the numbers of cells in the system can vary. The continuous model is a stochastic differential equation derived from the discrete model and can also accommodate changes in the carrying capacity of the bulk fluid. These models provide a novel Lagrangian framework to investigate and predict the dynamics of migrating microbial communities. In this paper we compare the two models, discuss their merits, possible applications and present simulation results in the context of drinking water distribution systems. Our results provide novel insight into the effects of stochastic dynamics on the composition of non-stationary microbial communities that are exposed to biofilms and provides a new avenue for modelling microbial dynamics in systems where fluids are being transported."
https://openalex.org/W2147995582,"Cell fate is determined by the balance of conserved molecular mechanisms regulating death (apoptosis) and survival (autophagy). Autophagy is a process by which cells recycle their organelles and macromolecules through degradation within the vacuole in yeast and plants, and lysosome in metazoa. In the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, autophagy is strongly induced under nitrogen starvation and in aging cells. Previously, we demonstrated that calnexin (Cnx1p), a highly conserved transmembrane chaperone of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), regulates apoptosis under ER stress or inositol starvation. Moreover, we showed that in stationary phase, Cnx1p is cleaved into two moieties, L_Cnx1p and S_Cnx1p. Here, we show that the processing of Cnx1p is regulated by autophagy, induced by nitrogen starvation or cell aging. The cleavage of Cnx1p involves two vacuolar proteases: Isp6, which is essential for autophagy, and its paralogue Psp3. Blocking autophagy through the knockout of autophagy-related genes (atg) results in inhibition of both, the cleavage and the trafficking of Cnx1p from the ER to the vacuole. We demonstrate that Cnx1p is required for cell survival under nitrogen-starvation and in chronological aging cultures. The death of the mini_cnx1 mutant (overlapping S_cnx1p) cells is accompanied by accumulation of high levels of reactive-oxygen species (ROS), a slowdown in endocytosis and severe cell-wall defects. Moreover, mutant cells expressing only S_Cnx1p showed cell wall defects. Co-expressing mutant overlapping the L_Cnx1p and S_Cnx1p cleavage products reverses the death, ROS phenotype and cell wall defect to wild-type levels. As it is involved in both apoptosis and autophagy, Cnx1p could be a nexus for the crosstalk between these pro-death and pro-survival mechanisms. Ours, and observations in mammalian systems, suggest that the multiple roles of calnexin depend on its sub-cellular localization and on its cleavage. The use of S. pombe should assist in further shedding light on the multiple roles of calnexin."
https://openalex.org/W2063909420,"Air emissions from the U.S. pulp and paper sector have been federally regulated since 1978; however, regulations are periodically reviewed and revised to improve efficiency and effectiveness of existing emission standards. The Industrial Sectors Integrated Solutions (ISIS) model for the pulp and paper sector is currently under development at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and can be utilized to facilitate multi-pollutant, sector-based analyses that are performed in conjunction with regulatory development. The model utilizes a multi-sector, multi-product dynamic linear modeling framework that evaluates the economic impact of emission reduction strategies for multiple air pollutants. The ISIS model considers facility-level economic, environmental, and technical parameters, as well as sector-level market data, to estimate the impacts of environmental regulations on the pulp and paper industry. Specifically, the model can be used to estimate U.S. and global market impacts of new or more stringent air regulations, such as impacts on product price, exports and imports, market demands, capital investment, and mill closures. One major challenge to developing a representative model is the need for an extensive amount of data. This article discusses the collection and processing of data for use in the model, as well as the methods used for building the ISIS pulp and paper database that facilitates the required analyses to support the air quality management of the pulp and paper sector."

https://openalex.org/W1966348923,"Background Parental educational expectations have been associated with children’s educational attainment in a number of long-term longitudinal studies, but whether this relationship is causal has long been debated. The aims of this prospective study were twofold: 1) test whether low maternal educational expectations contributed to failure to graduate from high school; and 2) compare the results obtained using different strategies for accounting for confounding variables (i.e. multivariate regression and propensity score matching). Methodology/Principal Findings The study sample included 1,279 participants from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children. Maternal educational expectations were assessed when the participants were aged 12 years. High school graduation – measuring educational attainment – was determined through the Quebec Ministry of Education when the participants were aged 22–23 years. Findings show that when using the most common statistical approach (i.e. multivariate regressions to adjust for a restricted set of potential confounders) the contribution of low maternal educational expectations to failure to graduate from high school was statistically significant. However, when using propensity score matching, the contribution of maternal expectations was reduced and remained statistically significant only for males. Conclusions/Significance The results of this study are consistent with the possibility that the contribution of parental expectations to educational attainment is overestimated in the available literature. This may be explained by the use of a restricted range of potential confounding variables as well as the dearth of studies using appropriate statistical techniques and study designs in order to minimize confounding. Each of these techniques and designs, including propensity score matching, has its strengths and limitations: A more comprehensive understanding of the causal role of parental expectations will stem from a convergence of findings from studies using different techniques and designs."

Following phosphorylation of its substrate domain, p130Cas promotes the integration of protein complexes involved in multiple signaling pathways and mediates cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration. In addition to the known BCAR1-1A (wild-type) and 1C variants, we identified four novel BCAR1 mRNA variants, generated by alternative first exon usage (1B, 1B1, 1D, and 1E). Exons 1A and 1C encode for four amino acids (aa), whereas 1D and 1E encode for 22 aa and 1B1 encodes for 50 aa. Exon 1B is non-coding, resulting in a truncated p130Cas protein (Cas1B). BCAR1-1A, 1B1, and variant 1C mRNAs were ubiquitously expressed in cell lines and a survey of human tissues, whereas 1B, 1D, and 1E expression was more restricted. Reconstitution of all isoforms except for 1B in p130Cas-deficient murine fibroblasts induced lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling, which was unrelated to the substrate domain phosphorylation status.

This is of special interest because the amino acids (aa) encoded by exon 1 directly flank the p130Cas SH3 domain. Different N-terminal extensions may influence the interactions of the SH3 domain with other proteins and thus the function of p130Cas. Of note, the p130Cas SH3 domain and its interaction with FAK are necessary for the phosphorylation and translocation of p130Cas to focal adhesions (FAs) (16.Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S.

Real time PCR was performed in 20-μl reactions in triplicate using ABI PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system version 2.3 (Applied Biosystems) and 2× FastStart Universal SYBR Green PCR Master (ROX) (Roche Applied Science) using 10 ng of cDNA. Exon-overlapping PCR primers were applied, and the sequences are presented in Table 1. PCR specificity and amplicon size were validated by electrophoresis through a 2% agarose gel and subsequent sequencing. Efficiency of each PCR was >98% as determined by performing the PCRs for each primer pair with serial DNA dilutions. Comparative Ct method was applied for relative quantification of expression of each gene between samples (29.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D.

Some proteins were separated on low-bis (ratio 149:1) SDS-polyacrylamide gels as indicated. For immunoprecipitation (IP) of FAK, 293T cells transiently transfected with FAK-pcDNA3 or p130Cas N-terminal (NT) constructs in pcDNA4-V5 or Cas−/− stable p130Cas variant transductants were lysed in HNTG (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA) buffer. Lysates containing ectopically expressed FAK were mixed with lysates expressing p130Cas NT or full-length p130Cas and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h prior to incubation with V5 (1 μg) or p130Cas (2 μg) antibodies (abs) at 4 °C overnight. Washed GammaBindTM G-SepharoseTM beads (GE Healthcare) were added to the samples for an additional 90 min at 4 °C. Precipitates were washed four times with ice-cold HNTG buffer (0.1% Triton X-100) and then subjected to immunoblotting. The following antibodies were used: mAbs, β-actin (Sigma), FAK (Clone 77, BD Transduction Laboratories), p130Cas (immunoblotting, clone 21, BD, Transduction Laboratories), and V5 (Invitrogen); polyclonal rabbit abs, p130Cas (IP, C-20, sc-860, Santa Cruz Biotechnology); phosphospecific anti-p130Cas tyrosines, 165 (4015), 249 (4014), and 410 (4011) (Cell Signaling). Cas variant cells (migration, 7.5 × 104; invasion, 5 × 104) were layered in the upper compartments of a Transwell (migration) chamber or invasion chambers (both chambers: 6.5-mm-diameter polycarbonate filter; 8-μm pore size; Costar) and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h (migration) or 22 h (invasion). Culture medium (20% calf serum) was added to the lower compartment. Migration and invasion of the cells to the underside of the filter were evaluated by staining with crystal violet and quantified by counting the cells in three random fields per experiment. Three independent assays were performed in triplicate. Cells were washed twice with 1× PBS, lysed in PBS/0.5% SDS, and incubated at 95 °C for 10 min. Cell lysates (60 μg) were treated with 20 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (New England Biolabs) or water control in New England Biolabs buffer 3 for 1 h at 37 °C and subjected to immunoblotting as described. We recently described two BCAR1 exon 1 variants (BCAR1-1 and BCAR1-1′, which we refer to here as Cas1A and Cas1C, respectively) (10.Kumbrink J. Kirsch K.H. Regulation of p130Cas/BCAR1 expression in tamoxifen-sensitive and tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells by EGR1 and NAB2.Neoplasia. 2012; 14: 108-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we investigated whether additional p130Cas variants with different functions exist. Subsequent comprehensive database analyses revealed that BCAR1 contains five additional exons upstream of exon 1 (1A, first identified WT, RefSeq NM_014567.3) (Fig. 1). ESTs and cap analysis of gene expression tag databases suggested that these exons represent alternative first exons, hence designated by their genomic position related to 1A as exons 1B (XM_005256260.2), 1B1 (NM_001170714.1), 1C (NM_001170718), 1D (NM_001170716.1), and 1E (NM_001170715.1). Exons 1A and 1C encode for four aa, whereas 1D and 1E translate into 22 aa (Fig. 1C). Exon 1B1 encodes for 50 aa. Exon 1B is non-coding, leading to a truncated form of the p130Cas protein (Cas1B) starting at aa 30 in reference to Cas1A, thereby lacking 24 aa of the SH3 domain (aa 6–64). The variant proteins 1A and 1C are evolutionarily conserved in mammals, whereas the longer variants 1B1, 1D, and 1E were only identified in primates (TABLE 2, TABLE 3). The truncated 1B isoform was detected in Primates (Hominidae only) and Cetacea. Once complete genetic information of lower mammalian species or other classes is available, the variants may also be identified in additional species. Motif analysis of the NT region of p130Cas revealed that Cas1A and 1C and the novel variant proteins Cas1B1, 1D, and 1E contain a YDNV motif representing a putative phosphorylation site (Tyr-12/58/30) at aa 12–15, 58–61, and 30–33, respectively, and a SPDELSFR motif at aa 18–25/64–71/36–43 predicted for phosphorylation at Ser-23/69/41. In addition, the longer variants Cas1D and Cas1E comprise a predicted phosphorylation site at Thr-15. The longest variant Cas1B1 contains additional potential interaction motifs at aa 4–8, 6–13, 15–19, and 40–46. Therefore, BCAR1 has six first exons resulting in protein isoforms that possibly possess altered functions.TABLE 2Database analysis of p130Cas exon 1 variant proteinsSpeciesCas1ACas1BCas1CCas1DCas1EHomo sapiensM NHLProtein starts at aa 30 in exon 2M SVPMLTHRPQEAEQ RGRTPGPSFEWMHCPGEAPLAA PRPTPKDPCLRPan troglodytesM NHLProtein starts at aa 30 in exon 2M SVPMLTHRPQEAEQ RGRTPGPSFEWMHCPGEAPLAA PRPTPKDPCLRMacaca mulattaM NHLNot foundNot foundMLTHRPQAAEQRGQTPAPSFGWMHCPGEAPLAA PRPTPKDPCLRPhyseter catodonM NYLProtein starts at aa 30 in exon 2M SVPNot foundNot foundBos taurusM NYLNot foundM SVPNot foundNot foundRattus norvegicusM KYLNot foundM TVPNot foundNot foundMus musculusM KYLNot foundM TVPNot foundNot found Open table in a new tab TABLE 3Database analysis of p130Cas exon 1 variant Cas1B1SpeciesCas1B1Homo sapiensM PAKPFLSSVLLSWKVLDFSGPGPQGTGQPCSCGHWAEGQGGPPEPAGGPPan troglodytesM PAKPFLSSVLLSWKVLDFSGPGPQGTGQPCSCGHWAEGQGGPPEPAGGPMacaca mulattaM PTKPFLSSALLSWKVLDFSGPGPQETGQPRSCGHETEGQGEPPEPAGGTPhyseter catodonNot foundBos taurusNot foundRattus norvegicusNot foundMus musculusNot found Open table in a new tab To reveal the expression pattern of the BCAR1 exon 1 variants, real time RT-PCR was performed on mRNA isolated from immortalized mammary epithelial (MCF-10A), estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) MCF-7 and T47D, ER-negative (ER−) BT-20 breast carcinoma, and human fibroblastic (BJ1) cells (Fig. 2A). The highest relative expression was detected for BCAR1-1A, 1C, and 1E in all cell lines, whereas 1B, 1B1, and 1D levels were lower. When compared with MCF-10A in T47D and BT-20 cells, significantly higher levels of 1B (4.8- and 4.3-fold, respectively), 1B1 (3.8- and 8.7-fold), 1C (2.1- and 3.2-fold), and 1E (4.4- and 2-fold) were found (Fig. 2A, right panel). To further analyze the abundance of the isoforms, real time RT-PCR was conducted on major human organs (breast, colon, stomach, liver, kidney, and rectum) and breast carcinoma and colon carcinoma (Fig. 2B). Three samples from each tissue were investigated. As observed for the cell lines, relative expression of BCAR1-1A, 1C, and 1E was stronger when compared with 1B, 1B1, and 1D. The variants 1A, 1B1, and 1C were ubiquitously expressed. A more restricted pattern was observed for 1B (detected in only 15 out of 24 samples), 1D (17 out of 24), and 1E (18 out of 24), especially in normal colon and kidney. No trends in expression differences of the variants between normal breast and breast carcinoma were found. Interestingly, isoform 1E was not expressed in normal colon, whereas all colon carcin"
https://openalex.org/W2949297310,"A practical approach to understanding lateral asymmetries in body, brain, and cognition would be to examine the performance advantages/disadvantages associated with the corresponding functions and behavior. In the present study, we examined whether the division of labor in hand usage, marked by the preferential usage of the two hands across manual operations requiring maneuvering in three-dimensional space (e.g., reaching for food, grooming, and hitting an opponent) and those requiring physical strength (e.g., climbing), is associated with higher hand performance in free-ranging bonnet macaques, Macaca radiata. We determined the extent to which the macaques exhibit laterality in hand usage in an experimental unimanual and a bimanual food-reaching task, and the extent to which manual laterality is associated with hand performance in an experimental hand-performance-differentiation task. We observed negative relationships between (a) the latency in food extraction by the preferred hand in the hand-performance-differentiation task (wherein, lower latency implies higher performance), the preferred hand determined using the bimanual food-reaching task, and the normalized difference between the performance of the two hands, and (b) the normalized difference between the performance of the two hands and the absolute difference between the laterality in hand usage in the unimanual and the bimanual food-reaching tasks (wherein, lesser difference implies higher manual specialization). Collectively, these observations demonstrate that the division of labor between the two hands is associated with higher hand performance."
https://openalex.org/W2014126817,"While mental associations between a brand and its marketing elements are an important part of brand equity, previous research has yet to provide a sound methodology to measure the strength of these links. The following studies present the development and validation of an implicit measure to assess the strength of mental representations of brand elements in the mind of the consumer. The measure described in this paper, which we call the Brand Discrimination task, requires participants to identify whether images of brand elements (e.g. color, logo, packaging) belong to a target brand or not. Signal detection theory (SDT) is used to calculate a Brand Discrimination index which gives a measure of overall recognition accuracy for a brand’s elements in the context of its competitors. A series of five studies shows that the Brand Discrimination task can discriminate between strong and weak brands, increases when mental representations of brands are experimentally strengthened, is relatively stable across time, and can predict brand choice, independently and while controlling for other explicit and implicit brand evaluation measures. Together, these studies provide unique evidence for the importance of mental brand representations in marketing and consumer behavior, along with a research methodology to measure this important consumer-based brand attribute."
https://openalex.org/W1990743097,"Background Controversy exists as to whether obesity constitutes a risk-factor or a protective-factor for the development of nosocomial Infection (NI). According to the obesity-paradox, there is evidence that moderate obesity is a protective-factor. In Mexico few studies have focused on the nutritional status (NS) distribution in the hospital setting. Objectives The aim of this study was to estimate the distribution of NS and the prevalence of nosocomial infection NI among adult elective surgery (ES) patients and to compare the clinical and anthropometric characteristics and length of stays (LOS) between obese and non-obese patients and between patients with and without NI. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study with a sample (n = 82) adult ES patients (21–59 years old) who were recruited from a tertiary-care hospital. The prevalences of each NS category and NI were estimated, the assessments were compared between groups (Mann-Whitney, Chi-squared or the Fisher's-exact-test), and the association between preoperative risk-factors and NI was evaluated using odds ratios. Results The distribution of subjects by NS category was: underweight (3.66%), normal-weight (28.05%), overweight (35.36%), and obese (32.93%). The prevalence of NI was 14.63%. The LOS was longer (p<0.001) for the patients who developed NI. The percentages of NI were: 33.3% in underweight, 18.52% in obese, 17.39% in normal-weight, and 6.90% in overweight patients. Conclusion The prevalence of overweight and obesity in adult ES patients is high. The highest prevalence of NI occurred in the underweight and obese patients. The presence of NI considerably increased the LOS, resulting in higher medical care costs."
https://openalex.org/W1985805032,"Regulated proteolysis is known to control a variety of vital processes in apicomplexan parasites including invasion and egress of host cells. Serine proteases have been proposed as targets for drug development based upon inhibitor studies that show parasite attenuation and transmission blockage. Genetic studies suggest that serine proteases, such as subtilisin and rhomboid proteases, are essential but functional studies have proved challenging as active proteases are difficult to express. Proteinaceous Protease Inhibitors (PPIs) provide an alternative way to address the role of serine proteases in apicomplexan biology. To validate such an approach, a Neospora caninum Kazal inhibitor (NcPI-S) was expressed ectopically in two apicomplexan species, Toxoplasma gondii tachyzoites and Plasmodium berghei ookinetes, with the aim to disrupt proteolytic processes taking place within the secretory pathway. NcPI-S negatively affected proliferation of Toxoplasma tachyzoites, while it had no effect on invasion and egress. Expression of the inhibitor in P. berghei zygotes blocked their development into mature and invasive ookinetes. Moreover, ultra-structural studies indicated that expression of NcPI-S interfered with normal formation of micronemes, which was also confirmed by the lack of expression of the micronemal protein SOAP in these parasites. Our results suggest that NcPI-S could be a useful tool to investigate the function of proteases in processes fundamental for parasite survival, contributing to the effort to identify targets for parasite attenuation and transmission blockage."
