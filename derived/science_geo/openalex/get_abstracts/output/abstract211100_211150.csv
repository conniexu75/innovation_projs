https://openalex.org/W1965387759,Statistical treatment of recordings of spontaneous unit discharges from the ventromedial nucleus and the lateral area of the hypothalamus (the activities in one area being recorded while the other was stimulated) revealed significant reciprocal relations. The concept that glucose-sensitive neurons are present in the ventromedial nucleus was supported by the effects on the spontaneous unit discharges of injecting glucose and other-solutions intravenously.

https://openalex.org/W2062134291,A new method for determining the sequence of mutational sites is based on the linear dose-effect relation for x-ray induction of allelic recombination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations at two loci have been mapped by this method. The use of x-ray simplifies allelic mapping and greatly increases its sensitivity.

Transport studies in normal intestinal mucosa, in contrast to similar studies in the kidney, show that cystine and lysine are mutually inhibitory."

https://openalex.org/W2024477585,"Tarichatoxin (C(11)H(17)N(3)O(8)), a potent neurotoxin recently isolated in pure form from the eggs of the California newt, Taricha torosa, has been found to be identical to tetrodotoxin from the ovaries of Sphoeroides rubripes, the Japanese Fugu or puffer fish. As yet this substance has been detected only in a single family of fish, Tetraodontidae, and in a single family of amphibia, Salamandridae."

https://openalex.org/W2017876998,"Diverse potentiators of contraction have basically identical, activestate mechanical effects, but act by different membrane-mediated electromechanical coupling mechanisms. The falling phase of the action potential is greatly prolonged by Zn(2+) (0.1 mM) and UO(2)(2+) (0.5 to 1 microM), neither of which affects the mechanical threshold. Caffeine (1 mM), like the lyotropic anions, acts conversely. Thus changes in the duration and mechanical threshold of the action potential determine independent electromechanical coupling processes which can act individually, or conjointly in the action of other potentiators, in determining the duration of the active state and thus the potentiation of twitch tension."
https://openalex.org/W1983198484,"The suggestion is made that the mammalian muscle spindle may serve in part as a pressure sensor. Pressure acting nonuniformly on the spindle would express the intracapsular fluid distad, thus elongating the capsule. ""Intracapsular fibers,"" those intrafusal muscle fibers inserting into the capsule, would be lengthened, whereas ""percapsular fibers"" passing beyond the capsule would be relatively unaffected. Since ""flower-spray"" terminals are preferentially associated with the smaller intrafusal fibers, they would chiefly be concerned with the pressure sensing mechanism. Observations in support of this hypothesis are given."
https://openalex.org/W2013486717,"Lesions of the anterior ventral cochlear nucleus caused degeneration of synaptic endings in the anterior half of the nucleus of the trapezoid body. Lesions of the posterior ventral cochlear nucleus caused similar degeneration in the posterior half of the nucleus of the trapezoid body. Thus, the cochlea projects twice upon the nucleus of the trapezoid body."

https://openalex.org/W2078932883,"Extracts of brightly colored skins from nine amphibian species were analyzed chromatographically. In yellow skin in which xanthophores predominated, relatively large quantities of sepiapterin were found, while in red skin which was laden with erythrophores, three drosopterins were most prevalent. Frozen sections of skin indicated that pteridines were present within chromatophores, either alone or accompanied by carotenoids. It is concluded that sepiapterin and three drosopterins are utilized as pigments in amphibians and it is suggested that other less brightly colored pteridines also function in this respect. It no longer seems proper to make the tacit assumption that bright pigmentation of amphibians is due only to the presence of carotenoids."
https://openalex.org/W1969005422,"Intracellular recordings and electroencephalograms were obtained from neurons of the motor cortex during augmnenting responses elicited by repetitive stimulation of its specific thalamic nucleus. The postsynaptic potentials during fully developed augmenting responses consistedf two depolarizing waves with two separate groups of spike dicharges of different latencies, the bases of the spikes, the so-called ""firing-levels,"" sometimes shifting. This supports the concept that the postsynaptic potentials accompanying the augmentintg response consist of a primary response and a response of recruiting character."
https://openalex.org/W1996961356,"Antibody activity to thyroglobulin was identified in six classes of immunoglobulins in man, that is, in type I and type II, 6.6S gamma-globulins; in type I and type II, beta(2A)-globulins; and in type I and type II, gamma(1)-macroglobulins. These observations indicate that antibody-activity sites are separate from the part of the H chains of immunoglobulin molecules responsible for specific properties of 6.6S gamma-globulin, beta(2A)-globulin, or gamma(1M)-globulin, and, also, are separate from the part of L chains responsible for type I or type II characteristics of immunoglobulin molecules."

https://openalex.org/W2056557794,"A new endocrine function has been shown to play a role in insect morphogenesis. The hormone named proctodone is secreted by specialized cells of the hindgut and appears to affect the brain, resulting in the activation of the brain hormone-producing system. Proctodone has been found in two lepidopterous species-Ostrinia nubilalis and Galleria mellonella. In the O. nubilalis, proctodone plays a part in both photoperiodism and diapause."

https://openalex.org/W1549255095,"Antibody synthesis in response to the injection of diphtheria toxoid into rabbits and rats was used to study the effects of an excess of the amino acid L-phenylalanine on protein synthesis. Injections of phenylalanine produced a marked inhibition of antibody synthesis in both the rat and the rabbit. The dosage of phenylalanine used caused an increase over the normal concentration of phenylalanine in the plasma and spleen of rats, but did not cause a loss of weight or serum protein changes in the treated animals."

After the lesions were induced, daily free water consumption recovered 70 to 80 percent of that of control animals, but there was little, if any, recovery of drinking induced by carbachol."

Findings indicated the existence of an ""F(1) hybrid effect"" for sarcomas and carcinomas, as previously described for lymphomas and normal hematopoietic cells, there being a lower tumor frequency and a longer latency period in the hybrids than in isologous mice."

This leads to the conclusion that uncoupling agents operate by interfering with the synthesis of high-energy intermediates, not by hydrolyzing or otherwise inactivating them."
https://openalex.org/W2056147954,"THE belief that there is increased absorption of iron from a normal diet in idiopathic hæmochromatosis is based on assumptions of normal dietary iron during the time the disease is developing. Studies of iron absorption late in the disease have led to conflicting conclusions1,2. This communication directs attention to wine as a possible source of increased dietary iron in hæmochromatosis."
https://openalex.org/W2100418446,"THE influence of biological factors on the development and viability of eggs of parasitic roundworms (geo-helminths) in soil has not yet been sufficiently explored. It is known that some fungi are able to attack free-living Nemathelminths1–3. It has also been shown that some fungi can attack larvæ of Strongyloides from horses and larvæ of Trichostrongylides from cattle3. Some fungi are also capable of inhibiting the development of eggs of ascarids in vitro4. Gudzhabidze and Preobrazhenskaya5 performed experiments on Ascaris eggs by influencing them with micro-organisms, which had been isolated from the soil specimens from sewage farms. Certain species of actinomycetes and soil bacteria were capable of exerting a depressing effect on the eggs of ascarids."
