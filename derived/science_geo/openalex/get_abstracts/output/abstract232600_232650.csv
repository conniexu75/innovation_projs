https://openalex.org/W1972673502,"Identifying and building a sustainable energy system are perhaps two of the most critical issues that today's society must address. Replacing our current energy carrier mix with a sustainable fuel is one of the key pieces in that system. Hydrogen as an energy carrier, primarily derived from water, can address issues of sustainability, environmental emissions, and energy security. Issues relating to hydrogen production pathways are addressed here. Future energy systems require money and energy to build. Given that the United States has a finite supply of both, hard decisions must be made about the path forward, and this path must be followed with a sustained and focused effort."
https://openalex.org/W2049377387,"A global coupled climate model shows that there is a distinct geographic pattern to future changes in heat waves. Model results for areas of Europe and North America, associated with the severe heat waves in Chicago in 1995 and Paris in 2003, show that future heat waves in these areas will become more intense, more frequent, and longer lasting in the second half of the 21st century. Observations and the model show that present-day heat waves over Europe and North America coincide with a specific atmospheric circulation pattern that is intensified by ongoing increases in greenhouse gases, indicating that it will produce more severe heat waves in those regions in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2106176530,"Humanity already possesses the fundamental scientific, technical, and industrial know-how to solve the carbon and climate problem for the next half-century. A portfolio of technologies now exists to meet the world's energy needs over the next 50 years and limit atmospheric CO 2 to a trajectory that avoids a doubling of the preindustrial concentration. Every element in this portfolio has passed beyond the laboratory bench and demonstration project; many are already implemented somewhere at full industrial scale. Although no element is a credible candidate for doing the entire job (or even half the job) by itself, the portfolio as a whole is large enough that not every element has to be used."

Unlike resistant mutants, cells regrown from such persistent bacteria remain sensitive to the antibiotic. We investigated the persistence of single cells of Escherichia coli with the use of microfluidic devices. Persistence was linked to preexisting heterogeneity in bacterial populations because phenotypic switching occurred between normally growing cells and persister cells having reduced growth rates. Quantitative measurements led to a simple mathematical description of the persistence switch. Inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations may be important in adaptation to fluctuating environments and in the persistence of bacterial infections."
https://openalex.org/W2090921914,"When a crystal deforms plastically, phenomena such as dislocation storage, multiplication, motion, pinning, and nucleation occur over the submicron-to-nanometer scale. Here we report measurements of plastic yielding for single crystals of micrometer-sized dimensions for three different types of metals. We find that within the tests, the overall sample dimensions artificially limit the length scales available for plastic processes. The results show dramatic size effects at surprisingly large sample dimensions. These results emphasize that at the micrometer scale, one must define both the external geometry and internal structure to characterize the strength of a material."
https://openalex.org/W1982836127,"The SOS response aids bacterial propagation by inhibiting cell division during repair of DNA damage. We report that inactivation of the ftsI gene product, penicillin binding protein 3, by either beta-lactam antibiotics or genetic mutation induces SOS in Escherichia coli through the DpiBA two-component signal transduction system. This event, which requires the SOS-promoting recA and lexA genes as well as dpiA, transiently halts bacterial cell division, enabling survival to otherwise lethal antibiotic exposure. Our findings reveal defective cell wall synthesis as an unexpected initiator of the bacterial SOS response, indicate that beta-lactam antibiotics are extracellular stimuli of this response, and demonstrate a novel mechanism for mitigation of antimicrobial lethality."
https://openalex.org/W2004117621,"In the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, formation of the long-lived dauer larva and adult aging are both controlled by insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 signaling. Potentially, increased adult life span in daf-2 insulin/insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor mutants results from mis-expression in the adult of a dauer larva longevity program. By using oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified a dauer transcriptional signature in daf-2 mutant adults. By means of a nonbiased statistical approach, we identified gene classes whose expression is altered similarly in dauers and daf-2 mutants, which represent potential determinants of life span. These include known determinants of longevity; the small heat shock protein/α-crystallins are up-regulated in both milieus. The cytochrome P450, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and glutathione S-transferase (in daf-2 mutants) gene classes were also up-regulated. These four gene classes act together in metabolism and excretion of toxic endobiotic and xenobiotic metabolites. This suggests that diverse toxic lipophilic and electrophilic metabolites, disposed of by phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism, may be the major determinants of the molecular damage that causes aging. In addition, we observed down-regulation of genes linked to nutrient uptake, including nhx-2 and pep-2. These work together in the uptake of dipeptides in the intestine, implying dietary restriction in daf-2 mutants. Some gene groups up-regulated in dauers and/or daf-2 were enriched for certain promoter elements as follows: the daf-16-binding element, the heat shock-response element, the heat shock-associated sequence, or the hif-1-response element. By contrast, the daf-16-associated element was enriched in genes down-regulated in dauers and daf-2 mutants. Thus, particular promoter elements appear longevity-associated or aging associated.

The biological processes that determine adult life span remain largely unknown. Over the last decade, analysis of mutants with altered rates of aging has led to the discovery of many genes and molecular pathways that act as determinants of life span. For example, the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) 1The abbreviations used are: IGF-1, insulin-like growth factor 1; CYP, cytochrome P450; DBE, daf-16-binding element; DAE, daf-16-associated element; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HSE, heat shock element; HRE, hif-1-response element; HSAS, heat shock-associated site; IIS, insulin/IGF-1 signaling; L4, fourth stage larva; SDR, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase; smHSP, small heat shock protein; TRP, transthyretin-related protein; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; SOD, superoxide dismutase; PSSM, position specific score matrix; RBH, reciprocal best BLAST hit; RNAi, RNA interference; SAGE, serial analysis of gene expression; GO, gene ontology; Mt., topomountain. signaling system is a powerful regulator of aging in Caenorhabditis elegans: lowered insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) can lead to more than a doubling of life span (the Age phenotype) (1Friedman D.B. Johnson T.E. Genetics. 1988; 118: 75-86Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudener A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar, 3Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar). Similar effects have been observed in the fruit fly D. melanogaster (4Clancy D. Gems D. Harshman L.G. Oldham S. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Science. 2001; 292: 104-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1143) Google Scholar, 5Tatar M. Kopelman A. Epstein D. Tu M.-P. Yin C.-M. Garofalo R.S. Science. 2001; 292: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (1267) Google Scholar). Recent findings suggest that life span in the mouse is influenced by both insulin and IGF-1 signaling (6Holzenberger M. Dupont J. Ducos B. Leneuve P. Geloen A. Even P. Cervera P. Le Bouc Y. Nature. 2003; 421: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (1640) Google Scholar, 7Bluher M. Kahn B. Kahn C. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of IIS in the control of life span shows evolutionary conservation. However, the life span-determining processes that IIS regulates remain to be identified and are the topic of this report. The IIS system is one of several molecular signal transduction pathways that regulate larval diapause in C. elegans (8Riddle D.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). Under adverse environmental conditions (e.g. high temperature, low food, and high population density) developing larvae can form a long-lived, nonfeeding, and stress-resistant form: the dauer larva (9Cassada R.C. Russell R.L. Dev. Biol. 1975; 46: 326-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). This diapausal form can survive for more than 3 months, during which time it can resume development if dauer-inducing conditions are reversed; by contrast, the adult C. elegans die of old age after only 2–3 weeks (10Klass M.R. Hirsh D.I. Nature. 1976; 260: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Many mutations that reduce IIS result in constitutive dauer larva formation (the Daf-c phenotype), even under nondauer inducing conditions (8Riddle D.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Blumenthal T. Meyer B.J. Priess J.R. Caenorhabditis elegans II. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 739-768Google Scholar). For example, mutations affecting the genes daf-2 (insulin/IGF-1 receptor) (3Kimura K.D. Tissenbaum H.A. Liu Y. Ruvkun G. Science. 1997; 277: 942-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (1742) Google Scholar) and age-1 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) (11Morris J.Z. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1996; 382: 536-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar) have this effect. Potentially, the large increase in life span seen in many IIS mutant adults reflects expression in the adult of dauer-associated longevity assurance processes (2Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudener A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar). A number of observations support this view; for example, dauer larvae and long-lived daf-2 and age-1 mutant adults have increased activity levels of the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) (12Anderson G.L. Can. J. Zool. 1982; 60: 288-291Crossref Google Scholar, 13Vanfleteren J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 14Vanfleteren J.R. De Vreese A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1355-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial Mn-SOD gene sod-3 shows increased mRNA levels in both dauer larvae and daf-2 mutants (15Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 16McElwee J. Bubb K. Thomas J. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Additionally, severe daf-2 mutant adults exhibit a number of dauer-like behavioral characteristics, including cessation of feeding and adoption of an immobile, dauer-like posture (18Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Larson P.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive information about gene expression patterns in dauer larvae and IIS mutant adults has been generated recently by transcriptional profile studies. Differences in mRNA abundance between dauer larvae and mixed stage growing populations have been measured by using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) (19Jones S. Riddle D. Pouzyrev A. Velculescu V. Hillier L. Eddy S. Stricklin S. Baillie D. Waterston R. Marra M. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1346-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). More recently, microarray analysis was used to examine gene expression changes occurring during dauer exit and identified 1,984 genes showing significant expression changes (20Wang J. Kim S. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The increase in adult life span resulting from reduced IIS is suppressed by loss of function of the gene daf-16 (2Kenyon C. Chang J. Gensch E. Rudener A. Tabtiang R. Nature. 1993; 366: 461-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (2523) Google Scholar, 21Dorman J.B. Albinder B. Shroyer T. Kenyon C. Genetics. 1995; 141: 1399-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Larsen P.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1995; 139: 1567-1583Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This gene encodes a FOXO class forkhead transcription factor (23 23Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar, 24Lin K. Dorman J.B. Rodan A. Kenyon C. Science. 1997; 278: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar), and it is therefore likely that the action of genes differentially regulated by DAF-16 is a major determinant of the effects of IIS on aging. Previously, several gene classes were identified that are regulated by IIS in a daf-16-dependent manner. For example, increases have been reported in age-1 and daf-2 mutants of enzyme activity or gene expression levels of antioxidant proteins such as catalase, Cu/Zn-SOD (cytosolic), and Mn-SOD (13Vanfleteren J.R. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 15Honda Y. Honda S. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 1385-1393Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 25Larsen P.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8905-8909Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). Also up-regulated are a number of heat shock proteins (26Walker G. White T. McColl G. Jenkins N. Babich S. Candido E. Johnson T. Lithgow G. J. Gerontol. A Biol. Sci. Med. Sci. 2001; 56: B281-B287Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the heat shock transcription factor (hsf-1) is required for the Age phenotype (27Hsu A. Murphy C. Kenyon C. Science. 2003; 300: 1142-1145Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Genome-wide surveys of transcriptional changes resulting from reduced IIS have been performed by using spotted DNA microarrays (16McElwee J. Bubb K. Thomas J. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). These have led to broad observations of correlations between genes regulated by IIS and particular functional processes or gene groups. An earlier comparison of data from over 500 microarray experiments identified a number of clusters of genes with correlated expression (28Kim S. Lund J. Kiraly M. Duke K. Jiang M. Stuart J. Eizinger A. Wylie B. Davidson G. Science. 2001; 293: 2087-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). These clusters were represented in the form of a three-dimensional topomap, in which co-expressed genes form “topomountains.” Reduced IIS increases expression of many genes associated with topomountain (Mt.) 15, and down-regulation of genes associated with Mts. 8, 19, 27, and 22 (16McElwee J. Bubb K. Thomas J. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Moreover, reduced IIS leads to up-regulation of several functional gene classes (e.g. antibacterial peptides) and down-regulation of others (e.g. vitellogenins) (17Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Although insights have emerged from these studies, interpreting such transcriptional profiles remains difficult. Microarray experiments often generate lists of genes that are difficult to interpret in an unbiased fashion. Given a long enough list of differentially expressed genes, proof may be found for whatever theory is cherished by the investigator or fashionable in the research community. To circumvent this problem, we have taken a novel approach. We make the following assumptions. (a) Some common mechanisms increase life span in dauer larvae and daf-2 mutant adults. (b) These shared mechanisms are reflected by common changes in gene transcription. We have compared previously reported expression profiles of genes altered during dauer exit (20Wang J. Kim S. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) with profiles for genes regulated by daf-2 in a daf-16-dependent manner, newly generated using whole genome oligonucleotide microarray analysis. We find that transcriptional changes occurring in dauer larvae are partially recapitulated in long-lived daf-2 adults. By using a nonbiased statistical analysis, we have identified a number of gene categories that are significantly enriched for members with altered expression in both dauer and daf-2 adult animals. This provides information about dauer-specific processes, which are mis-expressed in long-lived daf-2 mutant adults and potentially control longevity and aging. We also identify several promoter elements that are enriched among dauer- and daf-2-regulated genes. Strains and Media—The following strains were used for strain constructions: SS104 glp-4(bn2ts) I (29Beanan M. Strome S. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar); DR1563 daf-2(e1370) III; DR1567 daf-2(m577) III (18Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Larson P.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); and GR1307 daf-16(mgDf50) I (23 23Ogg S. Paradis S. Gottlieb S. Patterson G.I. Lee L. Tissenbaum H.A. Ruvkun G. Nature. 1997; 389: 994-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (1551) Google Scholar). From these, the following strains were constructed by standard means: glp-4 I; daf-2(m577) III, glp-4 daf-16; daf-2(m577), glp-4; daf-2(e1370), and glp-4 daf-16; daf-2(e1370). glp-4 is included in all strains to prevent egg and progeny production, thereby limiting mRNA analysis to that of somatic adult tissues. For routine strain maintenance, strain constructions, and life span analysis, nematodes were maintained on NGM agar plates, and Escherichia coli strain OP50 was used as a food source for all aspects of this study (30Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). For preparation of large numbers of nematodes for RNA isolation, 9-cm diameter enriched peptone NGM plates were used to maximize growth (31Lewis J. Fleming J. Epstein H. Shakes D. Caenorhabditis elegans: Modern Biological Analysis of an Organism. 48. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 4-29Google Scholar). Analysis of Life Span—For life span analysis, animals were raised at 15 °C and transferred to 25 °C at L4 stage. Life span of populations was measured on NGM plates as described previously (18Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Larson P.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Kaplan Meier analysis was conducted on survival data, and survival of populations of different genotypes were compared by using the nonparametric log rank test, using the statistical analysis package JMP 3.2.2 (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC). Isolation of RNA for Microarray Analysis—Nematodes were prepared for RNA extraction as follows. Eggs from each strain were first isolated from three large (9 cm) plates of just-starved, mixed-stage populations by alkaline hypochlorite treatment (30Sulston J. Hodgkin J. Wood W.B. The Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 587-606Google Scholar). These were allowed to hatch overnight in 50 ml of S media in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 20 °C with rotary shaking (200 rpm). The resulting synchronized L1 larvae were concentrated by centrifugation, pipetted onto eight large plates (subsequently pooled to give one biological replicate), and incubated at 15 °C. When most animals had reached L4 stage, plates were shifted up to 25 °C. This temperature shift at L4 served a dual purpose; it prevented dauer formation in the daf-16(+) strains (which are past the developmental point at which they can form dauers), and it ensured sterility in all strains (via glp-4). Worms were harvested for RNA extraction the following day (1-day-old sterile adults), by washing worms off plates with M9, followed by three additional washes with ice-cold M9 to remove residual bacteria. At the time of harvesting, cultures were sampled to check for the presence of dauer larvae, males, and carcasses, which might still remain from the hypochlorite treatment. Details of this and other aspects of this work are available at AgeBase (haldane.biol.ucl.ac.uk/publications.html). Whereas no dauer larvae were seen in daf-16(0) strains, a very small number were seen in one of the daf-16(+) samples. Small numbers of males and non-dauer larvae were observed in some samples to varying degrees; however, we did not observe any systematic contamination of particular sample genotypes. We did not observe any carcasses remaining from hypochlorite treatment in any samples. Finally, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), followed by purification and concentration using RNEasy columns according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, www1.qiagen.com). The quality of RNA samples was confirmed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, www.chem.agilent.com). Oligonucleotide Microarray Analysis—Changes in transcript abundance was measured using C. elegans whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays (Affymetrix). We performed five biological replicates of each genotype. All Affymetrix protocols were performed at the University College London Institute of Child Health Gene Microarray Centre. The cRNA probe was generated by using standard Affymetrix protocols (www.affymetrix.com). Fragmented biotinylated probe was then hybridized to C. elegans whole genome arrays. Washing, labeling (streptavidin-phycoerythrin), and scanning followed standard procedures at the Institute of Child Health Gene Microarray Centre. Statistical Analysis—To calculate gene expression measures, the data sets were normalized as follows. Raw image files were converted to probe set data (.cel files) in Microarray Suite (MAS 5.0) (32.Deleted in proofGoogle Scholar) (www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/terry/zarray/Affy/GL_Workshop/genelogic2001.html). The 20 probe set data files were normalized together, and expression values were determined, using the Robust Multichip Average method (33Irizarry R. Hobbs B. Collin F. Beazer-Barclay Y. Antonellis K. Scherf U. Speed T. Biostatistics. 2003; 4: 249-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (8516) Google Scholar), implemented in the Affymetrix package (version 1.4.14) of the free statistical programming language R (www.r-project.org). Full array gene expression measures are available on the Gene Expression Omnibus (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo), accession numbers GSM28389–GSM28408. To identify differential gene expression between genotypes, we used significance analysis of microarrays, implemented in Microsoft Excel. A Δ value of 0.819 was chosen, which called 2,274 significant probe sets (1,348 up-regulated, 926 down-regulated), with a median false discovery rate of 5.06% (median number of falsely called probe sets = 116). To create the list of genes differentially regulated during dauer recovery, we re-analyzed the raw data from a previous study (20Wang J. Kim S. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Expression differences between time 0 and 12 h after dauer recovery were used to identify probes that were differentially expressed. Additionally, we calculated a new t test value for all gene changes, using a more stringent two-tailed Student's t test and assuming unequal variance. We then selected probes that showed at least a 2-fold (up or down) difference in expression and had a p value of <0.005. This resulted in a list of 2,535 differentially regulated genes (1,160 up-regulated, 1,375 down-regulated). To ensure the reliability of our data, we also performed several quality control procedures for both microarray formats. Briefly, we verified the accuracy of the microarray probes, and we identified probes that are predicted to hybridize to more than one gene (promiscuous probes) or to no gene (orphan probes). (For full analysis, see haldane.biol.ucl.ac.uk). Probes that could unambiguously be assigned to a single gene were used for EASE analysis (see below), whereas promiscuous probes were analyzed by hand for any potential functional significance. EASE Analysis—For our EASE analysis (see “Results” for explanation of the EASE application), we annotated every probe set on the C. elegans Affymetrix microarray and the Stanford cDNA microarray using information from a number of different data bases and data sets. We first associated each oligonucleotide probe set (or spotted array DNA probe) with its corresponding current curated gene entry. Next, the gene entry of each probe set was used to annotate the probe set or cDNA probe with functional information from Gene Ontology (GO) (34Ashburner M. Ball C.A. Blake J.A. Botstein D. Butler H.

Analysis of Promoter Sequences—Genes with a given gene promoter motif in a defined region were identified using the program DNA Motif Searcher. This program uses a set of user-supplied DNA sequence motifs to search for additional motif instances in the genome of C. elegans. The set of motifs supplied by the user are interpreted into a position-specific score matrix (PSSM) that is used in the search step. By using this PSSM, the program can then identify the closest matching occurrences of the motif based on either a score cut-off, or it can identify the top X number of occurrences of the motif. For download or for a detailed explanation of how DNA Motif Searcher works, please see calliope.gs.washington.edu/papers/mcelwee2004a/software.html. For the analyses presented here, we identified the top 10,000 occurrences of each motif using local background nucleotide frequencies and then filtered the hits to identify genes that contained motif occurrences within 1,000 bp upstream of the translational start site and/or within intron 1. The PSSM for each search were derived from DBE (37Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar), DAE (17Murphy C.T.

Analysis of Frequency of Drosophila Orthologues in Topomountains— Fly gene orthologues were identified by using an all-versus-all BLAST search for both worm and fly using a cut-off value of 1 × 10–8. These results from these searches were then used to identify reciprocal best BLAST hits using RBH Assigner (calliope.gs.washington.edu/papers/mcelwee2004a/software.html). The resulting list of RBHs were used for this analysis, using a score cut-off of 100.0 or greater (2,623 of 3,609 RBHs). By using this list of RBHs, the fly orthologues were placed into orthologous mountains. The total number of C. elegans genes in each mountain was calculated, and the percent representation was determined as the fraction of fly genes found in the orthologous mountain. Genes that are transcriptionally regulated by the DAF-16 transcription factor must include some that are direct determinants of life span. DAF-16-regulated genes have been identified by using DNA microarray analysis (spotted arrays) (16McElwee J. Bubb K. Thomas J. Aging Cell. 2003; 2: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 17Murphy C.T. McCarroll S.A. Bargmann C.I. Fraser A. Kamath R.S. Ahringer J. Li H. Kenyon C.J. Nature. 2003; 424: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar). Here we have taken the approach of comparing lists of genes whose expression is altered in daf-2 mutants and in dauer larvae, performing a nonbiased search for classes of genes that are enriched in both cases. To this end we prepared a new list of daf-16-regulated genes, using whole genome oligonucleotide (Affymetrix) arrays. The dauer-regulated gene list was derived from a previous study (20Wang J. Kim S. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 1621-1634Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). daf-2 mutants are all long-lived but show variable degrees of pleiotropy (18Gems D. Sutton A.J. Sundermeyer M.L. Larson P.L. Albert P.S. King K.V. Edgley M. Riddle D.L. Genetics. 1998; 150: 129-155Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To reduce the probability of identifying allele-specific targets unlinked to aging, we used two daf-2 alleles for the microarray analysis: daf-2(m577) (class 1) and daf-2(e1370) (class 2, more pleiotropic). We studied age-synchronized 1-dayold adults, in which reproduction was blocked using the glp-4(bn2ts) mutation (29Beanan M. Strome S. Development (Camb.). 1992; 116: 755-766PubMed Google Scholar). This temperature-sensitive mutation blocks mitotic proliferation of the germ line at 25 °C but is fertile at 15 °C. Nematodes were shifted from 15 to 25 °C at the L4 stage. In C. elegans, an increase in life span results from removal of the germ line, whether"
https://openalex.org/W2029870060,"Studies of carbohydrates have been hampered by the lack of chemical strategies for the expeditious construction and coupling of differentially protected monosaccharides. Here, a synthetic route based on aldol coupling of three aldehydes is presented for the de novo production of polyol differentiated hexoses in only two chemical steps. The dimerization of alpha-oxyaldehydes, catalyzed by l-proline, is then followed by a tandem Mukaiyama aldol addition-cyclization step catalyzed by a Lewis acid. Differentially protected glucose, allose, and mannose stereoisomers can each be selected, in high yield and stereochemical purity, simply by changing the solvent and Lewis acid used. The reaction sequence also efficiently produces (13)C-labeled analogs, as well as structural variants such as 2-amino- and 2-thio-substituted derivatives."
https://openalex.org/W1988286342,"We describe synthetic membranes in which the molecular recognition chemistry used to accomplish selective permeation is DNA hybridization. These membranes contain template-synthesized gold nanotubes with inside diameters of 12 nanometers, and a “transporter” DNA-hairpin molecule is attached to the inside walls of these nanotubes. These DNA-functionalized nanotube membranes selectively recognize and transport the DNA strand that is complementary to the transporter strand, relative to DNA strands that are not complementary to the transporter. Under optimal conditions, single-base mismatch transport selectivity can be obtained."
https://openalex.org/W2055636600,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1) phosphorylates sphingosine to generate sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Because both substrate and product of the enzyme are potentially important signaling molecules, the regulation of SK1 is of considerable interest. We report that SK1, which is ordinarily a cytosolic enzyme, translocates in vivo and in vitro to membrane compartments enriched in phosphatidic acid (PA), the lipid product of phospholipase D. This translocation depends on direct interaction of SK1 with PA, because recombinant purified enzyme shows strong affinity for pure PA coupled to Affi-Gel. The SK1-PA interaction maps to the C terminus of SK1 and is independent of catalytic activity or of the diacylglycerol kinase-like domain of the enzyme.

Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Ganley I. Sugars J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 94-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas many cellular control pathways exhibit a stimulus-dependent elevation of PLD activity (arguing for a direct role of the lipid product of PLD-PA in these pathways (2Exton J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1439: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar)), historically, the search for classic protein effectors of PA has failed to yield many clear-cut examples where a specific response to elevated PA levels could be demonstrated directly. Recent data from a number of laboratories are beginning to define some potential PA targets. These include kinases (e.g. Raf-1 (3Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7736-7743Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar)), as well as other enzymes (e.g. phosphodiesterase PDE4D3 (11Grange M. Sette C. Cuomo M. Conti M. Lagarde M. Prigent A.

There are additional examples of proteins regulated by PA in combination with other lipids (e.g. protein kinase Cϵ (13Jose Lopez-Andreo M. Gomez-Fernandez J. Corbalan-Garcia S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and p47phox (14Karathanassis D. Stahelin R. Bravo J. Perisic O. Pacold C. Cho W. Williams R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5057-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)). With the possible exception of Raf-1 and PKCϵ, regulation of the other proteins by PA has not been shown to result directly in membrane translocation in vivo. Raf-1 accumulates in endosomal membranes as a consequence of PA formation (4Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23911-23918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), whereas PKCϵ translocates to the plasma membrane in response to coordinated production of PA and diacylglycerol (13Jose Lopez-Andreo M. Gomez-Fernandez J. Corbalan-Garcia S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By phosphorylating sphingosine to generate S1P, SK1 regulates the levels of two important bioactive lipids and affects a number of cellular functions, including for example calcium mobilization, growth control, and cytoskeletal rearrangements among others (for a recent review see Ref. 15Spiegel S. Milstien S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25851-25854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). We became interested in the possibility that SK1 may constitute a novel PA effector based on three types of evidence. SK1 activity is stimulated by acidic phospholipids, including PA (16Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it is found up-regulated in immune cells following PLD activation (reviewed in Ref. 17Melendez A. Allen J. Semin Immunol. 2002; 14: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and the SK1 protein is activated by PKC (a PLD activator) and translocates to membranes following stimulation with phorbol esters (18Johnson K. Becker K. Facchinetti M. Hannun Y. Obeid L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35257-35262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In this work we show that SK1 is a PA effector and responds to PA formation by translocating to membranes in a manner analogous to other effectors of signaling lipids, most notably of the phosphoinositides. We propose that membrane translocation of SK1 is a direct consequence of the acute and localized formation of PA. This finding adds support to the idea that PA is a signaling lipid and provides novel avenues of investigation concerning the cellular functions of SK1. Plasmids—The wild type and the G81D catalytically dead (KD) mouse SK1 were cloned in pcDNA4/myc-His (Invitrogen). These and the N- and C-terminal SK1 fragments (residues 1–169 and 134–388, respectively) were also sub-cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) using appropriate primers and standard techniques. PLD1 was cloned in the pCMV3 vector as described previously (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The following antibodies were used in immunofluorescence and immunoblots: mouse monoclonal 9E10 against the myc epitope (prepared at Babraham); mouse monoclonal 6G5 against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Biogenesis); rabbit polyclonals raised against N- and C-terminal peptides of PLD (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal to phospholipase Cδ, a kind gift of Drs. Matilda Katan and Matthew Jones (Institute of Cancer Research, London); rabbit polyclonal against GFP (Molecular Probes); rabbit polyclonal against the medial Golgi marker mannosidase II (Dr. Kelley Moremen, University of Georgia); mouse monoclonal against early endosome antigen 1 (EEA1, BD Transduction Laboratories). Secondary fluorescein-, rhodamine-, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories. Biotin dextran was detected with Cy3-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). SPE7 IgE antibodies against DNP used to prime RBL-2H3 cells were from Sigma. Cell Culture—COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). CHOtet cells were maintained in nutrient mixture F-12 (Ham's) with l-glutamine (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. Cells were stably transfected with PLD1 using the Tet-on system (Stratagene) and were a kind of gift of Dr. Michael Frohman (State University of New York, Stony Brook, NY). PLD expression was induced by incubation with 1 μm doxycycline in normal medium for 18 h prior to analysis. RBL-2H3 cells were a kind gift of Dr. Shamshad Cockcroft (University College London, London, UK) and were grown in DMEM and 10% heat-inactivated (56 °C for 32 min) in fetal bovine serum and 2 mm glutamine. All cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C in 5% CO2 and grown on Nunc plastic ware or on glass coverslips for immunofluorescence. COS-7 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran as described before (19Manifava M. Sugars J. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1072-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All other cells were transfected by electroporation. Microscopy—Cells for immunofluorescence were grown on glass coverslips and fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in 200 mm Hepes, pH 7.0. They were permeabilized in 0.25% Nonidet P-40 in NET gel (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% gelatin, and 0.02% sodium azide) and blocked with NET gel. Cells were stained with the appropriate primary and secondary antibodies in NET gel, and coverslips were mounted on a drop of Aqua Poly Mount (Polysciences Inc.). Samples were visualized with a Zeiss Axiophot 2 fluorescence microscope using a ×60 oil immersion lens or a ×40 lens. Photographs were taken with a SPOT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments Inc.) and supplied software. Translocation of SK1 to Membrane Fractions in Vitro—CHO-K1 light membranes were isolated from a 0.8–1.2 m sucrose interface as described before (20Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4952-4956Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). COS-7 cytosol from cells transfected with SK1 was prepared as described (21Ktistakis N.T. Brown H.A. Waters M.G. Sternweis P.C. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar) and was diluted 1/25 in COS-7 cytosol from untransfected cells so that the signal from the input fraction would fall within the linear range of the ECL detection. This cytosol mixture was pre-cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 5 min to remove any insoluble protein and was used in the assay. For a binding assay, membranes were diluted 1/5 in Buffer B (25 mm KCl, 2.5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 m sucrose, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.2) and added to the cytosol mixture into siliconized microcentrifuge tubes. The ratio of cytosol to membranes was ∼1:7 in a total volume of 200 μl. In addition to membranes and cytosol, binding reactions contained 1 mm EGTA, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 2.5 units of Streptomyces chromofuscus (Sigma catalogue number P8023) or Streptomyces sp. (Sigma catalogue number P4912) PLD as indicated. The samples were mixed gently and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. At the end of incubation the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was carefully aspirated, and the membrane pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of Laemmli sample buffer for analysis by SDS-PAGE. Measurement of SK1 Activity—Light membranes from CHO cells not expressing myc-SK1 were incubated with cytosol from COS cells expressing myc-tagged SK1 in the presence of calcium, PLD, or calcium/PLD as required and harvested by centrifugation. Membranes were resuspended in SK assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm 4-deoxypyridoxine, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean trypsin inhibitor) to ∼0.6 mg of protein/ml. Aliquots of membranes were added to glass vials in which sphingosine (0 or 10 nmol) and phosphatidylserine (50 nmol) was presented as mixed micelles using Triton X-100 (final concentration 0.063%). Reactions were initiated by the addition of ATP (1 μCi, 40Ci/mmol) in 10 mm MgCl2 and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Resulting [32P]S1P was extracted using butanol, which was washed twice using 2 m KCl before quantification of radioactivity. Analysis of the radioactive butanol-soluble material by TLC confirmed the presence of a single product, which co-migrated with an S1P standard. Binding of SK1 to Lipid-coupled Beads—These experiments were done essentially as described before (22Manifava M. Thuring J.W.J.F. Lim Z.Y. Packman L. Holmes A.B. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8987-8994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) using lipid-coupled beads whose detailed synthesis has recently been described (23Lim Z. Thuring J. Holmes A. Manifava M. Ktistakis N. J. Chem. Soc. Perkin Trans. 1. 2002; 2002: 1067-1075Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the appropriate constructs were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 0.6 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g to remove debris. The supernatant, with ∼500–600 μg/ml protein, was collected and diluted 1:1 in lysis buffer to give the lysate. 380 μl of lysate was incubated with 30 μl of a 10% (v/v) suspension of PA beads in IP buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40) in a 500-μl microcentrifuge tube on ice. A few air bubbles were included to facilitate mixing of the beads. The tubes were put in a rotator at 4 °C for 2 h. At the end of binding, beads were quickly washed three times with IP buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. For experiments using soluble lipid as competitor during the binding reaction, lipids in chloroform were dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended by sonication in lysis buffer. The appropriate amount was added to the cleared COS-7 lysates for 15 min on ice before addition of lipid-coupled beads. Binding of SK1 to Liposomes—Lipid stocks were kept at 10 mg/ml in chloroform. To produce 1 ml of liposomes, 32 μl of PC, 32 μl of phosphatidylethanolamine, and 10 μl of phosphatidylserine were mixed, dried under a stream of nitrogen, and incubated with 1 ml of HK buffer (40 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2) for 4 h at 4 °C. At the end of this incubation liposomes were produced by vortexing for 3 min. Each binding reaction contained 120 μl of liposomes, the indicated units of bacterial PLD, plus SK1 either purified or as part of a cytosolic fraction, to give a total volume of 150 μl. Binding was allowed at 30 °C for 15 min followed by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge and careful aspiration of the supernatant. To measure PC hydrolysis in this system, 0.5 μCi of [14C]PC was included in the lipid mixture before drying. At the end of the binding reaction, lipids were extracted with methanol:chloroform essentially according to Bligh and Dyer (see Ref. 24Bi K. Roth M.G. Ktistakis N.T. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 301-307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Lipids were dried, resuspended in 30 μl of chloroform, loaded onto TLC plates (Whatman LK6DF silica gel 60A, 250 μm), and separated in a solvent system containing chloroform:methanol:acetic acid:acetone:water (10:2:2:4:1). Microinjections with Bacterial PLD—COS cells were transiently transfected with the appropriate GFP construct and seeded onto glass coverslips or on glass bottomed dishes (World Precision Instruments) for 40 h. 3 units/μl Streptomyces sp. PLD with 2 mg/ml biotin dextran (Mr 3000, Molecular Probes) were microinjected using an Eppendorf Tranjector coupled to a micromanipulator. For immunofluorescence, 100–150 cells on each coverslip were microinjected over a period of 15 min in a temperature- and CO2-controlled chamber, fixed, and stained with Streptavidin-Cy3. For live imaging, two or three cells were microinjected and imaged at 15- or 30-s intervals for 10–20 min. Imaging was carried out with a Zeiss Axiocam camera and Axiovision software. In all imaging experiments, a subset of cells was microinjected with vehicle alone plus dextran. This treatment did not have any effects on the movement of SK1. Measurement of PLD Activity in Vivo—RBL-2H3 cells were labeled and stimulated as follows. [3H]Palmitate in ethanol was dried under a stream of nitrogen and resuspended in dialyzed serum. Cells to be labeled were washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated for 16 h in DMEM containing 10% dialyzed serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 60 μCi/ml palmitate. 25 ng/ml anti-DNP IgE was included to sensitize the FcϵRI. Subsequently, medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing 10% serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and, as indicated, 25 μg/ml DNP conjugated with bovine serum albumin and 1% butanol. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, lipids were extracted and resolved as described above. Plates were then dried, sprayed with EN3HANCE (DuPont), and exposed to film at -80 °C. Expression of SK1 in RBL-2H3 Cells—RBL-2H3 cells were transfected with 30 μg of pEGFP-C2-SK1 by electroporation using 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) at 0.27 V and 960 microfarads with a time constant approaching 30 ms (Bio-Rad GenePulser™). Cells were seeded on glass coverslips to be ∼70% confluent after 24 h. After 8 h cells were primed by the addition of fresh medium containing 25 ng/ml DNP IgE for 16 h to sensitize the FcϵRI. Cells were stimulated by the addition of fresh medium containing 25 μg/ml DNP-bovine serum albumin for 30 min and then fixed and stained with antibodies to myc. For experiments done in the presence of alcohols, medium containing either butanol or sec-butanol was used during the 30-min stimulation. Reproducibility of Data—All data shown have been reproduced at least three times. Experiments with SK1 activity and microinjections were done such that the person measuring activity or microinjecting cells did not know the identity of the samples until after the experiment was finished. Co-localization of SK1 with PLD1—Co-expression of SK1 with PLD1 under basal conditions resulted in some co-localization of the two proteins, primarily on perinuclear vesicular structures (Fig. 1A). This was consistent with the possibility that SK1 becomes enriched in membranes containing increased amounts of PA as a result of PLD1 overexpression. To examine this possibility further we expressed SK1 in CHO cells that were designed to overexpress PLD1 inducibly (Fig. 1B). Without PLD1 expression, SK1 was localized mainly in the cytosol and in some perinuclear regions (Fig. 1B, upper three panels). Upon PLD1 induction followed by stimulation with phorbol ester (i.e. under conditions of maximal PLD1-derived PA formation), SK1 accumulated in a perinuclear region that co-localized very well with PLD1 (Fig. 1B, lower three panels). In addition to the perinuclear accumulation, some SK1 also became enriched on the plasma membrane. In another set of experiments we examined the relative contributions of PLD1 induction and phorbol ester stimulation on the perinuclear accumulation of SK1 (Fig. 2A). Maximal SK1 translocation required both PLD1 induction and phorbol ester stimulation, although we frequently saw perinuclear accumulation of SK1 only with PLD1 induction or with phorbol ester stimulation (Fig. 2B). Further experiments determined that the perinuclear locus of SK1 co-localized partially both with the endosomal protein EEA1 and with the Golgi mannosidase 2 (data not shown). Finally, by co-immunoprecipitation experiments under a variety of conditions we obtained no evidence that SK1 and PLD1 interact directly (data not shown).Fig. 2Translocation of SK1 to perinuclear membranes after PLD1 activation. A, CHO cells expressing PLD1 inducibly were transiently transfected with myc-tagged SK1 and treated in various ways. In one set, cells were induced for PLD1 expression for 18 h followed by 30-min stimulation with 200 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (+P+I). In the other three sets, induction (I) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment (P) were varied as indicated. At the end of treatments, cells were fixed and stained for SK1 using anti-myc antibodies. B, cells from three independent experiments as shown in A were counted to provide an estimate of the extent of perinuclear accumulation of SK1 following various treatments. On average, 300 transfected cells were counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) SK1 Translocates to PA-enriched Membranes and Is Enzymatically Active—To test directly the idea that SK1 binds to PA-enriched membranes we established an in vitro system. COS cells were transfected with plasmids expressing myc-tagged SK1, and a membrane-free cytosolic fraction was isolated. At the same time, a cytosol-free light membrane fraction was isolated from CHO cells that did not express myc-tagged SK1. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were then mixed in the presence of various added components at 37 °C, and the membranes were re-isolated by centrifugation and analyzed for SK1 binding by SDS-PAGE and immunoblots (Fig. 3A). To generate high levels of PA on the membranes, we used purified bacterial PLD from S. chromofuscus, an enzyme that hydrolyzes PC to generate PA in the presence of micromolar amounts of calcium (25Yamamoto I. Konto A. Handa T. Miyajima K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Simple addition of SK1 cytosol to membranes resulted in minimal translocation (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Similarly, the levels of SK1 found on membranes under most conditions of varying calcium and ATP were low. However, a very dramatic enhancement in the amount of translocated SK1 was obtained under conditions of maximal PLD activity (Fig. 3A, lanes 7 and 8). Without membranes, only a small amount of SK1 was found in the pellet fraction under fully activated conditions (Fig. 3A, lane 9). We then asked whether the SK1 that translocated to membranes under these conditions was still enzymatically active. At the end of a scaled-up binding experiment, the membranes were re-isolated without detergent and were assayed for SK1 activity (Fig. 3B). We found that SK1 translocation as shown by immunoblots of the same experiment (Fig. 3B, inset) was accompanied by an 8- to 10-fold increase in SK1 activity. We note that the -fold translocation of the protein paralleled the -fold increase in catalytic activity (both ∼6- to 8-fold), suggesting that PA probably influences this pathway only at the level of membrane translocation. Selective Binding of SK1 to Pure PA—Translocation of SK1 to PA enriched membranes as shown above could be indirect. To examine this possibility we assayed binding of recombinant SK1 to various lipids coupled covalently to Affi-Gel. These reagents have proven extremely useful in identification and characterization of various lipid binding proteins (22Manifava M. Thuring J.W.J.F. Lim Z.Y. Packman L. Holmes A.B. Ktistakis N.T. J.

Cell. 2002; 9: 95-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Incubation of COS cell lysates enriched for SK1 with a variety of lipid-coupled beads showed specific binding of SK1 to PA (Fig. 4A). Of all the other lipids tested, only phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate showed weak (less than a tenth of that seen for PA) binding. To examine the possibility that binding to PA involved the kinase activity of SK1, we repeated the binding experiment but using a catalytically compromised mutant of SK1 (Fig. 4B). For both wild type and mutant SK1, we saw strong and equivalent binding to PA and weaker binding to phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. To provide evidence for the specificity of the SK1-PA interaction, we carried out additional binding experiments to PA-coupled beads in the presence of various competitor lipids. Preincubation of SK1 lysates with increasing amounts of soluble PA (either dioctanoyl, C:8 or dipalmitoyl, C:16, which is the same species used for coupling) reduced significantly binding of SK1 to the PA-coupled beads (Fig. 4C). As we have reported before, the shorter chain analogue of PA was more effective for competition (22Manifava M. Thuring J.W.J.F. Lim Z.Y. Packman L. Holmes A.B. Ktistakis N.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8987-8994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Significantly, neither soluble sphingosine (the substrate of SK1) nor soluble phosphatidylserine (an acidic phospholipid capable of activating SK1 in vitro (16Olivera A. Rosenthal J. Spiegel S. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar)) were able to compete for the binding of SK1 to PA (Fig. 4D). The above data establish that SK1 has specific affinity for PA but do not rule out the possibility that this affinity is indirect, perhaps via an associated protein. To examine this possibility we purified recombinant SK1 from COS cells transfected with plasmids encoding myc- and His-tagged SK1. In this preparation, SK1 was the major protein as shown by Coomassie staining (data not shown). Using this highly enriched SK1 sample, we showed that binding to immobilized PA was still strong (Fig. 5A), at the expense of some additional bands that co-purify with the protein but were much reduced from the PA-enriched fraction (Fig. 5A, bands marked with asterisks). We then examined binding of recombinant purified SK1 to pure liposomes that were enriched for PA by incubation with bacterial PLD. For these experiments we used a preparation of Streptomyces sp. PLD that does not require calcium for activity (see also Fig. 7D) to avoid potential artifacts caused by calcium during liposome preparation. Translocation of SK1 to these defined liposomes was dependent on active PLD (Fig. 5B), and it occurred at the same concentration range of the enzyme that gave measurable PA formation (Fig. 5C). We have done additional experiments varying the base composition of liposomes (including ones made with PC only) but have never obtained translocation of SK1 that was not dependent on PLD activity. In addition, SK1 present in a cytosolic fraction translocated to the PLD-treated liposomes with similar efficiency as the purified protein, indicating that the SK1-PA interaction is direct (data not shown).Fig. 7Membrane translocation of SK1 in cells microinjected with PLD. A, COS cells expressing GFP-tagged SK1 were microinjected with a solution of bacterial PLD (Streptomyces sp.) containing biotinylated dextran. After recovery at 37 °C for 15 min, the cells were fixed and stained with avidin-Cy3 to mark the microinjected cells. Notice that PLD microinjection induces translocation of SK1 from the cytosol to perinuclear membranes. B, similar experiment as in A, but cells were expressing either GFP alone or GFP-tagged SK1 fragments as shown in Fig. 5. Notice that only the GFP-tagged C-terminal fragment of SK1 responds to PLD microinjection. C, PLD-induced SK1 translocation is time-dependent. The microinjected cell was observed by live imaging for 15 min. Two images immediately after microinjection and 7 min later are shown. D, translocation of SK1 to PLD-treated membranes showing that, unlike the S. chromofuscus PLD, the Streptomyces sp. PLD does not require calcium to induce translocation. This enzyme was used in all microinjections. Conditions for this binding experiment are as shown in Fig. 3A.View Large Image Fig"

The factors and signaling events that control the maintenance of the undifferentiated state are not well characterized and their identification is of major importance. Based on the data from global expression analyses, we set out to identify genes and the signaling pathways controlling them that are regulated in the early phase of the differentiation process. This study shows that nodal and the inhibitors of Nodal signaling, lefty-A and lefty-B, are down-regulated very early upon differentiation. High expression of these genes in undifferentiated cells is maintained by activation of the transcription factor Smad2/3, downstream of the activin-linked kinases (ALK) 4/5/7. Treatment of differentiating cells with Activin A leads to activation of Smad2/3 and expression of nodal, lefty-A and lefty-B, while inhibition of ALK4/5/7 by the kinase inhibitor SB-431542 blocks activation of Smad2/3 and expression of these genes in the undifferentiated state. In addition, when cells are maintained undifferentiated by treatment with the GSK3-inhibitor, BIO, high expression of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B also requires activation of ALK4/5/7. Conversely, BMP signaling leading to Smad1/5/8 activation via ALK2/3/6 is blocked in undifferentiated cells and becomes activated upon differentiation. Taken together, these observations establish that Smad2/3 is activated in undifferentiated hESCs and required for the expression of genes controlling Nodal signaling.

Over the last decade the study of mammalian embryonic stem cells, especially mouse ESCs, has provided valuable insights into early embryogenesis in mammals. More recently, researchers have started to analyze human ESCs (hESCs) allowing a glimpse into early human embryogenesis and the development of tools for regenerative medicine. While our understanding of the basic biology of mouse ESCs (mESCs) and their in vivo properties is quite advanced, we know very little about the biological properties of hESC. Studying human cells is of special importance since recent molecular studies have shown that their properties differ from mouse cells (1Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar, 2Reubinoff B.E. Pera M.F. Fong C.Y. Trounson A. Bongso A. Nat.

These findings are not unexpected given the differences in early embryonic development between mice and humans (4Ko M.S. Trends Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 511-518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).One of the foremost questions in the study of hESCs is the identification of factors required for maintenance of the undifferentiated state. hESCs, unlike mESCs (reviewed in Ref. 3Smith A.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar), cannot be maintained undifferentiated with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF, Refs. 1Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar and 2Reubinoff B.E. Pera M.F. Fong C.Y. Trounson A. Bongso A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 399-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2284) Google Scholar). However, both human and mouse ESCs stay undifferentiated on feeder layers of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) or in the presence of MEF-conditioned medium (CM), suggesting that MEFs produce soluble factors that are sufficient to promote the undifferentiated state. Embryonic stem cells have the potential to differentiate into cell types of all different lineages, i.e. ecto-, endo-, and mesodermal and extra-embryonic and germ cell lineages (reviewed in Ref. 3Smith A.G. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Complex signaling networks control these differentiation processes in vivo (reviewed in Ref. 5Loebel D.A. Watson C.M. De Young R.A. Tam P.P. Dev. Biol. 2003; 264: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar).A recent study reported global transcriptional profiling in which the entire repertoire of transcripts in mouse (6Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar) and hESCs, grown both under pluripotent and differentiating conditions were compared (7Sato N. Sanjuan I.M. Heke M. Uchida M. Naef F. Brivanlou A.H. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Interestingly, 24% overlap was observed between the two sets. The genes that are down-regulated in both mouse and human ESCs, include members of the transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling pathway, such as the teratoma-derived growth factor-1 (TDGF-1/Cripto), which is an EGF-CFC co-receptor for Nodal signaling, as well as lefty-A (EBAF, lefty2 in the mouse) and lefty-B (lefty1 in the mouse), which are inhibitors of Nodal signaling. It has also been shown that nodal itself is highly expressed in undifferentiated hESCs and mESCs (6Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar, 8Rosler E.S. Fisk G.J. Ares X. Irving J. Miura T. Rao M.S. Carpenter M.K. Dev.

Cells. 2004; 22: 292-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).TGFβ signaling is involved in a variety of cell fate decisions in early embryogenesis (reviewed in Ref. 10Harland R. Gerhart J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 611-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). The TGFβ superfamily of ligands signals through two main branches: the BMP branch activates Activin-linked kinases (ALK) 2/3/6 (TGFβ type I receptors), leading to the phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factors Smad1/5/8. The Activin/Nodal branch involves the activation of the type I receptors ALK4/5/7 and subsequent phosphorylation and activation of the effectors Smad2/3. Smad7 inhibits both branches of TGFβ signaling and provides a repressive input on these pathways (reviewed in Ref. 11Shi Y. Massague J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4737) Google Scholar).Activation of Smad2 downstream of Nodal signaling is involved in several processes in the development of the embryo. Nodal induces mesoderm and endoderm, patterns the nervous system, and determines left-right asymmetry in vertebrates (reviewed in Ref. 12Schier A.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 589-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Lefty1 blocks Nodal signaling by a dual mechanism, it binds Nodal directly and also binds EGF-CFC co-receptors, such as TDGF-1/Cripto, thus preventing the assembly of an active Nodal/Activin receptor complex (13Chen C. Shen M.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 618-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). A similar mechanism has been proposed for the highly homologous factor Lefty2. Loss of function analysis of Nodal leads to a phenotype where no mesoderm is formed (14Conlon F.L. Lyons K.M. Takaesu N. Barth K.S. Kispert A. Herrmann B. Robertson E.J. Development. 1994; 120: 1919-1928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) while Lefty2-deficient mice show excessive mesoderm formation and expansion of the primitive streak as a consequence of overactivation of Nodal signaling (15Meno C. Gritsman K. Ohishi S. Ohfuji Y. Heckscher E. Mochida K. Shimono A. Kondoh H. Talbot W.S. Robertson E.J. Schier A.F. Hamada H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 287-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). No obvious defects in the stem cell compartment, the inner cell mass, were observed in Lefty2-deficient animals. However, redundancy between Lefty1 and Lefty2 might explain the lack of phenotypic consequences. The Lefty1-deficient mouse shows a phenotype in which the left-right axis is disturbed (16Meno C. Shimono A. Saijoh Y. Yashiro K. Mochida K. Ohishi S. Noji S. Kondoh H. Hamada H. Cell. 1998; 94: 287-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). There are currently no double knockouts reported. Nodal and both Lefties are under the control of Activin/Nodal and Smad2/3 signaling in the embryonic node (reviewed in Ref. 17Hamada H. Meno C. Watanabe D. Saijoh Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar).This study demonstrates that nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B, are the earliest genes showing decreased expression upon differentiation in non-conditioned medium (non-CM). It is shown that Activin/Nodal signaling in hESCs regulates all three genes. Activin A treatment induces expression of these genes, whereas treatment with the ALK4/5/7 kinase inhibitor SB-431542 (18Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar) inhibits their expression in undifferentiated cells. In hESCs grown under undifferentiated conditions in CM, Smad2/3 is phosphorylated, reflecting its activation, but its phosphorylation decreases when hESCs undergo differentiation in non-CM. When the regulatory sequence of lefty-A, which has multiple binding sites for the forkhead transcription factor FoxH1 (Fast1), a coactivator for Smad2/3, and sites for Smad2/3 itself, was fused to a luciferase reporter, comparable regulation during both pluripotency and differentiation was observed compared with the endogenous lefty-A expression. Luciferase expression increased when constitutively active ALK4 was co-expressed while co-expression of the repressive factor Smad7 inhibited luciferase expression. In addition, it has recently been reported that inhibition of GSK3, a hallmark of Wnt-signaling, using the kinase inhibitor 6-bromoindirubin-3′oxime (BIO, 1Sato N. Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar,19Meijer L. Skaltsounis A.L. Magiatis P. Polychronopoulos P. Knockaert M. Leost M. Ryan X.P.

Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). Here it is shown that undifferentiated hESCs grown in BIO without CM, maintain high mRNA levels for nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B as well as phosphorylation of Smad2/3 utilizing an active ALK4/5/7 receptor complex. These results suggest an interaction between inhibition of GSK-3 and Activin/Nodal signaling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and Antibodies—Human Activin A, and BMP4 were purchased from R&D.

The medium was conditioned by incubating 12 ml of medium for 24 h on hygromycin-resistent MEFs culture (5 × 106 cells/100 mm-diameter dish). MEFs (Specialty Media) were rendered growth-incompetent by treatment with mitomycin C by the manufacturer.

Oligonucleotides used for RT-PCR were custom-made by Integrated DNA Technologies (for primer sequences see Supplemental Data).Cell Transfection, Western Blotting, and Luciferase Assays—H1 and BGN2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE plus reagent (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Cells were either harvested for preparation of whole cell extracts (extraction buffer: 50 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, and complete miniprotease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) or luciferase extracts following the protocol of the manufacturer of the dual-luciferase assay (Promega). Cells for luciferase experiments were harvested 36 h after transfection. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activity was determined as recommended by Promega in a dual-luciferase luminometer (Lumat LB-9507, Berthold Technologies) and Western blotting of the respective whole cell extract (25 μg) was carried out following standard methods (21Sambrook J.

Sanjuan I.M. Heke M. Uchida M. Naef F. Brivanlou A.H. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). 24% of this set, 204 genes, was also present in mESCs analyzed by similar means (6Ramalho-Santos M. Yoon S. Matsuzaki Y. Mulligan R.C. Melton D.A. Science. 2002; 298: 597-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (1419) Google Scholar). In order to identify genes and/or signaling pathways that are involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state within this pool, 64 genes were selected based on their potential involvement in signal transduction and/or transcriptional regulation. The expression of these genes was assessed by comparative RT-PCR in H1 cells in a time course after withdrawal of MEF-conditioned medium (CM) (see Supplemental Data). The time-dependent regulation of 6 of the 64 genes is shown in Fig. 1A. Among the different genes tested in hESCs, nodal, lefty-A and lefty-B showed the earliest down-regulation after withdrawal of CM (Supplemental Data and Fig. 1). The level of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B transcripts drop to about 3% of their level in undifferentiated H1 cells within 24 h of CM withdrawal while the levels for all other 64 genes was still at 20% or higher of their initial value (Fig. 1B and Supplemental Data). These genes are also regulated in a similar way in another hESC line, BGN2 (Fig. 1C). Nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B mRNA levels decreased the most rapidly upon differentiation compared with all other genes tested. For this reason and in consideration of the fact that Nodal and Lefty-A are involved in early cell fate decisions in the induction of endo- and mesoderm, we decided to analyze their regulation in further detail.Activin/Nodal Signaling Is Required for the Regulation of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B—As mentioned above, nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B are regulated in response to Smad2 activation in the embryonic node (reviewed in Ref. 17Hamada H. Meno C. Watanabe D. Saijoh Y. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed their regulation by modulation of the Activin/Nodal signaling pathway, which regulates the activation of Smad2 (Fig. 2A). Activation of the pathway was achieved by treatment of BGN2 cells with Activin A whereas inhibition was carried out by treatment of the cells with the ALK4/5/7 kinase inhibitor SB-431542 (18Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1315) Google Scholar). Expression of all three genes decreased in cells grown in non-CM compared with cells grown in CM. Activin A led to increased expression of lefty-A in cells grown in non-CM while SB-431542 decreased its expression in cells grown in CM, both in a dose-dependent manner. When the cells were treated with Activin A and SB-431542 together, the levels of the genes were low, consistent with the fact that Activin A binds to ALK4 to activate Smad2/3. These results, taken together, demonstrate that nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B are selectively responsive to Activin/Nodal signaling in hESCs.Fig. 2Activin/Nodal signaling regulates nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B expression and expression of components of the TGFβ signaling pathway in hESCs and MEFs. A, RT-PCR analysis for the expression levels for nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B mRNA (as indicated) in BGN2 cells. Cells were grown in CM (lane 1), differentiated in non-CM over time (24 and 72 h, lanes 2 and 3), in non-CM with increasing amounts (10, 30, and 100 ng/ml) of recombinant Activin A (lanes 4–6), in CM with increasing amounts of SB-431542 (1, 3, 10 μm) (lanes 7–9), in non-CM with BIO (2 μm) alone (lane 11) or in non-CM in the presence of SB-431542 (10 μm) with Activin A (30 ng/ml, lane 10) or BIO (2 μm, lane 12). The treatment with Activin-A, SB-431542, BIO, or combination of these agents was done for 72 h in CM or non-CM as indicated. β-Actin expression was used as loading control and as negative control for omission of reverse transcriptase (β-actin -RT). B, RT-PCR analysis for mRNA expression levels of tgfβ-1,2,3, inhibin α, inhibin βA, inhibin βB, and gdf1 in MEFs. hprt expression was used as positive control and as negative control for omission of reverse transcriptase (hprt-RT). Expression of inhibin βC, inhibin βE, and nodal was not detected. C, RT-PCR analysis of activin type I receptors alk1–7, as described in Fig. 1, for undifferentiated (CM) and differentiated for 72 h (72) H1 and BGN2 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)BIO Requires Activation of Smad2/3 for the Regulation of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B—It has been shown that inhibition of GSK3 by a small molecular weight compound, called BIO (1Sato N.

Meijer L. Skaltsounis L. Greengard P. Brivanlou A.H. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1714) Google Scholar). We tested the effect of BIO on the expression levels of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B with or without SB-431542. Fig. 2A shows that BIO in the absence of CM maintained the endogenous expression of all three genes to levels comparable with the expression in CM, while SB-431542 blocked induction of the genes induced by BIO. These results suggest that the induction of the genes whether it derives from conditioned medium or BIO treatment, requires a functional ALK4/5/7 pathway.Expression Status of Components of the TGFβ Signaling Pathway—A list of TGFβ pathway components present in the H1 line is shown in Table I. The values were determined by global gene expression analysis (7Sato N. Sanjuan I.M. Heke M. Uchida M. Naef F. Brivanlou A.H. Dev. Biol. 2003; 260: 404-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar) of H1 cells maintained undifferentiated or induced to differentiate. The list comprises 44 different molecules involved in TGFβ signaling either as ligands, receptors, Smads, or modulators of the pathway. The table compares the expression values for the molecules in undifferentiated (CM) and differentiated (non-CM) conditions and gives the relative indices for the expression (Fold CM/n-CM). While most genes are not regulated (fold value between 0.5 and 2) several genes show a significantly higher expression in undifferentiated cells, including lefty-A, lefty-B, and tdgf-1 (cripto), as stated above, as well as cerberus, gdf3, foxH1, and oaz. Other genes, such as TGFβ2, follistatin splice variant 344 (FST sv344), TGFβR-II, and ltbp-1, are up-regulated upon differentiation.Table IComponents of the TGFβ signaling pathway in H1 hESCs Table I shows the expression levels of several TGFβ pathway components as observed in a global expression profile using microarrays on the Affymetrix U133A Chip (7Sato N.

The second column gives the relative expression value for the respective gene in the presence of CM. The third column gives the relative expression value in the absence of CM (non-CM) for three weeks. The fourth column gives the index for the expression between CM and non-CM, thus a measure whether the gene decreases (>1), increases (<1) or remains unchanged upon differentiation (=1). A value between 0.5 and 2 (not bolded) does not allow a conclusive statement on the gene regulation since this value falls into the range of uncertainty (2-fold).CMnon-CMFold (CM/non-CM)Ligandstgfβ2417740.05inhibin βC4712571.8inhibin βE1201131.1bmp-21501461bmp-71561051.5gdf33721362.7nodalaThere were relevant genes, e.g. nodal, that are not represented on the U133A chip.

https://openalex.org/W1999280381,We compare the energy efficiency of hybrid and fuel cell vehicles as well as conventional internal combustion engines. Our analysis indicates that fuel cell vehicles using hydrogen from fossil fuels offer no significant energy efficiency advantage over hybrid vehicles operating in an urban drive cycle. We conclude that priority should be placed on hybrid vehicles by industry and government.
https://openalex.org/W2083971880,"The inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunit Kir5.1 is expressed abundantly in the brain, but its precise distribution and function are still largely unknown. Because Kir5.1 is co-expressed with Kir4.1 in retinal glial Müller cells, we have compared the biochemical and immunological properties of Kir5.1 and Kir4.1 in the mouse brain. Immunoprecipitation experiments suggested that brain expressed at least two subsets of Kir channels, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1. Immunolabeling using specific antibodies showed that channels comprising Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 subunits were assembled in a region-specific fashion. Heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 was identified in the neocortex and in the glomeruli of the olfactory bulb. Homomeric Kir4.1 was confined to the hippocampus and the thalamus. Homomeric Kir5.1 was not identified. Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 expression appeared to occur only in astrocytes, specifically in the membrane domains facing the pia mater and blood vessels or in the processes surrounding synapses. Both Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 could be associated with PDZ domain-containing syntrophins, which might be involved in the subcellular targeting of these astrocyte Kir channels. Because heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1 have distinct ion channel properties (Tanemoto, M., Kittaka, N., Inanobe, A., and Kurachi, Y. (2000) J. Physiol.

Chem. 275, 16404-16407), it is plausible that these channels play differential physiological roles in the K+-buffering action of brain astrocytes in a region-specific manner.

Glial cells are highly specialized support cells in the nervous system. They exert their functions by closely associating with neuronal synapses, axons, dendrites, and soma (3Netter F.H. The CIBA Collection of Medical Illustrations: Nervous System. CIBA Foundation, London1983: 131-147Google Scholar). Glial cell processes can also reach out to more distant regions such as blood vessels, the pia mater, and the vitreous humor. Astrocytes are a particular subset of glial cells whose primary function lies in the control of the ionic and osmotic composition of the extracellular environment. Physiological analyses have revealed that astrocytes possess a large K+ conductance (4Kuffler S.W. Nicholls J.G. Ergeb. Physiol. 1966; 57: 1-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 5Newman E.A. Nature. 1984; 309: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) that is thought to be involved in the polarized transport of K+ from regions of high extracellular K+ ([K+]o) to those of low [K+]o. This “spatial buffering of K+,” which is also known as “K+-siphoning” when applied to retinal astrocytes (Müller cells), is thought to be essential for the maintenance of neuronal activity as it prevents accumulation of excess [K+]o, which would otherwise interfere with neuronal excitability (5Newman E.A. Nature. 1984; 309: 155-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 6Orkand R.K. Nicholls J.G. Kuffler S.W. J. Neurophysiol. 1966; 29: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (872) Google Scholar). Because an inwardly rectifying K+ (Kir) channel subunit, Kir4.1, and a water channel, AQP4, are found closely co-localized on specific membrane domains of astrocytes and Müller cells, it is assumed that the K+ buffering is also essential for neural osmotic homeostasis by coupling with water movement (7Dietzel I.

Agre P. Ottersen O.P. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been proposed that Kir4.1 is a major component of the K+ conductance in brain astrocytes and retinal Müller cells (14Ishii M. Horio Y. Tada Y. Hibino H. Inanobe A. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kurachi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7725-7735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Poopalasundaram S. Knott C. Shamotienko O.G. Foran P.G. Dolly J.O. Ghiani C.A. Gallo V. Wilkin G.P.

A recent immunohistochemical study of the retina has revealed that Müller cells express not only homomeric Kir4.1 but also heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels (18Ishii M. Fujita A. Iwai K. Kusaka S. Higashi K. Inanobe A. Hibino H. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The two Kir channels distributed differentially within a Müller cell. They also have different biophysical properties and intracellular pH (pHi) dependence (1Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Tucker S.J. Imbrici P. Salvatore L. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2980-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, suggested that the two Kir channels play distinct functional roles in the buffering of K+; the homomeric Kir4.1 localized at end feet facing the vitreous surface and at processes wrapping blood vessels may allow K+ extrusion, whereas heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels at processes surrounding neurons may be responsible for pHi-dependent K+ uptake. Although it was shown that Kir5.1 subunit was abundantly expressed in the brain as well (20Derst C. Karschin C. Wischmeyer E. Hirsch J.R. Preisig-Muller R. Rajan S. Engel H. Grzeschik K. Daut J. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 491: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 21Tanemoto M. Fujita A. Higashi K. Kurachi Y. Neuron. 2002; 34: 387-397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), little is known about its role in formation of brain Kir channel and its precise distribution. In the present study we compared the biochemical and immunological properties of brain Kir5.1 and Kir4.1. We found that the Kir subunits form at least two types of channels, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1, in the brain. Both Kir channels were expressed in astrocytes but not in neurons. Within an astrocyte, each type of Kir channel distributed to specific membrane domains, i.e. perivascular or perisynaptic area, in a region-specific manner. We also found that Kir4.1/5.1 and Kir4.1 channels could bind syntrophins, which are components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC). 1The abbreviations used are: DAPC, dystrophin-associated protein complex; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein. Because the DAPC has been proposed to be responsible for the polarized distribution of Kir4.1 in Müller cells (22Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Connors N.C. Adams M.E. Froehner S.C. Kofuji P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28387-28392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), syntrophins may be at least partially involved in the targeting of the Kir channels to a specific membrane domain in astrocytes. Taken together our results suggest that the assembly of Kir5.1 with Kir4.1 conveys particular properties to the K+-buffering action of astrocytes in various areas of the brain. Antibodies—Generation of specific antibodies against Kir4.1 (KAB-2C2) and Kir5.1 (Kir5.1-NR1) was as previously described (18Ishii M. Fujita A. Iwai K. Kusaka S. Higashi K. Inanobe A. Hibino H.

Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Antibodies specific for Kir4.2 (epitope; residues 347-366 of mouse Kir4.2, GenBank™ accession number O88932) and AQP4 (epitope; residues 249-323 of rat AQP4, GenBank™ accession number P47863) were purchased from Alomone Laboratories (Jerusalem, Israel). Preparation of Membrane Fractions and Western Blotting—Membrane fractions of kidney and brain were prepared as described elsewhere (25Marples D. Schroer T.A. Ahrens N. Taylor A. Knepper M.A. Nielsen S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 1998; 274: 384-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, whole brain and kidney cortex of adult female C57BL/6 mice (7∼8 weeks old) were homogenized in 9 volumes of dissecting buffer (0.3 m sucrose, 25 mm imidazole, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The homogenate was centrifuged at 4000 × g for 15 min to remove nuclei, mitochondria, and any remaining large cellular fragments. The supernatant was further centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was harvested as a membrane fraction. The membrane protein was then heated for 10 min at 70 °C in the sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-Kir4.1, anti-Kir4.2, or anti-Kir5.1 antibody. Deglycosylation and Inhibition of Glycosylation—Extracellular glycocalyx moieties were removed from brain and renal membrane proteins (deglycosylation) by dilution of 40 μg of protein in a buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P40, pH 7.2, and incubated with N-glycosidase F (Roche Applied Science) for 17 h at 37 °C. The proteins were directly analyzed using Western blotting. In some cases glycosylation of transiently expressed Kir4.1 and Kir4.2 protein (HEK293T) was inhibited by supplementing the culture medium with 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (Sigma) for 15 h. The cells were harvested, lysed by a solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 150 mm NaCl in 40 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, and finally analyzed by Western blotting. Tissue Culture and Immunoprecipitation—Using LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, we transiently transfected HEK293T cells with full-length cDNA of either Kir4.1 or Kir5.1 inserted into the mammalian expression vectors pCMV-HA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) or pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen), respectively. Some experiments employed simultaneous co-expression of an Myc-tagged construct of full-length α-syntrophin inserted into pCMV-Myc (Clontech), which had been obtained by reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain. Interaction between heteromeric Kir4.1, Kir5.1, and α-syntrophin was assessed by co-transfection of all three constructs. The cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection, and immunoprecipitation assays were conducted as previously described (26Hibino H. Pironkova R. Onwumere O. Vologodskaia M. Hudspeth A.J. Lesage F. Neuron. 2002; 34: 411-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Briefly, after extraction with a lysis solution containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, and 150 mm NaCl in 40 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, the proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of anti-Myc antibody-conjugated beads (Clontech). Subsequently, the beads were washed four times with the above solution and spun down, and co-precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-Kir4.1, anit-Kir5.1, or anti-Myc antibody. Immunoprecipitation assays using native tissues were done by extracting the membrane fraction from brain and kidney with lysis solution followed by precipitation of A/G-agarose beads (30 μl) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) conjugated to preimmune IgG, anti-Kir4.1, or anti-Kir5.1 antibody (0.6 μg each) with 500 μg of solubilized protein. Glutathione S-Transferase (GST) Pull-down Assays—DNA fragments corresponding to PDZ domains of α (amino acid residues 70-188, GenBank™ accession number U00677), β1 (81-220, accession number U89997), β2 (51-208, accession number U00678), and γ1 (41-177, accession number AF367759) syntrophins were amplified via reverse transcription-PCR from mouse brain and subcloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). The BL21 strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the vector constructs, and protein expression was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3-4 h at 37 °C. Bacteria were sonicated in lysis buffer and centrifuged, the lysates were recovered, and the fusion proteins were purified on glutathione-Sepharose. Pull-down assays were done as previously described (27Hibino H. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Fujita A. Doi K. Kubo T. Hata Y. Takai Y. Kurachi Y. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). HEK293T cells transfected with GFP-tagged Kir4.1, Kir5.1, or Kir4.1 plus Kir5.1 (in pEGFP, Clontech) were solubilized in lysis buffer and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. One hundred micrograms of solubilized proteins were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads bound to 5 μg of purified fusion protein. Samples were washed 4 times at room temperature with the same buffer. The materials retained on the beads were eluted with sample-buffer solution and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting using anti-GFP or anti-Kir5.1 antibody. Immunohistochemistry—All of the brain samples for immunohistochemistry were prepared as previously described (28Hibino H. Horio Y. Inanobe A. Doi K. Ito M. Yamada M. Gotow T. Uchiyama Y. Kawamura M.

Briefly, the bodies of adult female C57BL/6 mice, which were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (100 mg/kg), were perfused from their left ventricle with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, and the brains were isolated.

In short, cryosections of brain (12 μm) were at first incubated with anti-Kir5.1 (4 μg/ml; Figs. 2 and 3A) or anti-Kir4.1 (0.3 μg/ml; Fig. 3A), then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Fab fragment) secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Subsequent to another phosphate-buffered saline wash, either anti-Kir4.1 (0.3 μg/ml; Fig. 2) or anti-AQP4 (0.2 μg/ml; Fig. 3A) was applied to the brain sections. The sections were washed again with phosphate-buffered saline and finally treated with Texas Red-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody. The samples were examined under an LSM-510 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). To confirm the specificity of the double-labeling, we incubated the sections with IgG derived from rabbit preimmune serum instead of anti-Kir4.1 or AQP4 antibody and observed no fluorescence of Texas Red in the sections (data not shown).Fig. 3Distribution and localization of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in the neocortex.A, double-immunolabeling with anti-AQP4 (red) and either Kir4.1 or Kir5.1 indicated co-localization of both Kir subunits with AQP4 in astrocyte processes attaching to the pia mater (arrowheads) or wrapping around blood vessels (arrows).

Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 922-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Kir4.1 (6 μg/ml) or anti-Kir5.1 (40 μg/ml) was used to examine thin sections (thickness, 75∼90 nm) of mouse brain neocortex. Resulting immunoreactivity was visualized by the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Biochemical Characterization of Brain Kir4.1 and Kir5.1—We first examined the expression of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 in the mouse brain using antibodies of established specificity (18Ishii M. Fujita A.

Isomoto S. Ito H. Mori K. Tonosaki A. Tomoike H. Kurachi Y. FEBS Lett. 1996; 388: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In some experiments we also examined the renal expression of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 for comparison (1Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Tucker S.J. Imbrici P. Salvatore L. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. J. Biol.

In brain preparations the anti-Kir4.1 antibody visualized four protein bands at ∼40, ∼80, ∼160, and ∼250 kDa in the SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1Aa, first lane). The molecular mass of the lowest band (∼40 kDa) was almost identical to the predicted mass of the Kir4.1 subunit based on its cDNA length (∼42 kDa), suggesting that this band represented monomeric Kir4.1. Kir channels are tetrameric, and it is likely that the ∼80- and ∼160-kDa fragments correspond to complexes of 2 and 4 Kir subunits that contain at least one Kir4.1 subunit. The heaviest fragment (∼250 kDa) may represent a macro protein complex containing Kir4.1 (17Li L. Head V. Timpe L.C. Glia. 2001; 33: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Connors N.C. Kofuji P. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 4321-4327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A slightly different pattern was found in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells transfected with Kir4.1 cDNA (Fig. 1Ad). In addition to the bands at ∼80, ∼160, and ∼250 kDa (data not shown), two bands appeared at ∼33 and ∼38 kDa (Fig. 1Ad, first lane) rather than at ∼40 kDa, corresponding to the putative brain Kir4.1 monomer (Fig. 1Ad, third lane). Kir4.1 possesses an N-glycosylation motif in its extracellular domain (33Takumi T. Ishii T. Horio Y. Morishige K. Takahashi N. Yamada M. Yamashita T. Kiyama H. Sohmiya K. Nakanishi S. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16339-16346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), and the degree of glycosylation may alter the mobility of the protein on gels. Preincubation of the transfected cells with tunicamycin, a glycosylation inhibitor, abolished the ∼38-kDa fragment and enhanced the band at ∼33 kDa (Fig. 1Ad, second lane). Treatment of brain protein fractions with a deglycosylation agent, N-glycosidase, shifted some of the ∼40-kDa fragment to ∼33 kDa (Fig. 1Ad, fourth lane). We, therefore, conclude that the band at ∼40 kDa in the brain preparation and the ∼38-kDa band from Kir4.1-transfected HEK293T cells represent monomeric Kir4.1 subunits. The deglycosylated Kir4.1 monomers showed faster electrophoretic mobility (∼33 kDa) than that predicted from its molecular mass (∼42 kDa). Control experiments conducted in the kidney showed that the anti-Kir4.1 antibody detected several fragments at ∼50-kDa, but no bands corresponding to the multimers were observed in the brain (Fig. 1Aa, third lane). Glycosylation inhibitors reduced Kir4.1 immunoreactivity in the kidney from ∼50 to ∼33 kDa (Fig. 1Aa, fourth lane). Glycosylation of Kir4.1 was, thus, notably higher in the kidney. On the other hand, immunoanalysis of Kir5.1 protein in the brain and kidney yielded only one clear band at ∼36 kDa (Fig. 1Ab). This was considerably smaller than the estimated size of Kir5.1 based on its cDNA length (∼46 kDa). Similarly, we found only one band at ∼36 kDa in preparations from HEK293T cells transfected with Kir5.1 cDNA (data not shown). The Kir4.2 channel subunit is known to couple with Kir5.1 in the kidney (Fig. 1Ac, second lane) (34Pearson W.L. Dourado M. Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 639-653Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 35Konstas A.A. Korbmacher C. Tucker S.J. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: 910-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). But in the brain we detected no significant signal for Kir4.2 protein (Fig. 1Ac, first lane), although its mRNA has been reported to be expressed (36Gosset P. Ghezala G.A. Korn B. Yaspo M.L. Poutska A. Lehrach H. Sinet P.M. Creau N. Genomics. 1997; 44: 237-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). On SDS-PAGE the Kir4.2 protein expressed in HEK293T cells was detected at ∼37 and ∼35 kDa and in kidney at ∼45, ∼37, and ∼35 kDa (Fig. 1Ae, first and third lanes, respectively). Like Kir4.1, Kir4.2 possesses a glycosylation motif (34Pearson W.L. Dourado M. Schreiber M. Salkoff L. Nichols C.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 514: 639-653Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 37Shuck M.E. Piser T.M. Bock J.H. Slightom J.L. Lee K.S. Bienkowski M.J. J. Biol.

In the presence of glycosylation inhibitors, Kir4.2 proteins were represented by a single band at ∼35 kDa in both cases (Fig. 1Ae, second and fourth lanes). Assembly of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 has been reported to yield functional Kir channels in renal epithelia (1Tanemoto M. Kittaka N. Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 525: 587-592Crossref Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 2Tucker S.J. Imbrici P. Salvatore L. D'Adamo M.C. Pessia M. J. Biol.

Cell Physiol. 2003; 285: 260-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To see if such heteromeric assembly occurred in the brain, we performed immunoprecipitation with solubilized brain lysate using the antibodies for Kir4.1 or Kir5.1 (Figs. 1B, a and b). The immunoprecipitants with anti-Kir5.1 contained Kir4.1-immunoreactivity (∼40 kDa; Fig. 1Ba, fourth lane, wide solid arrowhead), and those precipitated with anti-Kir4.1 contained Kir5.1 (∼36 kDa; Fig. 1Bb, third lane, wide solid arrowhead). This data suggests that the brain expresses Kir4.1/5.1 heteromers but in neither set of immunoprecipitates did cross-reaction of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 antibodies occur at anything other than the monomer protein level. Although in the precipitants with anti-Kir4.1 antibody the same antibody detected protein bands corresponding to dimers (∼80 kDa) and tetramers (∼160 kDa) (Fig. 1Ba, third lane), these were not recognized by the anti-Kir5.1 antibody (Fig. 1Bb, third lane). Immunoreactivity for Kir5.1 in the Kir5.1-antibody precipitants could only be detected at gel positions consistent with monomeric Kir5.1 (Fig. 1Bb, fourth lane). This single band was also recognized in the precipitants with the anti-Kir4.1 antibody when they were probed with anti-Kir5.1 antibody (Fig. 1Bb, third lane, wide solid arrowhead). No Kir4.1 immunoreactivity at ∼80 or ∼160 kDa was detected in the immunoprecipitants with anti-Kir5.1 antibody (Fig. 1Ba, fourth lane). It, therefore, seems that in the brain neither homomeric Kir5.1 nor heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 channels maintain their subunit association during SDS-PAGE analysis. On the other hand, the homomeric interaction between Kir4.1 subunits is preserved. Taken together these observations imply that Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 form at least two sets of functional Kir channels in the brain, heteromeric Kir4.1/5.1 and homomeric Kir4.1, although on this basis we cannot exclude the possibility of homomeric Kir5.1 channels. Distribution of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 Proteins in the Brain—Double-immunolabeling showed that Kir5.1 co-localized with astrocyte-specific glial fibrillary acidic protein but not with neuron-specific enolase in the neocortex (data not shown), which suggests that, like Kir4.1 (16Higashi K. Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 922-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Kir5.1 is expressed exclusively in astrocytes and not in neurons. Kir4.1 is abundantly expressed in astrocytes of many brain regions (16Higashi K. Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 922-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li L. Head V. Timpe L.C. Glia. 2001; 33: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We, therefore, compared the distribution of Kir5.1 in mouse brain with that of Kir4.1 by double-immunolabeling (Fig. 2). Strong labeling for Kir4.1 (red) and Kir5.1 (green) was detected in the neocortex (Fig. 2A), with notable overlaps in various regions (yellow), especially around the blood vessels (arrows) as well as deep in the pia mater (arrowheads). Co-localization of Kir4.1 and Kir5.1 was also detected in astrocytes of other regions, such as the pontine nucleus and the cranial nerve nuclei of the hindbrain (data not shown). Double-immunolabeling with anti-Kir4.1 and anti-Kir5.1 antibodies produced yellow signals on the inside and at the edges of the olfactory glomeruli (Fig. 2B). Careful examination of the images revealed that the outside of the glomeruli (arrowheads) was primarily labeled by anti-Kir4.1, with only a weak signal for Kir5.1. We next examined the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Fig. 2C). Kir4.1 was moderately expressed in the processes of astrocytes in the pyramidal cell layer and the stratum radiatum (16Higashi K. Fujita A. Inanobe A. Tanemoto M. Doi K. Kubo T. Kurachi Y. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2001; 281: 922-931Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li L. Head V. Timpe L.C. Glia. 2001; 33: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Relatively weak labeling for Kir5.1 was scattered in or close to the pyramidal cell layer, where it was largely co-localized with the Kir4.1-specific signal. In stratum radiatum, although little Kir5.1-immunoreactivity was detected, Kir4."

Magnetohydrodynamic simulations show a well-defined jet that extracts energy from a black hole. If plasma near the black hole is threaded by large-scale magnetic flux, it will rotate with respect to asymptotic infinity, creating large magnetic stresses. These stresses are released as a relativistic jet at the expense of black hole rotational energy. The physics of the jet initiation in the simulations is described by the theory of black hole gravitohydromagnetics."

https://openalex.org/W2014039677,"The histone acetyl transferase Tip60 (HTATIP) shares many properties with the tumor suppressor p53 (TP53). Both proteins are involved in the cellular response to DNA damage, are subjected to proteasomal digestion following Mdm2-mediated ubiquitination, and accumulate after UV irradiation. We found here that knock-down of Tip60 affects the p53-dependent response following actinomycin D treatment, most likely because it inhibits p21 (CDKN1A) accumulation. Moreover, Tip60 is required for p53 to activate the endogenous p21 promoter, suggesting that it functions as a p53 co-activator. However, we also found that knock-down of Tip60 increases the turnover rate of p53 under normal growth conditions. Tip60 interferes with Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53, probably because it affects its subcellular localization. Taken together, our results suggest that Tip60 plays a double role in the p53 pathway: under normal growth conditions, Tip60 contributes to maintain a basal pool of p53 by interfering with its degradation; following DNA damage, Tip60 functions as p53 co-activator. That these two distinct roles are linked during the p53-dependent response is an attractive hypothesis.

That these two distinct roles are linked during the p53-dependent response is an attractive hypothesis. Eukaryotes have developed a variety of pathways to ensure genomic integrity. Following DNA damage, a cellular response is induced, which leads to cell cycle arrest to complete DNA repair or, alternatively, to apoptosis. In mammalian cells, the appropriate response to DNA damage is in part controlled by the p53 tumor suppressor (TP53) (1Vousden K.H. Cell. 2000; 103: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). p53 is a sequence-specific transcription factor, whose activity is induced by DNA damage. In turn, it regulates transcription of a variety of genes involved in proliferation control or apoptosis. Although several genes repressed by p53 have been described, the primary function of p53 is to activate transcription of genes containing p53-binding sites in their promoters, such as the gene encoding the p21 cyclin/cdk inhibitor (CDKN1A). The products of these genes are mostly involved in cell cycle control, apoptosis, and DNA repair (2Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). The balance between pro-apoptotic and growth arrest-related genes activated by p53 is believed to control the choice between apoptosis or growth arrest. In the absence of p53, the cellular response to DNA damage is abnormal leading to the accumulation of mutations. Therefore, not surprisingly, the p53-encoding gene is frequently mutated in many human cancers (3Michael D. Oren M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 53-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In the absence of DNA damage, p53 activity is largely controlled by the Mdm2 proto-oncoprotein. Mdm2 binds directly to p53, and represses its activity by two independent mechanisms: First, it functions as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 (4Honda R. Tanaka H. Yasuda H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar) and thereby induces p53 degradation via the proteasome (5Haupt Y. Maya R. Kazaz A. Oren M. Nature. 1997; 387: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (3629) Google Scholar, 6Kubbutat M.H. Jones S.N. Vousden K.H. Nature. 1997; 387: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (2798) Google Scholar). Second, binding of Mdm2 to p53 blocks transcriptional activation by p53 (7Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B.

Cell. 1992; 69: 1237-1245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2760) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, p53 is phosphorylated by the ATM/ATR chk1/chk2 pathway, leading to the dissociation of the p53/Mdm2 interaction and the subsequent activation of p53-responsive genes (2Oren M. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar).

Tip60 (HTATIP), since overexpression of a dominant negative HAT-defective Tip60 mutant decreases both DNA repair and apoptosis upon induction of DNA double strand breaks (9Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V.

Tip60 is a HAT of the MYST family, which mostly acetylates histone H4 (10Yamamoto T. Horikoshi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30595-30598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). It is part of a multimolecular complex, the Tip60 complex, which contains, in addition to Tip60, a number of proteins including the Trrap mediator protein (9Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M.

Furthermore, the presence of endogenous Tip60 on c-Myc or NFκB target genes correlates with their transcriptional activation (15Frank S.R. Parisi T. Taubert S. Fernandez P. Fuchs M. Chan H.M. Livingston D.M. Amati B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 16Baek S.H. Ohgi K.A. Rose D.W. Koo E.H. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Cell. 2002; 110: 55-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Moreover, overexpression of a HAT-deficient dominant negative mutant of Tip60 delayed the appearance of histone H4 acetylation on Myc-targeted promoters (15Frank S.R. Parisi T. Taubert S. Fernandez P. Fuchs M. Chan H.M. Livingston D.M. Amati B. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). All these results are consistent with a model in which Tip60 participates in transcriptional activation of specific genes through local histone acetylation. However, it should be noted that, in some instances, Tip60 was found to function as a transcriptional co-repressor (17Gavaravarapu S. Kamine J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 269: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We recently reported that Tip60 is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, suggesting that p53 and Tip60 are regulated in a similar manner. Moreover, Tip60 expression was increased upon UV irradiation of Jurkat cells (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that Tip60 and p53 functionally cooperate in the DNA damage response. We found here that Tip60 expression is critical for a proper p53-dependent response to actinomycin D, certainly by allowing activation of an important p53-responsive gene, the gene encoding the p21 cyclin/cdk inhibitor. The importance of Tip60 is underlined by the fact that Tip60 plays two distinct roles in the p53-dependent response: first, it functions as a co-factor for p53 to activate the endogenous p21 promoter, and second, it has the capacity to inhibit Mdm2-induced ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of p53. Plasmids, Antibodies, and siRNAs—Details of constructions will be provided upon request. The anti-Tip60 DT antibody has been described previously (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The anti-HA antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science (12CA5) or Eurogentec (Babco). The anti-MDM2 antibody (SMP14), the anti-p21 antibody (C19), the anti-p53 antibodies (FL393, and DO-1), and the anti-PML antibody (PG-M3) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. All secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma, except for the AlexaFluor-conjugated antimouse antibody (BD Biosciences). Tip1 and c1 (control 1 from Dharmacon) siRNAs were purchased from Dharmacon, whereas Tip2, p53, and c2 were from Eurogentec (Belgium). C2 is derived from the mouse vinculin sequence and does not recognize any human mRNA. The sequence of the top strands of the various siRNA were as follows: c1, CAUGUCAUGUGUCACAUCU-dTdT; c2, GCGGAUUAGAACCAAUCUC-dTdT; Tip1, ACGGAAGGUGGAGGUGGUU-dTdT; Tip2, CGUCUGGAUGAAUGGGUGA-dTdT; p53, GACUCCAGUGGUAAUCUAC-dTdT. Cell Culture and Transfections—U2OS cells, H1299 cells, and HeLa cells stably transfected by HA-Tip60 (kindly provided by V. Ogryzko) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. For proteasome inhibition, cells were treated with 100 μm ALLN (Sigma) for 12 h. Actinomycin D treatment (5 nm) was performed for 15 h. Transfections with plasmids were performed by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method or with Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen) (for H1299 cells). Cells were harvested 24 h following transfection. For the siRNA experiments, 105 cells were transfected with 4 μl of oligofectamine (Invitrogen), and 10 μl of the double-stranded RNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48 h following transfection. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were measured using a kit from Promega and from Tropix, respectively, according to the manufacturers' instructions. Immunofluorescence Analysis—For immunofluorescence staining, cells were plated on glass coverslips. 24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in PBS supplemented with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and permeabilized in PBS supplemented with 0.5% Triton for 10 min. After a 30-min incubation in blocking buffer (PBS-BSA3%), cells were stained with primary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, then incubated with the secondary fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies. After several washes, coverslips were mounted in Dabco-DAPI, and analyzed with a microscope (Leica). Cell Extracts, Glutathione S-transferase Pull-downs, and Immunoprecipitations—For total cell extracts, cells were directly lysed in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Cell extracts followed by immunoprecipitations were performed from transfected cells as described in Ref. 19Nicolas E. Morales V. Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Harel-Bellan A. Richard-Foy H. Trouche D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9797-9804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar. Briefly, cells were collected in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2) supplemented with protease inhibitors (Complete EDTA-free, Roche Applied Science) and DNase (Coger). After centrifugation, total cells extracts were diluted in 500 μl of dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.4% Nonidet P-40). After a preclearing step, immunoprecipitations were performed overnight using 1 μg of antibody and 10 μl of protein A/protein G beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were then washed three times in washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.4% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm MgCl2) and analyzed by Western blotting. Analysis of Cell Cycle Distribution—Cells were treated 20 min with BrdUrd (10 mm). Cells were then trypsinized, fixed with ethanol, and incubated for 30 min in 4 n HCl, 0.5% Triton. Cells were then extensively washed in PBS supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin, incubated for 1 h with an anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences) and then 30 min with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma). Cells were then stained with propidium iodide (BD Pharmingen) and analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences) on FL1 (anti-BrdUrd) and FL3 (propidium iodide) to determine their cell cycle distribution. RT Q-PCR Analysis—Total RNA were extracted from 1 × 106 transfected U2OS cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Elution was performed with 50 μl of H2O. First-strand cDNA was generated using 15 μg of the total RNA in a standard reverse transcriptase reaction using a poly(dT) oligonucleotide as a primer and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Inc.). The final concentration of cDNA was 0.5 μg/μl. 1.5 μg of cDNA were then subjected to real time PCR analysis. Real time PCR was performed using Sybr green I (Sigma) and Platinium Quantitative PCR Supermix-UDG (Invitrogen) on a ICyclerQ™ (Bio-Rad) real-time PCR device. Each experiment included a standard curve. The annealing temperature were 60 °C (Tip60 cDNA), 60 °C (ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 cDNA), 62.5 °C (p21 cDNA). The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follow: GTCAGAACCGGCTGGGGATG and TGAGCGAGGCACAAGGGTAC for p21 cDNA, CAGGACAGCTCTGATGGAATAC and AGAGGACAGGCAATGTGGTGAG for Tip60 cDNA; GGCGACCTGGAAGTCCAACT and CCATCAGCACCACAGCCTTC for control ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 cDNA. Samples were analyzed in triplicates. Tip60 Expression Is Important for the p53 Pathway—We previously showed that Tip60 is co-regulated with p53, presumably because both proteins are targeted by Mdm2 (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These data led us to investigate the role of Tip60 in the p53 pathway. We designed a short interfering RNA targeting human Tip60. Although the effects of anti-Tip60 short interfering RNA treatment are difficult to assess on endogenous Tip60 protein due to its very low expression level (data not shown), Fig. 1A shows that this siRNA efficiently decreased Tip60 protein levels in a cell line stably expressing HA-tagged Tip60 (9Ikura T. Ogryzko V.V. Grigoriev M. Groisman R. Wang J. Horikoshi M. Scully R. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 2000; 102: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Moreover, by reverse transcription followed by real time PCR, we found that transfection of this anti-Tip60 siRNA in p53-positive U2OS cells led to the specific decrease of Tip60 mRNA expression (see Fig. 1D for example), with an efficiency comparable to what has been described recently (20Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of Tip60 knock-down on the cell cycle arrest induced by actinomycin D in U2OS cells (Fig. 1B). We found that, as expected, actinomycin D treatment (Act. D) induced an accumulation of cells in G1 (black bars) and G2/M (hatched bars), both in non-transfected cells and in cells transfected by a control siRNA (c2) (which does not affect HA-Tip60 expression (data not shown)). The amount of S phase cells (gray bars) decreased in parallel. Transfection of U2OS cells with anti-Tip60 siRNA led to a slight but reproducible increase of G2/M cells in the absence of actinomycin D. Strikingly, upon actinomycin D treatment, a significant amount of cells transfected with the anti-Tip60 siRNAs were still actively replicating DNA (gray bar). Moreover, the percentage of G1 cells was far lower than in cells transfected by the control siRNAs, indicating that the G1 arrest was ablated in these cells. In contrast, these cells still accumulated in G2/M, suggesting that the G2/M checkpoint was still active. This result indicates that upon Tip60 knock-down, the G1 arrest is defective, which indicates that Tip60 is required for a proper p53-response to actinomycin D. Strikingly, this result is similar to what has been found by Berns et al. (20Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) following ionizing radiation, indicating that the role of Tip60 in the p53 response is not dependent on the DNA damage inducer. Arrest of cells in G1 following DNA damage is largely due to activation by p53 of the p21 cyclin/cdk inhibitor expression. We thus investigated the effect of Tip60 knock-down on p21 expression by Western blot. We found that endogenous p21 expression, which is controlled by endogenous p53 in U2OS cells (21Tang H.Y. Zhao K. Pizzolato J.F. Fonarev M. Langer J.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29156-29163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was severely inhibited upon Tip60 knock-down both at the protein (Fig. 1C) and the mRNA (Fig. 1D) level. Interestingly, knock-down of either Tip60 or p53 had a similar effect on p21 mRNA expression (Fig. 1D). Moreover, we found that, upon actinomycin D treatment (Act. D), accumulation of p21 protein was greatly decreased in cells transfected by the Tip60 siRNA compared with control cells (Fig. 1E). Thus taken together, these results suggest that Tip60 expression is required for the p53-dependent response, by a mechanism involving, at least in part, p21 expression control. Tip60 Expression Is Required for Activation of Endogenous p21 Expression by Exogenous p53—Since Tip60 is a HAT, we envisioned the possibility that it could function as a p53 coactivator. To test this possibility, we performed gene reporter assays using promoters driven by p53 binding sites in the presence or absence of exogenous p53. Upon transient transfection of such reporters in U2OS cells, we did not find any effect of either Tip60 overexpression or Tip60 knock-down (data not shown and Fig. 2, graph), indicating that using this experimental setting, Tip60 was not involved in p53 transcriptional activity. We reasoned that this lack of effect could be due to the fact that transiently transfected reporter vectors do not harbor a canonical chromatin structure, and therefore would not allow to detect some chromatin-dependent effects. We thus also investigated in these experiments the expression of an endogenous p53 target, p21, by Western blot. We found that Tip60 knock-down completely blocked the ability of exogenous p53 to induce endogenous p21 expression (Fig. 2, middle panel, lanes 3 and 4), although exogenous p53 was nicely expressed as shown by Western blot (upper panel) and by its ability to transactivate a co-transfected p53-dependent reporter vector (graph). Thus, Tip60 expression is required for p53 to activate the endogenous p21 promoter, in agreement with the hypothesis that Tip60 functions as a co-activator for p53. Tip60 Knock-down Enhances p53 Degradation—When performing these experiments, we also observed that in cells transfected by the anti-Tip60 siRNAs, endogenous p53 levels were consistently decreased (although the effect is weak in the experiment shown in Fig. 2). Because this finding was unexpected, we first confirmed it using another anti-Tip60 siRNA. This siRNA also decreased Tip60 protein levels in a cell line stably expressing HA-tagged Tip60 (Fig. 3A). We found that Tip60 knock-down with either of the two anti-Tip60 siRNAs significantly and specifically decreased p53 protein levels compared with cells transfected by a control siRNA (Fig. 3B, upper panel). To rule out any nonspecific effects possibly leading to p53 stabilization by the control siRNA, we performed additional controls and found that the control siRNA (Fig. 3C, lane 4) did not induce accumulation of p53 compared with mock-transfected cells (lane 1), or cells transfected with another control siRNA (lane 2). The decrease in p53 levels upon Tip60 knock-down was most likely due to a destabilization of p53, since p53 mRNA levels were not affected by Tip60 knock-down (data not shown) and since Tip60 siRNA did not have any effect on p53 accumulation in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 3C, ALLN). Moreover, we found that the effect of Tip60 knock-down on p53 levels was observed only in unstressed cells, since upon actinomycin D treatment, it was no longer detectable (Fig. 3D, Act. D). Thus, taken together, these results indicate that endogenous Tip60 is involved in the control of p53 levels in normally growing cells by protecting p53 from proteasomal degradation. Tip60 Interferes with Mdm2-induced Degradation of p53—P53 levels in noninduced cells are largely controlled by Mdm2, which functions as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 thereby inducing its degradation through the proteasome. To test whether Tip60 is important for p53 expression by interfering with its Mdm2-induced degradation, we transfected U2OS cells with expression vectors for the various proteins, together with a CMV-luciferase reporter vector. After standardization according to luciferase activity for transfection efficiency and any nonspecific effect on the CMV promoter, total cell extracts were prepared by boiling cells directly in Laemmli sample buffer to ensure efficient extraction of all proteins. Then, the amount of exogenous p53 was determined by Western blot analysis. As expected, overexpression of Mdm2 led to a decrease in the steady state levels of transiently expressed p53, reflecting Mdm2-induced p53 degradation (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2). Co-expression of Tip60 resulted in a dose-dependent restoration of p53 levels, although it had no effect on the expression of a co-expressed HA-tagged Ku80 used as a control. Importantly, the effect of Tip60 was not due to a decrease in exogenous Mdm2 expression. On the contrary, Mdm2 steady-state levels were also increased by exogenous Tip60 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, Tip60 expression had no effect on p53 levels in the absence of exogenous Mdm2 (data not shown). Thus, taken together, these results indicate that Tip60 expression can antagonize the negative effects of Mdm2 on p53 expression. To demonstrate that Tip60 affects the stability of p53 in the presence of Mdm2, we used the DHFR-ubiquitin fusion protein system (22Levy F. Johnsson N. Rumenapf T. Varshavsky A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4907-4912Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This system takes advantage of the observation that, when a protein is expressed as an ubiquitin fusion protein, the N-terminal ubiquitin-containing part is co-translationally cleaved off by ubiquitin-specific proteases generating free ubiquitin (or in this case, DHFR-ubiquitin) and the protein of choice. Since the DHFR-ubiquitin moiety and the protein of choice (in this case p53 or Mdm2) are expressed as a fusion protein from the same transcript and, thus, have an identical transcription and translation rate, comparison of the relative levels of p53 with those of DHFR-ubiquitin allows to unambiguously determine if Tip60 affects Mdm2-induced degradation of p53. Using this system, we found that Mdm2 decreased p53 stability, as expected (Fig. 4B). Co-expression of Tip60 restored normal p53 levels without affecting DHFR-ubiquitin levels, demonstrating that Tip60 interferes with Mdm2-mediated degradation of p53. In addition, a similar analysis for Mdm2 showed that Mdm2 was also stabilized by Tip60 expression (Fig. 4C). Tip60 has been shown to physically interact with Mdm2 (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To investigate whether Tip60 inhibited Mdm2-induced degradation of p53 through physical interaction, we used two deletion mutants of Tip60 (Fig. 4D). We found that Tip60 259–396 (M2), which contains the minimal Mdm2 binding domain, was able to stabilize p53 in the presence of Mdm2, as well as Mdm2 itself (Note that the mutant is less efficient in stabilizing p53 than full-length Tip60, presumably because it is less well-expressed (right panel)). On the contrary, Tip60 131–258 (M1), which does not bind Mdm2 (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), did not significantly affect p53 or Mdm2 levels. Thus, the reversal of Mdm2-induced p53 degradation correlates with the ability of Tip60 to bind to Mdm2. Tip60 Affects p53 and Mdm2 Subcellular Localization—Tip60 is itself a substrate of Mdm2 ubiquitin ligase activity. Moreover, we did not find any effect of Tip60 on in vitro ubiquitylation of p53 by Mdm2 (data not shown). Finally, Fig. 4B results show that ubiquitinated forms of p53 seem also to be stabilized by Tip60 expression. Taken together, these findings suggest that Tip60 interferes with a subsequent step of p53 degradation rather than ubiquitination. This step could be nuclear export, since, although there is recent evidence that p53 degradation can occur to some extend in the nucleus (23Shirangi T.R. Zaika A. Moll U.M. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 420-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 24Xirodimas D.P. Stephen C.W. Lane D.P. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 270: 66-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), interfering with Mdm2 and p53 nuclear export clearly affects p53 degradation (25Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 26Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27Gottifredi V. Prives C. Science. 2001; 292: 1851-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We thus investigated the effect of Tip60 on p53 subcellular localization. Transfected p53 was always homogeneously nuclear (Fig. 5A, left panels). Co-expression of Mdm2 reduced p53 staining without affecting its localization (data not shown). Strikingly, in the presence of Mdm2 and Tip60, p53 appeared as dots in a significant proportion of transfected cells (about 50%) (right panels). This relocalization is likely to be mediated by physical recruitment of ectopically expressed p53 by exogenous Tip60, since when p53 staining appeared as dots, it always co-localized with Tip60 dots (Fig. 5B). Co-localization of Tip60 with PML indicates that these dots were actually PML bodies (Fig. 5C). Moreover, we found that exogenous Tip60 can also induce the relocalization of endogenous p53 to PML bodies (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data indicate that Tip60 affects p53 localization, in agreement with the possibility that it interferes with p53 degradation by affecting its nuclear export. Ternary Complex Formation between p53, Tip60, and Mdm2—Co-localization of p53 and Tip60 in PML bodies is only observed in the presence of Mdm2. Furthermore, Tip60 and p53 bind to different domains of Mdm2 (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 28Chen J. Marechal V. Levine A.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4107-4114Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). These data led us to hypothesize that Mdm2 could function as a bridge mediating a physical interaction between p53 and Tip60. To test this possibility, we performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected U2OS cells (Fig. 6A). We found that in the presence of expression vectors for p53, Tip60, and Mdm2, immunoprecipitation of p53 led to the co-immunoprecipitation of Tip60 (lane 2). This co-precipitation was specific, since Tip60 was not found in control immunoprecipitates (lane 4). However, in the absence of ectopically expressed Mdm2, co-precipitation of Tip60 with p53 was largely decreased (lane 1), although both proteins were nicely expressed (inputs, lower panel). These results indicate that p53 and Tip60 can physically associate in transfected cells in a Mdm2-dependent manner, in agreement with the possibility that Mdm2 functions as a bridge leading to the formation of a ternary complex. Furthermore, we found by immunofluorescence that exogenous (Fig. 6B) or endogenous Mdm2 (Fig. 6C) co-localized with Tip60 and p53 in PML bodies. Thus, taken together, these results suggest that Tip60 could form a ternary complex with Mdm2 and p53, thereby perhaps preventing them from being exported from the nucleus and subjected to proteasomal degradation. Role of Tip60 in the p53 Pathway—In this article, we provide evidence that Tip60 expression is required for a complete p53-dependent response. Indeed, it is required for p21 expression and G1/S checkpoint activation following actinomycin D-induced DNA damage (Fig. 1). Interestingly, such a role of Tip60 was already demonstrated following ionizing radiations (20Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar). What could be the mechanism by which Tip60 plays its role in the p53 pathway? We found that, following Tip60 knock-down, exogenous p53 was no longer able to activate p21 expression (Fig. 2), consistent with the possibility that Tip60 functions as a co-activator for p53 transcriptional activity. Note, however, that we cannot rule out the possibility that the effect of Tip60 is indirect: for example, it could be required for the expression of a p53 co-activator. Whatever the mechanism, Tip60 is an important cofactor for p53. Interestingly, we previously showed that Tip60 expression increases following DNA damage, in that case UV irradiation (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This increase could be important to adapt the levels of an important p53 co-factor with that of p53 itself. In this article, we also demonstrate another more unexpected role of Tip60. We found that it was able to inhibit Mdm2-induced degradation of p53, thereby allowing a basal expression of p53 in unstressed cells. Our observation is likely to be relevant since we obtained similar results using two different siRNAs (Fig. 3) and we found that Tip60 protects p53 from Mdm2-induced degradation when overexpressed (Fig. 4). However, these results stand in contrast to what was found by Berns et al. (20Berns K. Hijmans E.M. Mullenders J. Brummelkamp T.R. Velds A. Heimerikx M. Kerkhoven R.M. Madiredjo M. Nijkamp W. Weigelt B. Agami R. Ge W. Cavet G. Linsley P.S. Beijersbergen R.L. Bernards R. Nature. 2004; 428: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (927) Google Scholar) who did not find any decrease in p53 levels in cells stably expressing anti-Tip60 siRNAs. This discrepancy could be caused by a difference between transient inhibition of Tip60 expression (our study) or a stable inhibition (their study). Indeed, negative feedback loops (such as the Mdm2-dependent one) could restore normal levels of p53 in stably established cell lines. Alternatively, it is possible that a more efficient Tip60 inhibition should be achieved to detect an effect on p53 levels. Indeed, we consistently noticed that when the effect of Tip60 knock-down was not very strong, p53 basal levels were only weakly decreased (see for example Fig. 2). Mechanism of Tip60-mediated p53 Stabilization—What could be the mechanism by which Tip60 inhibits Mdm2-induced p53 degradation? Because it is itself a substrate of Mdm2 (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) and because it does not significantly affect Mdm2 E3 ligase activity toward p53 in vitro (data not shown), Tip60 does not seem to function through the inactivation of Mdm2 enzymatic activity (e.g. by interfering with the interaction of Mdm2 with its cognate E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes). We rather favor a mechanism in which Tip60 interferes with a subsequent step of Mdm2-induced p53 degradation. This step could be nuclear export of p53 and Mdm2, since nuclear export is required for p53 degradation (25Roth J. Dobbelstein M. Freedman D.A. Levine A.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 26Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3077-3080Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 27Gottifredi V. Prives C. Science. 2001; 292: 1851-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such a mechanism has already been proposed for p53 stabilization by p19ARF (29Tao W. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6937-6941Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, Tip60, when overexpressed, is able to change the subnuclear localization of endogenous Mdm2 and p53 (Figs. 5 and 6). Moreover, our result with Tip60 deletion mutants indicates that the effect of Tip60 involves the direct Tip60/Mdm2 interaction (Fig. 4). Although we have not proven it directly, it is tempting to speculate that stabilization of p53 by Tip60 involves the formation of a ternary complex between p53, Mdm2, and Tip60. Indeed, all three proteins co-localize in PML bodies (Figs. 5 and 6). Formation of a ternary complex between endogenous proteins is difficult to demonstrate, because it requires immunodepletion of one of the three components of the ternary complex. However, endogenous proteins are likely to form also this ternary complex since p53 and Mdm2 on one hand and Tip60 and Mdm2 on the other hand are known to interact at endogenous levels. Interestingly, we found that Tip60, which is a target of Mdm2 ubiquitination (18Legube G. Linares L.K. Lemercier C. Scheffner M. Khochbin S. Trouche D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1704-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), is also stabilized by p53 expression. 2G. Legube and D. Trouche, unpublished results. Taken together, these results thus suggest that Mdm2 induces the degradation of both p53 and Tip60, except when the three proteins are embedded in a ternary complex. A Function of the Ternary Tip60/p53/Mdm2 Complex in Transcription?—Our results also raise the intriguing possibility that a ternary Tip60/Mdm2/p53 complex could also be involved in transcriptional regulation, for example in allowing a rapid response to DNA damage or other kinds of stress. Indeed, since Mdm2 has been shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to bind p53-responsive promoters in the presence of p53 (30Jin Y. Zeng S.X. Dai M.S. Yang X.J. Lu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30838-30843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), it could be envisioned that Tip60, and thereby its HAT activity, is recruited to p53-responsive promoters before stress. Interestingly, and in perfect agreement with this hypothesis, Espinosa et al. (31Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar) found that p53 was bound to the p21 promoter and histone H4 was acetylated before promoter activation (31Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is thus tempting to speculate that the ternary complex we found here is bound to the p21 promoter, with Tip60 mediating histone acetylation and Mdm2 blocking a subsequent step of transcription activation. Such a mechanism would allow a rapid transcriptional response to signals activating p53 (31Espinosa J.M. Verdun R.E. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1015-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Indeed, most of such signals end up in the disruption of the p53-Mdm2 interaction. Promoter-bound p53 proteins would then be able to activate transcription immediately. Consistent with this idea, chromatic immunoprecipitation assay experiments ruled out the “latency model” for p53 DNA binding activity and demonstrated that p53 is perfectly able to bind to its target promoters in the absence of signaling (32Kaeser M.D. Iggo R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 95-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). An obvious question in this context is what would happen to Tip60 following disruption of the Mdm2/p53 interaction. Since Tip60 is probably a co-activator of p53 on the p21 promoter (Fig. 2), it is tempting to speculate that it would remain bound to the promoter in an Mdm2-independent manner and participate in transcriptional activation of p53 responsive genes. For example, it is possible that following stress, p53 or Tip60 are post-translationally modified in a manner allowing Mdm2-independent interactions between the two proteins. Consistent with this possibility, p53 acetylation, which is induced by DNA damage, allows the recruitment of TRRAP, a component of the Tip60 complex (33Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K.

https://openalex.org/W2011833766,"Rho family GTPases play pivotal roles in cytokinesis. By using probes based on the principle of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), we have shown that in HeLa cells RhoA activity increases with the progression of cytokinesis. Here we show that in Rat1A cells RhoA activity remained suppressed during most of the cytokinesis. Consistent with this observation, the expression of C3 toxin inhibited cytokinesis in HeLa cells but not in Rat1A cells. Furthermore, the expression of a dominant negative mutant of Ect2, a Rho GEF, or Y-27632, an inhibitor of the Rho-dependent kinase ROCK, inhibited cytokinesis in HeLa cells but not in Rat1A cells. In contrast to the activity of RhoA, the activity of Rac1 was suppressed during cytokinesis and started increasing at the plasma membrane of polar sides before the abscission of the daughter cells in both HeLa and Rat1A cells. This type of Rac1 suppression was shown to be essential for cytokinesis because a constitutively active mutant of Rac1 induced a multinucleated phenotype in both HeLa and Rat1A cells. Moreover, the involvement of MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 in this suppression of Rac1 during cytokinesis was shown by the use of a dominant negative mutant. Because ML-7, an inhibitor of myosin light chain kinase, delayed the cytokinesis of Rat1A cells and because Pak, a Rac1 effector, is known to suppress myosin light chain kinase, the suppression of the Rac1-Pak pathway by MgcRacGAP may play a pivotal role in the cytokinesis of Rat1A cells.

After chromosomal separation at the onset of anaphase, cytokinesis creates two daughter cells endowed with a complete set of chromosomes and cytoplasmic organelles. During this period, cortical actin and myosin II begin to move toward the equatorial region, where they form a contractile cleavage furrow (1Mabuchi I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 101: 175-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 3Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Rho family GTPases, which regulate a number of cell functions including gene expression and cell adhesion (4Bishop A.L. Hall A. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1666) Google Scholar), also play a pivotal role in cytokinesis (2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Benink H.A. Bement W.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among them, RhoA has been shown to be necessary for cytokinesis in a variety of cell types including Xenopus and sand dollar eggs (7Drechsel D.N. Hyman A.A. Hall A. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore (8Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J.

One RhoA effector, Rho kinase/ROCK, stimulates myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) 1The abbreviations used are: MLC, myosin II regulatory light chain; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; BrdUrd, bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; NRK, normal rat kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast.1The abbreviations used are: MLC, myosin II regulatory light chain; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; GAP, GTPase-activating protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; BrdUrd, bromo-2′-deoxyuridine; MLCK, myosin light chain kinase; NRK, normal rat kidney; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; DIC, differential interference contrast. directly by phosphorylation and indirectly by the inhibition of myosin phosphatase (10Amano M.

Yoshida T. Matsumura F. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 6059-6064Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Another RhoA effector, citron kinase, also phosphorylates and activates MLC (12Yamashiro S. Totsukawa G. Yamakita Y. Sasaki Y. Madaule P. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Matsumura F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 1745-1756Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation of MLC is believed to lead to actomyosin contractility and thereby to cytokinesis. However, the role of RhoA in cytokinesis may not be identical in adherent cells and in eggs or poorly adherent cells; well adherent NRK and Swiss 3T3 cells undergo cell division in the presence of an inhibitor of Rho, C3 ribosyltransferase, suggesting that cytokinesis may proceed by a RhoA-independent mechanism in some cell types (13O'Connell C.B. Wheatley S.P. Ahmed S. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition to RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have also been implicated in the cytokinesis of mammalian cells, based on the appearance of multinucleated cells among cells expressing constitutively active Rac1 or Cdc42 (14Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 367-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muris D. Verschoor T. Divecha N. Michalides R. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 1775-1782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In agreement with this view, it has been speculated that low microtubule density at the equatorial region leads to the suppression of Rac1 (6Mandato C.A. Benink H.A. Bement W.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This suppression of Rac1 activity down-regulates Pak, a kinase known to phosphorylate and thereby suppress MLCK (16Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Therefore, the suppression of Rac1 may also be involved in the contraction of the cleavage furrow. The activity of Rho family GTPases is regulated by the balance between guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs); GEF activates Rho by catalyzing the uptake of GTP, whereas GAP stimulates the GTPase activity of Rho, leading to its inactivation. Molecular and genetic studies have shown that a mammalian Rho GEF, ECT2, and its Drosophila melanogaster ortholog, Pebble (PBL), are required for cytokinesis (17Prokopenko S.N. Brumby A. O'Keefe L. Prior L. He Y. Saint R. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2301-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 18Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that these GEFs may be particularly important in the determination of the place and timing of cytokinesis (19Mishima M. Glotzer M. Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: R589-R591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Somers W.G. Saint R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). In addition to the GEFs, GAPs also appear to play a critical role during cytokinesis. A GAP for the Rho family GTPases, MgcRacGAP/CYK-4, is a component of the central spindlin complex, which bundles microtubules in the central spindle (20Somers W.G. Saint R. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 29-39Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 21Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J.

Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). The inhibition of MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 by mutants or RNA interference inhibits cytokinesis, inducing multinucleated cells (22Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 is 20–30-fold more active toward Rac1 and Cdc42 than toward RhoA (21Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), but becomes active toward RhoA upon phosphorylation by Aurora B (24Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T. Inagaki M. Kitamura T. Dev. Cell. 2003; 4: 549-560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). This MgcRacGAP/CYK-4-mediated RhoA suppression has been shown to be required for proper cortical activity during cytokinesis (25Lee J.S. Kamijo K. Ohara N. Kitamura T. Miki T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PRC1, a human spindle-associated cyclin-dependent kinase substrate, binds to and inhibits the Cdc42 GAP activity of MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 (26Ban R. Irino Y. Fukami K. Tanaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16394-16402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, at least three Rho family GTPases, RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, can function as potential targets of MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 during cytokinesis. Because the precise spatio-temporal regulation of the Rho family GTPases is critical for the progression of cytokinesis, it is necessary to visualize changes in the activity of these GTPases in living cells. To this end, we developed probes for the Rho family GTPases based on the principle of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) (27Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). By using these FRET-based probes, we have shown that the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 decrease upon entry into mitosis in HeLa cells (28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Although RhoA activity starts to increase after the initiation of cytokinesis, the activities of Rac1 and Cdc42 begin to increase at approximately the time of the abscission of daughter cells. Here we extended our previous study by using Rat1A cells in place of HeLa cells, and we demonstrated that RhoA activation at the onset of cytokinesis is not found in this cell type. In accord with this observation, the cytokinesis of Rat1A was not inhibited by inhibitors of RhoA. These observations indicate that the activation of and the requirement for RhoA during cytokinesis are cell type-specific. FRET Probes, Plasmids, and Recombinant Adenoviruses—The FRET probes, designated as Raichu-Rac1 and Raichu-RhoA, have been described previously (27Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The cDNAs for Rac1-V12 and Rac1-N17 were expressed from a pIRM21-FLAG expression vector containing a FLAG tag and an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the cDNA of a red fluorescent protein, dsFP593, at the 5′- and 3′-side of the cloning site, respectively (27Itoh R.E. Kurokawa K. Ohba Y. Yoshizaki H. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6582-6591Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). An expression vector of a dominant negative form of Ect2, Ect2-N, was obtained from T. Miki (National Institutes of Health). A dominant negative mutant of MgcRacGAP was obtained from T. Kitamura (Institute for Medical Sciences, University of Tokyo) and was subcloned into pERedMit, which, at the 3′-side of the cloning site, contained an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the cDNA of Express Red (BD Biosciences) fused to mitochondria-targeting signal. cDNA of Pak T423E mutant was obtained from G. M. Bokoch (The Scripps Research Institute) (29Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar) and subcloned into pERedNES, which contained an internal ribosomal entry site followed by the cDNA of Express Red fused to the nuclear export signal. Use of these two marker proteins with different targeting signals allows us to identify cells that express both of the expression plasmids. A recombinant adenovirus carrying C3 toxin cDNA, adeno-GFP-C3, and a control virus carrying GFP alone were obtained from H. Kurose (Kyusyu University, Fukuoka, Japan). Cells—HeLa and NIH3T3 cells were purchased from the Human Science Research Resources Bank (Sennan-shi, Japan) and from the RIKEN Gene Bank (Wako-shi, Japan), respectively. Rat1A and NRK cells were gifts from Y. Nakabeppu (Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan) and H. Okayama (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), respectively. HeLa, NIH3T3, and Rat1A cells were maintained in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS. NRK cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. Before cell imaging, DMEM was replaced with phenol red-free minimum Eagle's medium (Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) containing 10% FBS. FRET Imaging of Rho Family GTPases in Living Cells—FRET imaging was performed essentially as described previously (28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells plated on a collagen-coated 35-mm diameter glass-base dishes (Asahi Techno Glass Co., Tokyo, Japan) were transfected with Raichu expression vectors and imaged every 2 min on an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) that was equipped with a cooled CCD camera, CoolSNAP HQ (Roper Scientific, Trenton, NJ), and controlled by MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA) (30Miyawaki A. Llopis J. Heim R. McCaffery J.M. Adams J.A. Ikura M. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1997; 388: 882-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (2601) Google Scholar). For dual-emission ratio imaging of the Raichu probes, we used a 440AF21 excitation filter, a 455DRLP dichroic mirror, and two emission filters, 480AF30 for CFP and 535AF26 for YFP (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT). Cells were illuminated with a 75-watt xenon lamp through a 12% ND filter (Olympus Optical) and a 100× oil immersion objective lens. The exposure time was 0.5 s when the binning of the CCD camera was set to 4 × 4. After background subtraction, the ratio image of YFP/CFP was created with MetaMorph software and was used to represent the efficiency of the FRET. Roles of Rho Family GTPases in Cytokinesis—Cells were infected with recombinant adenoviruses carrying GFP or GFP-C3. Thirty six hours later, the cells were labeled with BrdUrd (Sigma) for 12 h. After fixation with 70% ethanol, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Tween 20, followed by incubation in PBS containing 30 μg/ml DNase I (Roche Diagnostics) for 1 h. BrdUrd incorporated into the nucleus was detected with anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences), followed by Alexa 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). More than 100 cells that were positive for both BrdUrd and GFP were analyzed to identify the multinucleated phenotype. In other experiments, the cells were transfected with pIRM21-derived expression plasmids of Rho family GTPases or pERed-derived expression plasmids, and 48 h later, the cells expressing marker proteins were analyzed to identify the multinucleated phenotype. Microinjection of C3 Toxin—The cDNA of C3 toxin was inserted into pGEX-6P (Amersham Biosciences). The purification of C3 was performed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, glutathione S-transferase-fused C3 was purified on a glutathione-Sepharose column from the cell lysates of Escherichia coli expressing pGEX-6P-C3. C3 was excised from glutathione S-transferase with PreScission protease, followed by dialysis against PBS. Cells in the metaphase were microinjected with 0.1 mg/ml C3 in PBS or with PBS alone and were analyzed to identify the multinucleated phenotype as described previously (13O'Connell C.B. Wheatley S.P. Ahmed S. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Effect of Kinase Inhibitors on Cytokinesis—Cells were treated with 40 μm Y-27632 (Calbiochem) for 4 h, 40 μm ML-7 (Calbiochem) for 5 min, or 100 μm blebbistatin (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc., North York, Ontario, Canada) for 1 min. Then, in the continuing presence of the inhibitors, cells in metaphase were identified, and such cells were recorded by DIC images created every 30 s in the case of the Rat1a cells and every 1 min in the case of the HeLa cells. By using these DIC images, the diameter of the contractile ring was measured and plotted to obtain the time course. Each time course was fitted to an exponential curve with GraFit software (Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK), by which the maximum velocity and the half-time (τ ½) of cleavage furrow contraction were calculated. Changes in the Activity of RhoA and Rac1 in Rat1A Cells Progressing from the G2 to the G1 Phase—To examine whether the changes in the activity of RhoA and Rac1 described in HeLa cells could be generalized to other cell types, we monitored spatio-temporal changes in the activities of RhoA and Rac1 by using Rat1A cells progressing from the G2 to the G1 phase, as described previously (28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Briefly, Rat1A cells expressing Raichu-RhoA or Raichu-Rac1 were excited at 440 nm and imaged for CFP and YFP at 475 and 530 nm, respectively. The intensity ratio YFP/CFP was used to represent the FRET efficiency of the probes, which reflects the GTP/GDP ratio on each probe. Because Raichu probes are regulated in a manner similar to that of authentic GTPases, the FRET value at each pixel of the digital image reflects the activity of the corresponding GTPase (28Yoshizaki H. Ohba Y. Kurokawa K. Itoh R.E. Nakamura T. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Images of differential interference contrast and YFP-tagged actin were also obtained to follow the morphological changes. At prophase, the activities of RhoA and Rac1 started decreasing, reaching a nadir at telophase, and gradually increased upon exit from the M phase (Fig. 1A). The activities were then averaged for the entire region of each Rat1A cell and compared with those of HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). RhoA activity started increasing at late telophase in Rat1A cells, whereas it did so in anaphase in the HeLa cells. The time course of the change in the activity of Rac1 was very similar between Rat1A cells and HeLa cells. In order to follow changes in activity over a long period of ∼16 h, the objective lens was focused on the basal plasma membrane before imaging and was fixed during the entire experiment. Thus, upon the rounding of the cells during mitosis, the images always became out of focus. To obtain clearer images, we looked for cells that had entered into mitosis, and we acquired their images by continuously focusing the lens at the middle depth of the cells (Fig. 2A). The progression of cytokinesis was followed by measuring the breadth of the cells at the cleavage furrow. The averaged RhoA activity increased, whereas the constriction proceeded in HeLa cells, and in Rat1A cells, RhoA activity reached a nadir in the late phase of cytokinesis, slightly before the appearance of the mitotic midbody. We performed similar experiments with NRK and NIH3T3 cells and found that NRK cells behaved in a manner similar to that of HeLa cells, whereas NIH3T3 cells behaved in a manner similar to that of Rat1A cells (Fig. 2B). These observations suggest that the role of RhoA in cytokinesis is cell type-specific.Fig. 2Changes in the activity of RhoA during cytokinesis. A, HeLa cells or Rat1A cells expressing Raichu-RhoA were photographed as in Fig. 1A, except that the fluorescent images were focused on the contour of the cells and subjected to median filtering in order to reduce noise. The elapsed time and the phases are denoted at the top of the figure. Time zero is set to metaphase. B, the net intensities of YFP and CFP in each cell were measured in order to calculate the average emission ratio. The progression of cytokinesis was monitored by a decrease in the diameter of the contractile ring (CR). The abscissa shows the diameter of contractile ring in arbitrary units (A.U.), the value of which varies from 1 at the initiation to 0 at the end of cytokinesis. NRK cells and NIH3T3 cells expressing Raichu-RhoA were imaged, and the emission ratio (YFP/CFP) was obtained as in A. Bars indicate error bars from five cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The changes in the activity of Rac1 were indistinguishable among HeLa, Rat1A, NRK, and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 3). Suppression of Rac1 activity was most prominent at the cleavage furrow, and the increase in activity was initiated at the polar ends of the plasma membrane in both cell types. Inhibition of Cytokinesis of HeLa and NRK Cells but Not of Rat1A and NIH3T3 Cells by C3—The lack of increase in RhoA activity during cytokinesis suggested its dispensability in the cytokinesis of Rat1A cells and NIH3T3 cells. To address this issue, we examined the effect of C3 toxin on cytokinesis. The effectiveness of C3 toxin delivered by a recombinant adenovirus was first confirmed by the loss of actin stress fibers in both HeLa and Rat1A cells. 2H. Yoshizaki and M. Matsuda, unpublished results. To exclude cells that were G1-arrested by the inactivation of Rho family GTPases (31Welsh C.F. Roovers K. Villanueva J. Liu Y. Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 950-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), we stained the cells with BrdUrd, and we determined the number of multinucleated cells among those positive for both BrdUrd and GFP (Fig. 4A). The expression of GFP-C3 significantly induced the multinucleated phenotype in more than 50% of the HeLa cells but only in 10% of the Rat1A cells and 18% of the NIH3T3 cells. We could not perform a similar experiment by using NRK cells because of the toxicity of the recombinant adenovirus carrying GFP-C3 to this cell type. Therefore, we examined the effect of C3 by microinjecting purified C3 toxin into the cytoplasm at metaphase (Fig. 4B). Cytokinesis was remarkably inhibited in HeLa and NRK cells and was slightly disturbed in Rat1A cells by this manipulation. These results suggest that the requirement of RhoA for cytokinesis was less flexible in HeLa and NRK cells than in Rat1A cells and NIH3T3 cells. O'Connell et al. (13O'Connell C.B. Wheatley S.P. Ahmed S. Wang Y.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) have shown that the microinjection of C3 inhibits cytokinesis in HeLa cells but not in NRK cells and Swiss 3T3 cells. The discrepancy regarding the effects on NRK cells may have been due to the difference in the origin of NRK cells, the culturing conditions, or the concentration of C3. In any case, the effect of C3 on cytokinesis appeared to be dependent on the cellular context. Role of the Suppression of Rac1 Activity in Cytokinesis—Next, we addressed the role of the suppression of Rac1 during cytokinesis. To this end, we expressed constitutively active or dominant negative mutants of Rac1 (Fig. 5A). The expression of Rac1-G12V significantly increased the number of multinucleated cells in both HeLa and Rat1A cells. This observation agreed with the results of previous reports, i.e. it was found that constitutively active Rac1 induced multinucleated cells in HeLa and porcine aortic endothelial cells (14Dutartre H. Davoust J. Gorvel J.P. Chavrier P. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 367-377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Muris D. Verschoor T. Divecha N. Michalides R. Eur. J. Cancer. 2002; 38: 1775-1782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In contrast to the constitutively active mutant, Rac1-T17N did not increase the number of multinucleated cells to a detectable level. This observation again agreed with those of previous reports (2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 21Jantsch-Plunger V. Gonczy P. Romano A. Schnabel H. Hamill D. Schnabel R. Hyman A.A. Glotzer M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1391-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) showing that a loss of the function of Rac1 did not inhibit cytokinesis. Among many effector molecules of Rac1, Pak may be involved in the regulation of cytokinesis. Microinjection of Pak inhibits cleavage furrow ingression of Xenopus egg (32Rooney R.D. Tuazon P.T. Meek W.E. Carroll E.J. Hagen J.J. Gump E.L. Monnig C.A. Lugo T. Traugh J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21498-21504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Pak phosphorylates and thereby inhibits MLCK (16Sanders L.C. Matsumura F. Bokoch G.M. de Lanerolle P. Science. 1999; 283: 2083-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 33Bokoch G.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 743-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar), which is known to promote cytokinesis through phosphorylation of myosin II (34Poperechnaya A. Varlamova O. Lin P.J. Stull J.T. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 697-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). We found that expression of a constitutively active Pak1 mutant, Pak-T423E, significantly increased the number of multinucleated cells both in HeLa and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, a decrease in Rac1 activity and the resulting suppression of Pak1 appear to be essential steps of cytokinesis in a variety of cell types. Inhibition of Cytokinesis by Dominant Negative Mutants of Ect2 and MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 —We further studied the mechanism of changes in the activity of Rho family GTPases during cytokinesis. For this purpose, we utilized dominant negative mutants of Ect2 and MgcRacGAP/CYK-4, which have been shown to regulate cytokinesis (18Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 22Hirose K. Kawashima T. Iwamoto I. Nosaka T. Kitamura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5821-5828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 23Mishima M. Kaitna S. Glotzer M. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 41-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 25Lee J.S. Kamijo K. Ohara N. Kitamura T. Miki T. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 293: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the dominant negative mutant of Ect2, Ect2-N, the increase in RhoA activity was suppressed at the cleavage furrow but not at the plasma membrane of polar sides (Fig. 6A). This observation agrees with the previously demonstrated recruitment of Ect2 to the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (18Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and suggests that multiple Rho GEFs are activated during cytokinesis. In cells expressing the dominant negative mutant of MgcRacGAP, MgcRacGAP-RA, Rac1 activity was not decreased at the cleavage furrow of HeLa cells, indicating that the suppression of Rac1 activity during cytokinesis was primarily mediated by the recruitment of MgcRacGAP (Fig. 6B). To determine the effect of these mutants on cytokinesis quantitatively, we scored the number of multinucleated cells in the presence or absence of GFP-Ect2-N or MgcRacGAP-RA (Fig. 6C). Both GFP-Ect2-N and MgcRacGAP-RA increased the number of the multinucleated cells in HeLa cells. The effect of these mutants on Rat1A cells was marginal in this assay. Therefore, to examine the effect of these mutants on cytokinesis more directly, we measured the diameter of the contractile ring as shown by DIC images created during cytokinesis, and we calculated the maximum velocity of its shortening and the half-time of cytokinesis. The half-life of the shortening of the contractile ring was 7.2 min in the HeLa cells and 4.7 min in the Rat1A cells (Fig. 6D). In the presence of GFP-Ect2-N and MgcRacGAP-RA, the half-life of the shortening of the contractile ring was increased to 9.6 and 11.2 min, respectively, in HeLa cells (Fig. 6E). In Rat1A cells, however, only MgcRacGAP-RA increased the half-life of the contractile ring shortening to 7.1 min. These observations suggest the following conclusions. First, the increase in RhoA activity at the cleavage furrow of HeLa cells was primarily mediated by Ect2. Second, the decrease in Rac1 activity at the cleavage furrow was primarily mediated by MgcRacGAP. Third, the activation of RhoA was not essential for the cytokinesis of Rat1A cells. Fourth, in Rat1A cells, suppression of Rac1 plays a more critical role in cytokinesis than activation of RhoA. Recently, it has been shown that increases in RhoA activity are responsible for cortical rigidity (35Maddox A.S. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Diffuse increases in RhoA activity at the plasma membrane may play a role in this increased cortical rigidity. However, the results obtained with GFP-Ect2-N seem to indicate that such an increase at the cortex is not sufficient for cytokinesis, unless it is accompanied by an increase in RhoA activity at the cleavage furrow. More importantly, these results demonstrated that the inhibition of cytokinesis by C3 or GFP-Ect2-N in each cell type was closely correlated with an increase in RhoA activity during cytokinesis, as observed by the Raichu probes used here. Notably, our observations are not necessarily in conflict with the recent finding that MgcRacGAP/CYK-4 phosphorylated by Aurora B acts on RhoA at the time of the abscission of daughter cells (24Minoshima Y. Kawashima T. Hirose K. Tonozuka Y. Kawajiri A. Bao Y.C. Deng X. Tatsuka M. Narumiya S. May W.S. Nosaka T. Semba K. Inoue T. Satoh T. Inagaki M. Kitamura T. Dev.

Cell Res. 2004; 293: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Because of the limitation in the resolution of the FRET images, we were unable to conclude whether or not RhoA was suppressed at the spindle midbody at the time of abscission. Role of ROCK and MLCK on the Cytokinesis of HeLa and Rat1A Cells—To understand further the role of Rho family GTPases in the cytokinesis of HeLa and Rat1A cells, we tested the effects of various inhibitors that have been shown to disturb cytokinesis. First, we tested the effects of blebbistatin, an inhibitor of myosin II (36Straight A.F. Cheung A. Limouze J. Chen I. Westwood N.J. Sellers J.R. Mitchison T.J. Science. 2003; 299: 1743-1747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1107) Google Scholar), because cytokinesis can proceed in a myosin II-independent manner in Dictyostelium discoideum (37Gerisch G. Weber I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 126-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, blebbistatin abrogated the cytokinesis of both HeLa and Rat1A cells. Thus, we proceeded to examine the contribution of ROCK and MLCK, which can induce actomyosin contraction by the phosphorylation of the light chain of myosin II (2Glotzer M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 351-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). To this end, we treated the cells with Y27632, an inhibitor of ROCK, or ML-7, an inhibitor of MLCK. In HeLa cells, the effect of ML-7 was insignificant, whereas Y-27632 markedly delayed the velocity of cleavage furrow ingression, as reported previously (38Kosako H. Goto H. Yanagida M. Matsuzawa K. Fujita M. Tomono Y. Okigaki T. Odai H. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2783-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In contrast, ML-7, but not Y27632 significantly inhibited the cleavage furrow ingression of Rat1A cells. Therefore, a relief of Pak suppression seemed to lead to MLCK-promoted cytokinesis in Rat1A cells, as suggested previously (6Mandato C.A. Benink H.A. Bement W.M. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2000; 45: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). One of our co-authors (39Dulyaninova N.G. Patskovsky Y.V. Bresnick A.R. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 1481-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) has recently reported an essential role of MLCK in the normal spindle morphology and chromosomal alignment of mitotic HeLa cells by using dominant negative mutants of MLCK. In these HeLa cells expressing the dominant negative MLCK mutants, the frequency of the multinucleated cells was up to 11%, whereas the percentage of multinucleated cells exceeded 50% in the presence of C3 (Fig. 4). In addition, the effect of the dominant negative mutants of MLCK on the velocity of cleavage furrow ingression was markedly weaker than that of Y-27632 (supplemental figure). Therefore, we concluded that the effect on MLCK was prominent in metaphase but less remarkable during cytokinesis in HeLa cells. Altogether, cytokinesis of HeLa cells seems to be more resistant to the inhibition of MLCK than Rat1A cells. In conclusion, this study revealed that there are at least two pathways leading to actomyosin contraction and the resulting constriction of the cleavage furrow. The contribution of each pathway may depend on the cellular context. For example, the Ect2-RhoA-ROCK pathway is predominant in HeLa cells, whereas the MgcRacGAP/CYK-4-Rac1-Pak-MLCK pathway plays a more important role in the cytokinesis of Rat1A cells. Such differences in the mechanism of cytokinesis may in turn have generated the observed discrepancy in the requirement of RhoA for cytokinesis. Note Added in Proof—Following acceptance of this manuscript, a complementary study was published that provides further genetic support for our proposal that MgcRacGAP/CYK-4/RacGAP50C suppresses Rac during cytokinesis (D'Avino, P. P., Savoian, M. S., and Glover, D. M. (2004) J. Cell Biol. 166, 61–71). We thank T. Miki, T. Kitamaura, H. Kurose, J. Miyazaki, Y. Nakabeppu, G. M. Bokoch, and H.

https://openalex.org/W1992887797,"Previously we have shown that ASK-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, also known as DAB2IP), a novel member of the Ras-GAP protein family, mediates TNF-induced activation of ASK1-JNK signaling pathway. However, the mechanism by which TNF signaling is coupled to AIP1 is not known. Here we show that AIP1 is localized on the plasma membrane in resting endothelial cells (EC) in a complex with TNFR1. TNF binding induces release of AIP1 from TNFR1, resulting in cytoplasmic translocation and concomitant formation of an intracellular signaling complex comprised of TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and AIPl. A proline-rich region (amino acids 796–807) is critical for maintaining AIP1 in a closed form, which associates with a region of TNFR1 distinct from the death domain, the site of TNFR1 association with TRADD. An AIP1 mutant with deletion of this proline-rich region constitutively binds to TRAF2 and ASK1. A PERIOD-like domain (amino acids 591–719) of AIP1 binds to the intact RING finger of TRAF2, and specifically enhances TRAF2-induced ASK1 activation. At the same time, the binding of AIP1 to TRAF2 inhibits TNF-induced IKK-NF-κB signaling. Taken together, our data suggest that AIP1 is a novel transducer in TNF-induced TRAF2-dependent activation of ASK1 that mediates a balance between JNK versus NF-κB signaling. Previously we have shown that ASK-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, also known as DAB2IP), a novel member of the Ras-GAP protein family, mediates TNF-induced activation of ASK1-JNK signaling pathway.

Killeen N. Lenardo M.J. Cell. 2001; 104: 487-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3018) Google Scholar). Vascular endothelial cells (EC) are among the principal physiological targets of TNF (2Madge L.A. Pober J.S. Exp. Mol. Pathol. 2001; 70: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In EC, as in other cell types, TNF elicits a broad spectrum of biological effects including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. TNF signals are initiated by binding to either of two different cell surface receptors, known as TNFR1 (CD122a) and TNFR2 (CD122b). The bestcharacterized signaling pathways are initiated by TNFR1. A current model postulates that in the absence of TNF, TNFR1 is kept in an inactive state through binding of an adaptor protein called silencer of death-domains (SODD). The interaction between TNFR1 and SODD is mediated by association of death domains on both proteins. TNF induces dissociation of SODD from TNFR1 with concomitant recruitment of TNFR-associated death-domain protein (TRADD) (3Hsu H. Xiong J. Goeddel D.V. Cell. 1995; 81: 495-504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar, 4Jiang Y. Woronicz J.D. Liu W. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1999; 283: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). TRADD functions as a platform adaptor to initiate assembly of a multiprotein complex that activates downstream signaling pathways. Specifically, TRADD recruits both receptor-interacting protein-1 (RIP1) and TNFR-associated factor (TRAF2), which in turn recruit the IκB kinase complex (IKK) and a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), leading to activation of NF-κB and JNK pathways, respectively (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 6Baud V. Karin M.

Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Recently it has been proposed that TNFR1-TRADD-RIP-TRAF2 complex function as an initial membrane bound complex (complex I) to specifically activate the NF-κB cascade. The role of the complex I in the JNK cascade has not been addressed (8Varfolomeev E.E. Ashkenazi A. Cell. 2004; 116: 491-497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Complex I is rapidly internalized and TRADD rapidly dissociates from TNFR1. After a lag of some several hours, internalized TRADD may recruit Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and procaspase-8 to form a cytoplasmic complex (complex II). Complex II promotes autocatalytic activation of pro-caspase-8 to initiate apoptosis unless the NF-κB-induced long isoform of the component known as FLICE inhibitory protein (FLIPL) is also present in the complex (9Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). The events between the dissociation of complex I and the formation of complex II are not well established. TRAF2 is a member of a family of signal transducing proteins. Six members of TRAF family have been extensively studied (10Bradley J.R. Pober J.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6482-6491Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar) and TRAF7 has been recently described (11Bouwmeester T. Bauch A. Ruffner H. Angrand P.O. Bergamini G. Croughton K. Cruciat C. Eberhard D. Gagneur J. Ghidelli S. Hopf C. Huhse B. Mangano R. Michon A.M. Schirle M. Schlegl J. Schwab M. Stein M.A. Bauer A. Casari G. Drewes G. Gavin A.C. Jackson D.B. Joberty G. Neubauer G. Rick J. Kuster B. Superti-Furga G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). JNK and NF-κB pathways can be activated by overexpression of TRAF 2, 5, and 6, but not of TRAF 1, 3, and 4, suggesting that different TRAFs, despite their structural homology, might perform very different functions. Studies from various cell types have identified TRAF2 as the bifurcation of two different kinase cascades leading to activation of NF-κB and JNK: TRADD-TRAF2/RIP-IKK for NF-κB activation, and TRADD-TRAF2-MAP3K-MAP2K for JNK activation (5Wajant H. Pfizenmaier K. Scheurich P. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 45-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar, 6Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1376) Google Scholar). Recent studies of TRAF2 knockout mice or transgenic mice expressing dominant negative TRAF2 mutant protein have established that TRAF2 is absolutely required for activation of JNK by TNF, although it may be redundant in some cell types for NF-κB activation (12Lee S.Y.

Studies in transfected cells have shown that the intact RING finger of TRAF2 is critical for TRAF2 function since a TRAF2 mutant with deletion of the N terminus (87–501) behaves as a dominant negative mutant for both NF-κB and JNK activation (15Takeuchi M. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19935-19942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The TRAF2 gene may code for an alternatively spliced form, designated as TRAF-2A, which differs from TRAF2 in that it contains a seven amino acids insertion in its RING domain (16Brink R. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4129-4134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). TRAF-2A fails to activate NF-κB pathway while still retains an ability to activate the JNK pathway (17Dadgostar H. Cheng G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24775-24780Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). These results suggest that NF-κB and JNK pathways may be differentially regulated by minor alterations in the effector domain of TRAF2 or by modulators that bind to different sites on the TRAF2 RING finger. The mechanism by which TRAFs activates MAP3Ks remains unclear, and there is some disagreement about which MAP3K is critical for JNK activation. It has been shown that the TRAF domain of TRAF2 and TRAF6 interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a member of the MAP3K family that specifically activates a cascade ending with JNK (but not NF-κB) activation. The association of TRAFs with ASK1 is required for ASK1 activation (18Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K. Nakano H. Rothe M. Miyazono K. Ichijo H. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 389-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). ASK1 is a 170-kDa protein containing an inhibitory N-terminal domain, an internal kinase domain, and the C-terminal domain interacting with TRAFs (18Nishitoh H. Saitoh M. Mochida Y. Takeda K.

The current model for ASK1 activation by TNF involves several critical steps including release of inhibitors (thioredoxin and 14-3-3) (20Saitoh M. Nishitoh H. Fujii M. Takeda K. Tobiume K. Sawada Y.

We have recently shown that TNF can induce a TRAF2-dependent association of ASK1 with ASK-interacting protein 1 (AIP1, also called DAB2IP for DAB2-interacting protein), a novel member of the Ras-GAP family (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 25Guicciardi M.E. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1813-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). AIP1 causes 14-3-3 release from ASK1, initiating ASK1-dependent JNK activation (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that AIP1 is localized to the plasma membrane of EC where it associates with TNFR1 through a site distinct from the death domain involved in SODD and TRADD binding. In response to TNF, AIP1 dissociates from TNFR1 with concomitant cytoplasmic translocation and formation of a complex comprised of TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, and AIP1, which is distinct from the complex I and complex II and which initiates specific activation of the ASK1-JNK pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AIP1 specifically interacts with the effector domain RING finger of TRAF2 to enhance TNF-induced ASK1-JNK but to inhibit IKK-NF-κB signaling. Our data suggest that AIP1 is a novel transducer of TRAF2 in TNF-induced ASK1-JNK signaling.

Luciferase activity followed by Renilla activity was measured twice in duplicate using a Berthold luminometer. All data were normalized as relative luciferase light units/Renilla unit. Isolation of Caveolae-enriched Membranes—Purification of caveolae-enriched membrane fractions was performed as described (29Sargiacomo M. Sudol M. Tang Z. Lisanti M.P. J.

In brief, EAhy.926 cells were treated with 10 ng/ml TNF for the indicated time point, washed twice with ice-cold Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 1 ml of MBS (25 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 0,2% Triton X-100) with protease 15 inhibitors (10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc) and left 20 min on ice. The suspension was subjected to 10–15 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and centrifuged for 10 min at 2000 rpm at 4 °C to remove high density debris. Clarified post-nuclear supernatants were combined with 90% (w/v) sucrose prepared in MES, transferred to the bottom of a Beckman 12.5 ml ultracentrifuge tubes and overlaid gently with 6 ml of 35% and 3 ml of 5% sucrose respectively. The resulting 5–40% discontinuous sucrose gradients were centrifuged 18–20 h at 40,000 rpm in a SW41 Beckman rotor at 4 °C to allow the separation of the low density rafts/caveolae. After centrifugation, a floating light band, corresponding to the Triton X-100 insoluble material, was detectable at the interface between 35 and 5% of each gradient. Fractions were harvested from the top to the bottom of the gradients and analyzed either by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for caveolin-1, TNFR1, TRAF2, or AIP1 or for binding of cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) by dot blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—EAhy926 cells or BAEC after various treatments were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in 1.5 ml of cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.75% Brij 96, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA) for 20 min on ice. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin.

(Reamstown, PA) (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Anti-TRAF2, anti-TRADD, anti-RIP1, anti-ASK1, and anti-GST were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-TNFR1 was purchased from R&D System. Anti-FLAG (M2) was from Sigma. Indirect Immunofluorescence Confocal Microscopy—Fixation, permeabilization, and staining of cultured EC were performed as described previously (27Min W. Bradley J.R. Galbraith J.J. Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 319-324PubMed Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 488 (green) or 594 (red) conjugated-secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus confocal microscope and acquired images were transferred to Photoshop 6.0 to generate the final figures. TNF Induces a Translocation of AIP1 from Plasma Membrane to Cytoplasm in EC—We have recently shown that AIP1/DAB2IP is highly expressed in EC but not in several common tumor cell lines including human prostate cancer and breast cancer cell lines (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 30Chen H. Toyooka S. Gazdar A.F. Hsieh J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3121-3130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). AIP1 contains a pleckstrin homology (PH) and a PKC-conserved region 2 (C2), two motifs implicated in plasma membrane targeting. To determine if AIP1 is localized on EC plasma membrane, we first examined AIP1 localization in resting BAEC by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy with an anti-AIP1 antibody. AIP1 showed a distinct plasma membrane staining (Fig. 1a, top panel). Control staining with a normal rabbit serum did not show any staining. To further approve AIP1 membrane localization, an EC membrane protein CD31 was used as a positive control. AIP1 and CD31 showed co-localization on EC (Fig. 1a, bottom panel). AIP1 also showed plasma membrane localization in cultured HUVEC (not shown). To determine the critical domain for AIP1 for membrane localization, BAEC were transiently transfected with expression constructs for FLAG-tagged AIP1 containing various domains (AIP1-F for the full-length, AIP1-N for the N-terminal domain containing the PH, C2, and GAP domains, AIP1-PHC2, AIP1-PH, AIP1-ΔPH for the mutant with a deletion of the PH domain, and AIP1-C for the C-terminal domain). AIP1-F, AIP1-N, and PHC2 are predominantly localized on membrane vesicles (or microdomains). AIP1-PH showed plasma membrane as well as cytoplasm with no detectable vesicles, and AIP1-PH also caused elongation of cells. In contrast, AIP1-C and AIP1-ΔPH are detected in the cytoplasm, suggesting that the PH and C2 domain are critical for AIP1 localization in membrane microdomains (Fig. 1b). Previously we have shown that TNF induces association of AIP1 with ASK1, which is predominantly localized in cytoplasm, raising the possibility that TNF might induce a translocation of AIP1 from plasma membrane to cytoplasm. To test this hypothesis, HUVEC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml) for various time points (0, 5, 15, 30, and 60 min) and localization of AIP1 was determined as described. TNF treatment for 15 min induces a translocation of AIP1 from plasma membrane to cytoplasm. However, AIP1 returned to plasma membrane at 60 min of post-treatment with TNF (Fig. 1c). The kinetics of internalization is similar to that of TNF-induced AIP1-ASK1 association and ASK1-JNK activation (Ref. 24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, also see Fig. 2). These data suggest that TNF-induced AIP1 internalization correlates with formation of AIP1-ASK1 complex and activation of ASK1. TNF Induces Release of AIP1 from TNFR1 with Concomitant Formation of AIP1 Complex (TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2-AIP1-ASK1) in EC—The membrane localization and rapid movement of AIP1 in EC prompted us to examine association of AIP1 with TNFR1 signaling components including TNFR1, TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2. We found that AIP1 and TNFR1 are abundant in human EC cell line EAhy926 and we chose EAhy926 to determine endogenous AIP1-TNFR1 complexes. EC were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml for 0, 15, and 60 min) and association of AIP1 with TNFR1 signaling components by co-immunoprecipitation assays. TNF treatment did not alter protein expression of TNFR1, TRADD, RIP1, TRAF2, AIP1, or ASK1 (Fig. 2a). AIP1-TNFR1 complex is readily detected in resting EC. In response to TNF, AIP1 is dissociated from TNFR1 at 15 min but reassociates with TNFR1 at 60 min (Fig. 2b), consistent with the kinetics of AIP1 translocation. Formation of AIP1-SODD complex shows a similar kinetics as that of AIP1-TNFR1 complex (not shown). In contrast, TNF treatment induced a strong interaction of AIP1 with TRADD, RIP1, and TRAF2 at 15 min, which declined by 60 min of treatment (Fig. 2b). Association of TRAF2 and AIP1 with ASK1 as well as ASK1 activation show a similar kinetics (Fig. 2c). These data suggest that TNF induces formation of a complex comprising of TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2-AIP1-ASK1 (so named AIP1 complex) in EC. Furthermore, we determined kinetics of TNFR1-TRADD complex, which peaks at 2 min, declines at 5 min and disappears by 15 min (Fig. 2d), consistent with previous studies of HUVEC (31Jones S.J. Ledgerwood E.C. Prins J.B. Galbraith J. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. Bradley J.R. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 1042-1048PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly AIP1, which associates with the unactivated TNFR1 molecule, is absent in the TNFR1-TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2 complex (complex I), which assembles on the plasma membrane and has been shown to trigger activation of NF-κB pathway (9Micheau O. Tschopp J. Cell. 2003; 114: 181-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2013) Google Scholar). EAhy926 displays an extensive caveolar system, which has been shown to be critical for signaling by TNFR1 and TRAF2 (32Legler D.F. Micheau O. Doucey M.A. Tschopp J. Bron C. Immunity. 2003; 18: 655-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 33Arron J.R. Pewzner-Jung Y. Walsh M.C. Kobayashi T. Choi Y. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 196: 923-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To determine if AIP1 complex is localized in caveolae, EAhy926 were treated with TNF (10 ng/ml for 15) and cell fractionations (fractions 1–10) by sucrose gradient centrifugation following Dounce homogenization in Triton X-100 buffer. In resting EC, the majority of TNFR1 is detected in fractions 10 containing heavy membranes and a small portion of TNFR1 can be detected in fractions 4–5 where caveolin-1 is typically distributed. TNF decreases distribution of TNFR1 in fractions 4–5 at 15 min (Fig. 2e). TRAF2 is also detected in caveolae fractions in both resting and TNF-treated EC. However, AIP1 is only detected in fractions 10, but not in other fractions, suggesting that AIP1 is not localized in caveolae (Fig. 2e). Similar to AIP1, TRADD, RIP1, and ASK1 were not detected in caveolae fractions (Fig. 2e). Taken together, these data suggest that that AIP1 associates with TNFR1 in resting EC whereas associates with TRADD-RIP1-TRAF2-ASK1 in TNF-treated EC in different membrane microdomains other than caveolae. AIP1 in a Closed Inactive Form Associates with TNFR1 Whereas in an Open Active Form Binds to TRAF2/ASK1—We have previously shown that in resting EC AIP1 is retained in a closed conformation by intramolecular interactions and AIP1 associates with ASK1 only after the disruption of these intramolecular interactions (24Zhang R. He X. Liu W. Lu M. Hsieh J.T. Min W. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 1933-1943Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). To define the critical domains for AIP1 intramolecular loop formation, we first generated deletion constructs of AIP1 at the N terminus or the C terminus (AIP1-ΔPH with a deletion of the N-terminal PH, amino acids 81–1056), AIP1-ΔLZ with deletion of the C-terminal LZ motif, amino acids 1–910), and AIP1-ΔPR with a deletion of the PR region, amino acids 1–796) (Fig. 3a). EC were transfected with various AIP1 mutants, and association of ASK1 with various AIP1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assays. AIP1-ΔPR, but not AIP1-F, AIP1-ΔPH or AIP1-ΔLZ, binds to ASK1 in the absence of TNF (Fig. 3b, +TNF). However, TNF treatment (10 ng/ml for 15 min) induced association of ASK1 with these AIP1 proteins (Fig. 3b, –TNF). These data suggest that the PR region, but not the LZ motif or the PH domain, is a critical domain in retaining AIP1 in a closed inactive form. Association of AIP1 mutants with endogenous TRAF2 and TNFR1 in EC were then examined by co-immunoprecipitation assays. AIP1-ΔPR, but not AIP1-F, AIP1-ΔPH, or AIP1-ΔLZ, binds to TRAF2 in the absence of TNF (Fig. 3b, -TNF). Like ASK1, TRAF2 associated with the AIP1 proteins in response to TNF (Fig. 3b, –TNF). In contrast, TNFR1 associates with AIP1-F, AIP1-ΔPH, and AIP1-ΔLZ, but not to AIP1-ΔPR (Fig. 3b). These data suggest that TNFR1 binds to a closed inactive whereas TRAF2/ASK1 bind to an open active form of AIP1. To further test this idea, we examined association of AIP1-F (the closed form) and AIP1-ΔPR (the open form) with TNFR1 and TRAF2 in response to TNF. BAEC were transfected with AIP1-F or AIP1-ΔPR in the absence or presence of TNF (10 ng/ml for 15 min). Association of AIP1 proteins with endogenous TNFR1 and TRAF2 were determined. AIP1-F (but not AIP1-ΔPR) binds to TNFR1 in resting EC, and AIP1-F/TNFR1complex was significantly reduced in the presence of TNF (Fig. 3c). In contrast, association of AIP1-F withTRAF2 is only weakly detected in resting EC but is strongly induced in response to TNF. AIP1-ΔPR constitutively binds to TRAF2 and TNF has no effects on their interaction (Fig. 3c). These data strongly suggest that TNF induces an alteration of AIP1 conformation leading to release of AIP1 from TNFR1 with concomitant binding of AIP1 to the TRAF2/ASK1 complex. AIP1 Associates with a Non-death Domain Region of TNFR1—We next determined the critical domain in TNFR1 for AIP1 binding. The intracellular domain of TNFR1 comprises of several conserved regions-a juxtamembrane (amino acids 205–307), a NSD (amino acids 308–319), which binds to an adaptor protein FAN responsible for neutral sphingomyelinase activation domain (34Adam-Klages S. Adam D. Wiegemann K. Struve S. Kolanus W. Schneider-Mergener J. Kronke M. Cell. 1996; 86: 937-947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar), and the death-domain (amino acids 346–426), which binds to SODD in resting state while recruits TRADD in response to TNF (Fig. 4a). To map the AIP1-binding domain (AID) in TNFR1, AIP1-F, and various TNFR1 truncates were transfected into BAEC. Expression of TNFR1 proteins was determined by an indirect fluorescence microscopy with anti-TNFR1 (Fig. 4b). Association of AIP1 with TNFR1 was determined by co-immunoprecipitation assay with anti-TNFR1 followed by Western blot with anti-FLAG (for AIP1-F). AIP1 associates TNFR1-WT and D212–308/346, but not with TNFR1-D205, D244, or D308–346), suggesting that the sequence between amino acids 309–346 of TNFR1 is critical for AIP1 interaction (Fig. 4c). AIP1 poorly binds to TNFR1-D320 with the intact NSD, which has been shown to be a FAN-binding motif, suggesting"

Whatever their expression pattern, they probably all contribute to the growth of colon tumors because of the presence of abundant ligands in the neuroendocrine environment of colonic tumors and/or to the production of receptor ligands by the tumor itself (11Rovere C.

In order to test this hypothesis, we developed a very simple assay by using human colon adenocarcinoma cells HT29-D4 grown in 10% FCS and screened for various peptides by their ability to inhibit cell growth. We made two dramatic hits with orexin-A and orexin-B, which appear to be robust growth inhibitors as shown here. Orexin-A and orexin-B (15Sakurai T. Amemiya A. Ishii M. Matsuzaki I. Chemelli R.M.

They are encoded by a single gene that drives the synthesis of prepro-orexin that is subsequently matured into the 33-amino acid orexin-A and the 28-amino acid orexin-B, sharing 46% amino acid identity in humans (reviewed in Ref. 17Voisin T. Rouet-Benzineb P. Reuter N. Laburthe M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Two orexin receptor subtypes OX1R and OX2R have been cloned (15Sakurai T.

Orexins were initially characterized as neuropeptides restricted to hypothalamic neurons that project in the brain to nuclei involved in the control of feeding, sleep-awakeness, neuroendocrine homeostasis, and autonomic regulation (17Voisin T. Rouet-Benzineb P. Reuter N. Laburthe M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Genetic or experimental alterations of the orexin system have been shown to be associated with narcolepsy (18Beuckmann C.T. Yanagisawa M. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 329-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 19Overeem S. Scammell T.E. Lammers G.J. Curr. Opin. Neurol. 2002; 15: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recent observations indicated that orexins and their receptors are not restricted to the hypothalamus but are also expressed in a few peripheral tissues (17Voisin T. Rouet-Benzineb P. Reuter N. Laburthe M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2003; 60: 72-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), including the gastrointestinal tract (20Kirchgessner A.L. Liu M. Neuron. 1999; 24: 941-951Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Here we show that orexins acting at the OX1R suppress the growth of human colon cancer cells HT29-D4 by promoting apoptosis through cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase activation. We further expand upon these data by showing that activation of native OX1R in other colon cancer cell lines and neuroblastoma cells or activation of recombinant OX1R expressed in CHO cells also leads to strong apoptosis and subsequent growth suppression. The OX1 receptor-mediated apoptosis therefore appears to be an intrinsic property of the receptor regardless of the cell type where the receptor is expressed.

Ther. 2000; 292: 638-646PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant CHO/hOX1R and CHO/hOX2R cell lines stably expressing human orexin receptor type 1 (OX1R) or human orexin receptor type 2 (OX2R) were grown in F-12 medium containing l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.7 mg/ml geneticin. The human colon cancer cell line HT29-D4 (22Fantini J. Abadie B. Tirard A. Remy L. Ripert J.P. el Battari A. Marvaldi J. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 83: 235-249PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. J. Marvaldi (CNRS, Marseilles, France). The human colon cancer cell lines Caco-2, SW480, LoVo, and HCT116 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). HT29-D4, SW480, and HCT116 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The Caco-2 cell line was grown in DMEM containing glucose (4.5 g/liter) supplemented with 20% FCS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin and the LoVo cell line in F-12 medium containing l-glutamine, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin.

It was grown in minimum Eagle's medium containing Earle's salts and l-glutamine supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1% sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2/air incubator. Isolation of Colonic Epithelial Cells from Normal Human Colon— Fresh normal human colons with no digestive disease were collected with the assistance of France-Transplant following French bioethical law. The colons were removed from small intestine and then immediately carried from the operating room to our laboratory in an isothermic box on ice. It usually took 30–60 min from the colon collection to the beginning of the epithelial cell isolation procedure. The colons were gently washed with water, and normal colon epithelial cell isolation was performed as reported previously (23Salomon R. Couvineau A. Rouyer-Fessard C. Voisin T. Lavallee D. Blais A. Darmoul D. Laburthe M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: E294-E300PubMed Google Scholar). Explant Culture of Human Colonic Mucosa—Fragments of human normal sigmoid colon taken at about 10 cm downstream to the tumor were obtained from a patient undergoing surgery for moderately differentiated colon carcinoma. The tissue fragments were processed according to the Guidelines of the French Ethics Committee for Research on Human Tissues. A sample, taken adjacent to the explants, was submitted to histological analysis and subsequently reported as normal by the pathologists. Immediately after removal, the tissues were placed in 4 °C oxygenated Krebs solution and processed as described previously (24Neunlist M. Toumi F. Oreschkova T. Denis M. Leborgne J. Laboisse C.L. Galmiche J.P. Jarry A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: G1028-G1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The muscularis propria was removed by microdissection under microscopic control in a Sylgard-coated Petri dish. Mucosa was then carefully stripped from the underlying compartment made of muscularis mucosae and submucosa. Fragments of 20–30 mg were cut out and pinned in Sylgard-coated Petri dishes and maintained in culture for 24 h in 2 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin and antibiotics (200 μg/ml streptomycin, 200 units/ml penicillin, 1% fungizone, Invitrogen). The explants were maintained at 37 °C in a 95% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide humid atmosphere on a rocking platform at 30 rpm, in the absence (n = 4) or presence (n = 4) of 1 μm orexin-B. Before culture (t0), some dissected fragments were frozen for subsequent analysis. At the end of the 24-h culture, the supernatants were centrifuged, and aliquots were stored at –80 °C for further analysis. Tissue specimens were cut into several fragments as follows: one was used for intracellular ATP measurement; one was used for histological examination after formalin fixation/paraffin-embedding, and one was stored at –80 °C. Tissue integrity and cell viability of the explants were assessed by standard morphological analysis, i.e. by hematoxylin-eosin staining on paraffin sections. Cell viability was also assessed by two assays as follows: measurement of the percentage of LDH released and of the intracellular ATP level. LDH was measured with the Enzyline LDH kit both in the supernatant after the 24-h incubation (extracellular LDH or LDHe) and in a small fragment of the tissue (intracellular LDH or LDHi). Percent toxicity, represented by percentage LDH released, was calculated as (LDHe/(LDHe + LDHi) × 100), taking into account the weight of the tissue samples. The LDH release was not significantly different upon a 24-h orexin-B treatment from control cultures (8.5 ± 1.2 versus 10.5 ± 1% respectively, n = 4). Cell viability was also assessed in the mucosal explants by measuring the intracellular ATP level before (t0) and after the 24-h culture. ATP was measured in tissue lysates with a luminometric assay ATPlite kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Orexin-B (1 μm) did not significantly modify the ATP level (7 ± 0.9 pmol/μg protein, n = 4) compared with the untreated explant cultures (5.5 ± 0.6 pmol/μg protein, n = 4). These levels were not significantly different from those of the explanted tissue at t0, i.e. before culture (6.2 ± 0.7 pmol/μg protein). Cell Growth Assay—CHO-K cells, CHO/hOX1R cells (both seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well), HT29-D4 cells, Caco-2, SW480, LoVo, HCT116, and SK-N-MC cells (seeded at 2 × 105 cells/well) were grown in 24-well plates for 24 h in standard culture conditions with 10% FCS (see above). The culture medium was then replaced every 24 h with fresh medium containing or not containing orexins at concentrations indicated in the legends to the figures. At the end of the treatment, adherent cells were trypsinized, and cells excluding trypan blue were counted in a hemocytometer. Cell Cycle Analysis and in Vitro [methyl-3H]Thymidine Incorporation Assay—HT29-D4 cells (3 × 105) were seeded in 25-cm2 dishes and grown at 70–80% confluency in standard medium. In some experiments, cells were maintained in serum-free media for 48 h in order to synchronize the cell cycle. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh standard medium containing or not containing 1 μm orexins. After 24 h, adherent cells were harvested by trypsinization and fixed at –20 °C by 70% ethanol in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell aliquots (106 cells) were then treated with 50 μg/ml RNase A for 15 min and stained with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide. Percentages of cells in G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases were determined by flow cytofluorometric analysis (Beckman Coulter Epics XL-MCL). For [methyl-3H]thymidine incorporation, HT29-D4 cells (105 cells/well) were seeded in 12-well clusters (Costar) in medium with 10% FCS and cultured for 24 h to allow cell adhesion. The medium was then removed; cells were washed with PBS and cultured for another 48 h with serum-free medium. Thereafter, orexin-B (1 μm) was added in standard (10% FCS) or serum-free medium, and cells were cultured for 1, 2, 4, 6, or 24 h in the presence of 0.1 μCi of [methyl-3H]thymidine per well. The medium was then removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated in trypsin/EDTA for 10 min. They were then harvested in 200 μl of medium, incubated for 30 min in 5% trichloroacetate, and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 4 min. Pellets were washed in 95% ethanol, solubilized in 10% Triton X-100, and put in 2.5 ml of scintillation fluid for counting incorporated radioactivity. For each point, cells excluding trypan blue were counted in a hemocytometer. The experiments were performed in triplicate wells and at least repeated twice. Results are expressed in disintegrations/min/106 viable cells. Characterization of Apoptosis in Cultured Cell Lines—Three methods were used for the characterization of apoptosis in cultured cell lines. For the TUNEL method, cells (7 × 105) were seeded on Lab-Tek chamber coverglasses and grown for 24 h in standard culture medium. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins. After 24 h, cells were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS at 4 °C followed by permeabilization for 10 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then analyzed by the TUNEL method using the Roche Diagnostics in situ cell death detection kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. The samples were vizualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Zeiss). For in situ chromosome analysis, cells (2 × 105) were seeded on glass coverslips and grown for 24 h in standard medium. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins. After 24 h, cells were fixed with 80% ethanol for 10 min at 4 °C and stained with either propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) or DAPI (10 μg/ml). Apoptotic nuclei were detected by epifluorescence microscopy. For DNA fragmentation assay, cells (2 × 106) were seeded in culture dishes and grown for 24 h in standard culture medium. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins. After 48 h, cells were trypsinized and collected by centrifugation for 5 min at 1,000 × g. DNA was then extracted as described (25Murgia M. Pizzo P. Sandona D. Zanovello P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10939-10941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed in 1 ml of cold PBS and then lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 4% SDS, and 0.38 mg/ml of proteinase K. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 65 °C, followed by an overnight incubation at 37 °C. DNA was then precipitated, washed, resuspended in Tris-EDTA buffer, and incubated for 1 h with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A as described (25Murgia M. Pizzo P. Sandona D. Zanovello P. Rizzuto R. Di Virgilio F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10939-10941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA fragmentation was analyzed on 1.5% agarose gels in the presence of 0.5 mg/ml ethidium bromide. Cytochrome c Release—HT29-D4 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture dishes (106/dish) and grown in standard culture medium for 24 h. The medium was then replaced by a fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins, and cells were further grown for 24 h. After cell lysis, cytochrome c was measured in cytosol (14,000 × g supernatant after 15 min centrifugation) by using an ELISA kit (see above) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Under these experimental conditions, the cytosolic fraction did not contain mitochondria as verified by electronic microscopy. 2G. Peranzi and M. Ostuni, unpublished results. Alternatively, cytochrome c was characterized by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot. Briefly, cytochrome c in cytosol was immunoprecipitated using the 6H2-B4 monoclonal anticytochrome c antibodies (2 μg/ml) and protein G-Sepharose beads. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the washed beads, the samples were separated by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Total cytochrome c present in the cellular extract before cytosolic separation was characterized as described above. The blot was probed with 1 μg/ml of 7H8–2C12 monoclonal anti-cytochrome c antibodies, and immune complexes were revealed with secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies using a chemiluminescent kit. In Situ Caspase Activation—HT29-D4 cells (7 × 105) were seeded on Lab-Tek chamber coverglasses and grown for 24 h in standard culture medium. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing 1 μm orexins. After 24 h, caspase activation was detected as described (26Zeuner A. Eramo A. Peschle C. De Maria R. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) using the CaspACE™ FITC-VAD-FMK In Situ Marker (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) which binds to activated caspases. The bound marker was then localized by fluorescence detection using a confocal microscope. Immunocytochemical Studies of Cleaved Forms of Caspase-3 and Caspase-7—HT29-D4 cells (7 × 105) were seeded on Lab-Tek chamber cover glasses and grown for 24 h in standard culture medium. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins. After 24 h, the coverslips were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies (Asp-175, dilution 1:100) or anti-cleaved caspase-7 antibodies (Asp-198, dilution 1:100) that specifically recognize cleaved enzyme isoforms. These antibodies do not recognize full-length caspase-3 or full-length caspase-7 or other cleaved caspases. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin IgG was used as the secondary antibody. Vectashield mounting medium containing propidium iodide was added, and coverslips were observed by confocal microscopy. Western Immunoblotting Studies of Caspase-3 and Caspase-7— HT29-D4 cells were seeded in 75-cm2 culture dishes (106/dish) and grown in standard culture medium for 24 h. The culture medium was then replaced with fresh culture medium containing or not containing orexins. After 24 h, cells were lysed by adding Chaps cell extract buffer containing 50 mm Pipes/NaOH (pH 6.5), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 5 mm DTT, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were resuspended in the buffer and frozen and thawed three times, and the lysate was centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 rpm. After addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer to the supernatant (30 μg of protein), the samples were separated by electrophoresis on 16% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-cleaved caspase-3 antibodies (Asp-175, dilution 1:1000) or anti-cleaved caspase-7 antibodies (Asp-198, dilution 1:1000) that specifically recognize cleaved enzyme isoforms. Subsequently, blots were probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-3 antibodies (1:1000), which principally detect the full-length procaspase-3 (32 kDa) and the fragment of cleaved caspase-3 following cleavage at Asp-175 (17 kDa), or with rabbit polyclonal anti-caspase-7 antibodies (1:1000), which detect the full-length procaspase-7 (35 kDa). Blots were standardized by using the mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibodies (AC-74). Immune complexes were revealed with secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies by using a chemiluminescent kit. Morphological Analysis of Apoptotic Cell Death in Human Colonic Mucosa Explants—Morphological analysis of apoptotic cell death was assessed on paraffin sections by using two assays. The DNA-specific dye Hoechst 33258 (Calbiochem), which visualizes all the steps of the apoptotic process, was applied on deparaffinized sections (1 μg/ml in Hanks' balanced salt solution without phenol red, Invitrogen). Sections were mounted with the Prolong Antifade medium (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The fluorescence was observed on an Axiovert 200-M-Carl Zeiss microscope equipped with an ApoTome slider. Cells were visualized with a ×63/1.4 oil immersion lens. Image processing was performed using an AxioCam MRCCD camera and the AxioVision 4.0 software (Carl Zeiss). In addition, immunohistochemical staining of apoptotic epithelial cells was performed by using the M30 antibody (1:50) as described previously (27Charrier L. Jarry A. Toquet C. Bou-Hanna C. Chedorge M. Denis M. Vallette G. Laboisse C.L. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 2169-2174PubMed Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes a cytokeratin 18 neoepitope cleaved by caspases and is considered as an early marker of apoptosis in epithelial cells (28Leers M.P. Kolgen W. Bjorklund V. B"
https://openalex.org/W1992964109,"Induction of epithelial cell motility is a fundamental morphogenetic event that is recapitulated during carcinoma metastasis. Random motility of NBT-II carcinoma cells on collagen critically depends on paxillin phosphorylation at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118, the binding sites for the adapter protein CrkII. Two constitutive partners of CrkII are the exchange factors DOCK180 and C3G. CrkII bound to DOCK180 formed a signaling complex with phosphorylated paxillin that was necessary for cell migration as inferred from the inhibition caused by a DOCK180-interfering mutant. DOCK180, which acts predominantly on the Rho family GTPase Rac1, restored cell locomotion in cells expressing Phe-31/118 paxillin mutants deficient in Rac1 GTP-loading, suggesting that formation of paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 signaling complex controls collagen-dependent migration mainly through Rac1 activation. In migrating cells, CrkII constitutive association with C3G was not sufficient to stimulate its GDP/GTP exchange activity toward the Ras family GTPase Rap1. However, when constitutively active RapV12 was overexpressed, it negatively regulated cell motility. Activation of the C3G/Rap1 signaling pathway resulted in down-regulation of the paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 complex and reduction of Rac1-GTP, suggesting that Rap1 activation could suppress the Rac1 signaling pathway in epithelial cells.

One efficient way to regulate complex cellular behaviors such as cell migration is to assemble functional networks composed of multidomain proteins (1Pawson T. Nash P. Science. 2003; 300: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The focal adhesion protein paxillin is a good example of a multidomain regulator. Paxillin primary structure is composed of several protein-binding modules (proline-rich region, LD motifs, phosphorylatable tyrosine, LIM domains) that allow its association with structural and signaling molecules (2Turner C.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E231-E236Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Perturbing the formation of protein complexes has revealed the functional significance of some of these domains. This has led to the notion that paxillin is a convergence point of signaling pathways that positively modulate cell migration. For example, paxillin LD4 motif interacts with a multiprotein complex composed of p95PKL, or paxillin kinase linker, in association with the p21 GTPase-activated kinase PAK 1The abbreviations used are: PAK, 21 GTPase-activated kinase; SH, Src homology; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PL, poly-l-lysine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GFP, green fluorescent protein; RBD, Ral binding domain; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interacting binding; C3G, Crk SH3-binding guanine nucleotide-releasing protein. and the PAK-interactive exchange factor PIX, which is required for directional cell migration (3Turner C.E.

Furthermore, direct paxillin association with the α4 cytoplasmic tail of integrins correlates with random cell migration (5Liu S. Thomas S.M. Woodside D.G. Rose D.M. Kiosses W.B. Pfaff M.

CrkII belongs to a family of adapters that is composed of one Src homology 2 (SH2) and two SH3 domains capable of forming selective multi-protein complexes with numerous cellular proteins (8Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6348-6371Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin binds to Crk SH2 domain. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) DOCK180 is among the proteins that has been previously identified to associate with the N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk (9Matsuda M. Ota S. Tanimura R. Nakamura H. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Nagashima K. Kurata T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14468-14472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). DOCK180 is an unconventional GEF that functions as an activator of the Rho GTPase Rac1 when associated with the protein ELMO1 (10Braga V.M.

Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). It belongs to an evolutionarily conserved protein family that has been implicated in fundamental migratory processes including gonadal dorsal tip cell migration and axonal pathfinding in Caenorhabditis elegans (12Wu Y.C. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), dorsal closure, and border cell migration in Drosophila melanogaster embryos (13Erickson M.R. Galletta B.J.

Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1770-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Another binding partner of CrkII is the exchange factor C3G, which has also been implicated in modulating cell migrations (16Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Uemura N. Griffin J.D. J. Biol.

Development. 2003; 130: 355-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). C3G is an activator of Rap1, a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases that was originally identified as an antagonist of oncogenic Ras (19Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 20Caron E. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The physiological role of C3G was recently addressed using fibroblasts obtained from C3G gene knockout mice; they showed accelerated migration that was suppressed only when GEFs for Rap1 or the GTPase itself were overexpressed, suggesting that Rap1 could act as a negative regulator of cell migration (16Ohba Y. Ikuta K. Ogura A. Matsuda J. Mochizuki N. Nagashima K. Kurokawa K. Mayer B.J. Maki K. Miyazaki J. Matsuda M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3333-3341Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that upon collagen stimulation of NBT-II cells, the adapter protein paxillin becomes tyrosine phosphorylated. By generating interfering mutations, we showed that paxillin residues Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 are the main sites of phosphorylation by collagen (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation on both tyrosines is the precondition for the formation of a paxillin-Crk complex that is essential for random cell migration on collagen. A double mutation in these two critical tyrosine residues (Phe-31/118) or a complementary mutation on the SH2 binding site of CrkII (R38V) has a similar inhibitory effect on cell migration. We also showed that a point mutation on the SH3 domain of CrkII (W169L) reduced cell migration on collagen, implying that it served to link the paxillin/Crk complex with downstream molecules. In this work, we sought to identify downstream effectors of the paxillin-Crk complex to determine their role in the collagen-induced random migration of NBT-II cells. We have found that DOCK180 together with paxillin-Crk constitutes the main pathway transducing collagen-mediated signals for the activation of Rac1 during NBT-II cell migration. This signaling pathway is down-regulated when cell migration is counteracted by C3G/Rap1 activation, suggesting a balance between Rac1 and Rap1 GTPases in controlling the migratory versus the stationary state of the cell. Reagents and Antibodies—Rat collagen type I and poly-l-lysine (PL) were from Sigma. Antibodies against paxillin, CrkII, Rap1, Rac1, (BD Transduction Laboratories), C3G, DOCK180 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), phosphospecific Tyr-118-paxillin (BioSource International), glutathione S-transferase (GST; Amersham Biosciences), and GFP (Roche Applied Science) were used. Plasmids encoding full-length human DOCK180 and DOCK180-delPS were provided by M. Matsuda (Osaka University, Osaka, Japan), myc-tagged GTPases RacV12, RacN17 vectors by A. Hall (University College, London, UK), GFP-tagged RacV12 and RacN17 by F. Sanchez-Madrid (Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain), CrkII plasmid by R. Klemke (The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA), and Rap1 plasmids by T. Kinashi (Kyoto University, Japan). GFP-tagged wild type and Phe-31/118 paxillin were described previously (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The GST-fused SH3 domain of c-Crk was a gift of R. B. Birge (Rockefeller University, NY). The GST-Ral binding domain (RBD) of RalGDS was provided by F. Porteau (Institut Cochin, Paris, France). Cell Culture and Transfections—Culture of NBT-II rat bladder carcinoma cells and the generation of the stable cell line Phe-31/118 cell line (clone Fx1) were described previously (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For migration assays, transient transfections were done using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's recommendations as reported previously (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation experiments and pull-down assays, polyethylenimine was used as transfection vehicle as described previously (21Edme N. Downward J. Thiery J.P. Boyer B. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 2591-2601PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations, Pull-down Assays and Western Blots—Cells growing in complete medium were trypsinized, resuspended in complete medium, and replated on dishes precoated with PL (200 μg/ml) or collagen (10 μg/ml). Cells were lysed in Triton buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μm sodium orthovanadate). Cell lysates were processed for immunoprecipitation, or SH3-Crk pull-down, followed by immunoblotting as described before (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Immunocomplexes were quantified using the Scion Image program (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). GTPases Activity Assays—The levels of active GTP-bound GTPases were determined as follows. For each pull-down assay, 30 μg of the GST-CRIB of PAK or GST-RBD of RalGDS were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 30 min before assay. Cells were substrate stimulated or left in suspension for the indicated times, then lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were incubated with the GST proteins coupled to beads for 60 min at 4 °C. Beads were washed with Nonidet P-40 buffer, and proteins were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. The presence of active GTPases was visualized by Western blots using appropriate antibodies. Cell Migration Assay—Random cell migration was assayed as described previously (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Images were analyzed with the Metamorph software (Universal Imaging Corp.). The motility of individual cells was evaluated by tracking their movement over 12 h. The average speed of locomotion (micrometers per hour) was calculated as the total track length divided by the number of hours recorded. For each experimental condition, 90–100 cells were analyzed from at least three independent experiments. The Student's t test was used to evaluate the data. CrkII-DOCK180 Signaling Complex Binds to Paxillin in NBT-II Cells—To identify signaling partners downstream of the paxillin-Crk complex, we carried out GST pull-down assays using the N-terminal SH3 domain of Crk on protein extracts obtained from cells stimulated with collagen or PL, a control for integrin-independent cell adhesion. Both C3G and DOCK180 proteins were immunodetected in NBT-II cells and in vitro bound to the SH3 domain of Crk when stimulated with either PL or collagen, suggesting that their association with Crk was not modulated by external stimuli (Fig. 1A). Thus, at least two CrkII signaling complexes exist simultaneously in NBT-II cells in association with different GEFs: Crk-C3G and Crk-DOCK180. We then examined the interaction between CrkII and DOCK180 in collagen-stimulated cells in vivo. Binding of CrkII to DOCK180 was detected in co-immunoprecipitates of DOCK180 isolated from both PL and collagen-stimulated cells, confirming the presence of a constitutive Crk-DOCK180 complex in NBT-II cells. Similar results were obtained in reverse immunoprecipitation experiments using the Crk antibody (data not shown). The presence of paxillin within the Crk-DOCK180 complex was detected when cells were plated on collagen (Fig. 1B), suggesting that the formation of the trimeric complex was regulated by paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation. Examination of total lysates with phosphospecific antibodies confirmed the increase in phosphorylated Tyr-31 (data not shown) and Tyr-118 paxillin (Fig. 1B) in response to collagen stimulation compared with PL. Additional experiments using lysates from cells transiently transfected with the GFP-tagged paxillin mutant Phe-31/118, which cannot form a complex with CrkII (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), revealed no DOCK180 in the immunoprecipitates (supplemental Fig. S1). These results are consistent with our previous findings demonstrating that the formation of a paxillin-Crk complex is dependent on collagen-induced paxillin phosphorylation on Tyr-31 and Tyr-118. DOCK180 Is Downstream of Paxillin-Crk Complex in NBT-II Cells—The SH3 domain of CrkII, which serves as DOCK180 binding site, clearly has an important function because a point mutation impairs migration of NBT-II cells on collagen (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). To determine whether DOCK180 was also a necessary component of the collagen-mediated random migration, we overexpressed the full-length molecule and the DOCK180 mutant deleted at amino acid 1472 (DOCK180-dlPS), which lacks Crk SH3 binding site (22Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kurata T. Sugimura H. Matsuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24479-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and contains a truncated “Docker” domain (11Brugnera E. Haney L. Grimsley C. Lu M. Walk S.F. Tosello-Trampont A.C. Macara I.G. Madhani H. Fink G.R. Ravichandran K.S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 574-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). DOCK180-dlPS can form a complex with ELMO1 but can neither bind to nor activate Rac1. Thus, its dominant-negative effect is by direct competition with endogenous DOCK180 for associated partners such as ELMO. These constructs were introduced separately into NBT-II cells together with an enhanced GFP reporter plasmid. Forty-eight hours later, cells were trypsinized and added sparsely onto collagen-coated plates, and the fluorescently labeled cells were followed by time-lapse video microscopy. Overexpression of DOCK180-dlPS significantly reduced the velocity of individual cell migration to the same extent as the complementary CrkII W169L mutation (speed of locomotion of 15.3 ± 7.3 μm/h), whereas the wild-type form of DOCK180 had an enhancing effect (Fig. 1C). To confirm that DOCK180 was part of the paxillin-Crk signaling pathway required for cell migration, we overexpressed DOCK180 in the motility deficient NBT-II clone Fx1 stably expressing paxillin mutated on Tyr-31 and Tyr-118. Fx1 cells are unable to move on collagen because the point mutations on paxillin prevent its association with CrkII, as previously demonstrated (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Transfection of wild-type DOCK180 but not DOCK180-dlPS (speed of locomotion of 10.6 ± 3.2 μm/h) into these cells restored the migration deficiency, as does overexpression of CrkII (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), thus placing DOCK180 downstream of paxillin (Fig. 1C). The positive effect of DOCK180 on migration required collagen stimulation because transfection with the wild-type construct had no effect when cells were plated on uncoated plastic (speed of locomotion of 5.3 ± 2.9 μm/h). All together, these results support the notion that paxillin association with CrkII and DOCK180 is an essential component of the random migratory behavior of NBT-II cells on collagen. Rac Activation Is Downstream of the Paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 Signaling Complex—It has been reported previously that DOCK180 is a direct activator of the small GTPase Rac1 (23Côté J.F. Vuori K. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4901-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 24Kiyokawa E. Hashimoto Y. Kobayashi S. Sugimura H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3331-3336Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), which is indispensable for cell migration. We therefore measured Rac1 activity of NBT-II cells under conditions of random migration on collagen. The activation state of Rac was measured in pull-down assays with a GST fusion of the CRIB domain of PAK, bearing the binding region for the GTP-bound state (25Sander E.E. ten Klooster J.P. van Delft S. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1009-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Increased levels (up to 4.5-fold) of Rac-GTP loading were observed in lysates prepared from NBT-II cells plated on collagen relative to PL (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that Rac1 is activated in NBT-II cells induced to migrate. To determine whether Rac1 activation was contingent on the association of paxillin with CrkII and DOCK180, we carried out pull-down assays on cells overexpressing either wild-type paxillin-GFP or the mutant Phe-31/118-GFP, which cannot form a complex with CrkII and DOCK180. Kinetics studies on paxillin-GFP expressing cells demonstrated sustained activation of Rac1 after stimulation with collagen. In contrast, Rac1 activity in Phe-31/118-GFP expressing cells resulted in a 20–40% decrease in time upon collagen stimulation (Fig. 2B). Likewise, pull-down assays carried out with the Fx1 stable clone failed to reveal an increase in GTP-loaded Rac1 (Fig. 2C). Because overexpression of wild-type DOCK180 rescued the inability of Fx1 cells to move on collagen (Fig. 1C), we tested whether it could promote Rac1 GTP-loading. As shown in Fig. 2C, expression of DOCK180 in Fx1 cells led to a 2-fold increase in Rac1 activation over Fx1 control. These results demonstrate that the paxillin Phe-31/118 mutant can block the signaling pathway leading to Rac1 activation, which can be bypassed by overexpression of downstream molecules. However, Crk overexpression in Fx1 cells had a modest effect on Rac activation (1.2-fold) and a non-enhancing effect on parental cells when stimulated with collagen (supplemental Fig. S2). That Rac1 activity is required for random migration of NBT-II cells on collagen was confirmed by transfecting cells with the dominant inhibitory mutant of Rac1 (RacN17). RacN17 expression altered the formation of lamellipodia with a 95% inhibition of cell migration induced by collagen (Fig. 2D; data not shown). The inhibitory effect of RacN17 on cell migration was partially reversed by DOCK180 (Fig. 2D), suggesting that the exchange factor sequestered the Rac-interfering mutant. Overexpression of the dominant-active mutant form of Rac1 (RacV12) enhanced cell migration on collagen by 1.5-fold over control (Fig. 2D). Expression of this constitutive active form in Fx1 cells expressing the Phe-31/118 paxillin mutant restored cell migration (Fig. 2D). These results provide an additional element to directly implicate the paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 signaling pathway in regulating Rac1 activity required during random cell migration on collagen. Activated Rap1 Inhibits Collagen-mediated Migration of NBT-II Cells—C3G is a GEF for the small GTPase Rap1 (26Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H. Kurata T. Matsuda M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6746-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar), which associates with the SH3 domain of CrkII in NBT-II cells (Fig. 1A). It has been reported previously that Rap1 can be activated by integrin mediated cell attachment (27Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore examined its activation state in NBT-II cells upon adhesion to collagen, the cell motility inducing substrate. The presence of the GTP-bound form was assessed in pull-down assays using the GST-linked RBD of RalGDS (28Franke B. Akkerman J.W. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 252-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). GTP loading of Rap1 was detected after 30 min of plating when 90% of cells were still round and returned to basal levels as cells spread on the substrate. In contrast, Rap1 activity was readily detectable in lysates prepared from cells maintained in suspension increasing with time as cellular aggregates formed (Fig. 3A; data not shown). Thus, in epithelial cells Rap1 activation is transient after cell-substrate adhesion and sustained when cell-cell contacts are favored, suggesting that Rap1 effect on cell adhesion could also be integrin-independent. To address the functional significance of the decrease in Rap1 activation on collagen, we tested the consequence of expressing two mutant forms of Rap1 on random cell migration. Overexpression of the constitutively active Rap1V12 form suppressed cell migration (9.8 ±.4 μm/h), whereas the interfering mutant Rap1N17 rather enhanced cell velocity (50.8 ±.5 μm/h) (Fig. 3B). Moreover, overexpression of Rap1 exchange factor C3G or the membrane targeted C3G-F suppressed cell migration induced by collagen (Fig. 3B). Both C3G and C3G-F are able to induce GTP-loading of Rap1 of NBT-II cells by 3- and 5.5-fold, respectively, on collagen when overexpressed (Fig. 4A). Therefore, when Rap1 is activated, the random migration of NBT-II cells on collagen is suppressed. Next, we tested the hypothesis that the inability of cells to move on collagen when Rap1 is activated results from an altered association of paxillin with CrkII. To this end, we stimulated Rap1 activation by overexpressing C3G or C3G-F and then examined the presence of the paxillin-Crk complex after collagen stimulation. Cells lysates of transiently transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with Crk antibodies and the precipitates were analyzed by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). In cells expressing either C3G or C3G-F, binding of paxillin to CrkII was diminished by an average of 30–40%, respectively, compared with control cells transfected with an empty vector. As expected, membrane-targeted C3G-F was more efficient than C3G in activating Rap1, blocking the association between CrkII and paxillin and inhibiting cell migration (Figs. 3B and 4, A and B), as estimated from the levels of overexpressed C3G protein. A similar 30% reduction in Crk-paxillin association was observed in cells transfected with the constitutive active Rap1V12 (Fig. 4C). It is noteworthy that the reduction of paxillin within the Crk immunocomplex in cells transfected with Rap1V12 was accompanied by a 60–75% decrease in Crk-DOCK180 and a concomitant 1.4-fold increase in Crk-C3G complexes compared with control. Because expression of constitutively active Rap1 inhibited collagen-mediated migration, we examined its influence on the GTP-loading of Rac1 in pull-down assays. We found that the collagen-mediated Rac1 activation was significantly suppressed, up to 50%, when Rap1V12 was overexpressed (Fig. 4D). These data indicated that activation of Rap1 in NBT-II cells could down-regulate the paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 molecular complex, suggesting that Rap1 could be involved in a signaling pathway that leads to Rac1 inhibition. Cell migration is a complex multistep process that is under the control of many signal transduction pathways. Members of the Ras and Rho family of GTPases exhibit distinct roles in coordinating cellular responses required for cell migration (29Bar-Sagi D. Hall A. Cell. 2000; 103: 227-238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe a molecular complex composed of paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 that governs one major aspect of cell migration, which is the activation of Rac1. We also report that Rac1 and the Ras-like GTPase Rap1 can have opposing roles in regulating cell migration. Rac1 controls actin cytoskeletal dynamics and integrin adhesions that are essential for lamellipodium extension during cell migration (30Etienne-Manneville S. Hall A. Nature. 2002; 420: 629-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3875) Google Scholar, 31Ridley A.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2713-2722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rac1 activation is initiated by upstream signals acting upon Rac-specific GEFs that catalyze the exchange of GDP for GTP. GTP-bound Rac can then relay information to a large number of downstream effectors (32Zheng Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 724-732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Therefore, Rac1 is activated in NBT-II migrating cells in response to integrin-derived signals. In contrast, cells expressing the paxillin mutant Phe-31/118 are deficient in cell migration and are unable to induce Rac1 activation above basal levels. During NBT-II cell migration, phosphorylation of paxillin on Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 recruits pre-existing Crk-DOCK180 molecular complexes (Ref. 7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar and current study). DOCK180 has been shown to regulate cell migration events by forming a signaling complex with CrkII and the SH2-binding protein p130CAS (33Cheresh D.A. Leng J. Klemke R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 1107-1116Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 34Gu J. Sumida Y. Sanzen N. Sekiguchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27090-27097Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). In NBT-II cells, however, p130CAS does not play a major role in collagen-mediated migrations, possibly reflecting cell type selectivity as discussed previously (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Instead, we found that DOCK180 is an effector of paxillin signaling that is required for cell migration; it also binds to ELMO1 when the latter is overexpressed (data not shown). We could confirm that DOCK180 is downstream of phosphorylated paxillin because its overexpression rescued both the Rac1-GTP loading defect as well as the migratory impairment of cells expressing the Phe-31/118 paxillin mutant. Although Crk alone had a modest effect on Rac1 activation in Fx1 and parental cells, its overexpression promoted cell migration (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of Crk had no effect on the GTP loading of Rac1 in fibronectin adherent COS-7 cells but enhanced their haptotactic migration (35Abassi Y.A. Vuori K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4571-4582Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, paxillin association with CrkII and DOCK180 couples integrin signaling to Rac1 activation during cell migration. The translocation of paxillin to cell-substratum contact sites after collagen stimulation (7Petit V. Boyer B. Lentz D. Turner C.E. Thiery J.P. Vallés A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 957-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) and its adapter function may serve to recruit and stabilize signaling molecules such as CrkII and DOCK180 to these sites as previously shown for the p95PKL-PIX-PKL complex (36Brown M.C. West K.A. Turner C.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1550-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). These membrane-targeted complexes would then facilitate localized activation of Rac1 at the leading edge where the highest levels of Rac-GTP are preferentially found in moving cells (37del Pozo M.A. Alderson N.B. Kiosses W.B. Chiang H.H. Anderson R.G. Schwartz M.A. Science. 2004; 303: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, 38Kraynov V.S. Chamberlain C. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Slabaugh S. Hahn K.M. Science. 2000; 290: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). In agreement, we have observed that a GFP-tagged GS-DOCK180 construct containing the CrkII binding site (39Kobayashi S. Shirai T. Kiyokawa E. Mochizuki N. Matsuda M. Fukui Y. Biochem.

Paxillin is a multidomain protein with scaffolding function that is linked to cell migration events by activating different signal transduction pathways. Disruption of the interaction between paxillin and p95PKL by overexpression of a paxilllin LD4 domain deletion in CHO.K1 cells severely compromised directed cell migration in an in vitro wound-healing assay but did not prevent random cell migration on fibronectin (3Turner C.E. Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Riedy M.C. Nikolopoulos S.N. McDonald A.R. Bagrodia S. Thomas S. Leventhal P.S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 851-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). In response to motility signals, paxillin may associate directly with FAK, Pyk2, and Src kinases, which are key regulators of adhesion turnover in migrating cells (40Ridley A.J. Schwartz M.A. Burridge K. Firtel R.A. Ginsberg M.H. Borisy G. Parsons J.T. Horwitz A.R. Science. 2003; 302: 1704-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (3870) Google Scholar). In NMuMG cells in which Rac1 activity is mainly controlled by the p130CAS-Crk-DOCK180 signaling complex, phosphorylated Tyr-31/118 paxillin positively regulates cell migration by binding to the SH2 domain of p120RasGAP and thereby suppresses RhoA activity (41Tsubouchi A. Sakakura J. Yagi R. Mazaki Y. Schaefer E. Yano H. Sabe H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Because cells are capable of displaying diverse motile behaviors (e.g. directional versus random movement; individual versus the movement of groups of cells), the multiple signaling pathways emerging from paxillin to regulate cell migration could be engaged simultaneously or not, depending on cellular context and/or environmental conditions. Another binding partner of CrkII in NBT-II cells is the Rap1 exchange factor C3G. Although pre-formed Crk-C3G complexes exist in NBT-II cells, Rap1 activation was not sustained after adhesion to collagen in standard pull-down assays. Paxillin-Crk-C3G complexes were never detected in paxillin immunoprecipitates (data not shown), implying that, unlike Crk-DOCK180, this signaling complex might be inaccessible to collagen-derived motility signals in migrating cells. Instead, Rap1 activity remained elevated when cell-cell contacts were favored. In addition we found that overexpression of constitutively active Rap1 or its exchange factor C3G suppressed cell migration on collagen. The inhibition of cell migration by C3G/Rap1 activation was concomitant with the disassembly of the paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 molecular complex and the reduction of Rac1 GTP-loading, suggesting that Rap1 could negatively regulate Rac1 signaling and, consequently, cell migration. In this respect, we were able to switch the complex balance from Crk-DOCK180 to Crk-C3G by stimulating the C3G/Rap1 signaling pathway. One mechanism by which Rap1 could exert a negative effect on cell motility is by acting upon molecular components that modulate the assembly of the paxillin-Crk-DOCK180 signaling complex. For example, the inhibition and/or activation of specific tyrosine kinases and phosphatases could cause paxillin dephosphorylation and, consequently, a diminution of the complex. Thus, the down-regulation of the Rac1 pathway by an increase in Rap1signaling would bring about the conversion of fibroblast-like moving of cells toward an epithelial state. There is evidence that Rap1 proteins could participate in the formation and maintenance of adherens junctions in epithelia, as the Rho GTPases (42Braga V.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 546-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 43Van Aelst L. Symons M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 1032-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). For example, in the developing D. melanogaster embryo, the positioning of adherens junctions in epithelial wing cells requires active Rap1 (44Knox A.L. Brown N.H. Science. 2002; 295: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Downstream of activated Rap1 is Canoe, the D. melanogaster ortholog of the multidomain junctional protein AF-6/afadin in vertebrates, which is required during embryonic dorsal closure, a process that relies on the movement of cohesive epithelial sheets (45Boettner B. Harjes P. Ishimaru S. Heke M. Fan H.Q. Qin Y. Van Aelst L. Gaul U. Genetics. 2003; 165: 159-169PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been shown recently that Rap1-GFP can localize to the plasma membrane of mammalian epithelial cells, in addition to its intracellular distribution (46Bivona T.G. Wiener H.H. Ahearn I.M. Silletti J. Chiu V.K. Philips M.R. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Thus, in mammalian cells, Rap1 may be involved in epithelialization events like those occurring during the movement of an epithelial sheet in wound healing or the conversions of mesenchymal to epithelial cells. Therefore, our current efforts are concentrated on the identification of Rap1-dependent signals that oppose the Rac1 pathway during the reconversion process of NBT-II cells back to the epithelial phenotype that is observed when external stimuli become absent or insufficient.

https://openalex.org/W2027037661,"For many pathogenic bacteria like Pseudomonas aeruginosa heme is an essential source of iron. After uptake, the heme molecule is degraded by heme oxygenases to yield iron, carbon monoxide, and biliverdin. The heme oxygenase PigA is only induced under iron-limiting conditions and produces the unusual biliverdin isomers IXβ and IXδ. The gene for a second putative heme oxygenase in P. aeruginosa, bphO, occurs in an operon with the gene bphP encoding a bacterial phytochrome. Here we provide biochemical evidence that bphO encodes for a second heme oxygenase in P. aeruginosa. HPLC, 1H, and 13C NMR studies indicate that BphO is a “classic” heme oxygenase in that it produces biliverdin IXα. The data also suggest that the overall fold of BphO is likely to be the same as that reported for other α-hydroxylating heme oxygenases. Recombinant BphO was shown to prefer ferredoxins or ascorbate as a source of reducing equivalents in vitro and the rate-limiting step for the oxidation of heme to biliverdin is the release of product. In eukaryotes, the release of biliverdin is driven by biliverdin reductase, the subsequent enzyme in heme catabolism. Because P. aeruginosa lacks a biliverdin reductase homologue, data are presented indicating an involvement of the bacterial phytochrome BphP in biliverdin release from BphO and possibly from PigA.

In the presence of a suitable electron donor the enzyme heme oxygenase (HO, 1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; BR, bilirubin; BV, biliverdin; BVR, biliverdin reductase; Fd(s), ferredoxin(s); Fur, ferric uptake regulator; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; (h)CPR, (human) cytochrome P450 reductase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy.1The abbreviations used are: HO, heme oxygenase; BR, bilirubin; BV, biliverdin; BVR, biliverdin reductase; Fd(s), ferredoxin(s); Fur, ferric uptake regulator; GPC, gel permeation chromatography; GST, glutathione S-transferase; (h)CPR, (human) cytochrome P450 reductase; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; ALA, δ-aminolevulinic acid; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence; TES, 2-{[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]amino}ethanesulfonic acid; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy. EC 1.14.99.3) catalyzes the oxidative degradation of heme to yield equimolar amounts of biliverdin (BV), iron, and CO (see Fig. 1). In the well studied eukaryotic HOs, NADPH and NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase serve as the electron donor (1Maines D.M. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2557-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1570) Google Scholar, 2Wilks A. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Bacterial HOs have only recently been described, and the HO from Corynebacterium diphtheriae (HmuO) was among the first ones to be discovered (3Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In C. diphtheriae the HO reaction is utilized to release iron from heme under pathogenic (i.e. free-iron limiting) conditions (3Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In fact, the breakdown of heme to mine iron is thought to be the major function of HOs from pathogenic organisms, thus allowing them to overcome the low concentrations of free-iron necessary for successful colonization (infection). Their function in iron utilization has been shown for HOs from several pathogenic bacteria, including Neisseria meningitidis (HemO), Corynebacterium ulcerans (HmuO), and Staphylococcus aureus (IsdG/I) (4Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 436-443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar, 5Zhu W. Hunt D.J. Richardson A.R. Stojiljkovic I. J.

One of the most interesting bacterial HOs was recently identified in the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The pigA gene, originally identified in a screen for iron-regulated genes, was shown to encode a protein with homology to the neisserial HOs (7Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The gene, which is part of a five-gene operon (pigA–E), is under the control of the global iron regulator Fur (ferric uptake regulator) and is only expressed under iron-limiting conditions (8Vasil M.L. Ochsner U.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 399-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Unlike all other eu- and prokaryotic HOs that regiospecifically cleave the α-meso carbon of heme, PigA targets the β- and δ-meso carbons of the heme macrocycle (7Ratliff M. Zhu W. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Stojiljkovic I. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 6394-6403Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The unusual production of β- and δ-BV was shown to be due to an unusual seating of the substrate heme in the active site pocket of PigA (9Caignan G.A. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Zeng Y. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Bunce R.A. Eastman M.A. Rivera M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14879-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The purpose for the production of these BV isomers and their fate in P. aeruginosa, however, is currently unknown. In addition to their function in iron utilization bacterial HOs are also involved in the first step of phycobilin biosynthesis. These linear tetrapyrrole molecules are precursors of the chromophores for the cyanobacterial light-harvesting phycobiliproteins and the photoreceptor phytochrome. Phytochromes are traditionally known as biliprotein photoreceptors in plants but have recently also been discovered in bacteria (10Davis S.J. Vener A.V. Vierstra R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 2517-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Unlike plant and cyanobacterial phytochromes, which carry a phytochromobilin or phycocyanobilin chromophore, bacteriophytochromes (BphPs) from non-photosynthetic prokaryotes have been shown to utilize a BV chromophore (11Bhoo S.-H. Davis S.J. Walker J. Karniol B. Viestra R.D. Nature. 2001; 414: 776-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). P. aeruginosa was among the first non-photosynthetic bacteria identified to harbor a gene encoding for a BphP. This bacteriophytochrome is a typical sensor kinase of a prokaryotic two-component signaling system. The bphP gene is located in an operon downstream from a bphO gene, which encodes a putative HO. So far, no gene encoding for the corresponding response regulator has been identified in P. aeruginosa. Herein we present the first biochemical and biophysical evidence that bphO encodes for a functional HO that oxidizes heme to BV IXα. Because P. aeruginosa is the first known organism to encode two functional HOs, each capable of oxidizing heme to a different BV isomer, their involvement in phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis has been investigated and will also be discussed. All chemicals, including glutathione-agarose, were purchased from Sigma (Munich, Germany) and were American Chemical Society grade or better. Restriction enzymes were from Invitrogen (Cleveland, OH). MasterTaq™ was purchased from Eppendorf Scientific (Westbury, NY). HPLC-grade acetone and 80% formic acid were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). The expression vector pGEX-6P-1 and PreScission™ protease were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Centricon-10 concentrator devices were purchased from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Cytochrome P450 reductase was from Merck Biosciences (Bad Soden, Germany), all ferredoxins, ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase, and catalase were from Sigma. P. aeruginosa PAO I pigA and bphO (PA4116) genes were amplified from chromosomal DNA via polymerase chain reaction with a hot start protocol using the following primers, which contained the indicated and underlined restriction sites: pigABamHIfwd: 5′-CGGGATCCGATACCCTGGCCCCTGAATCC-3′, pigAXhoIrev: 5′-CCGCTCGAGTCAGGCGAAGGTACGCTCCAG-3′; bphOBamHIfwd: 5′-GCGGATCCATCTCCCCATCTCCATCGCCAGC-3′, bphOSmaIrev: 5′-TCCCCCGGGTCAGGCTTCGTCGAGAACCCATC-3′. The polymerase chain reaction products were then cut with the indicated enzymes and inserted into similarly restricted pGEX-6P-1. The integrity of the plasmid constructs was verified by complete DNA sequence determination of the insert (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). Both constructs placed the heme oxygenase gene downstream of and in frame with the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene of Schistosoma japonicum under the control of a Ptac promoter. A recognition sequence for PreScission protease is located upstream of the cloned gene. Proteolytic cleavage yields the native protein with a small N-terminal extension. Expression and purification were performed according to instructions supplied by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences) and as described before (12Frankenberg N. Mukougawa K. Kohchi T. Lagarias J.C. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Recombinant P. aeruginosa BphP was expressed using a tet promoter-driven Strep-tag system (13Skerra A. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 151: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) (IBA, Göttingen, Germany). Details of the cloning and purification will be published elsewhere. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm and using the calculated ϵ280 nm for each individual protein (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar, 15Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5048) Google Scholar). The formation of BV IXα was detected spectrophotometrically at 450 nm by converting it to bilirubin IXα (BR) using recombinant rat biliverdin reductase (BVR) (16Muramoto T. Kohchi T. Yokota A. Hwang I. Goodman H.M. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). An aliquot of ∼5 μg of crude recombinant rat BVR (expression clone was a gift of Dr. J. C. Lagarias, University of California at Davis) was added to the purified BphO·BV complex in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, 100 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.5, and the reaction was started by adding an NADPH-regenerating system containing 6.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 0.82 mm NADP+, and 1.1 unit/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The BphO·heme complex was prepared according to protocols previously described for heme·heme oxygenase complexes (3Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 17Yoshida T. Kikuchi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4224-4229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Heme was added to purified protein at a final ratio 3:1 heme:protein. Aliquots of heme (1.0–30 μm) were added to the cuvette containing 10 μm BphO and to the reference cuvette at room temperature. Spectra were recorded 5 min after heme addition. The millimolar extinction coefficient at 409 nm for the BphO·heme complex was determined using the pyridine hemochrome method (2Wilks A. Antiox. Redox Signal. 2002; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18Berry E.A. Trumpower B.L. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 161: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar). The isolated BphO·heme complex was converted to a pyridine hemochrome in a 500-μl sample volume by the addition of 62.5 μl pyridine and 62.5 μl of 0.5 n NaOH solution. The spectrum of the oxidized pyridine hemochrome was recorded. An excess of dithionite was added, and the spectrum of the reduced ferrous pyridine hemochrome was recorded. The spectrum of the reduced form minus the spectrum of the oxidized form was calculated at 557 nm. The concentration of heme was determined from the extinction coefficient using an ϵ405 nm value of 34,530 m–1 cm–1. The BphO·heme complex (1:3) was prepared as described above and applied to a hydroxylapatite column (0.5 × 1.0 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The column was washed with the same buffer, and the protein eluted in 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). The fractions containing the BphO·heme complex were dialyzed against 25 mm HEPES-KOH containing 100 mm KCl and 10% glycerol (pH 7.5). The standard assay (0.5-ml final volume) contained 10 μm BphO·heme, 0.15 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 4.6 μm ferredoxin (Spinacea, Porphyra, and Clostridium), 0.025 unit/ml spinach ferredoxin-NADP+ oxidoreductase in 25 mm HEPES-KOH buffer (pH 7.5). The reaction was started by addition of the NADPH-regenerating system listed above. Spectral changes between 300 and 800 nm were monitored for 30 min at 37 °C. Sodium ascorbate or Trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) was added to a final concentration of 5 mm unless otherwise noted. The reaction in the presence of human cytochrome P450 reductase (hCPR) was carried out as described previously by Wilks and Schmitt (3Wilks A. Schmitt M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 837-841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). When appropriate, catalase from Aspergillus niger was added to reaction cuvettes at a ratio of catalase:BphO·heme 0.5:1 immediately before the addition of reductant. BphO/PigA assay mixtures were loaded onto a Waters (Milford, MA) C18 Sep-Pak Light cartridge preconditioned as follows: 3-ml wash with acetonitrile to wet the Sep-Pak, 3-ml wash with MilliQ water, and 3-ml wash with 50 mm 4-methylmorpholine/glacial acetic acid (pH 7.7). After the sample was loaded onto the Sep-Pak, it was washed with 3 ml of 4-methylmorpholine/glacial acetic acid (pH 7.7) followed by 3 ml of 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. The tetrapyrroles were then eluted from the Sep-Pak using 2 ml of 100% acetonitrile. The eluate was dried using a Speed-Vac lyophilizer, and the dried samples were analyzed by HPLC. Samples were first dissolved in 10 μl of Me2SO and then diluted with 200 μl of the HPLC mobile phase. Following brief centrifugation and filtration through a 0.45-μm polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter, bilins were resolved by reversed phase chromatography using an Agilent Technologies 1100 liquid chromatograph. The HPLC column used for all of the analyses was a 4.6- × 250-mm Phenomenex Ultracarb 5-μm ODS20 analytical column with a 4.6- × 30-mm guard column of the same material. The mobile phase consisted of acetone:20 mm formic acid (50:50 by volume), and the flow rate was 0.6 ml/min. Eluates were monitored at 650 and 380 nm using an Agilent Technologies 1100 series diode array detector. Preparation of BphO Reconstituted with 13C-Labeled Heme—13C-Labeled δ-aminolevulinic acids (ALAs) were used as biosynthetic precursors for the preparation of protoheme IX (heme). δ-[5-13C]Aminolevulinic acid ([5-13C]ALA) and [1,2-13C]ALA were synthesized utilizing methods described previously (19Bunce R.A. Shilling III, C.L. Rivera M. J. Labelled Compd. Radiopharm. 1997; 39: 669-675Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Heme labeled with 13C was obtained utilizing previously reported methodology (9Caignan G.A. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Zeng Y. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Bunce R.A. Eastman M.A. Rivera M. J. Am. Chem.

Chem. 2004; 378: 1464-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) developed to take advantage of the fact that the first committed precursor in heme biosynthesis is ALA (23Warren M.J. Scott A.I. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 426Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, 13C-labeled heme, which was biosynthesized in Escherichia coli upon addition of suitably labeled ALA, was trapped by simultaneously expressing rat liver outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5. The details of the biosynthetic protocol, which entail the expression and purification of outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 harboring 13C-labeled heme, have been presented previously (9Caignan G.A. Deshmukh R. Wilks A. Zeng Y. Huang H.W. Moenne-Loccoz P. Bunce R.A. Eastman M.A. Rivera M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 14879-14892Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Rivera M. Walker F.A.

Chem. 2004; 378: 1464-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). 13C-Labeled heme was extracted from outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 as follows: pyridine (15 ml) was added to 2.5 ml of 1 mm outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 in phosphate buffer (μ = 0.10, pH = 7.0). Slow addition of chloroform, typically 10–12 ml, resulted in the precipitation of the polypeptide, while maintaining the pyridine hemochrome in the supernatant. The latter was subsequently separated from the denatured polypeptide by centrifugation and then dried over anhydrous MgSO4. The desiccant was removed by filtration, and the filtered pyridine-chloroform solution was transferred to a round bottom flask, where it was concentrated to dryness in a rotary evaporator. Finally, the solid was redissolved in 1.5 ml of Me2SO. BphO was reconstituted with a freshly prepared solution of 13C-labeled heme by titrating it into a 25-ml solution of phosphate buffer (μ = 0.10, pH = 7.0) containing ∼2 μmol of BphO until the ratio A280/ASoret no longer changed. The resultant solution containing the reconstituted enzyme was incubated at 4 °C overnight, then purified by size exclusion chromatography with the aid of a Sephadex G-50 column (90 × 2.6 cm inner diameter) equilibrated and eluted with 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0 at 4 °C. Fractions containing pure protein were concentrated in Amicon centrifugal concentrators to ∼1 ml and then transferred to smaller Centricon concentrators to exchange the protein into deuterated phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, not corrected for the deuterium isotope effect. NMR Spectroscopy—1H and 13C NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Unity Inova spectrometer operating at frequencies of 599.740 (1H) and 150.817 (13C) MHz, respectively. 1H spectra were referenced to the residual water peak at 4.8 ppm, and 13C spectra were referenced to an external solution of dioxane (60% v/v in D2O) at 66.66 ppm. Proton spectra were acquired with pre-saturation of the residual water peak over 10,000 data points, with a spectral width of 24 kHz, a 150-ms acquisition time, a 200-ms relaxation delay, and 1024 scans. 13C spectra were collected over 12,000 data points, with a spectral width of 60 kHz, a 100-ms acquisition time, a 25-ms relaxation delay, and 400,000 scans. HMQC spectra were typically acquired with spectral widths of 24 kHz for 1H and 50 kHz for 13C and a 200-ms relaxation delay. HMQC spectra obtained from samples containing BphO reconstituted with heme labeled at the methyl, propionate-β, and vinyl-β carbons were acquired with refocusing delays based on 1JCH = 140 Hz, whereas spectra obtained from BphO reconstituted with heme labeled at the meso carbons were acquired with 1JCH = 180 Hz. Data were collected as an array of 2,000 × 128 points with 512 scans per t1 increment and processed by zero filling once in t2 and twice in t1 to obtain an 8,000 × 8,000 matrix. This was apodized with a 90°-shifted squared sine bell function and Fourier transformed. Water-eliminated Fourier transform-NOESY (24Patt S.L. Sykes B.D. J. Chem.

The data were processed by zero filling in both dimensions to obtain an 8,000 × 8,000 matrix, apodized with 90°-shifted squared sine bell, and Fourier transformed. An Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 HR10/30 gel permeation chromatography column was equilibrated in 50 mm TES-KOH buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm KCl and 10% (v/v) glycerol (GPC buffer) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Standards with known Mr (i.e. β-amylase 200,000; alcohol dehydrogenase 150,000; bovine serum albumin 66,000; carbonic anhydrase 29,000; and cytochrome c 12,600) were applied to the column (100 μg), and their elution volumes were determined spectroscopically at 280 nm. 10 μm BphP and 10 μm estimated BV (bound to BphO) were applied to the column and chromatographed under conditions identical to those used for the standard proteins. All samples were also monitored at 650 nm for BV detection. To test chromophore assembly of BphP in vitro, 20 μm recombinant apo-BphP was incubated with 40 μm chromophore or BphO (PigA)·BV complex for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. Absorbance spectra were obtained after 3-min incubation with red light at 630 nm (Pfr spectrum) and far red light at 750 nm (Pr spectrum), respectively, in a volume of 500 μl (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 20 mm KCl, pH 8.0) using an Agilent Technologies 8453 Value Analysis UV-Visible System. Difference spectra (Pr – Pfr) were calculated. The four isomers of BV IX were obtained through coupled oxidation of heme in pyridine as described before (26Bonnett R. McDonagh A.F. J. Chem. Soc. 1973; 9: 881-888Google Scholar). The four BV isomers were separated using a semi-preparative reversed phase HPLC of the same material as described above, except that the flow rate was 2 ml/min. Expression and Purification of Recombinant P. aeruginosa Heme Oxygenases—The P. aeruginosa pigA and bphO genes were expressed using a tac promoter-driven N-terminal GST fusion expression system. All the reported results were obtained for recombinant BphO unless otherwise noted. Recombinant PigA and BphO could be purified to ∼99% homogeneity, as shown in Fig. 2A for BphO. One single band was obtained on SDS-PAGE migrating at ∼23,000, which corresponds to the predicted relative molecular weight calculated from the amino acid composition (Mr = 21,465). One liter of bacterial culture typically yielded 10 mg of purified BphO. Interestingly, expression of recombinant protein resulted in the development of a bright green color (Fig. 2B as seen by absorption at 650 nm) indicating the production of BV during the recombinant expression of BphO. The produced BV appears to have a high affinity toward BphO, because the BphO·BV complex remained stable throughout the entire purification process; however, the bound BV can be replaced by the substrate heme (see below). The production of BV was further confirmed by its conversion to bilirubin (BR) upon addition of rat biliverdin reductase (BVR). Hence, addition of BVR and NADPH to the purified BphO·BV complex resulted in the conversion of the bound BV to BR, which was accompanied by a color change from green to yellow and by the appearance of a peak at 450 nm (Fig. 2B). For additional confirmation that the production of BV was due to the action of BphO during expression, BphO was expressed under anaerobic culture conditions using nitrate as a terminal electron acceptor. Because any known HO reaction is oxygen-dependent, no formation of BV should be obtained. As expected, no color formation was observed during anaerobic expression and purification, but the spectrum of purified recombinant BphO showed a small peak around 420 nm suggesting the formation of a BphO·heme complex (Fig. 2B, inset). These observations taken together demonstrated that recombinant BphO is already active in E. coli, where it must interact with a reducing agent. The nature of this reductant, however, remains to be elucidated. Heme Binds to BphO—The formation of a BphO·heme complex was determined by difference spectroscopy. To this end, equal aliquots of hemin were added to the sample cuvette containing the BV complex of BphO in buffer and to the reference cuvette containing only buffer. Addition of hemin to BphO resulted in the replacement of BV, which was evident from a change in color of the solution, from green to brownish red. The electronic absorption spectrum of the BphO·heme complex is different from that of the BphO·BV complex and from that of free heme in solution (Fig. 3). The BphO·heme complex has a Soret band at 409 nm, which is close to that reported for other bacterial HO·heme complexes (27Migita C.T. Zhang X. Yoshida T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2003; 270: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Attempts to calculate the dissociation constant (Kd) did not result in reliable data, which is most likely a consequence of competition between BV and hemin for the binding site in BphO. Efforts to remove the relatively tightly bound BV from BphO prior to the titration experiments failed. The extinction coefficient of the BphO·heme complex was found to be 97.6 mm–1 cm–1, a value that appears to be the lowest reported for a bacterial HO. Spectroscopic Characterization of the Catalytic Turnover of the BphO·heme Complex—The catalytic turnover of the ferric BphO·heme complex in the presence of spinach ferredoxin and a ferredoxin reductase system (i.e. ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase and a NADPH-regenerating system) was measured spectrophotometrically. In the presence of reduced spinach ferredoxin the BphO·heme complex was immediately converted to the oxyferrous complex, which was accompanied by a shift in the Soret band from 409 to 412 nm and by the appearance of β/α-bands at 545 and 579 nm, respectively (Fig. 4A). Within 30 min the oxyferrous complex was fully degraded to ferric-BV (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, when the reaction mixture contains the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase in addition to Fd, to rule out non-enzymatic coupled oxidation of the BphO·heme complex, the reaction proceeded much slower and was arrested at the oxyferrous stage; the latter remained stable over at least 30 min (Fig. 4B). Because it has been reported that for some bacterial HOs the Fd-dependent conversion of heme to BV requires a second reductant such as ascorbate (28Cornejo J. Willows R.D. Beale S.I. Plant J. 1998; 15: 99-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), ascorbate or Trolox was added to the arrested reaction. This resulted in the full conversion of the oxyferrous complex to iron-free BV, as was evident from the development of green color and from the appearance of a peak at 680 nm (Fig. 4C). In comparison, ascorbate by itself supported the oxidation of the BphO·heme complex to ferric (Fe3+-) BV (Fig. 4D). Addition of catalase to the ascorbate-mediated heme degradation did not alter the reaction. To distinguish the observed spectral changes from a coupled oxidation reaction, the BphO·heme complex was incubated with 30 or 300 μm H2O2, respectively. Only the high concentration of H2O2 promoted the coupled oxidation reaction, which resulted in the formation of Fe3+-verdoheme (Table I). If the same reaction also contained catalase, no heme degradation was observed, which confirmed that in the presence of peroxides heme in the BphO·heme complex was degraded via coupled oxidation.Table ITested reductants in the BphO assayReductantConcentrationVisible intermediatesFinal productFerredoxin spinach [2Fe-2S]4.6 μmOxyferrous complex (Fe2+-O2) (545 nm, 579 nm)Ferric-biliverdin (Fe3+-BV)aBV, biliverdin; Fe3+-BV, ferric-biliverdin; Fe2+-O2, oxyferrous complex.Ferredoxin Clostridium [4Fe-4S]4.6 μmFe2+-O2 (545 nm, 579 nm)Fe3+-BVFerredoxin Porphyra [2Fe-2S]4.6 μmFe2+-O2 (545 nm, 579 nm)Fe3+-BVSodium ascorbate5 mmBphO-heme complex degradationFe3+-BVTrolox5 mmNDbND, nothing detected.H2O230 μmNDH2O2300 μmFe3+-verdohemeH2O2300 μmCatalaseNDFerredoxin spinach4.6 μmBphO-heme complex degradationBVAscorbate5 mmFerredoxin Clostridium4.6 μmBphO-heme complex degradationBVAscorbate5 mmFerredoxin Porphyra4.6 μmBphO-heme complex degradationBVAscorbate5 mmFerredoxin spinach4.6 μmBphO-heme complex degradationBVTrolox5 mmFerredoxin spinach4.6 μmCatalase5 μmFe"

We showed recently the involvement of a novel protein, Ayg1p, in the formation of T4HN from the heptaketide precursor YWA1 in Aspergillus fumigatus. To investigate the mechanism of its enzymatic function, Ayg1p was purified from an Aspergillus oryzae strain that overexpressed the ayg1 gene. The Ayg1p converted the naphthopyrone YWA1 to T4HN with a release of the acetoacetic acid. Although Ayg1p does not show significant homology with known enzymes, a serine protease-type hydrolytic motif is present in its sequence, and serine-specific inhibitors strongly inhibited the activity. To identify its catalytic residues, site-directed Ayg1p mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their enzyme activities were examined. The single substitution mutations S257A, D352A, and H380A resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity in Ayg1p. These results indicated that the catalytic triad Asp352-His380-Ser257 constituted the active-site of Ayg1p. From a Dixon plot analysis, 2-acetyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene was found to be a strong mixed-type inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. These studies support the mechanism in which the Ser257 at the active site functions as a nucleophile to attack the YWA1 side-chain 1′-carbonyl and cleave the carbon-carbon bond between the naphthalene ring and the side chain.

Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brown and black fungi, DHN is a pentaketide biosynthesized from the precursor 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (T4HN) by successive reduction and dehydration (5Wheeler M.H. Bell A.A. McGinnis M.R. Current Topics in Medical Mycology. 2. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). T4HN was determined to be a product of the pentaketide synthase PKS1 in the black fungus Colletotrichum lagenarium (6Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 7Fujii I. Mori Y. Watanabe A. Kubo Y. Tsuji G. Ebizuka Y. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8853-8858Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In A. fumigatus, genetic and biochemical investigations showed that its conidial polyketide melanin biosynthesis required a six-gene cluster that included the genes abr1, abr2, alb1, arp1, arp2, and ayg1 (4Tsai H.-F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The products of these genes are referred to as Abr1p, Abr2p, Alb1p, Arp1p, Arp2p, and Ayg1p. A homology search suggested that arp2 and arp1 code for T4HN reductase and scytalone dehydratase, respectively, and that abr1 and abr2 encode multi-copper oxidases. Heterologous expression of alb1 in Aspergillus oryzae demonstrated that the Alb1p polyketide synthase synthesized the heptaketide naphthopyrone YWA1 (8Watanabe A. Fujii I. Tsai H.-F. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. Ebizuka Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 192: 39-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which was identified as a precursor of the green spore pigment in Aspergillus nidulans (9Watanabe A. Fujii I. Sankawa U. Mayorga M.E. Timberlake W.E. Ebizuka Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 91-94Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The ayg1 gene in the biosynthetic gene cluster, however, showed no significant homology with known genes in the data base. Genetic analyses suggested that Ayg1p catalyzes the biosynthetic step subsequent to the Alb1p polyketide synthase reaction. In our previous study, we reported that the Ayg1p cell-free extracts prepared from an A. oryzae transformed with pTA-ayg1 could convert the heptaketide YWA1 to the pentaketide T4HN (10Tsai H.-F. Fujii I. Watanabe A. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Yasuoka Y. Ebizuka Y. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29292-29298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This suggested that the novel protein Ayg1p is involved in T4HN formation by chain-length shortening of a heptaketide YWA1 in A. fumigatus. (Fig. 1) In this report, we purified and characterized the Ayg1p from the fungal transformant that overexpressed the protein. Using the homogeneously purified Ayg1p, we identified acetoacetic acid as the in vitro reaction product derived from the YWA1 side chain. This result indicated the hydrolytic cleavage of the carbon-carbon bond between the naphthalene nucleus and the side-chain 1′-carbonyl of the YWA1 open form. From the kinetic studies and site-directed mutagenesis analyses, we identified the catalytic domain of Ayg1p as being responsible for the enzymatic activity and proposed an unusual mechanism of hydrolytic polyketide shortening for T4HN formation. Materials—YWA1 was obtained from the culture extract of an A. oryzae transformant with pTA-alb1 (11Watanabe A. Ebizuka Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 843-846Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). 2-Acetyl-1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (ATHN) was prepared from the culture extract of an A. oryzae transformed with pTA-sw-B (11Watanabe A. Ebizuka Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 2002; 43: 843-846Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Benzamidine and 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin were purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Wako (Tokyo, Japan). Ayg1p Enzyme Assay—Ayg1p enzyme activity was assayed spectrophotometrically as follows. Fifty microliters of 1 mm YWA1 dissolved in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether and 50 μl of the enzyme solution were added to 900 μl of degassed assay buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5). The decrease of A406 was then monitored at 30 °C. Reaction velocities were calculated based on the A406 molar absorption coefficient of YWA1 (ϵ = 1.1 × 104). Purification of Ayg1p—All purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Unless stated otherwise, 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was used throughout the purification. For the purification of Ayg1p, 270 g of induction culture mycelia of the A. oryzae strain transformed with pTA-ayg1 (10Tsai H.-F. Fujii I. Watanabe A. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Yasuoka Y. Ebizuka Y.

One-tenth weight of Polyclar AT (Gokyo Sangyo, Tokyo, Japan) was added to the homogenate and placed on ice for 30 min. After filtering through four-layered gauze, the homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was used as a crude extract for further purification. Precipitates between 30 and 80% ammonium sulfate saturation were dissolved in the buffer and dialyzed overnight against 5 liters of the buffer containing 100 μm benzamidine and 1.1 m ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied onto a Butyl-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column (2.2 × 6 cm) equilibrated with the buffer containing 1.1 m ammonium sulfate. The column was then washed with the equilibration buffer. Active Ayg1p was eluted with the buffer containing 0.8 m ammonium sulfate. The active fraction pooled (92 ml) was dialyzed against 5 liters of the buffer containing 100 μm benzamidine and then concentrated by ultrafiltration using Centriprep YM-30 (Amicon). Ayg1p was purified on Mono Q HR 10/10 anion exchange column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the buffer using the ÄKTA explorer system (Amersham Biosciences). Ayg1p was eluted with ∼70 mm NaCl. The pooled active fraction was concentrated with Centriprep YM-30 and purified by gel filtration on Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with the buffer containing 0.2 m NaCl. From 270 g of mycelia, 15 mg of the purified Ayg1p was obtained with 10% recovery of activity.

Open table in a new tab Derivatization of Acetoacetic Acid—Fifty microliters of substrate YWA1 solution (2 mm dissolved in ethylene glycol monomethyl ether) and 50 μl of the purified Ayg1p (0.4 nmol) were added to 900 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. Five mg of O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine hydrochloride (12Cancilla D.A. Que Hee S.S. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 627: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and 1 ml of H2O were then added to the reaction mixture. The reaction mixture was adjusted to pH 2–3 with 0.5 m H2SO4 and left at room temperature for 2 h. After extraction with n-hexane, the product was desiccated with N2 gas and redissolved in 50 μl of methanol. Analysis by Liquid Chromatography-coupled Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS)—The methanol solution of the Ayg1p reaction product derivatized with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl) hydroxylamine was analyzed by an ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, ThermoQuest) with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) coupled to a TSK-Gel ODS-80Ts column (Tosoh, Japan; 4.6 × 150 mm). The HPLC conditions were a gradient system of 25–100% (v/v) methanol in water (each containing 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid) within 30 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 40 °C. HPLC Analysis of Enzymatic Products from Substrate Analogs—To investigate the substrate specificity of Ayg1p, the aryl alkyl ketone compounds were reacted with Ayg1p under standard assay conditions. After incubation with the purified Ayg1p at 30 °C for 15 min, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC on an ODS-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm) with a gradient system of 5–100% (v/v) acetonitrile in water (each containing 0.5% (v/v) acetic acid) within 30 min at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min at 40 °C. The formation of T4HN and flaviolin was analyzed by LC-APCI-MS coupled to an ODS-80Ts column (4.6 × 150 mm) with the same gradient condition. Expression of the Wild-type and Mutated Ayg1 Genes in Escherichia coli—The full-length ayg1 cDNA was amplified by AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) from the plasmid pGC31, which contains cDNA lacking the N-terminal 15 bp of the ayg1 coding sequence, using the forward primer 5′-ATCCATGGGCAGCAGCCACCACCACCACCACCACCACCACGGCTCCGGTGATGACGACGACAAGCCACGCTGGATCCTTGGAGACAAGTTC-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-TCAGATCTCTCGATCAGTTCTTCGTCTTC-3′. The NcoI site, the His8 tag, and the enterokinase recognition amino acid sequence (DDDDK) were designed in the forward primer, and the BglII site was in the reverse primer. The resulting 1.3-kbp PCR product was purified by the Wizard PCR Prep kit (Promega) and subcloned with pT7 Blue T-vector (Novagen). After sequence confirmation, the correct insert was cleaved by NcoI and BglII digestion and ligated into NcoI/BamH1-digested pET-3d to construct pET-ayg1Ht. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE transformed with pET-ayg1Ht was grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.5. The culture was cooled to 30 °C, and expression was induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside by incubating at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 10 min) were resuspended in ice-cold 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 μg/ml lysozyme and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. After sonication, the soluble fraction was obtained by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), which showed YWA1 conversion activity. No activity was detected in the control preparation obtained from E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE harboring the pET-3d empty vector. Among the induction conditions tested (26∼30 °C for 3∼16 h), the highest specific activity was observed when induction was carried out at 30 °C for 3 h. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions on the plasmid pET-ayg1Ht with a pair of primers as follows (mutated codons are underlined): T185V (5′-CATCGTGCTGATCATGGTGGGCCTAGACGGGTA-3′ and 5′-TACCCGTCTAGGCCCACCATGATCAGCACGATG-3′); E212Q (5′-CTGTCGTCGCCCAGATCCCCGGCAC-3′ and its antisense); S257A (5′-GGTGTGGGGACTGGCGGCGGGCGGGTACT-3′ and its antisense); R271L (5′-GCGCATACGCACCTGGACCGGCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAGCCGGTCCAGGTGCGTATGCGC-3′); D352A (5′-TGGGGTCGACGCTGGCGTCGTGC-3′ and its antisense); H380A (5′-CTACAAGGGGCTCCCGGCAATGGGATATCCCAACAGT-3′ and its antisense). Mutations were verified by sequencing. The plasmids containing mutated ayg1 genes were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)LysE, and mutant ayg1 genes were expressed in the same way as described for the expression of the wild-type ayg1. Purification of these wild-type and mutated Ayg1ps with an His8 tag was carried out by Ni2+-affinity using Probond resin (Invitrogen) or a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid spin column (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Further purification of the wild-type and S257A-mutated Ayg1p were performed on Mono Q HR 5/5 anion exchange column on the ÄKTA Explorer system. Other Methods—Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (13Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (215632) Google Scholar). The concentration of purified enzyme was determined by the UV absorption method. SDS-PAGE was performed on 11% acrylamide gels by the method of Laemmli (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207012) Google Scholar). Gels were stained with GelCode Blue Stain Reagent (Pierce). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified Ayg1p was carried out by APRO Life Science Institute, Inc. (Tokushima, Japan). CD spectra were recorded by Shimadzu-AVIV CD 202. Purification of Ayg1p—A cell-free extract was prepared from 270 g of the mycelia of A. oryzae transformed with pTA-ayg1, which had been cultured in a starch-containing induction medium for 3 days. Ayglp was purified in four steps, i.e. ammonium sulfate fractionation, Butyl-Sepharose hydrophobic chromatography, Mono Q anion exchange chromatography, and Superose 12 size exclusion chromatography. Fifteen milligrams of purified Ayg1p was obtained from 270 g mycelia as summarized in Table I. The purified Ayg1p eluted as a single peak at 90 kDa on Superose 12 chromatography and appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE at 45 kDa as shown in Fig. 2, indicating that Ayg1p is a dimer in its native form. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed a single sequence, Pro-Arg-Trp-Ile-Leu, which is identical with the N-terminal sequence of Ayg1p as deduced from its gene sequence, excluding the initial methionine. These results clearly proved the homogeneity and identity of the purified Ayg1p. Identification of Reaction Products—In a previous paper we reported the formation of the pentaketide T4HN from the heptaketide YWA1 by reaction with the crude cell-free extract containing Ayg1p (10Tsai H.-F. Fujii I. Watanabe A. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Yasuoka Y. Ebizuka Y. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29292-29298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To definitely confirm the reaction products, YWA1 was reacted with the homogeneously purified Ayg1p. As shown in Fig. 3, HPLC analysis of the reaction mixture showed two products with retention times of 15.4 and 18.3 min. These products were identified as T4HN and flaviolin, respectively, by LC-APCI-MS analysis as reported previously (15Funa N. Ohnishi Y. Fujii I. Shibuya M. Ebizuka Y. Horinouchi S. Nature. 1999; 400: 897-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Flaviolin was formed by the autooxidation of T4HN. As T4HN was identified to be the product from YWA1, diketide acetoacetic acid was proposed to be the another product from the side chain of YWA1. Because of the instability of acetoacetic acid to heat and/or acid, identification of acetoacetic acid was carried out after derivatization. It is known that 3-keto acids can react with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride to give stable oxime derivatives with benzyl chromophore (12Cancilla D.A. Que Hee S.S. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 627: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The Ayg1p reaction mixture was treated with O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine, and the oxime product formed was analyzed by LC-MS. Mass chromatogram analysis at m/z 298, which corresponds to the [M+H]+ of acetoacetic acid oxime, showed a single peak at a retention time of 27.8 min. MS/MS analysis of this parent ion m/z 298 gave ions of m/z 284 ([M-COOH+CH3OH]+), m/z 270 ([M-COOH+H2O]+), and m/z 252 ([M-COOH]+). Because these LC-MS/MS data were identical to those of standard acetoacetic acid oxime and no m/z 298 ion was detected in the reaction mixture at zero time, we concluded that acetoacetic acid is formed by hydrolytic cleavage of the YWA1 side chain.

The metal chelating reagent EDTA did not affect the enzyme activity of Ayg1p. Also, sulfhydryl reagents like iodoacetic acid and N-ethylmaleimide showed no effect. On the other hand, serine protease inhibitors strongly inhibited Ayg1p activity. Especially, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin (16Harper J.W. Hemmi K. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) showed a 32% inhibition of Ayg1p activity even at 2 μm. These results suggested that serine residues have a critical role in Ayg1p reaction as proposed previously (10Tsai H.-F. Fujii I. Watanabe A. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Yasuoka Y. Ebizuka Y.

Open table in a new tab Substrate Specificity—The heptaketide naphthopyrone YWA1 is a natural substrate of Ayg1p. Because YWA2, a dehydrated derivative of YWA1, did not react with Ayg1p, Ayg1p is considered to react with the side-chain open form of YWA1. Thus, aryl alkyl ketone compounds were tested for their reactivity with Ayg1p. (Fig. 6) Of the compounds tested, only ATHN reacted with Ayg1p. The conversion of norsolorinic acid, ethyl coumarin-3-carboxylate, phenyl butanedione, and acetophenones could not be catalyzed by Ayg1p. Although the reactivity of ATHN with Ayg1p was only 5% of the reactivity of YWA1, T4HN was identified by HPLC and LC-MS analysis as the product from ATHN (data not shown). Kinetic Analysis of Ayg1p Reaction—Ayg1p reaction velocities were determined using 2.5 pmol of purified Ayg1p in the standard assay condition with variable concentrations of YWA1 from 5 to 100 μm. From the Eadie-Hofstee plot of these data, Km and kcat values for YWA1 were determined to be 44 μm and 4.6 s–1, respectively. From the substrate specificity studies, ATHN was found to be a substrate of Ayg1p, although its reactivity was very low. In contrast, ATHN was found to be a strong inhibitor against the conversion of YWA1 by Ayg1p. Dixon plot analysis of ATHN inhibition kinetics indicated that ATHN acts as a mixed-type inhibitor with a Ki value of 1.7 μm. (Fig. 7) Site-directed Mutagenesis—Ayg1p converts YWA1 to T4HN and acetoacetic acid formally by adding one molecule of H2O. Although Ayg1p does not show significant homology with functionally characterized enzymes in the data base, Ayg1p has a serine protease-type motif (-kmVVwGlS257AGGYyA-), suggesting hydrolytic cleavage of the YWA1 side chain by Ayg1p. A conserved domain search indicated the presence of a dipeptidyl aminopeptidase/acylaminoacyl-peptidase domain (DAP2, COG1506) and/or a esterase/lipase domain (Aes, COG0657) (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml). Alignment of Ayg1p with Aes family proteins indicated the amino acid residues around Ser257 to be highly conserved. Alignment with DAP2 family proteins also indicated the conserved Asp352 and His380 near the C terminus of Ayg1p. Of these conserved amino acid residues, Thr185, Glu212, Ser257, Arg271, Asp352, and His380 were chosen as target amino acids to introduce mutations. The wild-type Ayg1p with an His8 tag expressed in E. coli showed YWA1 conversion activity to have kinetics similar to those of Ayg1p expressed in A. oryzae. The S257A-mutated Ayg1p completely lost its YWA1-converting activity. Inactivation of the S257A Ayg1p did not result from secondary structure alteration, because the CD spectra of Mono Q-purified S257A and wild-type Ayg1p were identical (data not shown). The Ser257, therefore, is considered to be a critical residue of the active site involved in the Ayg1p reaction. In addition, D352A- and H380A-mutated Ayg1p also had no detectable activities. In contrast, T185V- and R271V-mutated Ayg1p retained ∼30% activities compared with the wild-type Ayg1p. (Fig. 8) The novel enzyme Ayg1p was purified and characterized for analysis of its catalytic mechanism. Ayg1p catalyzes the carbon-carbon bond cleavage of the heptaketide naphthopyrone YWA1 to release the pentaketide T4HN and the diketide acetoacetic acid. In polyketide biosynthesis, basic carbon skeletons of polyketides are generally determined by polyketide synthases alone. Although tailoring enzymes modify the basic skeletons by hydroxylation, alkylation, oxidation, etc., such modifications are not so drastic, and the basic carbon skeletons are usually retained in their final products (17O'Hagen D. The Polyketide Metabolites. Ellis Horwood, New York1991Google Scholar). Thus, the polyketide-shortening reaction catalyzed by Ayg1p is highly unusual in polyketide biosynthesis. The naphthopyrone YWA1 is considered to be a precursor of green spore pigment in aspergilli such as A. nidulans (9Watanabe A. Fujii I. Sankawa U. Mayorga M.E. Timberlake W.E. Ebizuka Y. Tetrahedron Lett. 1999; 40: 91-94Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). T4HN has been established as the precursor of DHN-melanin in black fungi (5Wheeler M.H. Bell A.A. McGinnis M.R. Current Topics in Medical Mycology. 2. Springer-Verlag, New York1988Google Scholar). In contrast to these fungi with green or black conidial pigmentation, A. fumigatus shows the characteristic bluish green pigmentation. In the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for conidial pigmentation in A. fumigatus, there are two copper oxidase genes, abr1 and abr2 (4Tsai H.-F. Wheeler M.H. Chang Y.C. Kwon-Chung K.J. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6469-6477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). If these two oxidases could polymerize DHN for black DHN-melanin and YWA1 for green spore pigments, respectively, A. fumigatus could use the single gene cluster for the biosynthesis of two different pigments. Thus, Ayg1p may play a critical role in providing the appropriate substrates required for the two biosynthetic pathways, and the combination of two different pigments may result in bluish green conidia in A. fumigatus. The identification of acetoacetic acid as a product in the Ayg1p reaction with YWA1 indicated that the carbon-carbon bond between the naphthalene aromatic ring and the sidechain carbonyl is cleaved hydrolytically. There are only a few enzymes that catalyze the hydrolytic carbon-carbon bond cleavage. These enzymes are classified by the Enzyme Commission on Nomenclature as the hydrolase group (E.C. 3.7.1. X), which includes fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (18Timm D.E. Mueller H.A. Bhanumoorthy P. Harp J.M. Bunick G.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1023-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), kynureninase (19Momany C. Levdikov V. Blagova L. Lima S. Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and β-diketone hydrolase (20Grogan G. J. Mol. Catal. B Enzym. 2002; 19-20: 73-82Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase is a typical β-keto acid hydrolase that converts fumarylacetoacetate to fumarate and acetoacetate. The structure of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, which was resolved recently, suggested that the substrate carbonyl carbon atom is attacked by a nucleophilic water molecule that is activated by histidine imidazole as a general base and that the Ca2+ ion, as a cofactor, serves for substrate recognition (18Timm D.E. Mueller H.A. Bhanumoorthy P. Harp J.M. Bunick G.J. Structure. 1999; 7: 1023-1033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Oxo-camphor hydrolase is a β-diketone hydrolase that converts 6-oxo-camphor to α-campholinic acid. The enzyme from Rhodococcus sp. showed significant homology to the superfamily of enzymes known as crotonases (21Grogan G. Roberts G.A. Bougioukou D. Turner N.J. Flitsch S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 12566-12572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Based on the mechanism of enoyl-CoA hydrolase, a typical crotonase, it was proposed that cleavage of 6-oxo-camphor carbon-carbon bond proceeds via nucleophilic attack at one carbonyl by a water molecule activated by an acidic residue in the active site of the enzyme. From the structure determined by x-ray crystallography, the Glu244 or Asp154 residue is considered to be responsible for the activation of a water molecule to attack the substrate's carbonyl carbon (22Whittingham J.L. Turkenburg J.P. Verma C.S. Walsh M.A. Grogan G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 1744-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In addition to the β-diketone hydrolases mentioned above, there is a group of hydrolases that are involved in the degradation of various aromatic compounds including xylene and toluene. These are, e.g. Pseudomonas putida TodF (23Menn F.M. Zylstra G.J. Gibson D.T. Gene. 1991; 104: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and XylF (24Díaz E. Timmis K. J. Biol.

Microbiol. 1996; 62: 4471-4477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and E. coli MhpC (30Lam W.W.Y. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12242-12251Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Their substrates are ketonic ring fission products of aromatic compounds and are hydrolytically converted to smaller molecules. These proteins belong to the α/β-hydrolase family and they all contain a catalytic triad composed of a serine, an aspartate, and a histidine residue. These residues are borne on a series of loops that are the best conserved structural features of the fold. MhpC is 2-hydroxy-6-keto-nona-2,4-diene 1,9-dioic acid 5,6-hydrolase involved in the E. coli phenylpropionate catabolic pathway, which is a dimeric protein that requires no cofactors for activity. The catalytic mechanism of carbon-carbon bond cleavage by MhpC was studied in detail, and the gem-diol intermediate was proposed instead of the acyl enzyme intermediate in which the active site serine works as a general base to assist water in attacking carbonyl (31Fleming S.M. Robertson T.A. Langley G.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). MhpC is active at low pH, a behavior that is consistent with the formation of a gem-diol intermediate. Flemming et al. (31Fleming S.M. Robertson T.A. Langley G.J. Bugg T.D.H. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1522-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) also suggested that a general base mechanism would be a realistic alternative in α/β-hydrolase family reactions (Fig. 9). By 3D-PSSM (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/~3dssm/), a web-based program for protein fold recognition, significant matches indicated that Ayg1p also belongs to the α/β-hydrolase family. In contrast to MhpC, Ayg1p lost its activity at a pH <5.5 (data not shown). In addition, 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and ATHN were found to inhibit Ayg1p activity. The former is known as a mechanism-based serine protease inhibitor that forms covalently acylated enzyme (16Harper J.W. Hemmi K. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1831-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). The latter, a substrate analog with 5% reactivity of the natural substrate YWA1, could function as an inhibitor against the Ayg1p activity that converts YWA1 to T4HN. Dixon plot analysis showed that ATHN inhibition against YWA1 is of mixed type with a Ki value of 1.7 μm. (Fig. 7) These results indicated that ATHN not only competes with YWA1 in the enzyme active site but also interacts with the active site residue, possibly by acetylating the active site serine residue. Thus, ATHN could be a strong inhibitor against YWA1 by releasing acetic acid from an acetylated enzyme at a far slower rate than the release of acetoacetic acid from acetoacetylated enzyme. These results favor the catalytic mechanism in which the active site serine residue of Ayg1p works not as a general base but as a nucleophile to attack the side-chain 1′-carbonyl of YWA1. Site-directed mutagenesis did indeed confirmed that Ser257 is the critical active site residue of Ayg1p. The mutations T185V and R271L, which were designed from alignment with the Aes protein family, did not inactivate but did reduce the Ayg1p activity. The mutations D352A and H380A, however, resulted in a complete loss of enzyme activity. (Fig. 8) These results indicated that the Ayg1p is a DAP2 family protein with α/β-hydrolase fold and that its catalytic triad Asp352-His380-Ser257 is involved in the hydrolytic carbon-carbon bond cleavage of YWA1. Thus, the mechanism of the Ayg1p reaction is proposed as follows. Naphthopyrone YWA1 is in equilibrium with the side-chain open form, that is, 2-acetoacetyl T4HN. The Ser257 hydroxy anion of Ayg1p attacks the 1′-carbonyl of the open-chain form YWA1 to yield an oxyanion intermediate. Then, the carbon-carbon bond is cleaved between the naphthalene aromatic ring and the side chain when the oxyanion intermediate backs to carbonyl to give T4HN and acetoacetylated Ayg1p. The acetoacetylated Ayg1p is then hydrolyzed to acetoacetic acid and free Ayg1p as depicted in Fig. 10. As far as we are aware, an enzyme with activity similar to that of Ayg1p has not been reported in melanin biosynthesis in any other organism."
https://openalex.org/W1996781482,"The molecular cascade of stress response in higher eukaryotes commences in the cytoplasm with the trimerization of the heat shock factor 1 (HSF1), followed by its transport to the nucleus, where it binds to the heat shock element leading to the activation of transcription from the down-stream gene(s).

The developmental and tissue-specific control of the heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) and their interactions with heat shock promoters remain unexplored.

Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar). There are four known HSFs (HSF1, HSF2, HSF3, and HSF4). HSF3 is an avian HSF (3Morimoto R.I.

Although yeast and Drosophila melanogaster have a single gene that encodes an HSF, higher eukaryotes, animals, and plants have multiple genes that code for HSFs (4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar, 5Sorger P.K. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1988; 54: 855-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 6Wiederrecht G. Seto D. Parker C.S. Cell. 1988; 54: 841-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). HSF1 and HSF2 transcription factors have almost identical gene structures (4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The heat shock response starts with the cytoplasmic HSF and its trimerization and transport to the nucleus, where it binds to the heat shock element (HSE) in the heat shock promoter, activating transcription of the down stream heat shock gene(s) (1Morimoto R.I. Kroeger P.E. Cotto J.J. Feige U. Morimoto R.I. Yahara I. Polla B. Stress-inducible Cellular Responses. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1996Google Scholar, 4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). Both HSF1 and HSF2 contain three hydrophobic repeats, HR-A, -B, and -C. HR-A and -B are involved in trimerization upon reception of the stress signal. HR-C, located at the carboxyl terminus, has been suggested to inhibit trimerization in the uninduced state. HSF4, on the other hand, does not contain the HR-C domain; it therefore exists as a trimeric unit and binds to the DNA constitutively (for review, see Ref. 4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). HSF1 is considered to be the universal HSF and mediates expression of heat shock genes upon reception of a stress signal such as high temperature, whereas HSF2 is associated with developmental control. Although it has not been experimentally established, the assumption in this generalization is that all tissues and cells contain HSF1 as a pre-existing HSF in the cytoplasm to enable a cell or a tissue to mount a response to heat shock or stress. Furthermore, it is not yet clear whether each HSF activates a distinct set of target genes. The mechanism of the activation of heat shock promoter in response to stress, mostly studied in cultured cells, has been well elucidated; however, the developmental control of the heat shock promoter is not yet understood. It is clear, however, that the heat shock factors (7Jedlicka P. Mortin M.A. Wu C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2452-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and heat shock proteins do have developmental roles (8Heikkila J.J. Dev.

The only heat shock factor in the fission yeast is known to be required for growth at normal temperatures as well (12Gallo G.J. Prentice H. Kingston R.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 749-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that the increased expression of the small heat shock protein gene αB-crystallin in the postnatal (PN) rat ocular lens coincides with the appearance of a trimeric HSF-HSE complex that is formed between HSFs and the heat shock element (HSE-αB) present in the heat shock promoter of the αB-crystallin gene (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 14Srinivasan A.N. Bhat S.P. DNA Cell Biol. 1994; 13: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). This trimeric complex appears in a developmentally (temporally) controlled fashion with highest efficiency around PN day 10, complementing the increased αB-crystallin expression at this stage. It is noteworthy that HSE-αB is a canonical heat shock element (2Wu C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 441-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (982) Google Scholar, 13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), yet the appearance of the trimeric complex, as assessed by gel mobility shift assays, is developmentally dictated (absent in the fetal lens and appearing only in the postnatal lens) and tissue-specific (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To understand the developmental control of the heat shock promoter of the αB-crystallin gene and identify the HSF that interacts with this promoter, we studied the expression of three members of the mammalian HSFs, HSF1, HSF2, and HSF4, in the rat lens. We show that there is very little HSF1 or HSF2 in the postnatal adult lens and that HSF4 predominates. Further, gel mobility binding assays done with [32P]HSE-αB and nuclear extracts of the fetal as well as postnatal lens tissues reveal that the heat shock promoter of the αB-crystallin gene selectively binds to HSF4 and not to HSF1 or HSF2. We further compared HSF4 binding activity in the PN day 10 nuclear extracts using three heat shock elements derived from three different heat shock promoters. These data revealed promoter specific HSF4 binding characteristics. Animals—Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA). For fetal tissues, rats pregnant for 18 days were sacrificed under ether, and the fetuses were dissected out and the organs harvested. Newborn rat pups of different ages were similarly sacrificed and different organs were harvested for the preparation of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Human lenses were procured from the local eye banks (15Bhat S.P. Horwitz J. Srinivasan A. Ding L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 775-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). All the animal experiments were done in accordance with the guidelines set by Animal Research Committee, UCLA. Human lens materials were used according to the guidelines of the Institutional Review Board, UCLA. Antibodies—Antibodies for HSF1 and HSF2 were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). These are rat anti-HSF1 and anti-HSF2 monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant mouse full-length HSF1 and HSF2. Previously used (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) anti-HSF1 antibody (Affinity Bioreagents Inc., Golden, CO) cross-reacts with HSF4 (data not shown). Antibodies for HSF4 (total) and for HSF4b (specific for HSF4b isoform) were custom made (Sigma-Genosys). For HSF4 (total), polyclonal antiserum was raised against a 15-amino acid peptide YNVTESNASYLDPGA (473–487 residues, GenBank accession number AB029349) from the C terminus of the mouse protein. For HSF4b-specific polyclonal antiserum, the peptide CRRVKGLALLKEEPA (283–297 residues; GenBank accession number AB029349) from the mouse HSF4 protein was used. The antibodies were characterized by immunoblotting and competition with the authentic original peptide and a nonspecific peptide. Primers and Probes—Oligonucleotides of various lengths were synthesized on a DNA synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) or purchased from commercial sources (Invitrogen Inc. Carlsbad CA). The oligonucleotide pairs used for PCR amplification are as follows: HSF1, 5′-AAGCCTGAGAGGGATGACAC-3′ (41–60) and 5′-TTCGACTGCACCAGTGAGAT-3′ (369–350) (GenBank™ accession number X83094). HSF2, 5′-GGCTAACAATGAAGCAGAGT-3′ (22–41) and 5′-AACTCTGACACCTCCTTCCA-3′ (521–501) (GenBank™ accession number NM-031694). HSF4, 5′-AAGGTGGTGAGCATCGAGCA-3′ (248–267) and 5′-AGACACTGGATCAGCTTGCC-3′ (808–789) (GenBank™ accession AB029349). The number in parentheses after the sequence of each primer indicates the nucleotide positions. The oligonucleotides used for gel shift mobility assays are as follows (only the sense strand sequence is given): 1) HSE-αB; 5′-TGACATCACCGTTCCAGAAGCTTCACAAGA-3′ (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar); 2) HSE-Hsp82, 5′-TGGCATCCAGAAGCCTCTAGAAGTTTCTAGAGACTTCCAGTTCGGG-3′; and 3) HSE-Hsp70, 5′-CAGACCCGAAACTGCTGGAAGATTCTTGGCCCCAAG-3′. The underlined sequences denote the pentameric, 5′-NGAAN-3′ motifs. The oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs Inc. Beverly MA.) using [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life and Analytical Sciences) according to the manufacturers protocol. The labeled oligonucleotides were annealed to the unlabeled complementary sequences in equimolar quantities, and double-stranded probes were used for gel shift (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Preparation of Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extracts—Rat tissues were processed using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents from Pierce Biotechnology with minor modifications, including washing of the nuclear pellets three times with cytoplasmic extraction buffer to avoid residual cytoplasmic proteins contaminating the nuclear fraction. Approximately 250–300 mg of tissues were used for each extraction. Proteins were estimated using the micro BCA reagents (Pierce Biotechnology). For total cell extracts, cortical scrapings of human lenses were homogenized in 2% SDS and stored at –80 °C. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Electrophoresis of the various extracts was performed under denaturing reducing conditions using the 12% Nu-PAGE Bis-Tris gels using MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). About 40–50 μg of protein was used per lane for analyses as per the manufacturer's instructions. The electrophoresis was run for about 90 min at 200 V. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to BA83 PROTRAN membranes (Schleicher & Schüll) using the Surelock Xcell II transfer system (Invitrogen). The blotted membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline (0.1 m Tris/0.9% saline) containing Tween 20 (0.1%) briefly and used for probing with antibodies or stored at 4 °C. The immunoblotting was performed using the West-Dura chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce Biotechnology). The blots were blocked with SuperBlock in Tris-buffered saline for 90 min followed by incubation with the primary antibody (1:5000 for HSF1 and HSF2 and 1:9000 for HSF4) in the same buffer for 90 min, followed by five washes (5 min each) using Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20. This was followed by incubation with the secondary antibody (1:250,000). For HSF1 and HSF2, goat anti-rat IgG and for HSF4 goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used (Pierce Biotechnology). The blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 as above, incubated for 5 min with the substrate, and exposed to x-ray film. Many of the antisera used showed nonspecific binding with crystallins, present in very high concentrations in the lens extracts. These are not shown in the immunoblots; in most cases, the gels were run longer to exclude them from immunoblotting. RNA Extraction, RT-PCR, and Real-time PCR—Rat tissues (200–300 mg) were homogenized using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and RNA was isolated by following the manufacturer's protocol. The quality of the RNA was checked on 0.8% E-gel (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed using the RT-PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems) using random hexamer primers. In general, 1 μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed in a 20-μl reaction followed by PCR in a 50-μl reaction containing 2.5 μl of the reverse transcription reaction (RT) mix, 0.2 μm concentrations of each primer, 1.5 units of platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in the reverse transcription buffer. Optimal concentrations of MgCl2 used in each of these reactions were determined for each primer set. The real time PCRs were performed using Finnzymes-DyNamo SYBR green qPCR kit and Opticon 2 (MJ Research, Boston, MA) in a 20-μl reaction containing 1 μl of the RT mix, 0.25 μm concentrations of primer, and 10 μl of the 2× qPCR reaction mix. The annealing temperature for the experimental samples was set at 58 °C; for β-actin reactions, it was set at 55 °C. The fluorescence was measured at 80 °C. The melting curve analyses were performed at the end of the reaction (after 40 cycles) between 50 °C and 90 °C to assess the quality of the final PCR products. The threshold cycles, C(t) values were calculated by fixing the basal fluorescence at 0.05 units. Five replicate reactions were performed for each sample and the average C(t) was calculated. ΔC(t) values were calculated as C(t) sample – C(t) β-actin. The N-fold increase or decrease in expression was calculated by ΔΔC(t) method with the fetal C(t) value as the reference point. N-fold difference was determined as 2 –(ΔC(t) sample – ΔC(t) fetal) (16Zhao W.L. Daneshpouy M.E. Mounier N. Briere J. Leboeuf C. Plassa L.F. Turpin E. Cayuela J.M. Ameisen J.C. Gisselbrecht C. Janin A. Blood. 2004; 103: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Gel mobility shift assays were performed as described previously (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts (∼20–30 μg of protein) and approximately 20–30 fmol of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides (double-stranded) were used in a typical assay. The reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 15 min. For super-shift assays, 1 μl of the antisera (anti-HSF1, anti-HSF2, or anti-HSF4) was added at the end to the reaction, and incubation continued for another 15 min at the same temperature. The entire volume of the reaction was electrophoresed on 8% acrylamide gel in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 40 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. The gels were run at 150 V for ∼180 min, longer than usual, to facilitate the entry of the super-shifted complex into the gel matrix. Under these conditions, no free (unbound) probe is retained in the gel. Complexes were detected by autoradiography. HSF1 and HSF2 Are Mostly Expressed in the Fetal Lens— Fig. 1 shows that HSF 1 and HSF2 are predominantly expressed in the fetal lens in the rat. The RT-PCR gel analyses (Fig. 1a) show a gradual decrease in the level of HSF1 as well as HSF2 RNA transcripts from the fetal to postnatal stages. The real-time PCR (Fig. 1b) shows a large dramatic decrease from fetal to PN day 20 in the content of these transcripts. Whereas HSF1 shows a 25-fold decrease in transcripts, the change in HSF2 transcripts is even larger, a 175-fold decrease over the same period (Fig. 2b). The data in the Fig. 1b are complemented by the immunoblotting data (Fig. 1c). Although it is difficult to be quantitative on these immunoblots, between the fetal and the PN day 3 stages, a significant decrease in seen in both HSF 1 and HSF2 protein levels. Beyond the PN day 3, neither of these proteins can be detected at appreciable levels (Fig. 1c).Fig. 2HSF4 is predominantly expressed in the postnatal rat lens. a, RT-PCR analyses of HSF4 in the rat at different ages. Total lens RNAs was used. The arrow indicates the PCR product. b, real-time PCR analyses as in Fig. 1. c, immunoblot analyses of lens nuclear extracts using anti HSF4 (total) and anti HSF4b antibodies. The numbers 62 and 49 indicate the molecular mass (KD) markers. Note that the size of the reactive band (arrows) in the two blots is identical. In these immunoblots, only nuclear extracts were used because HSF4 is constitutively trimeric and present in the nucleus, as opposed to HSF1 and HSF2, which are also cytoplasmic (4Pirkkala L. Nykanen P. Sistonen L. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1118-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). F, fetal; lanes marked 3, 5, 10, and 20 refer to age in postnatal days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) HSF4 Is the Predominant HSF of the Postnatal Lens—The pattern of HSF1 and HSF2 presence stands in stark contrast to that seen with HSF4 (Fig. 2). The RT-PCR gel analyses (Fig. 2a) suggests only a gradual increase in the intensity of the stained HSF4 band from the fetal to postnatal stages; however, the data obtained with real-time PCR (Fig. 2b) indicate that there is a substantial (about 25-fold) increase in HSF4 transcripts from the fetal stage to PN day 10. Again, this observation is complemented by the immunoblotting data presented in Fig. 2c, which was done using two different polyclonal antibodies specific for two different isoforms of HSF4. These two isoforms (HSF4a and HSF4b) are produced by alternative splicing involving exons 8 and 9 of the HSF4 gene (17Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). HSF4b is known to constitutively bind to DNA and activate transcription. HSF4a, on the other hand, has been suggested to repress transcription (17Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 18Frejtag W. Zhang Y. Dai R. Anderson M.G. Mivechi N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14685-14694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In the data presented in Fig. 2c, there is very little difference in the mobility of the HSF4 protein band detected by anti HSF4 (total) (an antibody that will detect all HSF4 polypeptides that contain an unaltered C terminus) and the mobility of the protein detected by HSF4b-specific antibody, suggesting that the predominant reactive band on these immunoblots represents HSF4b (Fig. 2c). HSF4a is of smaller molecular mass and is made in very low amounts (17Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and is thus undetectable in these immunoblots. Presence of HSF4 in the Human Lens Extracts—The data presented in Fig. 2 clearly establish that HSF4 expression is minimal in the fetal lens and predominant in the postnatal lens. Because of the reported association between HSF4 mutations and juvenile cataractogenesis (19Bu L. Jin Y. Shi Y. Chu R. Ban A. Eiberg H. Andres L. Jiang H. Zheng G. Qian M. Cui B. Xia Y. Liu J. Hu L. Zhao G. Hayden M.R. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), we sought to examine the status of HSF4 in the human lens (Fig. 3). Although these data are derived from experiments done with single lens extracts for each age, the pattern of postnatal expression of HSF4 seems to be more or less recapitulated in the human lens. HSF1 is seen mostly in the fetal lens extracts (Fig. 3a), whereas HSF4 detectability is retained even in lens extracts made from older human lenses (62 years was the oldest lens examined; Fig. 3b). HSF4 Is Maximally Expressed in the Ocular Lens—Considering that HSF4 is the predominant HSF in the postnatal lens, it was of interest to assess the distribution of HSF4 in different tissues in the rat. The data presented in Fig. 4 demonstrate that among the tissues examined in the PN day 10 rat, the ocular lens shows the highest expression of HSF4, both at the RNA (Fig. 4a) and protein (Fig. 4b) levels. Although appreciable amounts of RNA transcripts are found in the lung, muscle, and small intestines (Fig. 4a), very little protein was seen in these tissues (Fig. 4b). HSF4, Not HSF1 or HSF2, Interacts with HSE-αB—The pattern of maximal postnatal expression of HSF4 around PN day 10–15 (Fig. 2c) is temporally consistent with the high expression of the αB-crystallin gene in the rat lens at around PN day 10 (there is a 10-fold difference in the number of αB-crystallin transcripts between the fetal and the PN day 10 stages 2M. Sapru, J. Horowitz, D. Bok, and S. Bhat, unpublished observations. and the appearance of the HSE-αB/HSF trimeric complex (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). But this only provides circumstantial evidence that the HSF in the HSE-αB/HSF complex is probably HSF4. We identified the HSF in the HSE-αB/HSF complex by super-shift analyses using specific antibodies such as anti-HSF1, anti-HSF2, and anti-HSF4, the same antibodies that were used for immunoblotting in Figs. 1 and 2. In these experiments, we used nuclear extracts rather than whole-cell extracts, as was done previously (13Somasundaram T. Bhat S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17154-17159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In so doing, we can detect trimetric complexes between [32P]HSE-αB and the HSFs even in the fetal lens extracts, albeit at very low levels (see Fig. 5a, complex III). Fig. 5a shows that even when there is very little trimeric complex (Fig. 5a, control lane), only anti-HSF4 results in the super-shift of the complex III. Fig. 5b shows that data obtained from experiments in which PN day 10 lens nuclear extracts were used. In these experiments, no HSF1- or HSF2-related activity was detected in the trimeric complexes as ascertained by lack of super-shifted complexes. Super-shift was seen only when an anti-HSF4 antibody was used (Fig. 5b). HSF4 Interacts with HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82—The experiments done with HSE-αB (Fig. 5) were repeated with heat shock promoter sequences derived from rat Hsp70 (20Mestril R. Chi S.H. Sayen M.R. Dillmann W.H. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and D. melanogaster Hsp82 (21Zimarino V. Tsai C. Wu C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 752-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Fig. 6, A and B, show that in the PN day 10 nuclear extracts, complexes obtained with [32P]HSE-Hsp70 and [32P]HSE-Hsp82 only contained HSF4, as indicated by super-shift with anti-HSF4 (Fig. 6, A and B). In the fetal lens nuclear extracts, again it is anti-HSF4 that produces a prominent super-shift (in both HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82 assays) (Fig. 6, C and D). It must be noted that in the fetal lens nuclear extracts, super-shifted complexes, although much weaker in intensity, were also obtained with anti-HSF1 (Fig. 6, C and D). It was not clear from these experiments with fetal lens nuclear extracts whether anti-HSF2 produced any super-shifted complexes. Comparative Binding Profiles of HSF4 with Three Different HSEs—The data in Fig. 6 indicated that the HSF4 in PN day 10 lens nuclear extracts binds with the HSEs in the αB-crystallin promoter, Hsp70 promoter, and Hsp82 promoter. It was of interest to assess whether HSF4 bound to all the HSE sequences with similar or differential efficiencies. The data presented in Fig. 7 show a plot of the relative binding of HSF4 to [32P]HSE-αB, [32P]HSE-Hsp70, and [32P]HSE-Hsp82 as a function of the concentration of the protein in the nuclear extracts made from PN day 10 lens. Although it seems that the binding efficiency is much higher with HSE-Hsp70, the binding of HSE-αB sequence stands out in that it gets saturated very early at lower concentrations; the binding of HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82 does not show saturation at lower concentrations. The novel binding characteristics of HSE-αB clearly stand out, particularly the early saturation and inhibition at higher concentrations. This distinct pattern of interaction between HSF4 and HSE-αB compared with HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82 is further supported by the data obtained in competition studies (Fig. 8). These assays show that the binding of [32P]HSE-Hsp70 to HSF4 is equally well competed with by its homologous competitor, HSE-Hsp70, as well as by HSE-Hsp82, but not as efficiently by HSE-αB (Fig. 8).Fig. 8Competition of [32P]HSE-Hsp70 binding to HSF4 by unlabeled HSE-αB and HSE-Hsp82. Gel shift assays using PN day 10 nuclear extracts (∼20 μg of proteins) were performed as above. The intensities of the bound complexes were measured as in Fig. 7 and plotted against the concentration of the unlabeled competitors. Molar excess amounts of unlabeled competitors used were 1, 5, 10, and 50 and added simultaneously with the labeled probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) This investigation reports on the exclusive expression of HSF4 in the postnatal ocular lens and its specific interaction with the heat shock promoter of the αB-crystallin gene. Using real-time PCR, immunoblotting, and gel mobility shift assays coupled with the use of specific antibodies, we showed that there are no HSF1 and HSF2 binding activities in the postnatal ocular lens. The data presented in this article support two important observations: 1) all tissues do not contain all the HSFs and tissues such as the postnatal ocular lens express only one, HSF4, and 2) heat shock promoters, although canonical, show differential binding to HSF4. The observation of the singular presence of HSF4 in the postnatal ocular lens affects a number of perceptions about the stress response and its universality. Our data point to a developmental stage- and tissue-specific response to stress based on the differential presence or absence of specific heat shock factor(s) and their specific interactions with heat shock promoters. This is well exemplified by the situation in the ocular lens, wherein the small heat shock protein αB-crystallin gene is highly expressed (22Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The heat shock promoter of the αB-crystallin gene has been shown to respond to heat and chemical stress in cells in culture (23Sadamitsu C. Nagano T. Fukumaki Y. Iwaki A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 24Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R.H. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 25Head M.W. Hurwitz L. Goldman J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar). However, in experiments in which the intact rat lens, in organ culture, was exposed to heat stress, no induction of the αB-crystallin gene was observed (26de Jong W.W. Hoekman W.A. Mulders J.W. Bloemendal H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Considering that the response of the HSF4 to stress activation is poorer compared with that seen with HSF1 (17Tanabe M. Sasai N. Nagata K. Liu X.D. Liu P.C. Thiele D.J. Nakai A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27845-27856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the present data (indicating HSF4 as the predominant HSF of the postnatal ocular lens), may explain why lenses, when exposed to heat stress, do not show appreciable change (induction) in the concentration of αB-crystallin (26de Jong W.W. Hoekman W.A. Mulders J.W. Bloemendal H. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Collier N.C. Schlesinger M.J. Exp. Eye Res. 1986; 43: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Three important corollaries follow from the observation of the inverse relationship of the expression of HSF1/2 and HSF4 in fetal and postnatal stages, respectively (Figs. 1, 2, 3). One, the simultaneous presence of HSF1 as well as HSF2 in the fetal stages may compensate for the absence of either one of these HSFs during early developmental stages. This may be the reason why no ocular lens abnormalities have been reported in mice null for HSF1 or HSF2 (28Kallio M. Chang Y. Manuel M. Alastalo T.P. Rallu M. Gitton Y. Pirkkala L. Loones M.T.

Benjamin I.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8005-8014Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Considering that in the fetal nuclear extracts there is almost non-existent or very weak binding of HSF1 or HSF2 to various HSEs (Figs. 5 and 6), it is also possible that these transcription factors may be inactive at this stage. Second, mutations in HSF4 have been recently reported to be associated with the most prevalent form of early childhood cataracts (lamellar cataracts) (19Bu L. Jin Y. Shi Y. Chu R. Ban A. Eiberg H. Andres L. Jiang H. Zheng G. Qian M. Cui B. Xia Y. Liu J. Hu L. Zhao G. Hayden M.R. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The almost exclusive expression of HSF4 in the postnatal ocular lens reported here corresponds remarkably to the timing of the appearance of this disease phenotype (juvenile cataractogenesis). Coupled with the demonstration that HSF4 and not HSF1 can be detected in the adult human lens extracts (Fig. 4), these data also provide a molecular basis for the association of late-onset cataract, such as Marner's cataract, with a mutation in the HSF4 DNA binding domain (19Bu L. Jin Y. Shi Y. Chu R. Ban A. Eiberg H. Andres L. Jiang H. Zheng G. Qian M. Cui B. Xia Y. Liu J. Hu L. Zhao G. Hayden M.R. Kong X. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 276-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). How these mutations alter HSF4 DNA binding abilities remains to be investigated. Third, a knockout of the HSF4 gene would have no repercussions on the development of the lens but might have severe physiological consequences to the postnatal lens. The data presented in Fig. 5 lead to the conclusion that αB-crystallin is downstream of HSF4. We already know that mutations in αB-crystallin lead to cataractogenesis in the human lens (31Berry V. Francis P. Reddy M.A. Collyer D. Vithana E. MacKay I. Dawson G. Carey A.H. Moore A. Bhattacharya S.S. Quinlan R.A. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 1141-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). αB-crystallin has chaperone-like activities (22Bhat S.P. Prog. Drug Res. 2003; 60: 205-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 32Horwitz J. Exp. Eye Res. 2003; 76: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Thus, a malfunctioning HSF4 could result in the lack of appropriate concentrations of the αB-crystallin gene product, which could impair important physiological activities. Depending on the expression of HSF4 gene, this could have both temporal and spatial consequences in the generation and maintenance of the transparent phenotype of the ocular lens, as seen in the lamellar and Marner's cataracts. In addition to αB-crystallin, HSF4 may activate a number of genes in the postnatal and the adult lens, as suggested by the presence of HSF4 in the adult human lens extracts (Fig. 4; see also Figs. 6 and 7). The observation that the heat shock element of the αB-crystallin heat shock promoter selectively binds to HSF4 (Fig. 5) suggests that different HSFs may activate different down-stream targets, leading to differential gene activity. HSF1 and HSF2 have been recently reported to activate various heat shock genes differentially (33Trinklein N.D. Chen W.C. Kingston R.E. Myers R.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2004; 9: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Differential binding of HSFs to HSEs in vitro has been reported (34Manuel M. Rallu M. Loones M.T. Zimarino V. Mezger V. Morange M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 2527-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 35Kroeger P.E. Sarge K.D. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3370-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The data presented in Figs. 5 and 6 demonstrate that there are no HSF1 or HSF2 binding activities in the PN day 10 lens nuclear extracts. This presents a unique in vivo system that contains only one HSF, HSF4. The binding profiles of HSF4 to various HSEs are presented in Fig. 7. Although binding with HSE-Hsp70 seems more efficient (Fig. 7), it is very similar to binding by HSE-Hsp82 in its initial pattern. Both HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82 show sustained binding for HSF4 over a long range of protein concentrations. On the other hand, the interaction with HSE-αB seems very different; saturation of the binding is reached at much lower protein concentrations. The fact that the binding of HSF4 with HSE-αB is inhibited at higher concentrations (compare binding with HSE-Hsp70 and HSE-Hsp82; see also inset, Fig. 7) may suggest the presence of a sequence-specific inhibitor in the lens nuclear extracts, but that remains a speculation at this time. The uniqueness of the binding of HSE-αB to HSF4 in the day 10 nuclear extracts is further supported by the competition experiment indicating that HSE-αB is not an efficient competitor for HSE-Hsp70 (Fig. 8). A clear insight into the significance of these binding profiles must await characterization of the expression profiles of HSP70 in the ocular lens. The data presented in this manuscript indicate that differential activation of downstream genes (e.g. αB-crystallin) may be brought about both by the timing of the expression of the HSFs and the specificity of the promoter-HSF interactions. Further studies will illuminate whether the specific patterns of binding affinity (Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8), at various developmental stages are sequence dictated (genetic) or epigenetic, involving protein modifications (36Hashikawa N.

https://openalex.org/W2003358724,"Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by craniosynostosis and bony syndactyly associated with point mutations (S252W and P253R) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 2 that cause FGFR2 activation. Here we investigated the role of the S252W mutation of FGFR2 on osteoblastic differentiation. Osteoblastic cells derived from digital bone in two Apert patients with the S252W mutation showed more prominent alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin and osteopontin mRNA expression, and mineralized nodule formation compared with the control osteoblastic cells derived from two independent non-syndromic polydactyly patients. Stable clones of the human MG63 osteosarcoma cells (MG63-Ap and MG63-IIIc) overexpressing a splice variant form of FGFR2 with or without the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W and FGFR2IIIc) showed a higher RUNX2 mRNA expression than parental MG63 cells. Furthermore MG63-Ap exhibited a higher osteopontin mRNA expression than did MG63-IIIc. The enhanced osteoblastic marker gene expression and mineralized nodule formation of the MG63-Ap was inhibited by the conditioned medium from the COS-1 cells overexpressing the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W. Furthermore the FGF2-induced osteogenic response in the mouse calvarial organ culture system was blocked by the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W. These results show that the S252W mutation in the FGFR2 gene enhances the osteoblast phenotype in human osteoblasts and that a soluble FGFR2 with the S252W mutation controls osteoblast differentiation induced by the S252W mutation through a dominant negative effect on FGFR2 signaling in Apert syndrome.

Apert syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited syndrome characterized by craniosynostosis, which results in skull deformity, and symmetric bony syndactyly of the hands and feet. Its prevalence is ∼15.5/1,000,000 newborns (1Cohen Jr., M.M. Kreiborg S. Lammer E.J. Cordero J.F. Mastroiacovo P. Erickson J.D. Roeper P. Martinez-Frias M.L. Am. J. Med.

With rare exceptions, Apert syndrome is caused by one of the two missense mutations of the FGFR2 gene involving an amino acid substitution, S252W or P253R, in the linker region between the second and third extracellular Ig domains (4Wilkie A.O.

S252W results from a C755G missense mutation and is more common than P253R caused by C758G in Apert patients (11Park W.J. Theda C. Maestri N.E. Meyers G.A. Fryburg J.S. Dufresne C. Cohen Jr., M.M.

Most of the Apert patients are sporadic cases and are exclusively affected by mutations arising in the paternal germ line (14Moloney D.M. Slaney S.F. Oldridge M. Wall S.A. Sahlin P. Stenman G. Wilkie A.O. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Apert mutation in the FGFR2 gene serves as a gain-of-function mutation by decreasing the dissociation rate of FGFs from FGFR2 (15Anderson J. Burns H.D. Enriquez-Harris P. Wilkie A.O. Heath J.K. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1475-1483Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 16Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Yu K. Ornitz D.M. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition to the retained ligand dependence for the receptor activation, the loss of ligand specificity of FGFR2 is also elicited by Apert mutations (16Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N.

It is postulated that FGFR2 signaling is essential for osteogenic cell differentiation and proliferation during the process of suture growth and closure because FGFR2 transcripts are expressed at the osteogenic fronts in developing calvarial bone (19Iseki S. Wilkie A.O. Morriss-Kay G.M. Development. 1999; 126: 5611-5620PubMed Google Scholar, 21Rice D.P. Aberg T. Chan Y. Tang Z. Kettunen P.J. Pakarinen L. Maxson R.E. Thesleff I. Development. 2000; 127: 1845-1855PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore calvarial osteoblastic cells derived from Apert patients are reported to exhibit a differentiated osteoblastic phenotype in accordance with the clinical symptom of the premature suture ossification in the patients (26Lomri A.

A recent study has also illustrated that the mesenchymal splice variant form of the mouse Fgfr2 (Fgfr2IIIc) acts as a positive regulator of ossification by affecting cells of osteoblastic lineage (28Eswarakumar V.P. Monsonego-Ornan E. Pines M. Antonopoulou I. Morriss-Kay G.M. Lonai P. Development. 2002; 129: 3783-3793PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that the Apert mutation of FGFR2 may stimulate differentiation and/or proliferation in mouse or human cells, although the precise mechanisms are still not completely understood. More specifically, the biological phenotypes of the digit bone cells derived from Apert syndrome patients are totally unknown. We have recently reported an abnormal rapid mineralization of the callus during distraction osteogenesis of the deformed thumb in an Apert syndrome patient (29Matsumoto K. Nakanishi H. Koizumi Y. Seike T. Tanimoto Y. Yokozeki M. Hiura K. Moriyama K. Minami M. Urano Y. Hirabayashi S. Scand. J. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. Hand Surg. 2003; 36: 368-372Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Consistent with the previous genetic and biochemical studies (26Lomri A. Lemonnier J. Hott M. de Parseval N. Lajeunie E. Munnich A. Renier D. Marie P.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1998; 101: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fragale A. Tartaglia M. Bernardini S. Di Stasi A.M. Di Rocco C. Velardi F. Teti A. Battaglia P.A. Migliaccio S. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 154: 1465-1477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), these clinical findings have raised a possibility that the S252W mutation of the FGFR2 may directly cause the unusual differentiation of the digital bone cells. Here we demonstrate that transfection of the gene for human FGFR2IIIc with the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W) inhibits the proliferation and reciprocally enhances osteoblastic differentiation of the MG63 human osteosarcoma cell line in vitro. Furthermore the soluble FGFR2IIIcS252W lacking transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains inhibits the osteoblastic phenotype of MG63 cells overexpressing FGFR2IIIcS252W. These results provide direct evidence that activation of FGFR2IIIc caused by the S252W mutation promotes osteoblast phenotype and that a soluble form of FGFR2 with S252W mutation controls osteoblast differentiation. Patients—All the sampling procedures were undertaken on the basis of informed consent obtained from the patients and parents and were approved by the Ethical Committee of the Tokushima University Medical Hospital. Patients 1 and 2 were male Apert syndrome patients with the germ line mutation of S252W in the FGFR2 gene. Bone samples were obtained during the distraction osteogenesis of the phalanges of the thumbs at 6 years of age in Patient 1 and at 7 years of age in Patient 2. Patients 3 and 4 were male and female patients with no major congenital anomalies except for polydactyly. Bone samples were obtained during distraction osteogenesis for the deformed thumbs at 6 years of age in Patient 3 and at 4 years of age in Patient 4. The detailed information about these patients is described in our previous report (29Matsumoto K. Nakanishi H. Koizumi Y. Seike T. Tanimoto Y. Yokozeki M. Hiura K. Moriyama K. Minami M. Urano Y. Hirabayashi S. Scand. J. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. Hand Surg. 2003; 36: 368-372Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Isolation of Osteoblastic Cells from Bone Samples of the Patients— Osteoblastic cells were isolated from the digit bone samples of Patients 1–4 by collagenase digestion. The samples were minced into small pieces, washed with PBS (pH 7.3) to remove the bone marrow cells, and treated with HEPES buffer containing 1% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), 25 mm HEPES (Wako), 10 mm NaHCO3, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 30 mm KCl, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5 mg/ml glucose, and 7.5 mmNα-p-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C with shaking. After incubation, the supernatant was transferred into a new tube and centrifuged at 1,200 rpm for 10 min. These procedures were repeated six times, and these pellets were gently resuspended in α-minimum essential medium (α-MEM, Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Sigma) and antibiotics (100 IU/ml penicillin and 100 IU/ml streptomycin, Invitrogen). The fractionated osteoblastic cells (F1–6) obtained by the collagenase digestion of the bone samples were seeded into a culture dish and maintained in α-MEM with 10% FBS and antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The medium was changed every 3 days, and the cells were subcultured using 1% trypsin, EDTA solution (0.05% trypsin and 0.53 mm EDTA, Sigma) when they reached confluency. The cells from the second passage were used for the reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analysis, and the cells between the sixth and eighth passages were used for the other experiments. The cells obtained from Patients 1, 2, 3, and 4 were named ApOB1, ApOB2, HOB1, and HOB2, respectively. RT-PCR and Restriction Enzyme Digestion Analysis—The total RNA was extracted from the cells using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microgram of total RNA was reverse-transcribed with an RNA PCR kit (Takara Biomedicals, Shiga, Japan), and PCR was performed for 25–30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at each temperature for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min using the oligonucleotide primers described in Table I. The amplified products were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. To detect the expression of mutant FGFR2 mRNA, the PCR products were digested with MboI (Takara) at 37 °C for 1 h, and the DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 3% agarose gel.Table IOligonucleotide primers used in RT-PCRGene sequence mRNAOligonucleotide sequenceProduct sizeTmbp°CHuman FGFR-25′-CGCATTGGAGGCTACAAGGTA-3′429585′-ACCCGCCAAGCACGTATATTC-3′Human osteocalcin5′-CTCACACTCCTCGCCCTATT-3′241555′-GGTCAGCCAACTCGTCACAG-3′Human osteopontin5′-CAAGTAAGTCCAACGAAAGC-3′511555′-AATCTGGACTGCTTGTGG-3′Human RUNX25′-CCCCACGACAACCGCACCAT-3′289555′-CACTCCGGCCCACAAATCCTC-3′Human GAPDH5′-TCTGCCCCCTCTGCTGATGC-3′613585′-CCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTTAG-3′ Open table in a new tab ALP Assay—The cells were cultured in α-MEM with 10% FBS, and the cultures were washed with PBS twice after bringing them to confluency, scraped with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.7), and sonicated for 20 s. After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, ALP activity in the collected supernatant was determined with substrate incubation buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mmp-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma), 20 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 m 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanediol (pH 10.3) (Wako). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.2 volume of 1 n NaOH. The hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate was monitored at A405 nm using a multiwell spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). p-Nitrophenol was used as the standard. The protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). The enzyme activity was determined by the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and expressed as units/mg of protein (units = nmol of p-nitro-phenol formation/incubation min). Matrix Mineralization—After the cells became confluent, the medium was supplied with the mineralization medium containing 10% FBS, 1 × 10–8m dexamethasone (Sigma), 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma) in the case of ApOBs and HOBs, and the diluted mineralization medium containing 10% FBS, 1 × 10–10m dexamethasone, 100 μm β-glycerophosphate, 500 μg/ml ascorbic acid in the case of MG63 cells. The medium was changed every 3 days. The mineralized matrix was stained by alizarin red-S (AR-S, pH 4.2, Wako). Briefly, at each time point, the cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 70% ethanol for 60 min. The fixed cells were incubated with 40 mm AR-S for 10 min with shaking. To minimize any nonspecific staining, the cells were rinsed five times with deionized water and once with PBS for 20 min. The AR-S staining of the mineralization of the extra cellular matrix was photographed. Construction of FGFR2IIIc and Soluble FGFR2IIIc Expression Vectors—RT-PCR amplification of FGFR2IIIc and FGFR2IIIcS252W was carried out with a specific oligonucleotide primer pair that contained the start or stop codon of FGFR2 (5′-ATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGTTTCATCT-3′ for upstream, 5′-TCATGTTTTAACACTGCCGTTTATAG-3′ for downstream). The reverse transcribed total RNA prepared from ApOB1 was added to the PCR as the template. PCR was performed for 40 cycles of penetration at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 30 s, elongation at 72 °C for 3 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The amplified products were then ligated into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using T4 DNA ligase, and each isolated plasmid cDNA was sequenced in both 5′ and 3′ orientations by the FGFR2-specific primers or vector-specific primers. To remove the stop codon of FGFR2 or gain the soluble FGFR2 lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, the plasmid cDNA for FGFR2 with or without the S252W mutation was amplified by PCR with the specific primer pairs containing the start codon but not the stop codon of FGFR2 and the XbaI/BamHI site (5′-GCTCTAGAATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGT-3′ for upstream, 5′-CGGGATCCAAGCTGTAATCTCCTTTT-3′ for downstream) or amplifying the extracellular domain of FGFR2 and with the XbaI/BamHI site (5′-CGTCTAGAATGGTCAGCTGGGGTCGT-3′ for upstream, 5′-CGGGATCCGGAAGCTGTAATCTCCTTTT-3′ for downstream). The amplified products were digested with XbaI/BamHI and were subcloned into the 3xFLAG CMV13 expression vector (Sigma) by the XbaI/BamHI site in the frame. The sequence of each expression vector was confirmed by sequencing in both the 5′ and 3′ orientations by FGFR2-specific primers or vector-specific primers, and these expression vectors were used as constructs encoding the full-length FGFR2IIIc with or without the S252W mutation (FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG or FGFR2IIIc-FLAG) and soluble FGFR2IIIc with or without the S252W mutation (sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG or sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG). Transient and Stable Transfection—COS-1 cells for the transient transfection and MG63 cells for the stable transfection were used in this study. These cells were kind gift from the Institute of Development, Aging, and Cancer, Tohoku University, Japan and maintained with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS. For the transient transfection, 1 × 104 COS-1 cells were grown in a 100-mm culture dish at a density of 80% confluence and were transfected with 10 μg of expression vectors using SuperFect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The COS-1 cells transfected with the FGFR2IIIc-FLAG or FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG expression vectors and the culture medium from COS-1 cells transfected with the sFGFR2IIIc-FLAG or sFGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG expression vectors (IIIc-CM or Ap-CM) were used for further analyses. For the stable transfection, MG63 cells were grown in 100-mm culture dishes at a density of 80% confluence and were transfected with 10 μg of FGFR2IIIc-FLAG or FGFR2IIIcS252W-FLAG using SuperFect (Qiagen). After 24 h of transfection, the cells were trypsinized, plated on 100-mm culture dishes, and maintained with α-MEM containing 10% FBS and 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin, Sigma) for 2 weeks. The resulting colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders and transferred to 96-well plates. The generated clones were used for further analyses. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nakarai Chemicals, Ltd., Kyoto, Japan), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate (Wako)) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein extract was immunoprecipitated with the antiphosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) overnight at 4 °C and incubated with 60 μl of protein A-agarose (Oncogene Research Products, Boston, MA) for 2 h. The protein A-antibody-antigen complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer, and 100 μl of the sample buffer (4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, Sigma) was added and boiled, and the supernatant was used for Western blotting. Forty micrograms of the cell extract and 30 μl of the culture medium were mixed with the sample buffer, boiled, and also subjected to Western blotting. These samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad), and incubated with the anti-FGFR2 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology), or the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma). Proteins were visualized by an ECL plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The radiographic film was recorded by image scanner (EPSON, Tokyo, Japan), and the density of the bands was quantified using the image analyzing computer software NIH Image. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Bromide Assay—The rate of cell growth was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Initially 5 × 103 cells were subcultured in a 96-well plate and then cultured for 24 h to allow the cells to adhere to the plate. After preincubation, the culture medium was changed to a serum-free medium and incubated for 24 h in the presence of either IIIc-CM or Ap-CM with FGF2 (20 ng/ml). After the indicated culture period, 10 μl of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution (5 mg/ml, diluted with PBS pH 7.6) was added to each well followed by 4 h of incubation at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 100 μl of acid-isopropanol solution (0.78 mg/ml isopropanol and 0.04 n HCl) to each well. The plates were allowed to stand overnight at room temperature to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance of the samples was read at 570 nm in reference to 630 nm with a multiwell spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Immunocytochemistry—The cells were plated on a glass bottom chamber and grown to 80% confluence. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h, rinsed with PBS, and treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The cells were then treated with 10% rabbit serum to block nonspecific binding and incubated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG. After washing with PBS, the cells were observed using the confocal laser microscope (Radiance 2000, Bio-Rad). 5-Bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdUrd) Incorporation—S phase cells were detected using an in situ cell proliferation kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly the cells were grown on the glass bottom chamber for confocal laser microscopic observation or on the 100-mm culture dishes for FACS analysis up to 80% confluence. The cells were then incubated in the presence of 10 μm BrdUrd labeling reagent to facilitate the incorporation of BrdUrd into DNA in place of thymidine. For the confocal laser microscopic observations, the cells were fixed in 70% ethanol diluted in glycine buffer (50 mm glycine, pH 2.0) for 45 min at room temperature and incubated in 4 m HCl for 20 min at room temperature for DNA denaturation. For immunodetection of the incorporated BrdUrd, the cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibodies for 45 min at 37 °C. After the administration of 1 μg/ml propidium iodide, the cells were observed by confocal microscopy (Bio-Rad). For the FACS analysis, the cells were detached by trypsin/EDTA treatment after the incorporation of BrdUrd. After the DNA denaturation, immune reaction and propidium iodide staining, the cells were analyzed by a flow cytometer (EPICS, Coulter, Miami, FL). Mouse Calvarial Organ Culture—The isolation and culture of the mouse calvarial explants were performed by a method described previously (30Gong Y. Slee R.B. Fukai N. Rawadi G. Roman-Roman S.

After removing the skin and brain, all the calvariae were placed upside down on a bed of 1.0% Seakem GTG agarose gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications, Rockland, ME) in a 24-well culture dish (Iwaki, Tokyo, Japan). A thin layer of 1% agarose gel covered the calvarial explants. The agarose was dissolved in α-MEM containing 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml ascorbic acid (Sigma), 5 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma), and antibiotics. The conditioned media were changed every 2 days. The cultured tissues were harvested on day 7, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 6-μm sections. Hematoxylin-eosin staining was performed, and the tissues were photographed. Statistical Analysis—Data are expressed as means ± S.D. A statistical analysis was performed using the Student's t test for ALP assay or using the posthoc test for proliferation assay. All the data were reproduced in triplicate at least three times. The p values of less than 0.05 or 0.01 were considered to be significantly different in the Student's t test or the posthoc test, respectively. The ApOBs Show Highly Differentiated Osteoblastic Phenotype in Vitro—We previously reported a C934G point mutation that elicited an amino acid substitution, S252W, of the FGFR2 gene in Patients 1 and 2 by direct DNA sequence analysis of the genomic DNA prepared from peripheral blood (31Matsumoto K. Urano Y. Kubo Y. Nakanishi H. Arase S. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1998; 101: 307-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first performed RT-PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion analysis using fraction 3 (F3) of ApOBs isolated from the two Apert syndrome patients to confirm evidence of the mutant FGFR2IIIc gene expression. The RT-PCR was carried out with the specific primers for FGFR2, and the 429-bp size-matched amplified products for FGFR2 were visualized in all samples (Table I and Fig. 1A, upper panel). We could not detect the gene expression of FGFR2IIIb splice variant form by RT-PCR using the specific primer pair. Hence it was indicated that mRNA for"

One key step of nucleotide excision repair that is poorly understood is the transfer of damaged DNA from UvrA to UvrB, prior to incision by UvrC. To study this transfer, we have utilized two types of arylazido-modified photoaffinity reagents that probe residues in the Uvr proteins that are closest to either the damaged or non-damaged strands. The damaged strand probes consisted of dNTP analogs linked to a terminal arylazido moiety. These analogs were incorporated into double-stranded DNA using DNA polymerase β and functioned as both the damage site and the cross-linking reagent. The non-damaged strand probe contained an arylazido moiety coupled to a phosphorothioate-modified backbone of an oligonucleotide opposite the damaged strand, which contained an internal fluorescein adduct. Six site-directed mutants of Bacillus caldotenax UvrB located in different domains within the protein (Y96A, E99A, R123A, R183E, F249A, and D510A), and two domain deletions (Δ2 and Δβ-hairpin), were assayed. Data gleaned from these mutants suggest that the handoff of damaged DNA from UvrA to UvrB proceeds in a three-step process: 1) UvrA and UvrB bind to the damaged site, with UvrA in direct contact; 2) a transfer reaction with UvrB contacting mostly the non-damaged DNA strand; 3) lesion engagement by the damage recognition pocket of UvrB with concomitant release of UvrA.

The reaction proceeds in the following order: 1) damage recognition, 2) damage verification, 3) incision 3′ to the lesion, 4) incision 5′ to the lesion, 5) DNA re-synthesis, and 6) DNA ligation (6Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current model for UvrABC protein function during the initial steps of bacterial NER is as follows. In solution, UvrA dimerizes to become UvrA2, and ATP binding by the UvrA monomers promotes dimer formation (5Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 7Mazur S. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4432-4443Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). UvrA2 interacts with UvrB to form the UvrA2B complex. Although the UvrA2 dimer possesses the ability to recognize DNA lesions by itself (6Van Houten B. Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 54: 18-51Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Grossman L. Yeung A.T. Mutat. Res. 1990; 236: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), it is believed that the UvrA2B complex is the DNA damage recognition complex of the NER machinery (9Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have proposed a padlock model for UvrB detection of DNA damage in which the β-hairpin of UvrB is key to the proper recognition and processing of the lesion (9Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 10Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C.

In this model, the UvrA2B complex binds to DNA and searches locally for DNA lesions fueled by ATP-dependent motions between domains 1a/b and the β-hairpin and domain 3 of UvrB. If no lesion is encountered, the UvrA2B complex dissociates from the DNA. If the proteins encounter a lesion, conformational changes occur such that the DNA containing the lesion, which is believed to be intimately in contact with UvrA, is passed via an unknown mechanism to UvrB (12Orren D.K. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, major conformational changes occur within the proteins as well as to the DNA (14Verhoeven E.E. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Hoeijmakers J.H. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 601-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). During this transition stage of damage verification, UvrA is believed to hydrolyze ATP and dissociate from the UvrA2B·DNA complex, or the process of UvrB engaging the lesion may in and of itself trigger the release of UvrA (15Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The padlock model predicts that UvrB binds ATP and harnesses the energy of this molecule to impose an unfavorable conformation on the DNA; the β-hairpin moiety of UvrB separates the DNA strands to facilitate incision (9Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). DNA in complex with UvrB has also been visualized as being bent and wrapped around the protein at this stage of the reaction (5Goosen N. Moolenaar G.F. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 16Shi Q. Thresher R. Sancar A. Griffith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In addition, atomic force microscopy has revealed that UvrB might function as a dimer (17Verhoeven E.E. Wyman C. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Once UvrA departs from the UvrB·DNA complex, UvrC, which has two separate catalytic sites (18Lin J.J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Verhoeven E.E. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol.

The incision mediated by the N-terminal nuclease domain of UvrC occurs 4–5 nucleotides 3′ to the lesion and precedes the incision 8 nucleotides 5′ to the site of the lesion, mediated by the C-terminal UvrC nuclease domain. This dual action creates a 12-nucleotide fragment containing the lesion (18Lin J.J. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17688-17692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Verhoeven E.E. van Kesteren M. Moolenaar G.F. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol.

Classically, protein-DNA interactions have been studied via the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Several laboratories including our own have utilized this technique to determine whether the UvrA and UvrB proteins interact in a productive manner (22Visse R. King A. Moolenaar G.F. Goosen N. van de Putte P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9881-9888Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23Van Houten B. Snowden A.

This technique can readily distinguish between UvrA2·DNA and UvrB·DNA complexes. However, heterotrimeric complexes such as UvrA2B·DNA are poorly resolved, with the exception of complexes involving the Δβ-hairpin UvrB mutant, which lacks residues 97–112 (11Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M.

In this case, a stable UvrAB·DNA complex is created, which migrates slower than the UvrA2·DNA complex. However, it is not known which protein is in direct contact with the damaged DNA in this UvrAB·DNA complex. In general with current methodologies it has been a challenge to determine where in the reaction pathway the DNA containing the lesion is transferred to UvrB. Here we describe the successful utilization of UV-activated photoreactive DNA probes containing azido groups that allow us to capture the UvrA and UvrB proteins during the NER process while they are in close proximity to these groups in dsDNA. We have taken a two-pronged approach in investigating the molecular handoff of damaged DNA from UvrA to UvrB. First, two dNTP analogs linked to terminal arylazido groups were incorporated into dsDNA using DNA polymerase β (pol β). In this manner, these reagents served as both the site of DNA damage, as well as the cross-linking reagent. In the second approach, an arylazido compound was coupled to a phosphorothioate-modified backbone of an oligonucleotide opposite the damaged strand containing an internal fluorescein adduct. Thus, by design, protein contact sites on both the damaged and non-damaged sides of the DNA were probed. We chose to examine various mutations of the UvrB protein thought to be important in the handoff procedure. Due to their varied location within the UvrB protein (see Fig. 1) as well as their phenotypes observed in the incision and EMSA assays, six site-directed mutations of Bacillus caldotenax UvrB (Y96A, E99A, R123A, R183E, F249A, and D510A) as well as two domain deletions (Δ2, which lacks amino acids Val158–Phe244, and Δβ-hairpin, which lacks 16 amino acids from Gln97 to Asp112) (15Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) were assayed via UV-activated photoaffinity cross-linking. Combined with techniques such as the EMSA and incision assays, the successful DNA-protein cross-linking technique described here helps to elucidate the role of the β-hairpin region, domain 2, and Tyr96 of UvrB in the handoff of DNA from UvrA to UvrB. Expression and Purification of UvrABC Proteins—The UvrA and UvrB proteins, as well as UvrB point mutants Y96A, E99A, R123A, R183E, F249A, D510A, and domain mutants Δ2 (lacks amino acids Val158-Phe244), and Δβ-hairpin (lacks amino acids Gln97 to Asp112) (15Truglio J.J.

UvrC was purified in a similar manner from Thermotoga maritima in C41(DE3) cells. DNA Substrates—All DNA substrates were synthesized by Sigma-Genosys (Woodlands, TX), except for the S-1 substrate, which was synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Upon receipt, oligonucleotides were resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.1 mm EDTA and stored at -20 °C. dNTP Substrates and Cross-linking Reagents—dTTP and dCTP were obtained from Roche Applied Science. 5-{[N-(4-azidotetrafluorobenzylideneaminooxy)methylcarbamoyl]-trans-3-aminopropenyl-1}-2′-deoxyuridine-5′-triphosphate (XL1, Fig. 2A) was synthesized and characterized as described previously (25Wlassoff W.A.

Synthesis of exo-N-{2-[N-(4-azido-2,5-difluoro-3-chloropyridine-6-yl)-3-aminopropionyl]aminoethyl}-2′-deoxycytidine-5′-triphosphate (XL2, Fig. 2B) will be described elsewhere. p-Azidophenacyl bromide (AZ, Fig. 2C) was purchased from Sigma. Radiolabeled DNA Duplex Notation—Throughout this paper we discuss a variety of duplex DNA substrates. For clarification purposes, we wish to point out in advance that the strand listed first in the naming of a duplexed oligonucleotide is 5′-32P-labeled (e.g. for substrate F26/ND, the F26 strand is 5′-labeled versus S-1AZ/F26 where the S-1AZ strand is 5′-labeled). Fluorescein Substrate, F26/ND—The DNA sequence of the 50-mer double-stranded substrate containing a single internal fluorescein (FldT; Fig. 3A, position in sequence indicated by red T26) adduct was: F26, (5′-GACTACGTACTGTTACGGCTCCATC[FldT]26CTACCGCAATCAGGCCAGATCTGC-3′), while the complementary non-damaged strand (ND) was 5′-GCAGATCTGGCCTGATTGCGGTAGCGATGGAGCCGTAACAGTACGTAGTC-3′. The F26 strand was 5′-end-labeled using OptiKinase (United States Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, and the enzyme was heat denatured by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C. After labeling, the free nucleotides were removed by gel filtration chromatography (Micro Biospin-6, Bio-Rad). The labeled oligonucleotide was annealed with the complementary strand (ND) using equimolar amounts. The double-stranded character of the 50-mer duplex was analyzed on a native 12% polyacrylamide gel. AZ Cross-linker Substrates, F26/S-1AZ and NDAZ/F26 —A 50-mer oligonucleotide (sequence identical to ND) was synthesized to contain a phosphorothioate modification at the phosphodiester linkage between the 25th and 26th nucleotide from the 5′-end (indicated by blue S-1, Fig. 3A). The 32P-labeled substrate was then modified to contain the azidophenacyl cross-linking moiety as described by Yang and Nash (26Yang S.W. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12183-12187Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. A stock solution of 10 mm p-azidophenacyl bromide was prepared in fresh Me2SO under reduced light conditions. The S-1 50-mer (25 μl, 36 pmol), dissolved in 40 mm sodium bicarbonate (pH 9), was mixed with 10 mm p-azidophenacyl bromide (25 μl) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Butanol (500 μl) and dH2O (100 μl) were added to the reaction mixtures. The butanol layer was removed, and the aqueous layer was extracted with an additional 2 × 500 μl of butanol. The aqueous layer was then mixed with glycogen (10 μl; 2 mg/ml), 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.5) (10% of total reaction volume), and 3 additional reaction volumes of ethanol and allowed to precipitate overnight at -20 °C. The samples were then centrifuged for 60 min at 4 °C. The pellets were washed with ice-cold 70% ethanol (1 ml) and then dried under vacuum. The azidophenacyl-modified oligonucleotide (S-1AZ) was resuspended in TE-100 (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm KCl) and annealed to the appropriate complementary oligonucleotide as described above. The ND oligonucleotide was subjected to the same procedures described above for S-1 to gauge nonspecific incorporation of the AZ modification. Gapped Heteroduplex Substrates, Gap25 and Gap26—To generate gapped heteroduplex substrates, both a 25-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GACTACGTACTGTTACGGCTCCATC-3′) and a 24-mer oligonucleotide (5′-GACTACGTACTGTTACGGCTCCAT-3′) were 5′-end-labeled with OptiKinase (United States Biochemical Corp.) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences) as described above. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 20 mm EDTA, and the enzyme was heat-denatured by incubation for 10 min at 65 °C. The entire reaction volume was then passed through a Micro Biospin 6 column (prewashed four times with 10 mm NH4OAc). The column eluent was evaporated to dryness. The 5′-labeled 25-mer was resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.1 mm EDTA and mixed at an equimolar ratio with a 5′-phosphorylated 24-mer (5′-pCTACCGCAATCAGGCCAGATCTGC-3′, the second half of the “top” strand) and a 50-mer (5′-CGTCTAGACCGGACTAACGCCATCTCTACCTCGGCATTGTCATGCATCAG-3′, “bottom” strand) by heating at 90 °C for 5 min in the presence of 100 mm KCl. The 5′-labeled 24-mer was resuspended in 1 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) and 0.1 mm EDTA and mixed at an equimolar ratio with a 5′-phophorylated 25-mer (5′-pTCTACCGCAATCAGGCCAGATCTGC-3′, the second half of the top strand) and a 50mer (5′-CGTCTAGACCGGACTAACGCCATCTCTACCTCGGCATTGTCATGCATCAG-3′, bottom strand). The respective oligonucleotide mixtures were annealed by slowly cooling to room temperature. Nicked Heteroduplex Substrates, dT26, dC25, XL126, and XL225—Nicked heteroduplex substrates were prepared by incubating the gapped heteroduplex substrates Gap26 and Gap25 (∼22 pmol) with 100 pmol of dTTP and XL1, or 400 pmol dCTP and XL2, respectively, in the presence of human pol β (45 pmol, a generous gift from Drs. Rajendra Prasad and Samuel Wilson, NIEHS, National Institutes of Health) in 13 μl of 1× pol β buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 20% glycerol) for 1 h at 37 °C. Incorporation of natural or base-substituted photoreactive dNMP (XL1, XL2) residues into the 3′-end of the DNA was analyzed on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and electrophoresis was performed at 350 V in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA buffer (TBE: 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid and 2 mm EDTA). The gels were dried and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen (Amersham Biosciences) overnight. Incorporation efficiency was calculated using the Molecular Dynamics software ImageQuant. UvrABC Incision Assay—The 5′-end-labeled duplex DNA (2 nm) was incised by the thermophillic UvrABC enzymes (20 nm B. caldotenax UvrA, 100 nm B. caldotenax UvrB, 50 nm T. maritima UvrC) in 20 μl of UvrABC incision buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) at 55 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 20 mm EDTA or via the direct addition of 10% of the reaction volume to 5 μl of formamide, followed by heating to 85 °C for 15 min and then cooling on ice. The incision products were resolved on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, and electrophoresis was performed at 350 V for 45 min in 1× TBE. The gels were processed and developed as described above. The incision efficiency was calculated using the Amersham Biosciences software ImageQuant. DNA-UvrAB Cross-linking Assay—The 5′-end-labeled duplex DNA containing the cross-linker moiety (2 nm, XL126, XL225, or S-1AZ) was incubated with the UvrAB proteins (200 nm B. caldotenax UvrA, 1000 nm B. caldotenax wild-type (WT) UvrB or mutants) in 20 μl of reaction volume containing UvrAB cross-linking buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) at 55 °C for up to 30 min in the dark. Reaction vials were immediately transferred to a platform 5 cm below a 365 nm UV lamp (UVP, Blak-Ray Longwave UV Mercury lamp, 100 watts) for indicated time points, typically 5 min). A sample of the reaction (8 μl) was then removed and incubated with 10 μl of NuPage 4× LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) containing dithiothreitol and heated for 15 min at 85 °C. The cross-linked products were resolved on a 10% NuPage Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) in 1× NuPage MOPS SDS running buffer (Invitrogen). The gels were processed and developed as described above. The percent of DNA cross-linked to protein was calculated using the Amersham Biosciences software ImageQuant. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions were performed with 2 nm duplexed DNA substrate (5′-32P-labeled F26/NDB), 25 nm B. caldotenax UvrA and 125 nm B. caldotenax WT UvrB or mutant in 20 μl of UvrABC buffer for 20 min at 55 °C. The products were resolved on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (19:1). The gel and the buffer contained 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 44.5 mm boric acid, 1.25 mm EDTA) with 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4 °C for ∼2 h (∼40 mA per gel). The gels were developed and processed as described above. The percent of DNA shifted was determined using the Amersham Biosciences software ImageQuant. Experimental Strategy—Oligonucleotides for this study (see Fig. 3A for general sequence) were designed to incorporate lesions such as fluorescein (F26) and/or photoaffinity reagents (XL1, XL2, AZ; Fig. 2) in a centrally located position (i.e. on or near base 25 or 26) of a 50-base pair fragment of dsDNA. Previous studies have shown that a centrally located lesion such as fluorescein (F26/NDB) is well recognized by the UvrABC NER system (11Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B.

Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). By placing cross-linking reagents on either the damaged or non-damaged strands of the DNA, this study aims to capture the regions of the proteins that are in closest proximity to the lesion during protein assembly for NER and assess the handoff of damaged DNA from UvrA to WT UvrB and UvrB mutants from the perspective of both the damaged site and the non-damaged strand. Photoaffinity labeling has been used to study protein-DNA interactions within a variety of biochemical systems (27Knorre D.G. Godovikova T.S.

Chem. 1992; 267: 780-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed, using a psoralen monoadduct, that UvrB forms intimate contacts with the damage site and that UvrD (helicase II) is necessary to dissociate the excised oligonucleotide from the post-incision protein-DNA complex. It was suggested that within this complex, UvrB remains bound to the non-damaged strand and was released by the action of DNA polymerase I. In a similar manner, Reardon and Sancar (31Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5938-5945Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) probed the molecular anatomy of the preincision complexes of human nucleotide excision repair proteins. Base-substituted analogs of dNTP carrying photoreactive arylazido groups (32Lavrik O.I. Khodyreva S.N. Schneider M.P. Chemical Probes in Biology: Science at the Interface of Chemistry, Biology and Medicine.

Wilson S.H. Favre A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 602-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, a variety of reactive dNTPs with photoreactive azide functional groups have been surveyed for their ability to cross-link DNA to yeast RNA polymerase in their transcription complexes (37Tate J.J. Persinger J. Bartholomew B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1421-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Phosphorothioester backbone modifications have been utilized to successfully couple an azidophenacyl moiety to oligonucleotides and cross-link proteins such as integration host factor and transcription factor IIIB to DNA (26Yang S.W. Nash H.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12183-12187Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 38Persinger J. Sengupta S.M. Bartholomew B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5218-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). By incorporating both photoreactive azide-containing dNTPs and the azidophenacyl cross-linking moieties into oligonucleotides in this study, we sought to gain new insight into the interaction of UvrA and UvrB with damaged DNA. We have included a graphic representation of our modified DNA substrates super-imposed on the crystal structure of B. caldotenax UvrB Y96A, Fig. 3E, (10Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As stated above, we have strategically designed our substrates to contain a cross-linking probe on either the damaged or non-damaged strand (XL126 and XL225 or S-1AZ/F26) of the DNA. Incorporation and Characterization of Cross-linking Reagents—Both DNA base and backbone modifications were applied in this study. Base modification required the synthesis of base-substituted dNTPs with an arylazide functional group (25Wlassoff W.A. Dobrikov M.I. Safronov I.V. Dudko R.Y. Bogachev V.S. Kandaurova V.V.

Development of this polymerized network has profound effects upon tissue architecture as well as on the intracellular organization and differentiation of neighboring cells. The laminin N-terminal (LN) domains have been shown to mediate this interaction and studies using proteolytic fragments derived from laminin-1 led to the theory that network assembly depends on the formation of a heterotrimeric complex between LN domains derived from α, β, and γ chains in different laminin molecules with homologous interactions being insignificant. The laminin family consists of 15 known isoforms formed from five α, three β, and three γ chains, of which some are truncated and lack the N-terminal LN domain. To address whether the model of heterotrimeric complex formation is applicable to laminin isoforms other than laminin-1, eight LN domains found in the laminin protein family were recombinantly expressed and tested in three different assays for homologous and heterologous interactions. The results showed that the lack of homologous interactions is an exception, with such interactions being seen for LN domains derived from all α chains and from the β and2 β3 subunits. The γ chain-derived LN domains showed a far more limited binding repertoire, particularly in the case of the γ3 chain, which is found present in a range of non-basement membrane locations. Further, whereas the interactions depended upon Ca2+ ions, with EDTA reversibly abrogating binding, EDTA-induced conformational changes were not reversible. Together these results demonstrate that the assembly model proposed on the basis of laminin-1 may be a simplification, with the assembly of naturally occurring laminin networks being far more complex and highly dependent upon which laminin isoforms are present.

Basement membranes are specialized extracellular matrices found underlying all epithelia and endothelia as well as surrounding many types of mesenchymal cells. Laminins constitute the major noncollagenous protein component within the basement membrane and are crucial for its formation (1De Arcangelis A. Neuville P. Boukamel R. Lefebvre O. Kedinger M.

Through their interactions with specific receptors, especially members of the β1 integrin family and α-dystroglycan, they induce many cellular effects, including differentiation and cellular and axonal migration. The prototype, laminin-1, isolated from embryonic carcinoma cells (3Chung A.E. Jaffe R. Freeman I.L. Vergnes J.-P. Braginski J.E. Carlin B. Cell. 1979; 16: 277-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) or the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor (4Timpl R. Rohde H. Gehron Robey P. Rennard S.I. Foidart J.-M. Martin G.R. J.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 6517-6528Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Laminins are multidomain heterotrimers formed by the combination of one α, one β, and one γ chain. Laminin-1 is an 800-kDa glycoprotein composed of a 400-kDa α1 chain and β1 and γ1 chains, each of 200 kDa. It has a cross structure with one long and three short arms, the latter being formed from the three free N-terminal ends of the α, β, and γ chains (8Engel J. Odermatt E. Engel A. Madri J.A. Furthmayr H. Rohde H. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 150: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). These parts of the β and γ chains each contain two globular domains, designated IV and VI, whereas there are three, IVa, IVb, and VI, in the short arm contributed by the α chain. The globules are interspersed by multiple laminin epidermal growth factor-like (LE) 1The abbreviations used are: LE, laminin epidermal growth factor-like; LN, laminin N-terminal; xMAP, flexible multianalyte profiling; Bicine, N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time-of-flight; BS3, bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate. domains forming rods. The VI domains are also designated laminin N-terminal (LN) domains, and this nomenclature will be used throughout. As well as being found in full-length laminin chains, LN domains are also present in netrins, secreted molecules acting as guidance cues in neuronal path finding. The α1, β1, and γ1 subunits have been shown to be representatives of three distinct but closely related gene families, which consist of five, three, and three known members, respectively. Certain chains have been described as maintaining the domain structure of those in the original laminin-1 (e.g. α2 and β2) whereas others have N-terminal truncations presumably acquired in the process of evolutionary duplication (e.g. α4 and γ2) (9Maurer P. Engel J. Ekblom P. Timpl R. The Laminins. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1996: 27-50Google Scholar). The trimeric molecules formed by the combination of these chains may appear to have no short arms (e.g. laminin-5) (α3β3γ2) (10Rousselle P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) or have a Y shape on electron microscopy (e.g. laminin-7) (α3β2γ1) (11Champliaud M.F. Lunstrum G.P. Rousselle P. Nishiyama T. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 1189-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The laminin trimer is formed by assembly of the coiled-coil α-helical regions of the three chains, which results in the formation of the long arm structure (12Paulsson M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Dalzoppo D. Odermatt E. Engel J. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence in these regions must contain additional information, beyond the basic heptad repeat with hydrophobic residues in positions 1 and 4, since many but not all the theoretically possible heterotrimers are observed in vivo. Possibly, partially exclusive ionic bridges between the different chains play a role in increasing the stability in the formation of the coiled-coil α-helix (13Beck K. Dixon T.W. Engel J. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 231: 311-323Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Upon secretion, the laminin molecules aggregate to form a meshwork (14Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro this self-assembly is dependant upon Ca2+ (15Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is inhibited by chelating agents (14Yurchenco P.D. Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S. Furthmayr H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7636-7644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At high concentrations and in the presence of Ca2+, the laminin molecules align to produce an array through the interaction of the N-terminal globular LN domains (16Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. Colgnato H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1119-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Calcium ions are believed to produce a conformational change in the LN domains, allowing aggregation (15Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5425-5430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Paulsson M. Saladin K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18726-18732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The self-aggregation of laminin-1 is shared by many “full-sized” laminin isoforms but not by laminin-5 and -6, which contain chains with N-terminal truncations and thereby lack one or more LN domains (18Cheng Y.S. Champliaud M.F. Burgeson R.E. Marinkovich M.P. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31525-31532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). The polymerization of laminin-1 may be inhibited by proteolytic fragments that contain LN domains (19Schittny J.C. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 825-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 20Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fragment E4, containing the LN domain of the β1 chain, binds to a fragment representing the LN domains of the other two laminin-1 short arms with a KD of 1.4 μm, whereas homologous self-interactions are either very weak or do not occur (20Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, recombinant fragments representing the short arms of the α chains have also been shown able to inhibit laminin-1 polymer formation (21Colognato-Pyke H. O'Rear J.J. Yamada Y. Carbonetto S. Cheng Y.S. Yurchenco P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9398-9406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 22Garbe J.H. Gohring W. Mann K. Timpl R. Sasaki T. Biochem. J. 2002; 362: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Laminin self-aggregation is not the only mechanism needed for correct basement membrane assembly, since self-aggregation preferentially occurs while laminin is bound to cell surface receptors such as α-dystroglycan or integrins (23Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Yurchenco P.D. Morris G.E. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 24Colognato H. Yurchenco P.D. Curr. Biol. 1999; 18: 1327-1330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Google Scholar). However, upon binding to the laminin network, these receptors are also redistributed, which leads to a reorganization of the cortical cytoskeleton (25Colognato H. Winkelmann D.A. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 619-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Thus, the aggregation state of laminin in the basement membrane may have regulatory effects on cells. This is highlighted in organ culture experiments, where polymerization-blocking antibodies against laminin or laminin short arm structures inhibited basement membrane assembly and epithelial cell polarization (26Schuger L. Yurchenco P. Relan N.K. Yang Y. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 217-220PubMed Google Scholar) and smooth muscle cell differentiation (27Yang Y. Palmer K.C. Relan N. Diglio C. Schuger L. Development. 1998; 125: 2621-2629PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have also shown that polymerization-deficient laminins fail not only to form a basement membrane-like structure but are also unable to induce differentiation in embryonic stem cells (28Li S. Harrison D. Carbonetto S. Fassler R. Smyth N. Edgar D. Yurchenco P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Together these studies suggest that regulated laminin aggregation is highly significant for basement membrane-induced cellular differentiation and organogenesis. To understand the self-interaction mechanism of the laminin molecules in more detail, we have expressed recombinantly the LN domains from eight of the mouse laminin chains and have used these in binding assays. We could show that Ca2+ binding was shared between all of the chains but also that they have differing affinity for one another. This suggests that different laminin trimers may have a highly variable arrangement within the basement membrane. Expression and Purification of Murine LN Domains—Total RNA from adult mouse kidney was used as template for reverse transcription in all cases with the exception of β3 and γ3 subunits where RNA of skin from 3-day-old mice was chosen. Reverse transcription followed by PCR was carried out using the primers shown (Supplementary Table I). The amplified DNA fragments were digested with SpeI and NotI and cloned into the NheI-NotI-digested expression vector pCEP-pu BM40-cHis or pCEP-puBM40-cStrep (29Smyth N. Odenthal U. Merkl B. Paulsson M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1999; 139: 49-57Google Scholar). This produces a fusion protein where either a His6 tag or a Strep II tag is placed in frame with the LN coding regions. In the case of the γ1 domain, which contains an internal NotI site, the cDNA was cloned SpeI-XhoI into the same vectors. The plasmids were transfected into 293-EBNA cells by electroporation, and the cells were subsequently selected for puromycin resistance. Serum-free supernatants were tested for expression, after SDS-PAGE separation on a 10% gel, by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for either the His6 tag (penta-His horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody, Qiagen, Germany) or the Strep II tag (rabbit polyclonal serum; IBA, Germany). For His6 tag purification, supernatants were loaded on an IMAC column (Talon metal affinity resin; Clontech) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 5 column volumes of buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0) containing 2.5 mm imidazol, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient between 2.5 and 250 mm imidazol. In the case of Strep II-tagged proteins, supernatants were loaded on a StrepTactin-Sepharose column (IBA) at a flow of 0.3 ml/min. After washing with 10 column volumes of 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, the proteins were eluted with the same buffer containing 2.5 mm desthiobiotin. Native laminin-5, obtained after affinity purification from cell culture media, was a kind gift from Dr. R. Burgeson. Native PAGE—Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed on a 6% gel in a buffer containing 40 mm Bicine and 15 mm Tris at pH 8.3. Since LNα1 + 2LE and LNβ3 + 4LE did not run toward the anode under these conditions, they were rerun after switching the electrodes. Deglycosylation—Deglycosylation was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, or in denaturing buffer (New England Biolabs) after boiling for 10 min. Three μg of protein were incubated overnight with 200 units PNGase F (New England Biolabs) at 37 °C. Circular Dichroism—CD spectra were measured in a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter. Proteins were dialyzed against 5 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and had a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Measurements were performed in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2 or after the subsequent addition of EDTA to give a final concentration of 4 mm. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Assays—Assays were performed using a Biacore 2000 (BIAcore AB). Coupling of proteins to the CM5 chip was performed in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. A 7-min pulse of 0.05 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide, 0.2 m N-ethyl-N′-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide was used to activate the surface. The protein was injected until the desired amount was coupled (300–800 response units), and excess reactive groups were deactivated by a 7-min pulse of 1 m ethanolamine hydrochloride, pH 8.5. Measurements were carried out in HBS (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EDTA at a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The injection of 120 μl of the protein solution (0.1–10 μm) was followed by a 500-s dissociation. Each analysis was carried out a minimum of three times. The data were analyzed with BIAevaluation software version 3.0 according to the Langmuir model for 1:1 binding. All binding curves could be fitted with an accuracy of χ2 < 0.5 (see Supplementary Tables II–VI). xMAP-Luminex Binding Assays—Measurements were performed in a final total volume of 60 μ l of 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. For each data point 1 μl of stock nitrilotriacetic acid-coupled microspheres (Qiagen) was incubated with an excess of His6-tagged ligand for 4 h at 4 °C. After washing the microspheres, the analyte protein was added to give final concentrations from 0–200 μm. Analyte and ligand were gently agitated for 2 h at 25 °C before the addition of penta-His-Alexa 532-conjugated monoclonal antibody (Qiagen). The reaction mixture was then incubated for a further 90 min. Assays with microspheres alone and assays in the absence of the analyte were included as negative controls. Samples were analyzed using a Liqui-Chip-100 work station (Qiagen), and the level of fluorescence at 532 nm was measured. In the absence of analyte, only background signal was observed, indicating no binding of the penta-His antibody to either the microsphere or the coupled ligand. Cross-linking Assays—Cross-linking assays were carried out using the lysine side chain-reactive cross-linker bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) (Pierce). The proteins were added at a concentration of 2.5 mm, and the reaction was carried out in a final volume of 40 μl in HBS buffer and in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. For most assays, the cross-linker was used at a 200-fold molar excess over the protein concentration. The reaction was allowed to continue for 30 min at 25 °C and was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of 0.5 m Tris, pH 7.4. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis, the samples were dissolved in 5 μl of 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid. MALDI mass spectrometry was carried out in linear mode on a Bruker Reflex IV equipped with a video system, a nitrogen UV laser (Omax = 337 nm), and a HiMass detector. 1 μl of the sample solution was placed on the target, and 1 μl of a freshly prepared saturated solution of sinapinic acid in acetonitrile/H2O (2:1) with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid was added. The spot was then recrystallized by the addition of another 1 μl of acetonitrile/H2O (2:1), which resulted in a fine crystalline matrix. For recording of the spectra, an acceleration voltage of 20 kV was used, and the detector voltage was adjusted to 1.9 kV. Approximately 500 single laser shots were summed into an accumulated spectrum. Calibration was carried out using the single and doubly protonated ion signal of bovine serum albumin for external calibration. Expression and Purification of Laminin LN Domains—LN domains from eight full-length murine laminin chains were expressed and purified. Initial attempts to produce these domains without adjacent LE modules failed; however, recombinant expression did occur upon introducing one or more of the LE modules from domain V. The expression level was dependent upon the number of LE modules following the LN domain and varied between 2 and 15 mg/liter of conditioned medium, with the highest yields obtained from constructs containing four LE domains (Fig. 1). The individual domains were purified from the serum-free medium either by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography for the His6-tagged forms or by StrepTactin affinity chromatography where the Strep II-tag was used. Single step purification was sufficient to obtain the products at a high degree of purity (Fig. 2a). This was carried out at 4 °C, and protease inhibitors were used in all solutions; however, EDTA was omitted as it could possibly affect later divalent cation-dependent assays. SDS-PAGE of the purified recombinant proteins, without reduction of disulfide bonds, revealed distinct but weaker double bands for the β1- and β2-derived proteins (Fig. 2). These largely resolved upon reduction, which suggested that the proteins possibly had incomplete or variable disulfide closure. Also in the case of the γ3 LN domain, two bands were seen. However, these remained after treatment with β-mercaptoethanol, raising the possibility that a proportion of the protein had undergone limited proteolysis or some other post-translational modification. To investigate this, we tested all of the expressed LN domains for evidence of proteolysis. Edman degradation of each of the proteins revealed the expected N-terminal amino acid sequence (APLV), produced through cleavage by the signal peptidase of the BM40 fusion signal peptide used instead of the native signal sequence. Since the proteins were produced with C-terminal tags, immunoreactivity with tag-specific antibodies showed that C-terminal degradation had not occurred. The LN domains are all potentially N-glycosylated, with the α chains carrying the most asparagine residues suitable for substitution. Deglycosylation with endoglycosidase F resulted in a shift in electrophoretic mobility for all of the proteins, which was most marked in the cases of the α and γ chains (Fig. 2b). For the γ3 fragment, deglycosylation resulted in a single band showing that the two bands of differing mobility were due to variations in N-linked glycosylation. Analysis of the purified proteins by native PAGE in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 3) showed the products to run as single bands, suggesting that under these conditions and concentrations self-aggregation was not a major feature. LN Domain Interactions—Three independent assays were carried out to show interactions between the LN domains. Surface plasmon resonance was used to show binding and to obtain ka and kd values. All of the possible interactions were carried out in both directions (i.e. both with the proteins coupled and free in solution). These results were verified using the xMAP suspension binding assays. Finally, certain interactions were confirmed and further studied by covalent cross-linking using the water-soluble cross-linking agent BS3. Since laminin-1 polymerization has been the focus of most previous studies, our initial experiments using surface plasmon resonance tested the α1, β1, and γ1 LN domains found present in laminin-1 (Fig. 4, Table I, and Supplementary Tables II–VI). These assays were carried out at 25 °C, the temperature commonly used for such experiments. However, since temperature has been shown important in LN domain interactions, the analysis was repeated at 13 and 37 °C. At 13 °C, no binding was observed, whereas at 37 °C, signals indicative of aggregation occurred with nonreversible binding being seen. As expected from earlier experiments with proteolytic fragments (20Yurchenco P.D. Cheng Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17286-17299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binding between heterologous laminin-1 LN domains could be detected; a typical response curve is given in Fig. 4, showing the interactions of the α1 and β1 LN domains with a KD of 6.2 × 10–7m. Similarly, binding assays using the recombinant β1 LN domain showed that this failed to self-interact, again in agreement with the previous findings for the E4 fragment, which contains this domain. This lack of self-interaction was also seen for the γ1 LN domain, but the α1 domain interacted with a higher affinity (KD of 1.8 × 10–7m) with itself than seen for any heterotypic interactions of the LN domains of this laminin isoform. This clearly shows that homotypic interactions occur and can influence laminin network assembly.Table IKD values of interacting LN domains as measured by surface plasmon resonanceProtein on chipProtein in solutionα1α2α5β1β2β3γ1γ3α11.80 × 10-75.10 × 10-79.20 × 10-74.20 × 10-71.10 × 10-78.90 × 10-81.80 × 10-6NBaNB, no binding.α23.70 × 10-72.00 × 10-85.50 × 10-75.40 × 10-71.20 × 10-75.20 × 10-8NBNBα51.00 × 10-64.60 × 10-78.05 × 10-81.30 × 10-62.10 × 10-77.40 × 10-86.80 × 10-7NBβ12.40 × 10-86.50 × 10-71.22 × 10-7NB2.80 × 10-84.30 × 10-86.20 × 10-7NBβ29.40 × 10-83.20 × 10-72.00 × 10-73.60 × 10-87.00 × 10-85.30 × 10-82.60 × 10-74.10 × 10-7β38.40 × 10-86.18 × 10-75.50 × 10-75.30 × 10-84.00 × 10-84.90 × 10-81.40 × 10-71.70 × 10-7γ11.20 × 10-7NB5.50 × 10-74.70 × 10-71.70 × 10-71.50 × 10-7NBNBγ3NBNBNBNB1.00 × 10-71.80 × 10-7NBNBa NB, no binding. Open table in a new tab We then studied the possibility of self-interaction for the other laminin LN domains by surface plasmon resonance (Table I and Supplementary Tables II–VI). We found that both the α2 and α5 LN domains self-interact in a manner similar to that of the α1 domain. Whereas the γ3-derived LN domain, like its γ1 counterpart in laminin-1, failed to self-interact, both β2 and β3 LN domains did, in contrast to the results obtained for β1 LN domain. In studies of the interactions between LN domains from the same class of laminin chain, we found evidence of α-α and β-β intragroup heterodimers for all members. However, the two γ chain-derived LN domains showed no interaction. When intergroup binding was analyzed, α-β interactions were seen with all combinations, whereas the γ LN domains again showed a more limited binding repertoire. The γ1 LN domain could be shown to bind to all β chains; however, it failed to interact with the α2 LN domain despite binding to those of α1 and α5. The γ3 LN domain is the most highly restricted in its binding partners, failing to bind to any α chain LN domain, and interacting only with those of β2 and β3. Previous studies have shown the importance of Ca2+ in laminin gel formation. To study this further, the role of divalent cations was evaluated through the addition of EDTA to the analyte in the surface plasmon resonance experiments. In all cases, binding could be inhibited upon Ca2+ removal, a change that was reversible upon the readdition of Ca2+ ions. Circular dichroism spectra were measured and showed that there was a marked reduction in secondary structure for most but not all domains in the absence of Ca2+ ions, since there was no evidence for a change in conformation for the α2-, α5-, or γ3-derived LN domains (Fig. 5). Independent results on the LN domain interactions were obtained using a xMAP suspension assay. Here the ligand is bound in an orientated manner to the surface of a fluorescent microbead via its His6 tag. After washing to remove unbound ligand, the beads are incubated with the analyte. The aligned microbeads are passed in single file through two lasers, and any interaction is detected by measuring a second fluorochrome emitting at a separate wavelength, which is coupled to an antibody directed against this analyte. The degree of antibody fluorescence (i.e. the ratio between the background signal and that occurring as the bead passes the lasers) is obtained to give relative fluorescence response units. In our study, antibodies to the His6 tag were used to detect the interaction. Initial experiments showed that protein binding to the beads resulted in the masking of its His6 tag from the penta-His antibody, thus allowing binding studies to be carried out of two proteins carrying the same tag. To compare the results of the xMAP and the surface plasmon resonance assays, primary studies with various protein combinations were carried out, bringing the analyte concentration to excess. To obtain quantitative results, high levels of the detecting antibody were required as increased free analyte competes for antibody binding to the bead complex. The observed KD values were comparable with those obtained from surface plasmon resonance (Table II). All possible interactions were then analyzed in one direction and showed similar results to those seen in surface plasmon resonance (Table III), with the one exception of the β2-β2 LN domain interaction, where for unknown reasons high background made it impossible to verify a specific interaction. Typical binding results are shown in Fig. 6 for β2 LN domains coupled to the bead and the β3 LN domain in solution.Table IIComparison of KD values obtained by surface plasmon resonance and by xMAP-Luminex analysisLigandAnalyteKD-xMAP[M]KD-SPR[M]aSPR, surface plasmon resonance.β1β1NBbNB, no binding.NBβ1β21.23 × 10-82.80 × 10-8β1β34.94 × 10-84.30 × 10-8β2β33.98 × 10-95.30 × 10-8β3β31.75 × 10-84.90 × 10-8β1γ13.34 × 10-86.20 × 10-7γ1β26.48 × 10-91.70 × 10-7γ1β33.47 × 10-81.50 × 10-7γ3β1NBNBγ3β28.53 × 10-91.00 × 10-7γ3β32.63 × 10-81.80 × 10-7γ1γ1NBNBγ1γ3NBNBγ3γ3NBNBα1β15.43 × 10-84.20 × 10-7a SPR, surface plasmon resonance.b NB, no binding.

The present method can be readily extended to other glycosidases and should greatly aid the high throughput proteomics of many glycoside hydrolases showing both retaining- and inverting-type mechanisms. The fate of cell surface carbohydrates bearing proteins and lipids is controlled by the systematic enzymatic reactions. Functional oligosaccharide chains of glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycolipids produced by glycosyltransferases are eventually degraded by the specific individual metabolic systems (1Dwek R.A. Chem. Rev. 1996; 96: 683-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (2827) Google Scholar). Glycoside hydrolases (GHs, 1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time of flight; TOF/TOF, time of flight/time of flight; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.1The abbreviations used are: GH, glycoside hydrolase; MALDI, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization; TOF, time of flight; TOF/TOF, time of flight/time of flight; dansyl, 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl; ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. carbohydrases, glycosidases; EC 3.2.1) take part in such degradation of the glycoconjugates (2Sears P.

In addition, it is well known that glycoside hydrolases for α-d-mannopyranosides (α-mannosidases) have crucial roles as trimming enzymes in the glycoprotein synthetic pathways to control the eventual types of oligosaccharide structures such as high mannose type, hybrid type, and complex type (5Roth J.

Therefore, precise analysis of the structures, functions, and catalytic mechanism of GHs has become one of the most important processes in systematic biosynthesis and metabolism of glycoconjugates. Moreover, it is also evident that fine structural information on the active site of GHs permits rational design and efficient synthesis of potential modulators or inhibitors such as sugar-based therapeutic reagents (7von Itzstein M. Wu W.Y. Kok G.B. Pegg M.S. Dyason J.C. Jin B. Van Phan T. Smythe M.L. White H.F. Oliver S.W. Colman P.M. Varghese J.N. Ryan D.M. Woods J.M. Bethell R.C. Hotham V.J. Cameron J.M. Penn C.R.

However, large scale expression and crystallization of proteins often become a bottle neck in the practical protein engineering as well as basic proteomics research and structural biology.Recent progress in mass spectroscopy based on various ionization techniques such as matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI) techniques greatly facilitated proteomic analysis useful for post-genomic science and technology. In fact, combined use of mass spectroscopy with HPLC or two-dimensional PAGE seems to be the most powerful set of tools for high throughput proteomics research (14Keough T. Lacey M.P. Fieno A.M.

In the present paper, we report an efficient method for isolation and characterization of galactosidases based on fluorescence labeling by a suicide substrate. The value of this method for high throughput proteomics study was demonstrated using Xanthomonas manihotis β-galactosidase as a model GH.β-Galactosidases (EC 3.2.1.23) are exo-type GHs that release terminal d-galactopyranose residues from oligosaccharide chains in a variety of glycoconjugates. They are distributed widely in a number of microorganisms, plants, and animal tissues (18Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Human isozymes of β-galactosidase have been investigated extensively from the standpoint of genetic disorders such as lactose intolerance (19Montgomery R.K. Buller H.A. Rings E.H. Grand R.J. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2824-2832Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and mucolipidosis (20Kobayashi T. Ohta M. Goto I. Tanaka Y. Kuroiwa Y. J.

Acta. 1999; 1455: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Bacterial isozymes of β-galactosidases served as reporter molecules for the evaluation of gene regulation (25Lapierre L. Mollet B. Germond J.E. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 928-935Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidases are divided into four distinct GH families, GH-1, GH-2, GH-35, and GH-42, based on the similarity in nucleotide and amino acid sequences (26Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2592) Google Scholar, 27Henrissat B. Bairoch A. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar, 28Henrissat B.

Plant Physiol. 2000; 124: 1515-1519Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, at present, only limited information on the three-dimensional structure, substrate binding site, catalytic site, and posttranslational modifications is available. Considering the difficulties in isolation and characterization as well as expression of various isozymes of β-galactosidases, an alternative method to alleviate these time-consuming and tedious procedures for the functional proteomics of the GHs is highly desired.In 1990, Danzin and co-workers (30Halazy S. Berges V. Ehrhard A. Danzin C. Bioorg. Chem. 1990; 18: 330-344Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar) developed and reported an irreversible inhibitor (suicide substrate) of β-galactosidases based on a fluoromethylated aryl group as a novel aglycon. The reactive moiety generated from an aglycon conveniently labeled the active site of the GHs for subsequent characterization because nucleophilic attack of this aglycon by a nearby amino acid side chain at the active site gives rise to a tagged amino acid residue. Subsequently, applications of this principle have emerged. Ichikawa and Ichikawa (31Ichikawa M. Ichikawa Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2001; 11: 1769-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) developed novel biotin-conjugated suicide substrates for isolation and characterization of N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase. Janda et al. (32Janda K.D. Lo L.C. Lo C.H. Sim M.M. Wang R. Wong C.H. Lerner R.A. Science. 1997; 275: 945-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) have reported a valuable application of this tagging strategy for chemical selection of a catalytic antibody having β-galactosidase-like activity from a phage library. Plückthun and co-workers (33Cesaro-Tadic S. Lagos D. Honegger A. Rickard J.H. Partridge L.J. Blackburn G.M. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) have also succeeded in trapping a catalyst with alkaline phosphatase activity by using a similar mechanism-based chemical selection strategy.In adopting this principle, we chose fluorescent labeling of GH followed by peptide fingerprinting by mass spectroscopy in the high throughput proteomics of GHs. When a glycosidase is expressed and produced using common bacterial systems, identification of the target protein in a cell lysate, a complex mixture of proteins and other biomolecules, requires a rather tedious sequence of blotting, digestion, and staining procedures prior to mass spectroscopic analyses (17Henzel W.J. Watanabe C. Stults J.T. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2003; 14: 931-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition, complexity of peptide fragments derived by treating the tagged proteins with specific peptidases still makes precise analyses of peptide sequences difficult. Therefore, we thought that irreversible fluorescence labeling of GHs would facilitate isolation and identification of labeled active site peptides as well as labeled GHs. We herein demonstrate that a mechanism-based tagging of β-galactosidases with a fluorescence-labeled suicide substrate (Fig. 1) greatly expedited both an efficient chromatographic separation and an accurate sequencing of the labeled peptides by means of a tandem mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF/TOF).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and General Methods—Recombinant β-galactosidase from X. manihotis was purchased from New England BioLabs. β-Galactosidases from Escherichia coli (lacZ), Aspergillus oryzae, bovine liver, and endoproteinase Glu-C (EC 3.4.21.19) were obtained from Sigma. β-Galactosidases from Bacillus circulans, trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4), and Affinity-Gel 10 were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Co. Ltd. Antidansyl rabbit IgG was obtained from Molecular Probes Inc. Donkey anti-rabbit IgG (H + L), alkaline phosphate conjugate, and Western Blue® (stabilized substrate for alkaline phosphatase) were purchased from Promega Co. Ltd. All other chemical reagents were purchased from Wako Chemical Co. Ltd. All chemical reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents under nitrogen atmosphere in the dark. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography on precoated plates of Silica Gel 60F254 (Merck). Visualization was accomplished with UV light (254 or 365 nm) and anisaldehyde:methanol:sulfuric acid (10:5:85 (v/v/v)) solution or ninhydrin reagent (Wako Co.) followed by heating. Purifications of the synthetic products by column chromatography were carried out using Silica Gel 60N (KANTO Co., 63–210 nm of mesh). Melting points were measured and determined with a Yamato micromelting point apparatus.NMR Spectroscopy—1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, with a Lambda 400 spectrometer (JEOL) using chloroform-d and methanol-d4 as solvents. All signals of the new compounds synthesized in this study were characterized with H-H COSY and heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence techniques.MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry (34Schnaible V.

Typically, samples were dissolved in 1 μl of 90% (v/v) acetonitrile containing trifluoroacetic acid and mixed with the same volume of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 33% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The above mixtures (1 μl) were applied to a stainless steel target MALDI plate and air-dried before analysis in the mass spectrometer. All measurements were performed using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a reflector and controlled by the Flexcontrol 1.2 software package (Bruker Daltonics GmbsH, Bremen, Germany). Ions generated by a pulsed UV laser beam (nitrogen laser, λ = 337 nm) were accelerated to a kinetic energy of 23.5 kV. Metastable ions generated by laser-induced decomposition of the selected precursor ions were analyzed without any additional collision gas. Precursor ions were accelerated to 8 kV and selected in a timed ion gate. The fragments were further accelerated by 19 kV in the LIFT cell (LIFT means “lifting” the potential energy for the second acceleration of the ion source), and their masses were analyzed after the ion reflector passage. Masses were automatically annotated by using XMASS 5.1.2 NT.External calibration of MALDI mass spectra was carried out using singly charged monoisotopic peaks of a mixture of human angiotensin II (m/z 1046.542), bombesin (m/z 1619.823), ACTH (18Sinnott M.L.

The mixture of these peptides was measured on the central spot of a 3 × 3 square by using external calibration. To achieve mass accuracy better than 60 ppm, internal calibration was carried out by doping the matrix solution with a mixture of the calibration peptides. Calibration of these mass spectra was performed automatically by utilizing a customized macro command of the XMASS 5.1.2 NT software package. The macro command was used for the calibration of the monoisotopic singly charged peaks of the above mentioned peptides. LIFT-TOF/TOF spectra were annotated with the BioTools 2.1 software package.Synthesis of a Fluorescence-labeled Suicide Substrate—A key synthetic intermediate, 2-difluoromethyl-4-nitro-phenyl 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (compound 1) was prepared from 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-α-d-galactopyranosyl bromide according to the procedure reported in a previous paper (32Janda K.D.

The mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The solution was adjusted with Dowex 50W-X8 (H+) to pH 7.0 and evaporated after filtration with Celite® to afford a syrupy de-O-acetylated derivative. The crude product 2 (2-difluoromethyl-4-nitro-phenyl β-d-galactopyranoside; RF = 0.56 (CHCl3:MeOH: H2O = 65:25:4)) (68 mg, 193 μmol) was dissolved in dry ethyl acetate (5 ml). To this solution was added 10% palladium on activated carbon (30 mg), and the mixture was stirred under H2 atmosphere at room temperature for 16 h. The mixture was filtered with Celite®, and the solution was evaporated to give an intermediate 3 (60 mg) in quantitative yield.4-Amino-2-difluoromethylphenyl β-d-galactopyranoside (intermediate 3) (RF = 0.40 (CHCl3:MeOH:H2O = 65:25:4)) (60 mg, 190 μmol) was dissolved in dry MeOH (3 ml) and mixed with triethylamine (50 μl, 400 μmol), to which dansyl chloride (80 mg, 300 μmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature in the dark for 16 h.

Dance N.E. Biochem. J. 1976; 157: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as a competitive substrate (λex = 365 nm, λem = 440 nm). The inhibition constants (Ki) and the half-life for inhibition (t½) were determined according to the procedure described in the literature (37Tipton K.F. Engel P.C. Enzymology LABFAX. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1996: 151-171Google Scholar). Kinetic data were obtained from each of the five enzymes and are shown in Fig. 2.Fig. 2Kinetic behavior of the specific irreversible inhibitor 4. To a solution of β-galactosidase and 0–1.5 mm fluorescence-labeled substrate was added 4-methylumberyferyl β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration of 3 mm), and changes in the hydrolytic activity of the enzyme were determined by measuring the relative fluorescence intensity. a, β-galactosidase from A. oryzae. b, β-galactosidase from bovine liver. c, β-galactosidase from B. circulans. d, β-galactosidase from X. manihotis. e, β-galactosidase from E. coli. f, relationship between Ki and t½.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mechanism-based Labeling of β-Galactosidases—β-Galactosidase (300–1000 μg) was incubated in the presence or absence of suicide substrate 4 (5 μg, final concentration of 45 μm) at 37 °Cin200 μlof100 mm citrate phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) or 100 mm Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5). The reaction mixture was subjected directly to purification by gel permeation chromatography using a GS510 7E column (Shodex) with 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl and 0.1% (v/v) SDS as the eluent (flow rate of 0.3 ml/min). Chromatography was monitored by means of a HITACHI L-6200 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a HITACHI L-7405 UV detector and a HITACHI F-1050 fluorescence spectrophotometer. Efficacy of fluorescent labeling of enzymes under the conditions described above was estimated to be in the range of 10–30% by elucidating the fluorescence peak area derived from the labeled proteins. The mixture of labeled and unlabeled proteins was directly used for further enzymatic digestion and isolation procedures of the target-labeled peptide fragment. Considering Ki values obtained from the kinetic analysis (Fig. 2), it is clear that a large excess of suicide substrate 4 would be required for complete labeling of enzymes. In this study, however, this was settled on 45 μm suicide substrate 4 because of its limited solubility.Western Blotting of Dansylated β-Galactosidases—Each labeled β-galactosidase (1–50 μg) was applied to 5–20% polyacrylamide gels (ATTO Co. Ltd., Japan) followed by SDS-PAGE. All samples were heated prior to application to SDS-PAGE wells. Proteins were blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immun-Blot™ polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, Bio-Rad), and the dansylated proteins were detected with the donkey anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Promega. Co. Ltd.) and antidansyl rabbit IgG complex using Western Blue® (Promega. Co. Ltd) as a substrate for alkaline phosphatase. After blocking using 0.3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline buffer, the primary and secondary antibodies were used at a dilution of 1:5000 (about 0.2 μg/ml), exposed to the membranes for 30 min at 37 °C, and washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween 20 at each step. The final development with alkaline phosphatase was performed at 37 °C for 20 min.Enzymat"
https://openalex.org/W2138568466,"By screening cDNA expression libraries derived from fresh leukemic cells of adult T-cell leukemia for the potential to transform murine fibroblasts, NIH3T3, we have identified a novel transforming gene, designated Tgat. Expression of Tgat in NIH3T3 resulted in the loss of contact inhibition, increase of saturation density, anchorage-independent growth in a semisolid medium, tumorigenicity in nude mice, and increased invasiveness. Sequence comparison revealed that an alternative RNA splicing of the Trio gene was involved in the generation of Tgat. The Tgat cDNA encoded a protein product consisting of the Rho-guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domain of a multifunctional protein, TRIO, and a unique C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence, which were derived from the exons 38-46 of the Trio gene and a novel exon located downstream of its last exon (exon 58), respectively. A Tgat mutant cDNA lacking the C-terminal coding region preserved Rho-GEF activity but lost the transforming potential, indicating an indispensable role of the unique sequence. On the other hand, treatment of Tgat-transformed NIH3T3 cells with Y-27632, a pharmacological inhibitor of Rho-associated kinase, abrogated their transforming phenotypes, suggesting the coinvolvement of Rho-GEF activity. Thus, alternative RNA splicing, resulting in the fusion protein with the Rho-GEF domain and the unique 15 amino acids, is the mechanism generating the novel oncogene, Tgat.

Human cancer develops as a consequence of multiple genetic alterations that allow cells to escape normal cell-growth regulation (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21921) Google Scholar). These genetic alterations include chromosomal amplification, deletion, translocations, and somatic point mutation, leading to proto-oncogene activation or suppressor oncogene inactivation. One of the approaches to identifying the gain-of-function of oncogenes in cancer cells has been phenotypic screening of cultured cells transfected with cancer cell-derived genomic DNAs or cDNA libraries. Indeed, a number of cellular oncogenes that are susceptible to single-hit oncogenic transformation have been identified in transfected murine fibroblasts NIH3T3 (2Shimizu K. Goldfarb M. Perucho M. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 383-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 3Martin-Zanca D. Hughes S.H. Barbacid M.

The oncogenic potential of certain oncogenes have been easily identified in NIH3T3 cells by loss of contact inhibition and anchorage-independent growth in vitro as well as tumorigenicity in vivo. Theoretically, phenotypic screening has advantages in detecting subtle genomic change, such as the point mutation of ras genes, and the alterations involved in post-transcriptional processes, leading to the gain-of-function of oncogenes.Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) 1The abbreviations used are: ATL, adult T-cell leukemia; Tgat, trio-related transforming gene in ATL tumor cells; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HTLV-I, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, rhoteckin Rho binding domain; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology.1The abbreviations used are: ATL, adult T-cell leukemia; Tgat, trio-related transforming gene in ATL tumor cells; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HTLV-I, human T-cell lymphotrophic virus, type I; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, rhoteckin Rho binding domain; ROCK, Rho-associated kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; DH, Dbl homology; PH, pleckstrin homology. is associated with prior infection with HTLV-I, but the mechanisms by which leukemogenesis occurs, are not fully defined.

Moreover, ATL cells occasionally harbor intact HTLV-I proviruses encoding nonfunctional TAX (19Okazaki S. Moriuchi R. Yosizuka N. Sugahara K. Maeda T. Jinnai I. Tomonaga M. Kamihira S. Katamine S. Virus Genes. 2001; 23: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 20Furukawa Y. Kubota R. Tara M. Izumo S. Osame M. Blood. 2001; 97: 987-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) or lacking 5′-long terminal repeat essential for TAX expression (21Tamiya S. Matsuoka M. Etoh K. Watanabe T. Kamihira S. Yamaguchi K. Takatsuki K. Blood. 1996; 88: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), arguing against the role of TAX in malignant ATL phenotypes in patients. In severe combined immunodeficient mice, the expression of TAX alone failed to support neoplastic growth of T cells (22Imada K. Takaori-Kondo A. Akagi T. Shimotohno K. Sugamura K. Hattori T. Yamabe H. Okuma M. Uchiyama T. Blood. 1995; 86: 2350-2357Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The long latency of ATL also suggests the age-dependent accumulation of leukemogenic events within HTLV-I-infected T-cells (23Okamoto T. Ohno Y. Tsugane S. Watanabe S. Shimoyama M. Tajima K. Miwa M. Shimotohno K. Jpn. J. Cancer Res. 1989; 80: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recently, abnormalities in tumor suppressor genes such as p53, p15, or p16 have been identified with high frequency in ATL cells. Additional changes in the cellular genome and/or transcriptome are likely to be involved in leukemogenesis and malignant phenotypes of ATL cells in vivo.In the present study, we constructed cDNA expression libraries using a retroviral vector from fresh ATL cells and screened for cDNAs with the potential to transform NIH3T3 cells. The identified novel transforming gene, designated trio-related transforming gene in ATL tumor cells (Tgat), was generated by alternative RNA splicing between a part of the Trio gene encoding Rho-GEF (from exons 38 to 46) and a novel exon located downstream of the last exon of Trio (exon 58). Both the Rho-GEF activity and the C-terminal region of Tgat were required for its transforming activity. A potential role of Tgat in ATL is also discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Constructs—A retroviral vector, pDON/SfiI/PacI, and pBluescript/SfiI/PacI were constructed by modifying pDON-AI (Takara) and pBluescript SK(+) (Stratagene), respectively, as described previously (24Miki T. Matsui T. Heidaran M.A. Aaronson S.A. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 83: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To make TgatΔC and TgatPH2, PCR-amplified DNA fragments were ligated into pDON-AI and confirmed by DNA sequencing.Cells and Cell Lines—Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from two acute-type ATL patients. The experimental protocol was approved by the Ethics Review Committee for Human Experimentation of our institution, and informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The rodent fibroblast NIH3T3 cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% calf serum. The 293 10A-1 packaging cell line (IMGENEX) was maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of blasticidin S (20 μg/ml).Library Construction and Transduction to NIH3T3 Cells—cDNA was made from 1 μg of total RNA using a SMART cDNA library construction kit (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fractions of cDNA greater than 1 kb were used for the library construction. Supernatants were recovered 48 h after transfection of the plasmid DNA library into the 293 10A-1 packaging cell line. This library produced viral titers of 3 × 106 colony-forming units/ml. Recombinant retrovirus libraries were infected to NIH3T3 cells (multiplicity of infection = 0.1-1). The infected NIH3T3 cells were cultivated for 2-4 weeks.cDNA Rescue—Genomic DNAs were purified from transformed foci and used for cDNA rescue by nested PCR using vector primers. The thermal cycles were as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 25 cycles at 95 °C for 0.5 min, 62 °C for 0.5 min, then 68 °C for 3 min. The amplified DNA was then digested by SfiI enzyme (Promega) and subcloned into pBluescript/SfiI/PacI vector for further screening. All sequences were compared against the GenBank™ databases by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST).Tumor Growth in Nude Mice—Four- to six-week-old athymic BALB-c/nu/nu mice were injected with 1 × 106 cells in 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline from transformed clones. Tumors were measured after 4 weeks.Immunofluorescence—For actin localization, stable cell lines were cultured for 2 days on LabTek chamber microscope slides (Nalge Nunc) in normal media and then serum-starved for 16 h and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. Slides were then sequentially incubated with anti-vinculin antibodies (Sigma), fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratory Inc.), rhodamine-phalloidin, and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Molecular Probes). Images were obtained using an Axiovert microscope and the Axiovision capture system (Carl Zeiss).Affinity Precipitation of Cellular GTP-Rho—We used a Rho activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) to detect cellular GTP-Rho according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cell lysates were incubated with GST-RBD (rhoteckin Rho binding domain, 40 μg)-agarose beads at 4 °C for 45 min. The beads were washed four times with wash buffer, and bound Rho protein was detected by Western blotting using a polyclonal antibody against Rho A.In Vitro Invasion Assay—A Biocoat Matrigel Invasion Chamber (BD Biosciences Labware) was used for monitoring the in vitro cell invasion assay, which was performed as described previously (25Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). The lower chambers were filled with DMEM, supplemented with 5% calf serum. NIH3T3 cells (1 × 105), stably expressing Tgat, TgatΔC, TgatPH2, and V12ras and suspended in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin, were placed in the upper components of the chamber. After incubation for 22 h at 37 °C in a 95% air and 5% CO2 atmosphere, the filters were removed, fixed with methanol, and stained with toluidine blue. Each assay was set up in triplicate, and all data were analyzed statistically by t tests.RESULTSCloning of Transforming Genes Expressed in ATL Cells—Infection of NIH3T3 cells with the recombinant viruses containing cDNAs derived from ATL leukemic cells gave a number of foci 2 weeks post-infection, about one-third of which showed anchorage-independent growth in a semisolid medium. Sequence analysis identified a particular cDNA species, designated Tgat (trio-related transforming gene in ATL tumor cells), which was shared by 6 of the 10 independent anchorage-independent colonies analyzed (Tgat sequence was submitted to DDBJ; accession number, AB115332). Unfortunately, another four colonies contained multiple cDNAs, and all rescued cDNA could not independently transform NIH3T3 cells. Interestingly, Tgat was also identified in the foci of NIH3T3 cells infected with two other cDNA libraries derived from independent patients with acute ATL. To confirm the transforming potential of Tgat, the cDNA amplified from an anchorage-independent colony was recloned in pDON/SfiI/PacI and expressed in NIH3T3 cells. The morphology of foci induced by Tgat showed extensive aggregation of the cells at the center of the focus leading to an overall punctate appearance, and the number of foci was dose-dependent on the transfected DNA (Fig. 1). The transformed NIH3T3 cells exhibited reduced cell doubling time and grew to a higher cell density. Moreover, subcutaneous inoculation of the transformed cells produced tumors in athymic nude mice within 30 days. In contrast, none of the mice inoculated with control cells with empty vectors developed tumors during the 3-month observation period.Tgat Encodes Rho-GEF followed by 15 Unique Amino Acids—The nucleotide sequencing of the Tgat cDNA (1,574 bp) and searches using the GenBank™ nucleotide sequence data bank revealed a homology to the cDNA for the multifunctional protein Trio, which comprises spectrin-like domains, two functional guanosine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) domains, and a protein serine/threonine kinase domain (26Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The Trio gene consists of 58 exons, which are distributed in the 380-kb region of chromosome 5p14-15.1. The 5′-half of the Tgat cDNA, 771 bp, was completely identical to the Trio exons 38-46 encoding the GEF-D2 sequence, but the following 803-bp sequence appeared to be unique. A genome data base search revealed that this unique sequence was derived from a novel exon located 1.6 kb downstream of the poly(A) site on the last exon (exon 58) of Trio (Fig. 2a), indicating the involvement of alternative RNA splicing between exon 46 and the novel downstream exon. 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments suggested that Tgat expression was driven by a putative cryptic promoter located upstream of exon 38 of the Trio genome (data not shown). The Tgat cDNA contained an open reading frame, which was initiated from the ATG codon conforming to the Kozak consensus sequence (27Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) located at 48-bp downstream from the 5′ terminus of the cDNA and encoding a protein product with 255 amino acids. Sequence comparisons revealed that N-terminal 241 amino acids corresponding to the Trio GEF-D2 domain were followed by the unique C-terminal 15 amino acids encoded by the novel downstream exon (Fig. 2b).Fig. 2Structure of Tgat.a, alternative splicing of the Tgat transcript derived from the gene locus encoding Trio. The black and gray boxes represent exons of Trio and Tgat, respectively. b, comparison of the primary structures of Tgat and Trio proteins. The shaded box in Tgat represents the unique 15-amino acid sequence encoded by the novel downstream exon. The boxes in Trio represent multiple functional domains. SP, spectrin-like domain; GEF-D, guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain; PH, pleckstrin-homology domain; Ig, immunoglobulin-like domain; PSK, serine/threonine kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The C-terminal 15 Amino Acids Encoded by Tgat Are Crucial for Its Transforming Activity—To explore the role of the unique C-terminal region of the Tgat protein, we examined the transforming potential of TgatΔC lacking the C-terminal 15 amino acids. Deletion of the 15 amino acids completely abrogated the transforming activity of Tgat in vitro and in vivo (Fig. 3). TgatPH2, in which the C-terminal 15 amino acids were replaced by the PH2 domain of Trio, also failed to transform NIH3T3 cells. These results indicate that the C-terminal 15 amino acids of Tgat play a crucial role in the transforming potential and that the Trio PH domain cannot replace its function.Fig. 3Transforming activities of Tgat and Tgat mutants.a, Tgat comprises the Rho-GEF-D2 domain of Trio and the unique C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence.

Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H. Streuli M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5466-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Rho activation usually leads to the formation of contractile actin-myosin stress fibers and associated focal adhesion complexes. ROCKs (Rho-associated kinases) and Dia activated by binding to Rho-GTP are thought to be involved in the Rho-induced assembly of stress fibers and focal adhesions (28Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4a, expression of Tgat, as well as TgatPH2 or TgatΔC, in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts induced clear contractile actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes, which are characteristic of Rho activation and not of Rac or cdc42 activation. To confirm Rho activation in the cells, the quantity of Rho-GTP was directly measured by a GST-RBD pull-down assay (Fig. 4b). The level of Rho-GTP induced by Tgat was similar to that in the cells treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) or transformed by TgatPH2, whereas TgatΔC failed to fully activate Rho. The PH domain is thought to mediate membrane localization through lipid binding and directly affect the activity of the DH domain (26Debant A. Serra-Pages C. Seipel K. O'Brien S. Tang M. Park S.H.

As a positive control, untransfected cells were treated with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA). Focal adhesion complexes and filamentous actin structures were visualized using anti-vinculin antibodies and phalloidin, respectively. 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used for nuclear staining. b, quantitative detection of cellular GTP-Rho in Swiss 3T3 cells stably expressing Tgat and its mutants using GST-RBD-glutathione beads. The values represent the relative amount of GTPRho in each type of construct-transfected Swiss 3T3 cell to that in the LPA-stimulated cells. The mean ± S.E. for three independent assays is presented. Tgat and TgatPH2 increase the amounts of Rho retained on the beads to the equivalent level reached by LPA stimulation (10 μm for 5 min). c, involvement of ROCK in the transformation by Tgat. Foci of NIH3T3 cells, infected with the indicated titers of the recombinant retrovirus encoding Tgat and maintained for 14 days in the presence (upper) or absence (lower) of 10 μm Y-27632 (Calbiochem), were visualized by using Giemsa staining.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)ROCK Inhibitor Abrogates the Transforming Activity of Tgat—To elucidate the role of Rho-GEF activity in the Tgat-induced transformation, Tgat was expressed in NIH3T3 cells in the presence of a pharmacological ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632 (31Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2518) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4c, Y-27632 completely abrogated focus formation by Tgat. These data support the conclusion that both the DH domain and the unique C-terminal region of Tgat are necessary for the transforming activity.Tgat Expression Induces Invasion Capability—Tiam1 (T-lymphoma invasion and metastasis 1), another member of the DH protein family, is reported to induce an invasive phenotype in otherwise noninvasive lymphoma cell lines (32Habets G.G. Scholtes E.H. Zuydgeest D. van der Kammen R.A. Stam J.C. Berns A. Collard J.G. Cell. 1994; 77: 537-549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 33Michiels F. Habets G.G. Stam J.C. van der Kammen R.A. Collard J.G. Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether the expression of Tgat could affect the invasiveness of NIH3T3 cells using an in vitro invasion assay (25Albini A. Iwamoto Y. Kleinman H.K. Martin G.R. Aaronson S.A. Kozlowski J.M. McEwan R.N. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 3239-3245PubMed Google Scholar). The invasiveness of Tgat-expressing cells was about 12-fold higher than that of TgatPH2- or TgatΔC-expressing cells. Moreover, Tgat had an edge over the activated oncogene (V12ras) in invasion-inducing ability. Y-27632 treatment of Tgat-expressing cells reduced its invasiveness, but the effect was insufficient. These results suggest that the existence of the unique C-terminal region outweighs the Rho-GEF activity for the invasion-inducing ability of Tgat (Fig. 5, a and b).Fig. 5Invasion activities of NIH3T3 cells expressing Tgat, its mutants, and activated ras (V12).a, cells were allowed to migrate for 22 h through polycarbonate filters coated with Matrigel. b, the migrated cells were stained and then counted by using light microscopy. The results are the mean ± S.E. of n = 5 per group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONRho family proteins were initially cloned on the basis of their similarity to the Ras oncoproteins. Like Ras, Rho family proteins have lipid modifications that target them to cell membranes, and cycle between GTP- and GDP-bound states. Binding to GTP is promoted by Rho-GEFs, and GTP hydrolysis is catalyzed by Rho-GTPase-activating proteins. Unlike Ras, there are no reports of mutated, constitutively active forms of Rho proteins in tumors. However, recent work has shown that Rho proteins are overexpressed in several human tumors (34Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar).The Dbl proteins, a family of Rho-GEFs that transduce diverse intracellular signals leading to the activation of Rho family GTPases, contain a tandem Dbl homology (DH) domain/pleckstrin homology (PH) domain structure. The DH domain is a catalytic region of the protein, whereas the PH domain regulates the DH domain as well as the subcellular localization of the Dbl protein (35Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). Many Dbl family proteins, such as Dbl (6Eva A. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1985; 316: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), Vav (36Katzav S. Martin-Zanca D. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2283-2290Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar), Ect2 (37Miki T. Smith C.L. Long J.E. Eva A. Fleming T.P. Nature. 1993; 362: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar), Lfc (38Whitehead I. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), and Lsc (39Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18643-18650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), were originally identified in gene transfer screening studies as novel oncoproteins that cause transformation of NIH3T3 cells. For a number of Dbl proteins, activation of these transforming activities was a result of either N-terminal or C-terminal truncation of sequences that flank the conserved DH/PH domains. The rearrangements that led to activation of transforming activity were due to artifacts of the transfection procedure, although some of these screenings involved the analysis of DNA from tumor cell lines. Thus no Dbl family protein has been found to be aberrantly activated in human cancers except BCR, rearranged in the leukemia-associated BCR-Abl translocation gene product, and LARG, a fusion partner with MLL in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (40Reuther G.W. Lambert Q.T. Booden M.A. Wennerberg K. Becknell B. Marcucci G. Sondek J. Caligiuri M.A. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27145-27151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar).In the case of Tgat, the PH domain is spliced out and the unique C-terminal 15 amino acids follow the Rho-GEF domain. Because TgatΔC containing the DH domain alone and TgatPH2 showed no transforming activity in the in vitro and in vivo assays, the unique C-terminal 15 amino acids are essential for the transforming activity of Tgat (Fig. 3). Moreover, a Tgat mutant, which lacked GEF activity due to a single amino acid substitution, also showed no transforming activity (data not shown), and inhibition of ROCK using a pharmacological inhibitor (Y-27632) caused the loss of the foci produced by Tgat (Fig. 4c). These results suggest that both the DH domain and C-terminal 15-amino acid sequence of Tgat, but not the PH domain, are required for its transforming function.Tgat expression induced not only transforming activity but also invasion capability in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 5). Rho family proteins are known to be associated with changes in the membrane-linked cytoskeleton. Activation of Rac1, Cdc42, and RhoA has been shown to produce specific structural changes in the plasma membrane cytoskeleton associated with membrane ruffling, lamellipodia, filopodia, and stress fiber formation (35Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5185) Google Scholar). The coordinated activation of these Rho family proteins is thought to be a"

Expression of Ndr2 mRNA was detected in various cortical and subcortical brain regions, as well as non-neuronal tissues. Its expression in the amygdala was increased 6 h after Pavlovian fear conditioning training and returned to control levels within 24 h. To study intracellular localization and functions of Ndr2, EGFP::Ndr2 fusion proteins were expressed in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells and acutely isolated cortical neurons, thereby revealing an association of Ndr2 with the actin cytoskeleton in somata, neurites and filopodia, in spines and at sites of cell contact. Co-precipitation and pull-down experiments support this finding. Evidence for an involvement of Ndr2 in actin-mediated cellular functions further comes from the observation of decreased cell spreading and changes in neurite outgrowth that were associated with protein serine phosphorylation in transfected PC12 cells. Together, our data suggest that Ndr2 is an interesting candidate gene for the regulation of structural processes in differentiating and mature neuronal cells.

Together, our data suggest that Ndr2 is an interesting candidate gene for the regulation of structural processes in differentiating and mature neuronal cells. Stimulus-dependent modifications of cell structure and connectivity in the central nervous system are basic elements of long term memory formation. Protein kinases and protein phosphatases are key regulators of these processes, which they control and co-ordinate through the phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of neurotransmitter receptors and ion channels, cytoskeleton elements, cell surface molecules, and transcription factors (1Kandel E.R. Science. 2001; 294: 1030-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar).We have employed a classic fear conditioning paradigm to isolate candidate genes involved in memory-related functions in the brain (2Stork O. Stork S. Pape H.-C. Obata K. Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Fear conditioning is highly amenable to cellular and molecular approaches to learning and memory, because conditioned subjects (a) very quickly learn to associate a previously neutral sensory stimulus (conditional stimulus) and an aversive, unconditional stimulus during fear conditioning training and (b) develop a robust and easily measurable long term memory after a single training session. Moreover, the neuronal circuits and cellular mechanisms that underlie classic fear conditioning have been investigated in detail (reviewed in Ref. 3LeDoux J.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 155-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (6077) Google Scholar). These conceptual and technical advantages have allowed researchers to show that, among other factors, protein kinase A, mitogen-activated protein kinase and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases are critical for fear conditioning (summarized in Ref. 4Stork O. Pape H.-C. Cell Tissue Res. 2002; 310: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Some of these protein kinase activities could even be tracked down to the amygdala (5Schafe G.E. Atkins C.M.

Recent evidence further suggests an involvement of Rho-mediated signaling pathways and the Rho-associated kinase (p160ROCK) in amygdala plasticity after fear conditioning (8Lamprecht R. Farb C.R. LeDoux J.E. Neuron. 2002; 36: 727-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This pathway may be of particular importance, because it controls actin-mediated changes in dendrite and spine morphology, which are key elements of structural plasticity and memory consolidation (9Matus A.

The novel kinase belongs to the nuclear Dbf2-related (Ndr) 1The abbreviations used are: Ndr, nuclear Dbf2-related subfamily; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; NGF, nerve growth factor; CRE, cyclic AMP-responsive element.1The abbreviations used are: Ndr, nuclear Dbf2-related subfamily; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; MOPS, 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MBP, myelin basic protein; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; EGFP, enhanced GFP; NGF, nerve growth factor; CRE, cyclic AMP-responsive element. subfamily of serine/threonine kinases that control cell division and morphogenesis in various cell types, including neurons, and is distantly related to p160ROCK. Ndr2 has in parallel been identified through homology cloning (11Tamaskovic R. Bichsel S.J. Hemmings B.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 546: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and activation through S100B and Mob (Mps one binder) proteins with subsequent autophosphorylation has been described in two recent reports (12Stegert M.R.

In the current study we have begun to investigate possible neuronal functions of this kinase. To this end, we studied the expression of Ndr2 in the brain and its induction in various brain areas during consolidation of Pavlovian fear memory. We furthermore provide evidence for interaction of Ndr2 with the actin cytoskeleton and its involvement in neuronal growth and differentiation in cultured PC12 cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESA fragment of the 3′-untranslated region of the Ndr2 mRNA (clone #VIIE6) was identified through suppression subtractive hybridization of cDNA from the amygdala of fear-conditioned and control mice (Fig. 1A) und subsequent screening with cDNA blots (Fig. 1B). Experiments employed for the identification and expression analysis of clone #VIIE6 have been described previously (2Stork O. Stork S. Pape H.-C. Obata K. Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were performed in accordance with regulations through Japanese and German law and were approved by the Committee for Animal Research, Okazaki National Institutes (permission NRS A11-82-3 and A11-82-65) and the Regierungspräsidium Dessau (2-375 UNI MD).Cloning and Sequencing of Full-length Ndr2—Clone #VIIE6 was sequenced using the Thermo Sequenase cycle sequencing system (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, 1 μg of cDNA was amplified in the presence of fluorescence-labeled M13 forward or reverse primer oligonucleotide (Stratagene) and ddG, ddA, ddT, or ddC to terminate polymerization. Thirty cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 70 °C for 60 s were applied. Products were loaded onto a polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea, separated at 2000 V, and detected in a DNA sequencer (Model 4000L, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE). Based on the sequence information from clone #VIIE6, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was done using the SMART RACE system (BD Bioscience). To this end, total RNA was isolated from mouse brain using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen) and reverse-transcribed with Superscript II (Promega) in the presence of a modified oligo(dT) cDNA synthesis primer (for 3′-RACE) or oligo(dT) primer and SMART II oligonucleotide (for 5′-RACE). The 3′-end was amplified with a gene-specific primer oligonucleotide (5′-TCTGGAGATGTATGAAACCTGGGCTGTC-3′) and a universal primer mix (SMART RACE) in a touch down amplification procedure with 5 cycles of annealing for 10 s at 72 °C, 5 cycles at 70 °C, and 25 cycles of annealing at 68 °C, each preceded by denaturation for 5 s at 94 °C and followed by DNA polymerization for 3 min at 72 °C. For 5′-RACE, a gene-specific primer (5′-ATTCAAAGAGAGGATGTGCCAGGA-3′) was first used together with the universal primer mix for touch down amplification with 40 cycles in the final step. The product was diluted 1:50 and re-amplified with a nested gene-specific primer (5′-GGACAGCCCAGGTATCATACATCT-3′) and the nested universal primer (SMART RACE), using 29 cycles of 5 s at 94 °C, 10 s at 68 °C, and 3 min at 72 °C. RACE fragments were cloned into pGEM-Teasy and sequenced as described above. Sequences of three independent clones for each 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE were analyzed using Lasergene99 software (DNASTAR, Madison, WI) and NCBI and PROSITE databanks.Chromosomal Localization—Two primers were derived from the 3′-untranslated region (5′-CACAGCTAAGTCTGGAGATGTA-3′, representing bp 3781–3802, and 5′-ATGATCATAGCAAAACAGTTGC-3′, representing bp 4193–4172) and used for radiation hybrid mapping with a mouse/hamster radiation hybrid panel (Invitrogen). Thirty cycles of denaturation (15 s at 94 °C), primer annealing (30 s at 60 °C), and synthesis (30 s at 72 °C) were applied, as described previously (14Yoshikawa T. Sanders A.R. Esterling L.E. Overhauser J. Garnes J.A. Lennon G. Grewal R. Detera-Wadleigh S.D. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1997; 74: 140-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Northern Analysis—5 μg of total RNA was separated according to size with denaturing gel electrophoresis (in 20 mm MOPS, 5 mm sodium acetate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 m formaldehyde), transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N, Amersham Biosciences), and fixed under UV light. Ndr2 mRNA was visualized with Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes, generated through in vitro transcription from a vector containing either clone #VIIE6, the entire 5′-RACE product, or the coding region of the Ndr2 cDNA (Fig. 1A), all of which produced consistent results, and subsequent chemiluminescence detection as described above.Real-time PCR—Five 10-week-old male C57B/6J mice (M&B Taconic, Berlin, Germany) after extensive adaptation to the training apparatus (TSE Bad Homburg, Germany) were fear-conditioned with three conditional stimuli (10-kHz tone, 85 db for 10 s) that each co-terminated with an unconditional stimulus (0.6-mA foot shock, 1 s). Five pseudo-conditioned mice in parallel received explicitly unpaired presentation of these stimuli, and five controls each received three conditional stimuli, but no unconditional stimulus during training. Animals were returned to their home cages, and sacrificed 6 h later. Tissue samples from the basolateral complex of the amygdala, hippocampus, pre- and infralimbic (“prefrontal”) cortex, and the cerebellar cortex were punched from 100-μm-thick coronal sections of freshly frozen brains. Total RNA was isolated, and first strand synthesis was done with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of random decamer oligonucleotides (Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were analyzed with TaqMan real-time PCR in an AbiPrism 7000. Ndr2 assays designed to analyze the exon borders at mRNA position 1219 and 1328 were used in triplicate experiments and controlled with assays for phosphoglycerate kinase and 18 S rRNA (assay-on-demand, Applied Biosystems).In Situ Hybridization—Coronal and sagittal sections of 14-μm thickness were cut in a freezing microtome and thaw-mounted onto silane-coated slide glasses. Digoxigenin-labeled sense and antisense cRNA were generated from a clone containing the entire open reading frame of Ndr2 (Fig. 1A). In situ hybridization was performed with these probes as described previously (10Bonhoeffer T. Yuste R. Neuron. 2002; 35: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, after fixation in 4% para-formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), sections were acetylated, dehydrated, and pre-hybridized for 2 h at room temperature. After hybridization over night and washing at 55 °C with 0.2× standard sodium citrate buffer containing 50% formamide, labeled cells were detected with alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin antibody and subsequently stained using 4-nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate (all reagents from Roche Applied Science).Purification of Ndr2 Protein—Fusion proteins of Ndr2 and the maltose binding protein (MBP::Ndr2) were generated using the pMAL vector system (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The coding region of Ndr2 was amplified using primers 5′-ATGGCAATGACGGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-AGCACCCACTTCCTGTATTTC-3′ and cloned into vector pMAL-c2x. MBP::Ndr2 fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain ER2508, sonified in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.02% NaN3, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and pre-purified through chromatography on amylose columns (New England Biolabs). Ndr2 protein was then purified with affinity immuno-chromatography on Sepharose-coupled Ab420–430 (see below). Samples were loaded in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and eluted in 0.2 m glycine buffer, pH 2.8. The eluate was finally dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. For isolation of native Ndr2, brain samples were homogenized on ice with a 10-fold excess of 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3. After centrifugation at 300 × g to remove cell debris, the homogenate was applied to affinity chromatography with Sepharose-coupled Ab420–430, eluted, and dialyzed as describe above.Immunoblot Analysis—Polyclonal antibody Ab420–430 was generated against peptide LQPVPNTTEPD coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pineda Antibody Service, Berlin, Germany). Serum from an animal that detected both bacterially expressed and brain Ndr2 was selected and affinity-purified using the immunization peptide. Purified Ab420–430 was used at a dilution of 1:500–1:1000 in immunoblot analysis. Antibodies to β-actin, β-tubulin, α-actinin (Sigma), synapsin I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), phospho-serine (Qiagen), and neurofilament proteins (Biotrend Chemikalien, Köln, Germany) were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For immunoblot analysis, brain samples and cultured cells were homogenized in 1% SDS, 10 mm Tris-hydrochloride, pH 7.5, separated with electrophoresis on 8–10% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. After blocking of unspecific binding, blots were incubated with primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (DAKO, Copenhagen Denmark) before visualization with “ECL-plus” substrate (Amersham Biosciences). Ab420–430 detected native Ndr2 protein from the brain and MBP::Ndr2 fusion protein from bacteria at the predicted molecular masses of 54 and 96 kDa, respectively (Fig. 4A). The specificity of signals for Ndr2 and phospho-serine was confirmed through preincubation of primary antibodies with excess peptide LQPVPNTTEPD or MBP::Ndr2 fusion protein, or with o-phospho-l-serine, respectively.Fig. 4Ndr2 protein and precipitation of actin. (A) Ndr2 was detected in 100 μg of total brain homogenate using Ab420–430. In addition to a signal at the predicted molecular mass of 54kD, background staining of several high and low molecular weight proteins was seen in all SDS-PAGE preparations. The lanes on the right show purified Ndr2 protein from the brain and bacterial MBP::Ndr2 fusion protein. (B) Pull down assays with MBP::Ndr2 fusion proteins precipitated β-actin from brain protein extracts. Only traces of β-actin were seen in MBP precipitates or after omission of amylose. In contrast, we entirely failed to detect β-tubulin or neurofilament proteins in MBP::Ndr2 precipitates. For both, crude brain protein extracts served as positive controls. NF-L, neurofilament light chain. C, β-actin was also co-precipitated with Ndr2 through Ab420–430, whereas only background actin labeling was observed when the primary antibody was omitted. Analysis of precipitates with phospho-serine antibodies further suggests that a considerable proportion of the precipitated β-actin was phosphorylated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Co-precipitation and Pull-down Assays—Protein samples for precipitation experiments were obtained from total brains, homogenized in 10-fold excess of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 137 mm NaCl, 2.8 mm KCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.02% NaN3, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× Proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), or PC12 cells, homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% IGEPAL CA-630, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Protease inhibitor mixture. For MBP::Ndr2 pull-down assays, 100 μg of the soluble protein fraction after centrifugation at 15,000 × g and clearing with amylose resin (New England Biolabs) were incubated with 2 μgof MBP::Ndr2 or 2 μg of MBP2 (New England Biolabs) for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation for 90 min with amylose resin, MBP-amylose complexes were precipitated by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. For co-precipitation, protein samples were cleared with Sepharose-protein A/G (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with 5 μg of antibodies against actin or Ndr2 for 1 h at 4 °C. Complexes were precipitated with Sepharose-protein A/G at 4 °C for 1 h, centrifuged at 12,000 × g, then finally washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and subsequently with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Proteins precipitated in these ways were examined with SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis.Immunohistochemistry—For immunohistochemical detection of Ndr2, freshly frozen coronal and sagittal sections of 14-μm thickness were used. Sections were fixed in 4% para-formaldehyde in PBS and washed in PBS, before unspecific binding was blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin, 10% rabbit normal serum, and 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 h. Ndr2 was detected with affinity-purified Ab420–430 at a dilution of 1:300 to 1:500 in 3% bovine serum albumin, 2% rabbit normal serum, and PBS overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, labeling was visualized with fluorescence-labeled secondary antibodies (DAKO).PC12 cells and primary neurons were fixed in increasing concentrations (0.4–4%) of para-formaldehyde, washed in PBS, and mounted in Crystal/mount (Biomeda, Foster City, CA). In some experiments, EGFP signals were enhanced with Ab6556 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), which was applied at a dilution of 1:500–1:1000 in 2% bovine serum albumin, 2% goat normal serum in PBS. Signal specificity was fully confirmed using Ab420–430. Counter staining was routinely done with 0.05% rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) or with antibodies to α-actinin or synapsin I at a dilution of 1:500. Cells were examined on an epifluorescence microscope with digital image capturing (AxioVision 4, Zeiss).Expression Systems and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Fusion proteins of Ndr2 and the enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were generated using vector pEGFP-c1 (BD Biosciences) and the amplified Ndr2 coding region (see MBP::Ndr2 fusion). Ser282-Ala/Thr442-Ala double mutants of EGFP::Ndr2 were generated using a site-directed mutagenesis system (QuikChange, Stratagene), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers 5′-GGAGACAGCTGGCTTAC (T → G) CCACAG TTGGAACACCAGAC-3′ (for Ser282) and 5′-GACTGGGTTTTTCTCAATTAC (A → G) CCTACAAAAGGTTTGAAGGG-3′ (for Thr442) and the corresponding reverse primers were used to introduce the indicated point mutations, which were subsequently combined using an inbetween AccI restriction site.Cell Culture PC12—Rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were cultured in 85% RPMI 1640 with 2 mm l-glutamine, 10% horse serum, and 5% fetal bovine serum (all reagents from Invitrogen, Eggenstein, Germany). Transfections with plasmids expressing native EGFP::Ndr2, mutant EGFP::Ndr2, or EGFP were performed using the GeneJammer reagent (Stratagene). Stable transfected cells were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and maintained under 200–400 μg/ml of G418 during neurite outgrowth experiments. For assessment of neurite outgrowth and intracellular localization of Ndr2, acute and stable cells were allowed to adhere to poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured in 97% RPMI 1640 with 2 mm l-glutamine, 2% horse serum, and 1% fetal bovine serum. A putative association of EGFP::Ndr2 with the actin cytoskeleton or microtubules was addressed through treatment of stably transfected cells for 3 h with 10 μm latrunculin B (Molecular Probes) or 100 μm colchicine (Sigma), respectively. PC12 neurite outgrowth was determined with and without supplementation of nerve growth factor (NGF, 50 ng/ml, New England Biolabs) for up to 5 days. The proportion of transfected cells producing neurites of >10 μm was determined at different time points after seeding. For a detailed analysis of neurite extension and branching, 5% of transfected cells with the largest neurites in each sample were reconstructed (Neurolucida, Microbrightfield, Magdeburg, Germany) and compared between groups. In addition, phospho-serine immunoblot analyses were performed in early outgrowing cultures. Each 2 × 105 cells per line were collected during the first day of neurite outgrowth culture and treated with a boiling buffer containing 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min. Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE and analyzed in immunoblots with antibodies directed against phosphoserine and β-actin. Statistical comparisons were done with Student's unpaired t test and the Mann-Whitney U test.Cell Culture of Primary Neurons—Primary cortical neurons were obtained from day 19 embryonic Long Evans rats (modified from Ref. 15Goslin K. Asmussen H. Banker G. Banker G. Goslin K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 339-370Google Scholar). In brief, after treatment with 0.5% trypsin in Hanks' buffered salt solution (Invitrogen) and 0.01% of DNase I, cells were dissociated mechanically using a Nylon mesh (aperture, 125 μm) and suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen). 40,000 cells each were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and grown for 14 days before transfection with 2 μg of plasmid DNA in 72.5 μl of a buffer containing 42 mm Hepes, 74 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.4 mm Na2HPO4, 15 mm glucose, and 125 mm CaCl2 together with 10 μl of Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen) and 2.5 μl of NeuroPORTER (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA) at pH 7.05. Cultures were examined with an epifluorescence microscope 48 h after transfection.RESULTSIsolation and Differential Expression of Ndr2—The 200-bp clone #VIIE6 (Fig. 1A) was selected from a group of 21 gene products that were differentially expressed in the amygdala during consolidation of fear memory (2Stork O. Stork S. Pape H.-C. Obata K. Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As the first step in our analysis, the induction of Ndr2 expression was confirmed with PCR-based Northern analysis on amygdala samples pooled from each group of four animals (2Stork O. Stork S. Pape H.-C. Obata K. Learn. Mem. 2001; 8: 209-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). A double band at 3.0/2.8 kb could be detected with probe #VIIE6 and later with probes generated from the 5′-RACE product. Overexposure of blots revealed an additional hybridization signal at ∼4.5 kb (data not shown), which corresponds to the length of the sequenced Ndr2 (Stk38l) mRNA and the size of Ndr2 detected on standard Northern blots (Fig. 1C). Quantitative analysis of Ndr2 transcript levels at the major double band revealed an increase in fear-conditioned animals 6 h after training (181.4 ± 24.2% of control levels, p < 0.05, Student's t test, n = 4 independent behavioral experiments). A similar increase was also observed for the 4.5-kb signal, although reliable quantification was not possible in the overexposed blots. The pseudo-conditioned group showed a partial increase of expression (139.9 ± 10.9% of control levels, p < 0.05). At a later time point, 24 h after training, no difference of Ndr2 expression could be observed in either experimental group compared with the unconditioned control animals (fear-conditioned: 106 ± 27.8%, pseudo-conditioned: 108 ± 20.9% of control levels; n = 3).Differential expression of Ndr2 after fear conditioning was confirmed on individual animals in an independent behavioral experiment (Fig. 1D). The analysis with real-time PCR of Ndr2 expression levels in four different brain areas showed specific increases in the basolateral complex of the amygdala for both fear-conditioned (245.4 ± 125.6% of control levels, p < 0.05, n = 5) and pseudo-conditioned mice (710.0 ± 307.1% of control levels, p < 0.01, n = 5). Moderate increases were also observed in frontal cortical samples (fear-conditioned mice: 209.9 ± 114.3% of control levels) and in the hippocampus of pseudo-conditioned animals (194.4 ± 93.4% of control levels). These, however, failed to reach significance level. No difference was observed between groups in the cerebellar cortex (fear-conditioned, 116.4 ± 43.2%; pseudo-conditioned, 91.4 ± 27.1%).Sequence of Ndr2—With 3′-RACE and 5′-RACE we isolated 4557 bp of Ndr2 (Stk38l) mRNA that cover the entire coding sequence and 3′-untranslated region (sequence information was deposited with GenBank™ accession number AY223819). Clone #VIIE6 of the subtracted library located to bp 3742–3941 of this sequence (Fig. 1A). A Kozak consensus sequence and translation start was found in the 5′-RACE product, followed by an open reading frame of 1368 bp. The coding region and following 900-bp are identical to the recently identified mNdr2 clone (AY292400 (12Stegert M.R. Tamaskovic T. Bichsel S.J. Hergovich A. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23806-23812Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar)). However, 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of these sequences differ in that we isolated a 40-bp 5′ region that was not found in the clone described by Stegert and co-workers, and an additional 2.3-kb 3′-untranslated region following the first putative polyadenylation signal. Northern analysis and a vast majority of expressed sequence tag hits in GenBank™ indicate that our clone resembles the predominantly expressed Ndr2 transcript.Gene Location and Gene Structure—Radiation hybrid mapping and GenBank™ analysis located the Ndr2 gene to mouse chromosome 6, 9.65 centi Ray from D6Mit294 (logarithm of odds score > 3.0). This could be confirmed by an NCBI GenBank™ search that further suggested that human NDR2 locates to chromosome 12 p11. The mouse gene comprises 14 exons, which span a total of 54 kb, with a first intron of 33 kb in length. In the putative promoter region, two SP1 elements could be identified at positions –155 and –10, a serum-responsive element at position –30, and a cyclic AMP-responsive element (CRE) consensus site at position –89 toward a twin GC box. Various potential polyadenylation sites were identified between positions 2256 and 4517, but Northern blot analysis illustrated the preferential expression of an Ndr2 mRNA species with a length of 4.5 kb in various tissues (see Fig. 1C). The smaller size of fragments in PCR-blot analysis thus is likely a result of premature incorporation of the 5′-oligonucleotide and preferential amplification of small PCR products.Ndr2 Expression in the Brain—In situ hybridization revealed a widespread expression of Ndr2 at moderate levels throughout the brain (Fig. 2). The highest staining intensity was observed in the neocortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus (particularly area CA3), the amygdala, cerebellum, and several brainstem nuclei. The results were corroborated by immunohistochemical staining using Ab420–430, which was abolished after preincubation of antibodies with immunization peptide or bacterially exp"
https://openalex.org/W1969899671,"Processing of the nf-κb2 gene product p100 to generate p52 is a tightly regulated event, consistent with the fact that the processing product, p52, is hardly detected in most cell types, including T cells, although the precursor p100 is expressed abundantly in these cells. However, in T cells transformed by the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I), p100 processing is very active, resulting in high level expression of p52. Because overproduction of p52 is associated with lymphoid hyperplasia and transformation, deregulation of p100 processing may be part of the oncogenic mechanism of HTLV-I. We demonstrated previously that HTLV-I Tax oncoprotein is a potent inducer of p100 processing through specific targeting of IKKα via IKKγ to p100 to trigger p100 phosphorylation and ubiquitination. In this study, we further show that Tax-mediated recruitment of IKKα to p100 requires serines 866 and 870 of p100, shown to be essential for inducible processing of p100. Upon interaction with p100, activated IKKα phosphorylates both N- and C-terminal serines of p100 (serines 99, 108, 115, 123 and 872), serving as a critical step in Tax-induced p100 processing. Using a genetic approach, we find that β-transducin repeat-containing protein, a component of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex, previously shown to be required for physiological p100 processing mediated by nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase, is only partially involved in Tax-induced processing of p100. These results indicate that both β-transducin repeat-containing protein-dependent and -independent mechanisms contribute to Tax-deregulated p100 processing, further suggesting the involvement of different mechanisms in cellular and viral pathways of p100 processing.

Tax protein involves activation of cAMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor and NF-κB, two major cellular transcription factors (1Smith M.R. Greene W.C. J. Clin. Investig. 1991; 87: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 2Zhao L.J. Giam C.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7070-7074Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Tax activates transcription activity of cAMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor proteins by directly interacting with their basic region-leucine zipper DNA-binding domains, thereby enhancing DNA binding (3Wagner S. Green M.R. Science. 1993; 262: 395-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 4Baranger A.M. Palmer C.R. Hamm M.K. Giebler H.A. Brauweiler A. Nyborg J.K. Schepartz A. Nature. 1995; 376: 606-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 5Perini G. Wagner S. Green M.R. Nature. 1995; 376: 602-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Unlike cAMP response element-binding protein/activating transcription factor, which is constitutively expressed in nucleus, NF-κB is normally sequestered in the cytoplasm by ankyrin repeat-containing inhibitors called IκB proteins (6Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5615) Google Scholar). The nuclear expression of NF-κB can be induced by various cellular stimuli, such as T-cell mitogens, proinflammatory cytokines, and antigens. These stimuli trigger an IκB kinase (IKK) complex, which consists of IKKα, IKKβ (two catalytic subunits), and IKKγ (regulatory subunit, also named NEMO), to phosphorylate specific serines within the IκB sequence. The phosphorylated IκB is then targeted for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation, allowing the NF-κB to accumulate in the nucleus and transactivate target genes (7Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions, this classic NF-κB activation is tightly controlled and usually transient (6Baldwin A.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (5615) Google Scholar, 7Ghosh S. Karin M. Cell. 2002; 109: S81-S96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3309) Google Scholar). However, in Tax-expressing cells, IKK is persistently activated, resulting in constitutive nuclear expression and transcription activity of NF-κB. Tax induces activation of IKK complex by directly interacting with the regulatory subunit IKKγ (8Chu Z.L. Shin Y.A. Yang J.M. DiDonato JA Ballard D.W. J. Biol.

In mammalian cells, there are five NF-κB members: RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50, and p52, which function as various homo- and heterodimers (13Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar). Unlike the Rel proteins, p50 and p52 are synthesized as large precursors NF-κB1 p105 and NF-κB2 p100, respectively (13Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2020) Google Scholar, 14Fan C.M. Maniatis T. Nature. 1991; 354: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15Betts J.C. Nabel G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6363-6371Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting that p105 and p100 also contain ankyrin repeats at their C-terminal regions and function as IκB-like inhibitors of NF-κB (16Rice N.R. MacKichan ML Israel A. Cell. 1992; 71: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 17Mercurio F. DiDonato JA Rosette C. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 705-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Different from the complete degradation of other IκB proteins, the proteasome-mediated degradation of p105 and p100 leads only to loss of their C-terminal ankyrin repeat regions, leaving intact N termini, p50, and p52, respectively (18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4124) Google Scholar, 19Silverman N. Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2321-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Thus, the processing of p105 and p100 not only plays a role in liberating specific NF-κB complexes but also serves to generate p50 and p52. Although p105 processing is constitutive, the processing of p100 is tightly regulated through its inducible phosphorylation and polyubiquitination (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Induction of p100 phosphorylation and subsequent processing is mediated by NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and its downstream kinase IKKα (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 21Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M.

It is interesting that neither IKKβ nor IKKγ is required for this novel, “non-canonical” NF-κB pathway, although both IKKβ and IKKγ are essential for canonical NF-κB activation (21Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar, 22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A.

Therefore, the NIK/IKKα-specific NF-κB pathway can not be stimulated by most of the classic NF-κB inducers; rather, it responds to signals involved in B cell differentiation and lymphoid organogenesis, including those triggered by lymphotoxin β (20Xiao G.

Those stimuli serve as physiological stimulators of NIK to induce processing of p100. Not surprisingly, proper processing of p100 plays an essential role in the development and maturation of lymphoid organs. For example, nfκb2 gene-deficient mice with no expression of both p100 and p52 show severe defects in B cell function and impairment in the formation of the proper architecture of peripheral lymphoid organs (27Caamano J.H.

On the other hand, mice whose nfκb2 gene was engineered to contain a mutation that prevents expression of the p100 C terminus leading to constitutive p52 expression but no p100 production, develop lymphoid and gastric hyperplasia (34Ishikawa H. Carrasco D. Claudio E. Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 999-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In humans, chromosomal translocations that cause the rearranged nfκb2 gene to lose its C-terminal processing inhibitory domain, leading to constitutive processing of p100 (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar), are associated with the development of various lymphomas (35Fracchiolla N.S. Lombardi L.

In addition, those constitutively processed forms of p100 have been reported to oncogenically transform fibroblasts in vitro (38Ciana P. Neri A. Cappellini C. Cavallo F. Pomati M. Chang C.-C. Maiolo A.T. Lombardi L. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1805-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is interesting that deregulated p100 processing is also found to be associated with T-cell transformation by HTLV-I, an etiological agent of an acute and fatal T-cell malignancy, adult T cell leukemia (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Because p100 processing is inefficient in T cells, including activated T cells (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), overproduction of p52 in T cells is a hallmark of HTLV-I infection and transformation (39Lanoix J. Lacoste J. Pepin N. Rice N. Hiscott J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 841-852PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that stable expression of p100 could efficiently block HTLV-I Tax-mediated transformation (40Yamaoka S. Inoue H. Sakurai M. Sugiyama T. Hazama M. Yamada T. Hatanaka M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 873-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), through specific inhibition of the function of the alternative NF-κB pathway activated by HTLV-I (41Solan N.J. Miyoshi H. Carmona E.M. Bren G.D. Paya C.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1405-1418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Thus, a fundamental understanding of p100 processing will not only provide important insights into the development of both human immune system and NF-κB-associated diseases but may also suggest effective therapeutic strategies for HTLV-I-induced adult T cell leukemia and other p100 processing associated diseases (42Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 43Cogswell P.C. Guttridge D.C. Funkhouser W.K. Baldwin Jr., A.S.

Our previous studies have demonstrated that Tax functions as a potent inducer of p100 processing (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Unlike physiological p100 processing, which involves NIK and IKKα, but not IKKγ (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 21Senftleben U. Cao Y. Xiao G. Greten F.R. Krahn G. Bonizzi G. Chen Y. Hu Y. Fong A. Sun S.C. Karin M. Science. 2001; 293: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar), Tax induces p100 processing by specifically targeting IKKα indirectly via IKKγ into p100-containing complexes, triggering p100 ubiquitination and subsequent processing (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). We have recently discovered that NIK-mediated processing of p100 also involves recruitment of IKKα to p100. It is interesting that purified IKKα could phosphorylate serines located in both N- and C-terminal regions of p100, which are involved in NIK-mediated processing of p100 (45Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have demonstrated that Tax recruitment of IKKα to p100 requires serines 866 and 870 of p100, which have been shown to be essential for inducible processing of p100. Tax-activated IKKα also consistently phosphorylates both N- and C-terminal serines of p100, a step required for the binding of p100 to β-TrCP E3 ligase and Tax-induced p100 processing. However, we also find that β-TrCP is only partially responsible for Tax-induced processing of p100, although NIK-mediated p100 processing depends on β-TrCP. Expression Vectors and Antibodies—Expression vectors encoding p100 and its serine mutants p100 S866A/S870A and p100 S866A/S870A/S872A (labeled p100 SS/AA and p100 SSS/AAA, respectively), Tax, HA-tagged NIK, IKKα and its mutants, βTrCP and its siRNA-resistant form, and ubiquitin have been described previously (20Xiao G.

Other p100 serine mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pCMV4 p100 as template with the use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). p100 S99A, p100 S108A, p100 S115A, p100 S123A, and p100 S872A harbor serine-to-alanine substitutions at residues 99, 108, 115, 123, and 872, respectively. p100 4S/A and p100 5S/A mutants were obtained by substituting four serines (Ser-99, -108, -115 and -123) or five serines (Ser-99, -108, -115, -123, and -872) with alanines, respectively (45Xiao G. Fong A. Sun S.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 30099-30105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). GST-p100C and GST-p100C SSS/AAA were generated previously (22Xiao G.

GST-p100 N-terminal mutant and its serine mutants were created by similar strategies. The anti-HA monoclonal antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (anti-HA-HRP, 3F10) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The antibodies recognizing the N terminus of p100 (anti-p100N) and Tax were kindly provided by Dr. W. C. Greene (48Smith M.R. Greene W.C.

Cell Culture and Transfection—The kidney carcinoma cell line, 293, was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and antibiotics. 293 cells (1 × 105, seeded in a 6-well plate) were transfected with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting (IB) and Co-Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP)—293 cells were transfected with the expression vectors as indicated in the figures and lysed in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfony fluoride) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture, followed by IB or Co-IP assays as described previously (20Xiao G.

Cell Labeling and Pulse-chase Assays—Transfected 293 cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine and cysteine, followed by metabolic labeling for 45 min with 350 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine. The pulse-labeled cells were chased for different times in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm unlabeled methionine and lysed in RIPA buffer. The radiolabeled, myc-tagged, wild-type p52 or its mutant was isolated by IP using anti-myc antibody, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (11Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34060-34067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 12Xiao G. Sun S.C. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5198-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Cell extracts from HTLV-I-transformed cells or control Jurkat T cells were incubated at 30 °C for 20 min in a kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing [γ-32P]dATP and labeled substrates. The phosphorylated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and visualized by autoradiography. The membrane was subsequently used for IB to analyze the protein level of substrates. In Vivo Ubiquitin Conjugation Assays—293 cells were transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin and p100 or its mutants in the presence or absence of Tax. 36–48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) using anti-p100. Agarose beads were washed three times with RIPA buffer followed by two additional washes with RIPA buffer supplemented with 1 m urea. The ubiquitin-conjugated p10 eluted by SDS loading buffer was analyzed by IB using anti-HA-HRP (20Xiao G. Harhaj E.W. Sun S.-C. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 401-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar, 22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). SiRNA-mediated Gene Silencing—The sequences of double-stranded siRNA are: for β-TrCP, GUG GAA UUU GUG GAA CAU CTT (sense) and GAU GUU CCA AUU CCA CTT (antisense), and for green fluorescent protein, GCU ACC UGU UCC AUG GCC ATT (sense) and UGG CCA UGG AAC AGG UAG CTT (antisense). These siRNAs were synthesized by Dharmacon Research, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). 293 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 293 cells were transfected in 6-well plates with 60 pmol of siRNA mixed with 800 ng of carrier DNA (pCMV4 vector). Transfection was repeated 24 h later to achieve high efficiency of siRNA transfection, except that the indicated DNA expression vectors were used in place of carrier DNA. Twenty-four hours after the second transfection, whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting or to in vivo ubiquitin conjugation assays. Tax Recruitment of IKKα into p100 Complexes Is Independent of the Kinase Activity of IKKα—As we reported previously, Tax could specifically target IKKα, but not IKKβ, into p100 complexes (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To further test whether the kinase activity of IKKα or its active status is required for p100/IKKα association, both kinase constitutively active (IKKα SS/EE) and inactive (IKKα SS/AA or IKKα KA) forms of IKKα were used. As shown in Fig. 1, these IKKα mutants only weakly bound to p100 (top, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), which is consistent with their inability to induce p100 processing (bottom, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). However, these IKKα mutants, like wild-type IKKα, could efficiently interact with p100 when Tax was coexpressed (top, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). These results indicated that the kinase activity of IKKα is not involved in its recruitment to p100 by Tax. The fact that the constitutively active form of IKKα (IKKα SS/EE) also failed to efficiently bind to p100 without Tax expression and did not induce p100 processing suggested that activation of IKKα is not sufficient, although required, for inducible processing of p100. Co-expression of the kinase-inactive forms of IKKα partially decreased Tax-induced p100 processing in a consistent fashion (bottom, lanes 6 and 8), whereas the constitutively active form marginally increased this ability of Tax (lane 4). These results are also in agreement with the fact that the expression level of endogenous IKKα is relatively high in 293 cells. Deletion of the N-terminal Region of p100 Results in Constitutive p100/IKKα Interaction and Inducible p100 Degradation—To further define the “docking” site within p100 for IKKα interaction, we performed Co-IP assays using a series of systematic p100 N- and C-terminal deletion mutants (Fig 2A). In agreement with our previous report showing that Tax associates with p100 via two N-terminal α-helices of p100 (located between amino acids 151 and 180) (22Xiao G. Civijic M.E. Fong A. Harhaj E.W. Uhlik M.T. Waterfield M. Sun S.-C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6805-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar), deletion of up to 124 amino acids from the p100 N terminus (p100 Δ1–32, p100 Δ1–71, p100 Δ1–124) did not affect p100/Tax interaction (Fig 2B, second panel from top, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). IKKα could still be recruited consistently to these p100 deletion mutants (top, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Further deletion of 59 amino acids or more from this end (p100 Δ1–183, p100 Δ1–343) prevented p100/Tax interaction (second panel, lanes 10 and 12). It was interesting, however, that these two deletion mutants showed constitutive IKKα binding activities, as reflected by the fact that these p100 truncation mutants could directly interact with IKKα without Tax (top, lanes 9 and 11). On the other hand, co-expression of Tax actually slightly reduced the binding between IKKα and these two mutants of p100 (top, compare lanes 9 and 11 with lanes 10 and 12, respectively). The decreased interaction could be caused by the competition of the p100 mutants and Tax for IKKα. These results indicated that the N-terminal sequences of p100 are not involved in Tax-induced IKKα binding of p100, but rather inhibit the constitutive activity of p100 in binding to IKKα. These studies further suggested that the IKKα binding site of p100 is located in its C terminus. Although p100 Δ1–32 and p100 Δ1–71 still responded to Tax-induced p100 processing (Fig. 2B, bottom, lanes 4 and 6), the p100 Δ1–124 mutant was largely resistant to Tax-induced processing (lane 8), although it still retained the ability to bind to Tax and to recruit IKKα mediated by Tax (top and second panel, lane 8). It is noteworthy that Tax could still induce marginal processing of the p100 Δ1–124 mutant (Fig. 2C, lane 4), suggesting that other sequences besides amino acid 1–124 of p100 might contribute to th"

DSP and DPP are specific markers for terminally differentiated odontoblasts and are encoded by a single gene DSPP (dentin sialophosphoprotein). In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms required for tissue-specific expression of the DSPP gene, we have identified a novel interaction between two bZIP transcription factors, Nrf1 and the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β. This interaction was confirmed by both immunoprecipitation and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. In undifferentiated odontoblasts, Nrf1 and C/EBPβ repress DSPP promoter activity individually and synergistically by cooperatively interacting with each other. This mutual interaction is facilitated by the bZIP domains in both the proteins. The repression domain in both Nrf1 and C/EBPβ was determined, and deletion of this domain abolished transcriptional repression. In fully differentiated odontoblasts, the loss of interaction between Nrf1 and C/EBPβ results in an increased DSPP transcription. Further, this interaction was found to be dependent on phosphorylation at Ser599 of Nrf1. Thus, the physical interaction between Nrf1 and C/EBPβ provide a novel mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of DSPP in odontoblasts.

Thus, the physical interaction between Nrf1 and C/EBPβ provide a novel mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of DSPP in odontoblasts. Odontogenesis is regulated by several molecular determinants that are expressed in a temporal and spatial manner. Various signaling pathways trigger the induction of different transcription factors and DNA-binding proteins onto specific DNA regulatory regions facilitating transcriptional activation of odontoblast-specific genes that are required for dentin mineralization. The major proteins synthesized by fully differentiated odontoblasts are type I collagen and two major noncollagenous proteins (NCPs), namely dentin phosphophoryn (DPP) 1The abbreviations used are: DPP, dentin phosphophoryn; DSP, dentin sialoprotein; DSPP, dentin sialophosphoprotein; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; C/EBP, CCAAT enhancer-binding protein; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; HA, hemagglutinin. and dentin sialoprotein (DSP) (1Veis A. Butler W.T. Chemistry and Biology of Mineralized Tissues. EBSCO Media, Birmingham, AL1985: 170-184Google Scholar). DSP and DPP are specific markers for terminally differentiated odontoblasts and are encoded by a single gene DSPP located on mouse chromosome 5 (2George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakura S.R. Liu K. Veis A.

Cell Genet. 1997; 79: 121-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Published reports have established that the DSPP gene encodes for a single transcript containing DSP at the 5′-end and DPP at the 3′-end of the transcript. Various reports have suggested that the holoprotein might be cleaved by specific enzymes into DSP and DPP (5Butler W.T. Brunn J.C. Qin C. McKee M.D. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 301-307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the compound protein DSPP has not been isolated yet as a complete entity. Mutations in the DSPP gene have been identified to be associated with the inherited genetic disorder, dentinogenesis imperfecta types I and II (6Xiao S. Yu C. Chou X. Yuan W. Wang Y. Bu L. Fu G.

Recently, a single mutation in the signal peptide of the DSP protein was responsible for the genetic disorder dentine dysplasia type II (8Rajpar M.H. Koch M.J. Davies R.M. Mellody K.T. Kielty C.M. Dixon M.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2559-2565Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Further, the DSPP knock-out mice exhibits dentinogenesis imperfecta type III phenotype. Thus DSPP is a key molecule for normal dentinogenesis (9Sreenath T. Thyagarajan T. Hall B. Longenecker G. D'Souza R. Hong S. Wright J.T. MacDougall M. Sauk J. Kulkarni A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24874-24878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). To determine the transcriptional regulation of DSPP gene we have cloned and characterized the rat DSPP promoter and identified a repression domain between –700 and –400 bp. Further analysis of this region identified two binding elements, which have 90% homology to the DNA binding sites for two bZIP transcription factors Nrf1 and the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β. The bZIP transcription factors constitute an important class of eukaryotic DNA-binding protein in which dimerization is mediated through their coiled-coil regions. In an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms behind the tissue-specific expression of DSPP gene, we have utilized the promoter sequence of DSPP and analyzed the direct function of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ on DSPP transcription. Nrf1, also known as TCF11/LCR-F1 belong to the common CNC (cap′n′ collar) family (10Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolstø A.B. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and plays an important role during development (11Farmer S.C. Sun C.W. Winnier G.E. Hogan B.L. Townes T.M.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1779-1787Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Even though Nrf1 is related to the hematopoietic specific transcription factor, p45NF-E2, it was shown to be different. However, it can bind to the same recognition sequence as that of p45NF-E2, either as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with other bZIP proteins like small Maf transcription factors (13Moi P. Chan K.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4289-4297Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The specificity of Nrf1 in transcriptional regulation relies on post-translational modifications and its interaction with other co-factors. Nrf1 can modulate the antioxidant response element of stress related genes by cooperatively interacting with transcription factors such as AP1 proteins (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) (16Venugopal R. Jaiswal A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14960-14965Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Under normal conditions Nrf1 exists as a complex with Keap1 (inhibitor) and during stress Nrf1 dissociates from Keap1 and becomes active (17Itoh K. Wakabayashi N. Katoh Y. Ishii T. Igarashi K. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 76-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (2830) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Nrf1 was also shown to regulate the expression of TNFα by interacting with AP1 factors (c-Jun, JunD, and FosB) (18Novotny V. Prieschl E.E. Csonga R. Fabjani G. Baumruker T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5480-5485Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of Nrf1 has identified a DNA binding domain and a transactivation domain. Complex interactions of these domains with other co-factors resulted in activity of specific cell types (19Husberg C. Murphy P. Martin E. Kolstø A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17641-17652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Recently functional NLS and NES domains within the Nrf1 protein responsible for nucleocytoplasmic shuttling have been identified (20Husberg C. Murphy P. Bjorgo E. Kalland K.H. Kolstø A.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1640: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, the direct function of Nrf1 with respect to transcriptional regulation of extracellular matrix genes has not yet been reported. C/EBPs are a group of basic leucine zipper transcription factors identified by their sequence-specific binding to the CCAAT motifs in DNA. There are six different C/EBP family members that have been cloned and characterized (reviewed in Refs. 21Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar and 22Ramji D.P. Foka P. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 561-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All members share homology at the bZIP domain and are multifunctional proteins that exhibit a diverse set of cellular responses like differentiation, inflammatory response, liver regeneration, metabolism etc (23Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). The target genes of the C/EBP family members are diverse and various studies have shown that C/EBP can modulate the expression of various matrix genes critical for osteoblast differentiation such as pro-α1 and -α2 type I collagen, matrix Gla protein, and osteocalcin. In most cases C/EBPβ can form a homodimer and bind to its recognition sequence; however C/EBPβ can also intraheterodimerize with other members of the family (23Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar) as well as with a variety of bZIP proteins such as CREB (24Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), C/ATF (25Vallejo M. Ron D. Miller C.P. Habener J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4679-4683Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and AP1 (26Hsu W. Kerppola T.K. Chen P.-L. Curran T. Chen-Kiang S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 268-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ has two major isoforms, liver-enriched activator protein (LAP), which is normally reported to be an activator and liver-enriched inhibitory protein (LIP), which lacks most of the trans -activation domain of LAP and thus acts as a dominant-negative inhibitor. Thus, C/EBPβ can directly activate or inhibit target gene expression. Odontoblast-specific gene transcriptions are regulated by highly sophisticated synergistic interactions between transcription factors binding to specific regulatory sequences, with the basal transcriptional machinery. Both positive and negative regulatory mechanisms are required for transcriptional regulation of dentin matrix genes resulting in normal dentin formation. In this study we provide compelling evidence for the transcriptional repression of DSPP by association of C/EBPβ with Nrf1. The physical interaction between C/EBPβ and Nrf1 was both direct and physiologically relevant. This functional interaction was mediated through the bZIP domain. The efficiency of this interaction was found to be dependent on phosphorylation of Nrf1 at Ser599 by PKA. Further, a transcriptional repression domain has been mapped to the C terminus of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ, which is required for the transcriptional regulation of DSPP. Plasmid Constructs—A 1.7-kb fragment was amplified from rat genomic DNA to obtain the DSPP promoter. The promoter was sequence-verified and subcloned into pGL3basic (Promega) vector at NheI and SmaI. Nrf1 expression plasmid was a kind gift from Dr. Kolstø (27Luna L. Skammelsrud N. Johnsen È. Abel K.J. Weber B.L. Prydz H. Kolstø A-B. Genomics. 1995; 27: 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The Nrf1 cDNA was further subcloned into the HA tag vector. C/EBP plasmids (α, β, γ, and δ) were kind gifts from Dr. Friedman (Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine). DSPP promoter deletions were made using specific primers. Deletions constructs of C/EBPβ and Nrf1 were carried out by PCR with gene-specific primers containing EcoRI/EcoRV sites. The products were sequence-verified and cloned into CMV-3XFLAG tag vector (Sigma) for transfection assays. The repressor domain deletion was carried out by inserting a SalI site for C/EBPβ and SacI site for Nrf1. Glutathione S-transferase fusion protein constructs were made by cloning the PCR products generated with EcoRI and EcoRV sites and inserted into EcoRI and SmaI sites in PGEX4T-3 vector. The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli, BL21 (Invitrogen) according to the suggested protocol from the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Culture and Transfections—An odontoblast cell line developed by hTERT-mediated immortalization as reported earlier (28Hao J. Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. He G. Almushayt A. Evans C. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19976-19981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used in this study. The odontoblast cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1% amphotericin B. MC3T3-E1 cells were cultured as described earlier (29Narayanan K. Srinivas R. Ramachandran A. Hao J. Quinn B. George A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 4516-4521Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Transient transfections with reporter plasmids were performed with Superfect (Qiagen) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Reporter transfections were carried out in triplicate and repeated thrice to obtain a mean value. All transfections contained an internal control vector pRL-SV40, which contains a Renilla luciferase gene driven by the SV40 promoter. Double transfections were made with equimolar concentrations of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ expression plasmids. Luciferase Assay—The dual luciferase assay system was used in all experiments and was purchased from Promega and used in an automated luminometer from Dynex as reported earlier (30Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg (100 μl) was dispensed into a 96-well microtiter plate and placed in a luminometer. Luciferase activity was measured using Luciferase Assay Reagent II and Stop&Glo reagent. Variations in transfection efficiency were normalized by dividing the measurement for the firefly luciferase activity by that for the Renilla luciferase activity. Induction of Mineralization—Mineralization of cells was induced as described earlier (30Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Briefly cells grown to 80–90% confluence were treated with β-glycerophosphate (10 mm) and ascorbic acid (100 μg/ml) in the presence of dexamethasone (10 nm). Antibodies, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Mouse monoclonal C/EBPβ (SC-7962) antibody and rabbit polyclonal Nrf1 antibody (SC-13031) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Monoclonal 3XFLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma. Western blot and immunoprecipitations were carried out as described earlier (30Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. He G. Park K.W. Cho M. George A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17500-17508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Dot Blot and Reverse Northern Blot—Denatured GAPDH and DSP DNA fragments were blotted in duplicate onto a nylon membrane using Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus. Total RNA was extracted from control and H89 (100 μm, inhibitor of protein kinase A)-treated cells. [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNAs were synthesized using oligo d(T) and Superscript II (Invitrogen). The membrane was probed with labeled cDNAs followed by autoradiography. Mobility Shift Assay—Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was carried out to monitor the protein binding sites on the DSPP promoter. Nuclear extracts prepared from odontoblasts were used for EMSA as described earlier (31Narayanan K. Ramachandran A. Hao J. George A. Connect. Tissue Res. 2002; 43: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, oligos were synthesized as listed in Table I. The oligos were annealed and labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. Protein-DNA interactions were performed for 45 min in 4 mm Tris (pH 8.0) containing 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, and 100 ng of poly (dG-dC) along with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Typically 10 μg of nuclear proteins were incubated with 5 fmol of labeled oligos. Supershift experiments were carried out as described above except that the nuclear extracts were preincubated for 30 min at 4 °C with respective antibodies.Table IPrimers used for EMSA and site-directed mutagenesisWild typeAATAGATTATAAAGAAAAACCCAAAACCTTTATGTCAGTGTTTAGATTAA C/EBPβ Nrf1C/EBP mutationAATAGATTAcAAAtAggAACCCAAAACCTTTATGTCAGTGTTTAGATTAANrf1 mutationAATAGATTATAAAGAAAAACCCAAAACCTTTATtcgcGaGTTTAGATTAAC/EBP and Nrf1 mutationAATAGATTAcAAAtAggAACCCAAAACCTTTATtcgcGaGTTTAGATTAA Open table in a new tab Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to mutate the Nrf1 and C/EBPβ binding sites (listed in Table I) using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Promega). A mutation at the PKA phosphorylation site of Nrf1 was also carried out in a similar way. The oligos used were CTCAAGAAAGGCgcCAAGGAGAAGCAGGCT (lowercase and underlined were mutated) replacing Ser599 to Ala. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP assay was performed to demonstrate the in vivo interaction of C/EBP and Nrf1 to their respective responsive elements using the ChIP assay kit obtained from Upstate USA, Inc. Briefly odontoblasts were transfected with plasmid containing –700 to –400 bp of the DSPP promoter sequence. The DNA-protein complex was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing protease inhibitors mixture and scraped into a conical tube. The cells were lysed with SDS-lysis buffer (provided in the kit) for 10 min. The DNA was recovered with phenol/chloroform and diluted 10 times. This sample is referred to as the input for the experiment. Respective primary antibody was added to the DNA sample and incubated 12–14 h at 4 °C. The antibody-complex was allowed to bind to protein A-agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The DNA bound to the immune complexes was extracted with phenol/chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation and were used as templates for PCR. Anti-acetyl H4 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnologies) was used as a control for the ChIP assay. Protein Kinase Inhibitors—Three different kinase inhibitors were used. 100 μm H-89 (for PKA), 0.2 μm GF109203X (for protein kinase C), and 100 μm PD 98059 (for mitogen-activated protein kinase) were purchased from Biomol. Inc., and experiments were performed according to standard protocols. Cloning and Characterization of Rat DSPP Promoter—Approximately 1.7 kb of a DNA fragment, 5′-upstream of DSPP cDNA was amplified using PCR and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector to assay for transcriptional activity. This 1.7-kb DNA fragment was referred to as the rat DSPP promoter and has 81% similarity to the mouse DSPP promoter (3Feng J.Q. Luan X. Wallace J. Jing D. Ohshima T. Kulkarni A.B. D'Souza R.N. Kozak C.A. MacDougall M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9457-9464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Transient transfection assays reveal that the promoter is active only in odontoblast cells and inactive in osteoblast cells (MC3T3-E1) (Fig 1A). In order to identify the regulatory elements, serial deletions at the 5′-end were made by PCR and cloned into pGL3basic vector and transiently transfected into odontoblast cells. Luciferase assays of these constructs revealed (Fig. 1B) that an initial deletion of a ∼1250 bp at the 5′-end of the DSPP promoter increases its transcriptional activity when compared with the full-length DSPP promoter (–1710 bp). Further a deletion of another ∼300 bp (from –700 bp to –400 bp) increases the transcriptional activity with respect to the full-length DSPP promoter. This suggests the presence of repression elements within this 300-bp region. A 100-bp promoter fragment driving the luciferase gene showed greater activity than the full-length promoter sequence. C/EBPβ and Nrf1 Represses DSPP Promoter Activity—Analysis of the repression activity domain spanning between –700 and –400 bp upstream of the DSPP promoter revealed the presence of a C/EBPβ binding site in close proximity to the Nrf1 binding site. Further, this domain is conserved in the rat, mouse, and human DSPP gene. Initial transfections with different C/EBP (α, β, γ, and δ) members clearly showed that only the C/EBPβ expression plasmid can act as a repressor for the DSPP promoter (data not shown). We then defined the inhibitory role of C/EBPβ on the transcriptional activity of the DSPP gene using a luciferase assay. CMV-driven C/EBPβ expression plasmid was transfected with a luciferase reporter in odontoblasts. As shown in Fig. 2A, with an increase in concentration of C/EBPβ DNA, a corresponding decrease in the DSPP promoter activity was observed. Approximately 50% reduction of DSPP promoter activity was observed with the expression of 10 μg of C/EBPβ expression plasmid. Similarly, 50% reduction in DSPP promoter activity was observed with the expression of 5 μg of Nrf1 plasmid (Fig. 2B). Thus, both C/EBPβ and Nrf1 possess intrinsic transcriptional repressor activity. In this study, higher concentrations of the plasmid DNA was used because of the poor transfection efficiency of the odontoblast cell line. Western blot analysis was performed to indicate the transfection efficiency using FLAG antibody (Fig. 2, C and D). Nrf1 and C/EBPβ Synergistically Repress the DSPP Promoter—The binding sites for Nrf1 and C/EBPβ were observed to be in close proximity to each other (11-bp apart) and this prompted us to investigate their possible interactions. Results obtained from transient co-transfection with 1710 bp of the promoter region and overexpression of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ demonstrate a dramatic reduction in the promoter activity to only 10% indicating a synergistic repressor activity (Fig. 3). This suggests that Nrf1 and C/EBPβ act in concert to repress DSPP transcription possibly by functional interaction of these proteins. This result was further confirmed by Northern blot analysis of the DSPP gene after transfection with Nrf1 and C/EBPβ (Fig. 3). The presence of an Nrf1- and C/EBPβ-mediated repressor element between –700 and –400 bp of the DSPP promoter was identified by transient overexpression of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ along with the DSPP promoter deletion constructs (Fig. 4). Results with the 700-bp construct highlight the potential for synergism between Nrf1 and C/EBPβ to strongly suppress transcription (Fig. 4).Fig. 4Identification of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ binding elements in the DSPP promoter. Transient transfections were carried out with the expression plasmids of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ along with pGL3-DSPP reporter deletion constructs. Luciferase assays were carried out as described earlier. Results indicate the presence of a repressor element between –700 and –400-bp region containing C/EBPβ and Nrf1 binding sites. Deletion of this region failed to show the Nrf1- and C/EBPβ-mediated repression observed with the full-length promoter. Transfections were carried out in triplicate. Mean values were plotted with standard error.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Association of Nrf1 and C/EBPb—To test whether Nrf1 and C/EBPβ mutually interact with each other in vivo, cell extracts were prepared from odontoblasts, and the immunoprecipitation assay was carried out with a monoclonal C/EBPβ antibody. The presence of Nrf1 in immunoprecipitates was detected by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody against Nrf1 (Fig. 5, panel a). In a similar manner, immunoprecipitation with Nrf1 antibody followed by cross-blotting with C/EBPβ antibody show the presence of C/EBPβ in the complex (Fig. 5, panel b). These results indicate that Nrf1 and C/EBPβ co-exist as a complex in vivo. We have also explored the in vivo localization of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ by immunostaining with specific antibodies followed by confocal microscopy on MC3T3-E1 cells. As expected, Nrf1 and C/EBPβ colocalized within the nucleus of MC3T3-E1 cells (Supplementary Fig. 1). Binding of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ on the DSPP Promoter—The direct interaction of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ to their putative binding sites on the DSPP promoter was analyzed by EMSA. Protein components from nuclear extracts of odontoblasts formed a clear complex with oligonucleotides containing Nrf1 and C/EBPβ binding sequences (Fig. 6A). The binding of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ was confirmed by antibody-mediated supershift. Further, with Nrf1 and C/EBPβ antibodies together, a slower migration of the total complex in the gel was observed (Fig. 6A). EMSA results from the mutated oligonucleotides showed that mutation at the Nrf1 binding site did not affect the binding of C/EBPβ, and mutation at the C/EBPβ binding site had no effect on the binding of Nrf1 to the DSPP promoter. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the DNA binding property of Nrf1 is independent of the presence of C/EBPβ to its binding site and vice versa. Nrf1-mediated Repression of DSPP Promoter Requires C/EBPβ—Mutations were made at the binding sites of Nrf1 and C/EBPβ individually and in combination. These constructs were transfected and analyzed for their activities in the presence of either Nrf1 or C/EBPβ expression plasmids, and the controls used for each assay contained the respective mutations. Transient transfections followed by luciferase assays demonstrated that mutation at the Nrf1 binding site increased the DSPP promoter activity to 168% compared with the 100% activity of the wild type (Fig. 6B). Nrf1 overexpression did not have any obvious effect on the DSPP promoter containing the Nrf1 mutation; however, overexpression of C/EBPβ inhibited the promoter activity from 168 to 80%. This suggests that mutations at the Nrf1 binding site abolished the Nrf1-mediated repression, while retaining the C/EBPβ-mediated repression. On the other hand, mutations disrupting the C/EBPβ binding site resulted in an elevation of DSPP promoter activity to 197% compared with the control containing the mutant plasmid. Overexpression of either Nrf1 or C/EBPβ in odontoblasts did not have any effect on the mutant DSPP promoter. Thus, mutations at C/EBPβ binding site not only affected the C/EBPβ-associated transcription repression but also the Nrf1-mediated repression. Further, double mutations on both Nrf1 and C/EBPβ binding sites increased the DSPP promoter activity to 245% compared with the wild type, and overexpression of either C/EBPβ or Nrf1 did not have any effect on the double mutation constructs (Fig. 6B). The in vivo binding of C/EBPβ and Nrf1 to their respective sites was confirmed by ChIP assay (Fig. 6C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that Nrf1 requires the presence of C/EBPβ whereas C/EBPβ does not require Nrf1 to repress the DSPP promoter activity. Mapping the Repressor Domains in Both Nrf1 and C/EBPβ—As Nrf1 and C/EBPβ physically associate and functionally cooperate to repress DSPP promoter activity, we then sought to identify the regions in Nrf1 and C/EBPβ that are involved in transcriptional repression. Nrf1 and C/EBPβ deletions were cloned into the mammalian expression vector (pCMV-3XFLAG). Deletion constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 7. Odontoblasts were transiently transfected with the different constructs along with a luciferase reporter containing the DSPP promoter and assayed for luciferase activity. Results demonstrate that the full-length C/EBPβ deletion C1 and C2 did not substantially alter or relieve the C/EBPβ-mediated repression but C3 and C4 relieved this activity. Thus, the C-terminal region spanning residues 165–215 in C/EBP β contained the potential repression elements (Fig. 7A). Similarly, data for Nrf1 deletions in Fig. 7B demonstrate that the full-length Nrf1 and deletions"

In this study we demonstrate that this is dependent on the rapid and sustained activation of p38MAPK, in contrast to the transient activation of p38MAPK associated with bFGF-induced cell proliferation. Stem cell factor-induced survival of TC-32 cells was also associated with transient activation of p38MAPK. Inhibition of p38MAPK by SB202190 and p38MAPK small interfering RNA reduces bFGF-induced death in TC-32 cells, consistent with the hypothesis that activation of p38MAPK is essential for induction of death by bFGF. This appears to be dependent on sustained activation of p38MAPK, demonstrated by inhibition of bFGF-induced cell death following addition of SB202190 to TC-32 cells 5 min after exposure to bFGF (20 ng/ml) and activation of p38MAPK. Prolonged activation of p38MAPK is accompanied by a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of Ras and ERK; inhibition of ERK phosphorylation using the MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 rescued ∼30% of cells from bFGF-induced death suggesting ERK plays a secondary role in the induction of death. This hypothesis is supported by observations in the A673 cell line; bFGF induced sustained activation of ERK and transient activation of p38MAPK, which was not associated with cell death. These data demonstrate that sustained activation of p38MAPK is essential for activation of the death cascade following exposure of Ewing's sarcoma family of tumors cells to bFGF and provide evidence that activation of p38MAPK results in an up-regulation of the death receptor p75NTR.

ESFT exhibit a common genetic rearrangement involving fusion of the 5′ end of the EWS gene on chromosome 22 to the 3′ portion of members of the Ets gene family of transcription factors. In over 90% of cases the Ets gene family member is fused to the Fli1 gene located on chromosome 11 (4Delattre O. Zucman J. Melot T. Garau X.S. Zucker J.M. Lenoir G.M. Ambros P.F. Sheer D.

ESFT typically arise in the bone or soft tissue of adolescents and young adults, ∼15–30% of patients presenting with metastatic disease. The outcome for this group of patients is particularly poor despite the use of aggressive therapeutic regimes, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic strategies.

However, we have found no evidence of such a survival loop, and we demonstrated recently that treatment of ESFT with bFGF results in the up-regulation of the death receptor p75NTR and induction of cell death (15Sturla L.M.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The intracellular signaling pathways leading to the induction of cell death following exposure of ESFT cells to bFGF are unknown. Although our preliminary results have shown that incubation of ESFT cells with bFGF causes phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and activation of the downstream signaling molecules Ras and ERK (16Westwood G. Dibling B.C. Cuthbert-Heavens D. Burchill S.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whether these events are important effectors of bFGF-induced cell death is not clear. Following receptor activation, phosphorylated tyrosines function as binding sites for a number of downstream adapter and signaling proteins, including the docking protein FRS2 that recruits several signal transduction molecules leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-AKT anti-apoptotic pathway (17Kouhara H.

Specificity of response is achieved by the influence of the MAPK superfamily of proteins on gene expression and regulation of downstream kinases or transcription factors. This family of proteins shares many structural similarities and includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinases ERK 1 and ERK 2, the p38MAP kinases, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK; also known as the stress-activated protein kinases). They are usually activated by distinct extracellular stimuli; ERK is typically stimulated by growth factors and mitogenic stimuli; p38MAPK and JNK are primarily activated by cellular stress including heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress (19Robinson M.J.

Although p38MAPK and JNK may be co-activated by some agonists, the upstream signaling kinases are specific, i.e. p38MAPK is activated via MKK 3 and 6 (and in some cases MKK 4), and activation of JNK is catalyzed by MKK 4 and 7 (40Tournier C.

In this study we have investigated the role of the Ras-ERK, p38MAPK, and JNK cascades in mediating growth factor-induced survival or death in ESFT cells, and we examined the hypothesis that activation of p38MAPK, JNK, and/or ERK may induce p75NTR expression leading to cell death in these cells following exposure to bFGF. We have shown that exposure of ESFT cells to bFGF induces sustained activation of Ras-ERK and p38MAPK and that the sustained activation of p38MAPK is an important effector of bFGF-induced cell death. This sustained activation leads to up-regulation of the p75NTR death receptor, which appears to be independent of JNK activation. In contrast, the survival effects of SCF in ESFT and the proliferative effects of bFGF in neuroblastoma cells are associated with transient activation of p38MAPK. Anti-ERK, anti-Ras, and anti-α-tubulin antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. The anti-Ras antibody (OP-40) used for immunoprecipitation was obtained from Merck. Anti-phosphorylation-specific ERK and p75NTR antibodies were obtained from Promega. Pan-anti-p38MAPK, anti-phosphorylation-specific p38MAPK antibodies, and the nonradioactive p38MAP kinase assay kit were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Total JNK and phosphorylated JNK 1 and 2 were detected by using the PhosphoPlus® SAPK/JNK (Thr-183/Tyr-185) antibody kit also from Cell Signaling Technology. p38MAPK α antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and the p38MAPKβ-specific antibody was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were purchased from Sigma. Alexa Fluor 680-labeled secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes. bFGF and SCF were obtained from Sigma and were reconstituted in PBS containing 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, aliquoted, and stored at –20 °C. The inhibitors of ERK (PD98059) and p38MAPKα and -β (SB202190 and SB203580) were purchased from Calbiochem, reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), aliquoted, and stored at –20 °C. Cells were cultured on Primaria plastic (Falcon) for all experiments. RDES, TC-32, and TTC-466 ESFT cells were grown in RPMI 1640 media (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Seralab, Sussex, UK); culture media for TTC-466 cells were supplemented with 10% conditioned media. A673 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM) (Sigma) and 10% FCS. SK-ES1 cells were grown in McCoy's media (Sigma) plus 15% FCS and SK-N-MC cells in DMEM/F-12 (Sigma) plus 10% FCS. SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of DMEM and modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% FCS. TC-32 cells were a gift from Dr. J. Toretsky (Georgetown, University Medical School, Washington, D. C.), and the TTC-466 cell line was a gift from Dr. P. Sorenson (British Columbia Children's Hospital, Vancouver, Canada). All the other cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. pGEX-RBD was a kind gift from Dr. J. Downward (Cancer Research UK, London, United Kingdom) and contains the Ras-binding domain of Raf (amino acids 1–149) fused to glutathione-Sepharose transferase. Cells were seeded in 60-mm plates and allowed to adhere for 24 h prior to treatment with growth factors or inhibitors at the concentrations and times indicated. To analyze the effect of growth factors in the absence of serum, media were aspirated, and the cells were washed briefly with serum-free media and cultured under serum-free conditions for 24 h prior to growth factor stimulation. Stimulation of the cells with growth factors and/or incubation with inhibitors was terminated by placing the cells on ice, aspiration of the culture media, and washing the cell monolayer with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma), 25 mm sodium fluoride (Sigma)) for 30 min on ice. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 11,600 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was retained for analysis by immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, or affinity precipitation. Protein content of extracts was determined by using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysate was denatured by adding SDS to a final concentration of 0.1% and heating for 3 min at 100 °C before cooling on ice. Pan-Ras antibody (1 μg) and protein A-Sepharose™ CL-4B (30 μl of 50% slurry; Amersham Biosciences) were added to cell lysate (500 μg) and incubated with mixing at 4 °C overnight. Beads were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times in ice-cold PBS and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. They were then resuspended in SDS-Laemmli buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting using anti-Ras antibodies. Cell lysate (50 μg) was size-fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Biosciences) in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20% methanol) using a mini transblot system (Bio-Rad) overnight at 4 °C. The membranes were then hybridized with antibodies and analyzed using ECL or for quantitative analysis using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor). To aid resolution of phosphorylated ERK proteins, N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide was added to the separating gel at 200 parts acrylamide to 1 part N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide. Enhanced Chemiluminescence—Membranes were blocked with a 5% nonfat milk solution in TTBS (0.05% Tween 20, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl) for 2 h. Immobilized antigen was detected following incubation with primary antibody diluted in 1% nonfat milk solution in TTBS for 2 h. Blots were then washed using TTBS and incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in 1% nonfat milk solution in TTBS for 45 min. After the blots were washed using TTBS, they were developed using ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Odyssey Infrared Imaging System—Membranes were blocked using Li-Cor blocking buffer for 2 h and then incubated for a further 2 h with the primary antibody diluted in a 1:1 mixture of Li-Cor blocking buffer and PBS supplemented with 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were then washed using TPBS (0.1% Tween 20, 20 mm Na2HPO4 (pH 7.4), 120 mm NaCl)) and incubated with the appropriate Alexa Fluor 680-labeled secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) for 2 h. After the blots were washed with TPBS, they were analyzed using the Odyssey infrared imaging system (Li-Cor) to analyze the relative density of protein bands. Affinity precipitation was carried out essentially as described previously (43Taylor S.J. Shalloway D. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1621-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Briefly, BL21 (Invitrogen) Escherichia coli harboring pGEX-RBD was grown at 37 °C until they reached an absorbance of 0.4–0.6, as measured using a spectrophotometer. Expression of GST-RBD was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma) for 3 h. E. coli cells were harvested by centrifugation (500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Sigma) in PBS) and sonicated. Debris was removed by centrifugation (21,500 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4 °C, after which the beads were washed four times with wash buffer (20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Beads were stored at 4 °C in wash buffer containing 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide until required. Cell lysate (500 μg) was incubated with immobilized GST-RBD for 45 min on a rotating wheel at 4 °C. Beads were isolated by centrifugation at 11,600 × g, washed three times in ice-cold wash buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS), and resuspended in SDS-Laemmli sample buffer. The levels of GTP-Ras were determined by immunoblotting using anti-Ras antibodies. The presence of p38MAPKα and p38MAPKβ in TC-32 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (results not shown). siRNAs to p38MAPKα (p38 MAPK SMARTpool® siRNA reagent) and a nonspecific control SMARTpool® siRNA were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Two different p38MAPKβ siRNAs, designated p38β1 and p38β2, were designed and purchased from Qiagen: p38β1 siRNA sequence 5′-AACTGGATGCATTACAACCAA-3′ and p38β2 siRNA sequence 5′-AAGGAGCTCACTTACCAGGAA-3′. siRNA (100 nm) was delivered to 5 × 106 TC-32 cells by electroporation. Cells were trypsinized, resuspended in 400 μl of growth media, mixed with either one of the p38MAPK-specific siRNAs, a nonspecific scrambled siRNA control or a buffer negative control, and electroporated. Electroporation was carried out in 4-mm GenePulser cuvettes (Bio-Rad) at 500 millifarads and 400 V using the GenePulser system (Bio-Rad). The cells were seeded into fresh growth media and allowed to adhere for 24 h. The cells were then either harvested and protein extracted for Western blotting or treated with bFGF for 48 h and then analyzed by flow cytometry of PI and annexin V-positive cells. These transfectants were then either incubated for 48 h prior to annexin V and PI labeling or treated with bFGF for 48 h prior to labeling. Cells (1 × 105) were seeded in Primaria 6-well plates (Falcon) and incubated in normal media with serum for 24 h. For viable cell counts in the presence of serum, the media were removed, and the cell monolayer was washed once with normal culture media and 2.5 ml of culture media containing FCS alone, supplemented with bFGF, or SCF was added. Cells were incubated at 37 °C in a 95% air, 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere for 24–72 h. After incubation the cells were harvested using EDTA (0.05%) and trypsin (0.1%); viable and nonviable cell number was counted using the trypan blue exclusion assay and a Neubauer hemocytometer. Results are shown as mean ± S.E. (n = 4). For viable cell counts in the absence of serum, cells were seeded and allowed to adhere to plates overnight in the presence of serum; media were then aspirated; cells washed in serum-free media, and experiments were carried out as above but in media with no serum. Cell death was quantified by using the annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate apoptosis detection kit I (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were treated as indicated and harvested by trypsinization and centrifugation (500 × g for 5 min), and the cell pellet was washed in ice-cold PBS. Cells were resuspended in binding buffer and then labeled with annexin V (1 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (PI; 1 μg/ml) for 30 min in the dark. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (BD Biosciences FACSCaliber™) coupled with the Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were scored as necrotic (PI-positive/annexin V-negative) or apoptotic (annexin V-positive/PI-negative and annexin V/PI-positive). A minimum of three independent experiments was carried out. Cell death was visualized by electron microscopy. Cell pellets were fixed in glutaraldehyde and osmium tetraoxide, infiltrated with araldite, embedded in fresh resin, and polymerized. Sections (80 μm) were cut and mounted on gold grids before staining first with uranyl acetate in methanol followed by Reynold's lead citrate. The p38MAPK(total) and p38MAPK (Thr(P)-180/Tyr(P)-182) ELISAs (BIOSOURCE) were performed as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were treated as indicated and lysed in the recommended lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm Na4P2O7, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). A 1:25 dilution of the lysate was applied to the p38MAPK antibody-coated 96-well plate along with standards and controls. Phosphorylated or total p38MAPK was detected by using the supplied detection antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary, and stabilized chromagen. Absorbance was measured at 450 nm using a Titertek Multiscan® MCC plate reader. The amount of phosphorylated and total p38MAPK was determined by reading the measured absorbance from a standard curve. p38MAPK(total) was measured by ELISA to control for the amount of protein assayed between samples, and the amount of phosphorylated p38MAPK (Thr(P)-180/Tyr(P)-182) was adjusted accordingly. By using the nonradioactive p38MAPK assay (Cell Signaling Technology), the level of active p38MAPK was analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, treated cells were lysed in the lysis buffer provided (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) and supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. p38MAPK was immunoprecipitated from 200 μl of whole cell lysate using an immobilized phospho-p38MAPK (Thr-180/Tyr-182) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C with constant agitation. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with the kinase buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2) provided with the kit. The immunoprecipitated p38MAPK was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in kinase buffer containing 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of ATF-2 fusion protein. The reaction was terminated by adding 2× Laemmli buffer and heating the samples to 95 °C for 5 min. The samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for phosphorylated ATF-2. Analyses were undertaken by using SPSS. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance when comparing three or more conditions. When variation among the means was considered significant (p < 0.05), the treated samples were compared with controls (untreated) using a Dunnett's post-hoc multiple comparison test where appropriate. Differences were considered significant when p < 0.05. To investigate the effect of p38MAPK and ERK inhibitors on bFGF-induced cell death, data were adjusted as relative to the percentage of cell death induced by bFGF. The three-factor interaction effects (estimated effects of SB202190, PD98059, and bFGF) were not statistically significant (p = 0.75); the estimated effects of the combination of factors was calculated from the relative death log score mean. bFGF Induces Cell Death in ESFT Cells through Apoptosis and Necrosis—Treatment of TC-32 and TTC-466 cells with bFGF (20 ng/ml) resulted in a significant reduction in viable cell number at 48 and 72 h (Fig. 1a, i and ii). This reduction in viable cell number reflected an induction of cell death demonstrated by electron microscopy (Fig. 1b) and an increase in annexin V- and PI-positive cells detected by flow cytometry (Fig. 1c). TC-32 and TTC-466 cells treated with bFGF exhibited classical features of apoptosis, i.e. chromatin margination, nuclear condensation, and the formation of apoptotic bodies, and characteristics of necrosis such as an increase in cytoplasmic volume, vacuolation, and disruption of the plasma membrane (Fig. 1b). These observations are consistent with our previous data (15Sturla L.M. Westwood G. Selby P.J. Lewis I.J. Burchill S.A. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 6160-6170PubMed Google Scholar, 16Westwood G. Dibling B.C. Cuthbert-Heavens D. Burchill S.A. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 809-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). In contrast bFGF induced a significant increase in viable cell number in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-SH between 24 and 72 h of exposure (Fig."

An inducible E2A reconstitution system further demonstrated that E2A-mediated repression of Nfil3 and FGFR2 was reversible.

Chem. 158, 521–531) Full-Text PDF Open Access Lymphocytes develop from multipotent hematopoietic stem cells to provide cell-mediated and humoral immunological protection against foreign antigens. Hematopoietic stem cells give rise to mature B- and T-lymphocytes through a series of well defined and highly ordered differentiation stages in the bone marrow and thymus, respectively (1Kondo M. Wagers A.J. Manz M.G. Prohaska S.S. Scherer D.C. Beilhack G.F. Shizuru J.A. Weissman I.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 21: 759-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). These stages are functionally defined by the progressive assembly and expression of the lymphocyte antigen receptors. These antigen receptors are generated through tightly regulated genomic recombination events at the B- and T-lymphocyte antigen receptor loci to establish a diverse pool of receptor specificities (2Bassing C.H. Swat W. Alt F.W. Cell. 2002; 109: 45-55Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). Antigen receptor gene recombination and thus lymphocyte differentiation requires the activity of numerous broadly expressed and lineage-specific transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors encoded by the E2A gene have been identified as essential regulators of gene expression during lymphocyte development (3Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Semin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 405-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The E2A proteins were initially characterized as immunoglobulin heavy (IgH) 1The abbreviations used are: IgH, immunoglobulin heavy; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; RT, reverse transcription; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorting; GFP, green fluorescent protein. and light chain enhancer-binding factors and have since been shown to bind consensus E-box motifs (CANNTG) in the promoters and enhancers of numerous lymphoid lineage-specific genes (4Murre C.

J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5398-5407PubMed Google Scholar) and are required for the initiation of B-lymphocyte development in the bone marrow. Mice deficient for E2A show a complete and persistent block at the earliest stage of B-cell development prior to the initiation of immunoglobulin heavy chain rearrangements (7Zhuang Y. Soriano P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 8Bain G. Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S.

E2A has been implicated in regulating the expression of multiple BCR complex components, including the surrogate light chain λ5, the BCR signaling molecule mb-1, and the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) and k light chain genes (9Schlissel M.

Whereas early ectopic expression and gene targeting studies indicated that these genes were downstream of E2A function, it was not known whether E2A directly regulated their transcription. A gene tagging-based chromatin immunoprecipitation system was recently used to confirm that E2A is physically associated with many of these B-cell-specific genes (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The ChIP-based approach was also applied to identification of novel E2A targets in B-cell development. However, the total number of E2A target genes recovered in this study is still limited due to low cloning efficiency and binding specificity. Previous investigations of E2A-deficient mice clearly demonstrated the importance of E2A in lymphocyte development (7Zhuang Y. Soriano P. Weintraub H. Cell. 1994; 79: 875-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar, 8Bain G. Maandag E.C. Izon D.J. Amsen D. Kruisbeek A.M. Weintraub B.C. Krop I. Schlissel M.S.

However, the strong block in B-lymphocyte development, complex thymocyte phenotype, and poor postnatal survival seen in these mice precluded more detailed studies on functions for E2A in lymphocyte differentiation and lymphoid gene regulation. A conditional E2A deletion model was developed in our laboratory to evaluate roles for E2A specifically in developing lymphocytes (17Pan L. Hanrahan J. Li J. Hale L.P. Zhuang Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Mice carrying the loxp-flanked E2A allele (E2Aloxp) enabled lineage-restricted deletion of the E2A gene based upon ectopic expression of the Cre recombinase. Here we describe a conditional E2A deletion system based upon the E2Aloxp mouse model for studying E2A-mediated gene regulation in B-lymphocyte development. We have utilized this conditional E2A knockout system in conjunction with our gene tagging-based ChIP strategy to investigate novel functions for E2A proteins in gene regulation during early B-lymphocyte development. Microarray analysis on E2A-deficient pre-B-cell lines has revealed numerous genes with E2A-dependent expression patterns. We have further evaluated a subset of these genes that appear to be directly suppressed by E2A in pre-B-cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis on the regulatory elements of these genes provides the first physiological evidence for direct gene repression by E2A proteins. These studies demonstrate novel functions for E2A proteins in both positive and negative gene regulation during lymphocyte development. Pre-B-cell Lines—The Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B-cell lines E2AFH1B and E2AGFP were previously derived from bone marrow of mice carrying the dual affinity-tagged E2A allele (E2AFH/FH) (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or from E2AGFP/GFP mice (18Zhuang Y. Jackson A. Pan L. Shen K. Dai M. Mol. Immunol. 2004; 40: 1165-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For gene array studies, pre-B-cell lines were derived from bone marrow of a mouse carrying the loxp-flanked E2A allele (E2Aloxp/loxp) (17Pan L. Hanrahan J. Li J. Hale L.P. Zhuang Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Transformed cells were then transduced with a retrovirus encoding Cre recombinase as well as a puromycin resistance cassette. A control cell line was established in parallel by infecting the E2Aloxp/loxp pre-B-cells with a retrovirus encoding Cre recombinase in the antisense orientation. Transduced cells were selected by puromycin treatment and three different clonal E2A-deficient populations were established by limiting dilution plating. All cell lines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. RT-PCR Assay—Total RNA was purified using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) from cultured Abelson transformed pre-B-cell lines, and cDNA was synthesized with random hexamers. The following oligonucleotide primers were used in PCR analysis of serial 3-fold cDNA dilutions: E2A-E47, E8 (5′-AGG TCC CAC GCA CGC GCA CC-3′) and E20 (5′-CGC CTG CTG CAG GAT GAG CA-3′); EBF, EBF for (5′-TCC AGG AAA GCA TCC AAC GG-3′) and EBF rev (5′-TCG TGT GTG AGC AAT ACT CGG C-3′); Igα, mb-1 for (5′-CCT CTC CTC CTC TTC TTG TCA TAC G-3′) and mb-1 rev (5′-CCC CTG TGT TCT TGT TTA CTT CGG-3′); Igβ, B29 for (5′-TGT TCC TGC TGC TGC TCT TCT C-3′) and B29 rev (5′-TCG GTG ACA TTA TGG TTG GCG-3′); Pax-5, Pax-5 for (5′-CCG CCA AAG GAT AGT GGA AAC TTG-3′) and Pax-5 rev (5′-CAC AGT GTC ATT GTC ACA GAC TCG C-3′); EF1α, EF1α-for (5′-AGT TTG AGA AGG AGG CTG CT-3′) and EF1α-rev (5′-CAA CAA TCA GGA CAG CAC AGT C-3′); FGFR2, FGFR2A (5′-GCG CTT CAT CTG CCT GGT CTT GG-3′) and FGFR2B (5′-TCC AAC TGA TCA CGG CGG CAT CT-3′); NFIL3, NFIL3A (5′-AGC GCC GCC TCA ATG ACC TGG TT-3′) and NFIL3B (5′-GCT CAC GGC AGC CTT GGA TGT CT-3′). Flow Cytometry Assay—FACS analysis of the parental E2A wild type cells and the E2A-deficient lines was performed on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using the following fluorescent antibody conjugates: CD19-PE and CD43-PE (Pharmingen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Abelson transformed pre-B-cells were cultured and treated with 1 μm tamoxifen dissolved in Me2SO or Me2SO alone as indicated. Nuclei were isolated, and nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (19Bain G. Gruenwald S. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3522-3529Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Extracts were incubated with 32P-labeled μE5 oligonucleotide probe with or without anti-E2A monoclonal antibody YAE (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel containing Walsh TBE buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to a phosphor screen (Amersham Biosciences) for analysis. Microarray Analysis—RNA was isolated from three independent E2A-deficient pre-B-cell lines and the antisense Cre-infected control cell line using Trizol solution followed by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. RNA was then resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated distilled H2O for global differential gene expression analysis using the Affymetrix murine microarray (U74Av2). All samples were reversetranscribed, analyzed, and processed by the Duke University Microarray Core Facility. Subsequent data analysis was conducted with the R statistical package using the Bioconductor library (20Dudoit S. Gentleman R.C. Quackenbush J. BioTechniques. 2003; : 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Briefly, gene expression levels were quantified by the gcRMA model (n = 3). The p values from the t test were adjusted by false discovery rate (21Tsai C.A. Hsueh H.M. Chen J.J. Biometrics. 2003; 59: 1071-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) for multiple comparisons. Chromatin Extracts and Immunoprecipitations—Chromatin extracts were prepared using a modified version of the protocol described by Fernandez et al. (22Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 107 pre-B-cells (E2AFH1B and E2AGFP) were harvested and fixed by adding one-tenth culture volume of fixing buffer (11% formaldehyde, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9). After fixing for 15 min rocking gently at room temperature, one-twentieth volume of 2.5 m glycine quenching buffer was added, and the cells were incubated for 5 min rocking at room temperature (all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C). Fixed cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with PBS, resuspended in 15 ml of Triton buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25% Triton X-100), and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were then harvested, resuspended in 15 ml of NaCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl) and incubated for an additional 15 min on ice. Washed cells were harvested, resuspended in 1 ml of sonication buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS; supplemented with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin), and sonicated (Fisher Scientific 550 tapered microtip probe, setting 4.5) for 14 cycles of 25 s on a cold block with 15 s of cooling between each cycle. Sonicates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min, and bulk chromatin extracts were harvested as supernatants and stored at –80 °C. E2A-bound DNA fragments were isolated from chromatin extracts using either the previously described anti-FLAG one-step purification protocol (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) or the new dual epitope isolation protocol. For dual epitope purifications, bulk chromatin extracts (2 mg) from the E2AFH1B pre-B-cell line and the E2AGFP control cell line were thawed on ice, and one-tenth volume of 5× extraction/wash buffer (250 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 1.5 m NaCl) was added to each. Samples were then incubated with 100 μl of washed Talon cobalt affinity resin for 30 min rotating slowly at room temperature. Bound resin was then harvested by centrifugation, washed twice for 10 min each with 1× extraction/wash buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl), and transferred to gravity flow chromatography columns (Bio-Rad polyprep 0.8 × 4.0 cm). After the resins settled, the column end caps were removed, and the resins were washed with 3 ml of 1× extraction/wash buffer. Bound protein-DNA complexes were then eluted three times with 500 μl of 100 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and the eluted materials were collected into 15-ml conical tubes. Secondary anti-FLAG immunoprecipitations were then performed on the eluted fractions from the Cobalt affinity resin (or on bulk chromatin extracts for single-epitope purifications). Eluted solutions were diluted 1:10 with ChIP buffer (140 mm NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml yeast tRNA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated with 50 μl of washed anti-FLAG-conjugated M2-agarose (Sigma) for 2 h at 4 °C rotating slowly. Bound agarose was harvested by centrifugation, washed once with 10 ml of ChIP buffer, and then transferred to microcentrifuge tubes. The bound agarose was washed twice with 1 ml of ChIP buffer, twice with 1 ml of ChIP buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, twice with 1 ml of wash buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm LiCl, 1 mm EDTA), and twice with 1 ml of TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). Bound DNA was eluted for 15 min at 65 °C in 250 μl of elution buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS), and both bound and input DNA samples were adjusted to 0.5% SDS in 500 μl. Samples were incubated at 65 °C overnight to reverse cross-links and then RNase-treated, deproteinized, and precipitated as described by Fernandez et al. (22Fernandez L.A. Winkler M. Grosschedl R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 196-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Processed DNA fragments were resuspended in 50 μl of distilled water. PCR Analysis of Immunoprecipitated DNA—PCR screening for enrichment of target regulatory regions was performed using a slightly modified version of the original protocol (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Serial 3-fold dilutions of input chromatin and immunoprecipitated DNA were PCR-amplified for 32–34 cycles (94 °C for 45 s, 57 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 45 s, with a 2-min final extension at 72 °C) in 20 μl of PCR buffer containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 and Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen). PCR samples were then resolved on 1% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Previously published oligonucleotide sequences were used in PCR screening of IgH enhancers and λ5 and mb-1 promoters (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The following primer sequences were used to screen for E2A binding to novel target loci in ChIP-PCR analysis: FGFR2-A (5′-TGG TGG CTT GCG GCT GTC CAC TT-3′) and FGFR2-B (5′-CAG AGA GGC TGT GCC TCC AGA GC-3′); pNfil3-A (5′-GCC ACT GAA GTA GAA GGG TTT GT-3′) and pNfil3-B (5′-GTC CCT TGG GCA GCT GTG TGC TA-3′). Inducible E2A Reconstitution System—293T cells were cotransfected with the GFP-expressing E47-estrogen receptor fusion construct MigR1-E47R (23Zhao F. Vilardi A. Neely R.J. Choi J.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6346-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) along with the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein coat protein and gag/pol. Retroviral supernatant was harvested, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and used to transduce an E2A-deficient clonal pre-B-cell line. Transduced cells were selected by FACS based upon GFP expression to establish a stable bulk population of E47R-reconstituted cells. For induction of E47R activity, cells were cultured in the presence of 1 μm tamoxifen (resuspended in Me2SO) for 5 h. A conditional E2A deletion mouse model was previously established in our laboratory by introducing the loxp-flanked E2A allele (E2Aloxp) into the genomic E2A locus (17Pan L. Hanrahan J. Li J. Hale L.P. Zhuang Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 3923-3932Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This E2Aloxp model was adapted to facilitate studies on E2A-mediated gene regulation in B-lymphocyte development. Pre-B-cell lines were first derived by transforming E2Aloxp/loxp bone marrow with the Abelson murine leukemia virus. Abelson-transformed pre-B-cells were then transduced with a retrovirus encoding a puromycin resistance cassette along with the Cre recombinase in either the sense (E2A-deleted cell lines) or antisense (control line) orientation. Transduced cells were selected by puromycin treatment, and three independent clonal E2A-deficient populations were subsequently established. Complete deletion of E2A in each clone was confirmed by genomic PCR specific for either the deleted or undeleted alleles (Fig. 1A). The absence of E2A expression in each E2A-deficient cell line was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1B). FACS analysis demonstrates that E2A-deficient B-cells maintain expression of the surface antigens CD43 and CD19, indicating that these cells retain a phenotype indicative of pro- or early pre-B-cells (Fig. 1C). In order to confirm that E2A-/- Abelson B-cells maintain their global B-cell gene expression profile, we evaluated the relative transcript levels of important B-cell-specific genes. Transcript levels of the genes mb-1 and B29, which encode the B-cell receptor-associated signaling molecules Igα and Igβ, respectively, were not significantly altered by E2A deletion (Fig. 1D). Expression levels of the Pax-5 gene, which encodes the B-cell-specific transcription factor BSAP and EBF, another important B-cell transcription factor, were also unaffected by E2A deletion. These data strongly indicate that E2A deficiency in pre-B-cells does not cause an overall shift in cell identity away from the B-cell lineage. Total RNA was isolated from three independent E2A-deficient pre-B-cell lines, and gene expression levels were compared with that of the antisense Cre-transduced control cell line using Affymetrix microarrays. These microarray experiments revealed numerous genes with E2A-dependent expression patterns in the deficient pre-B-cell lines. For the initial analysis, we chose to use these relatively high stringent criteria: 1) average -fold change larger than 3; 2) average difference larger then 48 intensity units; 3) adjusted p value smaller than 0.01; and 4) detectable hybridization signal in at least one of the four hybridizations. This analysis yielded 32 independent probe sets that are down-regulated and 35 that are up-regulated due to E2A disruption (Table I). The previously characterized E2A target gene immunoglobulin heavy chain and a number of novel punitive E2A target genes were significantly down-regulated in the absence of E2A (Table I, upper section).Table ISummary of microarray analysis Shown is a summary of microarray analysis on E2A-deficient pre-B cell lines. Global gene expression profiles from three independent E2A-deficient Abelson pre-B cell clones were analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays (U74Av2) and compared with the gene expression profile from E2A+/+ (antisense Cre-transduced) pre-B cells. The table indicates transcripts whose expression was significantly altered (average 3-fold or greater) across three E2A-deficient pre-B cell clones compared with the E2A+/+ pre-B cell line. Transcripts down-regulated 3-fold or greater in the E2A-deficient cell lines are shown in the upper section of the table. The lower section of the table includes transcripts up-regulated 3-fold or greater in the E2A-deficient cell lines.Accession numberGene nameChangep value-foldAF099973Schlafen 2-261.70.000123X04653Lymphocyte antigen 6 complex, locus A-222.15.58E-05AA204265B lymphoid kinase-112.43.04E-05AA795946Immune associated nucleotide 1-101.60.000143X98471Epithelial membrane protein 1-81.18.09E-05X02466Unknown mRNA-68.70.001694X03453Unknown mRNA-65.50.000141AI844939CREBBP/EP300-inhibitory protein 1-53.90.21E-05X02463Unknown mRNA-48.90.002875AI844839RIKEN cDNA 6330442E10 gene-48.20.000444X00496Ia-associated invariant chain-26.50.002311M30903B lymphoid kinase-24.70.000245AF099973Schlafen 2-22.60.000535U81453Myosin VIIa-22.40.000337X67210Unknown (protein for MGC:68300)-220.002151AI835274Cytoplasmic FMR1-interacting protein 2-19.30.000711AF065324Immunoglobulin heavy chain (J558 family)-18.10.000273AJ007970Guanylate nucleotide-binding protein 2-12.60.012706L38444T-cell-specific GTPase-120.011238U09816GM2 ganglioside activator protein-11.60.002324AI553536RIKEN cDNA E030024M05 gene-60.007887M38700Thyroid autoantigen-5.60.001055L29441Tumor differentially expressed 1-5.30.004501AW125333Ceramide kinase-50.003614AI852553Thymosin, β 10-3.90.016597J02980Alkaline phosphatase 2, liver-3.70.011843M35244Histocompatibility 2, T region locus 10-3.30.000239U72519Ena-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-3.20.005328AI046826Growth factor receptor-bound protein 2-associated protein 1-3.10.006082AW125526RIKEN cDNA 0610038D11 gene-3.10.004102U10410Recombinant antineuraminidase single chain Ig VH and VL domains-30.002839AI850401DNA segment, Chr 15, Wayne State University 75, expressed-30.009169Accession numberGene nameChangep value-foldM34141Prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 115.10.010314U04354Scinderin11.80.004649AF019385Heparan sulfate (glucosamine) 3-O-sulfotransferase 18.20.000513M13352Thymidylate synthase8.10.005353U92454WW domain binding protein 57.40.00198D12646Kinesin family member 47.20.000119AA590345RIKEN cDNA C330027C09 gene7.20.008416AW123907Kelch domain containing 25.60.00714U80932Serine/threonine kinase 65.40.01059AF002823Budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 homolog (S. cerevisiae)5.10.006987U19596Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2C (p18, inhibits CDK4)5.10.001504AW123269RIKEN cDNA 2900037I21 gene4.68.83E-06AA184423Unknown mRNA4.50.00087U83902MAD2 (mitotic arrest-deficient, homolog)-like 1 (yeast)4.50.004558X64713Cyclin B14.40.008331L29480Serine/threonine kinase 184.30.003255X75483Cyclin A24.30.006751AJ223293Kinesin family member 114.10.001694AA007891Kinesin family member 2C40.01095AI853802Phosphofructokinase, platelet3.90.005044U13174Solute carrier family 12, member 23.90.004716M86377Ttk protein kinase3.80.008107M23362Fibroblast growth factor receptor 23.80.001661AW122347Rac GTPase-activating protein 13.80.002574L11316ect2 oncogene3.80.015746M15668Phosphoglycerate kinase 13.70.016656X82786Antigen identified by monoclonal antibody Ki 673.70.004989U01915Topoisomerase (DNA) II alpha3.50.003634Z35401H2A histone family, member X3.40.003817AA275196RIKEN cDNA 2610201A12 gene3.30.015762X66032Cyclin B23.30.011732M25944Carbonic anhydrase 23.20.008015U28656Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 13.10.007679AB017189Solute carrier family 7+B100, member 530.009212X54327Glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase30.013704 Open table in a new tab The expression of another subset of genes was found to be dramatically up-regulated in the absence of E2A (Table I, lower section). These up-regulated genes represented nearly one-half of the genes with significant and consistent changes in E2A-dependent expression in the pre-B-cell lines. Although E2A is generally considered a positive regulator of transcription, these findings suggested that E2A proteins might be involved in the lineage-specific repression of certain genes as well. E2A-dependent gene expression profiling was combined with chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis to further characterize E2A target genes in B-lymphocyte development. We previously utilized a gene tagging-based ChIP system (E2AFH) to investigate physiological E2A interaction within numerous genomic regulatory regions in pre-B-cells (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, the anti-FLAG purification procedure used in our original ChIP study incorporated only one of the two affinity tags expressed on the E2AFH fusion protein. To further improve the specificity of the E2A ChIP, a dual epitope purification methodology was developed for more selective isolation of E2A-bound DNA fragments from the pre-B-cell line E2AFH1B (this line carries dual affinity-tagged E2A alleles) (16Greenbaum S. Zhuang Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 15030-15035Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The His and FLAG tags were sequentially used in the affinity purification of E2A bound chromatin. We first evaluated this revised protocol for E2A interaction with the regulatory regions of the λ5 surrogate light chain and the mb-1 genes (13Sigvardsson M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3640-3654Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14Sigvardsson M. Clark D.R. Fitzsimmons D. Doyle M. Akerblad P. Breslin T. Bilke S. Li R. Yeamans C. Zhang G. Hagman J. Mol. Cell.

https://openalex.org/W2069409546,"In the prion diseases, a prolonged, asymptomatic incubation period precedes the onset of neurologic dysfunction. At present, a noninvasive test is not available for the presymptomatic diagnosis of prion disease, and thus the report of a test for prions using urine has been of great interest (Shaked, G. M., Shaked, Y., Kariv-Inbal, Z., Halimi, M., Avraham, I., and Gabizon, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 31479–31482). Using Western immunoblots with the anti-prion protein (PrP) 3F4 monoclonal antibody and an anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody, a protease-resistant PrP was reported in the urine of Syrian hamsters and humans with prion disease. Here we have demonstrated that this purportedly “protease-resistant PrP” band in the urine of diseased hamsters is detectable using the anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody in the absence of the 3F4 monoclonal antibody. Mass spectrometric analysis identified an immunoglobulin light chain in the band but found no PrP peptides. No similar band was found in the urine of uninfected hamsters or in brain homogenates from normal or prioninfected hamsters. Moreover, the band in the urine of infected hamsters was not detected using two chimeric human-mouse recombinant anti-PrP antibody fragments followed by an anti-human IgG secondary antibody. Our results indicate that the band detected under previously published conditions is due to the cross-reactivity of the anti-mouse IgG antibody with IgG light chains and possibly heavy chain fragments in urine, but not with PrP. In the prion diseases, a prolonged, asymptomatic incubation period precedes the onset of neurologic dysfunction. At present, a noninvasive test is not available for the presymptomatic diagnosis of prion disease, and thus the report of a test for prions using urine has been of great interest (Shaked, G. M., Shaked, Y., Kariv-Inbal, Z., Halimi, M., Avraham, I., and Gabizon, R. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 31479–31482).

Prions cause neurodegeneration in humans and animals (2Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The human prion diseases can manifest as hereditary, sporadic, and infectious disorders. Much evidence argues that prions causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) 1The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; vCJD, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, disease-causing isoform of PrP; mAb, monoclonal antibody; AP, alkaline phosphatase; PK, proteinase K; Fab, antibody fragment; HuM, human-mouse; MS, mass spectrometry.1The abbreviations used are: BSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy; vCJD, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease; PrP, prion protein; PrPSc, disease-causing isoform of PrP; mAb, monoclonal antibody; AP, alkaline phosphatase; PK, proteinase K; Fab, antibody fragment; HuM, human-mouse; MS, mass spectrometry. have been transferred to humans by ingestion of tainted beef products (3Scott M.R. Will R. Ironside J. Nguyen H.-O.B. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 15137-15142Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 4Will R.G. Cousens S.N. Farrington C.P. Smith P.G. Knight R.S.G. Ironside J.W. Lancet. 1999; 353: 979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The resulting disease in humans has been designated variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), which occurs primarily in teenagers and young adults. Compared with sporadic CJD that accounts for ∼85% of all prion disease in humans, vCJD seems to be caused by a strain of prions that is much more lymphotrophic. Evidence for the lymphotropism of vCJD prions comes from studies of the tonsils and appendix, both of which contain readily measurable levels of the disease-causing isoform (PrPSc) of the prion protein (PrP) (5Will R.G. Alpers M.P. Dormont D. Schonberger L.B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 629-671Google Scholar). The lymphotropism of vCJD prions has raised considerable concern about the safety of the blood supply in Great Britain and led the United States to prohibit blood donations from individuals who have lived in Europe for prolonged periods of time (6Baron H. Safar J. Groth D. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 921-960Google Scholar). Findings that both scrapie and BSE prions in sheep can transmit disease after blood transfusions in sheep are also of importance (7Hunter N. Foster J. Chong A. McCutcheon S. Parnham D. Eaton S. MacKenzie C. Houston F. J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Recently, a 69-year-old man who had received a blood transfusion 6.5 years earlier died of vCJD (8Llewelyn C.A. Hewitt P.E. Knight R.S. Amar K. Cousens S. Mackenzie J. Will R.G. Lancet. 2004; 363: 417-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). The blood donor died of vCJD three years ago. Because of the advanced age of the transfusion recipient, which contrasts with the young age of all other vCJD cases, it has been suggested that this may be the first case of human prion disease transmitted by blood transfusion. The foregoing observations argue for the need for a test for prion infection in both humans and animals when they are still asymptomatic. The report of a protease-resistant PrP molecule in the urine of Syrian hamsters, cattle, and humans with prion disease was met with enthusiasm because it seem to herald a means of detecting prions in asymptomatic livestock and humans, perhaps years before they manifest illness (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy that prion infectivity was not detected in urine. Other approaches to developing antemortem tests include measuring PrPSc in muscle (9Bosque P.J. Ryou C. Telling G. Peretz D.

(April 24, 2001) U. S. Patent 6,221,614 B1Google Scholar). We report here that the Western blot signal of a protease-resistant molecule of ∼33 kDa is present as previously described in the urine of prion-infected hamsters and is absent from the urine of uninfected controls (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Unexpectedly, we found that this ∼33-kDa molecule is not PrP but seems to be composed of IgG light chains. Animals and Inocula—Syrian hamsters (LVG:Lak) were inoculated intracerebrally with Sc237 prions. They were sacrificed after 60–65 days, and their brains were collected and immediately frozen in liquid N2. Urine Collection—Urine from normal and hamsters inoculated with prions 60–65 days earlier was collected overnight in metabolic cages (Rodent Metabolic Cage; Nalgene, Naperville, IL). In the morning, this urine was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min and then dialyzed against 0.85% NaCl with three changes as described (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The dialysis bags were 6000–8000 molecular weight cutoff, either CelluSep T2 (Membrane Filtration Products, Seguin, TX) or Spectra/Por (Spectrum Chemical). After this stage, the samples were aliquoted and kept at –80 °C. Sample Preparation—Each urine sample consisted of 2 ml of dialyzed urine from normal or ill Syrian hamsters. The urine sample was concentrated by methanol precipitation at a ratio of 1:10 (v/v), for 2 h at –20 °C and centrifuged at 2500 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2% Sarkosyl) (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Each sample was divided into two equal parts. One half was digested with proteinase K (PK) (Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 40 μg/ml for 60 min in a water bath at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The other sample was kept as an undigested control. Ten percent (w/v) brain homogenates were prepared from hamsters killed in the terminal stages of disease. The brains were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium chloride (Invitrogen) with 2% Sarkosyl by three 15-s strokes of a PowerGen homogenizer (Fisher Scientific International, Tustin, CA). The homogenate was centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was used for the preparation of the sample. SDS-PAGE/Western Blotting—The urine was analyzed on a 12% SDS-PAGE. We added an equal volume (250 μl) of 2× sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer with 1.5 m urea to each sample. The samples were boiled for 7 min, cleared by centrifugation for 1 min in the tabletop microfuge, and 60 μl was applied to the gel. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 1.5-mm thick, 12% polyacrylamide gel and then electrotransferred to a cellulose nitrate membrane (Hoefer/Pharmacia Biotech, San Francisco, CA). The membrane was blocked for 30 min with 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) at room temperature. As suggested to reduce the background due to non-specific IgG in the urine (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), we performed a second blocking with a mixture of goat anti-rabbit IgG heavy and light chain (H&L) and rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), both diluted 1:3000 in TBST. We developed the blot with the primary monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3F4 (13Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), diluted 1:5000, followed by the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse IgG (H&L) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP) (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted 1:7500 in TBST. The substrate was the Lumi-Phos WB chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The blots were exposed to CL-Xposure film (Pierce). Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry—In-gel digestion was carried out by excising bands from the unstained half of the gel. After reduction and alkylation, gel slices were resuspended in ∼25 μl of 5 ng/μl trypsin (Promega) and digested for 12 h at 37 °C. Peptides were extracted from gel slices using 50% acetonitrile, 2% formic acid; sample volumes were concentrated and resuspended in 0.1% formic acid. The extracted peptides were injected onto a reverse-phase column using a nanoflow (∼350 nl/min) HPLC system (Eldex, Napa, CA). The column effluent was coupled directly via a fused silica capillary transfer line to a LTQ linear ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnegan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ion source. Liquid chromatography runs of 50-min duration were monitored by sequentially recording the precursor scan (MS), a zoom scan to allow for correct charge state assignment (narrow window MS) followed by collision-induced dissociation acquisitions (MS/MS). Automatic gain control was used to define acquisition times, with the average for all three scan types taking ∼1.5 s. Singly charged ions were excluded from collision-induced dissociation selection. Normalized collision energies were employed using nitrogen as the collision gas. For database searches, the Mascot Distiller program (Matrix Science, Boston, MA) was used to create centroided peak lists from the raw spectra. These peak lists were submitted for database searching using an in-house Mascot server (Version 2.0; Matrix Science). In these searches, we allowed mass tolerances of ± 2.0 Da for MS peaks and ± 0.5 Da for MS/MS fragment ions. Samples were searched against all species entries in the UniProt (www.pir.uniprot.org) and nrNCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) databases. The modifications allowed in the searches included oxidation of methionine residues, N-acetylation of proteins, pyroglutamic acid formation at the peptide N termini, and up to two trypsin missed cleavages. Homology searches were carried out using the program MS-Homology (proteinprospector.ucsf.edu, in-house version 4.7). Protease-resistant Proteins in Urine of Hamsters—Urine samples were collected from normal and symptomatic Syrian hamsters. For comparison, we prepared brain homogenates from Syrian hamsters dying of prion disease. We evaluated these samples in parallel on a Western blot, which was developed with the 3F4 mAb (13Kascsak R.J. Rubenstein R. Merz P.A. Tonna-DeMasi M. Fersko R. Carp R.I. Wisniewski H.M. Diringer H. J. Virol. 1987; 61: 3688-3693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by immunostaining with a goat anti-mouse IgG-AP secondary antibody (Fig. 1A). A control gel was probed with only the secondary antibody (Fig. 1B). At 29 kDa, a protease-sensitive band was present in the normal urine (Fig. 1A, lane 1), whereas urine from ill hamsters had two strong bands, at 29 and 33 kDa (Fig. 1A, lane 2). Although the 29-kDa band in the urine of ill hamsters was protease-sensitive like that in normal urine, it is unclear if the 33-kDa band is resistant to digestion. The 33-kDa band seen after digestion (Fig. 1A, lane 2) is narrower than the band before digestion, indicating that it is less heterogeneous. Possibly, both the 33-kDa band seen after digestion and the faint 34-kDa band above it are generated from larger proteins during limited proteolysis. Brain homogenates from ill hamsters presented the typical pattern with the characteristic shift in molecular mass after limited proteolysis (Fig. 1A, lane 3). Surprisingly, the same signals were detected on the control blot that stained with only the secondary antibody (Fig. 1B). The protease-sensitive, 29-kDa band and the protease-resistant 33-kDa band were found in the urine of both normal and diseased hamsters with the secondary antibody alone. In contrast, we detected neither full-length PrPSc nor N-terminally truncated PrPSc (PrP 27–30) in diseased brain homogenates subjected to limited PK digestion using the secondary antibody alone (Fig. 1B, lane 6). When we developed the Western blot with the goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, the same pattern was observed, with a weaker signal corresponding to the 33-kDa band (Fig. 1C). This was likely due to the low concentration of antigen in the urine sample and the lower sensitivity of the horseradish peroxidase system. PrP Signals Were Not Detected Using Recombinant Fabs That Bind PrP—To characterize the 33-kDa band detected in the urine of ill hamsters, a Western blot was developed with two antibody fragments (Fab) known to react avidly with Syrian hamster PrP. These mouse Fabs were isolated by phage display (14Williamson R.A. Peretz D. Pinilla C. Ball H. Bastidas R.B. Rozenshteyn R. Houghten R.A. Prusiner S.B. Burton D.R. J.

Both Fabs were detected with an anti-human IgG secondary antibody. HuM-P recognized PrPSc in hamster brain homogenates but did not detect PrP in any of the urine samples (Fig. 2A, left panel). Similarly, the Fab HuM-D18 did not detect any PrP in the urine samples but clearly recognized PrPSc in brain homogenates (Fig. 2B, left panel). In contrast to the results presented in Fig. 1B, the goat anti-human IgG secondary antibody alone did not detect any macromolecules in the urine of hamsters (Fig. 2, A and B, right panels). Mass Spectrometric Identification of κ Light Chain Peptides—Urine from ill hamsters was digested with PK (40 μg/ml) for 60 min at 37 °C. The digested sample was loaded into two lanes on an SDS-PAGE gel. One lane was analyzed by Western blotting to establish approximate molecular mass. At ∼33 kDa in an unstained parallel lane, a 20-mm segment was excised. From this segment, 10 equal bands were cut and numbered from 1 to 10 from lowest to highest molecular mass (bottom to top of the gel segment). These 10 samples were placed in individual tubes and subjected to in-gel reduction, alkylation, and digestion with trypsin. The 10 samples were sequentially analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry, resulting in ∼5000 collision-induced dissociation sequence spectra that were submitted for protein database searching. At this time, the databases used for these searches contain no hamster immunoglobulin sequences; therefore, any matches are from completely homologous peptide sequences of other species. Four peptides extracted from band 4 were identified as belonging to immunoglobulin light chain from various species. Two of the spectra that gave unambiguous identifications for the peptides LLIYWASTR and DSTYSLSSTLTLTK are shown in Fig. 3. To confirm that the peptide sequence is unique to the immunoglobulin κ chain, these peptides were submitted to a protein homology database search. With no species specified and allowing for isoleucine/leucine substitutions, 501 (Ile → Leu) and 1 (Leu → Ile) peptides from the nrNCBI database were found to match the two sequences. All peptides appeared to be derived from immunoglobulin light chains from various species. None of the database searches or manual data analysis resulted in the identification of any PrP peptides even when using very low statistical significance threshold criteria (p < 0.5). The development of antemortem tests for prion diseases is of utmost importance. Such tests would have immediate application in the routine testing of human blood and the testing of livestock, such as cattle and sheep, as well as free-ranging animals, including deer and elk. Thus, the report of a protease-resistant form of PrP in the urine of Syrian hamsters, cattle, and humans with prion disease was met with considerable enthusiasm (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Interestingly, no prion infectivity could be recovered from the urine of Syrian hamsters infected with Sc237 prions (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Multiple attempts to identify the protease-resistant form of PrP reported to be present in urine of animals and humans with prion disease (1Shaked G.M. Shaked Y. Kariv-Inbal Z. Halimi M. Avraham I. Gabizon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31479-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were initially judged to be reproducible in our studies of urine collected from prion-infected Syrian hamsters. Western blots developed with the anti-PrP 3F4 mAb showed the presence of a PK-resistant macromolecule in the urine of ill hamsters. However, when we analyzed the Western blot with the anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody alone, we detected the same signal. This indicates that the band detected on Western blot was not PrP as initially thought but is a protein or another macromolecule that shares epitopes with mouse IgG. That the band is likely to be mouse IgG is supported by additional studies in which an anti-human IgG secondary antibody was used and no signal was detected. We also found no immunoreactivity with the anti-human IgG secondary antibody, which we used for the detection of two different anti-PrP recombinant HuM chimeric antibodies. Among all the antibodies used in our studies, only the anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody detected a macromolecule in the urine of prion-infected hamsters. This finding argues for cross-reactivity with a non-PrP hamster antigen. Furthermore, we found by means of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry that this band contains immunoglobulin light chain fragments. We suggest that this band might be Bence Jones protein. The Bence Jones protein is a mixture of aggregated κ and λ light chains from immunoglobulins (19Solomon A. N. Engl. J. Med. 1976; 294: 17-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The molecular mass of the Bence Jones protein varies from low molecular mass fragments to 22-kDa monomers or 44-kDa dimers (20Graziani M.S. Merlini G. Clin. Chem. 2001; 47: 2069-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). It has been documented that the Bence Jones proteins or light chain immunoglobulins form amyloid structures, which can be stained with Congo red (21Bourne P.C. Ramsland P.A. Shan L. Fan Z.C. DeWitt C.R. Shultz B.B. Terzyan S.S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Guddat L.W. Edmundson A.B. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Polymerization of such proteins into amyloid might explain the apparent protease-resistance of these urinary proteins. It is unclear why Bence Jones proteins should accumulate in the urine of humans, cattle, and rodents infected with prions. Whether prions cause a nephrotic syndrome or central nervous system damage leading to inactivity that, in turn, results in a nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. The report of a protease-resistant PrP in urine prompted speculation that urine may carry infectious prions and that horizontal transmission of scrapie in flocks or chronic wasting disease in herds of deer may have occurred through prion contamination of pastures via urine (22Miller M.W.

Shinagawa M. Prusiner S.B. Prion Biology and Diseases. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2004: 545-594Google Scholar). To date, no one has convincingly identified prions in urine, but a much more likely source of prions is fecal matter. Miyazawa et al. (24Miyazawa K. Shiga Y. Matsuzaki M. Takeda A. Itoyama Y. Ann. Neurol. 2002; 52: S54Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) reported finding protease-resistant PrP in urine of seven of nine CJD patients examined. Possibly, these investigators did not perform control studies in which they omitted the primary anti-PrP antibody. Furukawa et al. (25, Furukawa, H., Shirabe, S., and Niwa, M. (2003) Diagnostic Usefulness of Urine Protein Analysis in Prion Diseases, XV International Congress of Neuropathology, Turin, Italy, September 14–18, 2003, p. 343T, International Society of Neuropathology and the Italian Association of Neuropathology, Florence, ItalyGoogle Scholar) reported their experience with patients suffering from CJD, Alzheimer's disease, and non-dementing disorders as well as healthy controls. Twenty-nine of 38 CJD patients had protease-resistant IgG bands in urine, similar to results reported here for urine of Syrian hamsters inoculated with prions; 2 of 19 non-demented patients were also positive. None of the Alzheimer's disease patients (n = 20) and healthy controls (n = 19) exhibited protease-resistant IgG bands in urine. Those findings and these reported here provide a compelling argument that if urine contains any protease-resistant PrP, then the levels must be quite low. Moreover, it seems doubtful that measuring protease-resistant IgG bands in urine will form the basis for a useful diagnostic test for prion disease. Such measurements will be fraught with all the difficulties encountered by medical investigators who have attempted to use elevated levels of the stress protein 14–3-3 in cerebrospinal fluid as a diagnostic marker for prion disease (5Will R.G.

In the mouse, SNF2H is expressed ubiquitously, whereas SNF2L expression is limited to the brain and gonadal tissue. This pattern of SNF2L expression suggests a critical role for SNF2L in neuronal physiology. Indeed, SNF2L was shown to promote neurite outgrowth as well as regulate the human engrailed homeotic genes, important regulators of brain development.

SNF2L+13 retains the ability to incorporate into multiprotein complexes; however, it is devoid of enzymatic activity. Most interestingly, unlike mouse SNF2L, human SNF2L is expressed ubiquitously, and regulation is mediated by isoform variation.

Thus, like the mouse, active human SNF2L is limited to neurons and a few other tissues. The mobilization of chromatin is a prerequisite for many nuclear processes requiring access to DNA. Some of these processes include activation (1Agalioti T. Chen G. Thanos D. Cell. 2002; 111: 381-392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar) and repression of transcription (2Battaglioli E. Andres M.E. Rose D.W. Chenoweth J.G. Rosenfeld M.G.

Genet. 2002; 32: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and others. This mobilization of nucleosomes, termed chromatin remodeling, is catalyzed by the superfamily of ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers, molecular machines that couple the energy released with ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome mobilization (5Havas K. Whitehouse I. Owen-Hughes T. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2001; 58: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In vitro, chromatin remodelers have been characterized by their ability to slide nucleosomes, assemble chromatin, or hydrolyze ATP in a DNA- or nucleosome-dependent manner (6Vignali M. Hassan A.H. Neely K.E. Workman J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1899-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). As a superfamily, chromatin remodelers are defined structurally by the presence of an SNF2 domain, which renders the protein catalytically active. The SNF2 domain is a helicase-like region containing the seven conserved motifs found in classical helicases, including a nucleotide-binding sequence. The SNF2 domain is remarkably conserved with a low tolerance for primary sequence variability. This is likely the consequence of a highly defined three-dimensional structural topology forming the catalytic domain. The imitation switch (ISWI) 1The abbreviations used are: ISWI, imitation switch; BPTF, bromodomain PHD transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription; AP, alkaline phosphatase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; RyR3, ryanodine receptor; NURF, nucleosome remodeling factor; hNURF, human NURF; r, recombinant; IP, immunoprecipitation.1The abbreviations used are: ISWI, imitation switch; BPTF, bromodomain PHD transcription factor; RT, reverse transcription; AP, alkaline phosphatase; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; RyR3, ryanodine receptor; NURF, nucleosome remodeling factor; hNURF, human NURF; r, recombinant; IP, immunoprecipitation. proteins compose one family of chromatin remodelers conserved from budding yeast to humans. The ISWI proteins are defined by the presence of the SNF2 helicase and two SANT domains at their C termini (7Varga-Weisz P. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3076-3085Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). They are capable of remodeling and spacing chromatin in vitro. In metazoans, ISWI proteins have been isolated in a variety of multiprotein complexes including Williams syndrome transcription factor-related chromatin remodeling factor (8Bochar D.A. Savard J.

Nature. 2002; 418: 994-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although the enzymatic activities of these complexes are similar in vitro,itis presumed that in vivo the ISWI-binding partners play a regulatory role in the complex. They appear to direct the ISWI enzyme to specific regions of the genome in a cell cycle-dependent manner (4Collins N. Poot R.A. Kukimoto I. Garcia-Jimenez C. Dellaire G. Varga-Weisz P.D. Nat. Genet. 2002; 32: 627-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 9Bozhenok L. Wade P.A. Varga-Weisz P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mammalian genomes encode two ISWI orthologs, SNF2H and SNF2L. The two mammalian ISWI proteins have high sequence homology to each other with ∼86% identity. In mouse, the role of SNF2L in neuronal development is suggested by the expression patterns of the two mammalian ISWI proteins. Mouse SNF2H is expressed ubiquitously, whereas SNF2L expression is restricted to the central nervous system and gonadal tissue. The two proteins also exhibit temporal differences in their expression. For example, in neurons SNF2H is expressed in actively dividing embryonic neurons, whereas SNF2L is highly expressed in differentiated postmitotic adult neurons (16Lazzaro M.A. Picketts D.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, ectopic expression of wt-SNF2L results in neurite outgrowth in a tissue culture model system. Neurite outgrowth marks a developmental switch from dividing neuroblasts to terminally differentiated neurons. This change in cell morphology is dependent on the chromatin remodeling activity of SNF2L because a SNF2L-K213R enzymatically dead mutant inhibits neurite outgrowth (10Barak O. Lazzaro M.A. Speicher D.W. Picketts D.J. Shiekhattar R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6089-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Differences between the two proteins are also suggested by their biochemistry. SNF2H is the catalytic subunit of most of the known ISWI complexes isolated in mammals including WCRF/hACF, chromatin accessibility complex, nucleolar remodeling complex, remodeling and spacing factor, and SNF2H-cohesin (8Bochar D.A. Savard J. Wang W. Lafleur D.W. Moore P. Cote J. Shiekhattar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1038-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 12Strohner R. Nemeth A. Jansa P.

Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 6759-6768Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Recently, the first SNF2L-associated complex was isolated to homogeneity with a subunit composition reminiscent of the Drosophila NURF complex (10Barak O. Lazzaro M.A. Speicher D.W. Picketts D.J. Shiekhattar R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6089-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Termed human NURF (hNURF), this novel human chromatin remodeling complex plays an important role in neuronal physiology. hNURF was shown to regulate the human engrailed (En) genes, which were implicated in brain development. Mice lacking en-1 and/or en-2 display a severe mid-hindbrain malformation and cerebellar dysgenesis (18Kuemerle B. Zanjani H. Joyner A. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7881-7889Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another factor relating the hNURF complex to neuronal physiology is its large subunit, bromodomain PHD transcription factor (BPTF). An isoform of BPTF, called FAC1, was isolated in a screen for proteins accumulating in senile plaques, a pathognomonic feature of Alzheimer's disease, and BPTF was later found to be highly expressed in other neuropathologies (19Bowser R. Giambrone A. Davies P. Dev. Neurosci. 1995; 17: 20-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 20Mu X. Springer J.E. Bowser R. Exp. Neurol. 1997; 146: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 21Jordan-Sciutto K. Dragich J. Walcott D. Bowser R. Neuropathol. Appl. Neurobiol. 1998; 24: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). In addition, BPTF localizes to 17q24, a chromosomal locus employed as a prognostic factor for neuroblastoma progression (22Lastowska M. Van Roy N. Bown N. Speleman F. Roberts P. Lunec J. Strachan T. Pearson A.D. Jackson M.S. Med. Pediatr. Oncol. 2001; 36: 20-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of mRNA splicing by Sharp and co-workers (23Berget S.M. Sharp P.A. Brookhaven Symp. Biol. 1977; 29: 332-344Google Scholar), alternative splicing has become a well established form of regulation of protein expression. Alternative splicing is ascribed with creating the enormous genomic diversity observed in higher eukaryotes. One functional consequence of alternative splicing is the generation of regulatory inactive isoforms of proteins. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) β isoform, lacking the C-terminal ligand binding domain, inhibits the active GR α isoform, possibly through the formation of an inactive heterodimeric complex (24Oakley R.H. Jewell C.M. Yudt M.R. Bofetiado D.M. Cidlowski J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27857-27866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Likewise, a splice variant of the ryanodine receptor (RyR3) binds to wild type RyR3 and forms a heteromeric channel with reduced calcium sensitivity (25Jiang D. Xiao B. Li X. Chen S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4763-4769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). With regard to splice variant regulation of enzymatic activity, an isoform variant of the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK1) was shown to include a 30-amino acid insertion resulting in a loss of kinase activity (26Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29037-29044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here we report the first null isoform of a chromatin-remodeling enzyme. This isoform is a splice variant of human SNF2L, which we call SNF2L+13. SNF2L+13 includes a nonconserved exon 13 within the evolutionarily and highly conserved catalytic core domain of SNF2L. We show that the recombinant SNF2L+13 lacks both ATPase and chromatin remodeling activities in vitro. In vivo, SNF2L+13 retains the ability to form high molecular weight multiprotein complexes; however, these complexes are enzymatically inactive. Whereas mouse SNF2L expression is restricted to brain and gonadal tissue, human SNF2L is expressed ubiquitously. Most interestingly, the inactive SNF2L+13 isoform is expressed in non-neuronal tissue, thus ensuring that, similar to the mouse, active human SNF2L is found exclusively in brain and a few other tissues. Therefore, mice and humans have evolved two very different approaches to brain-specific expression of the same chromatin remodeler. Cell Culture and Transfections—HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and antibiotics and grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. SF9 insect cells were maintained in SF-900 (Invitrogen) supplemented with l-glutamine and baculobiotics (Invitrogen) and grown at room temperature. HEK293 cells were transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For stable cell line generation, cells were cotransfected with cDNA of choice along with a puromycin-expressing plasmid for 48 h and transferred to selective media, complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with puromycin (2.5 μg ml-1). Puromycin-resistant colonies were selected, amplified, and screened for cDNA expression. Immunoblot Analysis and Antibodies—Proteins were separated by 4–12% gradient Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes in transfer buffer (50 mm Tris, 380 mm glycine, and 10% methanol). Blots were probed with primary antibodies in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.15% Tween 20, followed by alkaline phosphatase (AP)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Promega). All blots were visualized as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 285-318Google Scholar). Anti-SNF2L monoclonal antibodies were raised against a recombinant glutathione S-transferase-fused to the N terminus of human SNF2L protein. Anti-exon 13 antibodies were raised against a keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptide corresponding to exon 13 of human SNF2L. Polyclonal antibodies were affinity-purified using the peptide as described (27Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Anti-RbAP48 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Anti-RbAP46 and anti-RbAP46 polyclonal antibodies were purchased from Oncogene. Purification of SNF2L-associated Complexes—Nuclear extract was prepared from stable WT-SNF2L or SNF2L+13 HEK293 cells according to protocol published previously (28Dignam J.D.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) by using purified HeLa cell histones resulting in ∼50% saturation leading to a 1:1 ratio of cut:uncut DNA with SalI digestion alone lacking remodeler. 20-μl reactions containing 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.9), 125 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 100 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 0.5 μl of HC-SalI (New England Biolabs), 0.l pmol of nucleosomal array (∼10,000–50,000 cpm) along with purified proteins or mock elutions, where indicated, were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. DNA array was then deproteinated by phenol chloroform extraction. Aqueous fractions containing DNA were supplemented with DNA sample buffer followed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Gel was placed on a sheet of DE81 chromatography paper (Whatman) and dried by vacuum for 2 h at 60 °C. Dried gel was then analyzed by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences), and bands were quantified by densitometric analysis (29Logie C. Peterson C.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6772-6782Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Size Exclusion Chromatography—Recombinant FLAG-SNF2L+13 or stable cell line immunoprecipitations were fractionated by using a Bio-Sil Sec400 gel filtration column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated in BC-500 supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. 0.3-ml fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot for SNF2L. ATPase Assays—Measurement of ATPase activity was performed in 10-μl reactions under the following conditions: 20 mm Tris-Cl, 60 mm KCl, 4% glycerol, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm cold ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 1 pmol of each remodeling enzyme. Where indicated, reaction was supplemented with 50 ng of naked DNA or nucleosomes. Reactions were performed at 30 °C for 1 h. Free phosphate and ATP were separated by TLC on PEI-cellulose plates (J. T. Baker Inc.). 1 μl of reaction was spotted on a plate, and TLC was carried out in 1 m formic acid, 0.5 m LiCl. Plates were then allowed to dry and were visualized by exposure to PhosphorImager cassette (Amersham Biosciences) for densitometric analysis or film (Eastman Kodak). Splice Variant PCR Assay—Splice variant analysis was performed by using RT-PCR of tissue-specific RNAs (Clontech). Total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA by random priming using random decamers (Ambion) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequent PCRs were performed by using specific primers and Taq polymerase (Roche Applied Science). Primer set A annealed to DNA flanking exon 13 resulting in faster or slower migrating bands depending on presence of exon 13: setA-For 5′-TTTGGAAGATTATTGCATGTGGC-3′ setA-Rev 5′-TTGTAGATCAACCTGTGGGTTCC-3′. Primer set B annealed to exon 13 and exon 12 resulting in an amplicon only in tissues expressing the exon 13 splice variant: setB-For 5′-CTTCTGGCAAGATGGACAAGATG-3′ setB-Rev 5′-CTTTGACCCAGAAATTCCACTTC-3′. PCR products were analyzed by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ethidium bromide visualization of bands. Sequence confirmation of bands was performed by gel extraction of band (Qiagen), TA cloning of band into the PCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and sequencing of vector inserts using M13-forward and M13-reverse sequencing primers. Expression and Purification of Recombinant SNF2L and SNF2H—FLAG-WT-SNF2L and FLAG-SNF2+13 were cloned into pBacPak (Clontech) baculovirus expression vectors. FLAG-SNF2H was cloned into the pBacnBlue (Invitrogen) expression vector. Viruses expressing the recombinant ISWI proteins were generated according to the manufacturer's protocol. For protein expression, high titer virus (∼108 plaque-forming units) was used to infect adherent SF9 cells at an multiplicity of infection of 10. 72 h post-infection, cells were raised in Insect lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100 (pH 7.8)), subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle, and Dounce-homogenized. Cell debris was pelleted, and the supernatant was subjected to overnight immunoprecipitation with M2-anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma). Beads were washed in three consecutive 10 column volume washes containing BC500 supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, BC750 supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and BC1000 supplemented with 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Finally beads were raised in BC-100 and subjected to five 1-column volume elutions using BC100 supplemented with 400 μg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma). Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining. In Silico Identification of a Novel Human SNF2L Splice Variant—Human SNF2L (GenBank™ accession number NP_620604) was subjected to alignment with other ISWI family members. We compared the amino acid sequences from an evolutionarily diverse cross-section of eukaryotic ISWI proteins including those from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Xenopus laevis, mouse, and a second human ISWI ortholog, SNF2H. The conserved regions of the ISWI proteins aligned as expected (data not shown) including the SNF2 helicase and SANT domains. Most interestingly, we identified a 12-amino acid sequence present in human SNF2L but absent in the other ISWI orthologs (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence immediately upstream and downstream to the insertion retained high homology with the sequences from the other ISWI family proteins. We investigated the genomic DNA encoding human SNF2L, and we identified the exonic sequences corresponding to the nonhomologous insertion and the homologous flanking regions. The insertion is encoded by a single, 36-bp exon corresponding to exon 13 of human SNF2L. The flanking homologous regions of the SNF2L open reading frame reflected exons 12 and 14. The highly conserved, catalytically active SNF2 helicase is encoded by exons 6–15 (Fig. 1B). Exon 13 incorporation disrupts the primary sequence of the helicase domain, suggesting a possible effect on the enzymatic activity of SNF2L. We subjected the region surrounding exon 13 to the Jpred secondary structure prediction algorithm (www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/~www-jpred/) (30Cuff J.A. Barton G.J. Proteins. 2000; 40: 502-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Jpred generates a secondary structure prediction based on an alignment of multiple sequences similar to the query sequence, SNF2L in this case. Most interestingly, Jpred predicted a conserved 11-amino acid α-helix composed of exons 12 and 14 of SNF2L. This α-helix is disrupted upon inclusion of exon 13 (Fig. 1A). This structural compromise by exon 13 supports the hypothesis that the SNF2L+13 isoform may have reduced or even absent enzymatic activity. To confirm further that exon 13 was a bona fide exon, we analyzed the SNF2L putative intron-exon boundary genomic sequence using the Splice Proximal Check program (www.ebi.ac.uk/~thanaraj/SpliceProximalCheck.html). Splice Proximal Check utilizes a discrete set of rules to determine whether a given sequence is a “false site” or a “possible true site” (31Thanaraj T.A. Clark F. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2581-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The program confirmed that the DNA immediately 5′ and 3′ to exon 13 are “possible true” splice sites. Indeed, upon sequence inspection, the introns-exon boundaries upstream and downstream of exon 13 contain the standard GT-AG consensus splice sequences (Fig. 1C). The inclusion of exon 13 into a highly conserved region of SNF2L may represent a regulatory splicing event occurring during SNF2L mRNA maturation. As such, we would expect that within the set of total human transcripts, both isoforms of SNF2L should be expressed. An approximation of total human transcripts is the expressed sequence tag (EST) data base. We performed BLAST analysis on the SNF2L mRNA against the EST data base to identify cDNA variants either incorporating or excluding exon 13. As predicted, sequences encoding both SNF2L isoforms are represented within the EST data base (data not shown). The presence of both isoforms further supports our hypothesis that exon 13 may act as a cis-acting regulatory element in human SNF2L, possibly regulating its enzymatic activity. A PCR-based Splice Variant Assay—We next asked whether the in silico data could be recapitulated in vivo. We established a PCR-based method for differentiating the transcripts encoding the two isoforms. By using a set of primers (set A) annealing to exons 12 and 14 and another set (set B) annealing to exons 12 and 13 (Fig. 2A), we predicted that we would be able to differentiate the two isoforms by performing RT-PCR on total RNA. We confirmed the validity of this assay by using cDNA constructs encoding either wt-SNF2L (the SNF2L open reading frame lacking exon 13) or SN2L+13 (the SNF2L open reading frame containing exon 13). By using the set A primers, we note a faster and slower migrating PCR product corresponding to the absence or presence of exon 13, respectively (Fig. 2B, top panel). The set B primers could only amplify a DNA product with the SNF2L+13 cDNA as template (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). We concluded that the PCR-based assay would allow us to differentiate the two isoforms in vivo. In Vivo Confirmation of a Tissue-specific Exon 13 Splice Variant—We examined total RNA from normal human tissue using the PCR-based spliced variant assay. Previous analysis suggests that in mouse SNF2L is expressed primarily in brain as well as gonadal tissue (16Lazzaro M.A. Picketts D.J. J. Neurochem. 2001; 77: 1145-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We predicted a similar expression pattern in human tissues. Tissue-specific human RNA was subjected to reverse transcription followed by conventional PCR by using the primers from set A, set B, and a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase loading control primer set. By using set A, we were able to visualize two differentially migrating bands corresponding to the two exon 13 splice variants (Fig. 2C, top panel). Representative bands were extracted and sequenced to confirm the presence or absence of the exon 13 splice variant (data not shown). Indeed, the sequence corresponded to that predicted for each amplicon with the slower migrating band including the exon 13 sequences, and the faster migrating band excluding exon 13. The set B primers, which anneal to exon 13, further confirm the results of set A (Fig. 2C, middle panel). Tissues containing a prominent amplicon using set B correlate well with tissues generating slower migrating bands using set A. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase controls (Fig. 2C, bottom panel) demonstrated that similar quantities of total RNA were subjected to amplification from the various human tissues. Contrary to our predictions, these experiments suggested that human SNF2L appeared to have a broad expression pattern consistent with a ubiquitously expressed gene. All tissues inspected exhibit SNF2L transcripts; however, it is noteworthy that only one of the splice variants predominates in each tissue. For example, lung expresses a SNF2L+13 variant, whereas brain expresses the wt-SNF2L variant (Fig. 2C). The tissue specificity of this splice variant led us to ask whether exon 13 regulates the enzymatic activity of SNF2L. Did most tissues express a null isoform of SNF2L, whereas brain expressed the active SNF2L? This would suggest that using alternative splicing, functional human SNF2L recapitulates the brain-specific mouse expression pattern. Detection of Endogenous SNF2L+13 Protein—Our experiments identified endogenous mRNA transcripts corresponding to both the wt-SNF2L and SNF2L+13 isoforms. However, we wanted to ensure that both isoforms are indeed translated into SNF2L protein. To this end, we generated antibodies against the SNF2L+13 isoform by inoculating rabbits with a peptide corresponding to the exon 13 sequence. The antibodies were subsequently purified by immunoaffinity chromatography by using an exon 13 peptide affinity column. To test the specificity of the antibodies, we subjected purified recombinant isoforms of SNF2L (Fig. 3, lanes 1 and 2) as well as HEK293 transfected and immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged isoforms of SNF2L (Fig. 3, lanes 3 and 4) to immunoblot with the exon 13 and total SNF2L antibodies. The antibodies demonstrated exquisite specificity detecting only the SNF2L+13 isoforms and not wt-SNF2L. We then attempted to detect endogenous SNF2L+13 using the exon 13 antibodies. To do this, we electrophoresed hNURF purified from stably expressing FLAG-BPTF HEK293 cells. We demonstrated previously that FLAG-BPTF associates with endogenous SNF2L and RbAP46/48 (10Barak O. Lazzaro M.A. Speicher D.W. Picketts D.J. Shiekhattar R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6089-6100Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). By using RT-PCR, we found that HEK293 cells express a low amount of the SNF2L+13 isoform (data not shown). Consistent with this, the exon 13 antibodies detected a small amount of SNF2L+13 protein in the purified hNURF (Fig. 3, lane 5). We conclude that the SNF2L+13 transcript is indeed translated into protein. Exon 13 Severely Affects SNF2L ATPase Activity—To answer the question of whether exon 13 affects SNF2L enzymatic activity, we evaluated the two SNF2L splice variants for ATPase activity. To this end we expressed and purified the two splice variants of recombinant full-length SNF2L (rSNF2L) using a baculovirus expression system. As a control, we generated a recombinant SNF2H (rSNF2H), the second human ISWI protein. Following stringent washes, we were able to isolate electrophoretically pure recombinant protein, which we analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4A). T"

SCF also synergizes with a variety of growth factors, including those binding members of the cytokine receptor superfamily. The mechanisms mediating this synergy remain to be defined. The present study investigates both structural and biochemical cross-talk between c-Kit and the receptor for granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). We have found that c-Kit forms a complex with the β-chain of the GM-CSF receptor, and this interaction involves the first part of the c-Kit kinase domain. Although inhibition of c-Kit kinase activity completely blocked SCF-induced proliferation, there was still greater than additive growth induced by SCF in combination with GM-CSF. In contrast, an inhibitory antibody against the extracellular domain of c-Kit (K-27) completely inhibited growth in response to SCF alone or in combination with GM-CSF. These results support a kinase-independent component of the synergistic growth induced by SCF and GM-CSF that may relate to interaction of these receptors. It is also clear that a significant part of the synergistic growth is dependent of c-Kit kinase activity. Although synergistic increases in phosphorylation of c-Kit and the β-chain of the GM-CSF receptor were not observed, SCF and GM-CSF in combination prolonged the duration of Erk1/2 phosphorylation in a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent manner. Consistent with these findings, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is synergistically activated by SCF and GM-CSF together.

Hence, c-Kit makes both kinase-independent and -dependent contributions to the proliferative synergy induced by SCF in combination with GM-CSF. The mechanisms mediating hematopoiesis are not fully understood but require interactions between a wide array of cell surface receptors with growth factors and cytokines. Two receptor families important for hematopoiesis are the cytokine receptor superfamily and the receptor tyrosine kinase superfamily. Ligands for the cytokine receptors include granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SCF, stem cell factor; IL-3, interleukin-3; IL-5, interleukin-5; Epo, erythropoietin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras binding domain; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; Mek, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum.1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSF, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor; SCF, stem cell factor; IL-3, interleukin-3; IL-5, interleukin-5; Epo, erythropoietin; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RBD, Ras binding domain; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; Stat, signal transducers and activators of transcription; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; PI, phosphatidylinositol; Mek, MAP kinase/ERK kinase; FCS, fetal calf serum. interleukin-3 (IL-3), and erythropoietin (Epo). The receptor for human GM-CSF is comprised of a GM-CSF-specific α-chain and a β-chain shared with the receptors for IL-3 and IL-5 (1Gearing D.P. King J.A. Gough N.M. Nicola N.A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3667-3676Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 2Hayashida K. Kitamura T. Gorman D.M. Arai K. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9655-9659Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Upon GM-CSF stimulation the α- and β-chains cluster together, bringing associated cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases close together resulting in activation and subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-chain. Stem cell factor (SCF) binds to the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit leading to its homodimerization and autophosphorylation (3Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Zsebo K.M. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4121-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated tyrosine residues, in c-Kit and the β-chain, function as docking sites for signal transduction molecules with SH2 domains. The SH2 domain is a stretch of ∼100 amino acids that binds phosphorylated tyrosine residues in an amino acid sequence context-dependent manner (4Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Previous studies have suggested that c-Kit may play a role in responses mediated by IL-3 and GM-CSF. Certain c-Kit inhibitory antibodies reduce colony formation induced by GM-CSF (5Ashman L.K. Cambareri A.C. Eglinton J.M. Leuk. Res. 1990; 14: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Further, a decrease in IL-3-induced proliferation was seen after treatment of CD34+ bone marrow progenitors with antisense oligonucleotides against c-Kit (6Catlett J.P. Leftwich J.A. Westin E.H. Grant S. Huff T.F. Blood. 1991; 78: 3186-3191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The A/J mice strain do not express the α-chain of the IL-3 receptor and hence do not respond well to IL-3 as a single factor (7Leslie K.B. Jalbert S. Orban P. Welham M. Duronio V. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1996; 87: 3186-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Ichihara M. Hara T. Takagi M. Cho L.C. Gorman D.M. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 939-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, these mice still respond synergistically to IL-3 in combination with SCF. It has been shown that the Epo receptor and c-Kit form a physical complex that allows trans-phosphorylation to occur, and this has been suggested to play an important role in erythroid colony formation (9Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 10Wu H. Klingmuller U. Acurio A. Hsiao J.G. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1806-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies support a role for c-Kit in cytokine signaling. Thus, SCF synergizes with ligands for the cytokine receptor superfamily members (11McNiece I.K. Langley K.E. Zsebo K.M. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 226-231PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these events remain to be established. Because the in vivo effects of SCF are mediated primarily in combination with other factors, it is vital to have a detailed understanding of this process. Synergistic activation of early signal transduction pathways, including both the Erks and Stat proteins, has been reported (12O'Farrell A.M. Ichihara M. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. Blood. 1996; 87: 3655-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pearson M.A. O'Farrell A.M. Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Heyworth C.M.

However, there are a lot of inconsistent results that may relate to variations in experimental procedures and/or the lineage and differentiation state of the cells used as model systems. Information concerning mechanisms mediating synergistic proliferation is valuable for designing means for optimal in vitro expansion of primitive hematopoietic stem- and progenitor cells as well as for other therapeutic uses. In the search for a molecular mechanism behind the synergy between SCF and GM-CSF we found that c-Kit and the β-chain form a complex. Several lines of evidence suggest this complex plays a structural role in synergy: 1) SCF in combination with GM-CSF induced greater than additive proliferation in the presence of a c-Kit kinase inhibitor, and 2) an antibody specific for a portion of the c-Kit extracellular domain reduced proliferation in response to SCF and GM-CSF, both alone and in combination. However, from our results it is clear that a large part of the synergy is dependent on c-Kit enzymatic activity. SCF and GM-CSF in combination induces a sustained phosphorylation of proteins in the MAP kinase pathway, and this correlated with synergistic activation of PI 3-kinase. In contrast, activation of the MAP kinases Erk1/2 by SCF and GM-CSF as single factors does not require PI 3-kinase activity. Pharmacological inhibition of Mek1/2 partially reduced synergistic proliferation. Thus, the Erk cascade contributes to the proliferative response by these factors. In conclusion, multiple mechanisms contribute to synergistic growth induced by SCF and GM-CSF. Antibodies and Inhibitors—Antibodies specific for phosphorylated Mek1/2 (#9121), Erk1/2 (#9106), and pTyr719-Kit (#3391) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Antibodies recognizing c-Kit (sc-168) and the GM-CSF receptor β-chain (sc-678) and phosphotyrosine (sc-7020) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Pan-Ras antibody (05–516) and GST-Raf-RBD (14–278) were from Upstate Biotechnologies (Lake Placid, NY). The PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin was from Sigma, whereas LY294002, PD98059, and AG1296 were from Calbiochem. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse/rabbit IgG was from Cell Signaling Technology. Protein concentration assay reagents were from Pierce. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagent was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cell Lines—The growth factor-dependent megakaryoblastic cell line MO7e was maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (HyClone, Salt Lake City, UT), 1% penicillin, streptomycin, and glutamine (Invitrogen), and 50 ng/ml human SCF (PeproTech Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ), and 5 ng/ml human GM-CSF (PeproTech Inc.). Cell Proliferation Assays—For [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, cells were washed twice with RPMI and resuspended in RPMI plus 10% FCS at 105 cells/ml. Then 104 cells were seeded in each well of a 96-well plate. In the cases were cells were treated with PD98059 (10 μm), AG1296 (5 μm), wortmannin (100 nm), LY294002 (10 μm), or K-27 antibody (5 μg/ml), they were preincubated for 30 min before addition of growth factors. This was followed by the addition of 100 μl of media with or without human SCF at 50 ng/ml and human GM-CSF at 5 ng/ml and inhibitors as indicated. Cells were incubated for 48 h, and then 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine was added to each well. The plate was incubated for 5 h and harvested with a cell harvester (Mach II M, Wallac, Gaithersburg, MD), and [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Immunoprecipitation, Total Cell Lysates, and Immunoblotting— Cells were pelleted and lysed at 107/ml with ice-cold lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris base, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 30 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4) and one tablet Complete inhibitor mixture per 50 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 14,000 rpm. c-Kit or the GM-CSF receptor β-chain was immunoprecipitated from 1 mg of cleared lysate with 2 μg of antibody for 2 h on ice. Following addition of protein A- or G-Sepharose the suspension was incubated rotating for 1 h. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were eluted by incubation with SDS sample buffer for 5 min at 95 °C. Samples were resolved with SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon-P, and immunoblotted according to the antibody manufacturer's instructions. Total cell lysates were prepared by using radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris base, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, 10 mm tetrasodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 7.4) and one tablet Complete inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml of lysis buffer. GST Fusion Protein Production—Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli DH5α transformed with constructs of GST fusion proteins of the various regions of the intracellular domain of c-Kit were grown in LB with ampicillin (18Linnekin D. DeBerry C.S. Mou S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27450-27455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The next day the subcultures were diluted 10 times in fresh LB. GST fusion protein production was induced by 1.5-h incubation with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C. The bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 5 min and then resuspended in 1 ml of 8 m urea, 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with one tablet of Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) per 50 ml of buffer. After 30-s sonication, the suspension was incubated for 1 h at room temperature and then diluted 10-fold in phosphate-buffered saline complemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysate was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against a 100-fold volume of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The dialyzed material was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. Next pre-swollen glutathione-agarose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated under rotation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor mixture. The yield and integrity of the GST fusion proteins was analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. GST Binding Assay—Cell lysates (1 mg of total protein) were incubated with 5 μg of GST fusion protein adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h rotating at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and bound proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon P membrane, and immunoblotted as described above. Equal loading of GST fusion protein was verified by Ponceau S staining of the Immobilon P membrane. Affinity Precipitation of Cellular Ras-GTP—Ras-GTP loading was analyzed using GST-Raf-RBD pull down assays, performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnologies, Lake Placid, NY). In brief, equal amounts of lysates (1.5 mg) were incubated with 10 μg of GST-Raf-RBD conjugated to agarose beads rotating for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times, and associated proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Ras antibodies. Equal loading were verified by running a parallel gel with total cell lysate. PI 3-Kinase Assay—c-Kit was immunoprecipitated from 0.3 mg of cleared lysate as described above. Next, beads were washed twice with lysis buffer, once with 1 m LiCl, and once with PI 3-kinase assay buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EGTA). The buffer was removed completely, and 50 μl of PI 3-kinase assay buffer containing 0.3 μl of phosphoinositide (20 mg/ml stock; Sigma catalog number P-6023) was added to each tube. Next, 5 μl of MgCl2 mix (10x; x = sample number): 5 mm ATP-0.2x/2 m MgCl2-0.5x/[γ-32P]ATP-0.5x/PI 3-kinase assay buffer-3.8x) was added followed by a 20-min incubation at room temperature. The kinase reaction was terminated by adding 150 μl of CHCl3:MeOH:HCl (100:200:2) and 120 μl of CHCl3. The tubes were mixed, and the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 1 min. 150 μl of lower phase was transfer into a fresh tube. 100 μl of wash buffer was added, contents were mixed, the mixture was centrifuged, and 110 μl of lower phase was transferred to a new tube. One more extraction with wash buffer was performed. 80 μl of lower phase was transferred to a new tube and allowed to dry. The dried lipid was reconstituted with 20 μl of CHCl3 and spotted onto a TLC plate (Z29297, Sigma). The TLC plate was transferred to a chamber saturated with CHCl3:MeOH:NH4OH:H20 (215:190:25:35). The samples were separated by TLC, and PI 3-kinase activity was visualized with autoradiography and quantitated using a PhosphorImager Storm 860 (Amersham Biosciences). SCF Combined with GM-CSF Induces Synergistic Proliferation in MO7e Cells—We were interested in understanding the mechanism(s) mediating synergistic growth by SCF and GM-CSF. Previous work has shown that the megakaryoblastic cell line MO7e is a suitable model for studying synergy (19Avanzi G.C. Lista P. Giovinazzo B. Miniero R. Saglio G. Benetton G. Coda R. Cattoretti G. Pegoraro L. Br. J. Haematol. 1988; 69: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 20Hendrie P.C. Miyazawa K. Yang Y.C. Langefeld C.D. Broxmeyer H.E. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1031-1037PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1A illustrates the greater than additive tritiated thymidine incorporation of these cells in response to GM-CSF and SCF combined compared with responses to each as a single factor. Next we investigated synergistic growth of MO7e cells in the presence of reagents that interfere with c-Kit function through two distinct mechanisms. One involved inhibition of c-Kit kinase activity, and the other targeted a structural domain in the c-Kit extracellular region with an antibody. Addition of a low molecular weight inhibitor targeting c-Kit kinase activity (AG1296) resulted in a complete inhibition of SCF-induced proliferation but had no significant effect on proliferation induced by GM-CSF (Fig. 1B). This contrasted the minimal effects of the Me2SO vehicle control on growth. Fig. 5 (see below) illustrates that AG1296 completely blocked SCF-induced phosphorylation of c-Kit and has no effect of GM-CSF-induced phosphorylation of the β-chain subunit of the receptor. Interestingly, SCF and GM-CSF still induced synergistic proliferation, albeit reduced, in the presence of this c-Kit inhibitor (Fig. 1B). This suggests a structural role for c-Kit in synergistic growth with GM-SCF, in addition to a kinase-dependent signaling function. To further investigate the possibility of a structural role for c-Kit in synergistic growth, we included an inhibitory antibody (K-27), specific for the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain in the extracellular region of c-Kit (21Blechman J.M. Lev S. Barg J. Eisenstein M. Vaks B. Vogel Z. Givol D. Yarden Y. Cell. 1995; 80: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), in the proliferation assay. This resulted in complete inhibition of the SCF-induced DNA synthesis (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, this antibody also inhibited GM-CSF-induced proliferation (50–60% reduction), as well as blocked synergistic growth of SCF and GM-CSF in combination. An isotype-matched control antibody had minimal effect on growth. One model compatible with these data is that the K-27 antibody interferes with a physical complex between c-Kit and the β-chain of the GM-CSF receptor. c-Kit Forms a Complex with the β-Chain of the GM-CSF Receptor—To determine if the β-chain of the GM-CSF receptor associates with c-Kit, we immunoprecipitated the β-chain from cells stimulated with SCF, GM-CSF, or the combination. The immunocomplex was resolved using SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane. Fig. 2 (top panel) shows a phosphotyrosine immunoblot displaying bands with sizes corresponding to c-Kit (∼160 kDa) and the β-chain (∼130 kDa) in the β-chain immunoprecipitate. To confirm the identity of the phosphotyrosine bands, the membrane was reprobed with antibodies specific for c-Kit and β-chain (Fig. 2, middle panel and lower panel). This experiment shows that a fraction of the c-Kit population is constitutively associated with the β-chain, and within this complex c-Kit can be activated by SCF. Notably, the integrity of this complex was highly dependent on lysis conditions (data not shown). In MO7e cells we were unable to co-immunoprecipitate the β-chain with c-Kit. However, in the murine cell line MTHC transfected with human c-Kit we could observe the reciprocal interaction with endogenous murine β-chain (data not shown). Thus a likely explanation for the failure to detect the β-chain in c-Kit immunoprecipitates using MO7e cells is that the antibodies we utilized against β-chain do not detect the human protein well enough in immunoblotting to visualize the co-immunoprecipitation. Further experiments confirmed that the β-chain antibodies were superior in detecting the murine protein compared with human (data not shown). To map the region of c-Kit involved in binding to the β-chain, we utilized GST fusion proteins of the different regions of the c-Kit intracellular domain. These include the juxtamembrane region (JXM, amino acids 544–577), the first part of the catalytic domain (K1, amino acids 578–685), the kinase insert (INS, amino acids 686–762), the second part of the catalytic domain (K2, amino acids 763–925), and the C-terminal tail (CT, amino acids 926–976). Because the association detected in the co-immunoprecipitation experiment was constitutive and, thus, independent of the phosphorylation status, we utilized unphosphorylated GST fusion proteins. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the β-chain co-precipitated most readily with the first part of the kinase domain. Equal loading of GST fusion proteins was verified by Ponceau S staining (Fig. 3B). This experiment indicates an intracellular mechanism for the interaction between c-Kit and the β-chain but does not exclude contributions from the c-Kit extracellular domain. Stimulation with SCF or GM-CSF Does Not Result in Transphosphorylation of the Reciprocal Receptor—To investigate the possibility of trans-phosphorylation between of c-Kit by kinases associated with the GM-CSF receptor, we stimulated MO7e cells for various periods of time with SCF, GM-CSF, or the combination. Cells were lysed, and c-Kit was immunoprecipitated and resolved using SDS-PAGE. After transfer to Immobilon-P membranes, immunoblotting with phosphotyrosine and c-Kit antibodies was performed. As can be seen in Fig. 4, no significant phosphorylation of c-Kit could be detected after GM-CSF treatment. Furthermore, stimulation with SCF together with GM-CSF did not enhance phosphorylation of c-Kit beyond that seen by SCF alone. These results do not exclude the possibility that trans-phosphorylation of c-Kit occurs at one or more specific tyrosine residues with such low stoichiometry that it is not detected by global phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. However, phosphospecific antibodies directed to tyrosine residues 703, 719, 823, and 936 in c-Kit did not reveal any significant differences in phosphorylation levels after stimulation with SCF alone or in combination with GM-CSF (see Fig. 8A and data not shown). This result is of importance because it contrasts the results for c-Kit and the Epo receptor where trans-phosphorylation has been observed and suggested to contribute to synergy (9Wu H. Klingmuller U. Besmer P. Lodish H.F. Nature. 1995; 377: 242-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar).Fig. 8PI 3-kinase coupling to c-Kit after stimulation with SCF and GM-CSF as single factors or in combination. MO7e cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml SCF, 5 ng/ml GM-CSF, or the combination as indicated. The cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-c-Kit antibody (A) or an anti-p85 antibody (B). Immunocomplexes were separated 8% SDS-PAGE and transfer to an Immobilon-P membrane. After blocking, the membrane was immunoblotted as indicated. C shows the enzymatic activity of PI 3-kinase after stimulation with SCF, GM-CSF, or the combination. For each panel the results of a representative experiment of three are shown. Ip, immunoprecipitation; Ib, immunoblot; C, indicates immunoprecipitation with species-matched control antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To assess whether c-Kit contributed to GM-CSF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-chain, cells were pre-treated with a low molecular weight inhibitor against c-Kit (AG1296) before stimulation. c-Kit or the β-chain were immunoprecipitated, and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membranes and subsequent immunoblotting. Fig. 5A illustrates that preincubation with AG1296 completely blocks SCF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Kit. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-chain is not significantly affected by AG1296 (Fig. 5B). Thus, GM-CSF receptor β-chain tyrosine phosphorylation is not dependent on c-Kit kinase activity. In summary, our findings demonstrate that c-Kit and the β-chain component of the GM-CSF receptor interact in vitro and in situ. This interaction is constitutive and does not lead to trans-phosphorylation of either receptor. Further, inhibition of c-Kit activity does not completely eliminate synergistic growth in response to SCF and GM-CSF. These data in combination with the striking effect of an antibody specific for the fourth immunoglobulin-like domain of c-Kit on synergy in response to SCF with GM-CSF support the possibility of kinase-independent mechanisms contributing to synergistic growth in response to SCF and GM-CSF. The MAP Kinase Pathway Is Synergistically Activated by SCF in Combination with GM-CSF—Although the above data demonstrate that c-Kit makes kinase-independent contributions to synergy, treatment with an inhibitor of c-Kit (Fig. 1B) suggested kinase-dependent components as well. Accordingly, we next sought to define kinase-dependent components of synergistic growth. Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that neither c-Kit nor the β-chain component of the GM-CSF receptor was phosphorylated synergistically in response to both factors in combination. This finding is supported in the literature (22Miyazawa K. Hendrie P.C. Mantel C. Wood K. Ashman L.K. Broxmeyer H.E. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1110-1123PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kamijo T. Koike K.

SCF activates a variety of different signaling pathways downstream of activated c-Kit (24Linnekin D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1053-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Consequently we next were interested in addressing whether one or more pathways downstream of c-Kit contributed to synergy. One pathway of particular interest is the Ras-MAP kinase cascade. There is conflicting data in the literature relating to whether the Ras-MAP kinase pathway is synergistically activated in response to SCF in combination with GM-CSF or IL-3. Work by O'Farrell et al. (12O'Farrell A.M. Ichihara M. Mui A.L. Miyajima A. Blood. 1996; 87: 3655-3668Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Pearson et al. (13Pearson M.A. O'Farrell A.M. Dexter T.M. Whetton A.D. Owen-Lynch P.J. Heyworth C.M. Growth Factors. 1998; 15: 293-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), and Lee et al. (15Lee Y. Mantel C. Anzai N. Braun S.E. Broxmeyer H.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 675-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) suggested synergistic activation of this pathway in response to both factors. In contrast, in the studies of Hallek et al. (22Miyazawa K. Hendrie P.C. Mantel C. Wood K. Ashman L.K. Broxmeyer H.E. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 1110-1123PubMed Google Scholar) and Miyazawa et al. (25Hallek M. Druker B. Lepisto E.M. Wood K.W. Ernst T.J. Griffin J.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 153: 176-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) this was not observed. In an attempt to resolve this controversy we examined the effect of SCF and GM-CSF on activation of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. We first examined the role of c-Kit kinase activity in SCF-induced activation of Erk1/2. Indeed, studies with the c-Kit inhibitor demonstrate that activation of this pathway is dependent on c-Kit activity (data not shown). Phosphorylation of both Erk1/2 and Mek1/2 on residues Thr202/Tyr204 and Ser217/Thr221, respectively, closely correlates with activation of these kinases. Consequently we used phospho-specific antibodies directed against both these proteins. Both Mek1/2 and Erk1/2 were phosphorylated synergistically after concurrent stimulation with SCF and GM-CSF (Fig. 6, B and"

We have used a rapid transient kinetic approach combined with site-directed mutagenesis to characterize the role of the metal ion as well as to explore the catalytic mechanisms of the two classes of enzymes. In the metal-dependent Aquifex pyrophilus KDO8P synthase, Cys11 was replaced by Asn (ApC11N), and in the metal-independent Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase a reciprocal mutation, Asn26 to Cys, was prepared (EcN26C). The ApC11N mutant retained about 10% of the wild-type maximal activity in the absence of metal ions.

J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This enzymatic reaction plays an essential role in the assembly process of lipopolysaccharides of most Gram-negative bacteria, and therefore represents an attractive target for the design of novel antibacterial drugs (2Clements J.M.

While earlier studies on Escherichia coli KDO8P synthase have established that this enzyme does not require metals (1Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has recently been demonstrated that enzymes from the hyperthermophilic bacteria Aquifex aeolicus (4Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22824-22831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), Aquifex pyrophilus (5Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and from the pathogenic bacterium Helicobacter pylori (6Krosky D.J. Alm R. Berg M. Carmel G. Tummino P.J. Xu B. Yang W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1594: 297-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), require a divalent metal cofactor for catalysis. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis (7Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 8Jensen R.A. Xie G. Calhoun D.H. Bonner C.A. J. Mol. Evol. 2002; 54: 416-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggests that KDO8P synthases from other pathogenic bacteria, i.e. Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Campylobacter jejuni, may also be metal-dependent enzymes. This is reminiscent of another class of enzymes, aldolases, which catalyze a similar aldol-type C-C bond formation (9Wong C.-H. Whitesides G.H. Enzymes in Synthetic Organic Chemistry. 12. Elsevier Science, Ltd., Oxford1994: 195-242Google Scholar). Class I aldolases, which are primarily found in animals and higher plants, do not require a metal cofactor for catalysis. In contrast, Class II aldolases, found predominantly in prokaryotes, use a divalent metal cofactor that functions as a Lewis acid. Thus, in addition to aldolases, KDO8P synthase represents another example of an enzyme that is metal-independent in one class of organisms (Class I) but metal-dependent in another (Class II). Therefore, KDO8P synthase represents a distinctive target for the development of selective, narrow-spectrum antibiotics. The catalytic mechanism of E. coli KDO8P synthase has been studied extensively and earlier studies have established that the reaction occurs through the unusual cleavage of the C-O bond of PEP (10Hedstrom L. Abeles R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 816-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 11Dotson G.D. Dua R.K. Clemens J.C. Wooten E.W. Woodard R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13698-13705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). KDO8P synthesis was shown to be a sequential process in which the kinetically preferred order of binding involves the PEP preceding the binding of acyclic A5P, and the release of inorganic phosphate preceding the dissociation of the product KDO8P (12Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The condensation step was shown to be stereospecific, with the si face of PEP attaching to the re face of the carbonyl group of A5P (see Scheme 1) (13Dotson G.D. Nanjappan P. Reily M.D. Woodard R.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12392-12397Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Kohen A. Berkovich R. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Biooorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1993; 13: 1577-1582Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). More recent studies using rapid chemical quench techniques (15Liang P.H. Lewis J. Anderson K.S. Kohen A. D'Souza F.W. Benenson Y. Baasov T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16390-16399Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), together with the synthesis and evaluation of an acyclic bisubstrate inhibitor (16Du S. Faiger H. Belakhov V. Baasov T. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 2671-2682Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), supported the reaction pathway that involves the formation of an inherently unstable, acyclic bisphosphate intermediate 1 (Scheme 1). Moreover, the identification of 1 as a true reaction intermediate was provided recently (17Li Z. Sau A.K. Shen S. Whitehouse C. Baasov T. Anderson K.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 9938-9939Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) using time-resolved electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiments that directly monitor the enzymatic reaction with its natural substrates on a very short, millisecond time scale. This study has established the time-dependent formation and decay of the enzyme bound intermediate 1 on a time scale consistent with substrate decay and product formation, as expected for a true reaction intermediate. In addition to the mechanistic studies described above, several crystal structures of the E. coli enzyme have recently been reported (18Wagner T. Kretsinger R.H. Bauerle R. Tolbert W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 301: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 19Radaev S. Dastidar P. Patel M. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9476-9484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), including the structures of KDO8P synthase in its binary complexes with a mechanism-based inhibitor and with the substrate PEP (20Asojo O. Friedman J. Adir N. Belakhov V. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6326-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Based on the position of PEP at the active site, it was suggested (20Asojo O. Friedman J. Adir N. Belakhov V. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 6326-6334Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that the condensation step between PEP and A5P should proceed in a stepwise fashion in which the initial formation of a transient oxocarbenium intermediate 1a, or an early transition state having oxocarbenium character, must be followed by the capture of water at the cationic C2 position to complete the formation of acyclic intermediate 1 (Scheme 2, path a). This mechanism is consistent with earlier observations that examined intramolecular models of KDO8P synthase-catalyzed reaction (21Du S. Plat D. Belakhov V. Baasov T. J. Org. Chem. 1997; 62: 794-804Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Unlike the reaction of E. coli KDO8P synthase, the catalytic mechanism of the metal-dependent KDO8P synthases has been studied to a lesser extent (22Wang J. Duewel H.S. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15676-15683Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Duewel H.S. Radaev S. Wang J. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8393-8402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Based on the three-dimensional structures of the A. aeolicus enzyme in complex with exogenous Cd2+ and various combinations of substrates and/or inhibitors, it was proposed that a water molecule activated by a metal ion initiates the condensation reaction by attacking the C2 of PEP followed by subsequent coupling of the carbanionic C3 with the carbonyl of A5P which leads to the formation of the same acyclic intermediate 1 (Scheme 2, path b). Since this mechanism includes the opposite sequence of condensation steps to that suggested for metal-independent enzymes (Scheme 2, path a), it seems that the major difference between the mechanisms of Class I and Class II enzymes is in the sequence of the elementary steps that leads to the formation of the same intermediate 1. The three-dimensional structure of the A. aeolicus enzyme in complex with exogenous Cd2+ also identified the amino acid residues involved in metal binding: Cys11, His185, Glu222, and Asp233, along with the metal-coordinated water molecule (23Duewel H.S. Radaev S. Wang J. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8393-8402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To further delineate the role of these residues in metal binding and/or catalysis, the H185G mutant of A. aeolicus enzyme was recently prepared and structures of Cd2+-H185G enzyme in its substrate-free form and in complex with PEP, and PEP plus A5P were determined (24Wang J. Duewel H.S. Stuckey J.A. Woodard R.W. Gatti D.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 324: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike the wild-type enzyme, no metal coordinated catalytic water was found in either, the structure of the substrate-free Cd2+-H185G enzyme or the structures of Cd2+-H185G bound with PEP or with PEP plus A5P. Instead, in the later structures the carboxylate moiety of PEP binds directly to the metal ion and replaces the water and the His185 as the ligands. Despite the lack of catalytic water, the Cd2+-H185G enzyme retains 8% of the wild-type activity, raising the question about the exact role of the metal ion in the metal-dependent enzymes. We have recently cloned the kdsA gene from the hyperthermophilic bacterium A. pyrophilus, expressed the gene in E. coli and conducted an initial biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme (5Shulami S.

Sequence alignment revealed that the four amino acid residues that were identified in A. aeolicus KDO8P synthase as ligands of the metal ion are located at identical positions in the A. pyrophilus enzyme. Therefore, it is likely that these residues are also involved in metal binding in the A. pyrophilus KDO8P synthase. It is noteworthy that three out of the four metal binding residues, His, Glu, and Asp in metal-dependent KDO8P synthases, are completely conserved in all KDO8P synthases currently sequenced (7Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), implying that they play an essential role in both metal-dependent and metal-independent KDO8P synthase enzymes. Furthermore, the Cys residue is conserved only in metal-dependent enzymes (7Birck M.R. Woodard R.W. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 52: 205-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), whereas in metal-independent enzymes, a conserved Asn replaces Cys. Based on these observations, we hypothesized (5Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), that a single amino acid replacement, Cys to Asn, could eliminate the requirement for metals in metal-dependent enzymes, and similarly, the reciprocal replacement in the metal-independent E. coli KDO8P synthase (Asn26 to Cys) could result in metal-dependent activity. In the present work, we describe the characterization of a C11N mutant of A. pyrophilus KDO8P synthase (ApC11N) and an N26C mutant of E. coli KDO8P synthase (EcN26C) with respect to metal binding and catalysis. The specific questions these studies were designed to address are as follows: (i) What is the role of the divalent metal ion in metal-dependent enzyme? Does the metal ion play a direct catalytic or structural role in catalysis? (ii) Can a single amino acid mutation be sufficient to convert the enzyme from a metal-dependent to a metal-independent and conversely? (iii) How do these changes affect the overall reaction pathway? The present study provides the first demonstration that a reciprocal single mutation has the potential to convert any of metal-dependent class KDO8P synthase to a metal-independent variant and vice versa. Some important mechanistic implications of these observations are discussed. Chemicals and Reagents—A5P was prepared enzymatically according to the procedure of Whitesides and co-workers (25Bednarski M.D. Crans D.C. DiCosimo R. Simon E.S. Stein P.D. Whitesides G.M. Schneider M.J. Tetrahedron Lett. 1988; 29: 427-430Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The potassium salt of PEP was prepared in large quantities as previously described (26Hirschbein B.L. Mazenod F.P. Whitesides G.M. J. Org. Chem. 1982; 47: 3765-3766Crossref Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Metal salts used in this study were obtained from Aldrich and all other chemicals were purchased from Aldrich or from Sigma and were used without further purification. Solutions and buffers were passed through a column of Chelex 100 (Na+ from 100-200 mesh; Bio-Rad), to remove all traces of metal ion contamination. [1-14C]pyruvate was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, and the HPLC Mono Q 5/5 anion exchange column was from Amersham Biosciences. [1-14C]PEP Synthesis—Radiolabeled PEP was enzymatically synthesized from [1-14C]pyruvate (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) by coupling pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK) obtained as a generous gift from Dr. Dunaway-Mariano, to inorganic pyrophosphatase reaction. After purification by Q-Sepharose anion-exchange chromatography using a linear gradient (20 mm to 1 m) of triethylammonium bicarbonate (TEAB) buffer, the fractions containing PEP were pooled and lyophilized. Final stock solutions (5.6 mm) contained 29,300 dpm/nmol. Bacterial Strains and Plasmids—E. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene La Jolla, CA) was used for general cloning. E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Promega, Madison, WI) was used for protein production with the pET9d expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). DNA Manipulations—Plasmid DNA was purified with the WizardR DNA Clean-Up system (Promega). DNA was transformed by electroporation using GeneZapper (IBI, New Haven, CT) for strains XL-1 Blue and BL21(DE3). DNA sequencing was performed at the DNA sequencing unit of the Weizmann Institute (Rehovot, Israel). DNA sequences were analyzed using MacVector™ 7.0 (Oxford Molecular Ltd.) and by the software package of the Genetics Computer Group (GCG, version 9, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Cloning and Mutagenesis—The kdsA gene (GenBank™ accession number AY135660) from A. pyrophilus was cloned in the pET9d expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) as previously described (5Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The kdsA gene from E. coli was amplified from the pJU1 vector (12Kohen A. Jakob A. Baasov T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 443-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), using two PCR primers that allowed the in-frame cloning in the pET vector. The N-terminal primer (5′-GGAATATCATGAAACAAAAAGTCGTTAGC-3′) was made to contain an ATG transnational start codon inside a BspHI restriction site (TCATGA). The C-terminal primer (5′-GCGATAGATCTTACTTGCTGGTATCCAGTTC-3′) contained a stop codon (TAG) and a BglII restriction site (AGATCT) at the end of the gene. Following PCR amplification the gene was cloned into the T7 expression vector pET9d (linearized with NcoI and BamHI), resulting in plasmid pET9d-kdsA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The mutagenic primers for C11N of KDO8P synthase from A. pyrophilus were as follows (the mutated nucleotides are shown in bold): 5′-GACTCGCTCTCGATCGCATTGGGTCCCGC-3′ and 5′-GCGGGACCCAATGCGATCGAGAGCGAGTC-3′. The primers for N26C of KDO8P synthase from E. coli were as follows (the mutated nucleotides are shown in bold): 5′-GATTCCAACACGCACATGCCGCCAAACAGTAC-3′ and 5′-GTACTGTTTGGCGGCAT GTGCGTGTTGGAATC-3′. The mutated genes were sequenced to confirm that only the desired mutation was inserted. The mutated genes were overexpressed and purified as described below. Purification of the kdsA Gene Products—The recombinant kdsA genes from both E. coli (1Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and A. pyrophilus bacteria (5Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) were expressed using similar procedures. Briefly, the expression was carried out by growing overnight cultures of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying pET9d-kdsA in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with kanamycin (25 μg ml-1), without induction. Purification procedure of the kdsA gene from E. coli was similar to that of the thermostable enzyme but with the following modifications: all manipulations were carried out at 4 °C and without the heat treatment step. The overnight cultures (2 liters) were harvested, resuspended in 15 ml of 50 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5, and disrupted by two passages through a FrenchR Press (Spectronic Instruments, Inc., Rochester, NY) at room temperature. Cell extracts were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was applied to an anion-exchange column (HiPrep 16/10Q FF, Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The column was first washed with five column volumes of equilibration buffer and then eluted with 20 column volumes of a linear gradient of 0.05-1.0 m NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The enzymes eluted as distinct peaks, collected, and found to be homogeneous as determined by SDS-PAGE. Aliquots (1 ml) of the purified enzymes were stored at -80 °C. In the purification of the wild-type and mutant A. pyrophilus KDO8P synthases a heat-treatment step was included (65 °C, 30 min) as previously described (5Shulami S. Yaniv O. Rabkin E. Shoham Y. Baasov T. Extremophiles. 2003; 7: 471-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Metal Content Analysis for the As-isolated and EDTA-treated KDO8P Synthase—The procedure described below applies to both the E. coli and A. pyrophilus KDO8P synthase and to their respective mutants N26C and C11N. Native KDO8P synthase enzymes as isolated were concentrated by ultrafiltration using FUGISEP (Wokingham Berkshire, England) to 6-7 mg/ml. Enzymes were treated with 10 mm EDTA for 3 h at room temperature, and then dialyzed against 500 ml of buffer 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 at 4 °C with two buffer changes, one with 2 mm EDTA and the second with 1 mm EDTA for about 4 h. Overnight dialysis was carried out against 1.5 liters of buffer with 1 μm EDTA. Residual EDTA was removed by three sequential 3-h periods of dialysis at 4 °C against 50 mm buffer Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 (without EDTA) containing Chelex 100 (25 g/liter, Na+ form, 100-200 mesh, Bio-Rad). Additional samples of the native enzymes were prepared without EDTA treatment. The concentration of metals: Mn2+, Cd2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+, in both EDTA-treated and EDTA-untreated enzymes (40 μm), was determined by high resolution Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) on a PerkinElmer Optima 3000DV. Samples of the dialysate buffer (from the last change) were also analyzed for metal content, and the observed concentrations were subtracted from those obtained in the enzymes samples. Cu2+ Reconstitution of the EcN26C—An aliquot of the EDTA-treated enzyme (20 μm) was diluted in 500 μl of metal-free buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl), pH 7.5, and various concentrations of CuSO4 were added. After 2 min of incubation at 35 °C, the absorbance spectra were recorded on a Biochrom 4060 spectrophotometer. Steady-state Kinetic Analysis—The KDO8P synthase activity was determined either by a discontinuous colorimetric assay or a continuous spectrophotometric assay. All experiments were carried out in 100 mm HEPES pH 7.5 at 60 °C for A. pyrophilus wild-type and C11N KDO8P synthase and at 25 or 37 °C for E. coli wild-type and N26C KDO8P synthase in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The dependence of A. pyrophilus wild-type and C11N-KDO8P synthase on metal chelator concentration and the dependence of E. coli KDO8P synthase wild-type and N26C mutant on metal ion concentration were followed using a discontinuous assay as described in the next paragraph. All of the other steady-state kinetic experiments were followed spectrophotometrically at 232 nm by monitoring the consumption of PEP (ϵ232 = 2.84 mm-1 cm-1). Effect of Metal Chelators and Divalent Metal Ions on KDO8P Synthase Activity—A discontinuous assay was used to study the effects of metal chelators and divalent metal ions on enzymatic activities. In the discontinuous assay, the amount of the KDO8P product was determined by the thiobarbituric acid assay as specified by Ray (1Ray P.H. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 141: 635-644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 μmol of KDO8P per minute. The standard discontinuous assay was conducted in a final volume of 200 μl of 100 mm HEPES or 50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 2 mm PEP, 2 mm A5P, and appropriately diluted enzyme. After incubation, the reaction was quenched by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. To ensure initial velocity conditions, the enzyme concentration and the incubation time were chosen so that the substrate conversion was less than 5%, and the product formation was linear over the time course the measurements were made. (i) Catalytic Activity of A. pyrophilus Wild-type and C11N KDO8P Synthase—The specific activities of wild-type and mutant KDO8P synthase from A. pyrophilus were determined at 60 °C in 100 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5. Aliquots (10 μl) of the wild-type enzyme (0.3 μm) or its C11N mutant (50 μm) were first preincubated with EDTA (10 μl, 4 mm) for 15 min at room temperature. In the case of wild-type enzyme, a buffer solution (160 μl) containing 0.48 mm Cd2+ was added to the enzyme followed by 20 μl of 20 mm PEP. In the case of C11N mutant, Cd2+ was omitted from the reaction buffer. The resulting mixture was incubated for 10 min at 60 °C, and the reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of A5P (20 mm). After incubation at 60 °C, the reaction was quenched by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 5%. The effect of chelators on the activity of A. pyrophilus wild-type KDO8P synthase and the C11N mutant, was determined as follows: 10 μl of enzyme (2 μm) was incubated with 10 μl of EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline at a final concentration of 10-500 μm for 15 min at room temperature. The assays were performed at 60 °C with the same final concentration of the chelator. The effect of various divalent metals was measured by preincubating the enzyme with 4 mm EDTA for 15 min at room temperature, followed by addition of reaction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 160 μl) containing various metal concentrations, and the resulted mixture was again incubated for an additional 10 min at 60 °C. The reactions were initiated by adding 20 μl of buffer containing A5P (20 mm) and PEP (20 mm). (ii) Catalytic Activity of E. coli Wild-type and N26C KDO8P Synthase—The effect of metals on E. coli KDO8P synthase activity was assayed as follows: 160 μl reaction buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 20 μl of various metals and 20 μl of the mixture of substrates, A5P (20 mm) and PEP (20 mm) were prewarmed for 10 min at 37 °C. The reaction was initiated by adding 20 μl of wild type (0.3 μm) or EDTA-treated N26C mutant (6 μm), and the reaction was allowed to proceed under the initial velocity conditions. More detailed kinetic studies were carried out using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. The reactions were performed in 100 mm Tris, pH 7.5 at 37 and 60 °C for E. coli KDO8P synthase and A. pyrophilus enzymes, respectively. Assay solutions contained appropriately diluted enzymes with varying concentrations (0.1 to 5 Km) of one substrate while the other substrate was held constant (10× Km). Data were fit to Michaelis-Menten equation for metal dependence experiments or to the Hill equation when cooperative behavior was observed for substrate dependence experiments. The kcat, Km, and Hill coefficient (nH) parameters for metal, PEP, and A5P were determined. The values of Km and kcat were determined by non-linear regression analysis using the program GRAFIT 5.0 or Kaleidagraph 3.52. Pre-steady-state Experiments—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a Kintek RFQ-3 Rapid Chemical Quench (Kintek Instruments, Austin, TX) as previously described (28Johnson K.A. Enzymes. 1992; 20: 1-61Crossref Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by mixing the enzyme solution (15 μl) with the radiolabeled substrate (15 μl). In all cases, the concentrations of the enzyme and substrates cited in the text are those after mixing and during the reaction. The reaction was then quenched with 67 μl of 0.6 n KOH. 60 μl of each sample was removed and analyzed by HPLC with on-line UV-vis detector (Waters 486 Tunable Absorbance Detector) followed by Flo-One radioactivity detection (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). The analysis system was automated using a Waters 717plus (Milford, MA) autosampler. The substrates and products were separated on an anion exchange Mono-Q HR 5/5 column (Amersham Biosciences) using a 25 min of linear gradient from 20 mm to 1 m TEAB followed by 10 min column equilibration with 20 mm TEAB. The elution was performed with a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Before entering the radioactivity detector the eluent was mixed with liquid scintillation mixture (Monoflow V, National Diagnostics) at a flow rate of 5 ml/min. During the HPLC analysis a small amount of"

Like other bosons, such as those studied in ultracold atomic vapors, excitons should form under Bose condensation and fall into a single quantum state. In his Perspective, Eisenstein discusses recent efforts to observe excitonic Bose condensation in layered materials. The major obstacle has been the tendency of the electron and the hole to simply recombine and disappear. By applying a magnetic field, however, the excitons can be stabilized, leading to increased hopes that a clear case of condensation will eventually be observed."

We used the radio Doppler data generated with the Galileo spacecraft during its second encounter with Ganymede on 6 September 1996 to model the mass anomalies. Two surface mass anomalies, one a positive mass at high latitude and the other a negative mass at low latitude, can explain the data. There are no obvious geological features that can be identified with the anomalies."

IL-6-induced expression of acute-phase protein genes in the liver is tightly regulated through both IL-6-induced feedback inhibitors and the activity of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin-1β. In previous studies mechanisms for how IL-1β counteracts IL-6-dependent acute-phase protein gene induction have been proposed. Herein we analyzed IL-1β-mediated regulation of IL-6-induced expression of the feedback inhibitor SOCS3. In hepatocytes IL-1β alone does not induce SOCS3 expression, but it counteracts SOCS3-promoter activation in long term studies. Surprisingly, short term stimulation revealed IL-1β to be a potent enhancer of SOCS3 expression in concert with IL-6. This activity of IL-1β does not depend on IL-1β-dependent STAT1-serine phosphorylation but on NF-κB-dependent gene induction. Such a regulatory network allows IL-1β to counteract IL-6-dependent expression of acute-phase protein genes without inhibiting IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression and provides a reasonable mechanism for the IL-1β-dependent inhibition of acute-phase gene induction, because reduced SOCS3 expression would lead to enhanced IL-6 activity.

IL-1β has a co-regulatory function on IL-6-induced gene expression: Several IL-6-induced acute-phase proteins such as serum amyloid A, C-reactive protein, and α1-acid glycoprotein are positively regulated by IL-1β. On the other hand, fibrinogen, α1-antichymotrypsin, α2-macroglobulin, and thiostatin expression are suppressed by IL-1β (for review see Refs. 1Suffredini A.F. Fantuzzi G. Badolato R. Oppenheim J.J.

Hanada T. Yoshimura A. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2003; 3: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SOCS3 is supposed to act as a negative regulator of JAK/STAT-dependent IL-6-signaling by binding to tyrosine 759 of gp130, resulting in reduced activation/phosphorylation of JAKs, gp130, and STATs (6Schmitz J.

Recent findings demonstrate that in SOCS3-deficient macrophages IL-6 induces an anti-inflammatory response. Thus, the rather restricted view of SOCS3 as an inhibitor of IL-6-induced JAK/STAT signaling should be extended to the role as a modulator of biological functions of IL-6 (12Yasukawa H. Ohishi M.

J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). With respect to the importance of SOCS3 for the regulation of IL-6 signaling (12Yasukawa H. Ohishi M. Mori H. Murakami M.

Here we show that IL-1β does not induce SOCS3 in hepatocytes. However, a time-dependent dual regulatory function of IL-1β on IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression was found: we discovered an enhanced SOCS3 expression by IL-1β immediately after stimulation. In contrast, SOCS3-promoter activation was suppressed by IL-1β at later time points. Both functions of IL-1β were dependent on the activation of NF-κB. Surprisingly, in the absence of NF-κB activation early SOCS3 expression even decreased in response to IL-1β. This inhibitory function seems to be compensated by the strong NF-κB-mediated positive regulatory activity in the initial phase of IL-1β/IL-6 co-stimulation and IL-1β-dependent stabilization of SOCS3 mRNA.

(Lake Placid, NY). HRP-coupled secondary antibodies were form DAKO (Hamburg, Germany). Construction of Expression Vectors—The SOCS3-reporter construct contains the region -511 to +929 of the murine SOCS3 promoter (kindly provided by Shlomo Melmed, Los Angeles, CA). The IκBα(S/A) expression vector encodes for an IκBα mutant, where serines 32 and 36 have been mutated to alanine to avoid phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of IκBα (Upstate Laboratories Inc.). The SIE-tk-Luc construct, containing two copies of the STAT consensus binding sequence from the c-fos promoter upstream of a thymidine kinase minimal promoter, was kindly provided by Hugues Gascan (Angers, France) (24Coqueret O. Gascan H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18794-18800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). pSuper-SOCS3 was cloned according to SOCS3-specific siRNA sequence described by Leung et al. (25Leung K.C. Doyle N. Ballesteros M. Sjogren K. Watts C.K. Low T.H. Leong G.M. Ross R.J. Ho K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).

Cell Culture, Transfection, and Reporter Gene Analyses—Human hepatoma HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM/nutrient mix F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, streptomycin (100 mg/liter), and penicillin (60 mg/liter). For transfection of HepG2 cells, cells were grown on 6-cm plates to 30% confluency and transfected in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Calcium phosphate precipitation was performed with 3 μg of reporter construct, 2 μg of β-galactosidase expression vector (pCR3lacZ; Amersham Biosciences). Transfections were adjusted with control vectors to equal amounts of DNA. Cells were incubated with the precipitate for 16 h, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and let for additional 8-10 h in fresh medium. For reporter gene assays, including SOCS3 siRNA, HepG2 cells were grown in 6-well plates and transfected with 1.2 μg of pSuper-SOCS3 or control vector, 1.4 μg of pRcCMV-(EpoR/gp130) (26Schmitz J. Dahmen H. Grimm C. Gendo C. Müller-Newen G. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J.

Cells were stimulated with cytokines for the times indicated in the figures. Cell lysis and luciferase assays were conducted using the luciferase kit (Promega, Madison, WI), as described by the manufacturer's instructions. All expression experiments were done at least in triplicate. Luciferase activity values were normalized to transfection efficiency monitored by the co-transfected β-galactosidase expression vector. Error bars represent ±S.D. Retroviral Gene Transfer/Generation of HepG2 Cells Stably Expressing IκBa(S/A)—The pCFG5-IEGZ retroviral vector allowing expression of GFP from the same mRNA as the gene of interest has been described earlier (27Kuss A.W. Knodel M. Berberich-Siebelt F. Lindemann D. Schimpl A. Berberich I. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3077-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). ϕNX producer cells plated at a density of 1 × 106 per 10-cm plate were transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method with 10 μg of vector or pCFG5-IEGZ IκBα(S/A) plasmid DNA (28Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours later transfection efficiencies were determined by monitoring GFP expression. Subsequently, 1 mg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen) was added to the cells, which were then grown in the presence of this agent for another 2 weeks until all the cells were positive for GFP. Retroviral infection of HepG2 cells was performed with supernatants from ϕNX producer cells essentially as described for other cells (28Denk A. Goebeler M. Schmid S. Berberich I. Ritz O. Lindemann D. Ludwig S. Wirth T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28451-28458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-μm filter, and 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma) was added to the filtrate. Thereafter, medium of HepG2 cells plated in 6-well plates was replaced by ϕNX cell supernatant containing the IκBα(S/A)-cDNA containing retrovirus (giving HepG2-IκBα(S/A)) or control virus (giving HepG2-mock). Culture plates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 3 h. Medium was then replaced, and HepG2 cells were subsequently cultured in the presence of the selection marker Zeocin (Invitrogen) until all cells were positive for GFP. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Preparation of nuclear extracts and EMSAs were performed as described previously (29Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lütticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was determined with a Bio-Rad reagent. 8 μg of protein was incubated with a surplus of double-stranded 32P-labeled κB site (5′-GATCCATGGGGAATTCCCCATG-3′) for binding NF-κB. The protein·DNA complexes were separated on a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 7.5% glycerol in 0.25-fold TBE (20 mm Tris base, 20 mm boric acid, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8) at 20 V/cm for 4 h. Gels were fixed in 10% methanol, 10% acetic acid, and 80% water for 1 h, dried, and autoradiographed. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses—For immunoprecipitation, cells from a 60% confluent 10-cm plate were lysed in 500 μl of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5; 150 mm NaCl; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 15% glycerol; 1 mm EDTA; 1 mm NaF; 1 mm Na3VO4). Before adding antibodies protein amounts were adjusted to be equal. Buffers were supplemented with 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, pepstatin, and leupeptin. Immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Antigens were detected by incubation with specific primary antibodies and HRP-coupled secondary antibodies (DAKO). SOCS3 detection was performed with biotinylated SOCS3-specific primary antibodies and HRP-coupled streptavidin (1:5000) (Pierce). The membranes were developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Amersham Biosciences. For immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses of SOCS3 siRNA-treated cells, HepG2 cells were cultivated on 10-cm dishes and transfected with 2.5 μg of pRcCMV-(EpoR/gp130), and 3.5 μg of pSuper-SOCS3 or control vector using FuGENE 6 reagent. Stimulation was performed with 7 units/ml Epo and/or 100 units/ml IL-1β. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA from 5 × 106 cells was isolated with the total RNA kit from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany) as described in the manufacturer's instructions. 10 μg of RNA was mixed with denaturing buffer (20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 2.2 m formaldehyde, 50% formamide, bromphenol blue, 4 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0) and denatured at 66 °C for 5 min. RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.2 m formaldehyde, 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0. The RNA was blotted by capillary blot method to NitroPlus transfer membrane (Micron Separations, Westboro, MA). RNA was immobilized at 80 °C for 2 h. The membranes were blocked in pre-hybridization buffer (1 m NaCl; 10% dextran sulfate; 1% SDS) at 66 °C for at least 2 h. Hybridization was performed at 66 °C with labeled cDNAs overnight. The XbaI/Mlu1 fragment of pEF-FLAG-I/mSOCS3 (kindly provided by D. Hilton, Melbourne, Australia) was labeled with the Random Primed DNA Labeling kit (Roche Applied Science). The membranes were washed twice in 2× NaCl/citrate buffer, 0.2% SDS at room temperature for 20 min. Then washing was performed in 0.2× NaCl/citrate buffer, 0.2% SDS at 66 °C for 20 min. The membranes were dried and subjected to autoradiography using an intensifying screen at -80 °C. For counterstaining, membranes were blocked and re-probed with an EcoR1/XhoI DNA fragment of the GAPDH-cDNA. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—HepG2 cells were grown to 80% confluence and serum-starved for 24 h. Where indicated, cells were treated with 100 units/ml IL-6 or IL-1β for 20 min. For IL-1β/IL-6 co-stimulation IL-1β was given 10 min prior to IL-6. After stimulation, cells were fixed by adding formaldehyde to a final concentration of 1% (HCHO, from a 37% HCHO-10% methanol stock, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at room temperature for 10 min. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, centrifuged, re-suspended in L1 buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 2 mm EDTA; 0.1% Nonidet P-40; and 10% glycerol) supplemented with protease inhibitors for 5 min. Nuclei were centrifuged at 3000 rpm and re-suspended in L2 buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate; and 5 mm EDTA). Chromatin was sheared by sonication (4 × 16 s at about 50% output, Branson Sonifier). Debris was eliminated by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted (1:10) in dilution buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 0.5% Nonidet P-40; 0.2 m NaCl; and 5 mm EDTA). Immunoprecipitation was performed with specific antibodies overnight. 20 μl of Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) was added at 4 °C for 45 min. Immune complexes were washed three times for 5 min with high salt buffer (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0; 0.1% SDS; 1% Nonidet P-40; 2 mm EDTA; and 0.5 m NaCl). Complexes were washed three times in 1× TE buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) and finally extracted in 1× TE buffer containing 2% SDS. Cross-linking of the protein with DNA was reverted by heating at 65 °C overnight. Supernatants were then incubated with proteinase K (100 μg at 50 °C for 2 h). DNA was extracted with phenol-chloroform, precipitated in ethanol, and resolved in 50 μl of TE buffer. 2.5 μl of DNA was used for PCR, with a specific primer for the human IκBα or SOCS3 promoter. The following promoter-specific primers were used: 5′-GACGACCCCAATTCAAATCG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGCTCGGGGAATTTCC-3′ for IκBα promoter and 5′-GCTCAGCCTTTCTCTGC-3′ and 5′-CGAAGCGGCAGCAGC-3′ for the -131 to +32 region of the human SOCS3 promoter and 5′-CAGGGTTGGCAAAGAAC-3′ and 5′-ACCTGGAGAGCCTC-3′ for the -722 to -420 region of the human SOCS3 promoter (numbering relative to the proposed transcription starting site). The PCR reaction was performed for 35 cycles in a total volume of 25 μl (1.25 unit of Taq DNA polymerase; 100 ng of each primer; 200 μm dNTP; 2.5 μl of 10× Taq buffer). PCR conditions were as follows: the first denaturation was for 94 °C for 180 s then 35 cycles consisting of denaturation (94 °C for 45 s), annealing (60 °C for 60 s), and elongation (72 °C for 60 s); the final elongation was carried out at 72 °C for 10 min. DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 2% agarose gel. DNA was visualized with ethidium bromide. IL-1β Counteracts IL-6-dependent SOCS3-promoter Activation—Our own initial experiments suggested that SOCS3 may be negatively regulated by IL-1β (22Bode J.G. Fischer R. Häussinger D. Graeve L. Heinrich P.C. Schaper F. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 1469-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To analyze the collaborative regulation of SOCS3 by IL-6 and IL-1β, we performed promoter/reporter gene assays with an SOCS3-luciferase reporter construct in human HepG2 hepatoma cells. Fig. 1A (left part) shows that the SOCS3 promoter was responsive to stimulation with IL-6 (second bar), whereas the promoter was not inducible by IL-1β (third bar). Instead, IL-1β counteracted IL-6-dependent promoter activation, because co-incubation with IL-1β significantly reduced IL-6-induced reporter activity (compare bars 2 and 4). Because NF-κB is a major mediator of IL-1β signaling, we asked whether IL-1β may act through NF-κB. Therefore, we tested whether expression of a non-degradable IκBα(S/A) inhibitor could overcome the effect of IL-1β. As shown in the right part of Fig. 1A, stable expression of IκBα(S/A) strongly affected the inhibitory action of IL-1β on SOCS3-promoter-driven reporter expression. Expression of IκB was monitored by Western blotting. Fig. 1B shows that degradation of endogenous IκBα occurred 2 min after IL-1β treatment of HepG2-mock cells. IL-1β-induced IκBα re-expression was detectable after 20 min (Fig. 1B, left panel). In contrast, expression of the endogenous IκBα as well as of the exogenous IκBα(S/A) mutant was not affected by IL-1β treatment in HepG2-IκBα(S/A) cells (right panel). IL-1β-induced NF-κB DNA-binding activity was monitored by EMSA with a κB-site-containing DNA-probe (Fig. 1C). IL-1β-induced NF-κB binding to the κB site in HepG2-mock cells was detectable already after 1 min and further increased during the following 40 min (left panel). In contrast, no NF-κB binding in response to IL-1β was detectable in HepG2-IκBα(S/A) cells (right panel) demonstrating an efficient blockade of NF-κB activation in these cells. These data suggest that IL-1β acts negatively on IL-6-mediated SOCS3 promoter activation through an NF-κB-dependent pathway. The Inhibitory Activity of IL-1β on SOCS3-promoter Activation Is Time-dependent—SOCS3 is an immediate early IL-6 response gene. Therefore, we decided to analyze the kinetics of IL-1β-induced inhibition of the SOCS3-reporter in the initial phase of expression. SOCS3-promoter-driven reporter gene expression was assessed 50, 80, 180, and 240 min after stimulation of HepG2 cells with IL-6. Reporter gene activity increased within the first 3 h but did not rise further up to 4 h of IL-6 stimulation. To our surprise, gene induction was most efficiently inhibited by IL-1β in cells stimulated for more than 3 h with IL-6 (Fig. 2, panels 3 and 4), whereas cells stimulated for 80 min were less sensitive to IL-1β (Fig. 2, panel 2). A reproducible slight increase of reporter gene induction was observed in cells stimulated with IL-6 for only 50 min (Fig. 2, panel 1). IL-1β Mediates Enhanced SOCS3 Expression in Response to IL-6 —To confirm the significance of the IL-1β-dependent increase of SOCS3-promoter activation observed in Fig. 2, we extended the duration of IL-1β pre-stimulation up to 40 min prior to addition of IL-6 (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of HepG2 cells with IL-6 for 50 min led to a 2-fold induction of reporter gene expression (left panel). As described in Fig. 2 a small but significant (p = 0.007) increase of reporter gene expression was detectable when IL-1β treatment started 10 min prior to IL-6 stimulation (bars 2 and 4). This increase was more obvious when IL-1β was given 20, 30, or 40 min before addition of IL-6 (bars 6, 8, and 10). These data suggest that IL-1β acts negatively on SOCS3 expression only in response to long term IL-6 stimulation, whereas a positive regulatory function of IL-1β is obvious early after stimulation. To inspect a putative positive effect of IL-1β on early IL-6-induced SOCS3 induction, we analyzed expression of IL-6-induced endogenous SOCS3 in response to IL-1β. Intentionally, in the following experiments only the initial phase of SOCS3 induction has been analyzed to exclude putative secondary effects mediated by SOCS3 itself. We investigated whether the supporting activity of IL-1β on IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression also affects SOCS3 mRNA levels in the initial phase of IL-6 stimulation. SOCS3 mRNA was isolated from HepG2 cells stimulated for up to 70 min with IL-6 in the presence or absence of IL-1β and analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 3B). IL-6 induced remarkable amounts of SOCS3 mRNA already after 30 min with a peak at 45 min after IL-6 stimulation (left part). In the presence of IL-1β SOCS3 mRNA levels were significantly higher and therefore detectable already 15 min post stimulation. SOCS3 protein expression was determined by immunoprecipitation and subsequent Western blotting immediately after stimulation with IL-6 (Fig. 3, C and D). SOCS3 protein was detectable after IL-6 stimulation for 40 min and further increased during the following 20 min. Indeed, IL-1β treatment led to enhanced SOCS3-protein expression (compare lanes with and without IL-1β in Fig. 3C). The activity of IL-1β on IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression was further analyzed dose dependently. Fig. 3D shows an IL-1β dose-dependent increase in SOCS3 expression in the early stage of IL-6-induced SOCS3 expression. From these data we conclude that IL-1β enhances time- and dose-dependent IL-6-induced endogenous SOCS3 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2069041568,"The binding of immune complexes to macrophage Fcγ receptor results in a subsequent inhibition of lipopolysaccharide-stimulated interleukin-12 synthesis without affecting the induction of tumor necrosis factor-α. RNA interference targeting MAST205, a 205-kDa serine/threonine kinase, and transfection of dominant negative MAST205 mutants also mimic this type II macrophage phenotype. Our previous epistasis experiments suggested that the position of MAST205 in the TLR4 signal pathway was proximal to the IκB kinase complex. We now report that MAST205 forms a complex with TRAF6, resulting in the inhibition of TRAF6 NF-κB activation. We have identified a peptide (residues 218–233) from the N terminus of MAST205 that, when coupled to a protein transduction domain, inhibits the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated activation of NF-κB, modulates the size of the MAST205·TRAF6 complex, and inhibits ubiquitination of TRAF6. A dominant negative N-terminal MAST205 deletion mutant also inhibits TRAF6 ubiquitination. The domain required for degradation of MAST205 after Fcγ receptor activation resides within the N-terminal 261 residues, and degradation is triggered by protein kinase C isoform phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues. These results suggest that MAST205 functions as a scaffolding protein controlling TRAF6 activity and, therefore, plays an important role in regulating inflammatory responses.

At neuromuscular synapses MAST205 interacts with β-2 syntrophin (1Walden P.D. Cowan N.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7625-7635Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 2Lumeng C. Phelps S. Crawford G.E. Walden P.D. Barald K. Chamberlain J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In addition to a well conserved protein kinase C/A kinase domain, MAST205 has a PDZ domain, a protein-protein recognition module (3Sheng M. Sala C. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The role of MAST205 in cellular physiology, however, has yet to be determined. We have found that MAST205 plays a central role in the regulation of LPS-induced cytokine responses of macrophages (4Zhou H. Xiong H. Li H. Plevy S.E. Walden P.D. Sassaroli M. Prestwich G.D. Unkeless J.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this paper we analyze in greater detail the position of MAST205 in LPS-induced signal pathways and the factors regulating stability of the protein. Macrophages respond to LPS by secreting proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-12. IL-12, in particular, is required for the induction of a T helper 1 response that facilitates the clearance of intracellular pathogens. The signal cascade leading to the inflammatory response is complex, reflecting both the importance of controlling the synthesis of potentially harmful cytokines and metabolites, such as reactive oxygen intermediates, and the need to tailor the response depending on the pathogen (5Sanjo H. Takeda K. Tsujimura T. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The inflammatory response is also influenced by previous physiological stimuli to the responding cells, which has lent credence to the concept of macrophage subsets. For example, LPS-stimulated synthesis of IL-12 by macrophages, which is required for the induction of interferon-γ from NK cells (6Trinchieri G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2207) Google Scholar), is inhibited by immune complex activation of FcγR. As a result, such type II macrophages (7Anderson C.F. Mosser D.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2002; 72: 101-106PubMed Google Scholar) as antigen presenting cells drive the synthesis of IL-4 by T cells and murine IgG1 by B cells, characteristics of a T helper 2 response. TRAF6, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, plays a pivotal role in the activation of downstream kinases in the IKK complex. TRAF6 catalyzes the formation of Lys-63-coupled polyubiquitin chains, and a ubiquitin K63R mutant inhibits signaling by the IL-1 receptor, which shares many signaling components with TLR4, including TRAF6 (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanism by which Lys-63 polyubiquitin chains activate downstream components is not clear nor is the mechanism by which upstream interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase kinases control TRAF6. Therefore, characterization of novel TRAF6-interacting proteins may shed light on these critical events in inflammatory pathways. Dominant negative MAST205 mutants and RNAi constructs targeting MAST205 inhibit LPS-induced IL-12 p40 synthesis and NF-κB activation (4Zhou H. Xiong H. Li H. Plevy S.E. Walden P.D. Sassaroli M. Prestwich G.D. Unkeless J.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), showing that MAST205 is involved in the modulation of the innate immune response. Previous epistasis experiments suggested that MAST205 acted before the IKK complex in the LPS/TLR4 signal pathway. In agreement with these results we find that MAST205 forms a complex with TRAF6, regulating both the expression of MAST205 and the activity of TRAF6. Furthermore, FcγR ligation results in the rapid disappearance of MAST205 due to targeted degradation by the proteasome, a mechanism used to control expression of many short-lived proteins that control the cell cycle, transcription, and inflammation (9Karin M. Lin A. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2422) Google Scholar, 10Pickart C.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 544-548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We report that MAST205 degradation is determined by the N-terminal domain and is regulated by phosphorylation. These results provide a clear mechanistic link between the adaptive and innate immune responses whereby immune complexes influence the subsequent mix of inflammatory cytokines synthesized in response to LPS. Modulation of MAST205 degradation and/or complex formation with other signaling components is, therefore, of potential therapeutic promise. Reagents and Antibodies—CBZ-Leu-Leu-Leu-al (MG132), lactacystin, E64d, caspase inhibitor II, pepstatin, wortmannin, SB203580, O-phenanthroline, and okadaic acid were purchased from Calbiochem; TPCK, 4-aminidophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and poly(I·C) were from Sigma. A rabbit anti-MAST205 serum was generated by immunization with a 45-kDa glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 241–340 of MAST205. Antibodies against β-actin and ubiquitin mAb P4D1 were obtained from Santa Cruz; the hemagglutinin (HA) mAb 12CA5 was from Roche Applied Science; the FLAG mAb M2 was from Sigma; the Myc antibody 9E10 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Antennapedia peptides were synthesized with the N-terminal antennapedia sequence RQIKIWFQNRRMKWKK followed by 218ST-ENVPDEEGRRSPR (peptide 1) or the 188VSSSCSSQEKLHQL (peptide 2) Peptides were synthesized on a Symphony (Protein Technologies) peptide synthesizer at a 25 μm scale using a double-coupling protocol and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography on a C18 column developed with a 1–75% acetonitrile gradient. Purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at –20 °C under nitrogen. When required, peptides were dissolved in water to a final concentration of 1–3 mm. The identity of the peptides was verified by mass spectrometry. Plasmids—MAST205 full-length cDNA or and truncated cDNA fragments were inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1. The HA-ubiquitin plasmid and HA-ubiquitin mutant plasmids K48R, K29R, and K63R were kindly provided by Dr. Ze'ev Ronai (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). Plasmids encoding TRAF2, TRAF6, and MyD88 were from Dr. Adrian Ting (Mount Sinai School of Medicine). The TIRAP plasmid was kindly provided by Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov (Yale School of Medicine). Cell Lines—The RAW264.7 murine macrophage cell line (American Type Culture Collection) and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 293T cells were transiently transfected using DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate. For each transfection, 10–20 μg of plasmid was used. NF-κB Promoter Assay—RAW264.7 cells were transiently transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). For each transfection, 2.5 μg of plasmid was mixed with 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without serum and antibiotics) and 10 μl of Superfect reagent, incubated at room temperature for 10 min, mixed with 600 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complete medium, and immediately added to the cells in 6-well plates. Luciferase activity was measured 16–24 h later. When indicated, LPS (1 μg/ml) was added to the culture for 6–12 h before harvest. The cells were extracted with reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and 20 μl of extract was assayed for luciferase as described (11Plevy S.E. Gemberling J.H. Hsu S. Dorner A.J. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4572-4588Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Cells were co-transfected with a constitutively active cytomegalovirus promoter-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid to normalize experiments for transfection efficiency. Western Blotting—Cell lysates and prestained molecular weight markers were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (Triton-containing Tris-buffered saline), incubated with various antibodies (1:2000) for 1–2 h, washed with TBST, and stained with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG conjugated to peroxidase (1:5000). Immunoreactivity was visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL kit, Santa Cruz). Retroviral Transduction—Human 293 Ebna T cells seeded at a density of 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish were cultured overnight and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitate with 2.5 μg of plasmid pMD.G, encoding vesicular stomatitis virus G protein, 7.5 μg of pM-D.OGP, encoding gag-pol, and 10 μg of retroviral expressing construct, encoding Myc-tagged full-length MAST205, BX-MAST205, and N-terminal truncations of MAST205. After 48 h the viral supernatant was used to transduce J774 cell in the presence of 5 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma), and cells were cultured for 48 h before assay. Immunoprecipitation—Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of ice-cold buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol. 1 mm EGTA, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol) with protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml chymostatin and leupeptin). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min at 4 °C). Protein concentration was determined by Coomassie Protein Assay (Pierce). The lysates were incubated with 5 μg of normal mouse IgG for 2 h with intermittent agitation at 4 °C. After 1hat4 °C the lysates were precleared by the addition of 15 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was incubated with 4 μg of anti-Myc mAb, and further steps were carried out as described above for the pre-clearing. Immune complexes were collected on protein G-Sepharose, which were eluted by boiling in SDS-sample buffer, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto nitrocellulose. Membranes were blocked with 10% nonfat milk in PBS, 0.5% Triton-100, and incubated overnight with rabbit anti-MAST205 serum, anti-Myc, or anti-HA mAb. After washing, blots were incubated for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody, rinsed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton-100 and developed with super-signal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). FcγR Ligation—J774 cells were seeded on glass dishes covalently coupled with trinitrophenyl-bovine serum albumin (12Werb Z. Tremble P.M. Behrendtsen O. Crowley E. Damsky C.H. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 877-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), and 5 μg/ml anti-DNP IgG2b mAb U12.5 was added to cross-link FcγR. MAST205 Interacts with TRAF6—Previous results suggested that the locus of MAST205 in the TLR4-signaling pathway was proximal to the IKK complex. A dominant negative (DN) N-terminal deletion mutant of MAST205, BX-MAST205, had no effect on NF-κB activation after ectopic expression of IKK-β (4Zhou H. Xiong H. Li H. Plevy S.E. Walden P.D. Sassaroli M. Prestwich G.D. Unkeless J.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but BX-MAST205 inhibited NF-κB activation stimulated by LPS or a constitutively active TLR4 chimera. To characterize the pathway in more detail, we co-transfected MAST205 with molecules known to play a role in the TLR4 signaling. Remarkably, we found that immunoprecipitation of Myc-MAST205 resulted in co-precipitation of AU1 epitopetagged TRAF6 and TRAF2 (Fig. 1A). In addition, co-expression of TRAF6 or TRAF2 with MAST205 resulted in a significant increase in MAST205 expression (Fig. 1B). Quantification of a series of co-transfection experiments of 293T cells with TRAF6 showed a 10–20-fold increase in expression of MAST205. Co-transfection of TRAF2 also resulted in an increase in MAST205 expression, although more modest than that seen with TRAF6. These results demonstrate that exogenously expressed TRAF6 and MAST205 interact. TRAF6-induced NF-κB Activity Is Inhibited by MAST205— TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a typical ring domain, and the enzyme functions together with an E2 complex consisting of Ubc13 and Uev1A to catalyze synthesis of Lys-63 linked polyubiquitin chains (8Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1470) Google Scholar). The substrates for TRAF6 include TRAF6 itself (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) and the TAK1-associated proteins TAB2 and TAB3 (14Ishitani T. Takaesu G. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Shibuya H. Gaynor R.B. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6277-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). We next analyzed the effect of the MAST205·TRAF6 complex on TRAF6 activation of NF-κB. As expected, overexpression of TRAF6 resulted in a substantial (22-fold) stimulation of NF-κB reporter activity, which is independent of LPS stimulation. However, the TRAF6 activation of the NF-κB reporter was largely inhibited by co-expression of MAST205 (88%) and the N-terminal BX-MAST205 deletion mutant (92%) (Fig. 2A). This result shows that the formation of a complex with MAST205 negatively regulates TRAF6 activity and also suggests that there is also a TRAF6 binding site in BX-MAST205 mutant. Because these results point to the locus of MAST205 acting at the level of TRAF6, we would predict that NF-κB activation due to overexpression of upstream components in the signal pathway would also be inhibited by BX-MAST205. NF-κB activation in RAW264.7 cells observed after transfection of MyD88 and TIRAP was inhibited by co-transfection of BX-MAST205 as we would predict (Fig. 2B). In addition, NF-κB activation due to poly(I·C) stimulation, which activates TLR3, is inhibited by BX-MAST205 (Fig. 2C). Thus, MAST205 also plays a role in TLR3 signal pathways, which differ significantly from other TLRs in utilizing the kinase receptor interacting protein and the adapter TRIF (15Jiang Z. Mak T.W. Sen G. Li X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 3533-3538Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 16Meylan E. Burns K. Hofmann K. Blancheteau V. Martinon F. Kelliher M. Tschopp J. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 503-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). MAST205 Peptides Modulate NF-κB Activation and Alter Complex Formation with TRAF6—Protein transduction domains (17Derossi D. Calvet S. Trembleau A. Brunissen A. Chassaing G. Prochiantz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18188-18193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (943) Google Scholar) have been used to deliver peptides and small proteins to cells by an energy- and receptor-independent mechanism with the aim of interfering in signaling processes. Examples include protein transduction domain peptides directed against STAT3 (18Turkson J. Ryan D. Kim J.S. Zhang Y. Chen Z. Haura E. Laudano A. Sebti S. Hamilton A.D. Jove R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45443-45455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (19Kelemen B.R. Hsiao K. Goueli S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8741-8748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and NF-κB (20Takada Y. Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15096-15104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). To analyze the importance of the N terminus of MAST205, we synthesized protein transduction domain MAST205 peptides targeting a high scoring PEST sequence, thought to control proteasomal degradation (21Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1390) Google Scholar) (residues 218–233; peptide 1) and a potential TRAF2 binding epitope (residues 188–201; peptide 2). We analyzed the effect of these peptides on LPS-stimulated NF-κB reporter activation and found that peptide 1 inhibited LPS-induced NF-κB activity by 50%, whereas peptide 2 resulted in 20% stimulation (Fig. 3A). These results are comparable to those obtained previously using RNAi to target MAST205 in J774 cells and show that MAST205 is an appropriate target for modulation of inflammatory response by cell-permeable peptides. As another test for complex formation between MAST205 and TRAF6, we analyzed the complex of MAST205 and TRAF6 by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography. TRAF6 forms a trimer in solution (22Pullen S.S. Labadia M.E. Ingraham R.H. McWhirter S.M. Everdeen D.S. Alber T. Crute J.J. Kehry M.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 10168-10177Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and hence, the predicted size of a TRAF6·MAST205 complex, assuming each TRAF6 monomer binds one molecule of MAST205, would be 789 kDa. After fractionation of lysates from 293T cells co-transfected with TRAF6 and MAST205, the two proteins were always found associated, eluting over a wide range of Mr (Fig. 3B) with a substantial amount in advance of the 699-kDa thyroglobulin marker. At the predicted Mr for the TRAF6 trimer no staining of TRAF6 was observed. We next analyzed the effect of peptide 1 on complex formation. Preincubation with peptide 1 (30 μm) resulted in a dramatic shift in the MAST205·TRAF6 complex to a higher Mr (Fig. 3C). This result demonstrates that the peptide alters the composition of the complex. We next tested the effect of co-expression of MAST205 and peptide 1 on TRAF6 ubiquitination, since ubiquitination of TRAF6 is central to NF-κB activation. 293T cells were co-transfected with MAST205 and TRAF6 and analyzed for ubiquitination of TRAF6 after immunoprecipitation. Transfected TRAF6 was ubiquitinated (Fig. 3D), and after co-transfection with MAST205 the extent of ubiquitination was clearly increased. The result is consistent with the hypothesis that MAST205, acting as a scaffolding protein, facilitates transubiquitination. However, the addition of peptide 1 inhibited TRAF6 ubiquitination. The localization of peptide 1 within the PEST sequence present in the N terminus of MAST205 is consistent with inhibition of ubiquitination, assuming that the N terminus is required for binding of E2/E3 enzymes required for TRAF6 ubiquitination. In response to activation of TLRs or IL-1R, TRAF6 is ubiquitinated by K63 polyubiquitin chains, resulting in down-stream activation of NF-κB (13Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar, 23Jensen L.E. Whitehead A.S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 553: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that BX-MAST205 inhibition of NF-κB might be due to blockade of TRAF6 ubiquitination. To test this possibility we transfected 293T cells with TRAF6, BX-MAST205, and HA-ubiquitin and analyzed TRAF6 ubiquitination after immunoprecipitation of TRAF6 by blotting for HA. The BX-MAST205 deletion mutant inhibits ubiquitination of TRAF6 under conditions where there is no alteration in the levels of general HA-ubiquitin incorporated into proteins or in the expression of TRAF6 (Fig. 3E). We conclude that the MAST205 N-terminal domain is required to assemble complexes required for TRAF6 ubiquitination. Stabilization of MAST205 Protein by TRAF6—We reported that FcγR ligation resulted in rapid ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MAST205. In a series of transfection and transduction studies of MAST205 in both macrophages and 293T cells, we always observed a low level of MAST205 expression relative to other constructs driven by the same CMV or retroviral promoters. We transduced J774 cells with Myc-MAST205 incubated with cycloheximide to block de novo protein synthesis and determined the t½ of Myc-MAST205 degradation (Fig. 4A). Even in the absence of FcγR ligation, the rate of degradation of the protein was surprisingly rapid (t½ = 35 min) (Fig. 4B), and degradation was blocked by incubation with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4A). Lactacystin, another proteasome inhibitor with greater specificity (24Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1492) Google Scholar), also blocked degradation, but E-64d, TPCK, 4-aminidophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, O-phenanthroline, and caspase inhibitor II were without effect (not shown). Interestingly, co-transduction with TRAF6 in J774 cells stabilized MAST205 protein (t½ = 77 min) relative to the control (Fig 4, C and D). The actual t½ of MAST205 in the presence of TRAF6 may be even longer. The retroviral transduction efficiency (assessed by a parallel green fluorescent protein transduction) is about 70%, and therefore, those cells transduced with MAST205, but not with TRAF6, in which the rate of degradation is more rapid, will contribute significantly to the overall rate of degradation. Because we had found that knocking down MAST205 expression by RNAi targeting resulted in an inhibition of LPS-stimulated NF-κB reporter activity (4Zhou H. Xiong H. Li H. Plevy S.E. Walden P.D. Sassaroli M. Prestwich G.D. Unkeless J.C. J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 2559-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we thought further study of the mechanism of MAST205 degradation was warranted. We have observed that after retroviral transduction of J774 cells, the BX-MAST205 deletion mutant, which lacks the N-terminal 416 amino acids, was expressed at far higher levels than is MAST205 or a mutant in which the ATP binding domain of the kinase was inactivated (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the addition of MG132 resulted in a significant increase in the expression of the latter two proteins accompanied by a shift to higher Mr, consistent with ubiquitination. In contrast, the level of expression of BX-MAST205 was not altered by MG132 nor was any shift in Mr seen. These results suggest that the reason for the dramatic difference in expression of the BX-MAST205 mutant compared with MAST205 was due to the lack of ubiquitination of BX-MAST205, which consequently was much more stable. To confirm the hypothesis that BX-MAST205 is not ubiquitinated, we co-transfected 293T cells with Myc-labeled MAST205 or BX-MAST205 and HA-tagged ubiquitin, immunoprecipitated cell lysates with anti-Myc mAb, and immunoblotted the resulting precipitates with anti-HA mAb. MAST205 shows a low level of constitutive ubiquitination, which was greatly increased after a 2-h incubation with MG132 (Fig. 5B). Under the same conditions BX-MAST205 is not ubiquitinated. Thus, we hypothesize that the N terminus of MAST205 controls the degradation of the kinase. However, ubiquitin can serve other functions besides triggering degradation, and not all proteins that are degraded by the proteasome are ubiquitinated. Polyubiquitination leading to protein degradation occurs predominantly through isopeptide linkage to ubiquitin lysine 48 and, secondarily, to lysine 29 (25Koegl M. Hoppe T. Schlenker S. Ulrich H.D. Mayer T.U. Jentsch S. Cell. 1999; 96: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To prove conclusively that the ubiquitination of MAST205 leads to degradation, we examined the effect of a set of HA-tagged ubiquitin mutants in which the lysines 29, 48, and 63 were mutated to arginine. By immunoblotting lysates for HA reactivity (not shown) we confirmed that each of the HA-ubiquitin mutants was comparably expressed. Co-transfection of 293T cells with Myc-MAST205 and the HA-ubiquitin mutants showed that both the K29R and K48R ubiquitin mutants increased the level of expression of MAST205 relative to the control; the K63R ubiquitin mutant was without effect (Fig. 5C). Phosphorylation Controls the Rate of Degradation of MAST205—Ubiquitination, regulated by phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues to create docking sites for E3 ubiquitin ligases, often serves to control degradation. Because FcγR ligation induces Ser/Thr kinase activity, we analyzed the role of phosphatases in MAST205 degradation. We first tested the inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2a, okadaic acid. We reasoned that inhibition of dephosphorylation would result in more rapid MAST205 degradation if constitutive phosphorylation of Ser/Thr residues targeted degradation. Indeed, we observed that incubation with okadaic acid resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of MAST205 expression in macrophages transduced with MAST205, without any effect on actin expression (Fig. 6A). The enhanced rate of degradation of MAST205 found after incubation with okadaic acid suggests that Ser/Thr kinase activity regulates degradation. Dibutyryl cyclic AMP, which activates protein kinase A, had no effect on degradation. However, incubation with phorbol myristate acetate significantly inhibited expression of transduced MAST205 in J774 cells. Ionomycin alone had a modest effect, and the combination of ionomycin and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) resulted in slightly more inhibition than either alone (Fig. 6B). These results suggest strongly that an isomer of protein kinase C is responsible for the proteasome-mediated degradation of MAST205. Because FcγR ligation is reported to activate protein kinase B/Akt (26Tilton B. Andjelkovic M. Didichenko S.A. Hemmings B.A. Thelen M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28096-28101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we also tested the effects of wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and of SB203580, which inhibits Akt with an IC50 of 3–5 μm in addition to inhibiting p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase at a 10-fold lower concentration (27Lali F.V.

ADP-ribosylation factors (Arfs) are 21-kDa GTPases that regulate aspects of membrane traffic in all eukaryotic cells. An essential component of the biological actions of Arfs is their ability to reversibly bind to membranes, a process that involves exposure of the myristoylated N-terminal amphipathic α-helix upon activation and GTP binding. Deletion of this helix results in a protein, termed Δ17Arf1, that has a reduced affinity for GDP and the ability to bind GTP in the absence of lipids or detergents. Previous studies, comparing crystal structures for Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GTP, identified several regions of structural variation and suggested that these be associated with nucleotide exchange rather than removal of the N-terminal helix. However, separation of conformational changes because of nucleotide binding and N-terminal truncation cannot be addressed in comparing these structures, because both the bound nucleotide and the N terminus differ. Resolving the two effects is important as any structural changes involving the N terminus may represent membrane-mediated conformational adjustments that precede GTP binding. Results from NMR experiments presented here on Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GDP in solution reveal substantial structural differences that can only be associated with N-terminal truncation.

Although the changes in protein structure that accompany nucleotide exchange are critical aspects of all regulatory GTPases, they are particularly important to Arfs, which directly couple the activation process to membrane translocation (8Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 9Pasqualato S. Menetrey J. Franco M. Cherfils J.

Indeed, the formation of activated Arf on a membrane surface is viewed as the initial event that nucleates the formation of a coated bud and subsequent coated vesicle. Biochemical information pairing the nucleotide binding cycle to membrane interactions provides evidence for this pivotal role of the N-terminal helix and attached acyl chain. We present here structural data relevant to this process. Current proposed mechanisms whereby both the myristoyl chain and the N-terminal helix are exposed are based on a detailed comparison of the full-length, nonmyristoylated, and GDP-bound x-ray crystal structure (later referred to as Arf1·GDP) (11Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) to other nonmyristoylated structures. Specifically, a truncated form of Arf1 lacks both the N-terminal helix and the myristoyl chain and is bound to a nonhydrolyzable GTP analog Gpp(NH)p (later referred to as Δ17Arf1·GTP); a truncated apoArf form lacks nucleotides as well as the terminal helix that is bound to the catalytic Sec 7 homology domain of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Gea2 (8Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Structurally Arfs, as represented in the Arf1·GDP crystal structure (11Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D. Nature. 1994; 372: 704-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A), consist of a mixed parallel/antiparallel 6 β-strand core surrounded by 6 α-helices and 12 connecting loops. Residues 2–17 constitute the aforementioned N-terminal, amphipathic α-helix (αNt) and flexible connecting loop region (LNt, found adjacent to αNt, not labeled, however). The myristoyl chain, when present, is attached at residue 2, the N-terminal glycine (11Amor J.C. Harrison D.H. Kahn R.A. Ringe D.

The N-terminal helix as a whole lies in a cleft parallel to the C-terminal helix (αCt) located on the side of the protein opposite the nucleotide-binding site (8Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 95: 237-248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 15Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol.

The residues involved in nucleotide binding include and are labeled as phosphate-binding loop residues (P-loop, residues 26–30) and the guanine base-binding motif (G3Motif, residues 126, 127, and 129). Connecting the nucleotide-binding site and the N-terminal helix are distinctive switch regions (termed SW1, SW2, and the inter-switch by analogy to Ras proteins (17Reinstein J. Schlichting I. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7451-7459Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Lacal J. McCormick F. The Ras Superfamily of GTPases.

These change conformation in response to the bound nucleotide. Switch 1 (SW1, residues 42–54), forms a seventh β-strand at the periphery of β2 in Arf1·GDP. Additionally, residues 70–85 referred to as switch 2 (SW2) have been suggested to undergo a transition from an extended loop to a more ordered helical segment as a result of nucleotide exchange (1Kahn R.A. Yucel J.K. Malhotra V. Cell. 1993; 75: 1045-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Finally, the inter-switch β-strands (ISR, defined as β2, β3, and L2/3 (residues 51–68)), undergoing the largest degree of observed conformational change, are displaced by 7 Å, thus allowing for occupation of the cleft used for binding the N-terminal helix, vacated upon the N-terminal helix release (20Renault L. Guibert B. Cherfils J. Nature. 2003; 426: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). As Δ17Arf1·GTP differs from Arf1·GDP with respect to both the N-terminal helix and the bound nucleotide, it is difficult to differentiate changes associated with nucleotide exchange and truncation. In solution it is possible to examine a third form of Arf1, Δ17Arf1·GDP, which allows for separation of these associated changes by direct comparison to crystal structures differing in nucleotide (Δ17Arf1·GTP) and differing by truncation (Arf1·GDP). We have carried out this examination by using chemical shift perturbations of heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra, changes in amide proton exchange rates, and residual dipolar couplings (RDCs), all collected from NMR data on a 15N-labeled form of the protein. In particular, measured residual dipolar couplings from Δ17Arf1·GDP, along with calculated values from the crystal structures of Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GTP, have allowed production of a structural model for Δ17Arf1·GDP and have made it possible to discern which changes are likely to be a direct result of nucleotide exchange as opposed to those derived from truncation. Residual dipolar couplings arise from a through-space interaction between pairs of magnetic nuclei. They are easily observed in 15N-labeled proteins as additional contributions to splittings of amide nitrogen-amide proton cross-peaks in HSQC experiments when proteins are oriented in field-ordered liquid crystals. The contributions are dependent both on the distance (r) between the nuclei and the angle (θ) between the internuclear vector and the magnetic field. When the distance is fixed, as in a directly bonded pair, the splitting of the NMR resonances for the two nuclei, i and j, due to residual dipolar coupling is given by Equation 1.DRESij=Dmaxij〈(3cos2θ−1)/2〉(Eq. 1) Here Dmaxij is the dipolar coupling between the nuclei in a perfectly ordered system with θ = 0. Averaging over allowed orientations, as denoted by the parentheses, greatly reduces the observed values, but the residual values can be analyzed to provide both structural information and the nature of molecular order when sufficient measurements can be made (21Prestegard J.H. Al-Hashimi H.M. Tolman J.R. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2000; 33: 371-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 22Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 127-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The structural information is complementary to distance constraints normally derived from 1H-1H NOEs but can also be used independently when suitable starting structures are available. In cases where structural homology is considered high, incorporation of constraints on individual bond vector orientations as penalty functions in refinement processes can result in the generation of model structures from experimental data. Penalty functions require the back calculation of RDCs from the coordinates of bond vectors in trial structures. These couplings can be expressed in terms of direction cosines, cos θkij, relating various interaction vectors, ij, to the axes, k, of an arbitrarily chosen fragment frame as shown in Equation 2.Dij=Dmaxij∑Sklcosθkijcosθlij(Eq. 2) Here the degree of order within the system is represented by the molecular order parameters Skl. These form a traceless symmetric matrix that allows only five of the order parameters to be independent. When RDCs can be measured for a sufficient number of vectors within a rigid molecular fragment (a conserved portion of a protein structure), a complete evaluation of the elements of the order matrix can be achieved. The independent order parameters can be translated into Euler angles needed to rotate the molecule into a principal alignment frame where the two remaining parameters can be associated with the principal order parameter in this new frame, Szz', and the asymmetry of order in this frame, η=(Syy'−Sxx')/Szz'. In the following, we propose a solution structure of Δ17Arf1·GDP derived by incorporation of RDC-associated penalty functions into an energy minimization protocol. We use this structure to assess regions of Δ17Arf1·GDP that deviate when compared with both the Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GTP crystal structures. The former comparison identifies structural differences that can be associated with N-terminal truncation, and the latter comparison identifies differences that can be associated with nucleotide exchange. The differences are supported by a limited set of NOE data in some critical aspects of the structure. Additional data showing differences in amide exchange rates between full-length Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GDP also highlight subtle changes in the nucleotide-binding pocket that may be responsible for the alteration in relative affinities for GDP and GTP on truncation. Sample Preparation—BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with the expression plasmid for Δ17Arf1 (pOW14) or Arf1 (pOW12), respectively, in media containing 60 μg/ml ampicillin incubated at 37 °C. Both sets of transformed cells were grown in 3 ml of LB/Amp to saturation, collected, and placed in 50 ml of LB/Amp and grown to an A600 of 0.6. Cells were collected, resuspended, and added to 1 liter of MOPS/Amp media (23Neidhart F.C. Bloch P.L. Smith D.F. J. Bacteriol. 1974; 119: 736Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supplemented with 1× of vitamin mix (Invitrogen, catalog number 11120-052), adding 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl and 2 g/liter [13C6]glucose (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories) (Δ17Arf1) or 4 g/liter glucose (Arf1). Protein expression was initiated by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.5 mm (at A600 of 1.0) and incubated for an additional 3–5 h. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of TM buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, at room temperature (RT)), broken using a French press at 20–25,000 pounds/square inch, and subsequently clarified by centrifugation (100,000 × g, 1 h). Proteins were purified in two chromatographic steps. The first step was by using a 50-ml Q resin column (Bio-Rad, Q-macro, high substitution) equilibrated in TM buffer (20 mm Tris, 2 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6, at RT) and resolved with a 20% gradient of TMN buffer (containing 1 m NaCl). In the second step proteins were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 ml and loaded onto a 60-cm, 120-ml Superdex-75 column (Amersham Biosciences) and resolved at 1.0 ml/min with phosphate buffer (10 mm KPO4, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm NaN3, pH 7.0, at RT). Nucleotide exchange on Δ17Arf1 was achieved by incubating the protein with a 50- or 10-fold molar excess of GDP or GTP (not an analog), respectively, including 10 mm EDTA and incubating the reaction either overnight at RT for GDP or for 60 min at RT for GTP. Exchange reactions were quenched by addition of 30 mm MgCl2. Excess nucleotide, EDTA, and MgCl2 were removed by chromatography on a Superdex-75 column using phosphate buffer. Protein-containing fractions were pooled and concentrated to a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples used for triple resonance assignment (Δ17Arf1·GDP) and HSQC-NOESY experiments (Δ17Arf1·GDP and Arf1·GDP) contained 0.5 mm protein in potassium phosphate buffer (mentioned above) with 10% 2H2O added to provide a lock signal. The samples for measurement of residual dipolar couplings were prepared as follows. Arf1·GDP was prepared to be 0.5 mm protein in the aforementioned phosphate buffer with 10% 2H2O added to provide a lock signal. The 7% (w/v) bicelle solution contained dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine at a 2.8:1 molar ratio doped with dimyristoylphosphoglycerol (15:1 dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine/dimyristoylphosphoglycerol). This gave a 13.8-Hz splitting of the 2H NMR signal from 10% 2H2O in the sample at 305 K. The sample of Δ17Arf1·GDP was prepared to be 0.5 mm protein, again in the aforementioned phosphate buffer. The 7.5% (w/v) ether bicelle solution contained 1,2-di-O-tetradecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine/1,2-di-O-hexyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at a 3:1 molar ratio. This gave a 15-Hz splitting of the 2H NMR signal from 10% 2H2O in the sample at 303 K. A similar sample using 4% pentaethylene glycol octyl ether (C8E5):octanol (Sigma) having a molar ratio (r) of 1.01, as an alignment medium, was used for additional measurements of dipolar couplings on Δ17Arf1·GDP. The C8E5:octanol system yielded a 14-Hz splitting of the 2H NMR signal from 10% 2H2O present in the sample buffer at 301 K. Due to the heightened affinity for nucleotide triphosphates in truncated Arf1 samples, an assessment of possible contamination from GTP incorporation into the target protein (Δ17Arf1·GDP) was performed. GDP and GTP have distinctive 31P chemical shift values, also reflecting the coordination of Mg2+ when present and allowing for a direct detection of bound nucleotide by observation of phosphorous atoms in the nucleotide itself. The results show Mg2+-coordinated GDP as the bound nucleotide with GDP and trace amounts of inorganic phosphate and GMP found in solution (Table I). Comparing integrated peak intensities of 31P peaks observed in the spectra from GDP to internal standards (inorganic phosphate from sample buffer) indicates greater than 85% occupation of the nucleotide-binding pocket.Table I31P chemical shift values from Arf samplesαβγPiΔ17GDP-9.561-3.612aNo γ-phosphate present2.15Δ 17GDP -(Mg)-9.63-4.34aNo γ-phosphate presentbSuccinate buffer used; therefore, no inorganic phosphate was detected from the bufferFree GDP-10.7-6.3aNo γ-phosphate present2.2Δ 17GTP-9.4-15.1-4.82.12a No γ-phosphate presentb Succinate buffer used; therefore, no inorganic phosphate was detected from the buffer Open table in a new tab NMR Spectroscopy—Spectra for the heteronuclear triple resonance assignment experiments, as well as the coupled in-phase anti-phase 1H-15N HSQC experiments used to measure residual dipolar couplings, were collected on Varian 800- and 600-MHz spectrometers, respectively, using Z-gradient triple resonance probes (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Heteronuclear three-dimensional experiments (including HNCA, HNCACB, CBCACONH, HNCO, and HN(CO)CA) were run at 298 K using standard gradient-assisted pulse sequences as supplied as part of the Varian protein pack. In addition a 15N-edited TOCSY experiment (24Griesinger C. Otting G. Wuthrich K. Ernst R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar, 25Fesik S. Nature. 1988; 332: 865-866Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) provided assignment of most α-proton resonances. 15N-Edited 1H-1H HSQC-NOESY experiments were collected on a Varian 600-MHz spectrometer using a Z-gradient triple resonance probe (Varian Inc, Palo Alto, CA). Experiments were run at 298 K by using standard pulse sequences as supplied as part of the Varian protein pack. Data collection included 1024 t3 points, 24 t2 points, and 64 t1 points, subsequently extended with linear prediction and zero filling to 2048, 64, and 128 points, respectively. The 31P spectra used for analysis of nucleotide content were collected on a Mercury 300-MHz spectrometer, with a Nalorac 4 nucleus probe, using standard one-dimensional experiments having proton decoupling only during acquisition. Relatively long recycle times of 2 s were selected to minimize variations in peak intensities due to differential spin relaxation. 31P chemical shifts were externally referenced to 85% phosphoric acid and internally referenced to 10 mm inorganic phosphate from sample buffer (pH 7.0). The in-phase anti-phase 1H-15N HSQC experiments used to measure RDCs were adapted from a pulse sequence described previously (26Wang Y.X. Marquardt J.L. Wingfield P. Stahl S. Lee-Huang S. Torchia D. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 7385-7386Crossref Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and run under both isotropic (288 K) and partially aligned (303 and 301 K) conditions on both ether bicelle and C8E5 samples. Data collection for the in-phase anti-phase 1H-15N HSQC experiments typically included 1024 t2 points and 256 t1 points, subsequently extended with linear prediction and zero filling to 2048 and 1024 points, respectively. Differences in the splittings from both aligned and isotropic conditions (303 K (ether bicelle)/301 K (C8E5) and 288 K (both)) yielded residual dipolar couplings. 1H-15N Cleanex HSQC experiments were used to identify amide protons that rapidly exchanged with protons from water in both fulllength and Δ17Arf1·GDP samples. Experiments were adapted from a pulse sequence described previously (27Hwang T.-L. Mori S. Shaka A.J. Zijl P.C. M.V. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6203-6204Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and conducted on samples made to be 0.5 mm protein in the aforementioned potassium phosphate buffer. Data collection for the Cleanex 1H-15N HSQC experiments included 2048 t2 points and 128 t1 points subsequently extended with linear prediction and zero filling to 4096 and 512 points, respectively. Data processing, including extraction of residual dipolar couplings, was performed with the nmrPipe/nmrDraw package (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11638) Google Scholar); spectral figures were generated with the NMRview graphics package (29Johnson B. Blevins R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2686) Google Scholar), and molecular graphics were generated using the Pymol Molecular Graphics package (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). RDC Analysis and Back Calculation—Experimental dipolar couplings were initially analyzed using the REDCAT analysis package to allow an evaluation of a principal order frame and order parameters (30Valafar H. Prestegard J.H. J. Magn. Reson. 2004; 167: 228-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Upon obtaining the assignments of the 15N-1H cross-peaks for Δ17Arf1·GDP, elements of the alignment tensor were found by analysis of couplings from 40 assigned peaks in the structurally conserved region. Principal order parameters using Arf1·GDP (or Δ17Arf1·GTP) crystal coordinates obtained from the above analysis are as follows for ether bicelles: Sxx', Syy', and Szz' = 0.00012, 0.00004, and -0.00016 (0.00009, 0.00003, and -0.000093); Euler angles relating the principal order frame to the molecular frame of the crystal structure are α, β, γ = -83, 86, and 50 (-56, 233, and 34). The corresponding parameters for the C8E5 medium were found to be Sxx', Syy', and Szz' = 0.00042, 0.00006, and -0.00048 (0.00026, 0.00010, and -0.00036) and α, β, γ = -44, 85, and 119 (-29, 54, and 122). Residual dipolar couplings were back-calculated for all 15N-1H vectors in both crystal structures (Arf1·GDP and Δ17Arf1·GTP) by using alignment and derived order tensor elements. These couplings, which ranged from -6 to 6 Hz (ether bicelle) and -13 to 15 Hz (C8E5), were compared with experimental couplings to provide an initial evaluation of the similarity of Δ17Arf1·GDP to these structures. Structure Refinement against Dipolar Restraints—Refinement of existing crystal structures for Arf1·GDP, modified by removing the N-terminal helix coordinates, and Δ17Arf1·GTP was performed using the standard energy functions (bond, angle, improper, Van der Waals, and electrostatic) and RDC constraint functions (sani) in the XPLOR-NIH package (31Schwieters C.D. Kuszewski J.J. Tjandra N. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Res. 2003; 160: 66-74Crossref Scopus (1882) Google Scholar). Both starting structures included the bound nucleotide, the coordinated magnesium ion, and explicit water molecules. Refinement made use of a combination of torsion angle minimization (IVM module (32Schwieters C.D. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2001; 152: 288-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar)) and Powell minimization in Cartesian space as described in the literature (33Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2923-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The latter was used to allow full adjustment in position of all atoms, represented as small departures from idealized covalent geometry, in response to the RDC constraints as described below (see “Protocol Validation”). There has been concern that undesired distortion of peptide plane geometry might occur in response to application of RDC constraints on H-N bond vectors using solely Cartesian methods, making torsion or rigid body minimization a preferred procedure. However, it is widely recognized that modest (≤6°) departures from ideal peptide plane geometry can be the result of the local environment within proteins (34MacArthur M.W. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 1180-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and suppression of these expected variations might force compensation in backbone torsion angles upon refinement. As this would lead to a greater degree of φ and Ψ angle variation, refinement first in torsion angle space followed by short rounds of Cartesian minimization was chosen. The force constants for bonds and angular components (angles and improper torsions) were set to 1000 kcal mol-1 Å2 and 500 kcal mol-1 rad2, respectively (33Clore G.M. Schwieters C.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004; 126: 2923-2938Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), resulting in peptide bond distortions well within the expected range (average deviation from planarity of 1.7° and maximum deviation of 6°). Forces used with RDC constraints were adjusted in order to bring agreement between experimental and back-calculated RDCs only within experimental error. In order to incorporate RDC constraints into energy minimization refinement, pseudo-atoms X, Y, Z, and O representing the tensor orientation in each alignment frame were first added to the starting coordinates. These pseudo-atoms were held rigid with respect to one another but allowed rotational degrees of freedom centered on O during refinement. Harmonic well potentials were then added for RDC data (ESANI) along with values of dynamic frequency shift, Da ((1/2)Szz), and rhombicity of 0.0 (0.0), -19.55 (-17.45), 0.51 (0.33), for C8E5 and ether bicelle data, respectively. Minimization progressed using the following schedule. Initial Powell minimization was first carried out in Cartesian space (no dipolar restraints) until convergence. Powell minimization in torsion angle space was then implemented followed by short rounds of Cartesian space minimization with RDC force constants increasing linearly over 500 steps to their final values (2.0 (ether bicelle) and 1.0 (C8E5)) by using 1000 rounds of minimization at each step. Finally, Cartesian minimization (500 steps; no RDC restraints) was carried out to allow for return to ideal covalent geometry, and Powell minimization in torsion angle space, with RDC forces set to their final values for 750 rounds, was used to allow for RDC convergence without disrupting peptide plane geometry. A typical minimization schedule required 2 h on a dual 2.8-GHz Intel xenon system with 2 gigabytes of RAM. The degree of correlation between refined structures and back-calculated data was expressed as both the root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d. in Hz) of data from the best fit correlation line and the Quality factor (Q) (35Cornilescu G. Marquardt J.L. Otiiger M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 6836-6837Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar), defined in Equation 3,Q=r.m.s.(Dcalc−Dobs)/r.m.s.(Dobs)(Eq. 3) where Dobs and Dcalc are observed and calculated one-bond dipolar couplings"
https://openalex.org/W2018182021,"23 S RNA narnavirus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The viral genome (2.9 kb) encodes only its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, p104, and forms a ribonucleoprotein complex with p104 in vivo. Previously we succeeded in generating 23 S RNA virus in yeast from an expression vector containing the entire viral cDNA sequence. Using this system, we have recently identified a bipartite 3′ cis-acting signal for replication. The signal consists of a stretch of four cytidines (Cs) at the 3′ end and a mismatched pair of purines in a stem-loop structure that partially overlaps the terminal four Cs. Although the 3′ terminal and penultimate Cs are not essential for virus launching, the generated viruses efficiently recovered these terminal nucleotides. In this work, we expressed RNA transcripts containing the entire 23 S RNA genome but incapable of generating the virus because of the presence of non-viral extra sequences at the 3′ ends. These transcripts could form complexes with p104 in vivo, and a detailed analysis indicated that the mismatched pair of purines as well as the third and fourth Cs from the viral 3′ end was essential for this complex-forming activity. Given that 23 S RNA virus does not have genes for capsid proteins, the binding of p104 to the viral 3′ end, in addition to the efficient 3′ terminal repair, may play a crucial role in virus persistence by protecting and maintaining the correct viral 3′ end in vivo. 23 S RNA narnavirus is a persistent positive strand RNA virus found in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

For a long-term infection, the viruses must evade host immune responses and limit their cytolytic effects but also need to replicate their genomes to be maintained stably in the cells. It is well known that retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome after its synthesis by the reverse transcriptase. Viral DNA can also be maintained as an extrachromosomal element (1Adams A. Lindahl T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1477-1481Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 2Howley P.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1983; 113: 413-421Google Scholar, 3Lusky M. Botcham M.R. Cell. 1984; 36: 391-401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and its synthesis is linked to the replication of the host chromosome. Although persistent infection also occurs in RNA viruses, such as the clinically important hepatitis A and C viruses, the basis for their persistence, especially how they replicate and maintain their genomes within the host cells, remains to be elucidated. 20 S and 23 S RNA narnaviruses are persistent positive strand RNA viruses found in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (4Wickner R.B. Esteban R. Hillman B.I. Van Regenmortel M.H.V. Fauquet C. Bishop D.H.L. Carsten E. Estes M. Lemon S.M. Maniloff J. Mayo M. McGeoon D. Pringle C. Wickner R.B. Virus Taxonomy. Seventh Report of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. Academic Press, New York2000: 651-656Google Scholar). These viruses were discovered originally as RNA species induced under nitrogen starvation conditions (5Kadowaki K. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1971; 105: 826-830Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wejksnora P.J. Haber J.E. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 246-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As is typical of fungal viruses, they do not kill the host or render phenotypic changes to the host. The viruses share many features. Their RNA genomes are small (2514 and 2891 nt 1The abbreviations used are: nt, nucleotides; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; Cs, cytidines. in 20 S and 23 S RNAs, respectively) and each genome encodes a single protein, a 91-kDa protein (p91) by 20 S RNA and a 104 kDa protein (p104) by 23 S RNA (7Rodríguez-Cousiño N.

Both proteins contain four amino acid motifs well conserved among RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) and these motifs are related most closely to those of RdRps of RNA coliphages (11Esteban R. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban L.M. Prog.Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 155-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The double-stranded forms of 20 S and 23 S RNAs are called W and T, respectively (10Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Solórzano A. Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20363-20371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 12Wesolowski M. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Because 20 S and 23 S RNA viruses do not encode capsid proteins, their RNA genomes are not encapsidated into viral particles (13Widner W.R. Matsumoto Y. Wickner R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2905-2908Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 14Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol.

A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Instead, these RNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes with their cognate RdRps in a 1:1 stoichiometry and reside in the host cytoplasm (14Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). 20 S and 23 S RNA genomes lack 3′-poly(A) tails and have perhaps no cap structures at the 5′ ends, thus resembling intermediates of mRNA decay. Therefore, one of the interesting questions concerning these viruses is how they can reside and persist in the host cytoplasm without their genomes being degraded by the exonucleases involved in mRNA degradation pathways. We succeeded recently in generating 23 S RNA virus in yeast from an expression vector containing the entire 23 S RNA cDNA sequence (15Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The hepatitis δ virus antigenomic ribozyme was directly fused to the 3′ terminus of the viral genome. An active ribozyme as well as an active p104 were essential for virus generation. Using this launching system, we have identified a bipartite cis-acting signal for replication in the 3′ non-coding region of the 23 S RNA genome (16Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The signal consists of a cluster of 4 Cs at the 3′ terminus and a mismatched pair of purines in a stem-loop structure that partially overlaps this cluster of 4 Cs. Any combination of purines at the mismatched pair enabled the RNA to generate 23 S RNA virus; however, eliminating the mismatched pair or substituting the purines by pyrimidines abolished the activity. Although 20 S and 23 S RNAs share the same 5-nt inverted repeats at the 5′ and 3′ termini (GGGGC... GCCCC-OH), the innermost G at the 3′ terminus was not essential for 23 S RNA replication. The terminal and penultimate Cs at the 3′ end were not essential for virus launching; the generated viruses, however, restored these terminal Cs. This indicates that the four Cs at the 3′ end are essential for virus replication and that 23 S RNA virus has an effective 3′ terminal repair mechanism(s) in vivo. In this work, we analyzed the formation of 23 S RNA/p104 ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivo and found that the 3′ bipartite cis-signal for replication (the mismatched pair of purines as well as the third and fourth Cs at the 3′ end) is essential for the binding of p104, thus suggesting physical interactions between them. The formation of complexes, along with the efficient 3′ end repair in vivo, may play an essential role in protecting and maintaining the proper viral 3′ end for 23 S RNA virus persistence. Strains and Media—An L-A-o derivative (2928 L-A-o) of strain 2928 (a ura3 trp1 his3, 20 S RNA, 23 S RNA-o) (17Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used throughout this work. Cells were grown in either rich YPAD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 0.04% adenine, and 2% glucose) or tryptophan-omitted synthetic (H-Trp) medium (18Wickner R.B. Cell. 1980; 21: 217-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Both media were supplemented with uracil at a concentration of 100 μg/ml. Plasmids—All of the 23 S RNA expression plasmids used in this work were derivatives of the 23 S RNA launching plasmids used in the previous study (16Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The original launching plasmids were modified either by deleting the antigenomic hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence fused to the 3′ end of the viral sequence, or by substituting the GGG sequence at the ribozyme cleavage site with AAA by site-directed in vitro mutagenesis (19Esteban R. Fujimura T. Wickner R.B. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 947-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Because the generation of the viral 3′ end by ribozyme cleavage was critical to launch 23 S RNA virus, these derivatives were unable to generate 23 S RNA virus in vivo. All of modifications were confirmed by DNA-sequencing. Immunoprecipitation—Yeast transformants were grown in H-Trp medium and harvested at the logarithmic growing phase. These cells had been grown ∼30 generations after receiving a 23 S RNA expression plasmid to obtain enough quantity. Cells (3 × 108) were washed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl), re-suspended in the same buffer (100 μl) and broken with glass beads by vortex mixing (15 s, 10 times). After adding 350 μl of fresh buffer, the cell suspension was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to remove cell debris and unbroken cells. The lysate was then used 1) to analyze p104 by Western blotting, 2) to extract total 23 S RNA transcripts with phenol for Northern blot analysis, and 3) to immunoprecipitate 23 S RNA transcripts with anti-p104 antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of 23 S RNA transcripts was carried out as follows. To 150 μl of the lysate prepared as described above, 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin (Promega), 2 μg of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen) and 2 μl of anti-p104 antiserum or its preimmune serum were added and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. 25 μl (wet volume) of protein A-conjugated Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to the mixture and it was incubated at 4 °C for another 30 min. The Sepharose was washed three times with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline-Tween 20 and 1 mm dithiothreitol and then suspended in 150 μl of 5 mm EDTA and 0.5% SDS. The RNA bound to Sepharose was extracted with phenol, phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol. The pellet was dissolved in 12 μl of 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, 1 m glyoxal, and 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and incubated at 50 °C for 1 h. The solution was diluted with 150 μl of 10× SSC and blotted onto a Nytran N membrane (Schleicher and Schüll) using a Bio-Dot SF apparatus (Bio-Rad). RNA on the membrane was detected by Northern hybridization as described previously (20Fujimura T. Esteban R. Esteban L.M. Wickner R.B. Cell. 1990; 62: 819-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Treatment of lysates with bentonite was done as follows: to 50 μl of the cell lysate described above, 2.5 μl of bentonite (3% w/v) was added. After a brief incubation at 4 °C, the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 1 min to separate bentonite. p104 in the supernatant was analyzed by Western blotting. Northern Probes—A 23 S RNA positive strand-specific probe was made from SmaI-digested pALI-38 by run-off transcription with T3 RNA polymerase. The probe contained the entire nucleotide sequence of the 23 S RNA negative strand without extra non-viral sequences at both ends (14Solórzano A. Rodríguez-Cousiño N. Esteban R. Fujimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26428-26435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and was used throughout this work unless described otherwise. pRE491, pRE479, and pRE443 contained 5′ XhoI (1-223), BamHI-XhoI (1257-1600), and 3′ SpeI (2750-2891) fragments of the 23 S RNA cDNA sequence, respectively, in the Bluescript-SK+ or -KS+ vector (Stratagene), and were used to make the 5′ end, middle, and 3′ end-specific probes for the 23 S RNA genome. A 0.35 kb EcoRI-SpeI fragment from pI2 vector (17Wickner R.B. Icho T. Fujimura T. Widner W.R. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 155-161Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the KS+ vector (pRE636). This plasmid was used to make a probe to detect the vector sequence downstream of the 23 S RNA genome present in the transcripts immunoprecipitated with anti-p104 antiserum. Antiserum—Anti-p104 antiserum used in this work was described previously (21Esteban L.M. Fujimura T. García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29771-29777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was raised against an N-terminal fragment (amino acids 11 to 265) of p104. Sucrose Gradients—Sucrose gradients (10-40%, w/v) were done as described in Ref. 22García-Cuéllar M.P. Esteban R. Fujimura T. RNA. 1997; 3: 27-36PubMed Google Scholar using a SW40 rotor run at 36,000 rpm for 4 h 30 min at 4 °C. 23 S RNA Expression Plasmids—23 S RNA virus exists in vivo in the form of a ribonucleoprotein complex between the 23 S RNA genome and its RdRp p104. To analyze cis-acting signals for the formation of these complexes we expressed 23 S RNA transcripts from a vector bearing various mutations at the 3′ non-coding region in the viral genome and examined their ability to form complexes in vivo with p104 by an immunoprecipitation assay using anti-p104 antibodies. To avoid any complications derived from 23 S RNA virus generation, we used launching plasmids constructed previously (16Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) but modified them as follows (Fig. 1A). The standard launching plasmid (pRE637) contains the complete 23 S RNA cDNA sequence (2891 base pairs) downstream of the PGK1 promoter. Transcripts from the promoter have the positive polarity of the viral genome. The hepatitis δ virus antigenomic ribozyme is directly fused to the 3′ terminus of the viral genome. The transcription termination site for the FLP gene (23Hartley J.L. Donelson J.E. Nature. 1980; 286: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) of the 2 μm plasmid is located 0.7 kb downstream of the 23 S RNA genome. Because the ribozyme sequence is flanked by two unique restriction sites (SmaI and EcoRI), we digested the plasmid with these enzymes to eliminate the ribozyme. The larger fragment containing the 23 S RNA sequence was Klenow-treated and ligated to produce plasmid pTF662 (Fig. 1A). We have shown previously that an active ribozyme fused to the viral 3′ end was critical for virus generation. Consistently, transcripts from pTF662 failed to generate 23 S RNA virus in vivo even after 100 generations, as judged by the absence of T double-stranded RNA, an indicative of negative strand synthesis, as well as the absence of 23 S RNA after curing the plasmid (data not shown). All the 23 S RNA expression plasmids used in this work except for those shown in Fig. 9 were constructed in this way; they are thus incapable of generating 23 S RNA virus and contained the same flanking sequence to the viral 3′ end. p104 Can Bind to 23 S RNA with Extra Non-viral Sequence at the 3′ End—Yeast cells having no endogenous 23 S RNA virus were transformed with pTF662 or the standard launching plasmid (pRE637). Lysates prepared from growing transformants contained p104 when analyzed by Western blots using anti-p104 antiserum (Fig. 2A). The amount of p104 expressed from the standard launching plasmid was severalfold higher than the one from pTF662. This reflects that a significant proportion of cells (20-50%) transformed with the launching plasmid had already generated 23 S RNA virus (15Esteban R. Fujimura T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2568-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). When p104 in the lysates was immunoprecipitated with anti-p104 antiserum, the precipitates from both transformants were found positive with a 23 S RNA-specific probe in Northern blots (Fig. 2B). Control experiments with the preimmune serum or without serum gave no signals. Because pTF662 does not generate 23 S RNA virus, the results suggest that transcripts from this plasmid can bind to p104 even though they contain extra non-viral sequences at the 3′ ends. To confirm this, we analyzed the transcripts in the immunoprecipitates with a probe specific to the vector sequence downstream of the 23 S RNA genome and also with probes recognizing different parts of the 23 S RNA genome (Fig. 3B). As control, we prepared a lysate from 23 S RNA virus-generated cells from which the launching plasmid (pRE637) had been cured. The three probes specific to different parts of 23 S RNA genome hybridized with RNA extracted from both immunoprecipitates and the relative intensities of the signals between them are quite similar irrespective of whether the probe recognized the 5′, middle, or 3′ portions of the 23 S RNA genome (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that the pTF662 transcripts immunoprecipitated with anti-p104 antiserum contained intact 23 S RNA viral genome. Consistently, the probe specific to the vector sequence flanking the viral 3′ end recognized the transcripts from pTF662 in the immunoprecipitates but not the viral RNA in the control (Fig. 3A). Therefore, these results clearly indicate that p104 could form complexes with transcripts from pTF662 even though they contained extra non-viral sequences at the 3′ ends.Fig. 3p104 can form complexes in vivo with 23 S RNA transcripts containing extra non-viral sequences at the 3′ ends.A, a lysate was prepared from cells expressing transcripts containing 23 S RNA sequence from plasmid pTF662 (Transcript) or from 23 S RNA virus-generated cells from which the launching plasmid pRE637 had been cured (Launched virus). p104/23 S RNA complexes in the lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-p104 antiserum and the 23 S RNA transcripts were detected as described in the legend to Fig. 2B, but with probes specific to different portions of the 23 S RNA genome (5′, Middle, and 3′) or a probe specific to the vector sequence 3′ to 23 S RNA in the transcript (Vector). The relative amounts of pTF662 transcripts to launched viral RNA in the immunoprecipitates detected by the 5′end, middle, and 3′ end probes were 41, 49, and 44%, respectively. B, diagrams of 23 S transcripts expressed from pTF662 and the regions in the transcripts recognized by the probes used in A. 23 S RNA and vector sequences and the poly(A) tail are shown by the filled and thin lines and (A)n, respectively. The 5′ terminal nucleotide of 23 S RNA genome is numbered 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Stem Structure at the Viral 3′ End Is Essential for the Formation of Complexes with p104—The 23 S RNA genome contains a 59-nt untranslated region at the 3′ end. This region can form three stem-loop structures (Fig. 4B). When the nucleotide sequences of each loop (I-III) were modified separately in the vector, none of the modifications significantly affected the formation of complexes between the modified transcripts and p104 (Fig. 4A), although the modification in the loop III sequence also changed the last two amino acids in p104. As shown previously (16Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), these modifications did not affect replication of 23 S RNA virus. In contrast, the change of the fourth C from the 3′ end to a U, an essential nucleotide for replication, abolished the formation of complexes. This suggests an involvement of the bipartite cis signal for replication in the formation of 23 S RNA/p104 complexes. The importance of the stem I structure containing the mismatched pair of purines to form complexes is shown in Fig. 5. When the nucleotide sequence of one side of the lower stem was changed to that of the other side of the stem, or vice versa, thus destroying the lower stem structure, the modified transcripts no longer formed complexes with p104 (lanes 4 and 5). However, exchanging them simultaneously, thus re-establishing the lower stem structure but with nucleotide sequences different from the original ones, restored the activity to form complexes with p104 (lane 6). We obtained the same results concerning the upper stem structure (lanes 1-3). These results, therefore, indicate the importance of the lower and upper stem structures surrounding the mismatched pair of purines in the formation of 23 S RNA/p104 complexes.Fig. 5The 3′ terminal stem structure is essential for the formation of complexes with p104.A, the upper and lower stem sequences of the 3′ terminal stem-loop I in the 23 S RNA expression plasmid were modified as indicated in B. Yeast cells were transformed with the control (lane C) of modified plasmids (lanes 1-6) and lysates were prepared from the transformed cells. 23 S RNA immunoprecipitated with anti-p104 antiserum (Anti-p104) or its preimmune serum (Preimmune) and total RNA extracted from the lysates (Total RNA) were analyzed as described in the legend to Fig. 2B. The effects of the modifications on virus launching observed in the previous work (16Fujimura T. Esteban R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13215-13223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) are indicated on the right. B, wild-type (lane C) and modified (lanes 1-6) nucleotide sequences at the 3′ terminal region of 23 S RNA analyzed in A. Modified nucleotides at the upper (lanes 1-3) or lower (lanes 4-6) stem are indicated by filled circles. The wild-type stem-loop I and restored stem structures by simultaneous exchange of the upper (lane 3) or lower (lane 6) stem sequences are shown on the right with the modified sequences boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) p104 Expression—Because the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes requires 23 S RNA transcripts as well as p104 decoded from them, we examined the expression of p104 in transformants analyzed in Figs. 4 and 5. As shown in Fig. 6, A and C, all of the transformants examined expressed p104. There is, however, variation in the amounts of p104 expressed among them. We noticed that cells expressing 23 S RNA transcripts capable of forming complexes contain higher amounts of p104 compared with cells producing transcripts defective in forming complexes. This may be a mere coincidence, and slight modifications at the 3′ non-coding region might have affected the expression of p104 as observed. On the other hand, because we were detecting the steady state levels of p104, this can be explained in terms of a stabilizing effect on the protein caused by the formation of a ribonucleoprotein complex. Consistent with the latter explanation, we also noticed that the steady state levels of 23 S RNA transcripts were higher when they could form complexes with p104 (Figs. 4 and 5). In the course of experiments, we found that p104, depending on whether it was part of ribonucleoprotein complexes or not, interacted differently with bentonite. When lysates were incubated with bentonite and then centrifuged to remove it, the p104 that was able to form complexes with 23 S RNA transcripts remained in the supernatant, whereas the protein incapable of forming complexes with 23 S RNA transcripts was found to precipitate with bentonite during the centrifugation (Fig. 6, B and D). In both cases, 23 S RNA transcripts remained in the supernatant (not shown). The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear. However, because all p104 in the transformants analyzed in this work contained the same wild-type amino acid sequence (except for the loop III mutant with two amino acids modified at the C terminus), this has to be related with the status of p104 in the lysates. The bulky structure of 23 S RNA transcripts may prevent the bound protein from gaining access to bentonite, or the p104 bound to 23 S RNA transcripts may fold differently from the unbound protein. We ran sucrose gradients to confirm that the immunoprecipitation-Northern blot assay employed in this work faithfully reflected the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes (Fig. 7). As control, we prepared a lysate from plasmid-cured cells carrying 23 S RNA virus generated from the standard launching plasmid (pRE637). The viral RNA and p104 comigrated in the gradient and peaked at fraction 17 (Fig. 7A). 23 S RNA transcripts from pTF662 that had the intact 23 S RNA genome with the 3′ non-viral sequence ran as fast as or slightly faster than the authentic 23 S RNA viral genome, and p104 also peaked at fraction 17 in the gradient (Fig. 7B). 23 S RNA transcripts with a single mutation at the fourth C from the viral 3′ end (C4U) from pTF689 migrated in the gradient with a sedimentation profile indistinguishable from that of the wild-type transcripts. However, p104 expressed from this plasmid, although containing the wild-type amino acid sequence, failed to form complexes with the RNA transcripts and remained at the top of the gradient (Fig. 7C). Therefore, these results confirm that the immunoprecipitation-Northern blot assay used in this work properly reflects the status of the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes in vivo. The Mismatched Pair of Purines Is Essential for Formation of Complexes—The stem-exchange experiments (Fig. 5) indicate that the stem structure of the stem-loop I is important for the formation of complexes. Because the loop sequence was not involved in this complex formation (Fig. 4), these results suggest that the stem structure is necessary to form a platform to mount the mismatched pair of purines that is essential for the formation of 23 S RNA/p104 complexes. To test this possibility, we modified nucleotides at the mismatched pair and examined their effects on the formation of complexes (Fig. 8). When the 5′-A of the mismatched pair was eliminated (lane 1) or replaced with C (lane 3) or U (data not shown), the modified transcripts no longer formed complexes with p104. However, when this A was changed to G, the modified transcripts with the G< >G mismatch could form complexes with p104 with a slightly diminished activity (lane 2). Likewise, changing the 3′-G of the mismatched pair to C (lane 6) or eliminating this nucleotide (lane 4) abolished the complex-forming activity in the modified transcripts. Again, an A could substitute for this G but with a slightly reduced activity (lane 5). These results suggest that the bulged non-base-paired nucleotides at the stem are essential for the formation of complexes and that their bases should be purines. To confirm this, we introduced concerted mutations at the mismatched pair and analyzed their effects on the formation of complexes. Because changing the 5′-A at the mismatched pair to C (lane 3) or U resulted in the elimination of the mismatch from the stem by a C-G or U-G pairing, we changed the wild-type mismatched pair to the pair (C< >A) and found that transcripts bearing these mutations failed to form complexes with p104 (lane 7). This suggests that the 5′ base of the mismatched pair should also be a purine. Consistently, transcripts bearing a A< >A (lane 5) or G< >A (lane 8) mismatched pair formed complexes with p104. Furthermore, transcripts with a U< >U mismatched pair failed to form complexes (data not shown). These results clearly indicate that the bases of the mismatched pair should be purines and that any combination of purines bestowed the activity of forming complexes with p104 on 23 S RNA transcripts. Therefore, 23 S RNA"

We show that the helix 12 of RXRα and RARα is critical for recruitment of the co-regulators and transcriptional regulation by RXRα, RARα, and RXRα/RARα. LG268, an RXR-specific agonist, was able to promote co-activator association with the heterodimers, but was unable to dissociate co-repressors. Reconstitution experiments in yeast demonstrated that LG268 was capable of activating transcription by RXRα/RARα through recruitment of the co-activator. We hypothesize that the inability to release co-repressors from RXRα/RARα is responsible for the inability of LG268 to activate RXRα/RARα heterodimers in mammalian cells. Deletion of RARα helix 12 (RXRα/RARα Δ403) abolished both hormone-dependent dissociation from co-repressors and hormone-dependent association with co-activators. Deletion of RXRα helix 12 (RXRα Δ443/RARα) resulted in a higher binding affinity for co-repressors. Unexpectedly, RXRα Δ443/RARα also gained hormone-independent co-activator binding activity. Moreover, LG268 became an antagonist to RXRα Δ443/RARα heterodimers. These data suggest that the helix 12 of RXRα plays an inhibitory role in the recruitment of co-activators by unliganded RXRα/RARα. Retinoid X receptor (RXR)/retinoic acid receptor (RAR) heterodimers control gene expression through recruitment of co-repressors or co-activators, depending on their hormone binding status. We show that the helix 12 of RXRα and RARα is critical for recruitment of the co-regulators and transcriptional regulation by RXRα, RARα, and RXRα/RARα. LG268, an RXR-specific agonist, was able to promote co-activator association with the heterodimers, but was unable to dissociate co-repressors. Reconstitution experiments in yeast demonstrated that LG268 was capable of activating transcription by RXRα/RARα through recruitment of the co-activator. We hypothesize that the inability to release co-repressors from RXRα/RARα is responsible for the inability of LG268 to activate RXRα/RARα heterodimers in mammalian cells. Deletion of RARα helix 12 (RXRα/RARα Δ403) abolished both hormone-dependent dissociation from co-repressors and hormone-dependent association with co-activators. Deletion of RXRα helix 12 (RXRα Δ443/RARα) resulted in a higher binding affinity for co-repressors. Unexpectedly, RXRα Δ443/RARα also gained hormone-independent co-activator binding activity. Moreover, LG268 became an antagonist to RXRα Δ443/RARα heterodimers. These data suggest that the helix 12 of RXRα plays an inhibitory role in the recruitment of co-activators by unliganded RXRα/RARα. The nuclear hormone receptors comprise a large family of transcription factors that regulate animal development, cell proliferation, and cell differentiation through the control of a network of genes involved in these processes (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

Nuclear receptors harbor two evolutionarily conserved domains, DNA binding domains (DBDs) 1The abbreviations used are: DBD, DNA binding domain; LBD, ligand binding domain; SMRT, silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor; RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; PPAR, peroxisome proliferating activator receptor; AT-RA, all-trans-retinoic acid; Y2H, yeast two-hybrid assay; Y3H, yeast two-hybrid assay; M2H, mammalian two-hybrid assay; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; RID, receptor interaction domain; RARE, retinoic acid response element; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis-retinoc acid; ACTR, activator for thyroid hormone and retinoid receptor; T3, thyroid hormone. and ligand binding domains (LBDs). Whereas the DBD recognizes specific DNA sequences, the LBD dictates transcriptional activity by nuclear receptors through recruitment of co-repressors such as silencing mediator for retinoic acid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) and nuclear receptor co-repressor or co-activators, including p160 family proteins (3Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar). Nuclear hormone receptors have been further subdivided into four classes based on their mode of action and DNA binding status (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). Retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are class II receptors that mediate retinoid signaling by regulating a complex gene network. RARs primarily form heterodimers with RXRs on DR5 (direct repeat spaced by 5 base pairs) or DR1-containing sequences. Conversely, RXRs are capable of forming homodimers on DR1 or heterodimers with other class II nuclear hormone receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). The ability of RXRs to form homodimers or heterodimers with other receptors generates a complex mechanism by which the ligands of RXR may or may not exert effects on target genes, depending on the dimerization partner of the receptor (5Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Receptors such as RARs and TRs (thyroid hormone receptors) dimerize with RXRs, generating a non-permissive complex in which RXR ligands are not capable of activating heterodimers. In such heterodimeric complexes, RXRs are referred to as silent partners. The mechanisms underlying this observation are currently unclear, but it has been proposed that RXRs within these heterodimers cannot bind their agonists (6Forman B.M. Umesono K. Chen J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 541-550Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 7Kurokawa R. DiRenzo J. Boehm M. Sugarman J. Gloss B. Rosenfeld M.G. Heyman R.A. Glass C.K. Nature. 1994; 371: 528-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). In contrast, permissive complexes between peroxisome proliferating activator receptors (PPARs) or vitamin D receptors and RXRs can be activated solely by RXR ligands. Despite divergence in the primary sequences of LBDs of nuclear receptors, the structures of several LBDs are remarkably conserved (8Greschik H. Moras D. Curr. Top Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 1573-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 9Renaud J.P. Moras D. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2000; 57: 1748-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Structural comparison between RXRα apo-LBD (hormone-free) (10Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar) and RXRγ holo-LBD (hormone-bound) (11Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that ligand binding triggers a conformational change within the receptors in which helix 12 of the RXR LBD makes a lid to a cavity containing helices 3, 4, and 5. Recent crystal and molecular studies have suggested that such a conformational change by helix 12 creates an interface for co-activator binding (12Darimont B.D. Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W.

Although the complex structure of the antagonist-bound PPARα and co-repressor peptide has been solved (15Xu H.E. Stanley T.B. Montana V.G. Lambert M.H. Shearer B.G. Cobb J.E. McKee D.D. Galardi C.M.

Nonetheless, biochemical and molecular studies indicate that the binding pockets for co-repressors and co-activators largely overlap (16Hu X.

It is widely believed that, physiologically, class II receptors form high affinity DNA binding transcription factors as heterodimers, rather than as monomers (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar). The high resolution structure of the liganded RXRα/RARα heterodimeric complex is now available (20Bourguet W. Vivat V. Wurtz J.M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 289-298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) and provides insight into the molecular mechanism of dimerization; however, the crystal structure of the apo-heterodimer is currently unavailable, likely due to the unstructured helix 12. Therefore, understanding the roles of the helix 12 of dimerization partners in co-regulator recruitment is key to elucidating the molecular basis of transcriptional regulation by class II receptors. In this report, we map the critical residues in the helix 12 of RARα and RXRα for co-regulator association and transcriptional regulation by both receptors. Interestingly, although several mutants exhibit ligand-independent association with the co-activator, these mutants also acquire ligand-insensitive dissociation from the co-repressor. Our data indicate that LG268, a known RXR-specific ligand, promotes co-activator binding, but not co-repressor dissociation from heterodimers. We also found that RXRα helix 12 mutants displayed mild defects in all-trans-retinoic acid (AT-RA)-induced co-activator recruitment. Unexpectedly, deletion of RXRα helix 12 created a better co-activator binding surface within RXRα Δ443/RARα heterodimers. Furthermore, AT-RA, but not LG268, is capable of promoting recruitment of co-activators by RXRα Δ443/RARα heterodimers. These results indicate the unique requirement of helix 12 of RXRα and RARα for recruitment of co-activators by the RXRα/RARα heterodimer.

Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out to generate RARα helix 12 mutants using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene). All constructs were verified by stranded sequencing to confirm the identity and reading frame. Yeast Methods—Yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays were carried out according to the manufacturer's protocol (Clontech). Liquid β-galactosidase activity was performed, and the values were derived from duplicate with two independent clones. Yeast three-hybrid (Y3H) assays were performed in strain Y190. Transient Transfection Assays—Transient transfection assays were carried out according to our published protocol (17Kao H.Y. Han C.C. Korma A.A. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7366-7373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). CV-1 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 units/ml penicillin G, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate at 37 °C in 7% CO2. For mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) assays, pCMX-Gal4, pCMX-Gal4-SMRT (RID), or pCMX-Gal4-ACTR (RID) was co-transfected with pCMX-VP16, pCMX-VP16-RARα fusion constructs along with pMH100-TK-Luc and 100 ng of pCMX-LacZ. For repression and activation assays, CV-1 cells (60-70% confluence, 48-well plate) were co-transfected with 33 ng of Gal4-RARα and Gal4-RXRα and 100 ng of pMH100-TK-Luc, and 100 ng of pCMX-LacZ in 200 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum by the N-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate-mediated procedure. For DR5-TK-Luc (in Fig. 3), cells were transfected with 33 ng of pCMX-RARα, 100 ng of β-RARE-TK-Luc, and pCMX-LacZ. The amount of DNA in each transfection was kept constant by the addition of pCMX. CV-1 cells were washed and placed in charcoal-stripped serum right before transfection. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with or without all-trans-retinoic acid. Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity 36-48 h after transfection. The luciferase activity was normalized to the level of β-galactosidase activity. Each transfection was performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assays—EMSAs were carried out according to our published protocol (17Kao H.Y. Han C.C.

Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli DH5α and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads. Immobilized GST fusion proteins were eluted by 20 μm glutathione and dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline. RARα, RXRα, and TRβ synthesized in vitro (Promega) were incubated with a 32P-labeled probe containing a response element with or without 1 μm AT-RA. The probes include: DR5, 5′-GGT AGG GTT CAC CGA AAG TTC ACT C-3′; DR1: 5′-GCT TCA GGT CAG AGG TCA GAG AG-3′; DR4: 5′-GGT GGG TCA TCT GAG GTC AG-3′. DNA-protein binding was conducted in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol. After 30 min at 25 °C, the purified GST-SMRT or GST-ACTR fusion proteins were added, followed by an additional 30 min of incubation. The reaction mixtures were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide (29.2:0.8) non-denaturing gel followed by electrophoresis in 0.5× TBE buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, 25 mm EDTA pH 8.0). After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography. Association of RARα Helix 12 Mutants with Co-repressors—To investigate the roles of helix 12 in nuclear receptor function, we focused on helix 12 of RARα and RXRα. Fig. 1A shows an alignment of helix 12 sequences from several class II nuclear receptors. In this study, mutants were generated in the conserved residues of RARα helix 12. We first tested whether these mutants bound SMRT by EMSAs. GST-SMRT (receptor interaction domain (RID)) fusion protein was expressed in bacteria and subsequently affinity-purified (17Kao H.Y. Han C.C. Korma A.A. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7366-7373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). EMSAs were conducted using a 32P-labeled DNA duplex containing a DR5 element of the retinoic acid response element (βRARE) of from human RARβ2 gene. Both RXRα and wild-type or mutant RARα were translated in vitro and incubated with the 32P-labeled probe and purified GST-SMRT in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of AT-RA. Wild-type RARα displayed a dose-dependent hormone-induced dissociation from SMRT (Fig. 1B, lanes 1-4), whereas P408L (lane 9) and E412A (lane 17) bound SMRT weakly, and this binding was dramatically decreased in the presence of 10 nm AT-RA (lanes 10 and 18). Furthermore, RARα Δ403 (lanes 5-8), L409A (lanes 13-16), and M413A (lanes 21-24) did not fully dissociate SMRT, even at 1 μm AT-RA. These data indicate that Pro-408 and Glu-412 play an important role in co-repressor binding and that Leu-409 and Met-413 are critical for hormone-dependent dissociation of co-repressors. We next analyzed the association of co-repressor with helix 12 deletion (Δ403) and point mutants by mammalian two-hybrid (M2H) assays using Gal4-SMRT (RID) and VP-RARα (LBD) along with a reporter construct (pMH100) containing multiple Gal4 binding sites upstream of a TK basal promoter and the firefly luciferase gene. As shown in Fig. 1C, all helix 12 mutants showed high reporter activity, suggesting that these mutants bound SMRT in the absence of all-trans-retinoic acid (AT-RA), although the degree of association varied among the mutants. In the presence of 10 nm AT-RA, wild-type RARα and several of the mutants displayed a dramatic reduction of the reporter activity. In contrast, significant amounts of the reporter activity were detected for RARα Δ403, L409A, and M413A in the presence of 10 nm AT-RA, and 50% of RARα Δ403 was still associated with SMRT at 1 μm AT-RA. These results suggested that RARα Δ403 acquired aberrant ligand-insensitive co-repressor binding. Similarly, the reporter activity was diminished for point mutants L409A and M413A only at 1 μm AT-RA, suggesting that complete dissociation of SMRT required more than 1 μm AT-RA. In contrast, P408L and E412A displayed less reporter activity, indicating that they bound SMRT more weakly than that of wild-type RARα, but this binding was readily disrupted in the presence of 10 nm AT-RA. These results are consistent with those of EMSAs. Hormone-dependent Co-activator Association with RARα Helix 12 Mutants—The ability of RARα helix 12 mutants to recruit co-activators such as ACTR was examined by EMSAs and M2H assays. EMSAs were carried out as described in Fig. 1B except that GST-ACTR (RID) fusion protein was used (Fig. 2A). Wild-type RARα exhibited a hormone-dependent association with ACTR, whereas mutants Δ403 (lanes 5-8), L409A (lanes 13-16), and E412A (lanes 17-20) completely lost ACTR binding activity. Unexpectedly, we found that unliganded P408L bound weakly to ACTR (lane 9) and no further ACTR binding was induced by high concentrations of AT-RA (lanes 10-12). Similarly, M413A also bound ACTR in the absence of ligand (lane 21), although this association was increased by AT-RA in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 22-24). These data suggest that the conserved residues in the helix 12 of RARα are critical for co-activator association. M2H assays were conducted as described in Fig. 1C using pCMX-ACTR (RID) and VP-RARα (LBD). The association of RARα with ACTR was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of AT-RA. In the absence of AT-RA, no reporter activity was detected, suggesting no association with ACTR (RID) was detected for wild-type or any of the mutant RARαs (LBD) (Fig. 2B). In the presence of AT-RA, the reporter activity was increased, indicating that wild-type RARα bound ACTR in a dose-dependent manner. However, we found that all mutants exhibited much lower reporter activity than that of the wild-type even in the presence of 1 μm AT-RA. These data suggested that RARα Δ403, L409A, and E412A possess defects in co-activator binding. Similarly, P408L and M413A dramatically lost their ability to bind ACTR. The aberrant association of these mutants with SMRT and ACTR suggested that RARα helix 12 mutants have a defect in hormone-dependent transcriptional regulation. Transient transfection assays were employed to examine the ability of helix 12 mutants to regulate transcription by RARα. Wild-type and mutant RARα were fused to the yeast Gal4 DNA-binding domain to generate Gal4-RARα (LBD) expression plasmids. The Gal4-RARα (LBD) expression vectors were co-transfected with MH100, and reporter activity was measured in the absence or presence of AT-RA. Our data indicate that all the helix 12 mutants repressed transcription in the absence of hormone (Fig. 3A), although P408L, E412A, and M413A exhibited less repression activity. We also found that mutants Δ403, L409A, and E412A completely lost activation activity in the presence of AT-RA, that wild-type RARα was able to activate transcription in a hormone dose-dependent fashion, and that P408L and M413A activated transcription to a lesser degree. These data indicated that the conserved residues of RARα helix 12 play a pivotal role in co-regulator recruitment and subsequent transcription regulation. Roles of RARα Helix 12 in Transcriptional Repression by RXRα/RARα—Because RXR/RAR heterodimers are the functional unit for AT-RA signaling and because they bind the DR5 element, the effects of these RARα mutations on transcription was further tested using a DR5-TK-Luc reporter construct (Fig. 3B). Without exogenous RARα, AT-RA activated reporter expression in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting the presence of endogenous RXRs and RARs in CV1 cells. Ectopic expression of wild-type RARα enhanced AT-RA-induced activation. Introduction of mutants Δ403 or Leu-409, moderately potentiated repression activity, consistent with their higher SMRT binding activity. Furthermore, at 10-100 nm AT-RA, all helix 12 mutants displayed reduced AT-RA-induced activation activity relative to transfected wild-type RARα. In particular, expression of RARα Δ403 abolished basal activity (lanes 9-12), indicating a dominant-negative effect. These data provide evidence that helix 12 of RARα plays a critical role in AT-RA-induced activation by RXRα/RARα heterodimers. Association of RXR Helix 12 Mutants with Co-regulators—Having determined the effects of mutations of RARα helix 12 on co-regulator binding and transcriptional activity, we next examined the properties of RXRα helix 12 mutants. We first determined whether RXRα helix 12 is critical for co-regulator recruitment in yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays. Because RXRs are capable of dimerizing with a set of nuclear receptors in mammalian cells and because yeast does not express nuclear receptors, Y2H assays provide a system to examine co-regulator association that excludes possible bridging effects by other receptors. Y2H expression vectors, pACTII-RXRα (LBD) and pGBT9 (Gal4 DBD)-SMRT (RID) or pGBT9-ACTR (RID), were co-transformed into yeast. The ability of these mutants to interact with co-regulators was measured in the absence or presence of hormone. In the absence of RXR agonists, β-galactosidase was expressed in cells co-transformed with pGBT9-SMRT (RID) and pACTII-RXRα (LBD) (Fig. 4A), whereas little β-galactosidase activity was detected in experiments with only one of the proteins. Although addition of LG268 did not have an effect on the interaction, 9-cis-RA moderately induced interaction between RXRα and SMRT. These data suggest that, in contrast to RAR ligands, which induce dissociation of co-repressors from RAR, RXR ligands do not disrupt RXRα-co-repressor association. Mutations at the conserved residues within RXRα helix 12 displayed varying effects on SMRT binding (Fig. 4B). Although mutants F450A and M454A/L455A completely abolished association with SMRT, mutant L451A increased SMRT binding activity, and this interaction was partially inhibited in the presence of 9-cis-RA or LG268. Deletion of helix 12 (Δ443) strongly enhanced hormone-independent co-repressor interaction, whereas 9-cis-RA or LG268 reduced the interaction by 50%. Our results suggest that helix 12 plays an important role in co-repressor recruitment by RXRα. Similar assays were also carried out to examine association between ACTR and wild-type or mutant RXRα. Expression of pGBT9-ACTR or pACTII-RXRα alone did not activate β-galactosidase expression with or without ligands (data not shown). In the absence of 9-cis-RA or LG268, a high level of β-galactosidase activity was measured in cells expressing pGBT9-ACTR and pACTII-RXRα, indicating that unliganded RXRα interacts with ACTR (Fig. 4C) in yeast. Moreover, 9-cis-RA and LG268 induced β-galactosidase expression an additional 3- to 4-fold, suggesting that both 9-cis-RA and LG268 were capable of promoting further association between RXRα and ACTR. Mutations or deletion of helix 12 completely abolished ligand-independent and ligand-induced RXRα-ACTR interactions. These results indicate that helix 12 is essential for both hormone-independent and -dependent recruitment of co-activators by RXRα in yeast. The effect of helix 12 mutations on transcriptional regulation of RXRα was examined by transient transfection assays as described in Fig. 3A. Reporter activity was measured in the absence or presence of an RXR-specific agonist, LG268. Fig. 4D shows that, in the absence of ligand, Gal4-RXRα weakly activated transcription. Mutations at the conserved residues had little effect on unliganded RXRα activity, except Δ443 and L451A, which possessed moderate repression activity, consistent with their strong association with SMRT in yeast. In the presence of LG268, Gal4-RXRα was able to activate transcription, but mutation or deletion of helix 12 dramatically reduced this activation. These data are consistent with the protein-protein interaction data from Y2H assays and suggest that helix 12 is critical for hormone-mediated transcriptional activation by Gal4-RXRα. RXRα Helix 12 Is Required for AT-RA-mediated Activation by RXRα/RARα—The primary sequence of RXRα helix 12 is similar to that of other class II receptors, yet the role of RXRα helix 12 in transcriptional regulation by class II nuclear receptors is unclear. AT-RA is an RARα-specific ligand and is thought to be permissive in AT-RA-mediated transactivation by RXRα/RARα heterodimers. In contrast, RXR-specific ligands such as LG268 do not activate transcription by RXRα/RARα and therefore RXRα is a non-permissive partner (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2843) Google Scholar, 5Leblanc B.P. Stunnenberg H.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1811-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). These observations argue that RXRα plays a minor role in AT-RA-mediated transcriptional activation. To examine the role of RXRα helix 12 in transcriptional regulation by RXRα/RARα, RXRα helix 12 mutants were used to test the transcription activity of RXRα/RARα on a βRARE-derived (DR5) reporter construct with or without hormone. Fig. 5A shows that AT-RA increased reporter activity in the absence of transfected RXRα (∼9-fold). Ectopic expression of wild-type RXRα stimulated AT-RA-induced activation by an additional 10-fold. Mutations in RXRα helix 12 reduced the AT-RA-induced activation observed with RXRα/RARα by 50-70%. In particular, exogenous expression of RXRα Δ443 completely abolished AT-RA-induced activation above the endogenous background. These data indicate that helix 12 of RXRα is essential for optimal AT-RA-induced transcriptional activation by RXRα/RARα heterodimers. The decreased reporter activity noted in Fig. 5A with the helix 12 mutants could be due to the inability of mutant RXRα/RARα heterodimers to recruit co-activators or the inability of RXRα/RARα to dissociate from co-repressors. To address this issue, we examined the association profiles of RXRα/RARα with co-repressors or co-activators by EMSAs. We first tested dissociation of SMRT from wild-type or mutant RXRα/RARα heterodimers with increasing concentrations of AT-RA (Fig. 5B). We found that mutant heterodimers with L451A (lane 9) or M454A/L455A (lane 13) display a slightly higher SMRT binding activity than that of wild-type RXRα/RARα. Furthermore, AT-RA-induced dissociation of SMRT was partially impaired in these mutants (lane 14). The ability of mutant heterodimers to recruit ACTR was also examined in the presence or absence of hormone (Fig. 5C). We found that the AT-RA-induced ACTR association with RXRα/RARα was slightly affected by the RXRα helix 12 point mutations. Deletion of RXR Helix 12 Reveals a Novel Role in Recruitment of Co-regulators by RXRα/RARα—We further examined whether deletion of RXRα helix 12 had effects on co-regulator recruitment by RXRα/RARα heterodimers. Fig. 6A shows an EMSA in which, as expected, wild-type RARα/RXRα heterodimers recruit ACTR (lanes 2-4) and dissociate from SMRT (lanes 6-8) in an AT-RA dose-dependent manner. To our surprise, heterodimeric RXRα Δ443/RARα acquired a hormone-independent co-activator binding activity (lanes 1 and 9), and this binding could be further induced by AT-RA (lanes 10-12). Moreover, RXRα Δ443/RARα had better SMRT binding activity than that of wild-type RXRα/RARα (lanes 13-16), and SMRT dissociation was less sensitive to AT-RA than that of wild-type RXRα/RARα (lanes 5-8). Because co-repressor release is a pre-requisite for co-activator binding and subsequent transcriptional activation (17Kao H.Y. Han C.C. Korma A.A. Evans R.M. J. Biol.

This regulation would result in a comprehensive EPA human study review process and review board specifically designed for such studies. The process would differ from that set out in the Rule, which details acceptable ethical standards for the protection of human subjects in research conducted or sponsored by all federal agencies. The
