https://openalex.org/W1975460230,"The three-dimensional structure of the proteasome from the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum has been elucidated by x-ray crystallographic analysis by means of isomorphous replacement and cyclic averaging. The atomic model was built and refined to a crystallographic R factor of 22.1 percent. The 673-kilodalton protease complex consists of 14 copies of two different subunits, alpha and beta, forming a barrel-shaped structure of four stacked rings. The two inner rings consist of seven beta subunits each, and the two outer rings consist of seven alpha subunits each. A narrow channel controls access to the three inner compartments. The alpha 7 beta 7 beta 7 alpha 7 subunit assembly has 72-point group symmetry. The structures of the alpha and beta subunits are similar, consisting of a core of two antiparallel beta sheets that is flanked by alpha helices on both sides. The binding of a peptide aldehyde inhibitor marks the active site in the central cavity at the amino termini of the beta subunits and suggests a novel proteolytic mechanism."

This is a special case of a more general method that can solve NP-complete problems. The advantage of these results is the huge parallelism inherent in DNA-based computing. It has the potential to yield vast speedups over conventional electronic-based computers for such search problems."
https://openalex.org/W1634459475,"Our previous studies in human monocytes have demonstrated that interleukin (IL)-10 inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated production of inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α by blocking gene transcription. Using electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we now show that, in monocytes stimulated with LPS or TNFα, IL-10 inhibits nuclear localization of nuclear factor κB (NFκB), a transcription factor involved in the expression of inflammatory cytokine genes. Several other transcription factors including NF-IL-6, AP-1, AP-2, GR, CREB, Oct-1, and Sp-1 are not affected by IL-10. This selective inhibition by IL-10 of NFκB activation occurs rapidly and in a dose-dependent manner and correlates well with IL-10's cytokine synthesis inhibitory activity in terms of both kinetics and dose responsiveness. Furthermore, compounds such as tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone and pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate that are known to selectively inhibit NFκB activation block cytokine gene transcription in LPS-stimulated monocytes. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of NFκB activation may be an important mechanism for IL-10 supression of cytokine gene transcription in human monocytes. IL-4, another cytokine that inhibits cytokine mRNA accumulation in monocytes, shows little inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NFκB activation. Further examination reveals that, unlike IL-10, IL-4 enhances mRNA degradation and does not suppress cytokine gene transcription. These data indicate that IL-10 and IL-4 inhibit cytokine production by different mechanisms.

https://openalex.org/W2167182434,"Filamentous aggregates of the 40-42-residue amyloid β-protein (Aβ) accumulate progressively in the limbic and cerebral cortex in Alzheimer's disease, where they are intimately associated with neuronal and glial cytopathology. Attempts to model this cytotoxicity in vitro using synthetic peptides have shown that monomeric Aβ is relatively inert, whereas aggregated Aβ reproducibly exerts a variety of neurotoxic effects. The processes that mediate the conversion of monomeric Aβ into a toxic aggregated state are thus of great interest. Previous studies of this conversion have employed high concentrations (10−5-10−3M) of synthetic Aβ peptides under nonbiological conditions. We report here the detection of small amounts (<10−9M) of SDS-stable Aβ oligomers in the culture media of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing endogenous or transfected amyloid β-protein precursor genes. The identity of these oligomers (primarily dimers and trimers) was established by immunoprecipitation with a panel of Aβ antibodies, by electrophoretic comigration with synthetic Aβ oligomers, and by amino acid sequencing. The oligomeric Aβ species comprised ∼10-20% of the total immunoprecipitable Aβ in these cultures. A truncated Aβ species beginning at Arg 5 was enriched in the oligomers, suggesting that amino-terminal heterogeneity can influence Aβ oligomerization in this system. Addition of Congo red (10 μM) during metabolic labeling of the cells led to increased monomeric and decreased oligomeric Aβ. The ability to detect and quantitate oligomers of secreted Aβ peptides in cell culture should facilitate dynamic studies of the critical process of initial Aβ aggregation under physiological conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2017169241,"The effects of neurotrophins on several forms of neuronal degeneration in murine cortical cell cultures were examined. Consistent with other studies, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin-3, and neurotrophin-4/5 all attenuated the apoptotic death induced by serum deprivation or exposure to the calcium channel antagonist nimodipine. Unexpectedly, however, 24-hour pretreatment with these same neurotrophins markedly potentiated the necrotic death induced by exposure to oxygen-glucose deprivation or N-methyl-D-aspartate. Thus, certain neurotrophins may have opposing effects on different types of death in the same neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2010155234,Parasite-specific CD4+ T cells have been shown to transfer protection against Leishmania major in susceptible BALB/c mice. An epitope-tagged expression library was used to identify the antigen recognized by a protective CD4+ T cell clone. The expression library allowed recombinant proteins made in bacteria to be captured by macrophages for presentation to T cells restricted to major histocompatibility complex class II. A conserved 36-kilodalton member of the tryptophan-aspartic acid repeat family of proteins was identified that was expressed in both stages of the parasite life cycle. A 24-kilodalton portion of this antigen protected susceptible mice when administered as a vaccine with interleukin-12 before infection.

https://openalex.org/W2156675999,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) is a transcriptional activator that is essential for EBV-driven B cell immortalization. EBNA2 is targeted to responsive promoters through interaction with a cellular DNA binding protein, C promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1). A transcriptional repression domain has been identified within CBF1. This domain also interacts with EBNA2, and repression is masked by EBNA2 binding. Thus, EBNA2 acts by countering transcriptional repression. Mutation at amino acid 233 of CBF1 abolishes repression and correlates with a loss-of-function mutation in the Drosophila homolog Su(H)."

Both double strand (Sp1) and single strand (hnRNP K) CT-binding proteins have been implicated as mediators of CT action. Although significant levels of CT activity persisted following Sp1 immunodepletion, EGTA totally abolished transactivation, thus implicating another metal requiring factor in CT element activity. As hnRNP K binds to one strand of the CT element, but has no metal requirement, the opposite (purine-rich strand) was examined as a target for a metal-dependent protein. A zinc-requiring purine strand binding activity was identified as cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP), a protein previously implicated in the regulation of sterol responsive genes. Two forms of CNBP differed in their relative binding to the CT- or sterol-response elements. CNBP was shown to be a bona fide regulator of the CT element by cotransfection of a CNBP expression vector that stimulated expression of a CT-driven but not an AP1-dependent reporter.

https://openalex.org/W2056273668,"KAPOSI'S sarcoma (KS) occurs more often in men than in women and HIV-l-associated KS has a high occurrence in homosexual men (over 30%). Most cultures of KS tumours yield cells with properties of hyperplastic (not malignant) endothelial cells under the control of several cytokines1á€-7. The role of HIV-1 may be in promoting high levels of some cytokines and providing stimulation to angiogenesis by the HIV-1 Tat protein8, which synergizes with basic fibroblast growth factor in promoting these effects9. Here we describe an immortalized AIDS-KS cell line (KS Y-l) and show that these cells produce malignant metastatic tumours in nude mice and are killed in vitro and in vivo (apparently by apoptosis) by a pregnancy hormone, the β-chain of human chorionic gonadotropin. Similarly, chorionic gonadotropin kills KS SLK, cells from another neoplastic cell line (established from a non-HIV-associated KS)10, as well as the hyper plastic KS cells from clinical specimens grown in short-term culture, but does not kill normal endothelial cells. These results provide evidence that KS can evolve into a malignancy and have implications for the hormonal treatment of this tumour."
https://openalex.org/W2010401605,"We have previously reported that the transcriptional activation function AF-1, located in the A/B region of the human estrogen receptor, exhibits cell-type and promoter context specificity in both animal cells and yeast. To further characterize AF-1, we have constructed a number of deletion mutants spanning the A/B region in the context of either the whole human estrogen receptor or the A/B region linked to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, and tested their transcriptional activity in chicken embryo fibroblasts and in yeast cells, two cell types in which AF-1 efficiently activates transcription on its own. Additionally, we utilized HeLa cells in which AF-1 is poorly active but can synergize with the transcriptional activation function AF-2 located in the hormone binding domain. We show that in animal cells the “independent” activity of AF-1 is embodied in a rather hydrophobic proline-rich 99-amino acid activating domain (amino acids 51-149), whereas amino acids 51-93 and 102-149 can independently synergize with AF-2. Interestingly, in yeast, three discrete activating domains (amino acids 1-62, 80-113, and 118-149) are almost as active on their own as the whole A/B region, indicating that multiple activating domains can operate independently in yeast. Our study also demonstrates that, within the context of the whole human estrogen receptor, the same AF-1 activating domains are “induced” by either estradiol or 4-hydroxytamoxifen.

In the current investigation we identify the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein/α2-macroglobulin receptor (LRP) as a receptor responsible for mediating the internalization of TSP leading to its degradation. LRP is a large cell surface receptor consisting of a 515-kDa heavy chain and an 85-kDa light chain proteolytically derived from a 600-kDa precursor. A specific and high affinity interaction between purified LRP and TSP was demonstrated by homologous ligand competition experiments, where a KD of 3-20 n M was measured using different preparations of TSP. The binding of TSP to purified LRP was completely inhibited by the 39-kDa receptor-associated protein, a known antagonist of ligand binding by LRP. Cultured fibroblasts rapidly internalize and degrade 125I-labeled TSP via a receptor-mediated process. This process is inhibited by receptor-associated protein and by antibodies against LRP, indicating that LRP is mediating the cellular internalization of TSP. Our studies also confirm that the efficient catabolism of TSP requires the participation of cell surface proteoglycans, since digestion of cells with heparitinase markedly reduces the extent of LRP-mediated TSP degradation.

Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Google Scholar, 28Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Google Scholar). TSP supports attachment of several cultured cells, including human endothelial cells, and human smooth muscle cells via a RGD and calcium dependent mechanism (29Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Google Scholar). TSP is also found in the α-granules of platelets (30Baenziger N.L. Brodie G.N. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 2723-2731Google Scholar), and is secreted when platelets are activated with thrombin. After release from the platelets, TSP binds to the platelet surface, where it may be involved in mediating interactions with other platelets, or the endothelial substratum (31Sage E.H. Bornstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14831-14834Google Scholar). TSP is synthesized by endothelial cells (32Mosher D.F. Doyle M.J. Jaffe E.A. J.

Hanning R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 22-28Google Scholar). Since this process can be blocked by excess unlabeled TSP, an interaction with a cell-surface receptor was suspected (35McKeown-Longo P.J. Hanning R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 22-28Google Scholar). In the present paper we have identified this receptor as LRP. Our results demonstrate a high affinity interaction between LRP and TSP, and confirm that LRP mediates the internalization and subsequent degradation of TSP in cultured fibroblasts. Thrombin was purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, Inc. (South Bend, IN). Thrombospondin was purified from thrombin-activated platelets essentially as described (36Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Google Scholar). Platelet concentrates were obtained from the American Red Cross Blood Services and were washed and activated with thrombin as described (36Lawler J. Chao F.C. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12257-12265Google Scholar). After 2 min, thrombin activity was inhibited with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or with D-Phe-Pro-Arg-CH2Cl (PPACK). The platelets were pelleted, and the supernatant was concentrated, and applied to a Sephacryl S-200 column (3 × 50 cm) equilibrated with 10 m M Tris, 148 m M NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS). TSP from the gel filtration column was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (1.2 × 5 cm) equilibrated in TBS containing 5 m M EDTA. Following washing, TSP was eluted with 10 m M Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.55 M NaCl. Peak fractions were pooled, dialyzed against TBS, and stored at −70°C. The concentration of TSP was determined using an E280 nm1% of 10.9 (37Margossian S.S. Lawler J.W. Slayter H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 256: 7495-7500Google Scholar). Thrombospondin was labeled with [125I]Iodine using IODO-GEN (Pierce) following a protocol previously described (12Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Google Scholar). The specific activity of the iodinated protein was between 0.2 and 0.6 μCi/μg. LRP was purified from human placenta as described (13Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Google Scholar), while RAP was produced using a previously described expression system (21Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). Bovine serum albumin and heparin were purchased from Sigma. LRP-Sepharose was prepared by coupling human LRP to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Pharmacia) at 1 mg/ml resin. Supernatant from thrombin-stimulated platelets obtained from 5 units of platelets (30 ml) was applied first to CL-4B Sepharose, then applied to an LRP-Sepharose column (2 ml) and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The column was washed with 50 column volumes of 50 m M Tris, 150 m M NaCl, pH 8.0, then eluted with 2 column volumes of 8 M urea, 50 m M Tris, pH 7.4. Eluted fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE in the absence of reducing agents on 4-12% polyacrylamide gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Protein sequencing analysis was performed on the affinity selected protein by first eluting the protein bands from SDS-PAGE then sequencing the amino-terminal using a Hewlett-Packard (model G1000S) protein sequenator. Mouse monoclonal anti-human TSP A6.1 (38Dixit V.M. Galvin N.J. O'Rourke K.M. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1962-1968Google Scholar) was utilized for ligand blotting studies. Antibodies to human LRP (R777) were prepared as described (20Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. Fitzgerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar) and were affinity-selected from rabbit polyclonal antisera using an LRP-Sepharose column. Antibodies to the cytoplasmic domain of LRP were prepared against a synthetic peptide and their preparation and characterization have been previously described (20Kounnas M.Z. Morris R.E. Thompson M.R. Fitzgerald D.J. Strickland D.K. Saelinger C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12420-12423Google Scholar). Heterologous and homologous ligand competition assays were performed as described by Williams et al. (21Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). The computer program LIGAND (39Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Google Scholar) was used to analyze the data. Ligand blotting experiments were carried out as described previously (12Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Briefly, 3 μg of LRP was subjected to SDS-PAGE on 4-12% gradient gels (Novex) under nonreducing conditions, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 3% non-fat milk, and incubated with 50 n M thrombospondin for 3 h at room temperature in TBS containing 3% non-fat milk, 5 m M CaCl2, and 0.05% Tween 20. In some experiments, 400 n M RAP was included. In those experiments examining the effect of EDTA on the binding of TSP to immobilized LRP, the non-fat milk was dialyzed overnight against TBS containing 10 m M EDTA prior to the assay. After three washes, the filters were incubated with a anti-TSP monoclonal antibody (1.0 μg/ml) for 1 h at 25°C, and then incubated with a goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 1 h at 25°C. TSP binding was visualized using the Renaissance Chemiluminescence kit (DuPont NEN, Boston, MA). WI-38 human lung fibroblasts (ATCC CCL75, American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were seeded into 12-well culture dishes 2-3 days prior to assay and were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech, Washington, D.C.) supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum (Hyclone, Logan UT) and penicillin/streptomycin. All experiments were performed using confluent cell layers. Surface binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-TSP (generally 10 n M, 50-150 cpm/fmol) by cells was measured after incubation for indicated time intervals at 37°C in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified medium containing 0.3 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Surface binding and internalization is defined as radioactivity that is sensitive or resistant, respectively, to release from cells by trypsin (0.5 mg/ml) and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma) in buffer containing 5 m M EDTA. Degradation is defined as radioactivity in the medium that is soluble in 10% trichloroacetic acid. In all experiments a control was included in which the amount of degradation products generated in the absence of cells was also measured. Cells were incubated with medium containing heparitinase (Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) at a concentration of 0.001 IU/ml for 45 min at 37°C followed by two rapid washes prior to internalization assays. In control experiments, heparan sulfate (0.9 mg/ml) (Sigma) was pre-mixed with the heparitinase to saturate the enzyme and protect cell-surface proteoglycans from cleavage. Previous studies (35McKeown-Longo P.J. Hanning R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 22-28Google Scholar) have suggested that cultured fibroblasts contain a specific cell-surface receptor that mediates the internalization of TSP, leading to its degradation. Since LRP binds numerous ligands, and is expressed in fibroblasts, affinity chromatography experiments were initiated to characterize the potential interaction between TSP and LRP. TSP is a component of the platelet α-granule, and is released when platelets are activated with thrombin. In the present experiments, the supernatant from thrombin-stimulated platelets was applied to LRP-Sepharose. After extensive washing, the column was eluted in a buffer containing 8 M urea. Selected fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 1). A major polypeptide, with an approximate molecular mass of 400 kDa, was eluted from the affinity resin. Upon reduction, a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa was noted (data not shown). Amino-terminal sequencing of the band excised from the gel yielded the sequence of Asn-Arg-Ile-Pro-Glu-Ser-Gly-Gly-Asp-Asn, which corresponds to the amino-terminal sequence of human TSP (26Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 103: 1635-1648Google Scholar). The polypeptide eluted from the LRP-Sepharose column also reacted with a monoclonal antibody against TSP upon immunoblotting following transfer to nitrocellulose (data not shown). These data confirm that TSP binds to immobilized LRP-Sepharose. To further characterize the interaction between TSP and LRP, ligand blotting experiments were employed. The results (Fig. 2) demonstrate that TSP, like other LRP ligands, binds to the heavy chain of LRP. The amount of TSP bound was significantly reduced by including RAP during the incubation. RAP is known to prevent the binding of ligands to LRP (21Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar, 25Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding was reduced when EDTA was added to the incubation mixture, suggesting a requirement for divalent cations for the interaction. While TSP itself binds calcium (40Lawler J. Simons E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 258: 12098-12101Google Scholar), the requirement of metal ions for the binding of this protein to immobilized LRP is in agreement with the known requirement of metal ions for the binding of most ligands to LRP (13Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Google Scholar, 41Moestrup S.K. Kaltoft K. Sottrup-Jensen L. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12623-12628Google Scholar). To derive quantitative data regarding the interaction between TSP and LRP, homologous-ligand competition assays were performed. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that 125I-TSP binds to microtiter wells coated with purified LRP, but not microtiter wells coated with bovine serum albumin. The binding is prevented by excess cold TSP, which is consistent with specific binding. The data are adequately described by a model containing a single class of sites with a KD of 9 n M. In separate experiments, utilizing different preparations of TSP, the KD varied between 3 and 20 n M. Fig. 3 B demonstrates that RAP inhibits the binding of 125I-TSP to microtiter wells coated with LRP with a KI of 0.5 n M, a value that is in excellent agreement with the known affinity of LRP for RAP (21Williams S.E. Ashcom J.D. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9035-9040Google Scholar). Together, these results indicate a high affinity and specific binding of 125I-TSP to LRP, and document that RAP prevents this interaction. Since our experiments have documented a high affinity and specific interaction between TSP and LRP, it was of interest to determine whether or not LRP is capable of mediating the cellular internalization of 125I-labeled TSP. The role of LRP in TSP uptake and degradation was investigated using RAP and affinity purified antibodies against LRP which are known to block ligand internalization (12Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Google Scholar, 18Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Google Scholar, 42Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Iverius P.-H. Williams S.E. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25764-25767Google Scholar). Fig. 4 demonstrates the time course of surface binding, internalization, and degradation of 125I-TSP by cultured fibroblasts at 37°C, and the effect of RAP on this process. When added to cultured fibroblasts at 37°C, 125I-TSP demonstrated a slow, time-dependent binding to cells that was not blocked by RAP (top panel, Fig. 4). This binding was also not competed by addition of excess unlabeled TSP (data not shown). In contrast, RAP inhibits the internalization (middle panel, Fig. 4) and the degradation (bottom panel, Fig. 4) of 125I-TSP. Similar results were obtained in two additional experiments, each utilizing different TSP preparations. The effect of RAP concentration on the internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled TSP is shown in Fig. 5. The data reveal that relatively low concentrations of RAP are effective in inhibiting the internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled TSP, and that RAP is more effective than unlabeled TSP in blocking internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled TSP. These results confirm that a RAP-sensitive receptor, most likely LRP, mediates the cellular uptake and degradation of 125I-TSP in cultured fibroblasts.Figure 5:RAP inhibits the internalization and degradation of 125I-TSP in cultured human lung fibroblasts. Wells containing 1 X 105 cells (human WI-38 fibroblasts) were incubated with 125I-TSP (10 nM) for 5 h at 37°C in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled TSP or RAP. Following incubation, the extent of internalization (A) and degradation (B) of 125I-labeled TSP was measured as described in the legend to Fig. 4. •, TSP; ◼, RAP. Each data point represents the mean of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Since RAP is known to interact with the VLDL receptor and gp330, confirmation for the role of LRP in the internalization and degradation of TSP was obtained by the use of specific LRP antibodies which are known to block the uptake and degradation of ligands. Fig. 6 demonstrates that an affinity purified anti-LRP IgG is effective in preventing the internalization and degradation of 125I-TSP by cultured fibroblasts. As a control, an antibody against the cytoplasmic domain of LRP was utilized, and was unable to inhibit either the internalization or the degradation of 125I-TSP (Fig. 6). These experiments confirm that LRP is responsible for mediating the internalization of 125I-TSP leading to its degradation. Our data demonstrate that LRP is responsible for mediating the cellular internalization of TSP by WI-38 fibroblasts. However, it is also apparent that TSP binds to molecules other than LRP on the cell surface. Previous studies have reported a reduction in the binding and degradation of TSP by Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in glycosaminoglycan synthesis (43Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6400-6406Google Scholar). In order to determine if cell-surface proteoglycans facilitate TSP catabolism in cultured fibroblasts, cells were first treated with heparitinase, and then the ability of control and treated cells to bind 125I-labeled TSP at 4°C measured. The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 7 A, and demonstrate that both heparin and heparitinase treatment of fibroblasts reduces the amount of 125I-TSP bound to the cells at 4°C. In a control experiment, heparan sulfate was added separately and along with heparitinase. Heparan sulfate, a substrate for the enzyme, by itself had no effect on 125I-TSP binding to cells. However, exogenous heparan sulfate did minimize the effect of heparitinase treatment on 125I-TSP binding. This control experiment suggests that the decrease in 125I-TSP binding after heparitinase treatment of cells is very likely the result of removal of cell-surface proteoglycans. Fig. 7B shows that heparitinase treatment of cultured fibroblasts significantly reduces the LRP-mediated degradation of 125I-TSP at 37°C. Heparitinase treatment of cultured fibroblasts had a similar effect on the uptake of TSP by fibroblasts (data not shown). These results confirm that cell-surface proteoglycans play an important role in TSP catabolism and appear to be required for the LRP-mediated internalization and degradation of TSP in cultured fibroblasts. The previous experiments document the importance of cell-surface proteoglycans in the LRP-mediated degradation of TSP. In addition to its interaction with proteoglycans, TSP is known to bind to a number of different cell-surface molecules (for review, see Ref. 44Lahav J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1182: 1-14Google Scholar). It was of interest therefore to determine the fate of 125I-TSP bound to the cell surface, and to investigate the fraction of cell-surface bound protein that is actually internalized and degraded. To measure this, 125I-TSP was incubated with cultured fibroblasts at 4°C in the absence and presence of RAP. After removal of unbound ligand by washing, the temperature was raised to 37°C to initiate endocytosis, and the cells incubated in the presence or absence of RAP. At selected time intervals, the fate of the surface bound 125I-TSP was followed. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 8. In the absence of RAP, approximately 80% of the 125I-TSP disappeared from the surface of the cell with time (top panel, Fig. 8). A portion of the 125I-TSP simply dissociates from the cell surface and is released into the culture medium (data not shown). However, approximately 35-40% of the labeled material is internalized (middle panel, Fig. 8) and eventually degraded (bottom panel, Fig. 8). In the presence of RAP, significantly less material was internalized (Fig. 8, middle panel), confirming the role of LRP in this process. RAP also reduced the amount of 125I-TSP that was degraded (bottom panel, Fig. 8). The results of these experiments confirm that a substantial portion of the 125I-TSP bound on the cell surface is rapidly internalized and degraded at 37°C in a process mediated by LRP. TSP is a cell and matrix glycoprotein that interacts with a variety of molecules. These include structural and matrix proteins such as collagen (45Mumby S.M. Raugi G.J. Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 646Google Scholar) and fibronectin (46Lahav J. Schwartz M.A. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1982; 31: 253-262Google Scholar), and polyanionic molecules such as heparin (47Dixit V.M. Grant G.A. Santoro S.A. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10100-10105Google Scholar). In addition, TSP is an inhibitor of plasmin (48Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 265-269Google Scholar) and neutrophil elastase (49Hogg P.J. Owensby D.A. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Chesterman C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7139-7146Google Scholar) activity. Unlike some matrix adhesive proteins, such as fibronectin, TSP is rapidly catabolized by fibroblasts (35McKeown-Longo P.J. Hanning R. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 22-28Google Scholar), Chinese hamster ovary cells (43Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6400-6406Google Scholar), and endothelial cells (50Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1603-1611Google Scholar) in a process mediated by a specific cell-surface receptor(s). In the current investigation we have identified LRP as a receptor responsible for the internalization and degradation of TSP. A specific and high affinity interaction between purified LRP and TSP was demonstrated by affinity chromatography, ligand blotting experiments, and homologous competition experiments. The interaction of LRP with TSP has properties that are characteristic of LRP's interaction with many other ligands. These include high affinity and specific binding to the LRP heavy chain, a requirement of divalent cations for binding, and antagonism of binding by RAP. Our experiments also document that LRP mediates the cellular uptake of 125I-labeled TSP in cultured fibroblasts leading to its degradation. This has been confirmed by demonstrating that RAP and anti-LRP antibodies prevented the degradation of 125I-labeled TSP by these cells. It should be pointed out that RAP is an effective inhibitor of ligand binding to LRP, gp330, and the VLDL receptor, and thus RAP is not a specific antagonist for LRP. Our data indicate that in lung fibroblasts, LRP is the major receptor responsible for TSP catabolism, since anti-LRP antibodies are as effective as RAP in blocking degradation of 125I-TSP. An important feature of TSP catabolism is that cell-surface proteoglycans facilitate this process. This was first demonstrated when mutant Chinese hamster ovary cells, defective in glycosaminoglycan synthesis, were found unable to internalize and degrade TSP (43Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Westrick L.G. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6400-6406Google Scholar). The present studies confirm the importance of cell-surface proteoglycans in the catabolism of TSP by demonstrating that treatment of cells with heparitinase markedly reduces the extent of LRP-mediated TSP uptake and degradation. In agreement with these observations is the fact that TSP catabolism is also sensitive to heparin. The participation of cell-surface proteoglycans in TSP catabolism resembles their role in promoting the LRP-mediated catabolism of lipoprotein lipase (18Chappell D.A. Fry G.L. Waknitz M.A. Muhonen L.E. Pladet M.W. Iverius P.-H. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14168-14175Google Scholar), and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (51Warshawsky I. Broze G.J.J. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6664-6668Google Scholar). While the exact role that cell-surface proteoglycans play in the catabolism of these ligands is not clear, they may function to concentrate the ligands on the cell surface and facilitate their internalization and degradation by presenting them to LRP. This is somewhat analogous to the role proteoglycans play in presenting basic fibroblast growth factor to its receptor (52Yayon A. Klagsbrun M. Esko J.D. Leder P. Ornitz D.M. Cell. 1991; 64: 841-848Google Scholar). A similar transfer mechanism has been described for the LRP-mediated internalization of uPA-plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 complexes (53Nykj A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Google Scholar), which initially bind to the urokinase receptor, and are then transferred to LRP for internalization. Results from the present investigation suggest that LRP is the major receptor responsible for mediating the internalization and degradation of 125I-TSP in fibroblasts. This is based on the observation that anti-LRP antibodies are able to completely inhibit the degradation of 125I-TSP in these cells. Furthermore, it appears that cell lines that lack LRP are greatly reduced in their capacity to internalize and degrade TSP. For example, our own studies2 2F. Battey, I. Mikhailenko, and D. Strickland, unpublished observation. found that cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells are unable to internalize or degrade significant amounts of 125I-labeled TSP. When detergent extracts of human umbilical vein or human aorta endothelial cells were analyzed by immunoblotting, no LRP antigen was detected. Cellular uptake experiments revealed that 125I-labeled α2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes are not internalized by these cells. These studies confirm that human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human aortic endothelial cells lack detectable LRP. Very likely, this accounts for their greatly reduced capacity to internalize and degrade TSP. While our studies suggest that LRP is the major receptor responsible for the cellular internalization of TSP, it is certainly possible that other cell-surface molecules may also mediate the internalization and degradation of TSP. In contrast to our studies with human umbilical endothelial cells, Murphy-Ullrich and Mosher (50Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1603-1611Google Scholar) reported that normal and variant bovine aorta endothelial cells were capable of internalizing and degrading 125I-labeled TSP. What is not known at present is whether or not these cell lines express LRP. If so, then this would explain their ability to internalize and degrade TSP. Alternatively, if they do not contain LRP, then it is likely that another receptor, perhaps another LDL receptor family member, is also able to mediate the cellular internalization of TSP. The ability of LRP to directly bind and mediate the catabolism of TSP indicates that this receptor may play an important role in regulating TSP levels in plasma. In addition, since LRP is expressed in smooth muscle cells, LRP likely also regulates TSP levels in the vessel wall. The significance of the degradative pathway for TSP is not fully apparent at present. However, TSP appears to have a diverse role in regulating cellular proliferation, adhesion, and migration. The TSP gene is an inducible immediate-early response gene to platelet-derived growth factor in smooth muscle cells (54Majack R.A. Mildbrandt J. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8821-8825Google Scholar), and monoclonal antibodies against TSP can inhibit smooth muscle cell growth (55Majack R.A. Goodman L.V. Dixit V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 415-422Google Scholar). Furthermore, TSP has been shown to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis (56Good D.J. Polverini P.J. Rastinejad F. Le Beau M.M. Lemons R.S. Frazier W.A. Bouck N.P. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6624-6628Google Scholar). During murine development, TSP antigen is localized primarily in regions of cellular proliferation, migration, and intercellular adhesion (57O'Shea K.S. Dixit V.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2737-2748Google Scholar), suggesting some role for TSP in these processes. Finally, TSP has been suggested to directly activate transforming growth factor-β (58Schultz-Cherry S. Ribeiro S. Gentry L. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26775-26782Google Scholar), a potent growth regulatory protein normally secreted from cells in a latent form. All of these studies suggest that TSP may impact a variety of biological processes, and if so, it would be important to have a mechanism for rapid catabolism of TSP to regulate its level. TSP has also recently been identified as an inhibitor of plasmin (48Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 265-269Google Scholar), neutrophil elastase (49Hogg P.J. Owensby D.A. Mosher D.F. Misenheimer T.M. Chesterman C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7139-7146Google Scholar), and cathepsin G (59Hogg P.J. Owensby D.A. Chesterman C.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21811-21818Google Scholar). TSP may therefore act as a proteinase inhibitor, and minimize the effect of proteinases on matrix degradation. In this regard, it is interesting to highlight that LRP binds and mediates the internalization of several proteinases and proteinase-inhibitor complexes. These include uPA (12Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21862-21867Google Scholar), tPA (11Bu G. Williams S. Strickland D.K. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7427-7431Google Scholar), complexes of tPA (60Orth K. Madison E.L. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7422-7426Google Scholar) and uPA (53Nykj A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M. Andreasen P.A. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14543-14546Google Scholar) with plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, α2-macroglobulin-proteinase complexes (13Ashcom J.D. Tiller S.E. Dickerson K. Cravens J.L. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 1041-1048Google Scholar, 14Moestrup S.K. Gliemann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15574-15577Google Scholar), and complexes of uPA with protease nexin-1 (61Conese M. Olson D. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17886-17892Google Scholar). In summary, the present investigation has shown that TSP binds to and is internalized by LRP in cultured cells. The efficient catabolism of TSP requires the participation of cell-surface proteoglycans, which may function to concentrate TSP on the cell surface. The degradation of TSP is likely to be an important component of the mechanisms that control TSP levels.

https://openalex.org/W1546886821,"The cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit of the αIIbβ3integrin is required for cell spreading on fibrinogen. Here we report that deletion of six amino acids from the COOH terminus of the β3(I757TYRGT) totally abolished cell spreading and formation of adhesion plaques, whereas retaining Ile757partially preserved these functions. We further found that substitution of Tyr747 with Ala also abolished αIIbβ3-mediated cell spreading.The effects of these and other mutations on additional functions of αIIbβ3were also studied. Progressive truncations of β3, in which stop codons were inserted at amino acid positions 759-756, caused partial defects in the recruitment of αIIbβ3to preestablished adhesion plaques and a gradual decrease in the ability of αIIbβ3to mediate internalization of fibrinogen-coated particles. The Tyr747 → Ala substitution mutant was almost totally inactive in both of these assays. Point mutations at Tyr759, and at a conserved area close to the transmembrane domain of β3, decreased integrin recruitment to preestablished adhesion plaques but allowed αIIbβ3-mediated formation of these structures and partial cell spreading. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of β3did not affect the constitutive endocytosis of αIIbβ3. The cytoplasmic domain of the β subunit of the αIIbβ3integrin is required for cell spreading on fibrinogen. Here we report that deletion of six amino acids from the COOH terminus of the β3(I757TYRGT) totally abolished cell spreading and formation of adhesion plaques, whereas retaining Ile757partially preserved these functions. We further found that substitution of Tyr747 with Ala also abolished αIIbβ3-mediated cell spreading. The effects of these and other mutations on additional functions of αIIbβ3were also studied. Progressive truncations of β3, in which stop codons were inserted at amino acid positions 759-756, caused partial defects in the recruitment of αIIbβ3to preestablished adhesion plaques and a gradual decrease in the ability of αIIbβ3to mediate internalization of fibrinogen-coated particles. The Tyr747 → Ala substitution mutant was almost totally inactive in both of these assays. Point mutations at Tyr759, and at a conserved area close to the transmembrane domain of β3, decreased integrin recruitment to preestablished adhesion plaques but allowed αIIbβ3-mediated formation of these structures and partial cell spreading. Deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of β3did not affect the constitutive endocytosis of αIIbβ3."

Recombinant murine MK enhanced plasminogen activator (PA)/plasmin levels in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. After incubation with 10 ng/ml MK for 18 h, PA and plasmin levels increased 6- and 4-fold, respectively. This effect was attributed to a moderate up-regulation of urokinase-type PA expression as well as to a significant down-regulation of PA inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression. BAECs constitutively synthesized and secreted MK and its production was enhanced 2-fold with 1 μM retinoic acid or 10 μM retinol. It was found that MK served as a substrate for tissue transglutaminase. In the culture medium, MK existed as a transglutaminase-mediated complex of 36 kDa. Addition of anti-MK antibody to BAEC cultures resulted in a decrease of basal PA activity and an increase of basal PAI-l levels and attenuated the ability of retinol to enhance PA activity 50% and potentiated the ability to increase PAI-1 levels 4-fold. Furthermore, MK and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) acted more than additively in enhancing PA levels. We conclude that in BAECs MK is a novel autocrine factor sustaining the fibrinolytic property.

https://openalex.org/W2055919299,"Mimosine has been reported to specifically prevent initiation of DNA replication in the chromosomes of mammalian nuclei. To test this hypothesis, the effects of mimosine were examined in several DNA replication systems and compared with the effects of aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases. Our results demonstrated that mimosine inhibits DNA synthesis in mitochondrial, nuclear, and simian virus 40 (SV40) genomes to a similar extent. Furthermore, mimosine and aphidicolin were indistinguishable in their ability to arrest SV40 replication forks and mammalian nuclear chromosomal replication forks. In contrast to aphidicolin, mimosine did not inhibit DNA replication in lysates of mammalian cells supplied with exogenous deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate precursors for DNA synthesis. Mimosine also had no effect on initiation or elongation of DNA replication in Xenopus eggs or egg extracts containing high levels of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates. In parallel with its inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis in mammalian cells, mimosine altered deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate pools in a manner similar to that reported for another DNA replication inhibitor that affects deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, hydroxyurea. Taken together, these results show that mimosine inhibits DNA synthesis at the level of elongation of nascent chains by altering deoxyribonucleotide metabolism.

Taken together, these results show that mimosine inhibits DNA synthesis at the level of elongation of nascent chains by altering deoxyribonucleotide metabolism. Chemical agents that reversibly inhibit DNA synthesis have proven to be effective tools for investigating DNA replication in mammalian cells. Until recently, however, all of these agents were believed to target cellular processes involved in the elongation phase of DNA replication. In fact, the lack of agents that specifically inhibit initiation of DNA replication is in part responsible for the paucity of information that exists on the initiation process. A recent candidate for a specific inhibitor of initiation of DNA replication is the plant amino acid mimosine (β- N(3-hydroxy-4-pyridone)-α-amino propionic acid). Fluorescence activated cell sorter analyses of exponentially proliferating mammalian cells arrested with mimosine suggested that they accumulated in the late G1phase of their cell division cycle (1Carbonaro-Hall D. Williams R. Wu L. Warburton D. Zeichner-David M. MacDougall M. Tolo V. Hall F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1649-1659Google Scholar, 2Lalande M. Exp. Cell.

Cytometry. 1991; 12: 242-246Google Scholar). More detailed studies revealed that mimosine inhibited DNA replication throughout S phase but only after several hours of treatment (5Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Google Scholar, 6Levenson V. Hamlin J.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3997-4004Google Scholar, 7Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Google Scholar). Two observations in these studies supported the conclusion that mimosine specifically blocked initiation of new replicons. First, the length of time required for mimosine to inhibit DNA replication in cells that were synchronized at the beginning of S phase with aphidicolin was substantially longer than the time required to inhibit replication in exponentially proliferating cells. Since aphidicolin allows formation of replication bubbles but prevents subsequent expansion of these bubbles by inhibiting specifically DNA polymerases α, δ, and ∊ (8Wang T.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 513-552Google Scholar), mimosine appeared to inhibit replication only when new initiation events were required to sustain S phase, analogous to “slow stop” mutations in bacteria or yeast that specifically block initiation of DNA replication (9Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Second, replication fork structures were not detected by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis after prolonged treatment of cells with mimosine. This observation suggested that mimosine prevented formation of new replication forks, while allowing previously existing replication forks (present in replicons initiated prior to addition of mimosine) to complete replication. As a result of these studies, mimosine has recently been employed by a number of laboratories under the assumption that this drug synchronizes cells just prior to the onset of DNA replication (1Carbonaro-Hall D. Williams R. Wu L. Warburton D. Zeichner-David M. MacDougall M. Tolo V. Hall F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1649-1659Google Scholar, 3Marracino R.L. Fugo E.J. Roberts J.M. Mol. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 494-498Google Scholar). While mimosine may serve as a useful agent for synchronizing cells, accurate interpretation of experimental data depends on understanding the mechanism of mimosine action. The evidence that mimosine inhibits initiation of DNA replication is indirect, and alternative explanations exist for the effects described above. For example, mimosine could inhibit nucleotide metabolism, resulting in delayed arrest of DNA synthesis at replication forks followed by destabilization of replication fork structures. Therefore, it was important to determine whether or not mimosine was a specific inhibitor of initiation of DNA replication in cellular chromosomes or a general inhibitor of DNA synthesis at replication forks. To this end, we compared the effects of mimosine on nuclear, mitochondrial, and simian virus 40 (SV40) DNA replication, as well as on DNA replication in Xenopus eggs. The mechanisms by which DNA replication occurs in these four systems differ substantially. For example, initiation of mitochondrial DNA replication occurs throughout the cell cycle, whereas initiation of nuclear DNA synthesis is limited to S phase. Moreover, mitochondria do not utilize any of the enzymes required at DNA replication forks in mammalian nuclei (17Clayton D.A. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 141: 217-232Google Scholar). Although SV40 and nuclear DNA synthesis appear to share most of the enzymes required at replication forks, initiation of SV40 replication differs significantly in that it is controlled by the viral-encoded origin recognition protein large tumor antigen (T-ag), and it is not limited to one initiation event per cell cycle (18DePamphilis M.L. Bradley M.K. Salzman N.P. The Papovaviridae. Vol. 1. Plenum Press, New York1986: 99-246Google Scholar). The mechanism by which nuclear DNA replication is initiated is as yet unknown, but it restricts cellular chromosomes to one initiation event per origin per S phase (19Gilbert D.M. Cohen S.N. Cell. 1987; 50: 59-68Google Scholar). Xenopus eggs provide the most well characterized system that can initiate replication in non-viral DNA sequences as well as continue DNA synthesis at replication forks. Like mammalian cells, DNA replication in Xenopus eggs is restricted to one initiation event per cell cycle (20Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Google Scholar). However, in contrast to mammalian cells, which initiate replication at specific chromosomal loci (21DePamphilis M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1-4Google Scholar), Xenopus eggs can initiate replication within most (perhaps all) DNA sequences that are presented to them (22Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. Nallaseth F.S. Ortega J.M. Blow J.J. DePamphilis M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 475-485Google Scholar, 23Hyrien O. Méchali M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1463-1469Google Scholar, 24Mahbubani H.M. Paull T. Elder J.K. Blow J.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1457-1462Google Scholar). Furthermore, whereas initiation of replication in mammalian chromosomes requires specific DNA sequences (25Kitsberg D. Selig S. Keshet I. Cedar H. Nature. 1993; 366: 588-590Google Scholar), initiation of replication in Xenopus eggs does not (22Gilbert D.M. Miyazawa H. Nallaseth F.S. Ortega J.M. Blow J.J. DePamphilis M.L. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1993; 58: 475-485Google Scholar, 26Harland R.M. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1980; 21: 761-771Google Scholar). The results of our study indicated that mimosine inhibited DNA synthesis in cellular, mitochondrial, and SV40 chromosomes to the same extent despite fundamental differences in the way these types of chromosomes are replicated. Furthermore, mimosine had the same inhibitory effect on elongation of nascent DNA chains in both cellular and SV40 replicating chromosomes as did aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of replicative DNA polymerases. Finally, in parallel with its inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis, prolonged mimosine treatment altered intracellular levels of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) in a manner similar to that of another DNA replication inhibitor that affects deoxyribonucleotide metabolism, hydroxyurea. These results demonstrate that mimosine can block cell cycle progression within S phase at the level of elongation of nascent DNA chains by causing the depletion of intracellular pools of deoxyribonucleotides. This is consistent with our observation that, in contrast to aphidicolin, mimosine did not inhibit DNA replication in lysates of mammalian cells supplied with an exogenous source of deoxyribonucleotides or in extracts of Xenopus eggs or intact Xenopus eggs, both of which contain high levels of deoxyribonucleotides. Consequently, studies that have employed mimosine to block cell cycle progression in late G1may require reinterpretation. CHO1 1The abbreviations used are: CHOChinese hamster ovarykbkilobase(s).

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Mitochondrial DNA replication was quantified by scanning densitometry of autoradiograms that were exposed within the linear response range of the film. BSC-1 monkey cells (50% confluence) in 10-cm dishes were infected with SV40 virus (m.o.i. = 10). At 24 h post-infection, either 0.4 m M mimosine or 5 μg/ml aphidicolin was added to the medium, and 3 h later, nascent viral DNA was labeled with 50 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine (80 Ci/mmol) (Amersham) for 15 min. The cells were then lysed with 3 ml/plate of 10 m M EDTA, 0.6% SDS (31Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Google Scholar). After 5 min, 1 ml of 5 M NaCl was added dropwise to each plate, and lysates were transferred gently to Falcon 2059 tubes, chilled on ice overnight to precipitate cellular DNA, and then centrifuged in a Beckman JS13.1 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 30 min (4°C) to remove cellular DNA. DNA in the supernatant was extracted with phenol and chloroform-isoamyl alcohol, precipitated with ethanol, dissolved in distilled water (100 μl/dish of cells), and then adjusted to 150 m M NaCl with a 10× buffer stock (New England BioLabs) appropriate for digesting DNA with BamHI. DNA was analyzed by neutral-neutral two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (32Brewer B.J. Fangman W.L. Cell. 1987; 51: 463-471Google Scholar). Aliquots (10 μl) of purified SV40 DNA were digested with a 10-fold excess of BamHI for 2 h at 37°C and then applied to a 0.6% agarose gel in a 40 m M Tris acetate and 1 m M EDTA (40Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5912-5918Google Scholar) containing 3 μg/ml ethidium bromide and subjected to electrophoresis for 16 h at 1 V/cm (ambient temperature). DNA was visualized by 360 nm UV irradiation to excise each lane accurately. Each excised lane was laid across the top of a 1% agarose gel in 45 m M Tris borate, 1 m M EDTA, and 30 μg/ml ethidium bromide (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.

Electrophoresis in the second dimension was carried out in buffer containing ethidium bromide at 4°C for 20 h at 6 V/cm. DNA was then transferred to nylon membranes (GeneScreen Plus) and probed with 32P-labeled SV40 DNA, and replication intermediates were visualized by exposure to Phosphorimager screens (Molecular Dynamics). Alternatively, gels were prepared for fluorography to visualize nascent [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA as described above. CHO C400 cells were synchronized in G0by isoleucine deprivation and then subjected to one of three protocols. G1phase cells were prepared by releasing them into Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with nonessential amino acids and 10% fetal bovine serum (complete medium) for 2 h. Mimosine-arrested cells were prepared by releasing them into complete medium containing 0.4 m M mimosine for 12 h. Aphidicolin-arrested cells were prepared by releasing them into complete medium containing 5 μg/ml aphidicolin for 12 h and then replacing the aphidicolin-containing medium with prewarmed complete medium and incubating them for an additional 5 min. Cells were harvested by trypsinization, counted, and transferred to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes (5 million cells/tube) on ice, washed with cold hypotonic buffer (33Heintz N.H. Stillman B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1923-1931Google Scholar), and finally swollen for 10 min on ice in hypotonic buffer. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, supernatant completely removed, and then lysed in the same microcentrifuge tube by homogenization with 20 strokes of a Kontes pellet pestle. Nuclei were then isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 3 min (4°C) in an Eppendorf 5415C microcentrifuge and resuspended in 100 μl of S phase extract prepared from CHO K1 cells (33Heintz N.H. Stillman B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1923-1931Google Scholar). To this mixture, 25 μl of 5× replication mixture (33Heintz N.H. Stillman B.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1923-1931Google Scholar) was added; the mixture was then transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 20 μl of lyophilized [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham). Tubes were incubated at 37°C, and 25-μl aliquots were taken at 10, 20, 30, 60, and 120 min. These samples were added to 300 μl of 0.5% SDS, 50 m M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and 10 m M EDTA to stop the reaction. Acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured from 50-μl aliquots of this cell lysate by addition of trichloroacetic acid (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from the remaining sample by digesting it with 100 μg/ml Proteinase K for 2 h at 56°C and then extracting once with phenol:chloroform and once with chloroform alone before adding 100 μl of 7.5 M ammonium acetate and adjusting the solution to 80% ethanol. DNA was precipitated, resuspended in EcoRI buffer (New England BioLabs), digested with 15 units EcoRI, and fractionated by electrophoresis in an 0.65% agarose gel containing 45 m M Tris borate and 1 m M EDTA (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) for 14 h at 2.3 V/cm and 21°C. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film at room temperature. Xenopus egg extracts and Xenopus sperm chromatin were prepared as described by Blow and Laskey (20Blow J.J. Laskey R.A. Cell. 1986; 47: 577-587Google Scholar). Sperm chromatin was added to 20 μl of extract supplemented with 0.5 μl of [α-32P]dATP (6000 Ci/mmol) (Amersham) to a final concentration of 3 ng of DNA/μl extract, and the indicated concentrations of mimosine or aphidicolin were added. Extracts were incubated at 21°C, and at the indicated times, 2.5-μl aliquots were removed, and DNA was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). For analysis of plasmid replication, 1.6 ng of pneoS13 (34Anachkova B. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 532-540Google Scholar) was injected into unactivated Xenopus eggs that were activated 2 h later by addition of Ca2+ and Ca2+ ionophore A24187 (35Wangh L.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 93: 1-8Google Scholar). Ten eggs were collected at each of the indicated times and pooled, and plasmid DNA was isolated from each pool of eggs. One-tenth of the plasmid DNA was supplemented with 300 ng of bacteriophage λ DNA to provide an internal standard to monitor subsequent digestions and to ensure complete digestion with DpnI (36Sanchez J.A. Marek D. Wangh L.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 907-918Google Scholar). DNA was digested for 1 h with 5 units of DpnI (New England BioLabs) per ng of isolated plasmid DNA in buffer 4 (New England BioLabs) supplemented with 200 m M NaCl to prevent cleavage of hemimethylated DNA (36Sanchez J.A. Marek D. Wangh L.J. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 907-918Google Scholar). All forms of DpnI-resistant DNA as well as identical aliquots that were not digested with DpnI were subsequently converted to linear molecules with PvuI, and the products fractionated by electrophoresis in 0.65% agarose gels in 45 m M Tris borate and 1 m M EDTA for 15 h at 2.4 V/cm (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA was then transferred to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N+, Amersham) by capillary blotting using 0.4 M NaOH and 0.6 M NaCl. DNA on the membrane was hybridized with pUC19 32P-DNA (37Gilbert D.M. Losson R. Chambon P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4525-4531Google Scholar), and the amount of linear monomeric plasmid DNA was determined by scanning the filters in a Betagen Betascope 603. Identical aliquots of plasmid DNA were digested with 5 units of MboI (New England BioLabs) in buffer 4 (New England Biolabs). DNA was hybridized with 32P-labeled neomycin gene (0.75-kb PvuII fragment of pSV2neo). The amount of the largest MboI DNA digestion product, a 0.56-kb 32P-DNA band, was determined by scanning filters in the Betascope. dNTPs were extracted according to the method of Skoog and Nordenskjold (48Skoog L. Nordenskjold B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1971; 19: 81-89Google Scholar). Briefly, 10-cm plates containing ∼106exponentially proliferating CHO C400 cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into ice-cold 60% methanol (1 ml/plate). Lysates were stored at −20°C overnight and were then centrifuged to remove cell debris. The supernatant was evaporated to dryness, and dNTPs were redissolved in 100 μl/plate water. Amounts of dNTP in the extracts were determined by measuring incorporation by Klenow enzyme of complementary [3H]dNTPs in DNA synthesis reactions using 10 μl of extract and poly(dA·dT) or poly(dI·dC) as a template (39Newport J. Dasso M. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 12: 149-160Google Scholar). To determine whether the effects of mimosine were specific to nuclear DNA synthesis, the ability of mimosine to inhibit [3H]thymidine incorporation into both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA was tested in CHO cells. One group of cells was treated with various concentrations of mimosine for 3 h and then, in the continued presence of mimosine, incubated with [3H]thymidine for 20 min. Total cellular DNA was isolated, digested with EcoRI restriction endonuclease, and then fractionated by gel electrophoresis. A second group of cells was treated in the same manner except that 1-(β- D-arabinofuranosyl)cytosine was included to specifically inhibit nuclear DNA synthesis and thus reveal the presence of mitochondrial DNA restriction fragments (30Burhans W.C. Selegue J.E. Heintz N.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7790-7794Google Scholar). These data revealed that mimosine inhibited both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA synthesis (Fig. 1). Moreover, the sensitivities of mtDNA and nuclear DNA synthesis to mimosine were indistinguishable. Both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA synthesis were inhibited to the same extent at the same concentrations of mimosine (Fig. 2 A), and the rates of recovery for both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA synthesis upon removal of mimosine were the same (Fig. 2 B). These results suggested that mimosine acts on some metabolic pathway that is common to both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA replication. Furthermore, since mtDNA replication occurs throughout the cell cycle and the length of the mimosine treatment of exponentially proliferating cells in these experiments was a small fraction of the total time required for cell division (∼20 h), mimosine must inhibit mtDNA replication throughout the entire cell cycle, not just during S phase.Figure 2:Characteristics of mimosine inhibition of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA replication were the same. A, exponentially proliferating cultures of CHO C400 cells were treated for 3 h with mimosine at the indicated concentration. [3H]Thymidine was added for 20 min. Nuclear DNA synthesis (□) was quantified in cells not treated with araC by acid precipitation of total cellular DNA, while mtDNA synthesis (●) was quantified in cells treated with araC by densitometry of fluorographs as described in Fig. 1. AraC suppressed nuclear DNA synthesis and thus revealed mtDNA synthesis (Fig. 1). Relative DNA synthesis was expressed as a percentage of the amount detected in untreated cultures or just prior to addition of mimosine (time = 0). B, exponentially proliferating cultures of CHO C400 cells were treated with 0.4 m M mimosine for 3 h to completely arrest DNA synthesis and then released from mimosine arrest by washing them twice with fresh medium without mimosine and culturing them in the absence of mimosine for the times indicated. [3H]Thymidine was added for 20 min, and both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA synthesis was measured as in panel A. C, cells were synchronized at their G1/S boundary with aphidicolin (see “Materials and Methods”) and then released from the aphidicolin block in the presence of 0.4 m M mimosine (solid symbols). Replicating mtDNA was monitored as in previous experiments except that nuclear DNA replication was suppressed by not withdrawing aphidicolin from the culture medium (rather than the addition of araC). Exponentially proliferating cells were also treated with 0.4 m M mimosine and analyzed in parallel as in panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In previous studies, a crucial observation was that mimosine took substantially longer to arrest DNA synthesis in cells that had been synchronized at the beginning of their S phase with aphidicolin than in unsynchronized cells that were proliferating exponentially (7Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Google Scholar). Aphidicolin does not prevent synthesis of short RNA-p-DNA chains that precede formation of Okazaki fragments (40Nethanel T. Kaufmann G. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 5912-5918Google Scholar). Thus, aphidicolin allows both SV40 (41Decker R.S. Yamaguchi M. Possenti R. DePamphilis M.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3815-3825Google Scholar) and cellular (5Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3715-3722Google Scholar) chromosomes to initiate DNA replication by forming replication forks but limits subsequent DNA synthesis according to the dose and time of exposure. Therefore, the delayed response to mimosine suggested that mimosine inhibition did not occur until new initiation events took place to continue S phase, analogous to the “slow-stop” phenotype that characterizes mutations in genes required specifically to initiate replication in bacteria and yeast (9Kornberg A. Baker T. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York1992Google Scholar). We were able to confirm this observation with mimosine inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis. When CHO C400 cells were synchronized with aphidicolin near the G1/S boundary (shortly after entry into S phase) and released from the aphidicolin block into medium containing mimosine, inhibition of DNA replication did not begin until 2-3 h and was complete after a 4-5-h incubation (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, inhibition of DNA synthesis in exponentially proliferating cells began 30-60 min after mimosine addition and was completed after 2-3 h (Fig. 2 C). These data on mimosine inhibition of nuclear DNA synthesis are in excellent agreement with those of Mosca et al. (7Mosca P.J. Dijkwel P.A. Hamlin J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4375-4383Google Scholar). However, we observed the same phenomenon with mtDNA synthesis. Since mtDNA replication responded in an identical manner even though mtDNA replication is not affected by aphidicolin, the delayed response phenotype in G1/S cells cannot be related to synchronization of chromosomal replicons by aphidicolin. The fact that mimosine inhibition of nuclear and mtDNA synthesis were indistinguishable under all conditions strongly suggests that mimosine does not specifically inhibit some step in the initiation of cellular chromosome replication. To examine directly the effects of mimosine on DNA replication forks, replication of SV40 DNA was analyzed in mimosine-treated virus-infected monkey cells. At 24 h post-infection, BSC-1 cells were cultured for 3 h with different amounts of mimosine. Uninfected cultures were treated in parallel. Cells were then incubated with [3H]thymidine for 2"
https://openalex.org/W2077041565,"GRP94 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized glycoprotein with Ca2+binding and protein chaperoning properties. Using a ribozyme driven by a stress-inducible promoter and targeted against grp94 mRNA, we have generated a cell line deficient in its ability to induce GRP94. The effect of the ribozyme is mediated by the cleavage of the grp94 message just downstream of the initiation codon, and not by an antisense effect, as determined by the level of intact grp94 mRNA. Unexpectedly, this cell line's ability to induce GRP78 is also impaired. Transient overexpression of recombinant human lysosomal hydrolase α- L-iduronidase in the ribozyme expressing cells indicates that the secretion ratio of this enzyme is reduced by about 6-fold. Additionally, the ribozyme expressing cells showed increased sensitivity to Ca2+depletion from ER caused by either A23187 or thapsigargin, an ER-Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor, but not to tunicamycin. These combined results show that the induction of GRP94 may play important roles in ER to nuclear signaling, protein sorting and secretion, and specific protection against Ca2+depletion stress.

The ER is also an important store for intracellular Ca2+. Residing within the ER is a class of proteins known as the glucose-regulated proteins (GRPs) (Lee, 1987Lee A.S. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Google Scholar; Hightower, 1991Hightower L.E. Cell. 1991; 66: 191-197Google Scholar; Little et al., 1994Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic. Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 1-18Google Scholar). The GRPs are ubiquitously expressed stress-inducible proteins that are related to the heat shock proteins (HSPs) (Watowich and Morimoto, 1988Watowich S.S. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 393-405Google Scholar; Wooden and Lee, 1992Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. DNA Sequence. 1992; 3: 41-48Google Scholar). GRP94, a 94-kDa protein also referred to as ERp99 (Mazzarella and Green, 1987Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Google Scholar) or endoplasmin (Koch et al., 1986Koch G. Smith M. Macer D. Webster P. Mortata R. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 86: 217-232Google Scholar), is an abundant ER glycoprotein. It shares 50% amino acid identity to HSP90, the 90-kDa member of the heat shock protein family (Mazzarella and Green, 1987Mazzarella R.A. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8875-8883Google Scholar). The function of HSP90 as a molecular chaperone is exemplified by its ability to bind to a wide range of cellular proteins, including that of the glucocorticoid receptor and pp60src (Hutchison et al., 1993Hutchison K.A. Scherrer L.C. Czar M.J. Stancato L.F. Chow Y.F. Jove R. Pratt W.B. Ann. New York Acad.

Recent evidence suggests that GRP94 may also possess protein chaperoning activity since its synthesis is induced by the accumulation of malfolded proteins in the ER (Kim et al., 1987Kim Y.K. Kim K.S. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 553-559Google Scholar; Kozutsumi et al., 1988Kozutsumi Y. Segal M. Normington K. Gething M.J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1988; 332: 462-464Google Scholar). GRP94, together with other ER molecular chaperones, has been found to form stable complexes with viral and cellular proteins in the ER. For example, a mutant form of the herpes simplex virus 1 glycoprotein B with altered conformation accumulates in the ER. GRP94 and GRP78, a 78-kDa ER lumen protein, stably complexed with the mutant gB but not with the fully processed viral protein (Navarro et al., 1992Navarro D. Paz P. Pereira L. Virology. 1992; 186: 99-112Google Scholar; Ramakrishnan et al., 1995Ramakrishnan M. Tugizov S. Pereira L. Lee A.S. DNA Cell Biol. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Similarly, major histocompatibility complex class II molecules expressed in the absence of the invariant chain remained in an immature form in the ER and are associated with GRP94 and ERp72, another member of the GRP family (Schaiff et al., 1992Schaiff W.T. Hruska K.A. McCourt W.D. Green M. Schwartz B.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 657-666Google Scholar). Recently, GRP94 has also been shown to participate in normal protein folding and assembly. In the ER, GRP78 and GRP94 act in tandem on folding intermediates of the newly synthesized immunoglobulin chains, with GRP94 assisting at a more advanced step in their processing (Melnick et al., 1992Melnick J. Ariel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21303-21306Google Scholar, Melnick et al., 1994Melnick J. Dul J.L. Argon Y. Nature. 1994; 370: 373-375Google Scholar). In another study, GRP94 has been demonstrated to be associated with an ATPase activity and contain tightly bound peptides (Li and Srivastava, 1993Li Z. Srivastava K.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3143-3151Google Scholar). Other lines of evidence strongly suggest that GRP94 and other ER lumen proteins are major Ca2+-binding proteins. While the binding affinity for Ca2+is low, GRP94 and GRP78 can bind superstoichiometric amounts of Ca2+(Koch et al., 1986Koch G. Smith M. Macer D. Webster P. Mortata R. J. Cell Sci. 1986; 86: 217-232Google Scholar), of which the ER is a major store. The GRP94 and GRP78 are also present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles of cardiac and skeletal muscles, another organelle known to contain high levels of Ca2+(Milner et al., 1992Milner R.E. Famulski K.S. Michalak M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 112: 1-13Google Scholar; Volpe et al., 1992Volpe P. Villa A. Martini A. Nori A. Panzeri M.C. Meldolesi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, as low affinity but high capacity Ca2+-binding proteins, GRPs may play significant roles in protein trafficking (Gething and Sambrook, 1992Gething M.-J. Sambrook J. Nature. 1992; 355: 33-45Google Scholar) and intracellular Ca2+homeostasis (Brostrom et al., 1990Brostrom M.A. Cade C. Prostko C.R. Gmitter-Yellen D. Brostrom C.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20539-20546Google Scholar). GRP94, while expressed constitutively in most cell types under normal growth conditions, is highly induced in stressed cells. The most potent inducing reagents are those that disrupt the ER function (Lee, 1987Lee A.S. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Google Scholar, Lee, 1992Lee A.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 267-273Google Scholar; Little et al., 1994Little E. Ramakrishnan M. Roy B. Gazit G. Lee A.S. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic. Gene Exp. 1994; 4: 1-18Google Scholar). This includes depletion of intracellular Ca2+by the calcium ionophore A23187 (Resendez et al., 1986Resendez Jr., E. Ting J. Kim K.S. Wooden S.K. Lee A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2145-2152Google Scholar; Drummond et al., 1987Drummond I.A.S. Lee A.S. Resendez Jr., E. Steinhardt R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12801-12805Google Scholar) and thapsigargin, which specifically inhibits the ER Ca2+-ATPase (Li et al., 1993Li W.W. Alexandre S. Cao X. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12003-12009Google Scholar). Another powerful inducer of GRP94 is the blockage of N-linked protein glycosylation through treatment of cells with tunicamycin or temperature-sensitive mutation of the oligosaccharide transferase (Lee et al., 1986Lee A.S. Wells S. Kim K.S. Scheffler I.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 277-282Google Scholar; Kim et al., 1987Kim Y.K. Kim K.S. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Physiol. 1987; 133: 553-559Google Scholar). With these and other stress treatments, there is a 10- and 25-fold increase in the transcriptional rates of grp94 and grp78, respectively. Furthermore, the two genes appear to be coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level through common trans-acting transcription factors recognizing common promoter elements (Lee, 1987Lee A.S. Trend Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 20-23Google Scholar; Chang et al., 1989Chang S.C. Erwin A. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2153-2162Google Scholar). For instance, amplification of a transfected plasmid containing the common promoter regulatory elements led to the titration of the trans-acting factors from the endogenous genes. This resulted in a concomitant reduction of GRP94, GRP78, and ERp72, slower growth rates, and increased sensitivity of cells to the calcium ionophore A23187 (Li and Lee, 1991Li X. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3446-3453Google Scholar). To dissect the functional contribution of the individual GRPs and to understand their coregulation mechanism, it is necessary to inhibit the expression of each of the GRPs and study the resulting phenotypes. Here we report the successful use of a targeted ribozyme driven by a stress-inducible grp promoter to modulate the level of grp94 mRNA in stressed and non-stressed mammalian cells. Ribozymes are small RNAs that can catalytically cleave a phosphodiester bond in the target RNA (Forster and Symons, 1987Forster A. Symons R.H. Cell. 1987; 50: 9-16Google Scholar; Koizumi et al., 1988Koizumi M. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. FEBS Lett. 1988; 228: 228-230Google Scholar). While engineered ribozymes have been used successfully to reduce gene expression in vivo, in many of these studies it is not clear that gene expression has been reduced by the cleaving activity of the ribozyme or by its inherent antisense activity (Castanotto et al., 1992Castanotto D. Rossi J.J. Peshler J.O. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1992; 2: 331-357Google Scholar). Further, the use of tissue-specific or inducible promoters to modulate ribozyme expression in inhibiting cellular gene expression has only been explored recently (Zhao and Pick, 1993Zhao J.J. Pick L. Nature. 1993; 365: 448-451Google Scholar; Efrat et al., 1994Efrat S. Leiser M. Wu Y.J. Fusco-DeMane D. Emran O.A. Surana M. Letton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Weir G. Fleischer N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2051-2055Google Scholar). We show here that a “hammerhead” ribozyme targeted against the grp94 transcript is able to cleave the grp94 RNA both in vitro and in vivo. Upon stress treatment, induced higher level of the ribozyme is able to significantly reduce the level of intact grp94 mRNA, leading to minimal stress induction of the GRP94 protein. To our surprise, in the transfected cells which exhibit impaired GRP94 induction, the level of stress-inducible grp78 mRNA and protein is reduced by half. With the establishment of these stable cell lines, we examined the role of GRP94 as a molecular chaperone in protein trafficking. The highly glycosylated enzyme α- L-iduronidase (EC 3.2.1.76) is translated into the ER and later processed in the Golgi (Rome et al., 1978Rome L.H. Garvin A.J. Neufeld E.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1978; 189: 344-353Google Scholar). The majority of this protein is normally targeted to the lysosome by means of a mannose 6-phosphate marker, but a small fraction is secreted. Overproduction of this protein in mammalian cells causes it to be selectively secreted at a higher rate (Kakkis et al., 1994Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Google Scholar). In overexpressing this human recombinant protein in the ribozyme expressing cells, we observed that the secretion ratio of this enzyme is much impaired. Additionally, we compared the protective roles of GRPs in calcium homeostasis and glycosylation block. The increased sensitivity to A23187 and thapsigargin but not tunicamycin in ribozyme expressing cells shows that GRP94 plays an important protective role in cells under Ca2+stress conditions, but may not be sufficient to confer protection against glycosylation block stress. The possible role of GRP94 as a mediator in the grp stress response is also discussed. The λgt10 library used to isolate the full-length rat grp94 cDNA clone was generously provided by Dr. Jonathon Howard (Cambridge Research Station). About 105bacteriophage plaques were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Scheider and Schuell) in duplicate. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were as described previously (Ting and Lee, 1988Ting J. Lee A.S. DNA. 1988; 7: 275-286Google Scholar), except the probe used was the 1-kb BamHI- EcoRI fragment of the hamster grp94 cDNA from the plasmid p4A3 (Lee et al., 1983Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Google Scholar). This fragment was hexamer-labeled (Feinberg and Vogelstein, 1983Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Google Scholar) to a specific activity of approximately 5 × 108cpm/μg. Nineteen plaques were detected and purified with two more rounds of plaque hybridization. The largest insert was identified by EcoRI digestion of the positive clones and subcloned into the EcoRI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). The 5′ and 3′ ends of the cDNA were sequenced using the dideoxy chain termination method (Sanger et al., 1977Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) to verify the initiation codon and poly(A) addition signal. This clone was designated pBS94. The plasmid pRc/RSV was purchased from Invitrogen, pUC8 from New England Biolabs, and pSP65 from Promega. The pRc/GRP plasmid was derived from the pRc/RSV plasmid. It was constructed by removing the RSV LTR promoter from the pRc/RSV plasmid by digestion with NruI and HindIII and purifying the 4.7-kb vector fragment from low melting point agarose. The proximal 1.3 kb of the rat grp78 promoter was isolated from the plasmid p2I (Resendez et al., 1985Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Google Scholar) by digestion with PstI and BssHII and followed by purification from low melting point agarose. The two DNA fragments were blunt end-ligated. Correct insertion of the new promoter was verified by restriction digests. The plasmid pUC-ribo1 was constructed as follows: 1 nmol each of 2 oligo-nucleotides, 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGG-3′, and 5′-ATGAGGGTTTCGTCCTCACGGACTCATCAGCTGTGGGTCCCTATAGTGAGTCGTATTA-3′, were used. The underlined region indicates the T7 polymerase site. These oligomers were annealed by heating to 85°C for 3 min, then cooling to room temperature. The resulting hemi-duplex was filled in by Klenow DNA polymerase and kinased by T4 polynucleotide kinase. The double-stranded DNA was eluted by crush-soak method from an ethidium bromide-stained 6% polyacrylamide gel and ethanol-precipitated. This fragment was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC8. pSP65-ribo1 was constructed by cloning the 93-bp HindIII- EcoRI fragment from pUC-ribo1 into the HindIII- EcoRI-digested pSP65. pRc/RSV-ribo1 was constructed by cloning the 72-bp BamHI- EcoRI fragment from pUC-ribo1 into the NotI-digested pRc/RSV. pRc/GRP-ribo1 was constructed by cloning the 72-bp BamHI- EcoRI fragment from pUC-ribo1 into the NotI-digested pRc/GRP. The correct orientation of the ribozyme in each of the expression plasmids was confirmed by DNA sequencing. In Vitro Ribozyme Assay-Two μg of EcoRI linearized pUC-ribo1 was transcribed with T7 DNA polymerase in a buffer containing 40 m M Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 50 m M NaCl, 8 m M MgCl2, 2 m M Spermidine, 200 n M ATP, CTP, and GTP, 20 n M UTP, 20 μCi of [32P]UTP (DuPont NEN), 150 n M dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin. The target of the ribozyme catalyzed cleavage was transcribed from the FokI-digested pBS94 essentially as above, but with 40 units of T3 RNA polymerase, 80 n M UTP, and 30 μCi of [32P]UTP. The target RNA was purified by PAGE and excising the 260 nt band (detected by exposing the wet gel to Kodak X-OMAT film) and eluted by crush-soak method. The in vitro cleavage reaction generally contained approximately 0.1 pmol OF target RNA and 10-fold excess of ribozyme, incubated in 10 μl of 50 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 m M MgCl2, 1 m M EDTA at 50°C for 1, 2, and 4 h. One-fifth volume of 0.5 M EDTA was added as the reactions were completed to stop the reactions. The reaction mixes were kept at −80°C until all reactions were complete. The products were separated on a 6% PAGE, which was then dried and exposed to film at −80°C for 16 h. The NRK cell lines, their culture conditions, and DNA transfection protocols have been previously described (Resendez et al., 1985Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Google Scholar). 400 μg/ml G418 was added 2 days after transfection. Survivors were pooled after 3 weeks and maintained under the same selection conditions. Cell survival studies were performed by seeding 2,000 cells/10-cm dish in duplicate for each of the concentration of drugs used as described previously (Li and Lee, 1991Li X. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3446-3453Google Scholar). Growth rates of each construct were measured as described previously (Li and Lee, 1991Li X. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3446-3453Google Scholar), except that 50,000 cells were seeded per 10-cm dish. Each experiment was repeated twice. Cells were seeded in 15-cm dishes and harvested after reaching 100% confluence. DNA was extracted as described previously (Li and Lee, 1991Li X. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3446-3453Google Scholar). Ten μg of the respective DNA was digested with PvuII or EcoRI at 10 units/μg DNA at 37°C for 16 h. These digests were run on a 1.2% agarose gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The DNA was cross-linked to the membrane by UV irradiation (Stratagene UV Stratalinker 2400). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing conditions were as described previously (Li and Lee, 1991Li X. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3446-3453Google Scholar). The probe made to detect the constructs was generated by digesting the pRc/GRP-ribo1 plasmid with EcoRI and isolated from a 1% low melting agarose gel. The 1 kb band was then excised and labeled directly via hexamer labeling to an approximate activity of 5 × 108cpm/μg. Cells were seeded in duplicate in 15-cm dishes. Once cell density reached approximately 70-80% confluence, the media was replaced with fresh media. To one dish of each set was added the appropriate GRP inducing agent (7 μM A23187 or 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin). After 16 h, the media was removed, and the cells washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. Conditions for RNA isolation, gel electrophoresis, and blot hybridization have been described (Lee et al., 1983Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Google Scholar). The first probe was generated by digesting the pBS94 clone with NlaIII and isolating the 1 kb band from a low melting point agarose gel. This probe contained approximately 900 bp of plasmid sequence and the first 104 bp of the rat grp94 cDNA. Grp78 cDNA (Lee et al., 1983Lee A.S. Delegeane A.M. Baker V. Chow P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 597-603Google Scholar) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA (Tso et al., 1985Tso J.Y. Sun X.-M. Kao T.-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Google Scholar) probes were also used. Probes were hexamer labeled to an approximate specific activity of 5 × 108cpm/μg. For detection of ribozyme transcript, an SP6 antisense probe was synthesized from HindIII-linearized pSP65-ribo1 and hybridized to total RNA samples, and analyzed essentially as described (Naeve et al., 1992Naeve G.S. Sharma A. Lee A.S. Cell Growth Diff. 1992; 3: 919-928Google Scholar), with the exception that the hybridization temperature was 42°C. Protected fragments were separated on 6% sequencing gels, which were then dried and exposed to film at −80°C with an intensifying screen. The transcribed probe was 105 nt, and a protected 72-nt fragment was expected from the in vivo transcribed ribozyme. As a control, the ribozyme was also transcribed in vitro with T7 polymerase (40 m M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 m M NaCl, 8 m M MgCl2, 2 m M Spermidine, 200 n M NTP, 150 n M dithiothreitol, 40 units of RNasin, 40 units of T7 RNA polymerase) and hybridized with the probe. The expected protected size for the in vitro transcribed ribozyme was a 48-nt fragment. Seventy % confluent cells were labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine (DuPont NEN) in duplicate in 10-cm dishes in 5 ml of methionine-free media containing 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum. One dish from each set was treated with the appropriate GRP inducing agent (7 μM A23187 or 1.5 μg/ml tunicamycin). Proteins were isolated as described previously (Li et al., 1992Li L.-J. Li X. Ferrario A. Rucker N. Liu E.S. Wong S. Gomer C.J. Lee A.S. J. Cell. Phys. 1992; 153: 575-582Google Scholar) and separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE as described by Laemmli, 1970Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar using 106cpm from each sample. Proteins from non-labeled control and A23187-induced cells from the pRc/GRP and pRc/GRP-ribo1 cell lines were isolated and resuspended in RIPA buffer (10 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 m M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin). Quantitation of the protein was determined by the Bio-Rad Protein assay. For GRP94, 40 μg from each cell line were separated on denaturing SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretically to Immun-Lite Blotting Membrane (Bio-Rad). For GRP78, 120 μg of total protein was required. Equal loading of the protein samples was confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining. The protocol described in the Immun-Lite Assay kit (Bio-Rad) was used for protein detection with the exception that blocking was performed in 2.5% non-fat dry milk in 1 × TBS (20 m M Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 500 m M NaCl) for GRP78. For GRP94, 1% non-fat dry milk and 0.5 × TBS were used. The primary antibodies were rat monoclonal anti-GRP94 and mouse monoclonal anti-GRP78 antibodies (Stressgen) at dilutions of 1:1,000 and 1:500, respectively. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rat antibody (Oncogene Science) and goat anti-mouse (Bio-Rad) at dilutions of 1:3,000 were used as the secondary antibodies. 7.5 × 105cells from each of the cell lines were seeded in 10-cm dishes in triplicate. Two days later, the cells were transiently cotransfected with 10 μg each of the human α- L-iduronidase expression plasmid pRc/CMV-huId (Kakkis et al., 1994Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Google Scholar) and the β-galactosidase expression plasmid pRc/CMV-β-gal (both are a gift of Dr. Emil Kakkis, UCLA Harbor) by the calcium phosphate method as described previously (Wooden et al., 1991Wooden S.K. Li L.- J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Google Scholar). Two days after transfection aliquots of the media were removed from each dish and assayed for secreted α- L-iduronidase activity (Kakkis et al., 1994Kakkis E.D. Matynia A. Jonas A.J. Neufeld E.F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1994; 5: 225-232Google Scholar). The cell pellets were split to assay for intracellular α- L-iduronidase and β-galactosidase activities (Wooden et al., 1991Wooden S.K. Li L.- J. Navarro D. Qadri I. Pereira L. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5612-5623Google Scholar) as described. The latter was used to standardize the transfection efficiencies of each dish of cells. A full-length rat grp94 cDNA was isolated from a λgt10 cDNA library and sequenced. Based on its 5′ terminus sequence, a hammerhead type ribozyme (Sarver et al., 1990Sarver N. Cantin E.M. Chang P.S. Zaia J.A. Ladne P.A. Stephens D.A. Rossi J.J. Science. 1990; 247: 1222-1225Google Scholar) was designed such that cleavage of the grp94 transcript by the ribozyme would occur close to the AUG initiation codon (Fig. 1). Sequencing of the grp94 cDNA further downstream revealed no in frame AUG codons for over 300 bases (data not shown). Thus, the truncated transcript, even if it remains stable, will not be able to be translated into GRP94. Additionally, if the ribozyme were to act through antisense base pairing with the transcript, it is likely to block translation initiation because of steric hindrance by the ribozyme at the region surrounding the AUG codon. This ribozyme, designated ribo1, contains 11 conserved nucleotides that make up three of the four conserved regions of the catalytic core. The remaining part of the catalytic center is derived from the grp94 mRNA at the GUC nucleotides starting at position 106. Cleavage is expected to occur 3′ to the cytosine residue, six nucleotides downstream from the initiation codon. First, to test whether ribo1 could act as predicted in vitro, a ribozyme was generated by in vitro transcription. This was done using both a hemiduplex DNA oligomer containing a T7 polymerase site, and the EcoRI-linearized pUC-ribo1 plasmid, into which the ribozyme oligomer had been cloned. Yield from the pUC-ribo1 plasmid was much greater than from the hemiduplex; consequently all experiments used the pUC-ribo1 plasmid to generate ribozyme transcripts. The target RNA, a 260-nt transcript encoding the 5′ terminus of the grp94 transcript, was also generated by in vitro transcription. This transcript should be cleaved into two fragments of 176 and 84 nt by the ribo1 (Fig. 2 A). The integrity of the ribozyme and the target RNA after mock reactions is shown in Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 3, and the results of the cleavage reaction after 1, 2, and 4 h are shown in lanes 4-6. After 1 h of incubation with the ribozyme, the 260-nt target RNA was being cleaved to generate the expected products. The reaction was essentially complete after 4 h. Based on these positive results, ribo1 was engineered into expression vectors to test its ability to inhibit grp94 expression in mammalian cells. The grp94 gene is constitutively expressed at low basal levels. However, upon treatment of cells with the calcium ionophore A23187 or tunicamycin, there is about a 10-fold increase in its transcript levels. To overcome this, we inserted ribo1 into two mammalian expression vectors (Fig. 3). One vector is the commercially available plasmid pRc/RSV which uses the RSV LTR as the promoter to drive the transcription of ribo1. Since in many mammalian cell types the RSV LTR has proven to be a strong viral promoter, the high level of ribo1 produced constitutively might be sufficient to counteract the induced level of grp94 mRNA. In the other approach, we created a new expression vector by replacing the constitutive RSV LTR promoter with the proximal 1.3 kb of the rat grp78 promoter. This grp promoter fragment contains a large number of basal enhancing elements and confers full stress inducibility to chimeric gene products (Resendez et al., 1985Resendez Jr., E. Attenello J.W. Grafsky A. Chang C.S. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 1212-1219Google Scholar; Lin et al., 1986Lin A. Chang C. Lee A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 1235-1243Google Scholar). This expression vector, designated pRc/GRP-ribo1, is identical to pRc/RSV-ribo1 with the exception that pRc/GRP-ribo1 should direct high basal level as well as stress-induced high level expression of ribo1. Both vectors contain a neomycin resistance gene driven by the SV40 early promoter that allows selection of stable transfectants. Transfection of these constructs into NRK cells followed by selection with G418 resulted in stable integration of the plasmids, as demonstrated by genomic blot analysis (Fig. 4). Two convenient restriction sites, EcoRI and PvuII, were utilized to analyze the integration profile with the 1-kb EcoRI fragment from pRc/GRP-ribo1 (Fig. 4 A) as a probe. Comparison of the genomic blots with EcoRI-digested pRc/GRP-ribo1 plasmid shows the copy number of the integrated plasmids to be approximately 2 in all three cell lines (Fig. 4 B and data not shown). Southern blot analysis of these cells also benefitted from the presence of a PvuII site within the ribo1 oligomer. Because of this new site, genomic DNA from pRc/GRP-ribo1 and pRc/GRP transfectants digested with this enzyme yielded different patterns. As expected, pRc/GRP and pRc/GRP-ribo1 shared a common 1.1-kb fragment; however, the 0.5-kb fragment from pRc/GRP was cleaved to a 0.3-kb fragment in pRc/GRP-ribo1 due to the internal PvuII site from ribo1 (Fig. 4 C). Similar results were obtained for the pRc/RSV-ribo1 transfectants (data not shown). Thus, the integration of the appropriate plasmids"

Although multiple growth factors that activate EGFR (EGF, TGF-α, amphiregulin, and heparin binding EGF) are known, much less is known about the role of ligands that regulate the other members of this receptor family.

This specificity is obtained despite topological similarity generated by three conserved disulfide bonds in their core domains (Ref. 15, Fig. 1). A 65-amino acid EGF-like domain of heregulin β1, amino acids 177-241, was shown to be sufficient for high affinity binding and stimulation of p185B2 phosphorylation (2Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We have synthesized the receptor binding domain of heregulin β (HRGβ 177-241, I) and heregulin α (HRGα 177-239, IV) and utilized a series of truncated synthetic HRGs and EGF/HRG chimeric peptides (Fig. 2) to determine the essential structural elements of HRG receptor binding. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems (ABI) 430A peptide synthesizer using standard tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) chemistry protocols as provided (version 1.40; N-methylpyrrolidone/hydroxybenzotriazole). Acetic anhydride capping was employed after each activated ester coupling. The peptides were assembled on phenylacetamidomethyl polystyrene resin using standard side chain protection except for the use of t-Boc Glu(O-cyclohexyl) and t-Boc Asp(O-cyclohexyl). The peptides were deprotected using the “Low-High” hydrofluoric acid (HF) method of Tam et al. (23Tam J.P. Heath W.F. Merrifield R.B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6442-6455Crossref Scopus (518) Google Scholar) In each case crude HF product was purified by reverse phase HPLC (C-18 Vydac, 22×250 mm), diluted without drying into folding buffer (1 M urea, 100 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 m M oxidized glutathione, 0.75 m M reduced glutathione, 10 m M Met), and stirred for 48 h at 4°C. Folded, fully oxidized peptides were purified from the folding mixture by reverse phase HPLC and characterized by electrospray mass spectroscopy; quantities were determined by amino acid analysis. The heregulins and heregulin chimeras were analyzed for disulfide bonding in the following manner: first the peptide was cleaved with cyanogen bromide (CNBr), which opened up the peptide for further digestion. After removal of the CNBr, the peptide was digested sequentially with trypsin and endoproteinase Glu-C in order to obtain cleavage between the cysteines. Samples were analyzed using capillary liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and the disulfide bonding pattern was determined using the molecular weights of the fragmented peptides and shown to be the expected C1-C3, C2-C4, C5-C6 bonding pattern. Complete disulfide bonding patterns could not be determined for EGF and EGF chimera by this method, but the C5-C6 bond was confirmed. The primary sequence of each peptide is given in Fig. 2. Binding studies were done with SKBr3 cells because these cells express both EGF and HRG receptors. SKBr3 cells (ATCC, Rockville, MD) in 24-well tissue culture plates at ∼200,000 cells/well were changed to serum-free McCoy's medium 1-2 h prior to the binding assay. Heregulin β 177-241 was labeled with 125I using chloramine T to a specific activity of ∼200 μCi/μg. The binding assay was initiated by aspiration of the medium and addition of 1 ml of 0.05 μCi/ml (33 p M) 125I-heregulin β 177-241 and the competing peptides in ice-cold McCoy's medium. The cells were incubated at 4°C for 2 h with rocking. Binding was terminated by washing cells twice with 2 ml of ice-cold medium. The cells with bound heregulin were lysed in 200 μl of 0.1 N NaOH, 0.1% SDS. This lysate was then transferred to a scintillation vial, LSC fluid added (Ready Safe, Beckman Instruments), and 125I determined by scintillation counting. Specific binding is calculated by subtraction of nonspecific binding in the presence of 200 ng/ml of unlabeled HRG β1 177-241; typical values for controls were 3400 dpm specific binding and 220 dpm nonspecific. Scatchard analysis of the binding indicated a Kd of 150 p M for binding of 125I-heregulin to SKBr3 cells, in good agreement with previous reports (2Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). EGF binding was measured by the same method, but with 125I-EGF (DuPont NEN, 150-200 μCi/μg). Typical values for controls were 11,000 dpm specific binding and 400 dpm nonspecific binding. IC50 values were determined graphically from titrations over a range of four or five concentrations and are representative of two or more independent titrations. MCF-7, MDA-MB-468, or MDA-MB-453 cells as indicated (ATCC) were seeded at 100,000 cells/well in 24-well plates in 1 ml of McCoy's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and used the next day. The indicated peptide was added at 50 ng/ml and incubated 5 min at 37°C. The medium was removed by aspiration and the cells washed with TNK buffer (50 m M Tris HCl, pH 7.4, 140 m M NaCl, 3.3 m M KCl, 0.5 m M sodium orthovanadate) and lysed with 0.1 ml of boiling Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204082) Google Scholar). The lysate was placed in a boiling water bath for 10 min and then stored at −20°C for analysis the next day. Proteins in the extracts were separated by electrophoresis on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gel (84 × 70 mm, Integrated Separation Systems, Natick, MA), transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA), and probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY-20 (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) or PY-54 (Oncogene Science, Uniondale, NY). Phosphotyrosine-containing proteins were visualized by ECL reagents (Amersham Corp). For studies of p185 tyrosine phosphorylation in response to heregulin chimeras, we used MCF7 and MDA-MB-456 cells as reported previously (2Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). There was no detectable “basal” level of p185 autophosphorylation in MCF7 cells and HRG β 177-241 gave at least a 500-fold increase as determined by densitometry. MDA-MB-453 cells, which overexpress erbB2 (4Lupu R. Lippman M.E. Breast Cancer. Res. Treat. 1993; 27: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), respond to HRG β 177-241 with a 5.8-fold increase over the low basal (unstimulated) level. Autophosphorylation of EGFR was examined in MDA-MB-468 cells, which overexpress EGFR (4Lupu R. Lippman M.E. Breast Cancer. Res. Treat. 1993; 27: 83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). EGF gave a 16-fold increase in EGFR autophosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 cells over the unstimulated level as quantitated by densitometry. Heregulin and Neu differentiation factor are ∼45-kDa glycoproteins found in conditioned medium (2Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H.

They are produced by cleavage of a transmembrane glycoprotein with multiple domains, including a domain that is highly homologous to EGF (3Wen D. Peles E. Cupples R. Suggs S.V. Bacus S. Luo Y.

The biological activity of heregulin appears to reside in its EGF-like domain, because a recombinant protein consisting of amino acids 177-241 of HRGβ1 was shown to be active in both binding assays and in the stimulation of p185 tyrosine phosphorylation (2Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). We have further delineated the crucial domain of both HRGα and HRGβ and find that a 50-amino acid region (177-226) was fully active both for binding to cellular receptors and for stimulation of p185 phosphorylation (see, peptides II and V). Further truncation by a single amino acid (HRGβ 177-225, III) or two amino acids (HRGα 177-224, VI) reduced both the receptor binding and phosphorylation by > 100-fold. Interestingly, the 50-amino acid peptide (II) was somewhat more potent than the 65 amino acid heregulin fragment (I). Thus the critical regions for receptor binding and activation are contained within a 50-amino acid portion of the heregulins, beginning at amino acid 177 and ending at amino acid 226. It is possible however that the other domains of heregulin influence binding, receptor activation, and specificity in physiological situations. Alignment of the core regions of EGF and HRGβ (Fig. 2 B) shows the extensive homology between these factors. On the basis of the results with the truncated heregulins, we examined chimeras of EGF 1-48 and the core 50-amino acid region of HRGβ to determine the essential structural elements of HRG receptor binding and the basis for receptor binding selectivity. In HRGβ each of four separate intracysteine regions (amino acids 183-189, 191-195, 197-209, and 213-220) and the C terminus (amino acids 222-226) was replaced by the corresponding sequence from EGF (Fig. 2 B, proteins VIII-XII). In EGF, the corresponding intracysteine regions (amino acids 7-13, 15-19, 21-30, and 34-41) and the N terminus (amino acids 1-5) were replaced by the corresponding HRG sequences (Fig. 2 C, proteins XIII-XVII). These chimeras as well as HRGβ 177-241 and EGF were then evaluated in four distinct assays: 1) inhibition of 125I-EGF binding to SKBr3 cells, 2) inhibition of 125I-HRG binding to SKBr3 cells, 3) stimulation of EGFR autophosphorylation in MDA-MB-468 Cells, and 4) stimulation of p185 tyrosine phosphorylation in MDA-MB-453 and MCF7 cells. Substitution of any single cysteine-bound region of EGF or the EGF C terminus into HRG produced a chimera that retained full affinity for the HRG receptor and ability to stimulate p185 phosphorylation in cells, but had no affinity for the EGF receptor (, Fig. 3 A). The MDA-MB-453 cells examined (Fig. 3 A) have a low level of basal tyrosine phosphorylation of p185 (lanes 1 and 2) that is markedly increased (∼15-fold) on addition of HRGβ (peptide II, lane 3), but unaffected by addition of EGF (lane 4). All the HRG chimeras were potently active (VIII, X, XI, and XII are shown in lanes 6-9). Surprisingly, even the region comprising amino acids 197-209 of HRG, postulated to be involved in receptor binding (15Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Suzuki A. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), can be replaced with the smaller corresponding region of EGF (amino acids 21-30) without loss of HRG binding affinity. These results indicate that even with the substantial amino acid differences between EGF and HRG found in the regions between cysteine residues, neither these regions, nor the C terminus, contribute to the specificity of binding for EGFR versus HRG receptors. Substitution of the intracysteine HRG sequences 197-209 and 213-220 into EGF resulted in peptides (XV, XVI) that bound neither EGFR nor the HRG receptor with high affinity (Table II). EGF chimeras with substitution of the HRG sequences 183-189 (XIII) or 191-195 (XIV) retained some affinity for the EGF receptor, but had IC50 values about 1000-fold higher than EGF itself. EGF chimeras with substitutions of HRGβ sequences 197-209 (XV) and 213-220 (XVI) were unable to stimulate EGFR autophosphorylation, whereas EGF with substitution of HRGβ sequences 183-189 (XIII) or 191-195 (XIV) were active, but much less active than EGF (, Fig. 3B). These EGF chimeras incorporating HRG intracysteine regions (XIII-XVI) were also incapable of stimulating p185 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-453 cells (Table II) or MCF7 cells (not shown).Table II:Chimeric EGF/heregulin peptides: an analysis of the structural basis for selectivity Open table in a new tab Substitution of the HRG amino acids 177-181 (SHLVK) for the N terminus of EGF produced a chimera (XVII) which bound both receptors with high affinity (Table II). Specific binding of both EGF and HRG could be completely blocked by this chimera (Fig. 4). Chimera XVII was as active as EGF itself in the activation of EGFR autophosphorylation (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7 and 8) and was highly active in the stimulation of p185 tyrosine phosphorylation (, Fig. 3 A, lane 5). The EGF chimera with substitution of the HRG sequence 191-195 (XIV) had moderate affinity for both receptors. These results stimulated further investigation of the N-terminal sequence of heregulin/EGF chimera XVII. Individual nonconservative substitutions in this chimera at amino acids 181 (K to E, chimera XVIII), 180 (V to S, chimera XIX), or 179 (L to D, chimera XX) with the aligned amino acid from EGF had little effect on affinity for the heregulin receptor (Table II). However, removal of amino acids 177 and 178 reduced affinity for the heregulin receptor by > 10-fold (chimera XXI,) without a corresponding effect on affinity for the EGF receptor. This supports the conclusion that amino acids 177-181 are of specific importance for binding to the heregulin receptor. These data indicate that amino acids 177-181 (SHLVK) of heregulin are crucial for generating specific, high-affinity binding to its receptor, with the region 191-195 also contributing to binding specificity. Previous studies indicated that four N-terminal amino acids of TGF-α or EGF could be removed without substantial reduction of binding affinity, suggesting that the N terminus of neither EGF nor TGF-α is critical for binding to EGFR (16Defeo-Jones D. Tai J.Y. Wegrzyn R.J. Vuocolo G.A. Baker A.E. Payne L.S. Garsky V.M. Oliff A. Riemen M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2999-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 17Simpson R.J. Smith J.A.

Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Vol. 1. Springer-Verlag, New York1991: 69-171Google Scholar). While the N terminus of EGF (NSDSE) is quite different from the corresponding region of the heregulins, the corresponding sequence (SHFNK) in rat TGF-α is remarkably similar in composition, but does not confer on rat TGF-α affinity to the heregulin receptor. Thus while the region comprising residues 177-181 (SHLVK) of HRG is the most important element for binding specificity, additional regions are also necessary for high affinity binding, most notably, loss of the C-terminal residues at 225-226 ablated activity (Table I). The pentapeptide SHLVK (XXII) was unable to compete for HRG binding even at 170,000-fold excess (Table II), further supporting a role of multiple regions of interaction of ligand with receptor.Table I:Minimum requirements for HRG activity Open table in a new tab The solution structure of HRGα 179-225, deduced by two-dimensional NMR, indicated that residues 179-181 of the N-terminal β strand is well defined in HRG, but disordered in EGF (15Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Suzuki A. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). On the basis of this structure, Nagata et al. (15Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Suzuki A. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggested that a hydrophobic patch, including Leu179, and an ionic cluster, including Lys181, were important for specific binding of HRG. Our findings demonstrate directly that this region is important for binding to the HRG receptor. It is remarkable that substitutions of EGF sequences for HRG regions bound by conserved cysteine residues or substitution of the EGF C terminus for that of HRG have no effect on binding affinity for the HRG receptor, although there are only six sites of identity and six sites of similarity in the 38 amino acids comprising them. Several amino acids in EGF shown to be important in EGFR binding (18Carpenter G. Wahl M.I. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Peptide Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Vol. 1.

The conserved residues in the intracysteine regions of EGF and HRG together with the unique HRG N terminus are therefore the essential elements of HRG binding and the specificity for the HRG receptor is entirely generated by the HRG N terminus. The features of EGF and HRG, two growth factors that are highly specific for distinct but homologous receptors, are combined in peptide XVII, which is a potent agonist for both receptors and is therefore designated “biregulin.” This chimeric peptide may be a valuable tool for examining the physiological and pathological roles of the EGF receptor family. Our findings also suggest that it may be possible to design compounds that combine activity for the two receptors at various ratios.

Here we use chemical crosslinking to fix these intermediates for structural characterization. We describe the X-ray structures of three haemoglobins, α2β1S82β, α2β1Tm82β and α2β1,82Tm82β, which were crosslinked between the amino groups of residues βVal1 and βLys82 by 3,3′-stilbenedicarboxylic acid (S) or trimesic acid (Tm) while in the deoxy state, and saturated with carbon monoxide before crystallization. α2β1S82β, which has almost normal oxygen affinity, is completely in the R-state conformation; however, α2β1Tm82β and α2β1,82Tm82β, both of which have low oxygen affinity, have been prevented from completing their transition into the R state and display many features of a transitional intermediate. These haemoglobins therefore represent a snapshot of the nascent R state."

BSC-40 cells, having a constitutive secretory pathway, and GH4C1 cells, having a regulated secretory pathway, were used. PTH biosynthetic products in cell extracts and media were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, identified by radioimmunoassay, and unambiguously defined as either proPTH or PTH by ion-spray mass spectrometry. In both cell types, furin was the most effective in processing proPTH to PTH. In all cases only PTH was released into the medium. In addition, partially purified furin and PC1 were tested for their ability to appropriately cleave a tridecapeptide spanning the prohormone cleavage site found in proPTH. Here too furin was much more effective at cleaving at the correct site. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed that furin and preproPTH mRNA are co-expressed in the parathyroid, whereas PC1, PC2, and PC5 are not and PACE4 is expressed only at very low levels.

Its messenger RNA, in addition to encoding the mature peptide, also encodes a “pre” or signal sequence of 25 amino acids and a basic “pro” peptide of 6 amino acids (1Kemper B. Habener J.F. Mulligan R.C. Potts Jr., J.T. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 3731-3735Google Scholar). The signal sequence facilitates entry of the nascent peptide chain into the endoplasmic reticulum and following entry into the intracisternal space this peptide sequence is cleaved. ProPTH is then transported to the trans-Golgi network where the propeptide is removed followed by packaging of PTH into secretory granules (2Habener J.F. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Orci L. J.

BSC-40 cells, having a constitutive secretory pathway, and GH4C1 cells which, additionally, have a regulated secretory pathway, were used. PTH biosynthetic products were purified by HPLC and identified by mass spectroscopy. In addition, partially purified preparations of furin and PC1 were tested for their ability to appropriately cleave a 13-amino acid peptide spanning the prohormone cleavage site in proPTH. To assess which of the processing enzymes are expressed in the parathyroid, Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization were conducted on parathyroid tissue. The coinfection studies revealed that in both cells of the constitutive and regulated pathway furin was the most effective at processing proPTH to PTH. Colocalization studies showed that furin is expressed in the parathyroid whereas PC1 and PC2 are not. Moreover, hfurin processes the −6 to +7 sequence of hproPTH very efficiently in vitro. Therefore, furin is most probably the enzyme responsible for the physiological processing of proPTH to PTH. Vaccinia Virus Constructs The purified recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) used were as follows. The vaccinia virus recombinant of human proPTH (VV:hPTH) was prepared using a full-length human (h) preproPTH cDNA (15Hendy G.N. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Vaccinia Virus Infections Cells, either BSC-40, an African green monkey epithelial-like cell line, or GH4C1, a rat pituitary tumor cell line, were infected with a mixture of VV:hPTH and either VV:mPOMC (control), VV:hfurin, VV:mPC1, or VV:mPC2, as described previously (17Benjannet S. Reudelhuber T. Mercure C. Rondeau N. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11417-11423Google Scholar). After the infection period, the inoculum was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cells were incubated for 17 h at 37°C. The cells were then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.01% bovine serum albumin for 3 h after which cells and medium were harvested for further analysis. Reversed-phase High Performance Liquid Chromatography of Culture Media and Cell Extracts Reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) of culture media and cell extracts was performed using C18μ-Bondapak (Waters) and C18Vydac TP201 (Cole Parmer, Chicago) columns, as described previously (18Bennett H.P.J.

Both culture media and cell extracts were separately subjected to an initial RP-HPLC step using the μBondapak column which was eluted over 1 h with a linear gradient of 28-48% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.13% (v/v) heptafluorobutyric acid (C3F7COOH) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. This gradient was chosen since PTH and all known parathyroid cell derived fragments of PTH elute from the column under these conditions (19Bennett H.P.J. Solomon S. Goltzman D. Biochem.

We previously determined that both proPTH and PTH are recovered with 80-85% efficiency through successive RP-HPLC steps (20Rabbani S.A. Yasuda T. Bennett H.P.J. Sung W.L. Zahab D.M. Tam C.S.

Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10080-10089Google Scholar). In the present studies, culture media derived from BSC-40 and GH4C1 cells generated chromatograms in which immunoreactive PTH coincided with single peaks of UV absorbance. For these experiments fractions were dried and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis without further purification. For all cell extracts further RP-HPLC procedures were required to obtain material of sufficient purity for mass spectrometry. For these experiments fractions containing immunoreactive PTH were first subjected to RP-HPLC using the Vydac column which in each case was eluted over 1 h with a linear gradient of 8-48% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. At this stage all samples derived from BSC-40 cell extracts yielded chromatograms where PTH immunoreactivity was associated with single peaks of UV absorbance. These materials were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis. Further chromatography of material with PTH immunoreactivity derived from extracts of GH4C1 cells was required prior to mass spectrometry. In each case the PTH immunoreactivity could be resolved into two fractions which were subjected separately to RP-HPLC on the μBondapak column which was in each case eluted over 1 h with a linear gradient of 16-56% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.1% CF3COOH at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. Ion Spray Mass Spectrometry Ion spray mass spectra of purified peptides were obtained using an API III triple stage mass spectrometer (Sciex, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada). Mass estimations were done essentially as described previously (22James S. Gibbs B.F. Toney K. Bennett H.P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 84-90Google Scholar). The lyophilized peptide samples were redissolved in 10% acetic acid and infused through a stainless steel capillary (100-μm internal diameter) at a flow rate of 1 μl/min. A stream of air was introduced to assist in the formation of submicron droplets (23Covey T.R. Bonner R.F. Shushen B.I. Henion J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 1988; 2: 249-256Google Scholar). These droplets were evaporated at the interface by nitrogen gas, producing a series of multiply charged ions which are mass analyzed. Simple algorithms correlate the charges produced by peptides and proteins to their molecular weights. The mass to charge ratio (m/z) of each of these ions produces a molecular weight estimate. These estimates are averaged to give an observed mass. In Vitro Cleavage of Human ProPTH Peptide The two human endoproteases, hPC1 and hfurin, were obtained from the medium of somatomammotroph GH4C1 cells following infection with the respective recombinant vaccinia virus as described elsewhere (24Jean F. Basak A. Rondeau N. Benjannet S. Hendy G.N. Seidah N.G. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 891-900Google Scholar). The two proteases were partially purified using anion exchange chromatography prior to use and the enzymatic activity of each recombinant enzyme was assayed using the fluorogenic substrate pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA (Peptides International, Louisville, KY). The synthetic tridecapeptide (proPTH(−6-+7)), corresponding to amino acids −6 to +7 of the human proPTH molecule (with +1 designating the first amino acid of the mature 84-amino acid molecule), was kindly synthesized and purified by Drs. S. Sakakibara and T. Kimura (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan). A 100-μg sample was incubated for various time intervals with 18 μl of purified hfurin (containing an activity of 50 nmol/h of released AMC from pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA (70 μM)) at 25°C in 300 μl of 50 m M sodium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 2 m M CaCl2and 1 μM guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid (Calbiochem Corp., La Jolla, CA). Similarly, incubations were also done using 50 μl of purified hPC1 (corresponding to an activity of 50 nmol/h of released AMC from pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA (70 μM)) at 25°C in 300 μl of 50 m M sodium acetate, pH 6, containing 5 m M CaCl2and 1 μM guanidinoethylmercaptosuccinic acid. All fluorescence measurements were made with a Perkin-Elmer MPF-3L spectrofluorometer using an excitation wavelength set at 370 nm and an emission wavelength set at 460 nm in order to measure the AMC released, as described previously (25Castillo M.J. Nakajima K. Zimmerman M. Powers J.C. Biochemistry. 1979; 99: 53-64Google Scholar). Following incubation for 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 240 min, identical aliquots were taken, acidified with 50 μl of acetic acid, and analyzed on an Exsil 300A/ODS column (25 cm × 0.46 cm). The buffer system consisted of an aqueous 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH solution and an organic phase containing 0.1% (v/v) CF3COOH in acetonitrile. Elution was carried out by using a linear gradient of 1% organic phase/min following a 5-min initial isocratic step; the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The elution pattern was monitored by measuring the UV absorbance at 225 nm. The peptides detected were automatically collected and kept at −20°C until characterized by amino acid analysis as described previously (26Jean F. Basak A. Chrétien M. Lazure C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 399-406Google Scholar). In order to compare these constants between small fluorogenic peptidyl substrates and those obtained with the tridecapeptide, a fluorogenic substrate corresponding to benzylocarbonyl (Z)-Val-Lys-Lys-Arg-MCA (Enzyme System Products, Livermore, CA) was used. Incubations for determination of kinetic constants were typically carried out in the presence of various concentrations of fluorogenic peptide substrates from 20 μM to 2 m M for each enzyme in the above mentioned buffers at 25°C for 4 h before stopping the reaction by the addition of 50 μl of acetic acid. The amount of AMC released was determined by spectrofluorometry. Determination of kinetic constants for the proPTH peptide was accomplished by reversed-phase HPLC analysis followed by integration of the peak area corresponding to the released COOH-terminal fragment Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-Gln-Leu. Various concentrations of the proPTH peptide ranging from 10 μM to 400 μM were incubated in the presence of either hPC1 or hfurin in a total volume ranging from 400 to 30 μl keeping the enzyme concentration constant. Following incubation for 90 min (hPC1) or 15 min (hfurin), the amount of the released COOH-terminal fragment, Ser-Val-Ser-Glu-Ile-Gln-Leu, was determined after RP-HPLC, as described above, and by amino acid analysis. The Kmand Vmax values were determined after curve-fitting using Sigmaplot wv 1.02 software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Northern Analysis Total RNA was prepared from bovine parathyroid glands by the guanidinium isothiocyanate/cesium chloride method. Ten-microgram aliquots of RNA were electrophoresed on 1.1% agarose-formaldehyde gels, blotted onto Nylon membranes, and hybridized with random primer 32P-labeled probes as described elsewhere (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The probes used were a 2.2-kilobase SmaI- SalI restriction fragment encoding a human furin cDNA (gift of Dr. A. Rehemtulla, Genetics Institute), a 325-base pair rat PC1 cDNA corresponding to the segment 715-1039 of mPC1 (5Seidah N.G. Gaspar L. Mion P. Marcinkiewicz M. Mbikay M. Chrétien M.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 415-424Google Scholar), and a 534bp rPACE4 cDNA corresponding to the segment 1153-1687 of hPACE4 (10Kiefer M.C. Tucker J.E. Joh R. Landsberg K.E. Saltman D. Barr P.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 757-769Google Scholar). In Situ Hybridization Rat thyroids including the parathyroid glands were frozen in isopentane at −35°C. Frozen 10-μm sections were cut on a cryostat, thaw-mounted on polylysine-coated glass slides, and stored at −70°C until processed for in situ hybridization as described previously (28Day R. Schäfer M.K.H. Watson S.J. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 485-497Google Scholar). Hybridization was carried out with a digoxigenin-labeled UTP cRNA probe (PTH) or with 35S-UTP-labeled cRNA probes (prohormone convertases). Antisense cRNA probes consisted of a 430-nucleotide rat (r) PTH probe (29Heinrich G. Kronenberg H.M. Potts Jr., J.T. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3320-3329Google Scholar) kindly provided by Dr. G. Heinrich, a 590-nucleotide rat (r) PC1 probe equivalent to segment 1841-2430 in mouse (m) PC1 (6Seidah N.G. Marcinkiewicz M. Benjannet S. Gaspar L. Beaubien G. Mattei M.G. Lazure C. Mbikay M. Chrétien M. Mol.

DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 415-424Google Scholar); a 1232-nucleotide rfurin probe equivalent to segment 823-2053 in human (h) furin (4Barr P.J. Mason O.B. Landsberg K.E. Wong P.A. Kiefer M.C. Brake A.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 319-328Google Scholar); a 534-nucleotide rPACE4 probe equivalent to the segment 1153-1687 of hPACE4 (10Kiefer M.C. Tucker J.E. Joh R. Landsberg K.E. Saltman D. Barr P.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 757-769Google Scholar); and a 837 nucleotide rPC5 segment 1089-1925 (13Lusson J. Vieau D. Hamelin J. Day R. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6691-6695Google Scholar). The hybridization conditions were as follows. The cRNA probes were diluted in hybridization buffer (75% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 3 × SSC, 50 m M sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 × Denhardt's solution, 0.1 mg/ml yeast tRNA, and 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA) with the addition of 1 m M dithiothreitol. The slides were incubated for 16 h at 55°C. After hybridization the coverslips were removed and the sections were treated with RNase A (40 μg/ml) for 45 min at 37°C and then washed sequentially in 2 ×, 1 × and 0.5 × SSC for 10 min, followed by a 1-h wash in 0.1 × SSC at 60°C. After dehydration the sections were air-dried and subsequently dipped in emulsion, and exposure times ranged from 10 to 15 days. Slides to which digoxigenin-labeled UTP cRNA probe was hybridized were treated as follows. Each section was incubated 2 h with a solution of 2 × SSC, 0.05% Triton X-100, 2% normal sheep serum. The sections were washed in 100 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m M NaCl followed by a 5-h incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (diluted 1:1000 in 100 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m M NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% normal sheep serum). The sections were washed two times for 10 min each in 100 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 150 m M NaCl and once in 100 m M Tris, pH 9.5, 100 m M NaCl, 50 m M MgCl2. This was followed by an overnight incubation in chromogen solution, consisting of 45 ml of nitro blue tetrazolium (75 mg/ml in dimethylformamide), 35 ml of 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate, and 2.4 mg of levamisole per 10 ml of 100 m M Tris, pH 9.5, 100 m M NaCl, 50 m M MgCl2. Incubation was performed in humidified chambers in the dark. The chromagen reaction was stopped in 10 m M Tris, pH 8.0, 1 m M EDTA. Controls for specificity of hybridization were carried out using sense strand cRNA probes of similar length and specific activity or by pretreatment of the sections with RNase A. Purification of immunoreactive (i) PTH moieties from both cell and media extracts of BSC-40 and GH4C1 cells was readily accomplished by reversed phase RP-HPLC. On initial chromatography using an acetonitrile/C3F7COOH solvent system for both cell extracts and media of BSC-40 cells, iPTH eluted as a major peak at 38% acetonitrile (Fig. 1, A and B). This is the expected elution position of both proPTH and PTH in this system. A similar elution pattern was seen when GH4C1 cell extracts and media were purified using the same solvent system (Fig. 1, C and D). Insignificant amounts of iPTH eluted either before or after this major peak. This was observed in cells and medium for both the control (coinfection with VV:mPOMC) and experimental (coinfection with VV:hfurin, VV:mP"
https://openalex.org/W2088514516,"The Son of sevenless (Sos) protein functions as a guanine nucleotide transfer factor for Ras and interacts with the receptor tyrosine kinase Sevenless through the protein Drk, a homolog of mammalian Grb2. In vivo structure-function analysis revealed that the amino terminus of Sos was essential for its function in flies. A molecule lacking the amino terminus was a potent dominant negative. In contrast, a Sos fragment lacking the Drk binding sites was functional and its activity was dependent on the presence of the Sevenless receptor. Furthermore, membrane localization of Sos was independent of Drk. A possible role for Drk as an activator of Sos is discussed and a Drk-independent interaction between Sos and Sevenless is proposed that is likely mediated by the pleckstrin homology domain within the amino terminus."

In the present study we have found high levels of DNA ligase I and DNA ligase III activity in bovine testes and have purified DNA ligase III to near homogeneity. The high level of DNA ligase III suggests a role for this enzyme in meiotic recombination. In assays measuring the fidelity of DNA joining, we detected no significant differences between DNA ligases II and III, whereas DNA ligase I was clearly a more faithful enzyme and was particularly sensitive to 3′ mismatches. Amino acid sequences of peptides derived from DNA ligase III demonstrated that this enzyme, like DNA ligase II, is highly homologous with vaccinia DNA ligase. The absence of unambiguous differences between homologous peptides from DNA ligases II and III (10 pairs of peptides, 136 identical amino acids) indicates that these enzymes are either derived from a common precursor polypeptide or are encoded from the same gene by alternative splicing. Based on similarities in amino acid sequence and biochemical properties, we suggest that DNA ligases II and III, Drosophila DNA ligase II, and the DNA ligases encoded by the pox viruses constitute a distinct family of DNA ligases that perform specific roles in DNA repair and genetic recombination.

https://openalex.org/W1555090655,"An analysis was performed of differential splicing of primary transcripts in the noncollagenous variable region located in the amino terminus of the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) collagen chains. The results for the pro-α2(XI) chain showed that human cartilage or fibroblasts in culture contain transcripts in which a single highly acidic exon encoding for 21 amino acids is present or absent. For the chicken pro-α1(XI) chain a more complex pattern of alternative splicing was detected with six possible variants. Of special interest was the alternative use of two exons (called IIA and IIB) in which IIA encodes for 39 amino acids and is highly acidic (estimated pI = 3.2), whereas IIB encodes for 49 amino acids and is highly basic (estimated pI = 10.6). A similar alternative use of exon IIA or exon IIB was also observed for human chondrocytes. Northern blotting with probes specific for IIA or IIB showed that both exons are present in transcripts from cartilage but exon IIB is preferentially utilized in transcripts from tendon. Present results suggest that both the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) chains of type XI collagen undergo limited processing in vivo and that the noncollagenous variable region is initially retained on the surface of the fibrils. Differential splicing in the variable region may potentially influence the interaction of collagen fibrils with other molecules of the extracellular matrix and more specifically with sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains or with hyaluronan. Such interactions may play a key role in establishing both the organization of the collagen fibrils within the extracellular matrix and in limiting the diameter of collagen fibrils. An analysis was performed of differential splicing of primary transcripts in the noncollagenous variable region located in the amino terminus of the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) collagen chains. The results for the pro-α2(XI) chain showed that human cartilage or fibroblasts in culture contain transcripts in which a single highly acidic exon encoding for 21 amino acids is present or absent. For the chicken pro-α1(XI) chain a more complex pattern of alternative splicing was detected with six possible variants. Of special interest was the alternative use of two exons (called IIA and IIB) in which IIA encodes for 39 amino acids and is highly acidic (estimated pI = 3.2), whereas IIB encodes for 49 amino acids and is highly basic (estimated pI = 10.6). A similar alternative use of exon IIA or exon IIB was also observed for human chondrocytes. Northern blotting with probes specific for IIA or IIB showed that both exons are present in transcripts from cartilage but exon IIB is preferentially utilized in transcripts from tendon. Present results suggest that both the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) chains of type XI collagen undergo limited processing in vivo and that the noncollagenous variable region is initially retained on the surface of the fibrils. Differential splicing in the variable region may potentially influence the interaction of collagen fibrils with other molecules of the extracellular matrix and more specifically with sulfated glycosaminoglycan chains or with hyaluronan. Such interactions may play a key role in establishing both the organization of the collagen fibrils within the extracellular matrix and in limiting the diameter of collagen fibrils. In many tissues, such as cornea or vitreous humor, the diameter of each collagen fibril is carefully regulated (1Parry D.A.D. Craig A.S. Ruggeri A. Motta P.M. Ultrastructure of the Connective Tissue Matrix. Kluwer Academic, Boston, MA1984: 34-64Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which this is controlled is still unknown. Numerous studies have shown that most, if not all, collagen fibrils contain a small proportion of one or more members of the type V/XI family of collagens (2Fessler J.H. Fessler L.I. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 81-103Google Scholar, 3Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types.

Originally, it was thought that type XI collagen is specific for cartilaginous tissues (3Eyre D.R. Wu J.J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 261-281Google Scholar). However, other studies have demonstrated the presence of transcripts for both the pro-α1(XI) chain (7Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriguez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Google Scholar, 8Brown K.E. Lawrence R. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol.

Vuorio E.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 595-602Google Scholar, 11Dharmavaram R.M. Baldwin C.T. Reginato A.M. Jimenez S.A. Matrix. 1993; 13: 125-133Google Scholar) in a variety of cells in culture and in different tissues during development. In addition, adult bovine bone was shown to contain a significant amount of the α1(XI) chain in addition to the α1(V) chain (12Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 314-318Google Scholar). More recent results show that a molecule of chain organization α1(XI)2α2(V) is the major collagen synthesized by the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A204 (13Kleman J.P. Hartmann D. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 329-335Google Scholar). In addition, the isolation of α1(XI) and α2(V) chains, but not α2(XI) chains, from bovine vitreous (6Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Mayne P.M. Baker J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9381-9386Google Scholar), further supports the growing evidence that there is a single type V/XI family of collagens with a variety of different chain organizations (14Petit B. Freyria A.-M. van der Rest M. Herbage D. Adolphe M. Biological Regulation of the Chondrocytes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 33-83Google Scholar). It appears likely that all of the collagen molecules in this family will share a common function, and that individual members of the family may be potentially involved in the generation of tissue-specific collagen fibrils. Initially, a function for the type V/XI collagen family was suggested from in vitro experiments which demonstrated that type V collagen will limit the diameter of collagen fibrils formed from type I collagen (15Adachi E. Hayashi T. Connect. Tissue Res. 1986; 14: 257-266Google Scholar, 16Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Barbiarz J.P. Doane K.J. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 649-657Google Scholar). Similar experiments indicating an involvement of type XI in the control of fibril diameter were reported for cartilage collagens in which type II, type IX, and type XI collagen were all found to be required for the assembly of fibrils of constant diameter (17Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Burgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar). Separate evidence for an involvement of the type V/XI collagen family in influencing fibril diameter was obtained from an analysis of the cho/cho mouse which exhibits an autosomal recessive chondrodysplasia in which thick collagen fibrils are observed by electron microscopy within the cartilage matrix (18Seegmiller R. Fraser F.C. Sheldon H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 580-593Google Scholar, 19Seegmiller R. Ferguson C.C. Sheldon H. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1972; 38: 288-301Google Scholar). Recent analyses show that the cho mutation is located in the mouse α1(XI) collagen gene and that these animals have only a limited ability to synthesize the pro-α1(XI) chain (20Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Google Scholar). In addition, two Dutch families were recently analyzed each with an inherited chondrodysplasia resembling Stickler syndrome but without eye involvement. In both families mutations in the α2(XI) chain were located showing the importance of type XI collagen in the cartilagenous structures of man (21Vikkula M. Mariman E.C.M. Lui V.C.H. Zhidkova N.I. Tiller G.E. Goldring M.B. van Beersum S.E.C. de Waal Malefijt M.C. van den Hoogen F.H.J. Ropers H.-H. Mayne R. Cheah K.S.E. Olsen B.R. Warman M.L. Brunner H.G. Cell. 1995; 80: 431-437Google Scholar). A model was presented recently for the location of type V on the surface of a fibril of type I collagen present in the chicken embryonic cornea (22Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Google Scholar). It was proposed that the major collagen triple helix of type V collagen lies buried within the fibril (as was also proposed earlier (4Birk D.E. Fitch J.M. Barbiarz J.P. Linsenmayer T.F. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 999-1008Google Scholar, 23Petit B. Ronzière M.C. Hartmann D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Google Scholar)). However, the amino terminus of each molecule, including a second short collagen triple helix, was proposed to project away from the surface of the fibril. Thus, the noncollagenous amino terminus of each molecule could potentially interact with other connective tissue macromolecules such as proteoglycans, and therefore be involved in maintaining the overall organization of the matrix. The nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of the amino terminus of the human and chicken α1(V) chain (22Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J.

Hoffman G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Google Scholar), the human α2(V) chain (26Woodbury D. Benson-Chanda V. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2735-2738Google Scholar), the human and bovine α1(XI) chain (8Brown K.E. Lawrence R. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23268-23273Google Scholar, 27Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar), and the human α2(XI) chain (28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar) are all available. Analysis of these sequences shows that the pro-α2(V) chain is closely related to the chains of type I, II, and III collagen, whereas the pro-α1(V), pro-α1(XI), and pro-α2(XI) chains are closely related to each other and share several unique features (14Petit B. Freyria A.-M. van der Rest M. Herbage D. Adolphe M. Biological Regulation of the Chondrocytes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 33-83Google Scholar, 25Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol.

For the pro-α2(XI) chain, a disulfide-bonded peptide called proline/arginine-rich protein or PARP1 1The abbreviations are: PARPproline/arginine-rich proteinRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactionbpbase pairsSSCstandard sodium citrate buffer. is released from the amino terminus during extracellular processing and is subsequently retained in the cartilage matrix from which it can be isolated in significant amounts (29Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Google Scholar). The pro-α1(V) and pro-α1(XI) chains also have an amino-terminal domain which is homologous in amino acid sequence and location of cysteine residues to PARP (30Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1992; 307: 49-54Google Scholar, 31Wälchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Google Scholar, 32Moradi-Améli M. Deléage G. Geourjon C. van der Rest M. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 233-239Google Scholar; see Fig. 1). However, it is not known if there is a specific cleavage and release of these PARP-like domains into the matrix. For the pro-α1(V), pro-α1(XI), and pro-α2(XI) chains there is a highly acidic amino acid sequence which follows the basic PARP-like domains and is variable in length. This is the only region of the molecule for which little or no homology can be recognized in amino acid sequence when the α1(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) chains are compared (24Takahara K. Sato Y. Okazawa K. Okamoto N. Noda A. Yaoi Y. Kato I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13124-13129Google Scholar, 25Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol.

Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar). We have now performed a detailed analysis of transcripts containing the variable region using RT-PCR and, with additional analyses of the genomic organization, report alternative mRNA processing of the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α2(XI) chains. proline/arginine-rich protein reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction base pairs standard sodium citrate buffer. Human chondrocytes were isolated from sternal cartilage obtained from an 8-year-old white female during pectus excavatum surgery as described previously (28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar). Human skin fibroblasts were initially obtained from a skin biopsy of a 34-year-old white female and were at the fifth passage. The cells were grown in McCoy's modified 5a medium plus 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic antimycotic. Human gingival fibroblasts were obtained as outgrowths from a normal adult male and grown in minimal essential medium (α medium) plus 10% fetal calf serum, 1%L-glutamine, and 4% antibiotic/antimycotic mixture. The cells were passaged with trypsin four to six times before being utilized for RNA isolation. Human histiocytic lymphoma cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL 1593 U-937) and were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Chicken chondrocytes were obtained from the sterna of 17-day embryos and were isolated as described previously (33Brewton R.G. Ouspenskaia M.V. van der Rest M. Mayne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 443-449Google Scholar). All culture medium and supplements were from Life Technologies, Inc./BRL Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD. Chicken gizzard, heart, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, skin, lung, liver, and tendon were all dissected from 17-day embryos and used to isolate RNA without dissociation into individual cells. Total RNA from cells or tissues was obtained by the single step acid-guanidine method (34Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar) and poly(A)-rich RNA selected by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography (35Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar). Synthesis of first strand cDNA was based on a kit (Reverse Transcription System; Promega Corp., Madison, WI) using either 5 μg of poly(A)-rich RNA or 10-30 μg of total RNA in 50 μl of buffer. A mixture of random primers (10 μl) was added and the mixture incubated at 65°C (10 min) and rapidly cooled on ice (1 min). To the RNA/primer mixture, 5 μl of 100 m M methylmercuric hydroxide (Alfa/Johnson Matthey, Ward Hill, MA) was added with incubation for 10 min at room temperature followed by 5 μl of 700 m Mβ-mercaptoethanol and incubation for 5 min at room temperature. For first strand cDNA synthesis, avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was employed with incubation at 45°C for 45 min followed by 55°C for 15 min. Precipitation was performed with absolute ethanol in the presence of 3 M Na-acetate, pH 5.2 (10:1 ratio), at −20°C and the pellet washed with ice-cold ethanol (80%). Total RNA was isolated from 17-day chick chondrocytes and other chick tissues using RNAzolTMB according to the manufacturer's instructions (Biotecx Laboratories, Inc., Houston, TX). Poly(A)-rich RNA was isolated with streptavidin-paramagnetic particles using a kit (PolyATract mRNA Isolation System; Promega). First strand cDNA was prepared from chicken tissues as described above for human cells. In order to analyze the variable region of the human pro-α2(XI) chain (28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar), PCR was performed with primers DE1 (5′-514CAGAAGGAGCTGGAATGCGAG534-3′) and PO2 (5′953CGGAATGGGAGCATGAGAGA3′934) using GeneAmp PCR core reagents (Perkin Elmer, Norwalk, CT), and Taq I polymerase (Promega). The cycle parameters were 2 min denaturation (94°C), 1.5 min annealing (58°C), and 3 min polymerization (72°C) for 33 cycles with 5 min final elongation (75°C) using a Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA). For the initial PCR to analyze the variable region of the chicken pro-α2(XI), pro-α1(XI), and pro-α1(V) chains, degenerate oligonucleotides XB1 5′-GA(CT)GA(AG)GA(AG)GTITT(CT)GA(AG)GG-3′ and XB2 5′-GG(TC)TCICC(TC)TT(TC)T(GC)(TGCA)CC(TC)TT-3′ were designed from shared amino acid sequences with substitution by inosine residues at some sites in the 5′ ends of the primers (33Brewton R.G. Ouspenskaia M.V. van der Rest M. Mayne R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 443-449Google Scholar). Subsequently, the variable region of the chicken pro-α1(XI) chain was analyzed by RT-PCR with primers PL1 and PL2 located in exons I and V (see Fig. 6 for location and sequence of primers). For isolation of a human genomic α2(XI) clone, a human leukocyte genomic library constructed in EMBL 3A vector (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) was used. For screening, a 162-bp fragment was generated by PCR on the NZ2 clone derived from human chondrocyte RNA (28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar) using primers LA5 = 5′-604TCAAGACTTCACAGGCCACA623-3′ and LA6 = 5′-765TTCCAACACTGCAGGCTCTC746-3′. The 162-bp fragment was extracted from agarose gel using a QIAEX agarose gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Chatsford, CA). For screening, the 162-bp fragment was labeled using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The specific activity of labeling was ≅1 × 109cpm/μg DNA. The labeling reaction was performed with 3000 mCi/mmol [α-32P]dCTP (DuPont NEN). Two overlapping genomic clones were obtained (λHGCol18 and λHGCol9). For sequencing, the whole insert was first removed by digestion with HindIII or EcoRI/ SacI, and then subcloned from the λHGCol18 clone into pBluescript II SK+ plasmid. The constructed plasmids were called p18H15 and p18RS12 and used for DNA sequencing and analysis of genomic structure. For the isolation of chicken genomic α1(XI) clones a chicken genomic library in λFIX II vector (Stratagene) was screened with 558- and 528-bp fragments generated by PCR on plasmid DNAs containing exon IIB (called pXB28) or exon IIA (called pXB45) using primers PL1 and PL2 (see Fig. 6). Fragments were labeled using a random primed DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Two overlapping genomic clones (λCHCol5 and λCHCol13) were obtained. The whole inserts from both λ clones were subcloned into pBluescript II using the NotI restriction site. For the isolation of a human genomic α1(XI) clone containing exon IIB, a PCR procedure was conducted using total genomic DNA from human leukocytes (Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) with primers RX6 (5′-675TGCACCAGAGGATATAATCG694-3′) located in exon IIA and HT4 located in exon III (5′-866AACATGCCTAGGAGCTTCTG847-3′) as described in Ref. 27Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar. A PCR fragment (955 bp) was subcloned into PCRTMII vector using the TA cloning system (Invitrogen Corp., San Diego, CA) for DNA sequencing. To isolate cDNA for human IIB exon, RT-PCR was performed on human chondrocyte RNA with primers LA1 (5′-652AGGAACCTCAGATAGATAG671-3′) located in exon I, and VC5 (5′-811AAATCATCAACGATGTTTGC792-3′) located in exon III (27Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar). Two PCR products were obtained which after subcloning into the PCRTMII vector and DNA sequencing were shown to contain exon IIA or exon IIB. PCR was performed on plasmid DNAs pXB28 and pXB45 which contain the exon sequences I-IIA-III-IV-V and I-IIB-III-IV-V with sets of primers VS4 (5′-TACACACCAGAAGATTTTAT-3′) and VS5 (5′-CTCTGTTTGTGCTATTGTCT-3′) designed to amplify specifically exon IIA and VC1 (5′-AAAAAGAAAGCCATGGTCAA-3′) and VC2 (5′-CCCTAGTTTGTCTCTTGTTG-3′) designed to amplify specifically exon IIB (see Fig. 6 for location of primers). The PCR products were subcloned into PCRTMII vector and the correct sequences were confirmed. To obtain biotinylated probes for Northern hybridization, unidirectional PCR was performed using the antisense primer VS5 for IIA and VC2 for IIB and a mixture of dNTPS in which dUTP was biotinylated (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Each template (0.2 mg) was primed with 5 × 10−6 M of antisense primer in the presence of 0.5 units of Taq I polymerase (Promega) in reaction buffer with 2.5 m M MgCl2with cycle parameters of denaturation (95°C, 2 min), annealing (54°C, 1 min), polymerization (72°C, 3 min) for 40 cycles with a final elongation (75°C, 5 min). Biotinylated single stranded probes were precipitated with absolute ethanol in the presence of 3 M NaAc, and boiled prior to hybridization. Total RNA (20 μg/lane) was isolated from 17-day embryonic chicken brain, kidney, gizzard, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, lung, skin, tendon and isolated chondrocytes before being run on a 1% agarose-formamide gel. Transfer was to maximum strength NYTRAN membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH) prehybridized in 5 × SSC (1 × SCC = 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 0.8% SDS with 100 μg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega) at 65°C for 2 h. After washing, membranes were hybridized with single stranded biotinylated exon IIA or exon IIB probes in the same solution as above at 65°C. Filters were washed twice for 30 min with 2 × SSC, 0.1 SDS at 65°C and once for 15 min in 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C. Biotinylated signals were detected with a PolarPlex Chemiluminescent kit (Millipore). All sequencing was performed on both strands with Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). All plasmid templates for sequencing were isolated using the WizardTMminipreps DNA purification system (Promega). Previously, we reported (28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar) the molecular cloning of human PARP from hyaline cartilage and the subsequent biosynthesis by RT-PCR of a 1.86-kilobase pair product which bridged from PARP to the published nucleotide sequence of the human pro-α2(XI) chain (36Kimura T. Cheah K.S.E. Chan S.D.H. Lui V.C.H. Mattei M-G. van der Rest M. Ono K. Solomon E. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13910-13916Google Scholar). The PCR product was cloned and the complete nucleotide sequence determined. Analysis of this sequence showed that it included a variable region which was found to be much shorter than the variable region of the pro-α1(XI) and pro-α1(V) chains (Fig. 1). During these experiments, it was found on nucleotide sequencing of individual DNA molecules cloned from the RT-PCR reaction that a short stretch of 63 nucleotides was missing in some clones. The nucleotide-derived amino acid sequence of this stretch was found to be highly acidic (DPTPGEEEEILESSLLPPLEE) and was located in the variable region of the human pro-α2(XI) chain (nucleotides 646-708; Ref. 28Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar). This initial observation suggested that differential splicing of the primary transcript may occur in the variable region. Accordingly, RT-PCR reactions were performed with 20-21-mer oligonucleotides which directly span the variable region and using RNA preparations obtained from a variety of human cells in culture. Fig. 2 compares the products of RT-PCR reactions performed for human chondrocytes (lane 1) and for human skin fibroblasts (lane 2). In both cases, two major products were observed which were cloned into the PCRTMII vector using the TA cloning protocol and shown to differ by the expected 63 nucleotides. The same two products were also obtained in varying proportions for human gingival fibroblasts in culture and for a line of human histiocytic lymphoma cells. Small amounts of other products were sometimes observed by RT-PCR (for example, a band of approximately 7-800 nucleotides for human skin fibroblasts; Fig. 2, lane 2) but were not investigated further. It is possible that additional alternatively spliced forms of the pro-α2(XI) chain may also be synthesized during the RT-PCR reaction since two additional exons have recently been identified in transcripts from several mouse tissues but not from mouse cartilage (37Tsumaki N. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2372-2378Google Scholar, 38Vandenberg P. Prockop D.J. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 415Google Scholar). Genomic clones coding for the variable region of the pro-α2(XI) chain were obtained by screening a human leukocyte library (EMBL 3A) with a 162-bp fragment prepared by PCR using nested primers (LA5 and LA6) on the NZ2 plasmid as a template so that the 63-bp sequence was included. Two overlapping λ genomic clones were obtained (called λHGCol18 and λHGCol9) and the whole inserts from each clone were subcloned into plasmid pBluescript II SK+ vector for DNA sequencing. The genomic organization was determined by DNA sequencing reactions performed with primers synthesized from the known cDNA sequence and by PCR reactions using primers which spanned one or more exons. Fig. 3 shows that the 63-bp sequence arises from a single exon which is located between two large introns. In addition, the location of five additional exons was determined for the human pro-α2(XI) chain (Fig. 3) and a short stretch of the nucleotide sequence at each intron/exon boundary is shown in Fig. 4. All introns showed canonical sequences for intron/exon junctions.Figure 4:Nucleotide sequences at intronlexon junctions of genomic clones for the human pro-α2(X1) collagen chain.

Examination of the published sequences for the pro-α1(V), pro-α1(XI), and pro-α2(XI) chains showed the presence of two short stretches of amino acids which span the variable region and are highly conserved for all three chains. One sequence DEEVFEG is located in the “PARP-like” domain of chicken pro-α1(V) (amino acid positions 210-216; Ref. 22Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E.

This suggested that it may be possible to amplify the variable region of these three chains of the type V/XI family by a single RT-PCR reaction using degenerate oligonucleotides designed from these amino acid sequences. Fig. 5 A shows that numerous bands were obtained when an RT-PCR reaction was performed on 17-day embryonic chicken cartilage RNA using a sense primer 5′-GA(CT)GA(AG)GA(AG)GTITT(CT)GA(AG)GG-3′ and an antisense primer 5′-GG(TC)TCICC(TC)TT(TC)T(GC)(TGCA)CC(TC)TT-3′ in which some positions were substituted with inosine residues (33Brewton R.G.

Each band was cloned into the PCRTMII vector and the complete nucleotide sequence determined for several of these clones.

To gain insights into the function of this polypeptide, we have disrupted its gene in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii with an aadA expression cassette that confers resistance to spectinomycin through biolistic transformation. The transformants are still able to grow photoautotrophically in dim light, but not in high light, and they remain photosensitive when grown on acetate containing medium. The amounts of photosystem II complex and oxygen evolving activity are both reduced to 10-20% of wild-type levels in these psbI-deficient mutants. It appears that the PsbI polypeptide plays a role in the stability of photosystem II and possibly also in modulating electron transport or energy transfer in this complex.

The photosystem II (PSII)1 1The abbreviations used are: PSIIphotosystem IIHSMhigh salt minimalkbkilobase(s). complex within the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts catalyzes the light-driven reduction of plastoquinone with electrons from water (for review see Refs. 1Andersson B. Styring S. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 1-81Google Scholar, 2Vermaas W. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 457-481Google Scholar). Although this complex includes over 20 polypeptides, it has been possible to isolate a reaction center complex capable of performing in vitro the primary electron transfer reactions of PSII (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Google Scholar, 4Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 99-104Google Scholar, 5Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Google Scholar). This minimal complex contains only five polypeptides, namely D1, D2, the α and β subunits of cytochrome b559, and the PsbI polypeptide, which are all encoded by the chloroplast genome (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Google Scholar, 4Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 99-104Google Scholar, 5Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Google Scholar). The D1 and D2 proteins bind all the redox components of PSII required to transfer electrons from the manganese cluster of the water splitting complex to the plastoquinone pool (1Andersson B. Styring S. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 1-81Google Scholar, 2Vermaas W. Ann. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 457-481Google Scholar). These include P680, the primary electron donor, pheophytin, the primary electron acceptor, and QA and QB, the first and second quinone acceptors. D1 also provides the electron donor to P680, Z, and together with D2 is thought to bind the manganese cluster involved in water oxidation. The function of cytochrome b559 is not clear although it has been proposed that it may catalyze a cyclic electron flow around PSII that serves to protect the PSII reaction center against photodamage (6Thompson L.K. Brudvig G.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 6653-6658Google Scholar, 7Telfer A. He W.-Z. Barber J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 143-151Google Scholar). The sequence of the 4.8-kDa PsbI polypeptide has been determined in several plants and cyanobacteria and found to be highly conserved (for review see Ref. 8Erickson J.E. Rochaix J.D. Barber J. The Photosystems: Structure, Function and Molecular Biology. Elsevier Science Publishers-B. V, New York1992: 101-176Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies indicate that the N terminal part of the psbI gene product is in close contact with the D2 protein and the α subunit of cytochrome b559 on the stromal side of the thylakoid membrane (9Tomo T. Enami I. Satoh K. FEBS Lett. 1993; 323: 15-18Google Scholar). However, the function of the PsbI polypeptide within the PSII reaction center complex is not yet known. To obtain insight into the role of this polypeptide, we have inactivated the psbI gene of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through directed chloroplast gene disruption via biolistic transformation, and we have examined the properties of the psbI-deficient transformants. photosystem II high salt minimal kilobase(s). C. reinhardtii wild-type strain 137c and the chloroplast PSII mutant FuD7 in which the psbA genes have been deleted (10Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delosme M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Google Scholar) were used. The PSII mutant X was isolated during this study. The growth media Tris acetate-phosphate (TAP) and high salt minimal (HSM) were prepared as described (11Rochaix J.D. Mayfield S.P. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Erickson J. Shaw C.H. Plant Molecular Biology: A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1988: 253-275Google Scholar). The transformants were either grown on TAP plates or in TAP liquid medium containing 100 and 25 μg/ml spectinomycin, respectively. The larger 2.6-kb PstI- EcoRI fragment of the chloroplast DNA fragment R7 of C. reinhardtii (12Rochaix J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 126: 597-617Google Scholar) was cloned in the Bluescribe plasmid. The second NsiI site was removed after partial digestion with NsiI, blunting, and religation giving rise to the pBSR7pt2.6 plasmid (see Fig. 2). The plasmid pUC-atpX-aad containing the atpA- aadA cassette (13Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Google Scholar) was cut with EcoRV and SmaI, and the excised cassette was inserted into pBSR7pt2.6 after cutting with ScaI and NsiI and blunting, thus removing the psbI gene (Fig. 2). The orientation of the cassette was determined by digestion with PstI (13Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4083-4089Google Scholar). The plasmid with aadA in the same orientation as atpA was called pBS R7pt2.6aad1 (Fig. 2). The psbD- aadA cassette was excised from the cg12 plasmid (25Nickelsen J. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3182-3191Google Scholar) with BamHI and blunted, and ClaI (partial digestion) and inserted into pBSR7pt2.6aad1 which had been cut with SpeI and blunted, and with ClaI (partial digestion). Recombinant DNA plasmids for transformation were prepared using standard methods (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Chloroplast transformation in C. reinhardtii wild-type cells was performed as described previously (15Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S.-Y. Franzen L.G. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Google Scholar) selecting for resistance to spectinomycin. Five transformants named 7-2, 10-1, 10-2, 14-1, and 14-2 were characterized. Total DNA and RNA were isolated as described (10Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delosme M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Google Scholar). The 0.24-9.5-kb RNA ladder from Life Technologies, Inc. was used for determining the size of transcripts. Antibody against the D1 protein was a gift from L. McIntosh. Total cell proteins were separated by electrophoresis, electroblotted on nitrocellulose membranes, reacted with antibodies, and visualized by the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) method (Amersham) as described by the manufacturer. These measurements were performed as described (15Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Soen S.-Y. Franzen L.G. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2033-2040Google Scholar, 16Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Google Scholar). Fluorescence transients and Fv/Fmax values were determined with the Plant Efficiency Analyzer of Hansatech Instruments. The chloroplast DNA region of C. reinhardtii comprising psbI was sequenced earlier (17Leu S. Schlesinger J. Michaels A. Shavit N. Plant Mol. Biol. 1992; 18: 613-616Google Scholar) and the gene identified recently (18Boudreau E. Otis C. Turmel M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 585-602Google Scholar). We localized this gene independently on the chloroplast EcoRI fragment R7 using a psbI probe from tobacco for DNA hybridization (data not shown). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the PsbI polypeptide of C. reinhardtii reveals significant sequence identities with its homologue from higher plants (76%), cyanobacteria (65%), and Euglena gracilis (57%) (Fig. 1). The C. reinhardtii PsbI protein contains 37 amino acids, 1 residue more than in plants. A highly conserved segment of 21 predominantly hydrophobic amino acids could represent a transmembrane domain. Another conserved feature is the presence of several charged residues near the carboxyl terminus. The physical map of the chloroplast DNA region of C. reinhardtii comprising psbI is shown in Fig. 2. A plasmid containing the 2.6-kb PstI- EcoRI fragment was digested with ScaI and NsiI to remove the psbI gene. The deleted region was replaced with the aadA expression cassette conferring resistance to spectinomycin in which the coding region of aadA is flanked by a chloroplast promoter and 5′-untranslated region (from either atpA or psbD) and the 3′ downstream region of rbcL (Fig. 2; 13, 25). The constructs were introduced into the chloroplast genome through biolistic transformation selecting for resistance to spectinomycin. Analysis of transformants obtained with the cassette containing the atpA 5′ region in the same orientation as atpA revealed a 2-kb deletion comprising the atpA gene (data not shown) presumably due to recombination between the two 5′ atpA regions located 1 kb apart (Fig. 2). Since insertion of this cassette in the opposite orientation could have resulted in a deletion between the two 3′- rbcL regions, we used a cassette containing the psbD promoter and 5′-untranslated region and chose transformants with the orientation shown in Fig. 2. The DNA from five transformants was isolated, digested with EcoRI, and hybridized with an R7 probe (Fig. 3). It can be seen that while the probe hybridizes as expected to the 3.6-kb R7 fragment in wild-type and in the photosystem II mutant Fud7 (lane F), it hybridizes to a 5.1-kb fragment in all five transformants examined as predicted from the plasmid used for transformation (Fig. 2). The aadA probe hybridizes to the same fragment of the transformants, but not to the DNA of untransformed strains (Fig. 3). Since the chloroplast genome is polyploid we tested the transformants for homoplasmicity. No signal corresponding to the wild-type R7 fragment was detectable in the transformants under conditions where a single copy of fragment R7/chloroplast was detected (data not shown). Hybridization of a psbI probe to total RNA from wild-type and the Fud7 mutant revealed a O.3-kb transcript that was absent as expected in all transformants examined (Fig. 4). PSII activity of the transformants was determined by measuring oxygen evolution and fluorescence transients. As shown in Table I, all transformants evolved oxygen at 10-20% of wild-type levels. It can also be seen that the ratio between variable fluorescence and maximum fluorescence, Fv/ Fmax, is significantly reduced in the transformants. To test whether the diminished PSII activity of the transformants was due to reduced accumulation of active PSII complex, cell proteins were fractionated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted, and reacted with an antibody against the D1 reaction center protein. Fig. 5 reveals that the amount of D1 protein accumulated in the transformants ranges between 10 and 20% as compared to wild-type. As expected the D1 protein is completely absent in the Fud7 mutant in which the psbA genes have been deleted (10Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delosme M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that the amount of D1 protein provides a measure of the amounts of the other PSII core subunits and that in the absence of D1 the PSII complex is unstable (10Bennoun P. Spierer-Herz M. Erickson J. Girard-Bascou J. Pierre Y. Delosme M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1986; 6: 151-160Google Scholar, 26Kuchka M. Mayfield S.P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 319-324Google Scholar). In contrast, the PsaF protein from PSI accumulates to the same level as in wild-type (Fig. 5) indicating that absence of the PsbI product affects specifically the accumulation of PSII subunits.Table I:Photosynthetic activity of the psbI::aadA mutants Open table in a new tab Wild-type and the five transformants were grown on TAP (acetate) or HSM (minimal) plates and incubated at increasing light intensities (20, 60, 600 μE m−2s−1). As shown in Fig. 6, the transformants grew under low light on HSM plates. Growth of these cells was markedly diminished at 60 μE m−2s−1and completely blocked at 600 μE m−2s−1on both HSM and TAP medium. As expected Fud7 and another PSII deficient strain, X, did not grow on HSM medium. Whereas in higher plants the psbI gene is cotranscribed with psbK, in C. reinhardtii these two genes are far apart on the chloroplast genome. This observation confirms that the relative arrangement of most chloroplast genes differs considerably between C. reinhardtii and plants. Since psbI has the same orientation as atpA located upstream, these two genes could be cotranscribed and the polycistronic transcript rapidly processed to give rise to the mature 0.3-kb psbI transcript. Alternatively, psbI could be transcribed from its own promoter. The PsbI protein of C. reinhardtii contains one additional amino acid relative to plants but displays otherwise a high amino acid sequence identity with its plant homologue (Fig. 1). The protein contains a hydrophobic stretch, which most likely represents a transmembrane domain. Together with the PsbA, PsbD, PsbE, and PsbF products, the PsbI protein is part of the PSII reaction center (3Nanba O. Satoh K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 109-112Google Scholar, 4Ikeuchi M. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1988; 241: 99-104Google Scholar, 5Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J. Gray J.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 259-262Google Scholar). It has been shown that in C. reinhardtii and cyanobacteria loss of any of the first four subunits leads to the complete inactivation of the PSII complex (1Andersson B. Styring S. Curr. Top. Bioenerg. 1991; 16: 1-81Google Scholar, 26Kuchka M. Mayfield S.P. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 319-324Google Scholar, 27Pakrasi H. De Ciechi P. Whitmarsh J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1619-1627Google Scholar). In contrast to these results, this study has revealed that the PSII complex is only partially inactivated in the psbI-deficient transformants of C. reinhardtii. In these cells both accumulation of the PSII core subunits and PSII activity are reduced to the same level, 10-20% of the wild-type values. These observations suggest that the PsbI product is involved, at least partially, in the stability of the PSII complex. We cannot rule out, however, that this subunit plays in addition also a role in modulating electron transport or energy transfer in this complex. The psbI-deficient transformants are still able to grow in minimal medium under low light. In contrast, psbK-deficient mutants of C. reinhardtii are unable to do so, and they accumulate less than 10% of PSII complex (16Takahashi Y. Matsumoto H. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 779-788Google Scholar). Since it has been shown that in cyanobacteria loss of psbK does not affect phototrophic growth and PSII function (28Ikeuchi M. Eggers B. Shen G. Webber A. Yu J. Hirano A. Inoue Y. Vermaas W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11111-11115Google Scholar) it is likely that in C. reinhardtii the PsbK protein is also not involved in the photochemistry of PSII and that this subunit, as the PsbI product, plays a role in PSII stability. These observations suggest that the threshold level of PSII in C. reinhardtii for growth on minimal medium is around 10% of wild-type level. The PsbI subunit also appears to play some role in light sensitivity, as the psbI-deficient transformants are significantly more sensitive to high light than wild-type when grown photoautotrophically or mixotrophically on acetate medium. Absence of another small hydrophobic protein associated with PSII, the Ycf8 product, also leads to impaired cell growth in high light (29Monod C. Takahashi Y. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Rochaix J.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2749-2754Google Scholar). Like the Ycf8 protein, the PsbI product could be required for maintaining normal PSII activity under stressfull high light conditions. We thank N. Roggli for drawings and photography, Dr. M. Sugiura for the tobacco psbI probe, and M. Goldschmidt-Clermont and K. Redding for helpful comments."

Here we show, using human premyeloid TF-1 cells, that IL4 stimulates JAK3 to a larger extent than JAK1, based upon three different evaluation criteria. These include a more vigorous tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK3 as measured by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting, a more marked activation of JAK3 as determined by in vitro tyrosine kinase assays and a more manifest presence of JAK3 in activated IL4- receptor complexes. These observations suggest that IL4 receptor signal transduction does not depend on equimolar heterodimerization of JAK1 and JAK3 following IL4-induced heterodimerization of IL4Rα and IL2Rγ. Indeed, when human IL4Rα was stably expressed in mouse BA/F3 cells, robust IL4-induced proliferation and JAK3 activation occurred without detectable involvement of JAK1, JAK2, or TYK2. The present study suggests that JAK1 plays a subordinate role in IL4 receptor signaling, and that in certain cells exclusive JAK3 activation may mediate IL4-induced cell growth. Moreover, mutational analysis of human IL4Rα showed that a membrane-proximal cytoplasmic region was critical for JAK3 activation, while the I4R motif was not, which is compatible with a role of JAK3 upstream of the recruitment of the insulin receptor substrate-1/4PS signaling proteins by IL4 receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2075488484,"Type XI collagen is an integral, although minor component of cartilage collagen fibrils. We have established that alternative exon usage is a mechanism for increasing structural diversity within the amino-terminal non-triple helical domain of the pro-α1(XI) collagen gene. cDNA clones spanning the amino-terminal domain were selected from a rat chondrosarcoma library, and were shown to contain two major sequence differences from the previously reported human sequence. The first difference was the replacement of sequence encoding an acidic domain of 39 amino acids in length by a sequence encoding a 51-amino acid basic domain with a predicted pI of 11.9. The second difference was the absence of a sequence that would translate into a highly acidic 85amino acid sequence downstream from the first variation. These two changes, expressed together, result in the replacement of most of the acidic domain with one that is smaller and basic. These two sequence differences serve to identify subdomains of a variable region, designated V1 and V2, respectively. V1a is defined as the acidic 39-amino acid sequence element and V1b is defined as the 51-amino acid basic sequence. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that both V1a and V1b are encoded by separate adjacent exons in the rat genome and V2 is also encoded in a single exon downstream. Analysis of mRNA from cartilage-derived sources revealed a complex pattern of α1(XI) transcript expression due to differential exon usage. In non-cartilage sources, the pattern is less complex; the most prevalent form is the one containing the two acidic sequences, V1a and V2.

The second difference was the absence of a sequence that would translate into a highly acidic 85amino acid sequence downstream from the first variation. These two changes, expressed together, result in the replacement of most of the acidic domain with one that is smaller and basic. These two sequence differences serve to identify subdomains of a variable region, designated V1 and V2, respectively. V1a is defined as the acidic 39-amino acid sequence element and V1b is defined as the 51-amino acid basic sequence. Analysis of genomic DNA revealed that both V1a and V1b are encoded by separate adjacent exons in the rat genome and V2 is also encoded in a single exon downstream. Analysis of mRNA from cartilage-derived sources revealed a complex pattern of α1(XI) transcript expression due to differential exon usage. In non-cartilage sources, the pattern is less complex; the most prevalent form is the one containing the two acidic sequences, V1a and V2. The fibrillar collagens, types I, II, III, V, and XI, combine to form the heterotypic interstitial collagen fibrils common to most tissues (1Burgeson R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 551-577Google Scholar, 2Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Google Scholar). These collagens are related by sequence homology and genomic organization; the defining features of this family of collagens include a major uninterrupted triple-helical domain, flanked by propeptide domains (1Burgeson R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 551-577Google Scholar, 3Kuhn K. Burgeson R.E. Mayne R. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 1-42Google Scholar, 4Ramirez F.

Academic Press, New York1990: 1-56Google Scholar). In cartilage, the bulk of the fibril is composed of type II collagen while type XI contributes a relatively small amount to the mass of the fibril (6Eyre D. Wu J.-J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 81-103Google Scholar). In a similar way, non-cartilaginous fibrils are mixtures of types I and V or I, III and V, with type I the major component (1Burgeson R.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 551-577Google Scholar). The overall sequence and structural similarity among these collagen types can mask specific structural differences which can vary from the subtle to the dramatic. The carboxyl propeptides of collagens are thought to guide the molecular associations leading to formation of a specific subset of possible trimeric molecules from the mixture of fibrillar collagen chains synthesized by the cell; this specificity is likely to be imparted by structural variations among these homologous domains (7Lees J.F. Bulleid N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24354-24360Google Scholar). The type XI heterotrimer is a particularly complex example of this chain selectivity. It is composed of three distinct gene products (α1, α2, and α3), where α3(XI) is the same gene product as the α1(II) chain of type II collagen homotrimers (8Morris N.P. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Google Scholar, 9Burgeson R.E. Hollister D.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res Commun. 1979; 87: 1124-1131Google Scholar, 10Furuto D.K. Miller E.J. Arch. Biochem.

In addition, type V/XI hybrid molecules, with different combinations of the component chains, have been inferred or directly demonstrated in bone (12Niyibizi C. Eyre D.R. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 314-318Google Scholar), mature articular cartilage (6Eyre D. Wu J.-J. Mayne R. Burgeson R.E. Structure and Function of Collagen Types. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1987: 81-103Google Scholar), vitreous (13Mayne R. Brewton R.G. Mayne P.M. Baker J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9381-9386Google Scholar), and in the molecule formed by the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line A204 (14Kleman J.-P. Hartmann D.J. Ramirez F. van der Rest M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 210: 329-335Google Scholar). Structural differences have also been observed in the triple-helical domain. Despite a primary structure which does not significantly differ in the overall distribution of key stabilizing amino acids such as proline and hydroxyproline, only collagens V and XI show a complex melting behavior with several stable unfolding intermediates (15Morris N.P. Watt S.L. Davis J.M. Bachinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10081-10087Google Scholar, 16Bächinger H.P. Davis J.M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 152-156Google Scholar). The greatest diversity lies in the amino propeptide where dramatic variations in sequence as well as the site and rate of proteolytic processing are observed. The amino propeptides of all of the fibrillar collagen chains contain a minor triple helix separated from the major triple helix by the amino telopeptide. The region of diversity is found between the minor helix and the signal peptide (4Ramirez F. Boast S. D'Alessio M. Lee B. Prince J. Su M.-W. Vissing H. Yoshioka H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 580: 74-80Google Scholar, 5Sandell L.J. Boyd C.D. Sandell L.J. Boy C.D. Extracellular Matrix Genes. Academic Press, New York1990: 1-56Google Scholar). In the case of α1(I), α1(III), and α2(V), a cystine-rich globular domain comprises most this region (<100 amino acids) and this sequence is lacking in the gene for α2(I). This domain is also found in the gene for α1(II) where it is encoded by exon 2 and is conditionally expressed in a developmentally regulated fashion (17Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Google Scholar, 18Sandell L.J. Morris N.P. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1307-1319Google Scholar, 19Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dynamics. 1994; 199: 129-140Google Scholar). A quite different domain is found in the analogous position in the other fibrillar collagen chains, including α1(V), α1(XI), and α2(XI) (20Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Google Scholar, 21Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Google Scholar, 22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar, 23Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R.

Here the globular domain is much larger (>400 amino acids) and more closely related to the amino-terminal noncollagenous domains of the fibril-associated collagens, types IX, XII, and XIV (25Walchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H. Trueb B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 483-490Google Scholar). The sequence contains only four cysteine residues and can be divided into a weakly basic amino-terminal half containing the cysteine residues (designated PARP-like after the pro-α2(XI) cleaved domain (23Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar, 24Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Google Scholar)) and a very acidic half adjacent to the minor helix (see Fig. 1). In cartilage, the structure of this domain in type XI collagen has been of interest because unlike type II collagen, proteolytic processing of the amino-terminal domain is very slow and even after processing is completed, some portion of the domain is retained (26Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Google Scholar). The site(s) of proteolytic cleavage have not been identified. For the pro-α1(XI) chain, it is likely that some molecules with an intact amino-terminal domain are incorporated into the growing fibril. One function of the amino propeptides of fibrillar collagens appears to be an involvement in the process of fibril formation (27Chapman J.A. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1367-1382Google Scholar). In vitro, varying the content of pN-collagen1 1The abbreviations used are: pN-collagenan intermediate in the proteolytic processing of procollagen retaining an amino propeptide but lacking the carboxyl propeptidePCRpolymerase chain reactionRCSSwarm rat chondrosarcomaIRCimmortalized fetal rat chondrocytesPARPproline/arginine-rich proteinbpbase pair(s). modulates fibrillogensis (28Holmes D.F.

Chem. 1991; 266: 12703-12709Google Scholar). In vivo, failure to remove the amino propeptide of type I collagen can result in derangement of the tightly packed cylindrical fibril as seen in dermatosporaxis (28Holmes D.F. Watson R.B. Steinmann B. Kadler K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15758-15765Google Scholar, 30Piérard G.E. La T. Hermanns J.-F. Nusgans B.V. Lapiere C.M. Collagen Rel. Res. 1986; 6: 481-492Google Scholar). The low abundance of type XI collagen, the size of the amino propeptides of type XI collagen, their persistence in the tissue, and the location of the triple helix in the interior of the cartilage fibril suggest that the role of this molecule in fibril formation is more regulatory than structural. Such a role was proposed recently for type V collagen, see also Ref. 21. an intermediate in the proteolytic processing of procollagen retaining an amino propeptide but lacking the carboxyl propeptide polymerase chain reaction Swarm rat chondrosarcoma immortalized fetal rat chondrocytes proline/arginine-rich protein base pair(s). The pro-α1(XI) amino propeptide was originally cloned and sequenced from a noncartilaginous source (22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar). Because the type XI amino propeptide may help regulate formation of collagen fibrils in cartilage, we have cloned and sequenced this domain from a cartilaginous source, rat chondrosarcoma (31Smith B.D. Martin G.R. Miller E.J. Dorfman A. Swarm R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 166: 181-186Google Scholar), and looked for structural features specific to this tissue. Our results show that alternative splicing at two sites within the acidic sequence generates multiple forms of the amino-terminal domain. The additional isoforms generated by alternative splicing are quite different from the original noncartilaginous form and, in rat, are more prevalent in cartilage. cDNA clones encoding the amino-terminal domain of rat pro-α1(XI) were obtained by serial screening of an RCS cDNA library. The library was generated from Swarm rat chondrosarcoma poly(A)+ RNA (prepared as described previously (32Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassell J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Google Scholar)), primed for first strand synthesis using both random hexamers and oligo(dT). A modified Gubler and Hoffman (33Gubler U. Hoffman B.J. Gene (Amst). 1983; 25: 263-269Google Scholar) method of cDNA construction was used employing kit reagents (Amersham). Double stranded cDNA with EcoRI linkers was ligated to λgt11 arms and phage were packaged with commercial extracts (Stratagene). The initial screen utilized a probe obtained by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of a fragment of the rat pro-α1(XI) carboxyl propeptide (34Bernard M. Yoshioka H. Rodriguez E. van der Rest M. Kimura T. Ninomiya Y. Olsen B.R. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17159-17166Google Scholar) from RCS RNA. Primers for amplification were 5′-GGAGAAGTCATACAGCCATTACCT-3′ and 5′-CCAAGAAAACAAGCTGGACCAACTTC-3′, and the amplified fragment was cloned and sequenced. DNA fragments were labeled for use as probes with 32P by random primer extension (Multiprime, Amersham). The 5′-most clone was identified by sequencing of subclones and a new probe from the 5′ end prepared by PCR amplification template DNA with primers 5′-TGAGTCCTTGAGGGCCCCC-3′ and TAGCCCTGAGTCCTTGAGG-3′. A second round of screening produced clone R1-1 (Fig. 1) identified as the 5′-most by sequencing of the purified phage. A third screen was performed in the same way using a probe generated by PCR with primers 5′-GTGTGGAGAAGAAAACTGTGACAATG and 5′-GTCACAGTCGGGACTGTAATGGTC-3′ and R1-1 template DNA. Phage containing the 5′-most cDNA were identified as those yielding the largest products of amplification between the downstream primer used to make the probe and a primer from either side of the λgt11 cloning site. Overlapping clones spanning the amino-terminal domain of rat pro-α1(XI) (see Fig. 1) were subcloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) and sequenced on both strands. Plasmids were prepared using the alkaline lysis method (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and purified using DNA Purification Resin (Promega). Sequencing was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method (36Sanger F. Nicklin S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Google Scholar) using either Sequenase DNA polymerase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) or sequencing grade Taq DNA polymerase and thermal cycle DNA sequencing protocol (fmol, Promega). In some cases, sequences were obtained by automated DNA sequencing using an ABI-373A sequencer (Perkin Elmer). Sequence alignments were performed using programs provided by the Genetics Computer Group (37Genetics Computer GroupProgram Manual for the GCG Package, Version 7, April 1991. Genetics Computer Group Inc., Madison, WI1991Google Scholar). A rat genomic DNA library (Clontech) was screened with the ApaI/ EcoRI restriction fragment from clone R1-1 (Fig. 1). Positive plaques were purified and phage DNA grown and prepared as described (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). EcoRI fragments were screened for exons by Southern hybridization analysis with oligonucleotides from C1, V1b, V2, and C3. Exon-containing fragments were subcloned into pBluescript and sequenced. A probe for V1b was prepared by PCR amplification of cloned template DNA between primers 5′-AAAAGAAATCCAATTACACAAAGA-3′ and 5′-GACCCCTAGTTTGGCTTTG-3′. Rat chondrosarcoma poly(A)+RNA was probed by Northern analysis as described previously (11Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Horton Jr., W.E. Morris N.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 28-36Google Scholar). RNA was extracted from specified tissues of 17-day fetal rat, from a fetal rat skin cell line (FR) (ATCC), and from IRC cells (provided by Walter E. Horton Jr. (38Horton Jr., W.E. Rapp C.J. Nemuth U. Bolander M. Doege K.J. Yamada Y. Hassell J.R. Exp. Cell Res. 1988; 178: 457-468Google Scholar)), by the method of Chomczynski (39Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Primer pairs for PCR bracketing variable region V1 were 5′-CCAAGGCAGCATATGACTACTGTG-3′ and 5′-GCCGAGGAGACTCAGTCTGG-3′ (C1-C2), bracketing variable region V2 were 5′-CCAGACTGAGTCTCCTCGGC-3′ and 5′-CATTCCGGGTTCAACTACAGC-3′ (C2-C3), and bracketing both V1 and V2 were 5′-CCAAGGCAGCATATGACTACTGTG-3′ and 5′-CATTCCGGGTTCAACTACAGC-3′ (C1-C3). Primer pairs for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-GTCAACGGATTTGGCCGTATTGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGTTGTCATGGATGACCTTGGCC-3′ (40Tso J.Y. Sun X.-H. Kao T.-H. Reece K.S. Wu R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2485-2502Google Scholar), were used as a control for PCR. Annealing temperatures were calculated by the PRIMER program (kindly provided by Drs. S. Lincoln, M. Daly, and E. Lander, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Center for Genome Research). PCR was performed according to established protocols (41Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar) using 1.5 m M MgCl2 in the amplification buffer and 30 cycles of amplification. As a negative control, reverse transcriptase was omitted. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 3.5% Nusieve 3:1 agarose gels (FMC) and staining with ethidium bromide. Individual amplification products were identified by direct sequencing of gel bands (fmol, Promega) after removal of agarose (PCR clean up resin, Promega). To analyze PCR products without heteroduplex formation, amplification products were end labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) and polynucleotide kinase (Promega) and electrophoresed on alkaline denaturing gels (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Electrophoretic markers, FC 174/ HaeIII digest (Promega), were labeled in the same way. Screening of the rat chondrosarcoma cDNA library led to the identification of several overlapping clones encoding the amino-terminal domain of pro-α1(XI) and some of the 5′-untranslated region (Fig. 1). The sequence from the signal peptide to the start of the major triple-helical domain is presented in Fig. 2. This corresponds to the sequence of clone R6D. In general, the rat amino-terminal domain was very similar to the reported human sequence. The sequence 5′ of the central pair of cysteine residues at nucleotides 703 and 724 of the rat sequence showed 87% nucleic acid sequence identity, translating to 93% amino acid similarity. The region of the minor helix and amino telopeptide (nucleotides 1276 to 1615 of the rat sequence) showed 87% identity at the nucleic acid level and 98% similarity at the amino acid level. Between these two regions of high homology lies an area of variability. Two major differences between rat and human were observed in this variable region. Variable region 1 (V1), starting at nucleotide 775 (shaded area in Fig. 2) was unrelated to the human sequence. Variable region 2 (V2) is the region 93 bases downstream, between 1021 and 1275 (second shaded area in Fig. 2) which was missing in clones R8E, R6B, and R1-1. Inspection of the rat and human deduced amino acid sequence showed that the very acidic (theoretical pI of 3.34) human sequence of 39 amino acids (22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar) termed V1a was replaced in RCS by a very basic (pI of 11.90) 51-amino acid sequence termed V1b. Northern analysis of RCS poly(A)+RNA (data not shown) indicated that this sequence was well represented among RCS pro-α1(XI) transcripts. In RCS, the replacement of V1a by V1b, combined with the frequent absence of V2, which also encodes a very acidic sequence, would be predicted to strikingly alter the biochemical nature of this region of the amino-terminal domain. To examine the basis for the differences between the rat and human sequences, a rat genomic library was screened with a cDNA probe specific for this region, the ApaI- EcoRI fragment of cDNA clone R1-1 (Fig. 1). Two non-overlapping genomic clones were obtained and exons were identified and analyzed by sequencing. Sequence data revealed that the V1a domain was also present in the rat gene (Fig. 3). V1a, V1b, C2 (constant region 2), and V2 each occur as separate exons, in this order (Fig. 4). The intron-exon boundaries of the four exons analyzed conform to the consensus splice acceptor and donor sites (42Sharp P.A. Cell. 1981; 23: 643-646Google Scholar) and do not involve split codons.Figure 4:Exon structure across the variable region of the amino-terminal domain. Sequence from genomic clones is summarized here. VIa , Vlb, C2, and V2 are encoded by separate exons. Exonstructure within CI and C3 was not determined, and CI an d C3 are used to indicate positions in the sequence and are not necessarily single exons. The size of each exon is indicated in base pairs (bp) and with respect to the number of amino acids encoded (nc), An additional exon, denoted p600, contains sequence up stream from but not contiguous with VIa. Sequence of intron-exon boundaries are shown. Intron sequence is shown in lower case letters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The identification of the exons and the differences observed within the rat cDNA sequences and between rat and human forms of α1(XI) pointed to alternative splicing of mRNA as the likely mechanism to generate this diversity. The pattern of exon utilization in various tissues was examined in cDNAs encoding these regions which were amplified by PCR and analyzed by electrophoresis and sequencing. IRC cell, RCS, and 17-day fetal rat sternal cartilage and limb cartilage were used as sources of chondrocyte RNA; placenta and a fetal rat skin cell line were used as sources of noncartilaginous RNA. The V1 region was amplified using primers within the C1 and C2 sequences (Fig. 5 A). Three products which correspond to the presence of V1b (319 bp), the presence of V1a (282 bp), and to the absence of a V1 exon (166 bp) were detected. The identity of these bands was verified by sequencing. All three forms were observed in normal chondrocytes, whereas RCS lacked V1a and IRC lacked V1b. The band just above 319 bp in the IRC lane as well as the uppermost band in RCS are heteroduplexes of the lower two bands. In placenta and skin fibroblasts, only V1a was detected. In only one case was a transcript containing both V1a and V1b observed. Amplification using primers within V1a and C2 (Fig. 5 C) resulted in a larger than expected band only in RCS and this band proved to be V1a + V1b as identified by sequencing. Because V1a is itself rarely expressed in RCS, PCR priming within V1a selects for rare transcripts. Analysis of the region including V2 by amplification between C2 and C3 is shown in Fig. 5B. In all cartilage-derived sources, both splice forms with (364 bp) and without (109 bp) V2 were present. The V2 domain was relatively more abundant in IRC and less so in RCS when compared to normal cartilage. In placenta and skin fibroblasts, only the form with V2 was expressed. The possibility of coordinate expression of exons from the two domains was examined by PCR amplification across both V1 and V2 using primers in C1 and C3 (Fig. 6 A). A combination of three possibilities with respect to V1 and two for V2 should yield six possible products for this amplification. Six products of the expected sizes were observed as well as additional bands of sizes not predicted from this combination of exons. A simpler picture was obtained when the PCR products were end-labeled and separated on a denaturing alkaline gel (Fig. 6 B), indicating that part of the apparent complexity could be explained by heteroduplex formation between the various products of amplification in cases where more than one product was formed. Only the products expected for combinations of V1 and V2 are present. V0, the splice form lacking both V1 and V2, is well represented in all four chondrocyte-derived RNAs. The form V1a alone is present in IRC but only barely detectable in sterna and limb. V1b was present in normal chondrocytes and RCS but was not observed in IRC. V2 alone and V1a + V2 were found in limb, sterna, and IRC but not in RCS. V1b + V2 was present in low amounts in limb, sterna, and RCS but was absent from IRC. Placenta and skin fibroblasts show only V1a + V2, the form originally cloned and sequenced (22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar). The examination of the pattern of alternative splicing of the variable region was extended to RNA samples from several other noncartilaginous tissues of fetal rat (Fig. 7). Amplification of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was performed on an identical aliquot as a control for the quantity and quality of the RNA to permit a rough estimation of the relative amount of pro-α1(XI) transcript in each tissue. Brain, calvaria, skeletal muscle, and skin showed significant expression of pro-α1(XI) mRNA. In each case, the splice form containing V1a + V2 was the prominent species. The splice form lacking both V1 and V2, V0, was also present in calvaria and skeletal muscle as was a low level of +V1b (not visible on this gel). The other tissues, heart, liver, kidney, and lung showed barely detectable levels of pro-α1(XI) transcripts and then only the V1a + V2 splice form was visible. Amplification of sternal RNA revealed the same complex pattern of alternative splicing identified above. In all of the PCR amplification experiments presented, no products were amplified when reverse transcriptase was omitted. Alternative exon splicing is now observed to be a relatively common feature of the biosynthesis of extracellular matrix macromolecules including fibronectin, elastin, aggrecan, and some of the collagens (reviewed by Boyd et al. (43Boyd C.D. Pierce R.A. Scharzbauer J.E. Doege K.J. Sandell L.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 457-469Google Scholar)) and more recently in fibrillin (44Corson G.M. Chalberg S.C. Dietz H.C. Charbonneau N.L. Sakai L.Y. Genomics. 1993; 17: 476-484Google Scholar), fibulin 1 (45Pan T.-C. Kluge M. Zhang R.-Z. Mayer U. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 733-740Google Scholar), and fibulin 2 (46Zhang R.-Z. Pan T.-C. Zhang Z.-Y. Mattei M.-G. Timpl R. Chu M.-L. Genomics. 1994; 22: 425-430Google Scholar), for example. It is clear from such studies that alternative exon splicing can have important functional consequences. Alternative splicing within the exon encoding the V region of fibronectin regulates several properties of the protein (43Boyd C.D. Pierce R.A. Scharzbauer J.E. Doege K.J. Sandell L.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 457-469Google Scholar). The portion of this exon retained in the fibronectin dimer influences fibronectin secretion from the cell, cell type-specific adhesion, and incorporation of fibronectin into fibrin clots. Within the collagen gene family, alternative splicing can involve triple-helical domains, such as in type XIII, but more generally involves nontriple-helical domains which has been shown for type VI (43Boyd C.D. Pierce R.A. Scharzbauer J.E. Doege K.J. Sandell L.J. Matrix. 1993; 13: 457-469Google Scholar) and which has been proposed for types XII and XIV (25Walchli C. Trueb J. Kessler B. Winterhalter K.H.

Recently it was shown that among the fibrillar collagens, the α1(II) gene product can be modulated by alternative splicing of exon 2 which encodes the cysteine-rich domain located between the minor helix and the signal peptide in the amino propeptide (17Ryan M.C. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10334-10339Google Scholar, 18Sandell L.J. Morris N.P. Robbins J.R. Goldring M.B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1307-1319Google Scholar, 19Sandell L.J. Nalin A.M. Reife R.A. Dev. Dynamics. 1994; 199: 129-140Google Scholar). In the absence of direct evidence, functional significance is inferred from the pattern and location of the alternative spliced exons within the mRNA and protein, specific tissue distribution, or specific spatial and temporal pattern of expression during development. Data presented in this report demonstrate that the rat α1(XI) chain undergoes a complex pattern of alternative exon usage involving two closely associated variable regions, V1 and V2, located between the PARP-like region and the minor helix of the amino-terminal domain. This region, identified from a noncartilaginous source, is highly acidic with a predicted pI of 3.34 (22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar). Transcripts from cartilage, analyzed by PCR, indicate that these two variable regions can generate six forms of the amino-terminal domain. These forms arise because in V1 either the V1a exon, or the V1b exon or both can be spliced out while the V2 exon can be either present or absent. These splice isoforms are also observed in RNA from human and chick chondrocyte.2Splicing of these exons is coordinated since V1a and V1b are typically expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion; furthermore, V1b expression is usually linked to the absence of V2, V1a to the presence of V2. The V1b exon encodes a very basic amino acid sequence, predicted pI of 11.9, while V1a and V2 are quite acidic. The combinations of these exons observed would produce four prevalent versions of the variable segment of the amino-terminal domain: a basic form, V1b + C2, strongly acidic forms, V1a + C2 + V2 or C2 + V2, and a smaller less acidic form consisting of C2 alone (Fig. 8), designated Vo. The V0 isoform would most closely resemble the structure of the α2(XI) amino-terminal domain (23Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar). Since C2 is also an acidic sequence and is constitutively expressed, the differences of net charge described among the isoforms are a matter of degree. While it is simplistic to categorize sequences based solely on net charge, the differences are striking enough to be noted. Embryonic noncartilaginous tissues have been shown to express mRNA transcripts of the α1(XI) gene (48Nah H.-D. Barembaum M. Upholt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22581-22586Google Scholar). Northern analysis of poly(A)+RNA with a probe including the carboxyl propeptide coding region showed that chick brain, skin, calvaria, heart, and muscle express transcripts of the α1(XI) collagen gene. Examination of α1(XI) mRNA isoforms in several different rat embryo tissues by PCR showed a similar distribution with the exception of heart. While it is difficult to assess abundance by PCR, use of a standard transcript amplified in parallel provides some basis for comparison. Several other tissues showed negligible levels of α1(XI) transcripts while yielding comparable levels of amplification of transcripts of the housekeeping gene, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The correlation of these PCR results with the results from Northern analysis suggests that detection of α1(XI) transcripts in these noncartilaginous tissues is not a trivial result of the extreme sensitivity of PCR. These same tissues also express low levels (relative to cartilage) of α1(II) (49Nah H.-D. Upholt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23446-23452Google Scholar) and α2(XI) mRNA (50Sandberg M.M. Hirvonen H.E. Elima K.J.M. Vuorio E.I. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 595-602Google Scholar). Expression of α1(XI) in these noncartilaginous tissues also shows a degree of specificity. The acidic form, V1a + C2 + V2, is prominent in the type XI-positive tissues, consistent with the splice form of the amino-terminal domain initially cloned and sequenced in human placenta and other sources (22Yoshioka H. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6423-6426Google Scholar). Rat placenta also expresses this form primarily. Skin and calvaria may also express small amounts of V1b + C2 and V0. Northern analysis using total RNA, conditions selective for more abundant transcripts, indicates that the α1(XI) gene is transcribed more extensively only in cartilage and tendon (58Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Google Scholar). Surprisingly, splice forms with V1b but not V1a were detected in tendon. Within cartilage, all six isoforms of the amino-terminal domain are represented. Relative abundance cannot be determined accurately by PCR. However, end labeling and analysis on denaturing alkaline gels represents each isoform on a molar rather than mass basis so that the observation of large differences in signal may be relevant. Significant among the isoforms are the basic version, V1b + C2, and Vo. It is not known if a single chondrocyte expressing α1(XI) synthesizes all of these forms or whether splice patterns correlate with degree of differentiation or some other aspect of chondrocyte biology. In this regard, it is interesting to note that the two transformed chondrocytes examined, RCS and IRC, each express a subset of the isoforms. IRC cells synthesize only the Vo and the acidic forms, while RCS cells synthesize predominantly Vo and the basic form. This could reflect some developmental or inherent property of chondrocytes or it may just reflect an aberration resulting from transformation. At the protein level, we have previously observed multiple electrophoretic forms of pro-α1(XI) synthesized by metabolically labeled chick sternal chondrocytes (26Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Google Scholar) and IRC cells (11Oxford J.T. Doege K.J. Horton Jr., W.E. Morris N.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 28-36Google Scholar). It is likely that these may represent different splicing isoforms, although this has yet to be demonstrated. The 51-amino acid peptide encoded by the V1b exon is a unique sequence based on comparison to the sequence data base. The sequence is unusual in that a majority of the basic residues (mostly lysines) are found in clusters of three, four, or five residues. Such clusters might serve as sites for proteolysis and generate a more readily processed form of the α1(XI) amino-terminal domain. In some cases the clusters are separated by four or six amino acids in which case they fit the putative hyaluronan binding motif, B(X7)B, of Yang et al. (51Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Google Scholar), where B represents a basic amino acid and X denotes any non-acidic amino acid. In addition to the alternative splicing reported here for the α1(XI) chain, essentially the same regions of the α2 (XI)2and α3(XI) (i.e. α1(II)) undergo alternative splicing events. The sequence of the variable region of α1(XI) is unrelated to the analogous region of α1(V) while the remainder of the two chains is very homologous. The sequence of this region of α1(V) also shows significant species or tissue-dependent variation (20Greenspan D.S. Cheng W. Hoffman G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24727-24733Google Scholar, 21Linsenmayer T.F. Gibney E. Igoe F. Gordon M.K. Fitch J.M. Fessler L.I. Birk D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1181-1189Google Scholar), although no evidence of alternative exon usage in this region has been reported. Fetal and growth plate cartilage collagen fibrils are relatively small in diameter, less than 25 nm. As a minor but integral component of these fibrils (2Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Google Scholar, 52Petit B. Ronzier M.C. Hartmann D.J. Herbage D. Histochemistry. 1993; 100: 231-239Google Scholar), type XI collagen has been proposed as an element involved in the regulation of fibril diameter. Evidence for this function includes: very slow proteolytic processing within the pro-α1(XI) amino-terminal domain (26Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7262-7269Google Scholar) whose large size would not likely be accommodated within the fibril; limitation of cartilage fibril diameter when fibrils were reconstituted with the matrix form of type XI (53Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar); demonstration by immunoelectron microscopy of the PARP-like domain at the surface of thin but not thick fibrils in cartilage growth plates (54Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 289aGoogle Scholar); and finally, failure of the homozygous recessive chondrodystrophic mouse (CHO) to synthesize the α1(XI) chain (55Li Y. Lacerda D.A. Warman M. Beier D. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Taylor B. Seegmiller R. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Google Scholar), resulting in cartilage which contains unusually large fibrils and fails to retain proteogylcans effectively (56Seegmiller R. Fraser F.C. Sheldon H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 580-593Google Scholar, 57Seegmiller R. Ferguson C.C. Sheldon H. J. Ultrastruct. Res. 1972; 38: 288-301Google Scholar). Based on structural data, the proteolytic processing site(s) likely resides between the PARP-like domain and the minor helix (23Zhidkova N.I. Brewton R.G. Mayne R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 326: 25-28Google Scholar, 24Neame P.J. Young C.N. Treep J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20401-20408Google Scholar, 27Chapman J.A. Biopolymers. 1989; 28: 1367-1382Google Scholar). This is precisely the location of the variable region, portions of which could be retained after processing. The PARP-like domains and the variable regions could mediate interactions directly or indirectly between the proteoglycan network and the collagen fibrils. The alternatively spliced exons, V1b, V1a, and V2 could influence fibril formation and interactions by modulating processing of the PARP-like domain or, independent of processing, could, in themselves, provide sites for interaction with the cartilage matrix.

Such effects are mediated via the binding of NGF to the TrkA surface receptor which has a tyrosine kinase activity that is stimulated by NGF binding (3Klein R. Jing S. Narduri V. O'Rourke E. Barbacid M. Cell. 1991; 65: 189-197Google Scholar, 4Barbacid M. Lamballe F. Pulido D. Klein R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 115-127Google Scholar).

The analysis of such changes in gene expression has been greatly aided by the availability of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line (5Greene L.A. Tischler S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Google Scholar) which responds to NGF by differentiation to a sympathetic neuron-like phenotype (for review, see Ref. 6Greene L. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Google Scholar). Studies using these cells have defined a number of genes whose transcription is activated by NGF. These include those encoding transcription factors such as c- fos (7Greenberg M.E. Greene L.A. Ziff E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14101-14110Google Scholar, 8Millbrandt J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4789-4793Google Scholar) and NGFIA (9Millbrandt J. Science. 1987; 238: 797-799Google Scholar) and NGFIB (10Millbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Google Scholar), which are induced rapidly and transiently, as well as others such as those encoding tyrosine hydroxylase (11Gizang-Ginsberg E. Ziff E.B. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 477-491Google Scholar) and peripherin (12Leonard D.G.B. Ziff E.B. Greene L.A. ( Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3156-3167Google Scholar) which are induced more slowly. Evidently insights obtained in this immortalized cell line need to be confirmed in the appropriate primary neurons. The inability of sympathetic or embryonic dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons to survive in the absence of NGF (13Johnson E.M. Gorin P.M. Brandeis L.D. Pearson J. Science. 1980; 210: 916-918Google Scholar) has rendered this difficult however. It has been possible however to confirm some of the insights obtained with PC12 cells using cultures of adult DRG neurons which are responsive to NGF but do not require it for survival (14Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2394-2405Google Scholar, 15Winter G. Forbes A. Sternberg J. Lindsay R.M. Neuron. 1988; 1: 973-981Google Scholar). Thus these cells respond to NGF by inducing expression of the mRNA encoding c-Fos (16Lindsay R.M. Shooter E.M. Radeke M.J. Misko T.P. Dechant G. Thoener H. Lindholm D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1990; 2: 389-396Google Scholar) as well as those encoding NGFIA and IB (17Kendall G. Ensor E. Brar-Rai A. Winter J. Latchman D.S. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 25: 73-79Google Scholar). These cells also show elevated levels of the neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in response to NGF (18Lindsay R.M. Harmar A.J. Nature. 1989; 337: 362-364Google Scholar). Interestingly, however, our recent experiments suggest that although the CGRP gene promoter can be activated by NGF in both DRG and PC12 cells, the mechanisms mediating this effect are different in the two cell types (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Thus by modifying a procedure used by others for chick neurons (20Gabellini N. Minozzi M.-C. Leon A. Dal Toro R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 131-138Google Scholar), we were able to successfully transfect adult rat DRG neurons using a calcium phosphate procedure. This allowed us to show that the induction of the CGRP promoter in DRG cells requires only sequences located from −140 upstream of the transcriptional start site to +8 downstream (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). In contrast in PC12 cells a construct containing this region is not inducible, and induction requires in addition sequences located between −1670 and −140 (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The 149-base pair element in the CGRP promoter thus offers the opportunity to dissect an NGF-responsive region which is specifically active in primary DRG neurons. Here we show that the NGF inducibility mediated by this region in DRG neurons is dependent upon a cyclic AMP response element (CRE) within it. However, this CRE alone is not sufficient to mediate a response to NGF when separated from other sequences in this region, although it can produce a response to cyclic AMP in these circumstances. Cultures were prepared from adult Wistar rats. Spinal ganglia were removed aseptically, digested with 0.3% collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 90 min, then mechanically dissociated through a 1-ml Gilson tip. Cells were plated for at least 2 h in the absence of NGF on polyornithine-coated 35-mm tissue culture Petri dishes. Lightly adherent neurons were separated from more adherent non-neuronal cells using a stream of medium from a 1-ml Gilson pipette. To further purify the neurons they were then pelleted at 120 g through fetal calf serum. Neurons were replated in the absence of NGF onto 35-mm tissue culture Petri dishes coated with poly- L-lysine at a density of 105cells/dish and grown in F-14 medium with 4% Ultraser G (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 mg/ml streptomycin and 100 units/ml penicillin in the presence of the mitotic inhibitor cytosine arabinoside at 10 μM. Cells for histochemical staining were grown in 10 mm Lab-Tec Chamber slides (Nunc) at a density of 1000 cells/well. When appropriate either 2.5 S NGF (Promega) to a final concentration of 5 ng/ml or dibutyryl cyclic AMP to 50 μM was added to the cultures. At least 8 h after plating the neuronally enriched cultures, DNA transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate procedure with 10 μg/ml plasmid DNA essentially as described by Gorman (21Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Vol. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) and Gabellini et al. (20Gabellini N. Minozzi M.-C. Leon A. Dal Toro R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 131-138Google Scholar), but with the following modifications (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Transfection was performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml polyornithine for 7 h followed by a 30% Me2SO shock for 4 min at room temperature (22Dong Y. Stioultchi A.I. Pollard J.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21 (771): 771Google Scholar). Cells were left for 36 h after transfection before the addition of NGF then left for a further 48 h before harvesting. Neuronal cell networks free from residual non-neuronal cells were removed from the poly- L-lysine as described in the cell culture section and assayed for CAT activity. PC12 cells were transfected in the absence of polyornithine and were not subjected to a Me2SO shock. NGF was added immediately after transfection. The calgcat 4 plasmid (see Fig. 3a) contains 140 bases of the 5′-upstream region of the human calcitonin/CGRP gene together with the first 8 bases of exon 1 fused to the CAT gene (23Symes A.J. Craig R.K. Brickell P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 229-233Google Scholar). Calgcat 9 (Fig. 3 a) was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of calgcat 3 (23Symes A.J. Craig R.K. Brickell P.M.

The 68-base pair fragment containing the CGRP promoter from −140 to −72 was then removed using BamHI- Sau3A and cloned into the BamHI site of pBLCAT2 (24Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). Calgcat 10 (Fig. 3 a) was made by polymerase chain reaction amplification of calgcat 3 (23Symes A.J. Craig R.K. Brickell P.M. FEBS Lett. 1992; 306: 229-233Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotide primers 5′ primer (TAGGATCCGACCCCTCCGCCCATTGGTT) and 3′ primer (TACTGCAGTCTCTGATGCCTCCCAGCGC); the amplified fragment was cloned into the T Vector plasmid (Promega) and sequenced. The 97-base pair fragment containing the CGRP promoter from −88 to +9 was then ligated into BamHI- PstI-digested GCATG (25Frebourg T. Brison O. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 315-318Google Scholar). The CRE in calgcat 4 was mutated to TGGAGCA using the pAlter vector (Promega). Mutated bases are underlined. All constructs were sequenced using the Sequenase kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Assays of CAT activity were carried out as described by Gorman (21Gorman C.M. Glover D.M. DNA Cloning: A Practical Approach. Vol. 2. IRL Press, Oxford1985: 143-190Google Scholar) with extracts which were equalized for protein content, as determined by the method of Bradford (26Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar). The values of CAT activity obtained in this way were subsequently equalized for differences in the efficiency of plasmid DNA uptake between samples as determined by dot blot hybridization of the DNA in an aliquot of the cell extract using a probe derived from the CAT gene (27Abken H. Reifenrath B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3527Google Scholar). DRG neurons were treated with 5 ng/ml NGF for 24 h or left untreated. Cells were then fixed in methanol and then stained with anti-phospho-CREB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Ltd.) using a rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). In our previous experiments (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) we used calcium phosphate-mediated transfection to show that a construct (calgcat 4) containing the region of the CGRP gene from −140 to +9 relative to the transcriptional start site contains all the sequences required to mediate NGF inducibility in adult DRG neurons. To delineate the elements required further, another construct calgcat 10 containing sequences from −88 to +8 was prepared. When transfected into DRG neurons, this construct showed no statistically significant difference in activity in the presence or absence of NGF, although it did give a basal activity above the background level of the parental GCATG vector (25Frebourg T. Brison O. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 65: 315-318Google Scholar) which lacks any promoter element driving the CAT gene (Fig. 1). Hence the sequences mediating NGF inducibility must lie, at least in part, between −140 and −88, although sequences downstream of −88 constitute a functional promoter. We therefore prepared a construct containing the sequence of the CGRP promoter from −140 to −72 so as to include this upstream region together with any regulatory elements which might span the −88 end point of calgcat 10. As this upstream fragment will evidently lack the CGRP basal promoter, its effect was tested by cloning it at position −105 upstream of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in the pBL CAT 2 vector (24Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar). This construct, calgcat 9 showed a statistically significant increase in activity in the presence of NGF (p = 0.05), although its basal activity was similar to the pBL CAT 2 vector (Fig. 2). As the parental pBL CAT 2 vector is not affected by NGF, this indicates that the region from −140 to −72 constitutes an NGF-inducible enhancer element which mediates the activation of the CGRP promoter by NGF and which can also act on a heterologous promoter to render it NGF-inducible. Inspection of the DNA sequence of this region revealed a sequence at −103 to −109 showing a close relationship to the consensus sequence of a cyclic AMP response element (Fig. 3, CRE) which mediates gene activation in cells treated with cyclic AMP (28Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Google Scholar). In agreement with this, both calgcat 9 (Fig. 4) and calgcat 4 (Fig. 5 a) showed a statistically significant increase in activity upon treatment of DRG neurons with 50 μM dibutyryl cyclic AMP (p = 0.05 for calgcat 9 and p = 0.01 for calgcat 4). In order to test the role of the CRE in mediating the response to NGF, we used site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate it by altering two central bases (Fig. 3) within the context of calgcat 4. This mutation rendered the construct nonresponsive to both cyclic AMP (Fig. 5 a) and NGF (Fig. 5 b) with no statistically significant change in activity being observed following either of these treatments. However, as expected from our previous work (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) the parental calgcat 4 construct was clearly inducible by NGF (Fig. 5 b, p = 0.01) as well as by cyclic AMP. Hence the CRE motif in the CGRP promoter is required not only for its response to cyclic AMP but also for its NGF inducibility.Figure 5:CAT assay of DRG neuronal cultures transfected with calgcat 4 containing CGRP promoter sequences from −140 to +8 or the same construct in which 2 bases in the CRE have been mutated as indicated in Fig. 3. a shows the results of treatment with cyclic AMP and b of treatment with NGF. In each case, values are expressed relative to the activity obtained with calgcat 4 in unstimulated cells and are the average of three determinations whose standard deviation is shown by the bars.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To extend these observations we investigated whether the CRE from the CGRP promoter could mediate cyclic AMP and NGF inducibility when isolated from the other sequences between −140 to −72. An 18-base pair oligonucleotide derived from CGRP promoter sequences and consisting of the CRE and 6 flanking bases on either side was therefore cloned into the same site at −105 in the thymidine kinase promoter used to clone the −140 to −72 fragment. A statistically significant increase in activity of this construct was observed following cyclic AMP treatment (Fig. 6 a, p = 0.05). Hence the isolated CGRP CRE is able to confer cyclic AMP inducibility on the thymidine kinase promoter in agreement with previous results using the CRE motifs from other promoters (29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar). In contrast this motif is not sufficient to confer responsiveness to NGF on the thymidine kinase promoter with no statistically significant increase in activity of the construct being observed following NGF treatment (Fig. 6 b). Hence this motif is necessary and sufficient for the response to cyclic AMP and is necessary but not sufficient for the NGF response. It is known that cyclic AMP activates transcription through the CRE by phosphorylating the CREB transcription factor on serine 133 (29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar). This stimulates the activity of the CREB transcriptional activation domain allowing DNA-bound CREB to activate transcription (30Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Google Scholar). To test whether NGF also stimulated phosphorylation of CREB, we used an antibody which specifically recognizes CREB only when it is phosphorylated on serine 133. In these experiments this antibody detected phosphorylated CREB in DRG neurons that had been treated with NGF for 24 h but not in cultures maintained in the absence of NGF (Fig. 7). Hence the necessity for an intact CRE to allow an NGF response in the CGRP promoter is likely to be dependent on the ability of NGF to induce phosphorylation of CREB. Moreover the inability of the isolated CRE to mediate the NGF response in the absence of other sequences is not explained by the absence of appropriately phosphorylated CREB in NGF-treated cells. The minimal NGF-inducible CGRP promoter (−140 to +8) which we defined in our previous work (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar) contains both a CRE at −103 to −109 and an element related to the consensus binding site for the heat shock transcription factor which is located between −58 to −45 relative to the transcriptional start site. Although a similar heat shock element-like sequence has been suggested to mediate the NGF inducibility of the substance P gene in PC12 cells (31Gilchrist C.A. Morrison C.F. Chapman K.E. Harmar A.J. DNA Cell Biol. 1991; 10: 743-749Google Scholar, 32Gilchrist C.A. Morrison C.F. Harmar A.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1395-1400Google Scholar), we find no evidence that the related element in the CGRP promoter is involved in its NGF inducibility. Thus, this heat shock element-like sequence cannot confer NGF inducibility when linked to the thymidine kinase promoter,2 2A. Watson and D. Latchman, unpublished data. whereas the calgcat 9 construct consisting of sequences from −88 to +8 contains this element and is not NGF inducible. Rather the NGF inducibility of the CGRP promoter is dependent upon the CRE and is associated with the NGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB on serine 133. Although the phosphorylation of CREB at this position also occurs in response to cyclic AMP (28Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17359-17362Google Scholar, 29Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Google Scholar, 30Yamamoto K.K. Gonzalez G.A. Biggs W.H. Montminy M.R. Nature. 1988; 334: 494-498Google Scholar), the isolated CRE is not sufficient to mediate the NGF response whereas it can confer responsiveness to cyclic AMP. This difference may be related to other post-translational changes in CREB which occur in response to cyclic AMP but not NGF or vice versa. Thus, for example, it has been shown that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type II phosphorylates CREB on serine 133 and serine 142 and does not activate transcription via a CRE, whereas calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV phosphorylates only on serine 133 and activates transcription (33Sun P. Enslen H. Myung P.S. Maurer R.A. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 2527-2539Google Scholar). It is also possible, however, that this effect is related to differences in the modulation of other non DNA binding accessory molecules which interact with CREB and are required for transcriptional activation. Thus the CREB-binding protein binds specifically to phosphorylated CREB (34Chriva J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Google Scholar) and is itself activated in response to cyclic AMP (35Kwok R.P.S. Lundblad J.R. Chriva J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G.E. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Google Scholar). It is possible therefore that following NGF treatment this or other changes in accessory factors do not occur and that promoter activation therefore requires not only CREB but also another DNA-binding protein which binds in the region from −140 to −72 but not to the 18-base pair element containing the CRE. A similar situation occurs in the response of the NGFI-A promoter to treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-3. Thus although the CRE in the promoter is required for activation by these factors, it is not itself sufficient, and induction also required an adjacent serum response element (36Sakamoto K.M. Fraser J.K. Lee H.-J.J. Lehman E. Gasson J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5975-5985Google Scholar). Interestingly the CRE in the c- fos promoter has also been shown to be necessary but not sufficient for an NGF response, whereas NGF treatment of these cells has been shown to result in CREB phosphorylation on serine 133 by a novel Ras-dependent kinase (37Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Google Scholar). In this case also promoter activation requires an adjacent serum response element in addition to the CRE binding site for phosphorylated CREB (37Ginty D.D. Bonni A. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 713-725Google Scholar), indicating that serum response element-binding protein(s) such as the serum response factor cooperate with phosphorylated CREB to produce the response. These considerations support a model in which induction of the CGRP promoter in response to NGF requires both phosphorylated CREB and another factor binding to an adjacent site within the −140 to −72 region. This region does not contain any serum response elements, suggesting that another factor modulated by NGF is involved in this case. Indeed this would be predicted from the fact that, unlike the c- fos promoter, the minimal CGRP promoter in calgcat 4 is not induced by NGF in PC12 cells (19Watson A. Ensor E. Symes A. Winter J. Kendall G. Latchman D. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). Hence the second factor binding to the −140 to −72 region is likely to be DRG-specific in either its activation or response to NGF. This would account for the requirement in PC12 cells for a region further upstream for NGF inducibility if this upstream region bound an NGF-modulated factor which was present in PC12 cells and could cooperate with CREB. These considerations focus attention on the nature of the second factor which binds to the −140 to −72 region. We are currently carrying out DNA mobility shift assays to identify proteins other that CREB which bind in this region as well as deletion mapping the region to identify the minimal sequence which can produce NGF inducibility. Whatever the precise identity of this factor, our studies indicate the necessity to confirm results obtained in PC12 cells using primary neuronal material, since there are clear dissimilarities as well as similarities between the regulatory pathways in the two cell types. Moreover, they identify the CRE in the CGRP promoter as being necessary but not sufficient for NGF inducibility, although it is both necessary and sufficient for inducibility by cyclic AMP. We thank Giles Kendall, Aviva Symes, Janet Winter, and John Wood for helpful discussions."

Members of the TAM-based receptor family are typically coupled to two subfamilies of PTKs. The FcεR1 associates with the src-family tyrosine kinase p56lyn and a 72-kDa PTK, Syk (3Eiseman E.

The BCR is similarily associated with p56lyn (13Yamanashi Y. Kakiuchi T. Mizuguchi J. Yamamoto T. Toyoshima K. Science. 1991; 251: 192-194Google Scholar) and Syk whereas the TCR is predominantly associated with the src-family p59fyn and a kinase homologous to Syk, ZAP70 (14Samelson L.E. Phillips A.F.

One common response to triggering of the FcεR1, TCR, and BCR is tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (2Park D.J. Min H.K. Rhee S.G. J. Biol.

A second, essential, PTK-controlled signaling pathway to originate from the TCR involves the guanine nucleotide-binding proteins p21ras (23Izquierdo M. Downward J. Graves J.D. Cantrell D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3305-3312Google Scholar). The mechanism of TCR coupling to p21ras was proposed to involve the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos, the homologue of the Drosophila “son of sevenless” gene product (24Bowtell D. Fu P. Simon M. Senior P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6511-6518Google Scholar, 25Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar). Sos is known to complex with the adapter protein Grb2/Sem 5 which is composed of one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains (26Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A.

In many cell systems, the SH3 domains of Grb2 bind to Sos whereas the interaction between the Grb2 SH2 domain and tyrosine-phosphorylated molecules such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor or Shc may regulate the function and cell localization of Sos (27Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 28Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A.

Studies in T lymphocytes have identifed a number of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins which can potentially bind to Grb2. These include Shc, a membrane-localized tyrosine phosphoprotein of 36-kDa and 75- and 116-kDa molecules (25Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 31Ravichandran K.S. Lee K.K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Burn P. Burakoff S.J. Science. 1993; 262: 902-905Google Scholar, 32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J.

The 75- and 116-kDa molecules are constitutively associated with the SH3 domains of Grb2 analogous to the Grb2/Sos association and are substrates for TCR-activated PTKs (32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14089Google Scholar, 33Motto D.G. Ross S.E. Jackman J.K. Sun Q. Olson A.L. Findell P.R. Koretsky G.A. J. Biol Chem. 1994; 269: 21608-21613Google Scholar). The p75 is apparently a hematopoietic cell-specific protein. Its structure and protein sequence are not known, but on the basis of its association with the Grb2 SH3 domains, p75 is a candidate for a second Grb2 downstream effector molecule. Shc and p36 when tyrosine phosphorylated bind to the SH2 domain of Grb2. In TCR-activated T cells, both Shc and p36 are tyrosine phosphorylated and could potentially form a complex with Grb2 SH2 domains. However, the predominant complexes that can be detected are composed of p36-Grb2-Sos (25Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 35Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Google Scholar). Studies in B cells have generated evidence for regulation of Grb2 complexes by the BCR. In this system both Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and the formation of Shc-Grb2-Sos complexes are observed in response to BCR ligation (36Smit L. De Vries-Smit A.M.M. Bos J.L. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20209-20212Google Scholar, 37Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623Google Scholar) The pattern of PTK activation in response to BCR or FcεR1 triggering is similar, particularly in the stimulation of the 72-kDa PTK Syk (12Benhamou M. Ryba N.J.P. Kihara H. Nishikata H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23318-23324Google Scholar). However, there has been no analysis of the regulation of adapter molecules such as Grb2 and Shc in FcεR1-stimulated cells. Accordingly, the object of the present studies was to examine whether Grb2 and associated molecules are regulated by the FcεR1. The data presented here show that the SH3 domain of Grb2 binds Sos and 75-, 120-, and 140-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins whereas the major Grb2 SH2 domain-binding proteins are Shc and an unknown 33-kDa protein. Two of the Grb2-binding proteins described herein are tyrosine phosphorylated in response to FcεR1 ligation: the 75-kDa protein which binds to Grb2 SH3 domains and the 33-kDa protein that associates with the Grb2 SH2 domain. Shc is apparently not a substrate for FcεR1-activated PTKs and hence its association with Grb2 is not controlled by cell activation. The present report thus demonstrates that there are multiple Grb2-containing protein complexes in mast cells of which a subset are FcεR1-regulated. The anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc (Lake Placid, NY). The anti-phosphotyrosine antibody FB2 (W. Fantl, University of California) was purified from hybridoma supernatant. Polyclonal anti-Shc antibody was purchased from TCS Biologicals. Monoclonal anti-Dinitrophenyl (mouse IgE isotype) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-mouse Sos1 and anti-Grb2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. and Affiniti (Nottingham, United Kingdom), respectively. The monoclonal antibody JRK1, with specificity for the β chain of FcεR1 (38Rivera J. Kinet J.P. Kim J. Pucillo C. Metzger H. Mol. Immunol. 1988; 25: 647-661Google Scholar), was a generous gift of Dr. Juan Rivera (NIAMS, Bethesda, MD). The EGFR-Y1068 peptide sequence is PVPEpYINQS. The Trk-Y490 peptide sequence is IENPQpYFSDA. For use in affinity purification these peptides were coupled to Affi-Gel 10 beads (Bio-Rad). The following glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions were used and have been previously described (28Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-50Google Scholar, 32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14089Google Scholar). GST-alone, GST-Grb2 (full-length Grb2), GST-μSH3 49L/203R double SH3 mutant, GST-Grb2NSH3 isolated amino-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 1-58), GST-Grb2 CSH3 isolated carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain (amino acids 159-217) and GST-Sos (mSos1 carboxyl-terminal residues 1135-1336). The fusion proteins were coupled to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) for affinity purification experiments. The rat basophilic leukemia cell line RBL2H3 was a gift of Dr. Roberto Solari, Glaxo Research and Development, U.K. They were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (56°C for 30 min) fetal bovine serum and 2 m M glutamine. Only the adherent fraction of the cell cultures was passaged or used in experiments. RBL2H3 monolayer cells were detached from the culture flask using a cell scraper, washed once, and primed in suspension with 1 μg/ml IgE anti-dinitrophenol (IgE anti-DNP) in RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C. Receptor cross-linking was effected using 10 μg/ml keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH)-DNP conjugate (Calbiochem) at 37°C. After stimulation all cells were placed on ice and pelleted immediately in a microfuge. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 m M HEPES (pH 7.4), 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 150 m M NaCl, 20 m M NaF, 20 m M iodoacetamide, 1 m M phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml protease inhibitors (leupeptin, pepstatin A, and chymotrypsin), and 1 m M Na3VO4. Lysates (1.5 × 107RBL2H3) were precleared with Protein A-insoluble suspension (Sigma) for 15 min at 4°C. Lysates for fusion protein affinity purifications were then precleared with glutathione-agarose bead suspension (Sigma). Lysates for peptide precipitations (Trk-Y490 and EGFR-Y1068) were cleared with Affi-Gel 10 (Pharmacia). Affinity purifications with specific reagents were carried out for 2 h at 4°C with constant rotation. The beads were washed three times in 1 ml of lysis buffer and boiled in reducing SDS sample buffer for 10 min. Samples were resolved on 11% SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore) which was blocked in 5% non-fat milk for 1 h. The membrane was probed with a specific antibody followed by an appropriate second stage horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham). Reactive bands were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham). The data in Fig. 1 show a Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies of total cell lysates from quiescent and FcεR1-stimulated RBL2H3 cells. The experiment demonstrates that there is prominent FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins at 80, 70, and 55 kDa. This phosphorylation is rapid, detected within 2 min and sustained for a period of 30 min. In control experiments no increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of any proteins in RBL2H3 cells which have been incubated with monomeric IgE but not exposed to cross-linking multivalent antigen was observed. Binding experiments with a GST-fusion protein of wild type Grb2 were carried out in order to establish whether FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoproteins include a subset of Grb2-binding proteins. The data from this experiment are shown in Fig. 2. In precipitates purified from RBL2H3 cell lysates with GST-Grb2, there are multiple tyrosine phosphoproteins in both quiescent and activated cells. Many proteins are observed which are basally tyrosine phosphorylated in unstimulated cells. However, there is an FcεR1-induced increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins migrating at 120, 110, 75, 65, and 30-33 kDa.Figure 2:Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot showing SH domain specificity of tyrosyl proteins binding to Grb2 in RBL2H3 cells. 2 × 107RBL2H3 cells/point were primed as described and stimulated with 10 μg/ml KLH-DNP for the time indicated in minutes at 37°C. Lysates were affinity purified for 2 h with the Grb2 fusion protein indicated. The panel of GST fusion proteins used were the wild type GST-Grb2, the single SH3 domain truncations GST-Grb2NSH3 and GST-Grb2CSH3, and the double SH3 mutant GST-Grb2 μSH3. GST alone coupled to glutathione-agarose beads was included as a negative control. Samples were resolved on 11% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions before transfer to PVDF membrane, blocking with non-fat milk, and Western blot analysis with 4G10.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The experiment in Fig. 2 explores also the SH domain specificity of FcεR1-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated Grb2-binding proteins. Affinity binding experiments were performed with truncated or mutated Grb2 fusion proteins comprising the isolated Grb2 NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal SH3 domains, called GST-Grb2NSH3 and GST-Grb2CSH3, respectively. In addition, GST-Grb2 with mutations in both SH3 domains which leave the SH2 domain intact (GST-Grb2 μSH3) was used. Fig. 2 shows a Western blot analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies on proteins affinity purified from RBL2H3 lysates using the panel of GST-Grb2 variants in comparison with wild-type GST-Grb2. The data show that a prominent FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoprotein of 75 kDa was detected in the precipitates isolated with wild type GST-Grb2, GST-Grb2NSH3, or GST-Grb2CSH3 fusion proteins. Both GST-Grb2 SH3 domain fusion proteins also purified tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 38, 52-55, 120, and 140 kDa. Cross-linking of the FcεR1 induced tyrosine phosphorylation of 33- and 65-kDa proteins which bound to the wild type GST-Grb2 fusion protein. These species did not bind the isolated Grb2 SH3 domains. In addition to the isolated SH3 domains, further characterization of domain specificities was possible using the GST-Grb2 μSH3 molecule. This is a full-length Grb2 construct which has point mutations introduced into each of the SH3 domains but an intact SH2 domain. The FcεR1-induced 75-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein did not bind to the GSTGrb2 μSH3 fusion protein, nor did the 110-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein. However, FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoproteins of 33 and 65 kDa bound efficiently to the GST-Grb2 μSH3 protein. As well, a 55-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein and a doublet of high molecular mass tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 120-140 kDa were detected binding to GST-Grb2 μSH3. The latter species were inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in FcεR1-activated RBL2H3 to varying degrees between experiments. From these binding studies it can be concluded that there are FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoproteins of 33 and 65 kDa which can bind to Grb2 SH2 domains. In addition, there is an FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoprotein of 75 kDa which binds to Grb2 SH3 domains. Other tyrosine phosphoproteins that associate with Grb2 SH3 domains and SH2 domains have molecular masses of 110-120 and 120-140 kDa, respectively. The binding experiments using truncated and mutated Grb2 fusion proteins show that the proteins migrating in the 110-120 kDa range may in fact be resolved into both basally and FcεR1-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Similarly, there are multiple tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins at 52-55 kDa binding to the intact GST-Grb2 fusion protein that resolve into both basally phosphorylated proteins and FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoproteins upon analysis with the truncated and mutant Grb2 fusion proteins. Initial experiments showed that there is a complicated pattern of FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoproteins which are capable of binding to Grb2 fusion proteins. Therefore, to establish whether there are FcεR1-induced complexes between tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and endogenous Grb2, we used affinity purification protocols to isolate Grb2 and associated proteins from RBL2H3 cell lysates. This technique has been described in detail previously (32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14089Google Scholar) and has been used effectively to examine Grb2 complexes in TCR-activated T-lymphocytes. Briefly, a synthetic tyrosine phosphopeptide corresponding to the autophosphorylation site Tyr-1068 in the carboxyl-terminal tail of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-Y1068) was used to precipitate Grb2 from RBL2H3 cells. The EGFR-Y1068 peptide binds to the Grb2 SH2 domain with nanomolar affinity and thus competitively blocks associations between cellular proteins and the SH2 domains of Grb2. Use of this peptide allows the copurification of Grb2 and proteins complexed with Grb2 SH3 domains. Grb2 was also purified from RBL2H3 cells using a GST fusion protein of a proline-rich fragment from the carboxyl terminus of murine Sos (GST-Sos). The GST-Sos fusion protein used in these experiments binds the Grb2 SH3 domain and therefore isolates Grb2 and proteins associated with the Grb2 SH2 domain. GST-Sos competitively prevents the copurification of Grb2 SH3-binding proteins. The data in Fig. 3 show an anti-Grb2 Western blot of the cellular proteins purified with GST-Sos or EGFR-Y1068 and indicate that these two reagents isolate equivalent levels of endogenous Grb2. Moreover, a comparison of the levels of Grb2 purified with EGFR-Y1068 or GST-Sos with Grb2 levels in total cell lysates (Fig. 3 A) shows that these reagents are capable of affinity purifying the majority of endogenous Grb2 from RBL2H3 cells. The data in Fig. 3 B show that it is possible to copurify Sos with Grb2 when the EGFR-Y1068 motif but not GST-Sos is used as an affinity matrix. To determine whether any of the tyrosine phosphoproteins observed in GST-Grb2 affinity purifications bind to endogenous Grb2 via its SH3 domains, we performed Western blot analysis with phosphotyrosine antibodies on Grb2 complexes isolated with EGFR-Y1068 peptide. As shown in Fig. 4 A, the EGFR-Y1068 peptide precipitates a 75-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein from FcεR1-activated but not quiescent RBL2H3 cells. The EGFR-Y1068 peptide also purified two tyrosine phosphoproteins of 110 and 120 kDa which were apparently equally phosphorylated in quiescent and FcεR1-activated cells. These tyrosine phosphoproteins appear to bind to endogenous Grb2 via its SH3 domains. They do not coprecipitate with Grb2 which has been isolated using the GST-Sos fusion protein to compete out Grb2 SH3-binding proteins (Fig. 4 B). They also comigrate with the 75-, 110-, and 120-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins detected in the binding experiments using GST-Grb2 single SH3 domain fusion proteins (Fig. 2). Affinity purification with the GST-Grb2 fusion protein produces the characteristic pattern of tyrosine phosphoproteins observed in previous experiments. It should be noted that there was a variable nonspecific binding of a 50-52-kDa doublet of tyrosine phosphoproteins to control affinity purifications comprising GST alone or Affi-Gel beads alone. The data in Fig. 4 B show anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of the endogenous Grb2 complexes isolated from RBL2H3 cells with GST-Sos. These data indicate that the 120-, 140-, and 65-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins observed binding to the normal and the double SH3 mutant GST-Grb2 fusion proteins do not coprecipitate with endogenous Grb2. However, an FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoprotein of 33 kDa was detected in the endogenous Grb2 complexes purified by GST-Sos. In addition, a tyrosine phosphoprotein of 55 kDa was observed to bind to endogenous Grb2 in both quiescent and FcεR1-stimulated RBL2H3. These p33 and p55 molecules appeared to bind to Grb2 SH2 domains based on their pattern of binding to the panel of Grb2 fusion proteins. As well, they did not coprecipitate with the Grb2 complexes purified with the EGFR-Y1068 peptide, and their interaction with endogenous Grb2 was competed by the EGFR-Y1068 peptide that binds to the Grb2 SH2 domain (data not shown). In many cells the adapter molecule Shc is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to receptor stimulation and forms a complex with Grb2 SH2 domains. Western blot analysis with Shc antisera has shown that RBL2H3 cells express two isoforms of Shc. The 55-kDa isoform is predominant and the 46-kDa Shc protein is a minor component of the Shc population in these cells. The data in Fig. 4 B show that a tyrosine phosphoprotein of 55 kDa is coprecipitated with endogenous Grb2 by the GST-Sos fusion protein from both quiescent and FcεR1-stimulated RBL2H3 cells. This protein had a slightly lower mobility than the nonspecific 50-52-kDa proteins described earlier and could thus possibly represent tyrosine phosphorylated 55-kDa Shc isoform. Accordingly, the blots were reprobed with a Shc antiserum. Fig. 4 B shows that the 55-kDa Shc isoform binds to the wild type and SH3-mutated Grb2 fusion proteins and also can be copurified with endogenous Grb2 by GST-Sos. The binding of Shc to endogenous Grb2 was not influenced by the activation state of the RBL2H3. To further analyze the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in RBL2H3 cells, we used a tyrosine phosphopeptide Trk-Y490, which corresponds to a high affinity binding site for Shc SH2 domains in the Trk subunit of the nerve growth factor receptor. This was used as a reagent to affinity purify Shc from RBL2H3 cells. The data in Fig. 5 A show an anti-Shc Western blot of proteins affinity purified with the Trk-Y490 peptide from RBL2H3 cells. The 55- and 46-kDa Shc isoforms bind to the Trk-Y490 peptide but not to the EGFR-Y1068 peptide used here as a specificity control. The data in Fig. 5 B show an anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot of Trk-Y490 peptide precipitates isolated from quiescent and FcεR1-triggered RBL2H3 cells. The 55-kDa Shc isoform is tyrosine phosphorylated in both quiescent and stimulated cells. These data demonstrate also that the 55-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein binding to GST-Grb2 and GST-Sos comigrates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated 55-kDa Shc protein purified with Trk-Y490. The nonspecific 50-52-kDa protein doublet can once again be observed binding to control Affi-Gel beads alone but with a different mobilty to either of the Shc isoforms. The accumulated evidence from the experiments in Figs. 1-5 show that FcεR1 triggering results in tyrosine phosphorylation of a 33-kDa protein which binds to endogenous Grb2 in an SH2 domain-mediated association. The β subunit of the FcεR1 is 30-33 kDa and is known to be tyrosine phosphorylated in response to receptor triggering. Accordingly, we examined whether the p33 Grb2-binding protein was the β subunit of the FcεR1 (Fig. 6). Western blot analysis with the FcεR1 β chain antibody JRK1 showed that the β chain can be immunoprecipitated with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody FB2 from FcεR1-stimulated but not quiescent cells (Fig. 6). Furthermore, it was possible to observe a hyperphosphorylated population of JRK1-immunoreactive β chain molecules in total lysates from FcεR1-activated RBL2H3. This latter population comigrated on SDS-PAGE with the population selected for by the FB2 anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitation. However, the 33-kDa Grb2-binding tyrosine phosphoprotein detected by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot analysis of GST-Grb2 affinity purifications from FceR1-stimulated RBL2H3 was not immunoreactive with the JRK1 antibody and is thus not the β subunit of the FcεR1. It is apparent, moreover, that the SDS-PAGE mobility of p33 is different from the tyrosine-phosphorylated β chain. The data presented here show that in RBL2H3 mast cells, as in many cell systems, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for p21ras, Sos, is complexed to the SH3 domains of Grb2. The data show also that there are FcεR1-induced complexes between tyrosine phosphoproteins and the adapter molecule Grb2. These include two basally tyrosine-phosphorylated 110- and 120-kDa molecules and a 75-kDa protein substrate for FcεR1-activated PTKs which binds to the Grb2 SH3 domain. Two protein substrates for FcεR1-activated tyrosine kinases were observed to bind GST fusion proteins of Grb2 but more importantly were also found in association with endogenous Grb2. A 75-kDa protein which was tyrosine phosphorylated in activated but not quiescent RBL2H3 cells was associated with the SH3 domains of Grb2. We also detected a 33-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein complexed to Grb2 SH2 domains in FcεR1 stimulated but not quiescent cells. Previous studies of Grb2-binding proteins in T cells have illustrated how experiments that identify Grb2-binding proteins solely on the basis of affinity purifications with GST-Grb2 fusion proteins can be misleading. This point is made again by the present study. Hence wild type GST-Grb2 fusion protein experiments suggested that in RBL2H3 lysates there are tyrosine phosphoproteins of 33, 55, 65, 120, and 140 kDa which are capable of binding to Grb2 SH2 domains. The 33- and 65-kDa proteins in particular are substrates for FcεR1-activated PTKs as evidenced by their inducible tyrosine phosphorylation. However, only the constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated 55-kDa and the FcεR1-induced 33-kDa tyrosine phosphoproteins were detected in association with endogenous Grb2 SH2 domains. Similarly, only a subset of the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins identified as Grb2 SH3-binding proteins by the in vitro binding experiments were present in the in vivo Grb2 complexes isolated from RBL2H3 cells: a 75-kDa FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoprotein and two proteins of 110 and 120 kDa, respectively, which were equivalently tyrosine phosphorylated in quiescent and activated cells and appeared to associate constitutively with Grb2 SH3 domains. It has been described in many cell systems that tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc forms a complex with Grb2 (28Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-50Google Scholar, 39Rozakis-Adcock M.J. McGlade J. Mbamalu M. Pelicci G. Daly R. Li W. Batzer A. Thomas S. Brugge J. Pelicci P.G. Schlessinger J. Pawson T. Nature. 1992; 360: 689-692Google Scholar). In the present study, Shc was observed to be tyrosine phosphorylated in quiescent RBL2H3 cells, and no increases in Shc tyrosine phosphorylation were detected in response to FcεR1 triggering. This suggests that Shc is not a major substrate for FcεR1-activated tyrosine kinases in RBL2H3 cells. In accordance with the lack of FcεR1 control of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation, no FcεR1-induced changes in Shc-Grb2 complex formation were observed in RBL2H3 cells although Shc was constitutively associated with Grb2 in an SH2 domain-mediated association. It has been previously noted that there is no significant formation of Shc-Grb2 complexes in response to TCR ligation in T cells (25Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 35Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Google Scholar). In contrast, in B cells ligation of the BCR induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and induces a Shc-Grb2-Sos complex that is proposed to link the BCR to p21ras (36Smit L. De Vries-Smit A.M.M. Bos J.L. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20209-20212Google Scholar, 37Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623Google Scholar). Interestingly, Shc is a reasonably abundant protein in both T cells and mast cells. Moreover, in both cell types cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interleukin-3 can stimulate high levels of Shc tyrosine phosphorylation and induce Shc-Grb2 complexes indicating that there are no technical problems in detecting such complexes in these cells (40Burns L.A. Karnitz L.M. Sutor S.L. Abraham R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17659-17661Google Scholar, 41Cutler R.L. Liu L. Damen J.E. Krystal G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21463-21465Google Scholar, 42Ravichandran K.S. Burakoff S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1599-1602Google Scholar). In the absence of inducible tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, a possible candidate for linking signals transduced by the FcεR1 to the Grb2 signaling pathway is a 33-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein. This p33 is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to FcεR1 stimulation and binds Grb2 SH2 domains. The β subunit of the FcεR1 has a similar molecular weight to p33 and is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to receptor ligation (17Li W. Deanin G.G. Margolis B. Schlessinger J. Oliver J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3176-3182Google Scholar). We have shown, however, that the p33 tyrosine phosphoprotein observed to bind the SH2 domain of endogenous Grb2 is not the β chain of the FcεR1. This does not exclude an indirect interaction between Grb2 and the FcεR1. The FcεR1-induced p33 molecule appears functionally analogous to the TCR-induced p36 phosphoprotein observed as the major tyrosine-phosphorylated species to bind Grb2 SH2 domains in activated T cells (25Buday L. Egan S.E. Viciana P.R. Cantrell D.A. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9019-9023Google Scholar, 35Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Google Scholar). It remains to be determined, however, whether p36 and p33 share any structural homology. In this context, studies in a variety of cell systems have identified many tyrosine kinase substrates with apparently diverse functions which can bind to Grb2 SH2 domains. These include adapters such as Shc, tyrosine phosphatases such as R-PTPα and Syp, and growth factor receptors and receptor subunits such as the EGF receptor and IRS-1 (27Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Google Scholar, 43Su J. Batzer A. Sap J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18731-18734Google Scholar, 44Scolnik E.Y. Lee C.H. Batzter A. Vicenti L.M. Zhou M. Daly R. Myers M.J. Backer J.M. Ullrich A. White M.F. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1929-1935Google Scholar). Accordingly, it appears that multiple mechanisms have evolved to couple cellular PTKs to Grb2, of which the p36 and now p33 molecules may be one type. One well-documented role of Grb2 is to couple tyrosine kinases to the guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos and hence to p21ras signaling pathways (45Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. VanAelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Barsagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Google Scholar). We have observed that triggering of the FcεR1 in RBL2H3 cells results in activation of p21ras and downstream effector molecules such as Raf-1 and the MAP kinase ERK2.2 2H. Turner and D. Cantrell, unpublished observations. The current data demonstrate that Sos is constitutively associated with Grb2 SH3 domains in RBL2H3 cells. Accordingly, the FcεR1-induced 33-kDa tyrosine phosphoprotein that binds to Grb2 SH2 domain may be an adapter that couples the FcεR1 to Grb2-Sos complexes thereby permitting FcεR1 stimulation of p21ras. However, it has been recognized increasingly that Grb2 may link PTKs to molecules other than Sos. For example, a second p21ras guanine nucleotide exchange protein C3G binds to Grb2 SH3 domains in PC12 cells (46Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Google Scholar). As well, the GTPase dynamin can bind to and be activated by Grb2 SH3 domains in vitro and in vivo (47Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Google Scholar). In the present report, we have shown that in RBL2H3 cells Grb2 SH3 domains do not only bind the p21ras guanine nucleotide exchange protein Sos. There are also tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 75, 110, and 120 kDa which associate with endogenous Grb2 SH3 domains. By analogy with Sos, C3G, and dynamin, the p75, p110, and p120 molecules are candidates for alternate Grb2 effector molecules. The p75 molecule is of particular interest in this context because it is a substrate for FcεR1-activated PTKs. One of the major substrates for FcεR1-activated PTKs has been recently cloned and is a 75-kDa protein termed SPY or HS1, which has an SH3 domain and also contains proline-rich sequences reminiscent of SH3-binding domains characterized in molecules such as Sos (48Fukamachi H. Yamada N. Miura T. Kato T. Ishikawa M. Gulbins E. Altman A. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 642-652Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of endogenous Grb2 complexes in both T cells and RBL2H3 cells demonstrated that HS1 is not the Grb2-associated p75 described in this study.3 3H. Turner, K. Reif, and S. Ley, unpublished observations. Associations between Grb2 and p75 have not been detected in fibroblasts suggesting that this molecule has a limited tissue distribution and hence function (32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14089Google Scholar). In preliminary analysis the FcεR1-induced p75 appears identical to a 75-kDa protein that is a substrate for TCR-activated PTKs and is constitutively associated with Grb2 SH3 domains in T cells (32Reif K. Buday L. Downward J. Cantrell D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14081-14089Google Scholar). We propose that p75 may be a common signaling element for the TAM-based receptor family that includes the TCR and the FcεR1. Recently, p120cbl, which is a substrate for TCR-activated PTKs, was shown to bind to the NH2-terminal SH3 domain of Grb2 fusion proteins (34Donovan J.A. Wange R.L. Langdon W.A. Samelson L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22921-22924Google Scholar). The constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated 120 kDa protein described herein to associate with endogenous Grb2 complexes was not p120cblalthough, p120 cblwas detected in the Grb2 fusion protein complexes isolated from RBL2H3 cells and corresponded to the 120-kDa FcεR1-induced tyrosine phosphoprotein seen in these complexes (data not shown). The role of the FcεR1 is to regulate the exocytosis of mast cell granules and to modulate cytokine gene expression. The present data have shown that the FcεR1 induces tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple Grb2-binding proteins, strongly suggesting that this adapter protein is involved in coupling the FcεR1 to one or more signal transduction pathways. It has been demonstrated that calcium and PKC have an important role in FcεR1-regulated cellular responses (21Ozawa K. Szallis Z. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Mischak H. Mushinski J.F. Beaven M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1749-1756Google Scholar). We would propose that Grb2-coupled signaling pathways may also be important for FcεR1-induced mast cell activation.

After 4 days of culture in the presence of the inducer dimethyl sulfoxide, MEL cells expressed high levels of the erythroid-specific proteins, globin, and band 3. During the same interval, cellular contents (mol/cell) of E2-14K, E2-25K, and E2-35K decreased up to ~5-fold; as suggested by results obtained with E2-25K, this reflected a lower level of mRNA in differentiating cells. Concentrations of these E2s changed more modestly during in vitro differentiation, since cellular volume also decreased. Comparison of levels of the three E2s in undifferentiated MEL cells and reticulocytes suggests that their concentrations remain fairly constant during in vivo differentiation of proerythroblasts into reticulocytes.

Many processes of terminal differentiation involve extensive remodeling of the complement of cellular proteins, including the elimination of previously stable polypeptides. During erythroid differentiation, for example, there is a programmed loss of most proteins from the progenitor cell, concomitant with induced expression of a limited number of proteins (1.Rapoport S. The Reticulocyte. CRC Press, Boca Raton. FL1986Google Scholar). The precise mechanismts) by which programmed protein elimination is accomplished during this and other processes of terminal differentiation is unknown. The multienzyme ubiquitin-dependent proteolytic pathway is highly active in reticulocytes (2.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Heller H. Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 77: 1783-1786Google Scholar), and mediates the degradation of hexokinase (3.Magnani M. Stocchi V. Chiarantini L. Serafini G. Dacha M. Fornaini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8327-8333Google Scholar) and mito-chondrial proteins (4.Rapoport S.M. Schewe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 864: 471-495Google Scholar) in reticulocyte extracts. These observations suggest that the ubiquitin pathway may function in remodeling of the cellular protein complement during erythroid differentiation. Such a role might be expected to involve modulation of the specificity or global activity of this pathway, which in actively dividing cells carries out turnover of most short-lived proteins (5.Ciechanover A. Finley D. Varshavsky A. Cell. 1984; 37: 57-66Google Scholar, 6.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 540-543Google Scholar), including certain regulatory proteins (7.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Google Scholar, 8.Scheffner M. Werness B.A. Huibregste J.M. Levine A.J. Howley P.M. Cell. 1990; 63: 1129-1136Google Scholar, 9.Shanklin J. Jabben M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 359-363Google Scholar). The mechanistic role of ubiquitin in proteolysis is that of a covalent signal for degradation (10.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-808Google Scholar). Ubiquitin-protein conjugates have an isopeptide structure, in which the ubiquitin C terminus (Gly76) is linked to the side chain of an internal Lys residue of the target protein. Degradation, which is carried out by the 26 S proteasome, is particularly efficient when a homopolymeric multiubiquitin chain is elaborated on the target protein Lys residue, via formation of Gly76-Lys48 isopeptide bonds between successive ubiquitins (11.Chau V. Tobias J.W. Bachmair A. Marriott D. Ecker D.J. Gonda D.K. Varshavsky A. Science. 1989; 243: 1576-1583Google Scholar, 12.Gregori L. Poasch M.S. Cousins G. Chau V. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8354-8357Google Scholar). Ubiquitination is a multistep process (10.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-808Google Scholar, 13.Hershko A. Heller H. Elias S. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 8206-8214Google Scholar) which begins with ubiquitin activation through formation of a thiol ester with ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). Ubiquitin is next transferred to the activesite thiol of a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and then finally transferred to the target protein. This last step usually involves a ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). Specificity in ubiquitin-mediated turnover appears to arise mainly in the ubiquitination step, and reflects in part the existence of multiple E2 and E3 enzymes with defined specificities (10.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-808Google Scholar, 14.Jentsch S. Seufert W. Hauser H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 127-139Google Scholar). Currently several types of E3 are known (15.Reiss Y. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3685-3690Google Scholar, 16.Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6532-6535Google Scholar, 17.Bartel B. Wunning I. Varshavsky A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3179-3189Google Scholar, 18.Huibregste J.M. Scheffner M. Howley P.M. Mol. Cell. Bioi. 1993; 13: 775-784Google Scholar), and there are more than 10 members of the conserved E2 protein family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and in mammalian cells (14.Jentsch S. Seufert W. Hauser H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1089: 127-139Google Scholar). Certain E2s have well-defined biological roles. Thus in S. cerevisiae, the DBC1, -4, and -5 proteins have overlapping functions in turnover of the bulk of short-lived proteins (6.Seufert W. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 540-543Google Scholar, 19.Seufert W. McGrath J.P. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1990; 13: 4535-4541Google Scholar), and RAD6(DBC2) is essential for DNA repair (20.Jentsch S. McGrath J.P. Varshavsky A. Nature. 1987; 329: 131-143Google Scholar). In mammals, a close homolog of DBC5 functions in turnover of p53 (21.Scheffner M. Huibregste J.M. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8797-8801Google Scholar), and probably in other degradation as well. These and other findings have led to the view that individual E2s act on specific intracellular targets, either through direct interaction with these targets, and/or through interaction with specific E3s. However, the physiological roles of many E2s, especially in mammals, remain poorly understood. Prior work on changes in the activities of ubiquitin conjugating components during erythroid differentiation has focused on the terminal maturation of reticulocytes to erythrocytes (2224). Here we report on studies of ubiquitination in murine erythroleukemia (MEL)l cells, which allow access to stages of differentiation between the proerythroblast and very early re1ticulocytes (25.Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar, 26.Parker D. Housman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 604-609Google Scholar, 27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J.

The results bear on the role of the ubiquitin pathway in protein remodeling during erythroid differentiation, and also on the biological roles of specific E2 proteins. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (with glucose and L-glutamine, without pyruvate and bicarbonate) was from Life Technologies, Inc. FBS (Sigma or Life Technologies, Inc.) was heat-inactivated (50°C, 60 min); the results of preliminary experiments were used to select lots of FBS which effectively supported induction of band 3 protein during differentiation (below). MEL cell clone CD5, selected for ability to differentiate in response to Me2SO, was provided by Dr. V. Patel (Northwestern Univ.). Sterile BSA solution was from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim. Human foreskin fibronectin was from UBI. Imferon (an iron-dextran formulation) was from Fisons. Other reagents were from Sigma, except where indicated. Experiments were initiated within 2 weeks of thawing frozen cells. Prior to initiating experiments, cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS, 4.4 mx sodium bicarbonate, and 0.1 mg/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin, in a humid 37°C incubator (8% CO 2), and cell densities were rigorously maintained between 2 and 9 x 10 5 cells/ml. The standard differentiation protocol employed a stabilizing medium containing: Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4.4 mM bicarbonate, 13% FBS, 4-5% BSA, and 1.8 mM Imferon, pH 7.4 (26.Parker D. Housman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 604-609Google Scholar, 27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar, 28.Volloch V. Housman D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 390-394Google Scholar). One day before beginning an experiment, cells were diluted into a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of standard medium:differentiation medium. After 12-18 h, the cells were pelleted and resuspended in warm differentiation medium. After 12-18 h more, the experiment was initiated by diluting the cells into differentiation medium containing (differentiation) or lacking (control) 1.8% (v/v) Me 2SO, at a final density of 5-7 x 10' cells/ml. After 3 days of growth, cells were pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in the same volume of differentiation medium without Me 2SO. (Control cell medium was also changed.) Otherwise cultures were not disturbed until harvest. Growth of MEL cells on a fibronectin matrix can provide certain advantages in studies of differentiation (27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar). In initial experiments comparing cells grown in suspension versus on fibronectin-coated plates, we obtained qualitatively similar results over 96 h in regard to levels of band 3, globin, E2 proteins, and ubiquitin conjugates (culture on fibronectin as described in Ref. 27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar; data not shown). Since fibronectin is expensive and its use offered no special advantages in our studies, most experiments were carried out in suspension culture (above). As expected (26.Parker D. Housman D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 604-609Google Scholar, 28.Volloch V. Housman D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 390-394Google Scholar), MEL cells cultured in suspension differentiated efficiently only if BSA was present in the medium. Cells were washed once with cold Hank's balanced salt solution with HEPES (50 mM, pH 7.4) containing 10-20 mg/ml BSA, suspended in Hank's balanced salt solution buffered with HEPES (no BSA), and counted with a hemocytometer. Cells were pelleted, and lysed by vortexing in extraction buffer (70 ILl of buffer/2.5 x 10 6 cells) containing: 5 roM Tris-HCl (24% base, pH 7.6), 5 mM EDTA (pH 7), 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (or iodoacetamide), 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), 0.1% SDS, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 mM TLCK, 10 ILg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor and leupeptin, and 4 or 8 Murea. (Urea improved the long-term stability of ubiquitin conjugates in the lysate.) After 10 min on ice, the extract was centrifuged in the cold (15,000 x g, 5 min.) The supernatant was stored at -60°C. Occasionally, a two-step extraction procedure (27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar) was used, and gave identical results in blotting experiments. In experiments with cells grown on fibronectin-coated plates, harvesting and lysis were as described (27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar). Undifferentiated MEL cells, 2 X 107, were harvested and washed (above), and suspended in 1 ml of buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl (24% base), 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.25 roM TLCK, and 10 ILg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor and leupeptin. Cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce until >90% lysis had occurred as judged by microscopic examination. The lysate was centrifuged (700 x g, 2 min) to produce a nuclear pellet. The 700 x g supernatant was centrifuged (9,000 x g, 15 min) to produce a crude mitochondrial pellet. The 9,000 x g supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 x g, 60 min) to produce a microsomal/ribosomal pellet. The final supernatant served as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet of each spin was suspended in a volume of lysis buffer equal to the volume of the supernatant from the same spin. Affinity-purified antibodies specific for the conjugated and free forms of ubiquitin (herein termed conjugate and free ubiquitin antibodies, respectively) were prepared as described (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar, 29.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Google Scholar). Affinity purified antibodies against yeast RAD6 protein were provided by L. Prakash (University of Texas, Galveston). Other antibodies (below) were raised by immunizing female New Zealand White rabbits (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar), and affinity purified (22.Haas A.L.

Lodish H.F. Nature. 1985; 316: 234-238Google Scholar), coupled to bovine -y-globulin with glutaraldehyde (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). Antibodies were purified on a peptide-Sepharose column (0.8 ILmol of peptide/ml resin) prepared from activated CH-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). For E2-25K, we immunized with the purified recombinant protein (31.Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14418-14423Google Scholar), and purified the antibodies on an E2-25KSepharose column (0.7 mg of E2/ml resin). For E2-230K, we immunized with a synthetic peptide (CVSDSGLFFDDSY, below) coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin using the heterobifunctional cross-linker m-maleimidobenzoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma). Antibodies were purified on a column in which the peptide was bound to Sulfolink resin (Pierce) through its Cys sulfhydryl group (0.25 ILmolof peptide/ml of resin). Affinity eluates were concentrated to ~ 10% of the starting serum volume. E1 and E2 proteins were purified by methods standard in our laboratory (23.Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Google Scholar, 32.Klemperer N.S. Berleth E.S. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6035-6041Google Scholar). Isopeptidase T was purified to 90% homogeneity from bovine erythrocytes (33.Hadari T. Warms J.V.B. Rose I.A. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 719-727Google Scholar). Erythrocyte ghosts were prepared from murine erythrocytes by hypotonic lysis (34.Steck T. Fairbanks G. Wallach D.H.F. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 2617-2624Google Scholar). A standard of conjugated ubiquitin for slotblotting was prepared using rabbit reticulocyte fraction II (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar) and quenched in lysis buffer containing Nonidet P-40 and 8 Murea (above). The multiubiquitin chain standard contained equal amounts (ILg) of purified ubiquitin monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, and hexamer (31.Pickart C.M. Haldeman M.T. Kasperek E.M. Chen Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14418-14423Google Scholar). Digestion of proteins, resolution of peptides, and sequencing were carried out at the Harvard Microchemistry Facility. A, purified rabbit reticulocyte E2-230K (32.Klemperer N.S. Berleth E.S. Pickart C.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6035-6041Google Scholar), 20 ILg, was run on a preparative SDS-PAGE gel and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The E2230K band was located by staining with Ponceau S, excised from the blot, and the protein digested with trypsin in situ. Tryptic peptides were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, and a well resolved peptide was sequenced (VSDSGLFFDDSY). B, purified reduced and carboxymethylated rabbit reticulocyte E2-35K, ~50 ILg, was digested in solution with endoproteinase Lys-C, and peptides were resolved by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. A well resolved peptide was sequenced (“Results”). Unless otherwise stated, SDS-PAGE was performed in 0.75-mm thick mini gels (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Blotting (onto Immobilon, Millipore) and immunostaining were carried out as described (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar), except that the washing buffer also contained 0.5% (v/v) Tween 20. 125I-Protein A, used at 1 ILCi/ml, was from ICN or Amersham (Bolton-Hunter labeled, affinity-purified). Immunostained bands were detected by autoradiography (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). Dilutions of primary antibodies were: anti-RAD6 (1:1000; 13.5% gels); anti-band 3 (1:150; 8% gels); anti-E2-25K (1:2000; 12.5% gels); anti-conjugate (1:1500; 12.5 or 13.5% gels); anti-E2-230K (1:1000; 8% gels). For purposes of quantitation, cell extracts were run on gels together with amounts of purified E2 bracketing the physiological [E2] range. Autoradiographs were usually analyzed by densitometry (23.Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Google Scholar, 36.Pickart C.M. Summers R.G. Shim H. Kasperek E.M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1991; 33: 587-598Google Scholar); cellular E2 levels were estimated by comparison to the standard curve. In some cases, immunostained bands were excised from the blot (following autoradiography) and counted directly; here also, unknowns were quantitated by comparison to the standard curve. Levels of band 3 protein were quantitated using a standard of murine erythrocyte ghosts. Coomassie-stained gels were analyzed by direct densitometry, using loads in the linear range of signal. Slot-blotting was carried out as described (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar). Standards containing 10-500 fmol of conjugated ubiquitin in 100 ILl ofTS buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 M NaCI) were applied to Immobilon in triplicate, together with diluted lysates from MEL cells (l03 to 10 5 cell equivalents in 100 ILl of TS). Slot-blots were immunostained using conjugate antibodies and 125I_protein A (above); autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry (23,36). Solution-phase radioimmunoassay (22.Haas A.L. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 12464-12473Google Scholar) of free ubiquitin was carried out using free ubiquitin antibodies (29.Haas A.L. Murphy K.E. Bright P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 4694-4703Google Scholar). This was carried out by the method of O'Farrell (37.O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Google Scholar) in tubes of 1.5 mm x 5.5 em, using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean isoelectric focusing apparatus according to the manufacturer's instructions, with pH 3-10 ampholines (Bio-Rad). After loading, tube gels were focused for 10 min at 500 V, followed by 3.5 h at 750 V. IEF gels were either equilibrated with SDS-PAGE sample buffer (35.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) immediately, or frozen at -60°C until use. Second dimension SDSPAGE was carried out using I-rnm thick mini gels (12.5% acrylamide). Partial Purification of Multiubiquitin Chains from MEL Cells-Undifferentiated MEL cells, 8 x 10 7 , were lysed in 2 ml of buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 8 M urea (above). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation and applied to 1 ml of Q-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with 50 mxt Tris-H CI (24% base, pH 7.6). A 5-ml wash with this buffer was combined with the unbound fraction; the pooled material was adjusted to pH 4.5 with 2 N acetic acid and applied to 1 ml of S-Sepharose equilibrated with 50 mxi ammonium acetate , pH 4.5. The loaded column was washed with 10 ml of the same buffer, and then eluted, with 2 ml of the same buffer containing 1 ~I Na CI, into a Centric on-10 microconcentrator (Arnicon) containing 2 mg of ovalbumin (carrier) . The eluate was concentrated and diluted repeatedly with 50 mxt Tris-HCI (24% base), to remove salt. Aliquots of each purifica tion stage were examined by one-dimensional blotting with conjugate antibodies; the results (not shown) indicated that some disassembly of chains occurred during purification. Control and differentiated MEL cells , 108 of each type, were harvested after 100 h of growth , andlysed using a Dounce (above), in 2 ml of buffer containing: 20 mxt Tris-HCI (24% base), 1 rnxt EDTA , 2 rnxt dithiothreitol, 20 mxr NaCI, 0.1 rnxt phenylm ethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin , and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor. Proteins soluble following centrifugation at 100,000 × g were fractionated by anion exchange chromatography as described (38.Pickart C.M. Graziani L.A. Dosch S.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 114-121Google Scholar), except that a Q-Sepharose column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) was used . Fractions were collected into Centricon- 10 micro concentrators (Amicon), and exchanged into buffer (above) lacking NaCl. Each fraction was concentrated to 250 μl, and an 8-μl aliquot (3 x 106 cell equivalent) was assayed for the presence of 125I-ubiquitin thiol ester-forming species in the presence of MgATP and purified E1 (38.Pickart C.M. Graziani L.A. Dosch S.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 272: 114-121Google Scholar). Autoradiographs were analyzed by densitometry (23.Pickart C.M. Vella A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12028-12035Google Scholar, 36.Pickart C.M. Summers R.G. Shim H. Kasperek E.M. Dev. Growth Differ. 1991; 33: 587-598Google Scholar). Preparation of total RNA, electrophoresis, and Northern blotting were carried out by established procedures (39.Chirgwin J.J. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Google Scholar, 40.Ausubel F.A. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley and Sons, New York1990Google Scholar). All hybridization steps were carried out at 65 °C. Blots were prehybridized (1 h ) in a solution containing: 5 x SSPE, 10 x Denhardt's, 100 μg/ml sheared salmon sperm DNA, 50% formamide , and 0.5% SDS. The blot was hybridized overnight with a 32P-labeled riboprobe corresponding to the 300 5ʹ- nucleotides of the bovine E2-25 K cDNA (106cpm/ml; gift of L. Mastrandrea, State University of New York at Buffalo). The blot was washed twice with 1 x SSPE, 0.5% SDS , and then once with 55% formamide, 2 x SS PE, 1% SDS. MEL cells are stably transformed with the Friend erythroleukemia virus (25.Friend C. Scher W. Holland J.G. Sato T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1971; 68: 378-382Google Scholar). They are arrested at a proerythroblast-like stage, but becom committed to partial progression through the erythroid differentiation program following addition of Me2SO or other inducers to the medium. In vitro differentiation is marked by cessation of cell division, loss of the fibronect in receptor, changes in cytoskeletal proteins, induction of globin and the erythrocyte anion transporter (band 3), and a decrease in cell volume (2528). Under certain conditions, these changes may approach or equal what is seen in reticulocyte formation in vivo. Since highly differentiated MEL cells are fragile (28.Volloch V. Housman D. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 390-394Google Scholar), we cultured cells, in suspension, in a BSA-containing medium that provides mechanical stabilization (26 - 28). Control cells grown in this way maintained log-phase growth for 4 days, while cells growing in the presence of Me2SO stopped dividing at ~72 h (data not shown). These growth properties are consistent with prior reports (27.Patel V.P. Lodish H.F. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3105-3118Google Scholar, 41.GuptaRoy B. Cohen C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15326-15333Google Scholar). Band 3, an erythroid-specific protein, was first observed in differentiating cells at 72 h , and by 96 h reached the level seen in murine erythrocytes (Fig. 1A, lanes 1-4 versus 5-8). PAGE to monitor globin expression during differentiation . Globin protein was apparent in differentiating cells at ~72 h; by 96 h globin content was 43 ±11% of that in mature human erythrocytes, as determined by densitometry (n = 6; five independent experiments; Fig. 1B, lanes 5-8). As used here (and below), the term “content” refers to protein level normalized to cell number (i.e. mol or μg/cell). This method of normalization was used because cell number was easily determined with high accuracy. Changes in content are converted to changes in concentration by taking in to account changes in cell volume (below). A second feature of differentiated cells, usually apparent by 48h , was a decreased content of non-globin proteins (Fig. 1B, lanes 2-4 versus 6-8). To quantitate this effect, lanes 5 and 8 in Fig. 1B (and comparable lanes from other experiments) were scanned by densitometry. Peak areas were summed for all bands migrating more slowly than globin, and the results compared between lanes. The content of non-globin proteins in differentiated cells at 96h was - 60% of that in control cells (61±6%; n = 3; three experiments), but since there was a corresponding decrease in cell volume (below), the total concentration of non-globin proteins was comparable in control and differentiated cells. Overall, the data shown in Fig. 1 indicate that MEL cells grown in suspension in BSA-containing medium execute several aspects of the normal erythroid differentiation program, namely induced expression of erythroid-specific proteins (globin and band 3), and a reduction in the content of “progenitor” cell proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2042076482,"Lack of suitable amplification markers has hindered the use of the yeast system for investigating the mechanism of gene amplification in a eukaryote with a simple genome and well defined genetic system. Recently, methotrexate has been used to select for <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> mutants with <i>de novo</i> amplification of the dihydrofolate reductase gene (<i>DFR1</i>) (Huang, T. (1993) <i>In Vivo Disruption and de Novo Amplification of the DFR1 Gene Encoding Dihydrofolate Reductase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>. Ph. D. thesis, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada). We report here the detailed structure of a <i>DFR1</i> episome amplified in methotrexate-resistant strain 25-1. The extrachromosomal DNA is found predominantly as a single 11-kilobase circular molecule. It consists of a 5.5-kilobase inverted duplication that contains the <i>DFR1</i> locus and adjacent ARS (autonomously replicating sequence) element. This molecular configuration mimics the inferred structure of double minute chromosomes observed in a number of mammalian amplification systems and suggests that mechanisms that generate amplified DNAs are conserved from yeast to mammals."
https://openalex.org/W1505071304,"Granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) stimulates proliferation of various hematopoietic cells. Using cytoplasmic deletion mutants of the human GM-CSF receptor (hGMR) β subunit and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we previously showed that distinct signaling pathways of hGMR are involved in the induction of c- fos/c- jun mRNAs and of c- myc mRNA/cell proliferation. We used polyoma virus (Py) replicon to analyze the initiation of DNA replication induced by hGM-CSF in mouse BA/F3 pro-B cells expressing hGMR. hGM-CSF efficiently stimulated Py replication in the presence of Py enhancer and Py large T antigen supplied in trans. Analyses of Py enhancer mutants revealed that hGM-CSF promoted Py replication and activated transcription of the Py early promoter through the PEA3/PEBP5 region of Py enhancer. The membrane proximal region of hGMR β subunit is required for activation of PEA3/PEBP5-dependent replication which is also required for activation of DNA synthesis in the host cells. In contrast, a more distal region which is essential for activation of c- fos and c- jun genes is required for the PEA3/PEBP5-dependent transcription of Py early promoter. These results indicate that distinct signaling pathways of hGMR are required to activate PEA3/PEBP5-dependent replication and transcription although the same enhancer is required for both activities.

Kitamura T. Harada N. Yokota T. Arai K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 295-331Google Scholar, 2Watanabe S. Nakayama N. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1991; 2: 227-237Google Scholar). Interleukin-3 (IL-3) elicits similar, if not identical, activities. High affinity GM-CSF receptor (GMR) and IL-3 receptor consist of the α subunit specific to each and of a common β subunit. Although this high affinity GMR is mainly expressed in hematopoietic cells, reconstituted hGMR in fibroblasts transduces signals to activate early response genes and cell proliferation (3Watanabe S. Muto A. Mui A.-F. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Google Scholar). This means that hGMR can be linked to signal transduction pathways in fibroblasts and molecules specific to hematopoietic cells are not required to transduce these signals. Signal transducing molecules such as ras, raf, and microtubule-associated protein kinase required for the induction of c -fos mRNA linked with various growth factor receptors carrying tyrosine kinase activity have been extensively studied in fibroblast systems. These molecules are also involved in the GM-CSF/IL-3 signaling pathway for the induction of c- fos mRNA in hematopoietic cells (4Carroll M.P. Clark-Lewis I. Rapp U.R. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19812-19817Google Scholar, 5Satoh T. Uehara Y. Kaziro Y. J. Biol.

Analyses of hGMR β mutants carrying deletion from the cytoplasmic tail (C terminus) revealed that the region covering amino acid position up to 763 is required to activate c- fos and c- jun genes. In contrast, the region more proximal to membrane covering amino acid position up to 544 is required for activation of c- myc gene and proliferation (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar, 7Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Google Scholar). Furthermore, IL-3/GM-CSF induced c- fos and c- jun activation is insensitive to tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as herbimycin or genistein, whereas proliferation is completely suppressed by these reagents (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar). This indicates that the signaling pathway leading to DNA replication and activation of the c- myc gene is likely to be independent of the signaling pathway for the induction of c- fos/c- jun mRNAs. In contrast to the well characterized signaling pathway for activation of the c- fos gene, less is known of signaling mechanisms for cell proliferation and activation of the c- myc gene in mammalian cells. In yeast systems, characterization of cell cycle mutants led to identification of key molecules such as cdc2/28 or cyclin required for G1/to S phase transition (8Forsburg S.L. Nurse P. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 227-256Google Scholar). Subsequently, mammalian homologues of these kinases and cyclins were identified and their roles in regulation of cell cycle have been closely examined (9Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Google Scholar, 10Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.O. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1694Google Scholar). While cell cycle regulators such as cyclin-dependent kinase/cyclins and anti-oncogene such as retinoblastoma or p53 are regulated by growth factors including IL-3/GM-CSF (11Ando D. Ajchenbaum-Cymbalista F. Griffin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9571-9575Google Scholar, 12Borellini F. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7923-7928Google Scholar), the mechanisms by which these molecules regulate transition of G1to S phase remain unanswered. It should also be noted that the mechanism of initiation of DNA replication of mammalian chromosomes is largely unknown. Analyses of the regulation of initiation of chromosomal DNA replication by growth factors have been hampered because an appropriate assay for DNA replication of host cells has not been available. Protocols for assaying cell proliferation generally make use of incorporation into DNA of nucleotide substrates or analogues, or binding of drugs to DNA, none of these approaches provide direct information regarding the initiation of DNA replication. For example, the incorporation of radioactive thymidine does not distinguish initiation and elongation steps of replicative DNA synthesis. In addition, despite extensive efforts to characterize the nature of chromosomal origins of DNA replication, the results are inconclusive and even the presence of a specific replication origin is controversial (13DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Google Scholar). Replication systems which make use of defined DNA templates such as small phages and plasmids provided excellent models to study DNA replication in bacteria (14Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Likewise, virus systems offer many advantages for studying mammalian DNA replication (13DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Google Scholar, 15Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Google Scholar). The mechanisms of replication of SV40 and polyoma virus (Py), the closely related double stranded circular DNA virus, have been extensively studied in fibroblasts (14Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar). Several features of SV40 and Py make them attractive models to study chromosomal replication (15Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Google Scholar). In both systems, except for the large T antigen (LTag), all of the factors required for execution of replication are present in the host cells (15Challberg M.D. Kelly T.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 671-717Google Scholar). Second, Py or SV40 replication is host cell cycle dependent (16D'Urso G. Marraccino R.L. Marshak D.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1990; 250: 786-791Google Scholar). The Py system in particular is very useful, where Py LTag does not cause tumorigenic transformation even though it induces immortality, and middle Tag is mainly involved in transformation of the host cell. (17Rassoulzadegan M. Naghashfar Z. Cowie A. Carr A. Grisoni M. Kamen R. Cuzin F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 4354-4358Google Scholar). Another interesting feature of Py replicon is enhancer dependence of Py replication (13DePamphilis M.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 29-63Google Scholar). There are several observations that implicate involvement of transcription factor/enhancer for eukaryote chromosomal DNA replication. Py may be a good model to elucidate the role of enhancer in DNA replication (18Fangman W.L. Brewer B.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 363-366Google Scholar, 19Dutta A. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 709-712Google Scholar). Origin of Py consists of two elements, the origin core and the enhancer. The core contains a palindrome that includes two repeats of the LTag recognition pentanucleotide sequence motif and A/T-rich sequence. The enhancer sequence in the Py genome is essential for Py replication (20Tyndall C. La Mantia G. Thacker C.M. Favaloro J. Kamen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6231-6250Google Scholar), and is replaceable with cellular, viral, and yeast enhancers (21De Villiers J. Schaffner W. Tyndall C. Lupton S. Kamen R. Nature. 1984; 312: 242-246Google Scholar, 22Baru M. Shlissel M. Manor H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 3496-3503Google Scholar, 23Bennett-Cook E.R. Hassell J.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 959-969Google Scholar). Cell type specificity of Py replication is likely to be defined by the enhancer, because mutation or replacement of the enhancer region allow Py to replicate in types of cells different from the original (21De Villiers J. Schaffner W. Tyndall C. Lupton S. Kamen R. Nature. 1984; 312: 242-246Google Scholar, 24Herbomel P. Bourachot B. Yaniv M. Cell. 1984; 39: 653-662Google Scholar, 25Fujimura F.K. Deininger P.L.

Py replicon has been studied almost exclusively in mouse fibroblasts either transformed or in the presence of fetal calf serum. However, the requirement of growth factors or cytokines for Py replication has remained to be determined. Based on our finding that hGMR is functional in both hematopoietic cells and fibroblasts, we asked whether Py could serve as a model replicon to examine the initiation of DNA replication induced by IL-3/GM-CSF in hematopoietic cells. We obtained evidence that hGM-CSF induces Py replication in BA/F3 cells expressing hGMR. The region of the β subunit of hGMR required for Py replication is indistinguishable from that required for cell proliferation. Fetal calf serum was from Biocell laboratories Co. Ltd. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and RPMI 1640 were from Nikken BioMedial Laboratories Co. Ltd. Recombinant hGM-CSF and recombinant mIL-4 produced in Escherichia coli were provided by Dr. R. Kastelein, DNAX Research Institute. Mouse IL-3 (mIL-3) produced by silkworm (Bombyx mori) was purified as described elsewhere (27Miyajima A. Schreurs J. Otsu K. Kondo A. Arai K. Maeda S. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 58: 273-281Google Scholar). [α-32P]CTP, [α-32P]GTP, and [3H]acetylcoenzyme A were from Amersham Japan Co. Ltd. Genistein was from Wako Pure Chemicals. Herbimycin and G418 were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. A mIL-3-dependent pro-B cell line, BA/F3 (28Palacios R. Steinmetz M. Cell. 1985; 41: 727-734Google Scholar) was maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1 ng/ml mIL-3, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfected BA/F3 cells expressing hGMR α and β subunits (BA/FGMR) were grown in the same type of media but supplemented with 500 μg/ml G418. pPyOICAT contains the Py fragment (nt 5267-nt 152) which includes replication origin core sequence (nt 5267-nt 56) and early gene promoter but lacks enhancer region, and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) coding sequence (29Murakami Y. Asano M. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 5-13Google Scholar, 30Murakami Y. Satake M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3947-3951Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides or Py enhancer fragments were inserted at the BglII site of pPyOICAT for each plasmid. For pPyBPPCAT and pPyWACAT, the region from BclI site (nt 5021) to PvuII site (nt 5265) and A core (nt 5017-nt 5130) of Py enhancer was inserted, respectively, at the BglII site of pPyOICAT. The other inserted fragments are schematically shown in Fig. 3 A. pPyBPPΔCAT is an origin defective control plasmid with BPP fragment as an enhancer, lacking 4 base pairs (nt 5-nt 8) in the Py LTag binding site of the origin core. pRSVLTag is the expression plasmid, and contains the Py LTag coding region under the control of RSV-long terminal repeat. DNA replication of transfected plasmid was assayed by DpnI analysis (29Murakami Y. Asano M. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 5-13Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into semiconfluent BA/F3 cells (1.2 × 106cells/sample) by the DEAE-dextran method as described elsewhere (3Watanabe S. Muto A. Mui A.-F. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Google Scholar). Cells resuspended in factor-depleted media were incubated for 5 h and then stimulated with 5 ng/ml mIL-3, hGM-CSF, or mIL-4. After incubation for an additional 24 h, cells were harvested and washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline. Low molecular weight DNA was isolated by the Hirt extraction method (31Hirt B. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 26: 365-369Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Hirt solution (10% SDS, 10 m M Tris, pH 7.8, 10 m M EDTA) and lysed by incubation for 5 min at room temperature. Then, 250 μl of 5 M NaCl was added and mixed by tumbling. After an overnight incubation at 4°C, the extract was centrifuged for 60 min by a microcentrifuge. Supernatant was extracted twice with phenol/chloroform, and DNA was ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 20 μl of 10 m M Tris, pH 7.4, 1 m M EDTA. In separate experiments, radiolabeled plasmid DNA was used as an internal marker to determine the recovery of the low molecular weight DNA. Ten μl of DNA solution was digested with HindIII, that linearizes template plasmid, and DpnI. As DpnI digests only methylated or hemimethylated recognition sites of DNA, newly synthesized DNA is resistant to DpnI digestion. DNA were electrophoretically separated in a 0.8% agarose gel, and transferred to Hybond-N+ (Amersham) by alkaline blotting (32Reed K.C. Mann D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 7207-7221Google Scholar). DNA blots were hybridized with denatured HindIII-digested pPyOICAT DNA labeled with 32P by the random priming kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp., Cleveland, OH) using QuikHyb rapid hybridization solution (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and according to the manufacturer's instructions. Blots were washed and exposed to an imaging plate for 15 min and intensity of bands was quantified using a FUJI Image Analyzer (Model BAS-2000). CAT activities were analyzed by diffusion analysis (33Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Briefly, BA/F3 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of template DNA and 2 μg each of hGMR α and β subunits plasmids (3Watanabe S. Muto A. Mui A.-F. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Google Scholar) by the DEAE-dextran method and cultured overnight with complete media. Cells were depleted of mIL-3 for 5 h, and restimulated with 5 ng/ml of either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. After a 12-h incubation, cells were harvested and lysed in 50 μl of 0.25 M Tris, pH 7.4, by three cycles of freezing and thawing. Each sample containing approximately 50 μg of total protein was subjected to CAT activity. BA/F3 cells expressing various truncated β subunit mutants and the wild type α subunit (5 × 106) were depleted of mIL-3 for 5 h and stimulated with hGM-CSF or mIL-3. After incubation for 3 h, these cells were collected and nuclear proteins were extracted as described elsewhere (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar, 34Watanabe S. Yssel H. Harada Y. Arai K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 523-532Google Scholar). EMSA was made with nuclear extracts prepared from BA/F3 cells, according to the method described above. PEA3/PEBP5 (5′-CGCAGGAAGTGACGG-5′) oligonucleotide was chemically synthesized and purified by Sephadex G-50 nick columns (Pharmacia, Upsala, Sweden) after being labeled with [α-32P]dGTP. The extracts containing 5 μg of protein were incubated with a labeled probe for 15 min at room temperature in a total volume of 15 μl containing 10 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 50 m M KCl, 1 m M dithiothreitol, 1 m M EDTA, pH 8.0, 12.5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) as a nonspecific competitor. The DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 6.7 m M Tris, pH 7.5, 3.3 m M sodium acetate, and 1 m M EDTA, pH 8.0. Then the gel was transferred to Whatman 3MM paper, dried, and analyzed by the FUJI Image Analyzer (model BAS-2000). To determine whether or not IL-3 or GM-CSF induces the replication of Py, we analyzed the replication of transiently transfected plasmid pPyBPPCAT that contains the Py origin region, including the transcription initiation site with the entire Py enhancer BPP region (29Murakami Y. Asano M. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 5-13Google Scholar). The DNA template and pRSV-LTag, the expression plasmid supplying Py LTag in trans, were transfected using the DEAE-dextran method into BA/FGMR (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar, 35Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3550Google Scholar). This cell line extensively proliferates in response to mIL-3 or hGM-CSF and only transiently (up to 48 h) survives in the presence of mIL-4. Transfected cells were incubated without mIL-3 for 5 h and stimulated with mIL-3, hGM-CSF, or mIL-4. After a 24-h incubation, these cells were harvested and small molecular weight DNAs were extracted by the Hirt extraction method as described under “Materials and Methods.” DNAs were digested with DpnI which cleaves only unreplicated DNA. As shown in Fig. 1, mIL-3 and hGM-CSF but not mIL-4 induced replication of pPyBPPCAT. pPyBPPΔoriCAT, which lacks 4-base pair nucleotides (nt 5-nt 8) within the origin region and is unable to replicate in COP5 cells stably expressing Py LTag (29Murakami Y. Asano M. Satake M. Ito Y. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 5-13Google Scholar), did not replicate with either stimulation. These results demonstrated that mIL-3 or hGM-CSF stimulated Py origin-dependent replication in BA/FGMR cells. The lack of Py replication by mIL-4 may be consistent with the observation that mIL-4 supports the survival but not the proliferation of BA/F3 cells. Py LTag is a multifunctional protein essential for Py replication and regulation of Py early and late transcription (36Cogen G. Virology. 1978; 85: 222-230Google Scholar, 37Farmerie W.G. Folk W.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 68: 6919-6923Google Scholar). We next examined the dependence of mIL-3- or hGM-CSF-induced Py replication on Py LTag. BA/FGMR cells (5 × 106cells) were cotransfected with various amounts of pRSV-LTag DNA and 1 μg of pPyBPPoriCATand replication of the latter plasmid was analyzed as described above. As expected, Py replication was completely dependent on the presence of Py LTag (Fig. 2). pPyBPPoriCAT did not replicate in the absence of the LTag plasmid and the extent of replication was proportional to the amount of pRSV-LTag DNA cotransfected. In the following experiments, pRSV-LTag DNA, about 20-fold excess amount of template DNA containing Py replication origin, was used. The Py enhancer BPP contains two core elements, A and B. The A element has been shown to respond to external growth factor stimuli (38Yamaguchi Y. Satake M. Ito Y. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 1040-1048Google Scholar) and has been extensively characterized. The A element contains binding sites for at least three transcription activators, PEA1/PEBP1 (AP-1 consensus), PEA2/PEBP2, and PEA3/PEBP5 (ets family consensus). Transcription factors shown to interact with these binding motifs are AP-1, PEBP2 (39Ogawa E. Maruyama M. Kagoshima H. Inuzuka M. Lu J. Satake M. Shigesada K. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6859-6863Google Scholar) /CBF (core binding factor) (40Wang S. Wang Q. Crute B.E. Melnikova I.N. Keller S.R. Speck N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3324-3339Google Scholar), and PEBP3 (41Xin J. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes & Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Google Scholar) /PEA3-91 (42Martin M.E. Yang X.Y. Folk W.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2213-2221Google Scholar) /PEBP5 (43Cegielskaa A. Virshup D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1202-1211Google Scholar), respectively. To delineate DNA elements in Py enhancer responsible for mIL-3- or hGM-CSF-dependent replication, we employed various plasmids containing mutations in A element (30Murakami Y. Satake M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Ito Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3947-3951Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3 A, A element, either the wild type or the mutant carrying various point mutations, was inserted at the BglII site of the pPyOICAT plasmid. These plasmids were cotransfected with pRSV-LTag into BA/FGMR cells and replication of plasmid induced by either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF was analyzed. Transfection efficiency of each sample as judged by luciferase activity of cotransfected SRα-luciferase plasmid was nearly the same. pPyWACAT carrying the wild type A element replicate in response to mIL-3 (Fig. 3 B). pPyM3ACAT carrying two point mutations at the PEA3/PEBP5 site (ets site) failed to replicate in response to mIL-3, indicating that this site is essential for mIL-3-dependent Py replication. In contrast, pPyM1ACAT carrying two point mutations at the PEA1/PEBP1 site (AP-1 site) showed only a slight decrease in replication (Fig. 3 B), and pPyM2ACAT carrying two point mutations at the PEA2/PEBP2 site (CBF site) elicited a significantly reduced replicative activity. The relative level of replicated pPyCAT DNA plasmids were presented in Fig. 3 A. These results suggest that the AP-1 site, only slightly, and PEBP2/CBF site, to much greater degree, contribute to mIL-3-dependent Py replication. Essentially the same results were obtained with hGM-CSF stimulation (data not shown). To further confirm this finding, we next analyzed a series of plasmids that contain subfragments of either the wild type or the mutant A element in tandem and inserted at the BglII site of the pPyOICAT plasmid (Fig. 3 A). As expected, pPyALCAT containing six tandem repeats of the ets binding site replicated efficiently in response to mIL-3, and pPyAECAT containing six tandem repeats of the PEA2/PEBP2/CBF site replicated at a much lower level than pPyALCAT. pPyAMCAT, carrying six tandem repeats of the AP-1 site, showed almost no replicative activity in response to mIL-3 (Fig. 3 B). Essentially the same results were obtained with hGM-CSF stimulation. Taken together, these results show that the contribution to mIL-3 or hGM-CSF-induced Py replication is most prominent with the ets binding site, much less with the PEBP2/CBF site, and negligible with the AP-1 site. We previously showed that the cytoplasmic regions of hGMR β subunit required for induction of c- fos/c- jun mRNAs and c- myc mRNA induction/cell proliferation differ (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar, 7Sato N. Sakamaki K. Terada N. Arai K. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4181-4189Google Scholar). Mutant 544 carrying a deletion from the C terminus to amino acid position 544 is fully active, whereas mutant 517 is weakly active, and mutant 455 is completely inactive to induce c- myc mRNA induction/cell proliferation (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar). To determine whether or not the same region of hGMR β subunit is required for hGM-CSF-induced Py replication, we used BA/F3 cells expressing hGMR composed of the wild type α subunit and mutant β subunit carrying a series of C terminus deletions (BA/F3GMRβ mutants) (35Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3550Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, mutant 544 is fully active as the original β subunit, whereas mutant 517 is active but has a much reduced ability to support pPyWACAT replication. As expected, mutant 455 which lacks the potential to support proliferation of the host cells, failed to promote pPyWACAT replication. When pPyALCAT was used as the template, the requirement of hGMR β subunit for replication was stricter and mutant 517 had lost the potential to support replication of this Py construct. These results are in good agreement with the findings of host chromosome replication monitored by thymidine incorporation, i.e. mutant 544 was fully active but mutants 517 and 455 were inactive in response to hGM-CSF (6Watanabe S. Muto A. Yokota T. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 983-992Google Scholar). Using CAT gene as the reporter, we then examined whether or not mIL-3 or hGM-CSF would stimulate transcription through PEA3/PEBP5, the ets binding site of Py enhancer in the absence of pRSV-LTag. BA/F3 cells transiently transfected with 10-μg derivatives of pPyOICAT containing various enhancer elements and 2 μg each of hGMR α and β subunits plasmids (3Watanabe S. Muto A. Mui A.-F. Miyajima A. Arai K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1440-1448Google Scholar) were depleted of mIL-3 for 5 h and were re-stimulated with 5 ng of either mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. Cells were harvested after a 12-h incubation, as described under “Materials and Methods.” IL-3 induced fold induction of each construct in BA/F3 cells is shown in Fig. 5 A. Transcription (%) activities normalized using the value of pPyWACAT are summarized in the right column of each construct (Fig. 3 A). Essentially the same results were obtained by hGM-CSF stimulation. mIL-3- or hGM-CSF-induced CAT activity of pPyWACAT and this activity was lost by introduction of mutations in the PEA3/PEBP5 site (pPyM3ACAT). Mutations in either the PEA1/PEBP1 site (pPyM1ACAT) or PEA2/PEBP2 site (pPyM2ACAT) reduced CAT activities to some extent but not completely. CAT activity of pPyALCAT induced by mIL-3 or hGM-CSF was more than 10 times stronger than that of pPyWACAT. This may be caused by pPyALCAT containing 6 tandem copies of the PEA3/PEBP5 site. pPyALMCAT that contains point mutations in the AL region lost the potential to respond to mIL-3 or hGM-CSF. These results indicated that PEA3/PEBP5 is also functional as an enhancer responding to mIL-3 or hGM-CSF signals. Weak activity of pPyWACAT suggests that the PEA3/PEBP5 site in single copy is insufficient for activation or that other regions affect the PEA3/PEBP5 region in a negative manner. We then analyzed the ability of hGMR β mutants to induce CAT activity of pPyALCAT in response to hGM-CSF by cotransfection of various GMR β mutants plasmids (35Sakamaki K. Miyajima I. Kitamura T. Miyajima A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3541-3550Google Scholar) and reporter plasmid pPyALCAT (Fig. 5 B). hGM-CSF stimulated CAT activity through mutant 826 (data not shown) and mutant 763 in response to hGM-CSF at levels similar to the wild type construct. In contrast, mutants 626 and 544 failed to transduce signals to induce CAT activity of pPyALCAT even though these mutant receptors can induce replication of the same Py construct in response to hGM-CSF. As expected, mutants 517 and 455 did not activate CAT activity or the replication of pPyALCAT. Essentially the same results were obtained with BA/F3GMRβ mutants cells (data not shown). Thus, the region between positions 455 and 517 of the hGMR β subunit is required for the replication induced by hGM-CSF, and that between positions 763 and 626 is required for the transcriptional activation of pPyALCAT. It should be noted that the latter region corresponds to that required for c- fos/c- jun mRNA induct"
