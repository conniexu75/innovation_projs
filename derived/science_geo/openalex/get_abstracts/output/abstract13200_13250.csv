https://openalex.org/W2161229567,"Human epidermal keratinocytes grow from single cells into stratified colonies. Cells in the upper layers of the colonies lose their ability to divide and begin terminal differentiation. In this process, there develops a cornified cell envelope that remains insoluble after heating in solutions of sodium dodecylsulfate and beta-mercaptoethanol. The insolubility of the cornified envelope depends upon proteins, since after treatment with proteolytic enzymes, the envelope becomes soluble in the detergent. Cells with cornified envelopes can be identified under the light microscope either in living colonies or following fixation and silver nitrate staining. Keratinocytes of the basal layer move in a characteristic way, but cornified cells do not move at all and form an immobile upper layer in the colonies. Keratinocytes disaggregated from growing colonies are of differing size and density, and can be separated on isopycnic gradients of Ficoll. The DNA-synthesizing cells are small (mean diameter 14 mum). The nonmultiplying cells are large and have a protein content proportionate to their size. Their final diameter may exceed 30 microns (volume increase greater than 10 fold). Cornified envelopes are found in some of the large cells but in none of the small. In growing colonies, usually 5-10% of the cells have cornified envelopes. The fraction is reduced in colonies growing in the presence of epidermal growth factor. Strain XB, an established keratinocyte line of mouse teratomal origin, also forms cornified envelopes, but the kinetics of the process are different, indicating that the program of terminal differentiation is not initiated at corresponding times in the two cell types."

All ten salts of metal carcinogens decreased the fidelity of DNA synthesis. Of the three metals which beforehand were considered to be possible mutagens or carcinogens, only one decreased fidelity. In contrast, 17 noncarcinogenic metal salts did not affect fidelity even when present at concentrations that were clearly inhibitory."

After the melatonin-filled capsules were removed, the period of the circadian rhythm of activity lengthened in rhythmic birds and normal rhythmicity was restored in continuously active birds. The results suggest that melatonin is involved in the physiological control of circadian rhythmicity in sparrows."
https://openalex.org/W1964717161,"A system has been developed with clones of mouse myeloid leukemic cells in culture to study the induction of synthesis and secretion of lysozyme in relation to other steps in myeloid cell differentiation. Lysozyme was initially absent in all the clones studied. The different clones can be divided into three types according to their ability to be induced to undergo normal cell differentiation by the protein inducer MGI (macrophage and granulocyte inducer). One type of clone that can be induced by MGI to form Fc and C3 receptors and differentiate to mature macrophages and granulocytes (MGI+D+) was also induced by MGI to synthesize and secrete lysozyme. Lysozyme was induced after Fc and C3 receptors, and labeling with 35S-methionine has shown that the induced lysozyme was newly synthesized. MGI+D+ clones were also induced to synthesize and secrete lysozyme by dexamethasone, prednisolone, cytosine arabinoside, or thymidine and in one of four clones by dimethylsulfoxide but not by sodium butyrate. Inhibition of cell multiplication by itself was not sufficient to induce lysozyme synthesis. A second type of clone which can be induced by MGI to form Fc and C3 receptors but not mature cells (MGI+D−) was more weakly inducible by MGI for lysozyme and was not inducible by any of the other compounds. A third type of clone (MGI−D−) is not inducible by MGI for receptors or mature cells. One of four MGI−D− clones was induced to synthesize but not secrete lysozyme by dexamethasone together with sodium butyrate, but there was no lysozyme induction by MGI or any of the other compounds separately. The different clones maintained their different properties for at least 6 months in culture. The results indicate that clones with different hereditary blocks in the ability to be induced to differentiate by specific compounds can be used to dissect the process of myeloid cell differentiation, that the sequence of differentiation is induction of Fc and C3 receptors→lysozyme→mature cells, and that there are separate controls for these developmental steps."

https://openalex.org/W1999347022,"A rabbit antiserum monospecific for the internal structural protein p30 of Moloney murine leukemia virus (M-MuLV) was prepared to immunoprecipitate the polyribosomes synthesizing this protein in producer cells. The antiserum was monospecific for p30 protein as judged by immunodiffusion analysis against purified p30 and total virus protein. In addition, it could specifically precipitate p30 from total virus protein in the presence of cell extracts. Less than 1% of the M-MuLV-specific messenger RNA (mRNA) could be precipitated from purified producer cell polyribosomes when the anti-p30 was used in conjunction with sheep anti-rabbit antiserum. However, considerably more virus-specific mRNA was precipitated when the anti-p30 was used in conjunction with inactivated Staphylococcus aureus, which has binding sites for the antibody. Conditions were obtained where approximately 7% of the virus-specific mRNA in purified polyribosomes was recovered by immunoprecipitation, while normal serum precipitated 10 fold less. The virus-specific mRNA in the immunoprecipitated polyribosomes was 30S–35S in size."

https://openalex.org/W2104076492,"Human metaphase chromosomes, fixed in methanol-acetic acid, were ultraviolet irradiated to produce single-stranded regions of chromosomal DNA and treated with anti-5-methylcytidine. Using an immunoperoxidase procedure, regions of antibody binding were readily visualized by light microscopy in the centromeric heterochromatin regions of chromosomes 1, 9, 16, the short arm of chromosome 15, and in the distal portion of the Y. Electron microscopic visualization of the same whole mount chromosome preparations transferred to formvar-coated grids revealed additional details of the distribution and arrangement of 5-methylcytosine. A helical arrangement of 5-methylcytosine residues was seen below the centromere of chromosome 1. The Y chromosome showed a concentration of 5-methylcytosine residues on the distal long arm, and in areas just below and slightly above the centromere. In all the above chromosomes, especially chromosome 15, additional 5-methylcytosine residues were detected as isolated foci along the arms. Our findings support the concept that clusters of similar purine or pyrimidine residues exist along the arms of condensed metaphase chromosomes, with the possibility that concentrations of 5-methylcytosine residues might have been enhanced at the surface of the chromosomes during the condensation process."

https://openalex.org/W2086270776,"Replication intermediates of adenovirus DNA apparently contain extensive stretches of single-stranded DNA. Such single-stranded viral DNA sequences homologous to different regions of the viral genome present in adenovirus-infected cells during viral DNA replication have therefore been characterized by hybridization to the separated strands of restriction endonuclease fragments of 32P-labeled adenovirus types 2 and 5 DNA. Saturation hybridization experiments with infected cell DNA extracted at late times suggest that all regions of the adenovirus genome are represented in the single-stranded fraction, but at unequal frequencies. This nonuniform representation has been characterized in more detail with self-annealed, total cell DNA extracted 18 hr after adenovirus type 2 infection: the concentration of single-stranded sequences homologous to different regions of the viral genome was determined by comparing the rates of hybridization of 32P-labeled, single-stranded DNA probes with such self-annealed 18 hr DNA to the rates of hybridization of the same probes with equal concentrations of their complements. This approach allows the concentration of single-stranded viral DNA sequences in excess of their complements to be determined. Such sequences can be represented by two concentration gradients across the viral genome: those homologous to the r strand increase in concentration from 27.8–40.9 units toward the right end, whereas sequences homologous to the I strand increase from an area 27.8–40.9 units toward the left end. The time course of synthesis of single-stranded viral DNA sequences relative to accumulation of total viral DNA during the productive cycle and their behavior following a shift of H5ts125-infected cells in which viral DNA replication has begun from a permissive to a nonpermissive temperature support the contention that these sequences are indeed generated as adenovirus DNA is replicated. These results are therefore discussed in terms of current models of adenovirus DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2073677764,"The developmental program for beta-galactosidase in C57BL/6J and related strains of mice differs from that seen in most other mouse strains. Mice of the C57BL/6 group show a rise in liver enzyme activity during development that is not seen in mice of other strains. The developmental pattern of beta-galactosidase activity in heart and brain of C57BL/6 mice is similar to that in other strains. Physical, kinetic, and immunological tests indicate that the developmental increase in C57BL/6 enzyme activity is an increase in the number of molecules of the same species of enzyme protein that is present in other strains. In genetic crosses, the presence of the developmental rise in liver enzyme activity segregates as if determined by a single genetic factor showing additive expression in heterozygotes. This factor is closely linked to the beta-galactosidase structural gene on chromosome 9. The existence of a genetic variant with these properties is evidence that programmatic information capable of regulating the temporal expression of a structural gene can be encoded in DNA."

https://openalex.org/W2147313546,"Sea urchin embryo mRNAs of three distinct classes--histone mRNA, nonhistone mRNA containing poly(A), ""[+A] mRNA,"" and nonhistone mRNA lacking poly(A), ""[-A]mRNA""--all contain blocked 5' terminal sequences in which 7-methylguanosine is linked 5'-5' via a triphosphate bridge to a 2'-0-methylated nucleotide. Only one general type of 5' terminal structure, 7mGpppXmpYp, is present. Additional 2'-0-methylation in the Y residue has not been found either in early or late stage embryos. A substantial proportion of the polyribosomal mRNAs in all three classes contain this blocked structure. Whereas both classes of nonhistone mRNAs have internal base methylations, histone mRNAs lack such modifications."

https://openalex.org/W1964344716,"Lethal mutations in the T region of chromosome 17 in the mouse cause death at specific stages of embryonic development. It is widely believed that death of homozygous mutant embryos occurs as a result of aberrant cell-cell interaction followed by disorganization and death of specific cell types within the embryo. In vitro culture of blastocysts homozygous for one of these mutations, tw5, has revealed that this mutation is lethal for all cells of the mutant embryo. In addition, measurements of β-glucuronidase activity indicate that the lethal period of the tw5 mutation is the same in vitro as it is in vivo. Similar biochemical studies with t12 mutant embryos demonstrate that cessation of macromolecular synthesis occurs rather abruptly at the morula stage, the time at which those mutant embryos die in vivo. These results lead us to propose that all cells within the conceptus are directly and profoundly affected by early acting t mutations, and that failure of some cell types to organize properly is not an adequate explanation of the death of these mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2089337451,"Ultraviolet irradiation of cultured murine cells damages chromosomal DNA, thus causing premature termination of synthesis of hnRNA chains. We have utilized this effect for measuring the sizes of transcription units for the various classes of hnRNA. Target size analyses of the loss of synthesis of hnRNA species suggest that hnRNA, through its entire size range, constitutes mostly primary transcripts-that is, the shorter RNA molecules are not processed from longer precursors. Polyadenylated hnRNA appears to be a primary transcript as well. Our data, however, are also consistent with processing of precursors to poly(A)+ hnRNA from the 5'termini of larger hnRNA molecules. They are not consistent with models which postulate that poly(A)+ hnRNA sequences originate at the 3' termini of precursors which are considerably larger (greater than 30%) than the polyadenylated hnRNA molecules themselves. Finally, we have found that the process of polyadenylation is not measurably affected by ultraviolet irradiation of cells."

https://openalex.org/W1970901890,"We developed a procedure, using the toxic lysine analog S-2-aminoethyl-L-cysteine (thialysine) as the selective agent, to obtain mutant Chinese hamster lung (CHL) fibroblasts with temperature-sensitive defects affecting protein synthesis. The procedure is efficient, rapid, and simple. Using this selective system, we isolated six temperature-sensitive mutants that fail to grow (plating efficiencies <10−5) and synthesize protein at 39°C. The temperature-sensitive phenotype of five of the six mutants is suppressed in vivo by exogenous asparagine. In the mutant studied in the greatest detail, asparagyl-tRNA synthetase activity is extremely thermolabile in vitro. Asparagine-suppressible, temperature-sensitive mutants are induced at a high frequency by the mutagen ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), and they can be efficiently recovered using the proper selective conditions. Our results suggest that CHL cells have only one functional copy of the gene encoding for asparagyl-tRNA synthetase."

https://openalex.org/W2020215281,"We have examined the poly(A)- and poly(A)+ polyribosomal (Ps) RNAs of developing sea urchin embryos to see whether they contain the capped structures previously observed in the poly(A)+ cytoplasmic RNA (mRNA) of a variety of eucaryotic organisms. We have found that both classes of Ps RNA contain 7-methylguanosine linked to the RNA by a 5'-5' triphosphate bridge. Capped structures derived from either class of Ps RNA appear to be of the type m7G5'ppp5'NmpNp, with only a single sugar-methylated nucleoside per cap, and we have estimated that both classes of Ps RNA are capped to the same extent. The 5' terminal 2'-0-methylated nucleosides have been identified and quantitated. The relative amounts are Am = 78%, Gm = 14%, Cm = 5%, Um = 3% for poly(A)- Ps RNA, and Am = 78%, Gm = 15%, Cm = 5%, Um = 2% for poly (A)+ Ps RNA. In addition, both classes of Ps RNA contain 2-4 internal residues of N6-methyladenylic acid per molecule."
