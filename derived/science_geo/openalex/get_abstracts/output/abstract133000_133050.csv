The coding strand of the survivin gene was extensively complementary to that of effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1), prompting the present investigation on the origin and functional relationship of these two transcripts. Southern blots of genomic DNA were consistent with the presence of multiple, evolutionarily conserved, EPR-1/Survivin-related genes. By pulsed field gel electrophoresis and single- and two-color fluorescence in situ hybridization, these were contained within a contiguous physical interval of 75–130 kilobases (kb) on chromosome 17q25. In Northern blots, a single strand-specific probe identified a 1.3-kb EPR-1 mRNA broadly distributed in normal adult and fetal tissues, structurally distinct from the 1.9-kb Survivin transcript expressed in transformed cell lines. Transient co-transfection of an EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense with a lacZ reporter plasmid resulted in loss of viability of HeLa cells. In contrast, co-transfection of an antisense cDNA of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 or a sense-oriented Survivin cDNA was without effect. In stably transfected HeLa cells, ZnSO4 induction of an EPR-1 mRNA under the control of a metallothionein promoter suppressed the expression of endogenous survivin. This resulted in (i) increased apoptosis as detected by analysis of DNA content and in situ internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and (ii) inhibition of cell proliferation as compared with induced vector control transfectants. These findings suggest the existence of a potential EPR-1/survivin gene cluster and identify survivin as a new target for disrupting cell viability pathways in cancer.

Regulated inhibition of programmed cell death (apoptosis) preserves normal homeostasis and tissue and organ morphogenesis (1Nagata S.

Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). A novel member of the IAP gene family, designated Survivin (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), was recently identified by hybridization screening of human genomic libraries with the cDNA of a factor Xa receptor, effector cell protease receptor-1 (EPR-1) (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). 1The abbreviations used are: EPR-1, effector cell protease receptor-1; kb, kilobase(s); nt, nucleotide(s). Unlike all other IAP proteins (4Clem R.J. Duckett C.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 337-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), Survivin contained a single baculovirus IAP repeat and no RING finger and was selectively expressed during development and in all the most common human cancers but not in normal adult tissues in vivo (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, the Survivin coding strand was extensively complementary to that of EPR-1, thus suggesting a potential functional interaction between these two transcripts (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). In this study, we sought to dissect the molecular relationship between EPR-1 and Survivin (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar, 13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and its role in apoptosis inhibition. We found that EPR-1 and Survivin are encoded by structurally and topographically distinct messages potentially originating from a gene cluster at 17q25. Secondly, down-regulation of Survivin by forced expression of EPR-1 increased apoptosis and inhibited growth of transformed cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized blood collected from normal informed volunteers by differential centrifugation on Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 400 × g for 22 °C and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. The epithelial carcinoma HeLa cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD) and maintained in culture in complete growth medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (BioWhittaker) and 2 mml-glutamine, according to the manufacturer's specifications. For fluorescence in situ hybridization, purified DNA from a Survivin P1 genomic clone (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) was labeled with digoxigenin dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by nick translation, combined with sheared human DNA, and hybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes derived from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, and 2× SSC. For two-color staining, biotin-conjugated probe D17Z1, specific for the centromere of chromosome 17, was co-hybridized with the digoxigenin-labeled P1 clone. Specific chromosomal staining was detected by fluoresceinated anti-digoxigenin antibodies and Texas red avidin. Slides were counterstained with propidium iodide or DAPI for one- or two-color labeling, respectively. A total of 80 metaphase cells were analyzed with 69 cells exhibiting specific labeling. Human genomic DNA was extracted from HeLa cells, digested with EcoRI, BamHI,XbaI, or HindIII, separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and transferred to GeneScreen nylon membranes (NEN Life Science Products). After UV cross-linking (Stratagene, San Diego, CA), the membrane was prehybridized with 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) in 5× SSC, 0.5% SDS, 5× Denhardt's solution, and 0.1% sodium pyrophosphate at 65 °C in a roller hybridization oven (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Hybridization was carried out with gel-purified (GeneClean Bio101, Vista, CA), [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) random-primed labeled (Boehringer Mannheim) 1.6-kb EPR-1 cDNA (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) for 16 h at 65 °C. After two washes in 2× SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C, and 0.2× SSC at 22 °C, radioactive bands were visualized by autoradiography using a Kodak X-Omat AR x-ray film and intensifying screens (DuPont). In other experiments, cultured lymphoblastoid cells were embedded in low melting preparative agarose (Bio-Rad) at the concentration of 2 × 106/220 μl block, and DNA was extracted by standard procedures. After block digestion with MluI or NotI, samples were separated by pulsed field gel electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel for 20 h at 200 V with a pulse time of 75 s using a Bio-Rad CHEF DRII apparatus. After transfer to nylon membranes and UV cross-linking, hybridization with the EPR-1 cDNA and washes were carried out as described. In another series of experiments, a blot containing aliquots of genomic DNA isolated from several species (CLONTECH, San Francisco, CA) was hybridized with a 3′ 548-nt fragment of the EPR-1 cDNA, as described above. Multiple tissue blots of adult and fetal mRNA (CLONTECH) were prehybridized with 100 μg/ml of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Promega) and hybridized with an EPR-1-single strand-specific probe (see below) in 5× SSPE, 10× Denhardt's, 2% SDS, for 14 h at 60 °C. The membranes were washed twice in 2× SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C and once in 0.2× SSC at 22 °C before exposure for autoradiography. An EPR-1-specific single strand probe was generated by asymmetric polymerase chain reaction amplification of a 301-nt fragment of the EPR-1 cDNA generated by EcoRI (cloning site) andSacII digest and comprising the first 5′ 226 nt of the EPR-1 coding sequence plus 75 nt of the retained regulatory intron (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The gel-purified fragment was mixed with 15 pmol dNTP (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), 7.5 pmol of dCTP, and 25 μCi of [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris HCl, 50 mm KCl, pH 8.4, 1.5 mm MgCl2, plus 0.2 μg/μl of a SacII reverse EPR-1 primer 5′TGCTGGCCGCTCCTCCCTC3′ and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Science) in a total volume of 10 μl. 25 cycles of amplification were carried out with denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 52 °C for 1 min, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min. After centrifugation through a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) at 14,000 × g for 5 min, the EPR-1 or Survivin probes were heated at 100 °C for 2 min and immediately added to the various hybridization reactions. A control antisense construct of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of the full-length human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 cDNA (14Simmons D. Makgoba M.W. Seed B. Nature. 1988; 331: 624-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides 5′-GATCTAGACTCGCTATGGCTCCCAGC-3′ and 5′-CCGCAAGCTTTCAGGGAGGCGTGGCTTG-3′ containingXbaI and HindIII restriction sites, respectively (underlined sequences). The amplified product of 1605 nt was gel purified and directionally cloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for transfection in HeLa cells. A 708-ntSmaI-EcoRI fragment of the EPR-1 cDNA (nt 379–1087) (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), potentially acting as a Survivin antisense, and a sense-oriented Survivin construct (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) were also used for these experiments. Subconfluent cultures of HeLa cells in 6-well tissue culture plates were cotransfected with 1 μg of lacZ reporter plasmid and 4 μg of the various sense- and antisense-oriented constructs or the empty pcDNA3 vector using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). 48 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde for 1 h and stained for β-galactosidase expression with 0.5 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, and 2 mm MgCl2 in phosphate-buffered saline. The blue cells were counted and scored on an inverted microscope. In another series of experiments, HeLa cells (1 × 107) were transfected with 10 μg of control pcDNA3 vector alone or the survivin antisense cDNA plus 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA by electroporation (Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad) with a single electric pulse at 350 V at 960 microfarads. 48 h after transfection, HeLa cells were collected by trypsinization, pooled with nonattached cells, and fixed in 70% ethanol on ice for 30 min. Fixed cells were pelletted by centrifugation and suspended in 10 μg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.05% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After a 45-min incubation at 22 °C, samples were analyzed for DNA content by flow cytometry using a FACScan (Becton Dickinson). The 708-nt SmaI-EcoRI fragment of the EPR-1 cDNA (see above) was directionally cloned in the sense orientation in the mammalian cell expression vector pML1 (a gift of Dr. R. Pytela, University of California, San Francisco). The vector is derived from the episomal mammalian expression vector pCEP4 by replacing the cytomegalovirus promoter cassette with the mMT1 promoter, directing Zn2+-dependent expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells (15Lukashev M.E. Sheppard D. Pytela R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18311-18314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 10 million HeLa cells were transfected with 10 μg of control pcDNA3 vector or the Survivin antisense by electroporation as described above. 48 h after transfection, cells were diluted, plated onto 100-mm diameter tissue culture dishes, and selected for 4 weeks in complete growth medium containing 0.4 mg/ml hygromycin. Modulation of survivin expression in control cultures or Zn2+-induced antisense transfectants was carried by immunoblotting of detergent-solubilized cell extracts using 25 μg/ml aliquots of the affinity-purified antibody raised against the survivin sequence Ala3–Ile19, as described (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). In control experiments, Zn2+-induced vector control or survivin antisense transfectants were analyzed for modulation of Class I major histocompatibility complex by flow cytometry with monoclonal antibody W6/32. Vector control or Survivin antisense transfectants were treated with 200 μm ZnSO4in 0% fetal bovine serum for 24 h at 37 °C following byin situ determination of apoptosis by internucleosomal DNA fragmentation (TUNEL). Briefly, cells were harvested and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the pellet was fixed in 10% formalin overnight, dehydrated, and embedded in paraffin blocks, and sections of 3–5 μm were put on high adhesive slides. Samples were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K for 15 min at 22 °C, washed in distilled water, quenched of endogenous peroxidase in 2% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline, and subsequently mixed with digoxigenin-labeled dUTP in the presence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody. Nuclear staining in apoptotic cells was detected by 3′, 3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride dihydrate, according to the manufacturer's instructions (ApopTag, Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD). For control experiments, the enzyme incubation step was omitted. Morphologic features of apoptotic cells (apoptotic bodies) under the various conditions tested were also analyzed by hematoxylin/eosin staining. For proliferation experiments, vector control or Survivin antisense transfectants at 2 × 104/well were plated in 24-well tissue culture plates (Costar) and induced with 200 μm ZnSO4 in complete growth medium for 16 h at 37 °C, and cell proliferation was determined microscopically at 24 h intervals by direct cell count. Two independent clones of HeLa cell transfectants were used in these experiments with comparable results. In some experiments, analysis of DNA content in induced vector control or Survivin antisense transfectants in complete growth medium was carried out by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry, as described above. A digoxigenin-labeled P1 genomic clone (∼100 kb) containing all four exons of the survivin gene (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) specifically labeled a single region on the long arm of a group E chromosome by fluorescencein situ hybridization (Fig. 1 A). In two-color staining with probe D17Z1 specific for the centromere of chromosome 17, the Survivin P1 clone reacted with the long arm of chromosome 17 with band 17q25 (Fig. 1, A and B). Probing human genomic DNA with the EPR-1 cDNA revealed several hybridizing bands (Fig. 2 A). Of these, a ∼7.5-kb XbaI, a 7.6-kb BamHI, and four HindIII fragments of ∼15, 7.5, 6.4, and 3.7 kb, respectively (Fig. 2 A, arrowheads), were not predicted from the complete restriction map of 14,796 nt of thesurvivin gene (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). In contrast, other bands of comparable intensity, including a 5.1-kb XbaI and a 7.1-kbBamHI fragment, or of stronger intensity, including fragments of 17.5-kb HindIII, 10.5-kb XbaI, 8.5-kb BamHI, and ∼25-kb EcoRI (Fig. 2 A), genuinely originated from the survivin gene (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). At variance with this complex hybridization pattern, pulsed field gel electrophoresis of high molecular mass human genomic DNA revealed only single EPR-1-hybridizing bands of ∼75 and ∼130 kb inMluI- or NotI-digested samples, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Finally, the EPR-1 cDNA strongly hybridized with several bands in genomic DNA from various mammalian species, with fainter signals in rabbit or chicken DNA (Fig. 2 C). Consistent with the size of the spliced EPR-1 message (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a single strand EPR-1-specific probe detected a prominent ∼1.3-kb EPR-1 mRNA band in most adult and terminally differentiated human tissues (Fig. 3,upper panel). Strong EPR-1 expression was observed in human pancreas, skeletal muscle, heart, and various hematopoietic cell types, including peripheral blood leukocytes, lymph node, and spleen (Fig. 3,upper panel). Consistent with the reactivity of an anti-EPR-1 antibody with fetal tissues (16Adida C. Crotty P.L. McGrath J. Berrebi D. Diebold J. Altieri D.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar), a 1.3-kb EPR-1 mRNA was also found prominently in fetal kidney and liver and less abundantly in fetal lung and brain (Fig. 3, lower panel). Control hybridization with an actin probe confirmed comparable loading of mRNA in the various fetal samples (Fig. 3). In contrast, a Survivin-specific single strand probe did not react with mRNA isolated from normal adult tissues (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), whereas it detected a prominent ∼1.9-kb transcript plus a fainter 3.4-kb species in various transformed cell lines (not shown) and in agreement with previous observations (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Transient co-transfection of HeLa cells with an EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense plus alacZ reporter plasmid produced significant loss of viability in β-galactosidase-expressing cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, co-transfection of pcDNA3 vector alone, a sense-oriented Survivin construct, or a control antisense of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 cDNA did not affect HeLa cell viability under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 4). To determine more precisely the effect of regulated expression of EPR-1 on Survivin inhibition of apoptosis, HeLa cells were stably transfected with an EPR-1 cDNA under the control of an metallothionein-inducible promoter. In these experiments, ZnSO4 induction of EPR-1 mRNA suppressed the expression of endogenous Survivin, as determined by immunoblotting with an anti-Survivin antibody (Fig. 5 A). In contrast and consistent with the expression of Survivin in transformed cell types, a single 16.5-kDa Survivin band was immunoblotted in metallothionein-induced HeLa cells transfected with the pML1 vector alone (Fig. 5 A). In control experiments, metallothionein induction of EPR-1 mRNA did not affect the expression of Class I major histocompatibility complex molecules in HeLa cell transfectants, and no modulation of Survivin expression was observed in the absence of ZnSO4 (not shown). Under these experimental conditions, antisense down-regulation of Survivin resulted in massive apoptosis in growth factor-deprived HeLa cells, as detected by in situinternucleosomal DNA fragmentation by the TUNEL system (Fig. 5 B, panel 1). Specific nuclear staining was observed in 60–70% of metallothionein-induced, serum-starved HeLa cell transfectants, whereas induced vector control cultures did not stain with the digoxigenin-labeled dUTP probe (Fig. 5 B,panel 3). No staining was observed in the absence of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase labeling (not shown). Hematoxylin/eosin staining confirmed the presence of numerous apoptotic bodies in ZnSO4-induced Survivin antisense transfectants, as compared with vector control HeLa cells (Fig. 5 B,panels 2 and 4, arrowheads). The effect of antisense down-regulation of Survivin on HeLa cell proliferation was also investigated. As shown in Fig. 6 A, suppression of endogenous Survivin resulted in significant inhibition of cell proliferation, as compared with induced vector control cultures (Fig. 6 A). 3 days after metallothionein induction, the number of vector control HeLa cell transfectants increased by 288% during optimal serum mitogen stimulation, as opposed to a 20% increase in Survivin antisense transfectants, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 6 A). The increased cell proliferation observed at later time intervals (days 4–5) in induced antisense transfectants may reflect heterogeneity in antisense expression with selective expansion of low expressing cells (Fig. 6 A). The potential ability of Survivin to modulate apoptosis and cell proliferation under optimal concentrations of serum mitogens was further investigated. Analysis of DNA content in transiently transfected HeLa cells revealed a ∼2-fold increase in the fraction of apoptotic cells (sub-G1 peak) in Survivin antisense transfectants as compared with vector control cells, under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 6 B,M1 marker). This was also associated with a ∼15–20% decrease in the G2/M fraction in Survivin antisense transfectants, as compared with vector control cultures (Fig. 6 B, M4 marker). In stable HeLa cell transfectants, zinc induction of Survivin antisense under optimal growth conditions produced a ∼1.4-fold increase in the sub-G1 fraction and a ∼20–36% reduction in the G2/M peak, as compared with induced vector control cultures (n = 2).Figure 5Effect of metallothionein induction of EPR-1 mRNA on Survivin expression and apoptosis. A, aliquots of HeLa cells stably transfected with the empty pML1 vector (Vector) or the EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense (Antisense) were induced with 200 μm ZnSO4, detergent-solubilized, and immunoblotted with the anti-survivin antibody.

The M1 marker contains the sub-G1 apoptotic fraction (18.2% in Survivin antisense transfectants versus 9.6% in vector control cells), whereas the M4 marker contains the proliferating G2/M fraction (18% in Survivin antisense transfectants versus21% in vector control cells).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we have shown that EPR-1 (13Altieri D.C. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 860-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and Survivin (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat.

Secondly, constitutive or metallothionein induction of EPR-1, potentially acting as a Survivin antisense, down-regulated endogenous Survivin in transformed cells and resulted in increased apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation, even in the presence of optimal serum mitogen concentrations. Among the regulators of programmed cell death (apoptosis), IAP proteins have recently attracted considerable attention for their ability to suppress an evolutionarily conserved step in apoptosis (4Clem R.J. Duckett C.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 337-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), potentially involving direct caspase inhibition (11Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar). Deregulation of this pathway may also participate in human diseases, because inactivating mutations of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein contributed to spinal muscular atrophy (9Roy N. Mahadevan M.S. McLean M. Shutler G. Yaraghi Z. Farahani R. Baird S. Besner-Johnston A. Lefebvre C. Kang X. Salith M. Aubry H. Tamai K. Guan X. Ioannou P. Crawford T.O. de Jong P.J. Surh L. Ikeda J.-E. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A. Cell. 1995; 80: 167-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), and this molecule was cytoprotective against cerebral ischemia in vivo (17Xu D.G. Crocker S.J. Doucet J.-P. St-Jean M. Tamai K. Hakim A.M. Ikeda J.-E. Liston P. Thompson C.S. Korneluk R.G. MacKenzie A. Robertson G.S. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). More recently, this paradigm has been extended to cancer, with the identification of Survivin as a structurally unique IAP protein selectively expressed during development and in all the most common human cancers but not in normal adult tissues in vivo (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, thesurvivin gene was identified by hybridization with the EPR-1 cDNA, and its coding sequence was found to be extensively complementary to that of EPR-1 (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), suggesting the possibility of apoptosis regulation by a potential interaction between these two transcripts, i.e. natural antisense (18Kimmelman D. Kischner M.W. Cell. 1989; 59: 687-696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 19Farrell C.M. Lukens L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3400-3408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Celano P. Berchtold C.M. Kizer D.L. Weeraratna A. Nelkin B.D. Baylin S.B. Casero Jr., R.A. J. Biol.

Here, Southern blots of human genomic DNA were consistent with the presence of multiple, evolutionarily conserved, EPR-1/Survivin-related genes, with several hybridizing fragments that could not be recapitulated by the complete physical map of 14,796 nt of thesurvivin gene (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Despite this complex hybridization pattern, pulsed field gel electrophoresis and fluorescence in situ hybridization studies suggested the existence of a single EPR-1/Survivin locus spanning 75–130 kb on chromosome 17q25. Although mammalian genes transcribed in both directions have been described (22Adelman J.P. Bond C.T. Douglass J. Herbert E. Science. 1987; 235: 1514-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar,23Kindy M.S. McCormack J.E. Buckler A.J. Levine R.A. Sonenshein G.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2857-2862Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), these data are more consistent with a model of separate genes encoding EPR-1 and Survivin, potentially arisen from duplication event(s) and clustered in relatively close proximity at 17q25 in a head-to-head configuration (24Graham G.J. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 175: 71-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The use of single strand-specific probes further demonstrated that EPR-1 and Survivin originated from two structurally different messages of 1.3 and 1.9 kb, respectively, expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion in adult and fetal tissues (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar, 16Adida C. Crotty P.L. McGrath J. Berrebi D. Diebold J. Altieri D.C. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 43-49PubMed Google Scholar). This is consistent with the heterogeneity of EPR-1 transcripts detected by conventional, double strand probes with hybridizing bands of 1.9, 3.4, and ∼1.5 kb previously identified in EPR-1+ cells (25Nicholson A.C. Nachman R.L. Altieri D.C. Summers B.D. Ruf W. Edgington T.S. Hajjar D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28407-28413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Although it is currently not known if these two messages actually interact in vivo, we found that metallothionein induction of an EPR-1 mRNA suppressed the expression of endogenous Survivin in transfected cells. Consistent with the anti-apoptosis properties of Survivin (12Ambrosini G. Adida C. Altieri D.C. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar), this resulted in increased apoptosis and significant inhibition of cell proliferation. Although accentuated by serum mitogen withdrawal, HeLa cell apoptosis following antisense down-regulation of Survivin was also observed under optimal growth conditions and was associated with a reduced number of proliferating cells in the G2/M fraction. In these experiments, the use of a noncoding EPR-1 cDNA potentially acting as a Survivin antisense ruled out the possibility that inhibition of Survivin was due to protein interactions. It is also unlikely that ZnSO4 induction of the metallothionein promoter may exert an independent anti-apoptotic function, because this has been attributed to ZnCl2, at concentrations 5–10-fold higher than those used here (26Newmeyer D.D. Farschon D.M. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 353-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The findings described here may have profound implications for cancer therapy, where antisense-based strategies have been postulated for inhibition of several proto-oncogenes (27Henry S.P. Monteith D. Levin A.A. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar). Specifically, antisense blockade of anti-apoptotic bcl-2 decreased survival of leukemic cells in vitro (28Campos L. Sabido O. Rouault J.P. Guyotat D. Blood. 1994; 84: 595-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), reduced tumorigenicity of lymphoma cells in athymic mice (29Reed J.C. Cuddy M. Haldar S. Croce C. Nowell P. Makover D. Bradley K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3660-3664Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), and provided, at least in some cases, a positive therapeutic response in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (30Webb A. Cunningham D. Cotter F. Clarke P.A. di Stefano F. Ross P. Corbo M. Dziewanowska Z. Lancet. 1997; 349: 1137-1141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). In this context and consistent with the data presented here, targeting Survivin may selectively increase the susceptibility of cancer cells to apoptosis-based treatment and reduce their overall growth potential. In addition to inhibiting cell viability pathways distinct and complementary with those of bcl-2 (11Deveraux Q.L. Takahashi R. Salvesen G.S. Reed J. Nature. 1997; 388: 300-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), suppression of Survivin by an endogenous EPR-1 transcript potentially acting as a natural antisense may overcome the drawbacks of limited specificity and insufficient delivery commonly observed with antisense oligonucleotides (27Henry S.P. Monteith D. Levin A.A. Anti-Cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 395-408PubMed Google Scholar). Elucidation of the mechanisms regulating Survivin and EPR-1 gene expression should further facilitate the selective disruption of this novel anti-apoptosis pathway in cancer without affecting viability of normal tissues.

It is not known, however, if and how these components are connected. We have previously reported that GSH inhibits, in vitro, the neutral magnesium-dependent sphingomyelinase (N-SMase) from Molt-4 leukemia cells. In this study, GSH was found to reversibly inhibit the N-SMase from human mammary carcinoma MCF7 cells. Treatment of MCF7 cells with TNFα induced a marked decrease in the level of cellular GSH, which was accompanied by hydrolysis of sphingomyelin and generation of ceramide. Pretreatment of cells with GSH, GSH-methylester, or N-acetylcysteine, a precursor of GSH biosynthesis, inhibited the TNFα-induced sphingomyelin hydrolysis and ceramide generation as well as cell death. Furthermore, no significant changes in GSH levels were observed in MCF7 cells treated with either bacterial SMase or ceramide, and GSH did not protect cells from death induced by ceramide. Taken together, these results show that GSH depletion occurs upstream of activation of N-SMase in the TNFα signaling pathway.TNFα has been shown to activate at least two groups of caspases involved in the initiation and “execution” phases of apoptosis. Therefore, additional studies were conducted to determine the relationship of GSH and the death proteases. Evidence is provided to demonstrate that depletion of GSH is dependent on activity of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases but is upstream of the site of action of Bcl-2 and of the execution phase caspases. Taken together, these studies demonstrate a critical role for GSH in TNFα action and in connecting major components in the pathways leading to cell death.

Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is an essential and closely regulated process important in the development and maintenance of multicellular organisms (1Wyllie A.H. Kerr J.F.R. Currie A.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1992; 68: 251-306Crossref Scopus (6728) Google Scholar). Inducers of apoptosis include cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, and stress conditions. Intracellular mediators of apoptosis include proteases of the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme/Ced-3 family (2Alnemri E.S. Livingston D.J. Nicholson D.W. Salvesen G. Thornberry N.A. Yuan J.

Recently, it has been proposed that TNFα exerts its death signal through a series of protein domain-domain interactions; the cytoplasmic segment of TNFα receptor 1 binds to TRADD, which in turn associates with FADD, and the latter is thought to interact with MACH/FLICE (caspase-8) (3Hu S.

Neuroscience. 1992; 48: 903-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that depletion of GSH is a relatively early event in the commitment to apoptosis (10Macho A. Hirsch T. Marzo I. Marchetti P. Dallaporta B. Susin S. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4612-4619PubMed Google Scholar). However, how this transmits cytotoxic signals remains to be answered. Ceramide, the product of cytokine-activated and sphingomyelinase (SMase)-catalyzed hydrolysis of sphingomyelin (SM), is an important regulator of apoptosis (21Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolak L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). SM is one of the most abundant sphingolipid species in cell membrane with important structural and functional properties (22Hakomori S. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1993; 21: 583-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 23Hakomori S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 733-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). Activation of SMases is believed to be involved in cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis induced by cytokines, chemotherapeutic agents, and ionizing radiation (24Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1500) Google Scholar). To date, five types of SMase have been described, and they differ in subcellular location, pH optimum, cation dependence, and role in cell regulation (25Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The lysosomal acid SMase has been cloned, and this enzyme is activated in cells exposed to radiation (26Haimovitz-Friedman A.

Relatively little is known about the biological relevance of the other three SMases, namely the zinc-dependent and lysosomal acid SMase-derived acid enzyme (34Spence M.W. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B.

Chem. 1994; 269: 4070-4077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the alkaline SMase (37Nyberg L. Duan R.D. Axelson J. Nilsson A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We have observed that the N-SMase from the human acute lymphoblastic leukemic Molt-4 cells is inhibited in vitro by GSH (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This suggested to us that N-SMase may be a direct target for transmitting at least some of the effects of GSH depletion. In the current study, we report that GSH inhibits the TNFα-induced activation of N-SMase in MCF7 cells, and depletion of GSH induced by TNFα involves activity of a cow pox virus cytokine modifier protein (cytokine response modifier A; CrmA)-sensitive interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like protease but not Bcl-2. The implications of our results in bridging the fields of oxidative stress and sphingolipid signaling are discussed. MCF7 cells (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M.

For cells transfected by Bcl-2 and its vector, hygromycin (150 μg/ml, Calbiochem) was included in the medium, and for cells transfected by CrmA and its vector, Geneticin (500 μg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) was used. For treatment, cells were normally seeded at 5 × 105 cells/10-cm culture dish (Falcon) in 10 ml of complete medium and grown for 48 h to 50–75% confluence. Prior to the initiation of treatment, cells were rested in fresh complete medium without the selection antibiotic but with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. GSH was made as a 200 mm stock solution in RPMI and added to cells 2 h before the addition of TNFα. Unless otherwise indicated, the vector control cell line for the Bcl-2-transfected MCF7 cells was used and designated as MCF7 cells. TNFα was a gift from Dr. Phil Pekana (East Carolina University, Greenville, NC). [3H]choline chloride was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. GSH methyl ester and YVAD were from BACHEM (Torrance, CA). GSH and all other reagents were obtained from Sigma. MCF7 cells grown to near confluence in 175-cm2 flasks were harvested by trypsinization, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pelleted by centrifugation, frozen in a methanol-dry ice bath, and stored at −80 °C until use. To obtain N-SMase, detergent-solubilized membrane proteins were prepared from homogenate from pooled cell pellets (2 × 109 cells) and resolved on a DEAE-Sepharose column (1 × 10 cm) connected to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC system essentially as described (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), except that both buffers A and B contained Triton X-100 (0.005%, w/v). N-SMase was efficiently resolved from A-SMase in MCF7 cells (25Liu B. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 8: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) by the detergent extraction step and DEAE column, such that the final N-SMase preparation contained <1% of A-SMase activity under the assay conditions. The activity of N-SMase was determined using a mixed micelle assay system as described (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained enzyme preparation in 100 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm magnesium chloride in a final volume of 100 μl. Cells grown in 10-cm Petri dishes were rinsed with ice-cold PBS and scraped into methanol. Cell lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (31Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y.

Then cells were switched to fresh complete medium containing [3H]choline (1 μCi/ml). After 48 h, cells were switched again to fresh medium and chased for 2 h before treatment with GSH and/or TNFα as described above. The level of SM was determined following a protocol essentially as described (40Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at 2 × 105 in 6-cm Petri dishes in 4 ml of complete medium. Two days later, cells were treated with the desired agents as described above. Treated cells were detached by trypsinization, washed (three times) with ice-cold PBS, and solubilized in 150 μl of water. 5-Sulfosalicylic acid was added to a final concentration of 2%, and the supernatant was separated from the acid-precipitated proteins by centrifugation. GSH content in the supernatant was determined by the Griffith (41Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 106: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (4060) Google Scholar) modification of the Tietze's enzymatic procedure (42Tietze F. Anal.

Protein content was determined by the dye binding assay using bovine serum albumin as standard (43Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217546) Google Scholar). Cells were scraped into medium, pelleted by centrifugation, and washed (one time) with ice-cold PBS containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS-phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and solubilized in 2× SDS sample buffer. Western blot for PARP was performed as described (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K.

The survival of cells was determined with the WST-1 cell proliferation reagent from Boehringer Mannheim. Cells were seeded at 103 cells/well/200 μl of complete medium in a 96-well culture plate. Two days later, cells were treated in quadruplicate with TNFα as described above. At the end of treatment, WST-1 reagent was added, and after a 3-h incubation period the absorbance was measured at 450 nm with a multiwell plate reader as recommended by the manufacturer. Previously, we found that GSH inhibited in vitro the N-SMase from Molt-4 leukemic cells (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). To study the role of GSH in TNFα signaling, we chose the human mammary carcinoma cell line MCF7, which is very sensitive to TNFα (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). We partially purified N-SMase from MCF7 cells following the procedure described for rat brain (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and tested the effects of GSH on N-SMase in vitro. When the enzyme was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with 1–20 mm GSH followed by incubation with substrate for 30 min, a dose-dependent inhibition of N-SMase by GSH was observed with a greater than 95% inhibition observed with 3 mm of GSH (Fig. 1 A). Preliminary experiments established that with the minimum preincubation time examined (1 min), GSH (3 mm) inhibited the enzyme activity by >80% (data not shown). The inhibition was specific for GSH, since two other small thiol-containing molecules, dithiothreitol (DTT) and β-mercaptoethanol, at concentrations up to 20 mm, were ineffective (Fig. 1 A), and co-incubation of GSH with 5 or 20 mm DTT did not alter the inhibitory profile for GSH (Fig. 1 B). When the N-SMase/GSH (4 mm) mixture was diluted by 3- or 5-fold, enzyme activity was recovered by 70 and 95%, respectively, suggesting that the inhibition was reversible (Fig. 1 C). GSH did not inhibit the acidic SMase (38Liu B. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16281-16287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), although both the N-SMase and acidic SMase have been suggested to be activated in cells treated with TNFα (29Jayadev S. Hayter H.L. Andrieu N. Gamard C.J. Liu B. Balu R. Hayakawa M. Ito F. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17196-17203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 33Wiegmann K. Schütze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Krönke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that physiologic levels of GSH (3–10 mm) totally inhibit N-SMase. The results also suggest that the sharp drop in cellular levels of GSH may relieve this inhibition and cause activation of N-SMase. To investigate the effect of GSH on N-SMase in TNFα signaling, MCF7 cells were treated with TNFα (3 nm) for 2–24 h, and GSH levels were measured. As shown in Fig. 2 A, TNFα treatment resulted in an initial sharp drop in the level of GSH followed by a steady further decrease, with the first significant decrease observed at 8 h post-treatment. The most dramatic change in the level of GSH occurred between 8 and 10 h after TNFα treatment, where the GSH level plunged to nearly a third of that of control cells at the 10-h time point. GSH levels then steadily decreased to 7% of control cells by 24 h (Fig. 2 A). At the 10-h time point, cells treated with TNFα did not manifest any detectable sign of apoptosis. In particular, proteolysis of the “cell death substrate” poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (45Kaufmann S. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5870-5878PubMed Google Scholar) was only detected at 12–24 h (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The TNFα-induced decrease in cellular GSH level was accompanied by an increase in the level of ceramide, with an initial significant rise observed at the 8–12-h time points. Ceramide levels at 12 h after TNFα treatment were twice control levels and reached more than 6-fold the control levels at 24 h (Fig. 2 B). When the effect of TNFα on cellular SM level was examined, significant SM hydrolysis was observed between 10 and 16 h, and a 30% hydrolysis of SM was detected at 14 h (Fig. 2 C). These kinetics raise the possibility that GSH may be involved in the regulation of SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation in cells treated with TNFα. Since GSH inhibited N-SMase in vitro at physiologically relevant concentrations and changes of GSH levels induced by TNFα preceded ceramide accumulation and SM hydrolysis, we next investigated the effects of manipulating intracellular GSH levels on TNFα-induced SM hydrolysis and ceramide generation. First, replenishment of intracellular GSH by the addition of 10 mm GSH to the culture medium prior to TNFα treatment (3 nm; 14 h) completely prevented the TNFα-induced SM hydrolysis (Fig. 3 A). Treatment of cells with GSH (10 mm) alone had no effect on SM levels. Second, GSH pretreatment significantly inhibited the accumulation of ceramide induced by TNFα (Fig. 3 B). A nearly complete inhibition of ceramide increase was observed at 12 h after TNFα treatment (Fig. 3 B). At 16 and 24 h, ceramide accumulation induced by TNFα was inhibited by about 50%. Third, in addition to GSH, significant inhibition of TNFα-induced ceramide accumulation was also achieved by treatment of cells with GSH methylester andN-acetylcysteine (NAC), which is converted intracellularly to cysteine, a precursor of GSH biosynthesis (Fig. 3 C). These results further support the notion that GSH levels regulate the activity of N-SMase in these cells. The partial protection observed with exogenous GSH may be explained by the fact that the addition of GSH, GSH-ME, or NAC could not completely restore the intracellular GSH levels in cells treated with TNFα. As shown in Fig. 3 D, pretreatment of cells with 20 mm GSH, GSH-ME, or NAC prior to a treatment with 3 nm TNFα for 16 h only brought the intracellular GSH levels from 14.5% to 52.8, 64.7, or 57.9% of that of control cells, respectively. Next, the biological consequences of changes in GSH levels in response to TNFα were studied by examination of cell death and survival. Whereas TNFα induced significant cell death, as determined by the ability of cells to exclude trypan blue dye, partial rescue of cells was achieved by replenishment of intracellular GSH with GSH added to the cell culture medium. Preincubation of cells with 10 and 15 mm GSH for 2 h prior to treatment with TNFα lowered TNFα-induced cell death from 58.5% to 35.5 and 26.5%, respectively (Fig. 4 A). The effect of TNFα on the viability of MCF7 cells was also determined using the WST-1 assay, which measures the activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain in viable cells. TNFα significantly reduced the survival of MCF7 cells, and a 50% reduction in survival was observed when cells were treated with 1 nm TNFα for 24 h (Fig. 4 B). Inclusion of 10 mm GSH enhanced the survival of TNFα-treated cells to 75–95% of control level (Fig. 4 B). Mechanistically, the effects of TNFα on PARP cleavage, a close marker of the apoptotic response, were evaluated. TNFα-induced cleavage of PARP was partially inhibited by GSH and NAC in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 C). Since PARP is a substrate for “execution” phase proteases such as CPP32/caspase-3 (46MacFarlane M. Cain K. Sun X.M. Alnemri E.S. Cohen G.M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 469-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 47Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar), these results place GSH upstream of these proteases in the pathways leading to cell death. The hypothesis that GSH levels regulate the activity of N-SMase in response to TNFα suggests that the product ceramide should function downstream of GSH and that it probably would not alter the cellular level of GSH. Bacterial SMases are known to induce a fast and significant elevation of intracellular ceramide by hydrolysis of membrane sphingomyelin (44Zhang P. Liu B. Jenkins G.M. Hannun Y.A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9609-9612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 48Jarvis W.D. Kolesnick R.N. Fornari F.A. Traylor R.S. Gewirtz D.A. Grant S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). However, when MCF7 cells were treated with 300 milliunits/ml of bacterial SMase from Staphylococcus aureus or Bacillus cereus for up to 24 h, no significant alteration in GSH levels was observed (Fig. 5 A). Similarly, treatment of cells with 2.5–10 μm of the cell-permeable short chain C6-ceramide for up to 48 h did not induce significant reduction in the GSH level (Fig. 5 B), although exogenous ceramide at these concentrations caused apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 5 C, Ref. 39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Conversely, pretreatment of cells with 10 mm GSH prior to ceramide treatment did not protect cells from death induced by ceramide (Fig. 5 C), in sharp contrast to the ability of GSH to inhibit the hydrolysis of SM and ceramide accumulation induced by TNFα. Finally, preincubation of cells with the inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis,l-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine (BSO), for 24 h did not render the cells more sensitive to death induced by C6-ceramide (Fig. 5 D). The GSH level in the cells treated with 100 μm BSO for 24 h was 14.1 ± 1.3% of that of the control cells. These results place GSH upstream of N-SMase activation in the TNFα signaling pathway. TNFα-induced accumulation of ceramide has been shown to be inhibited by CrmA but not by Bcl-2 (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), placing activation of SMases downstream of CrmA-inhibitable proteases and upstream of Bcl-2 inhibitable proteases. To investigate the relationship between CrmA and GSH, MCF7 cells transfected with CrmA or empty vector were treated with TNFα, and GSH levels were determined. No significant changes in GSH levels were observed in CrmA-transfected cells treated with 3 nmTNFα over a time period ranging from 1 to 24 h, whereas a time-dependent depletion of GSH was observed in the vector-transfected cells (Fig. 6 A). The TNFα-induced depletion of GSH was also inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the substrate-based tetrapeptide inhibitor of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases, YVAD (49Margolin N. Raybuck S.A. Wilson K.P. Chen W. Fox T. Gu Y. Livingston D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7223-7228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of MCF7 cells with 50 μm YVAD prior to TNFα (3 nm) brought the GSH level from 20% of control to 80% of control (Fig. 6 B). These results clearly demonstrate that the drop in GSH in response to TNFα is dependent upon activation of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases (such as caspase-8/FLICE). Next, the effects of TNFα on the GSH levels in Bcl-2-transfected MCF7 cells were examined following treatment with 1–10 nmTNFα for 14 h. In both the Bcl-2- and vector-transfected cells, TNFα, at a dose as low as 1 nm, caused a drop in GSH levels to 45% of that of untreated control cells (Fig. 7). Concentrations of TNFα greater than 1 nm and up to 20 nm further decreased the GSH level to 20–30% of the control value. These results show that the drop in GSH levels is not downstream of the site of action of Bcl-2. Finally, the interrelation of GSH, Bcl-2, CrmA, and TNFα-induced hydrolysis of SM was investigated. When SM levels were analyzed in CrmA- and Bcl-2-transfected cells, Bcl-2 had no effect on TNFα-induced SM hydrolysis, and this SM hydrolysis in Bcl-2 cells was inhibited by pretreatment with GSH (Fig. 8). Cells with CrmA, however, were completely resistant to TNFα-induced SM hydrolysis (Fig. 8). Thus, similar to the drop in GSH, activation of N-SMase is downstream of the site of action of CrmA and most probably upstream of the site of action of Bcl-2. Our current study implicates GSH in regulation of a number of TNFα-induced processes. Specifically, we show that TNFα causes a dramatic depletion of GSH, which is closely related to regulation of neutral sphingomyelinase and activation of proteases. We show that GSH inhibits N-SMase in vitro and provide evidence for regulation of N-SMase in cells. Replenishment of GSH prevents hydrolysis of SM and offers partial protection against TNFα-induced generation of ceramide, PARP proteolysis, and cell death. Importantly, activation of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases, those that are inhibited by CrmA or YVAD, is implicated in the depletion of GSH. On the other hand, Bcl-2 does not modulate GSH depletion. Since Bcl-2 inhibits activation of the CPP32 family of proteases (Group II; Ref. 68Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 30-38Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2187) Google Scholar) and since GSH plays a role in regulating proteolysis of PARP, the best studied substrate of this group, these results suggest that GSH depletion, SM hydrolysis, and ceramide accumulation (39Dbaibo G.S. Perry D.K. Gamard C.J. Platt R. Poirier G.G. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 50Zhang J. Alter N. Reed J.C. Borner C. Obeid L.M.

An important implication of this study is the prediction that those agents that cause GSH depletion will also cause activation of N-SMase as a direct consequence of this depletion, which would relieve the enzyme from inhibition by GSH. Ceramide generated through this mechanism would connect GSH depletion to a number of downstream targets known to be modulated by ceramide, such as caspase 3/CPP32 (58Perry D.P. Smyth M.J. Wang H-G.

First, how does the activation of CrmA- and YVAD-inhibitable proteases result in depletion of GSH? Second, although this study identifies N-SMase as a direct target regulated by GSH, it is conceivable that the drop in GSH will affect other direct targets that may “communicate” additional messages in response to this drop. Third, although the results suggest an important role for GSH in regulating N-SMase with complete inhibition of SM hydrolysis by GSH, the effects on ceramide levels are incomplete. This raises the possibility that ceramide is regulated by additional pathways not involving N-SMase, such as the acidic SMase or ceramide synthase, each of which has been implicated in ceramide formation (33Wiegmann K.

Finally, GSH repletion did not reverse in full the effects of TNFα on PARP proteolysis or on cell death, suggesting that additional mechanisms are involved. In conclusion, these results seem to connect important regulators in TNFα-induced cell death. They provide for a direct target, N-SMase, that detects changes in the level of GSH, which may be of generalized significance in connecting oxidative damage with sphingolipid signaling."

Alternatively spliced forms of VEGF are found in vivo that range in length from 121 to 206 residues (7Leung D.W. Cachianes G. Kuang W.-J. Goeddel D.V. Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (4396) Google Scholar, 8Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The NH2-terminal 110 residues of the most prevalent form of VEGF, VEGF1–165, codes for the receptor-binding domain, whereas the next 55 residues code for a heparin-binding domain. We have recently solved the x-ray crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of VEGF (VEGF8–109 which contains residues 8 to 109) and provided a high resolution functional map of the binding site for KDR by alanine-scanning mutagenesis (9Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. De Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Here, we characterize the functional requirements for binding and signaling between VEGF1–109 and KDR. Mutational and biophysical studies show that two molecules of KDR dimerize across the subunit interface of the VEGF and initiate signaling. Deletion experiments in KDR show that IgG-like domains 2–3 are sufficient for tight binding and domains 4–7 are not essential for signaling. Based upon these studies we have produced a VEGF analog that antagonizes the action of native VEGF. These studies provide a basis for developing antagonists and mimics of VEGF and should apply to other members of the cystine-knot family of hormones and their receptors. The plasmid pHEBO23 containing the cDNA coding for the KDR extracellular domain was fused to cDNA encoding amino acids 216–443 of the human heavy chain IgG (10Park J.E. Chen H.H. Winer J. Houck K.A. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25646-25654Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A Genenase 1 site (Ala-Ala-His-Tyr) was put in between the KDR and the IgG by Kunkle mutagenesis (11Kunkle T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4881) Google Scholar). To generate KDR deletion mutants, aKpnI restriction site was put at the junction of each domain by Kunkle mutagenesis. Various deletion mutants were constructed by cutting at a unique ClaI site outside of the 5′ end of the gene and the KpnI at each junction. Qiagen columns were used to purify DNA to transiently transfect into the human kidney 293 cell line. KDR-IgG mutants were expressed in 4-day conditioned serum-free media in a quantity ranging from 100 to 400 μg/15-cm diameter dish. Proteins were purified by protein A affinity chromatography and quantified by their UV absorption at 280 nm and total amino acid hydrolysis. Constructs containing KDR 1–5, 1–4, 1–3, 1–2, and 2–3 correspond to amino acids 1–552, 1–424, 1–335, 1–222, and 1–335 (with 24–116 deleted), respectively. Residues 1–19 constitute the signal sequence based on NH2-terminal analysis of the secreted protein, KDR 1–7. To generate monomers of KDR domain 1–7 or KDR 1–3, the corresponding IgG fusion was incubated with 20:1 molar ratio of fusion protein to Genenase 1 in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 2 mNaCl for 4 h at room temperature (12Chamow S.M. Ashkenazi A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 52-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The mixture was then passed through a protein A column to capture the digested IgG portion and any incompletely digested fusion protein. The digested protein was further purified on a gel filtration column, Superdex 200 (Pharmacia), to remove Genenase 1 and some protein aggregates. For large scale production of KDR monomer, the KDR 1–7 and 1–3 IgG fusion with Genenase cut site were cloned into plasmid for stable dihydrofolate reductase-Chinese Hamster cells expression (13Lucas B.K. Giere L.M. DeMarco R.A. Shen A. Chisholm V. Crowley C.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1774-1779Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). For the stoichiometry studies, proteins were characterized for purity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography and quantified by total amino acids acid hydrolysis. Different ratios of KDR with VEGF8–109 or the corresponding heterodimer containing one intact binding site (hV-1) was incubated at room temperature for 2 h before injecting onto the Superdex 200 column. For KDR 1–3, one column was used. For KDR 1–7, two columns were used in tandem. KDR-IgG fusions or KDR monomers were incubated with 125I-VEGF1–165 (ICN, DuPont) and increasing concentrations of VEGF variants for 18 h at room temperature in 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.15 n NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The mixture was transferred to a 96-well plate coated with anti-Fc antibody for KDR-IgG assays or MAKD5 for KDR monomer assays and allowed 15 min to capture the complex. The plate was then washed and counted in Topcount Microplate Scintillation counter (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). Biotinylated VEGF1–109 was used as tracer for some assays and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated strepavidin was added at the end. The concentration of receptor and 125I-VEGF1–165or biotinylated VEGF1–109 were adjusted so that they were at least a factor of four below the estimatedK d . For mAb binding assays, KDR-IgG was captured on the rabbit anti-human Fc antibody Fab (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory Inc., West Grove, PA) coated 96-well plate. Serial dilutions of mAbs were put in the plate and allowed to bind for 2 h and the plates washed thoroughly with incubation buffer. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Fab antibody was added which had been preabsorbed with human Fc. The purification and refolding of VEGF1–109 and VEGF8–109 was performed as described in Muller et al. (9Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. De Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The refolding of the VEGF1–109 heterodimer was performed essentially as described by Potgens and co-workers (14Potgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF with the C51S/I46A/I83A mutations and VEGF1–109 with C60S/F17A/E64A mutations were purified separately fromEscherichia coli. The variants were mixed and unfolded with 6 m guanidine HCl plus 1 mm oxidized glutathione at pH 6, and dialyzed against 10 volumes of 2 murea with 2 mm reduced glutathione and 0.5 mmof oxidized glutathione in 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 8 for 18 h. Urea was removed by dialyzing slowly against 20 volumes of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) overnight at 4 °C. The covalently linked heterodimer was finally purified by FPLC (Pharmacia) on a Mono Q anion exchange column and the identity confirmed by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry. The KDR 1–7 or KDR 1–3 was fused to residue 768 of Flt-4 (1–1363) so that the fusion contains the transmembrane (residues 776–800) and full intracellular domain of Flt-4 in a similar fashion as the CSF-1R-Flt-4 fusion described by Pajusola et al. (20Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Pelicci G. Weich H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with the purified plasmid containing the fusion and one-tenth molar of NEO (G418)-resistant plasmid by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (15Graham F.L. Van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6464) Google Scholar) and selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) first 200 μg/ml, later 500 μg/ml. The NEO control cells were given the NEO plasmid. The cells were cloned by limited dilution and selected for their response to VEGF in the [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. The positive clones were maintained with Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium/F-12 media with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. For 3T3 cells transfected with KDR 1–7 or KDR 1–3 fused to the Flt-4 transmembrane and intracellular domains, 2000 cells were plated in each well of the 96-well dishes and fasted with Dulbecco's modified minimal essential F-12 media supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 48 h. Cells were then treated with VEGF8–109 or VEGF variants for 18 h and pulsed with 0.5 μCi/well of [3H]thymidine (Amersham) for 6 h and harvested and counted with Topcount Microplate Scintillation counter (Packard). For assays with HuVEC cells (purchased from Cell System, Kirkland, WA), cells were passed from 2–5 times. Cells were maintained in complete growth media (Cell System) on dishes coated with attachment factors (Cell System). Cells were seeded in coated 96-well plates (4000 cells per well) and fasted in Dulbecco's modified minimal essential F-12 media with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 24 h. VEGF and variants were added in fresh fasting media and incubated for 18 h. Cells were pulsed with [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/well) for 6 h, harvested, and counted with Topcount. Single alanine mutations that disrupt binding to VEGF1–109 map to the poles of the dimer (Fig. 1). From these mutagenesis data alone one cannot distinguish if KDR binds across the subunit-subunit interface or if each KDR binds entirely to one subunit (Fig. 2 A). To evaluate these models for binding we produced two mutated forms of VEGF: a monomeric form and a heterodimer in which one pole was mutated to obliterate receptor binding. Monomeric VEGF1–109 was produced by substituting with arginine the two cysteine residues (Cys-51 and Cys-60) that are responsible for the intermolecular disulfides. The C51R/C60R double mutant was purified and shown to be monomeric by native gel filtration and SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions (data not shown). The fact that the monomeric VEGF bound equally well as the wild type VEGF to an anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody suggests that its structure was largely intact; mutational studies show this epitope is discontinuous and therefore requires proper folding of VEGF for binding to occur. 2B. Li, unpublished data. The monomer was unable to compete with wild type VEGF1–109(K d ∼ 5 nm) for binding to KDR at concentrations approaching 1 μm (Fig. 2 B). However, at much higher concentrations, monomeric VEGF could displace wild-type VEGF with an approximate IC50 of ∼20 μm (Table II). Thus, although the monomer appears to be properly folded its binding affinity for KDR is reduced >1000-fold.Table IISummary of dissociation constants (K d ) for binding of monomeric and dimeric forms of VEGF and KDR 1–7VEGF1–109KDRMonomerDimerMonomer2-aData from Figs. 2 B and 4.

Open table in a new tab Variants of VEGF containing a single intermolecular disulfide bond were produced using a strategy reported by Potgens and co-workers (14Potgens A.J. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A C51S mutation was introduced into one subunit, and a C60S variant was produced in the other. C51S and C60S mutants were purified separately from E. coli and refolded together (see “Experimental Procedures”) and a heterodimer of VEGF containing two functional receptor binding sites (hV-2) was generated. The hV-2 heterodimer bound to KDR with virtually the same affinity as the wild-type dimer (Fig. 2 B) and was fully active in cell-based assays (data not shown). Thus, the heterodimer containing only one intersubunit disulfide bonds is functional and properly folded. The individual cysteine mutants taken through the same refolding procedure do not bind KDR (up to 10 μm in concentration (data not shown), presumably because they cannot form a proper homodimer. Next we produced single binding site heterodimers (hV-1) in which one pole on VEGF1–109 was mutated at residues shown by alanine scanning to be most important for binding KDR (Fig. 1). One subunit contained the C51S mutation plus I46A and I83A, and the other subunit had C60S along with F17A and E64A. The hV-1 heterodimer was generated as hV-2 and confirmed by mass spectrometry. The hV-1 bound to the KDR monomer only 2-fold weaker than VEGF8–109 (Fig. 2 B), indicating that it can still bind the receptor with one pole intact. These data combined with the fact that monomeric VEGF binds much weaker to KDR strongly support a model where each KDR binds across the subunit-subunit interface and not exclusively to one of the subunits (Fig. 2 A). To determine the minimal IgG-like domain requirements for binding of KDR to VEGF1–109, a series of deletions were produced in which each of the seven IgG-like domains were deleted from the carboxyl terminus of the extracellular domain. The deletion variants were expressed initially as dimeric proteins by fusion to the CH2-CH3 domain of an antibody (KDR-IgG). This was done to facilitate purification on a Protein A affinity column (12Chamow S.M. Ashkenazi A. Trends Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 52-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and to compare their affinities to monomeric forms of KDR. The choice of deletion junction was based on homology to other members of the IgG superfamily (16Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar, 17Finnerty H. Kelleher K. Morris G.E. Bean K. Merberg D.M. Kriz R. Morris J.C. Sookdeo H. Turner K.J. Wood C.R. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2293-2298PubMed Google Scholar). Systematic carboxyl-terminal domain deletions had virtually no effect on affinity for VEGF until IgG-like domain 3 was deleted (Table I); KDR 1–2 had an affinity that was >1000-fold reduced relative to KDR 1–3 but did show specific binding at concentrations above 2 μm(data not shown). A variant of KDR missing the first NH2-terminal domain, KDR 2–3, bound nearly as well as the full-length KDR (Table I). These data suggest that domains 2–3 are most important for high affinity binding.Table IAnalysis of deletions of the seven IgG-like domains in the extracellular domain of KDRK d (pm),1-aThe binding affinity of KDR variants to VEGF1–109 was measured using a competitive radioimmunoassay and 125I-VEGF1–165 (NEN Life Science Products Inc., DuPont) as a tracer except that the affinity for KDR 2–3-IgG was measured using biotinylated VEGF as tracer as described under “Experimental Procedures.” VEGF1–109EC50(nm)Non-blockingBlocking MAKD6MAKD1MAKD5KDR 1–7-IgG51 (±11)2.111.510.45KDR 1–5-IgG143 (±24)2.131.050.41KDR 1–4-IgG57 (±12)1.740.950.44KDR 1–3-IgG101 (±18)1.861.120.51KDR 1–2-IgG>100,0002.041.020.60KDR 2–3-IgG100ND1-bND, not detectable.ND1-bND, not detectable.0.50KDR1–7 monomer4990 (±700)1.891.590.64KDR1–3 monomer3350 (±1000)1.810.880.531-a The binding affinity of KDR variants to VEGF1–109 was measured using a competitive radioimmunoassay and 125I-VEGF1–165 (NEN Life Science Products Inc., DuPont) as a tracer except that the affinity for KDR 2–3-IgG was measured using biotinylated VEGF as tracer as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-b ND, not detectable. Open table in a new tab To determine if these deletions had caused misfolding of the molecules, we analyzed their binding to three different anti-KDR monoclonal antibodies (Table I), one of which (MAKD6) blocks binding of VEGF. The antibodies bound to nearly all the deletion variants with affinities virtually identical to the full-length KDR 1–7 (EC50 ∼1 nm). Deletion of domain 1 caused complete disruption for binding of the non-neutralizing antibodies (MAKD1 and MAKD5) but not the neutralizing antibody (MAKD6). Thus, the deletions do not grossly disrupt the structure of the molecules and locate the epitopes for MAKD1 and MAKD5 to domain 1 and for MAKD6 to domain 2. The fact that the antibody MAKD6, which blocks binding of VEGF, binds to domain 2 further supports the importance of domain 2 for binding VEGF. To facilitate preparation of monomeric forms of KDR, a Genenase 1 protease cleavage site (18Carter P. Wells J.A. Science. 1987; 24: 394-399Crossref Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was engineered at the junction of the last KDR IgG domain and the CH2 domain (19Beck J.T. Marsters S.A. Harris R.J. Carter P. Ashkenazi A. Chamow S.M. Mol. Immunol. 1994; 31: 1335-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The cleaved KDR was shown to be monomeric based on its mobility in nonreducing SDS-PAGE and gel filtration. Both the KDR 1–7 and KDR 1–3 monomers bound all three mAbs and equally well to VEGF (Table I). These results show the first three IgG-like domains are sufficient for binding of VEGF whether in monomeric or dimeric forms. To determine the stoichiometry of binding of VEGF1–109 to the extracellular domain of KDR, we systematically varied the ratio of VEGF to KDR and determined the apparent size of the complexes by gel filtration. The glycosylated monomeric KDR 1–7 migrated as a single peak by gel filtration chromatography with an apparent molecular mass of ∼250 kDa (Fig. 3 A). By comparison, the dimeric KDR 1–7-IgG migrated as a 600-kDa peak (data not shown). Upon addition of one equivalent of VEGF (dimer) per two equivalents of KDR (monomer), a single complex peak was formed of apparent molecular mass ∼400 kDa. A minor shoulder was seen that might represent the slight excess KDR monomer in the mixture. The fact that the 2:1 complex is smaller by gel filtration than expected from the sum of the component molecular masses (520 kDa) may be that VEGF aligns the receptor subunits in a more compact fashion. Further additions of 2 and 3 equivalents of VEGF did not change the position of the high molecular weight peak, and excess VEGF accumulated as the free dimeric hormone (Fig. 3 A). The height of the free VEGF peak was small because VEGF contains no tryptophan residues and therefore has a small molar absorbance at 280 nm. When the ratio of KDR to VEGF exceeded 2:1, free KDR 1–7 accumulated as a shoulder. The hV-1 heterodimeric variant of VEGF forms a 1:1 complex with monomeric KDR. This complex migrated at a position that was intermediate between the free KDR 1–7 and the 2:1 KDR·VEGF complex. When the ratio of the hV-1 to KDR 1–7 exceeded unity, the free heterodimer accumulated in the chromatogram. Parallel experiments were carried out with the monomeric form of KDR 1–3 (Fig. 3 B). When no VEGF was present, KDR 1–3 migrated as a single peak of apparent molecular mass of ∼70 kDa. Addition of 1 equivalent of VEGF dimer to 2 equivalent of KDR 1–3 resulted in forming a peak with apparent molecular mass of ∼160 kDa. Addition of 2 and 3 equivalents of VEGF did not change the position of the complex peak, but free VEGF accumulated. Increasing additions of KDR 1–3 in excess of the 2:1 ratio to VEGF dimer showed increasing appearance of free KDR 1–3. A similar set of experiments with the hV-1 showed it maximally formed a 1:1 complex (Fig. 3 B); when the ratio of either the variant or KDR 1–3 was skewed from unity, the free excess component accumulated. These experiments explicitly show that two molecules of KDR bind to one VEGF dimer, and that form of KDR lacking IgG-like domains 4–7 are capable of producing the 2:1 complex in solution. When VEGF is engineered to have only one functional binding site (hV-1) it cannot dimerize the receptor in vitro. Given the fact that the VEGF dimer binds two molecules of receptor we wished to determine to what extent predimerization of the receptor influenced affinity. This can be readily seen by comparing the binding constants for the monomeric and dimeric forms of KDR (Table I). KDR-IgG fusions containing domains 1–7 or 1–3 bound 50–100-fold stronger than their monomeric counterparts. The affinity of the single-site heterodimeric VEGF for binding to the dimeric KDR IgG fusion was about 200-fold weaker than wild-type VEGF (Fig. 4). In contrast, binding to monomeric KDR for the heterodimer was only 2-fold weaker than native VEGF (Fig. 2 B). These data, summarized in TableII, show that binding of dimeric VEGF to predimerized KDR is ∼100-fold stronger than when either the hormone or receptor contains a single binding site. Given the strong avidity component to binding of VEGF to its receptor, we wished to determine if VEGF binds the same way to monomeric and dimeric forms of KDR 1–7. We have previously reported the alanine scan of VEGF for binding to KDR-IgG (9Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. De Vos A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Here we analyze the binding of these same alanine mutants to monomeric KDR (TableIII). The data show that the same set of alanine mutants that are most disruptive for binding to KDR-IgG are also strongly disruptive to binding monomeric KDR.Table IIIThe comparison of the effect alanine mutants of VEGF 1–109 on binding to KDR 1–7-IgG or KDR1–7 monomerKDR-IgG dimerKDR monomerVEGF wt11F17A23091M18A1198E64A120460I43A′25120Y45A′140170I46A′4001000Q79A′100I83A′360810 Open table in a new tab There are some subtle and systematic differences in the way the alanine mutants bind the monomeric versus dimeric KDR. For example M18A, I43A, I46A, E64A, and I83A were more disruptive to affinity (by factors ranging from 2–8-fold) when tested against the monomericversus dimeric KDR. Only F17A was more disruptive to the dimer than the monomer (by ∼2-fold). The biased suppression of the disruptive effects of the alanine mutations when binding to the dimer is likely caused from avidity in binding. We conclude there are no gross differences in the way monomeric and dimeric forms of KDR bind to VEGF. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells that contain the extracellular domain of colony-stimulating factor receptor fused to the transmembrane and intracellular domain of the Flt-4 receptor incorporate [3H]thymidine and proliferate when treated with the colony-stimulating factor (20Pajusola K. Aprelikova O. Pelicci G. Weich H. Claesson-Welsh L. Alitalo K. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3545-3555PubMed Google Scholar). To produce a VEGF responsive cell line, we made a similar chimera in which the seven IgG-like domains of KDR were linked to the transmembrane and intracellular kinase domain of Flt-4. At low concentrations of VEGF this cell line incorporated [3H]thymidine with an EC50 of ∼100 pm (Fig. 5 A); high concentrations of VEGF (>1 μm) showed inhibition. Such a bell-shaped dose-response curve is anticipated for a two-site hormone dimerizing two identical receptors (21Fuh G. Cunningham B.C. Fukunaga R. Nagata S. Goeddel D.V. Wells J.A. Science. 1992; 256: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). The hV-1 was inactive (Fig. 5 A). A similar construct was produced in which only domains 1–3 of KDR were linked to Flt-4. These cells also incorporated [3H]thymidine in response to VEGF (Fig. 5 B) but did so with a higher EC50 (∼10 nm) and lower maximal response. We did not go to high enough concentrations to see inhibition by VEGF. The hV-1 was virtually inactive. Primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVEC) showed a bell-shaped dose-response curve (Fig. 5 C). We resist making quantitative comparisons between HuVEC and KDR expressed NIH 3T3 cells given the fact that the HuVEC contain both KDR and Flt-1 receptors (22Soker S. Fidder H. Neufeld G. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5761-5767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The difference in EC50 values and maximal response for the KDR 1–7 and KDR 1–3 cell lines likely resulted from the fact that the number of functional receptors on the KDR 1–3 cell line was at least 10-fold lower based upon binding of 125I-VEGF (data not shown). To explore the effect of receptor number on signaling directly we isolated three different clones of cells that varied over a range of 12-fold in the amount of the KDR 1–7 that specifically bound125I-VEGF (Fig. 6 A). The maximal levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation correlated with the number of receptors expressed on these cells and the EC50 values correlated inversely with the number of receptors (Fig. 6 B). It is interesting that the basal levels of [3H]thymidine incorporation correlated with the receptor number as well, suggesting that receptors can preassociate and signal weakly in the absence of exogenous VEGF. All of the transfectants containing the KDR 1–3 construct expressed much lower levels of receptors which may suggest that domains 4–7 are important for high level expression and display of the receptor. Given the ability of hV-1 to bind but not dimerize and activate KDR (Fig. 5), we studied its ability to antagonize signaling of KDR. Indeed the heterodimer antagonizes [3H]thymidine incorporation in the 3T3 cells transfected with the chimeric KDR (1Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R.

https://openalex.org/W2074058582,"We investigated the molecular species of sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants, the putative L-selectin ligand, expressed on high endothelial venules (HEV) in human lymph nodes. Comparison of the reactivity pattern of HEV with the reactivity of the pure 6-sulfo, 6′-sulfo, or 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X determinant with hitherto known anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies strongly suggested 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X to be the best candidate for the major sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinant on HEV, followed by 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, whereas 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X was unlikely. We newly generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) G152 and G72 directed against 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, which intensely labeled HEV in immunohistochemical examination and inhibited binding of recombinant L-selectin-IgG to HEV, suggesting that the determinant serves as a ligand for L-selectin. To test the concomitant expression of 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, specific mAbs (G2706, G27011, G27037, and G27039) were generated, but all antibodies failed to react to HEV. Next, we established mAbs (AG97 and AG273) directed against 6-sulfo Lewis X, the asialo form of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X. The antibodies were not reactive to untreated HEV, but strongly reacted to sialidase-treated HEV. This indicated the predominance of the sialylated form of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X and minimal expression of its asialo form, corroborating that it was synthesized by fucosyltransferase VII, the isoenzyme that preferentially produces the sialylated form of the determinant. We investigated the molecular species of sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants, the putative L-selectin ligand, expressed on high endothelial venules (HEV) in human lymph nodes. Comparison of the reactivity pattern of HEV with the reactivity of the pure 6-sulfo, 6′-sulfo, or 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X determinant with hitherto known anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies strongly suggested 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X to be the best candidate for the major sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinant on HEV, followed by 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, whereas 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X was unlikely. We newly generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) G152 and G72 directed against 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, which intensely labeled HEV in immunohistochemical examination and inhibited binding of recombinant L-selectin-IgG to HEV, suggesting that the determinant serves as a ligand for L-selectin. To test the concomitant expression of 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, specific mAbs (G2706, G27011, G27037, and G27039) were generated, but all antibodies failed to react to HEV. Next, we established mAbs (AG97 and AG273) directed against 6-sulfo Lewis X, the asialo form of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X. The antibodies were not reactive to untreated HEV, but strongly reacted to sialidase-treated HEV. This indicated the predominance of the sialylated form of 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X and minimal expression of its asialo form, corroborating that it was synthesized by fucosyltransferase VII, the isoenzyme that preferentially produces the sialylated form of the determinant. L-selectin (leukocyte endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1, leukocyte adhesion molecule-1, Mel-14 antigen) is expressed on human peripheral lymphocytes and is proposed to be involved in the homing of lymphocytes into peripheral lymph nodes (1Gallatin W.M.

The high endothelial venules (HEV) 1The abbreviations used are: HEV, high endothelial venule(s); ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BCECF-AM, 2′,7′-bis(carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester; PSGL-1, P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1. in peripheral lymph nodes are thought to express a carbohydrate ligand that binds to L-selectin. However, the nature of the L-selectin ligand expressed at the surface of HEV endothelial cells is not yet clear. Some sulfated carbohydrate determinants are known to bind to L-selectin or inhibit L-selectin-mediated cell adhesion. On the other hand, it was suggested that sialyl Lewis X and sialyl Lewis A have a significant capacity to bind L-selectin, despite the lack of a sulfate residue in their carbohydrate structures (4Foxall C.

However, most of the known anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies as well as anti-sialyl Lewis A antibodies did not react efficiently to HEV endothelial cells. In an earlier report, we showed that one of the anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies (2H5) specifically detected a sialyl Lewis X-like determinant on human HEV, and the antigenic determinant served as a ligand for L-selectin since the antibody inhibited the binding of lymphoid cells to human HEV endothelial cells in Stamper-Woodruff assays (11Sawada M. Takada A. Ohwaki I. Takahashi N. Tateno H. Sakamoto J. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We suggested that the antigenic determinant detected by the antibody was closely related, but not exactly identical, to genuine sialyl Lewis X and called it a complex-type sialyl Lewis X determinant, which was defined by the 2H5 antibody at that time (11Sawada M. Takada A. Ohwaki I. Takahashi N. Tateno H. Sakamoto J. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In studying the specificity of the known anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies, we noticed that they can be classified into two groups according to their cross-reactivity to sialyl Lewis X-related structures. One group consists of antibodies that recognize mainly sialic acid and fucose residues, but do not recognize the type 2 chain core Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ, whereas the other group contains antibodies that unerringly recognize sialic acid residues and type 2 chain core Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ structure, but only weakly recognize fucose residues (12Kannagi R. Kishimoto T. Leukocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1998: 352-355Google Scholar). The anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies that reacted to HEV were all found to belong to the former group, and the antibodies in the latter group lacked reactivity to HEV endothelial cells. These findings led us to assume that the complex sialyl Lewis X on HEV could be a sialyl Lewis X determinant that was somehow modified at the type 2 chain core structure. This modification would not affect the reactivity of the antibodies in the former group, but would seriously affect the reactivity of the antibodies in the latter group. The sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants, proposed by Hemmerich et al. (13Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) to be expressed on HEV in murine lymph nodes, were the sialyl Lewis X determinants modified by sulfate residues at the type 2 chain core structure. We thought one of these might be the complex sialyl Lewis X determinant that had been detected by our antibody on human HEV endothelial cells. In a previous study, we investigated the reactivity of a few anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies against human HEV and compared it with the reactivity pattern of the antibodies against a series of pure sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants (15Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa N. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230 (Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 233, 576): 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Our unexpected conclusion was that the best candidate for the molecular species carried by HEV is 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X (15Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa N. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230 (Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 233, 576): 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a conclusion quite different from those of preceding researchers, who suggested the 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X species to be a major determinant (13Hemmerich S.

In this paper, we expanded our studies and generated a series of new monoclonal antibodies directed against 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, and 6-sulfo Lewis X. By using these new reagents, we tried to establish 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X as the major sialyl Lewis X-like carbohydrate determinant carried by HEV endothelial cells, and the ligand carrying this capping structure serves as a ligand for L-selectin in human HEV. The anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies 2H5 (established against a mixture of complex sialyl Lewis X-active determinants prepared from human cancer cells) and 2F3 (established against the synthetic sialyl Lewis X glycolipid) were prepared as described previously (11Sawada M.

The anti-Lewis X antibody LeuM1 was purchased from Becton Dickinson Labware (Franklin Lakes, NJ); FH-2 was also a gift from Dr. S. Hakomori; and 73-30 and Tx-17 were established in our laboratory. The antibody SU59 directed against 3′-sulfo Lewis X was a gift from Dr. Akihiro Hino (Nisshin Shokuhin Co. Ltd., Otsu, Japan). These antibodies are all murine IgM, except for HECA-452, which is rat IgM. New hybridoma cells that secrete monoclonal antibodies directed against sulfated sialyl Lewis X and sulfated Lewis X determinants were generated according to the method described by Köhler and Milstein (21Köhler G. Milstein C. Nature. 1975; 256: 495-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (12783) Google Scholar) and subsequently adopted for anti-carbohydrate antibodies (22Kannagi R. Hakomori S. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.

Briefly, the synthetic 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, 6-sulfo Lewis X, or 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X glycolipid was adsorbed toSalmonella minnesota strain R595 and used for repeated intraperitoneal immunizations of BALB/c mice on day 0 (5 μg of glycolipid), day 3 (10 μg), day 7 (15 μg), day 12 (20 μg), day 17 (25 μg), and day 31 (35 μg). Three days after the final immunization, the spleen cells were harvested and fused with mouse myeloma P3/X63-Ag8U1. The same glycolipid was used as the antigen in solid-phase enzyme immunoassays of hybridoma culture supernatants for the cloning procedures. Two hybridoma clones (G152 and G72) were obtained by immunization of the 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X glycolipid, and four hybridoma clones (G2706, G27011, G27037, and G27039) were obtained by immunization of the 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X glycolipid. The antibodies AG97 and AG273 were obtained by immunization of the 6-sulfo Lewis X glycolipid. Monoclonal antibodies obtained in this study were all of the IgM class. ELISA was performed using glycolipid antigens immobilized at the bottom of 96-well culture plates by a standard method described previously (23Hakomori S. Kannagi R. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L.

Peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-rat IgM (μ-chain-specific; Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA) was used for HECA-452, and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM (μ-chain-specific; Cappel Inc., Malvern, PA) was used for the other antibodies. TLC immunostaining was performed according to the method described previously (23Hakomori S. Kannagi R. Weir D.M. Herzenberg L. Blackwell C. Herzenberg L.A.

The pure synthetic sialyl Lewis X glycolipid and the synthetic sulfated glycolipids (6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, and and 3′-sulfo Lewis X) used in this study were synthesized as described previously (25Kameyama A.

Open table in a new tab The oligosaccharide SL2L4 was a generous gift from Dr. Keiichi Yoshida (Seikagaku Kogyo, Tokyo, Japan) and was prepared from shark cartilage keratan sulfate by digestion with keratanase II (Bacillussp.; Seikagaku Kogyo), followed by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration. The oligosaccharide was coupled to cholesterylaniline through reductive amination (16Ohmori K. Takada A. Ohwaki I. Takahashi N. Furukawa Y. Maeda M. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi M. Kannagi R. Blood. 1993; 82: 2797-2805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by adding the aqueous solution of the oligosaccharide (200 μl of 5 mg/ml) to 2 ml of cholesterylaniline in pyridine (180 mg/ml) and incubating for 1 h at 80 °C in the presence of 1.0 mm AlCl3, followed by additional incubation for 1 h at 80 °C after adding 300 mg of dimethylamine-borane and 1 ml of acetic acid. AlCl3 was removed by Dowex 50W-X8 (100–200 mesh, H+ form) column chromatography from the product SL2L4-cholesterylaniline. Cholesterylaniline had been synthesized by adding 7.2 g of 1,4-p-phenylenediamine (Sigma) in 54 ml of Me2SO supplemented with 320 μl of pyridine to 1.8 g of cholesteryl chloroformate (Sigma) in 100 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane and incubating for 1 h at room temperature. Cholesterylaniline was recovered from the lower layer after the addition of 46 ml of methanol, 100 ml of 1,2-dichloroethane, and 200 of ml H2O. Consecutive frozen sections of 10-μm thickness were prepared from human axillary and mesenteric lymph nodes and other tissues and organs for immunohistochemical examination using anti-sialyl Lewis X and newly generated anti-sulfo sialyl Lewis X antibodies. The avidin-biotin complex technique for immunohistochemical study was performed as described in the instructions for the kits (Vectastain) provided by Vector Labs, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). When indicated, the sections were pretreated with sialidase from A. ureafaciens. For the binding assay of recombinant L-selectin-IgG chimera, frozen sections prepared from freshly obtained human lymph nodes were fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min. The sections were pretreated for 30 min at room temperature with phosphate-buffered saline containing 20% goat serum. To this, a mixture (1:1:1, v/v/v) of the recombinant human L-selectin-IgG chimera (20 μg/ml; kindly provided by Drs. H. Kondo and Y. Inoue, New Drug Research Labs, Kanebo Ltd., Osaka, Japan), affinity-purified biotinylated goat anti-human IgG antibody (30 μg/ml), and peroxidase-labeled avidin (30 μg/ml) was overlaid and incubated for 60 min at 4 °C. The reaction was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride, followed by after-staining with 1% methyl green. For the inhibition study, sections were incubated with anti-carbohydrate antibodies (50–100 μg/ml) for 120 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of the recombinant human L-selectin-IgG chimera/peroxidase mixture. A 96-well plate was coated with 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X by adding ethanol solution containing glycolipid (200 ng/well), egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (1 μg/well), and cholesterol (500 ng/well), followed by air-drying at 37 °C. After blocking with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C, the plate was incubated with appropriate inhibitor antibodies (40 μg/well) for 30 min at room temperature. BCECF-AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR)-labeled HULT-7 cells (2 × 105/well), the human L-selectin-transfected cells (15Mitsuoka C. Kawakami-Kimura N. Kasugai-Sawada M. Hiraiwa N. Toda K. Ishida H. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230 (Correction (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 233, 576): 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), were added and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The number of adherent cells was estimated by measuring fluorescence at 490 nm excitation and 530 nm emission on a fluorometer (Fluoroscan II, Labosystems, Tokyo). Endothelial cells of HEV in human peripheral lymph nodes were reactive to only a part of anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies as shown in Fig. 1 (a–f). The antibodies 2F3 and HECA-452 were strongly reactive to the HEV endothelial cells as well as the 2H5 antibody as reported previously (11Sawada M. Takada A. Ohwaki I. Takahashi N. Tateno H. Sakamoto J. Kannagi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 337-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The same pattern of staining was observed consistently with 14 different lymph node samples prepared from different individuals. This indicated that there are two groups of anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies: one group (2F3, 2H5, and HECA-452) of antibodies that stain HEV endothelial cells and another group (SNH-3, FH-6, and CSLEX-1) that are unable to do so. Reactivity of the 2F3, 2H5, and HECA-452 antibodies was eliminated when the sections were pretreated with sialidase (data not shown). These results suggest that the carbohydrate determinant(s) carried by HEV endothelial cells have sialylated structures closely related to sialyl Lewis X, but not genuine sialyl Lewis X, which would have been readily detected by all six anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies. HEV endothelial cells were not reactive to four anti-Lewis X antibodies, including LeuM1, FH-2, 73-30 and Tx-17 (in Fig. 1(g and h), the results obtained with 73-30 and Tx-17 were omitted since they were essentially the same as those obtained with FH-2 and LeuM1), before and after sialidase treatment. The only cells positively stained by all four antibodies were intravascular granulocytes. Staining of monocytes was prominent only with LeuM1. Upon sialidase treatment, the genuine sialyl Lewis X determinant ordinarily yields the Lewis X determinant, which is readily detected by these conventional anti-Lewis X antibodies. This finding again confirmed that the sialyl Lewis X-like determinant on HEV was not genuine sialyl Lewis X. The anti-3′-sulfo Lewis X antibody SU59 failed to stain HEV endothelial cells before and after sialidase treatment. The six anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies reacted equally well to the genuine sialyl Lewis X glycolipid in ELISA (Fig. 2 a), and we thought the difference in the reactivity of anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies against HEV endothelial cells stemmed from the different cross-reactivity of the antibodies. To determine whether the determinants detected by these anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies were sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants, which Hemmerich et al.(13Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4830-4835Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 14Hemmerich S. Leffler H. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12035-12047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) proposed were carried by GlyCAM-1 in murine lymph nodes, we tested the reactivity of the six anti-sialyl Lewis X antibodies against synthetic sulfo sialyl Lewis X determinants. As shown in Fig. 2 b, the sialyl Lewis X sulfated at β-Gal (6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X) was reactive to an unexpectedly wide variety of antibodies, including CSLEX-1, SNH-3, 2F3, 2H5, and HECA-452. Only the antibody FH-6 lost its binding activity upon 6-sulfation at the β-Gal moiety of the sialyl Lewis X structure. On the other hand, sialyl Lewis X sulfated at the β-GlcNAc moiety (6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X) was detected by antibodies 2F3, 2H5, and HECA-452, but not by antibodies CSLEX-1, SNH-3, and FH-6 (Fig. 2 c). This reaction profile was exactly the same as that of human HEV endothelial cells against these six antibodies, as indicated in Fig. 1, and suggested that 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X would be a good candidate for the sialyl Lewis X-like determinant expressed on HEV endothelial cells. The reactivity of disulfated sialyl Lewis X (6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X) was essentially the same as that of GlcNAc-sulfated sialyl Lewis X (6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X). The antibodies 2F3, 2H5, and HECA-452 were reactive to 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X, whereas FH-6 and CSLEX-1 were not (Fig. 2 d). This led us to assume that 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X is another good candidate for the determinant carried by human HEV endothelial cells. The only difference between 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X and 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X was that the latter determinant was weakly reactive to SNH-3. Next, we tested the reactivity of four anti-Lewis X antibodies, all of which recognize the Lewis X determinant (Fig. 2 e), against the asialo derivatives of the above sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinants (Fig. 2, f–h). Three out of the four anti-Lewis X antibodies were found to react to 6′-sulfo Lewis X (Fig. 2 f), whereas all of them failed to react to 6-sulfo Lewis X (Fig. 2 g). Since sialidase-treated HEV endothelial cells were not stained with any of the anti-Lewis X antibodies in immunohistochemical examination, these findings again suggest that 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X is actually the sialyl Lewis X-like determinant expressed on HEV endothelial cells, but 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X is not. Only one anti-Lewis X antibody (FH-2) showed a weak cross-reactivity, and the others were not reactive to 6,6′-bissulfo Lewis X (Fig. 2 h). None of the 10 antibodies tested was reactive to the 3′-sulfo Lewis X determinant, which had been reported to be present in mucin side chains of human meconium (28Capon C. Leroy Y. Wieruszeski J.-M. Ricart G. Strecker G. Montreuil J. Fournet B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and later found to bind to recombinant L-selectin (27Brandley B.K. Kiso M. Abbas S. Nikrad P. Srivasatava O. Foxall C. Oda Y. Hasegawa A. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Since analysis of the reactivity pattern of known anti-sialyl Lewis X and anti-Lewis X antibodies strongly suggested 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X is most probably the sulfated sialyl Lewis X determinant carried by HEV endothelial cells, we generated two monoclonal antibodies (G152 and G72) by immunizing synthetic 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X. The specificity of these new antibodies against pure carbohydrate determinants in ELISA is shown in Fig. 3. Both antibodies were strongly reactive to 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, but were not reactive to other related structures, including genuine sialyl Lewis X and 6′-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, and were only slightly cross-reactive to 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X in ELISA (Fig. 3). They did not react to asialo derivatives such as 6-sulfo Lewis X, 6′-sulfo Lewis X, 6,6′-bissulfo Lewis X, and 3′-sulfo Lewis X. G152 was not at all reactive, whereas G72 showed significant reactivity against the SL2L4 determinant, which does not contain a fucose residue (Fig. 3). The results of TLC immunostaining (Fig. 4) also confirmed the reactivity of the two antibodies, indicating that G152 detects only 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X, whereas G72 detects 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X and SL2L4. Cross-reactivity to 6,6′-bissulfo sialyl Lewis X was not detected by TLC immunostaining (data not shown), suggesting that this was only a weak and negligible cross-reactivity. These results indicate that the G152 antibody is highly specific to 6-sulfo sialyl Lewis X; it requires the presence of sialic acid and fucose residues and 6-sulfo modification at GlcNAc in the antigenic determinant for binding. The specificity of the G72 antibody was very similar to the specificity of G152, except that recognition of the fucose residue by this antibody seemed weaker than that by G152. Both G152 and G72 antibodies strongly stained HEV endothelial cells in human peripheral lymph nodes in immunohistochemical examination (Fig. 5). Frozen sections had to be used in the immunohist"

One of these, RHAMM variant 4 (RHAMMv4), is transforming when overexpressed and regulates Ras signaling (Hall et al.). Here we note using flow cytometry and confocal analysis that RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4 occur both on the cell surface and in the cytoplasm. Epitope-tagging experiments indicate that RHAMMv4 occurs only in the cytoplasm. Several observations suggest that both cell surface RHAMM isoforms and RHAMMv4 are involved in regulating extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. Affinity-purified anti-RHAMM exon 4 antibodies block the ability of platelet-derived growth factor to activate ERK, and these reagents modify the protein tyrosine phosphorylation profile of proteins resulting from treatment with platelet-derived growth factor. A dominant negative form of RHAMMv4 inhibits mutant active Ras activation of ERK and coimmunoprecipitates with both mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase and ERK, suggesting that the intracellular RHAMMv4 acts downstream of Ras, possibly at the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-ERK interactions. Consistent with this, overexpression of RHAMMv4 constitutively activates ERK. These results identify a novel mechanism for the regulation of the Ras-ERK signaling pathway and suggest that RHAMM plays multiple roles in this regulation.

Recently, a novel extracellular matrix binding protein, RHAMM, originally characterized for its ability to regulate cell motility (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), has been shown to control signaling through Ras. For instance, a dominant negative mutant of RHAMMv4 prevents mutant active Ras from transforming 10T1/2 fibroblasts (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C.

RHAMM has been reported to occur on the cell surface, intracellularly, and in the extracellular milieu (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M.

We report here that cell surface and intracellular RHAMM isoforms are required for the activation of ERK by PDGF and by mutant active Ras, respectively. Furthermore, overexpression of the intracellular RHAMMv4 constitutively activates ERK. These results identify novel regulatory mechanisms for the control of the ERK cascade. The murine fibroblast cell line 10T1/2, HA-Ras-10T1/2 CIRAS-3, RHAMMv4-transfected cells, and 10T1/2 cells expressing RHAMM antisense (U21 cells), were grown to subconfluency as described (1Hall C.L.

RHAMM contains two identified hyaluronan binding domains (amino acids 401–411 and 423–432) (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation was detected on Western blots using PY99 anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Santa Cruz). Bound secondary antibody was detected by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Some blots were incubated with biotinylated hyaluronan for detection of hyaluronan binding capacity of proteins as described (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V.

All mRNA was detected by performing RNA blotting experiments as described by Sambrook et al.(37Sambrook J. Fristch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). RNA was prepared from cells harvested at 50–70% confluence. Poly(A)+ mRNA was purified using an mRNA purification kit (Amersham). 10 μg of mRNA were separated by electrophoresis (50% formaldehyde, 1.2% agarose), transferred onto nylon nitrocellulose (Amersham), and fixed by UV-cross-linking using a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were prehybridized for 4 h at 42 °C in a solution consisting of 50% formamide, 6× saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.5% SDS, and denatured salmon sperm DNA. RNA was detected by hybridization with 32P-labeled nucleotides specific for exon 4 of RHAMMv4. After hybridization, the membranes were washed with 1X saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS; 0.1× saline/sodium/phosphate/EDTA, 0.1% SDS at 42–60 °C, and bound nucleotides were visualized by autoradiography. Equal loading of RNA was assessed by stripping the filters, then reprobing them with a32P-labeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. HA-Ras-transformed 10T1/2 (C3) cells, RHAMM-transfected cells, RHAMMv4-HA-tagged transfected cells, and their parent 10%1/2 fibroblasts were subcultured onto glass coverslips in complete media for 10 h then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde. After three washings in phosphate-buffered saline, monolayers were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with anti-HA antibody (5 μg/ml) (Babco, Berkeley, CA) and Phospho-MAP kinase antibody (1:100 dilution) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or IgG control in the washing buffer. After four washings, the coverslips were then either incubated with Texas red-conjugated goat anti-mouse (Jackson Immuno-Res Lab., West Grove, PA) or with biotinylated (for ERK staining) secondary antibody for 1 h. Observations and photomicrographs were conducted using a Zeiss confocal microscope. Cells were grown from 50 and 70% confluency, washed with cold Hanks' buffered saline solution, and detached with 2.5 mm EDTA in Hanks' buffered saline solution. Immunofluorescence staining was performed by cells (2 × 106) incubated with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:100) (Babco), anti-RHAMM antibody (Exon 4, 1:100 dilution), or with IgG control on ice for 30 min. The cells were then washed, incubated with the appropriate fluorescein isothiocyanateconjugated secondary antibody as described (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V.

Fluorescence was detected with an EPICS model 753 flow cytometer (Epics Inc., NY). Cell cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's minimal medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated bovine serum for 2–3 days before conducting assays. ERK was immunoprecipitated and washed once with radioimmune precipitation buffer, twice with 0.5 m LiCl/0.1m Tris, pH 8.0, and once with kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mmNa3VO4,0.3 mg/ml myelin basic protein) before the kinase reaction. The immunoprecipitated ERK was incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 20 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 15 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 15 μl of each sample was spotted onto P8I squares, washed three times with 75 mm phosphoric acid, and washed once with 100% acetone. Dried samples were quantified by scintillation counting (11Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong R. Fukasawa K. Van de Woude G.F. Ahn N.G.

Ahn, Howard Hughes Institute, Boulder, CO) alone or together with dominant mutant RHAMMv4 (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C.

Cultures were maintained for 3 weeks, at which time foci were counted after staining with hematoxylin. As shown in Fig. 1 A, anti-exon 4 antibodies, which specifically recognize RHAMM glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins encoding exon 4 (data not shown), revealed the presence of this epitope on the cell surface. IgG served as a control. Cell surface display of RHAMM was affected by culture confluence so that, at even at 70% confluency, cell surface RHAMM expression was lower. These results indicate that RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4 can be expressed at the cell surface depending upon culture conditions and are consistent with multiple reports of a cell surface location for RHAMM in subconfluent cultures (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 39Samuel S.K. Hurta R.A.R.

HA or myc epitope-tagged RHAMMv4 was not detected by flow cytometry analysis using anti-epitope tag antibodies (data not shown), but confocal analysis revealed the presence of this tagged RHAMM isoform intracellularly, particularly in cell processes (shown in Fig. 1 C for HA epitope). These results suggest that RHAMMv4 is not located at the cell surface in detectable levels, but rather is concentrated intracellularly in cell processes, a distribution we previously noted for RHAMM expressed in Ras-transformed cells (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with other reports showing a cytoplasmic location of RHAMM in transformed cells (31Teder P. Bergh J. Heldin P. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3908-3914PubMed Google Scholar) and with an absence of a signal peptide in the RHAMMv4 cDNA (33Entwistle J. Zhang S. Yang B. Wong C. Li Q. Hall C.L., A, J. Mowat M. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Gene. 1995; 163: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 10T1/2 cell lines that express varying levels of RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4 (Fig. 2 A) exhibited variations in the activation state of ERK, a kinase that acts downstream of Ras. Thus, cell lines expressing the highest levels of RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4 exhibited the highest levels of ERK activity (i.e. Ras-transformed and RHAMMv4-transfected cells) (Fig. 2 B). These results were consistent with our previous report suggesting that RHAMM regulates Ras signaling (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Interestingly, cell lines shown in Fig. 2 also differed in their ability to further activate ERK in response to PDGF (Fig. 2 C). Thus, cells that make little cell surface RHAMM (U21 cells) due to expression of RHAMM antisense, showed a poor ability to respond to PDGF (Fig. 2 C), even though the PDGF receptor was expressed in these cells (data not shown). In contrast, RHAMMv4- or Ras-transformed cells that expressed high levels of RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4 (Fig. 2 A) responded to PDGF with a 18–20-fold increase in ERK activity (Fig. 2 C). The 10T1/2 parent cell line, which expressed less cell surface RHAMM encoding exon 4 than either Ras- or RHAMMv4-transfected cells but more than U21 cells (Fig. 2 A), exhibited an intermediate response (8-fold stimulation) to PDGF (Fig. 2 C). To more directly assess the role of cell surface RHAMM in PDGF-mediated ERK activation, we added anti-RHAMM antibodies to the culture media before the addition of PDGF. Anti-RHAMM antibodies inhibited ERK stimulation by 50% (Fig. 2 C), except in U21 cells, which expressed little RHAMM (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and where the level of ERK activity was not blocked by anti-RHAMM antibodies. Stimulation of ERK activity by PDGF was also blocked by the addition of anti-RHAMM antibodies in NIH3T3 fibroblasts, indicating that this effect of RHAMM was not specific to one cell background (data not shown). To begin to address the mechanisms by which cell surface RHAMM may regulate PDGF-mediated activation of ERK, we assessed whether or not RHAMM was required for protein tyrosine phosphorylation by the PDGF receptor, which is an immediate response resulting from PDGF-PDGF receptor interactions and which is required for ERK activation. As shown in Fig. 2 D, cells that made little RHAMM due to expression of RHAMM antisense (U21 cells) showed a strongly reduced ability to phosphorylate p200, p54, p42/44 (ERKs, data not shown), and p36 proteins, which were strongly phosphorylated in cells that overexpress RHAMM (compare U21 cells to RHAMMv4-transfected cells, Fig. 2 D). Anti-RHAMM antibodies had no effect on the profile of proteins phosphorylated in U21 cells in response to PDGF, consistent with the low levels of RHAMM expressed by these cells. In contrast, RHAMM antibodies strongly inhibited the protein tyrosine phosphorylation of p200, p54, p44/42, and p36 in RHAMMv4-transfected cells. These RHAMM antibody-treated cells therefore resembled U21 cells in their ability to respond to PDGF by phosphorylating proteins on tyrosine. The identity of the proteins has not yet been established, but the p42/44 proteins were ERK1/2 by immunological criteria (data not shown). These results suggest that cell surface RHAMM plays an important role in regulating ERK activity by regulating the ability of the PDGF receptor to acutely effect phosphorylation of proteins. We next assessed whether RHAMMv4, which is cytoplasmic, was required for activation of ERK by a cytoplasmic activator of this kinase cascade, mutant active Ras. U21 (RHAMM antisense-transfected) cells that expressed little RHAMMv4 (Fig. 2 A) were transiently transfected with mutant active Ras, and the effect on ERK activation was assayed (Fig. 3 A). Although both the parental cells and U21 cells were equally efficiently transfected with Ras (see Hall et al. (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and data not shown), Ras activated ERK to a lesser extent in U21 than in parental 10T1/2 cells. Ras-transformed cells were next stably transfected with a dominant negative mutation of RHAMMv4, and the effect on ERK activity toward myelin basic protein of two independently selected clones was assessed (Fig. 3 B). The dominant negative mutation of RHAMM strongly suppressed ERK activity (Fig. 3 B), indicating that intracellular RHAMMv4 and Ras cooperated to activate ERK. To begin to assess the mechanism(s) by which RHAMMv4 regulates activation of ERK through Ras, we conducted transient transfections of 10T1/2 cells with mutant active Raf, mutant active MEK, and a dominant negative mutant of RHAMMv4 (1Hall C.L. Yang B. Yang X. Zhang S. Turley M. Samuel S. Lange L.A. Wang C. Curpen G.D. Savani R.C. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and assessed focus formation, which requires ERK activation by these regulators (3Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar) to rapidly screen for the step on the Ras ERK pathway that RHAMMv4 might be regulating. RHAMMv4 was required for both Raf-CAAX and mutant active MEK-mediated transformation of 10T1/2 cells (control foci number/dish, 21: Raf-CAAX and mutant RHAMMv4, 3.2, active MEK and mutant RHAMMv4, 4.1). Next, the ability of RHAMM antibodies to coimmunoprecipitate components of MAP kinase cascades was assessed (Fig. 4). As noted in Fig. 4, A and B, anti-RHAMM antibodies coimmunoprecipitated both ERK1 and MEK in RHAMMv4-transfected cells. Further, ERK antibodies coimmunoprecipitated an HA epitope-tagged RHAMMv4 transfected into parental 10T1/2 cells, which normally express little of this isoform (Fig. 2 A), confirming that ERK interacts with the cytoplasmic RHAMMv4. Dominant mutant HA-tagged RHAMMv4 did not coimmunoprecipitate with ERK or MEK (data not shown). These data relate the ability of RHAMMv4 to regulate ERK activity to its ability to coassociate with this kinase. We were unable to observe coimmunoprecipitation of RHAMM with either ERK2, Ras, or Raf (data not shown). Furthermore, an association of RHAMMv4 with other MAP kinases including c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 kinases was not detected (Fig. 4 D). Overall, these results are consistent with an effect of RHAMMv4 at the level of MEK-ERK interactions.Figure 4A, coimmunoprecipitation of ERK1 with anti-RHAMM antibodies from RHAMMv4-transfected cells. RHAMM antibodies coimmunoprecipitate approximately 20% of total cellular ERK, detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK antibodies. Nonimmune IgG and RHAMM antibody preincubated with the RHAMM peptide to which it was raised serve as controls. B, anti-RHAMM antibodies coimmunoprecipitate MEK. Nonimmune IgG and RHAMM antibody preincubated with the peptide to which it was raised serve as controls.C, anti-ERK antibodies coimmunoprecipitate HA epitope-tagged RHAMMv4 transfected into 10T1/2 cells. These results confirm that ERK associates with the cytoplasmic RHAMMv4. Nonimmune IgG and anti-ERK antibodies preincubated with the peptide to which they were raised serve as controls. D, anti-RHAMM antibodies did not coimmunoprecipitate either c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase or p38 MAP kinases, even though these kinases are clearly present in RHAMMv4-transfected cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Consistent with its increased activity toward myelin basic protein (Fig. 2 B), phosphorylated forms of ERK were also uniquely observed in Ras- or RHAMMv4-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A). Furthermore, activated ERK was uniquely observed in the nucleus of mutant active Ras- and RHAMMv4-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B). Our results indicate that RHAMM isoforms encoding exon 4, which occur at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm, are both required for activation of the ERK by growth factors such as the PDGF as well as by cytoplasmic regulators such as mutant active Ras. A role for cell surface RHAMM in controlling signaling is consistent with a number of previous studies that have shown a variety of RHAMM antibodies (39Samuel S.K. Hurta R.A.R.

Soc. 1995; 38: 131-136PubMed Google Scholar) to block cell motility. The ability of cell surface RHAMM to regulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation effected by PDGF is consistent with our previous demonstration that RHAMM controls protein tyrosine phosporylation cascades during cell motility (44Hall C.L. Wang C. Lange L.A. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms by which RHAMM modifies protein tyrosine phosphorylation effected by the PDGF receptor is not yet clear but an effect on Src, which is recruited to the PDGF receptor after autophosphorylation (45Claesson-Welsh M. Int. J. Biochem. 1996; 28: 373-385Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and which is regulated by RHAMM (34Hall C.L. Lange L.A. Prober D.A. Zhang S. Turley E.A. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 2213-2224PubMed Google Scholar) is possible. Known RHAMM isoforms do not encode a transmembrane domain (33Entwistle J. Zhang S. Yang B. Wong C. Li Q. Hall C.L., A, J. Mowat M. Greenberg A.H. Turley E.A. Gene. 1995; 163: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 48Sherman L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), and this protein may therefore associate with the cell surface by linkage to a glycophosphatidylinositol tail (49Varelo-Nieto I. Leon Y. Caro H.N. Comp. Biochem. Phsyiol. 1996; 115: 223-241Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar) or as a peripheral protein (50Jutila M.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Both of such classes of cell surface proteins have been shown to regulate signaling (49Varelo-Nieto I. Leon Y. Caro H.N. Comp. Biochem. Phsyiol. 1996; 115: 223-241Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 50Jutila M.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1994; 55: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In many cases, such cell surface molecules appear to act as co-receptors, modifying the signaling ability of a transmembrane protein. For instance, glycophosphatidylinositol-linked proteins contribute to the signaling capability of the T cell receptor complex (51Resta R. Thompson L.F. Cell. Signalling. 1997; 9: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), transforming growth factor β receptor complexes (52Massague J. Chiefetz S. Laiho M. Ralph D.A. Weis F.N.B. Zentella A. Cancer Surv. 1992; 12: 81-103PubMed Google Scholar), and integrins (53Wei Y. Lukashev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), many of which regulate MAP kinase activity. The ability of RHAMM to modify the signaling of a receptor tyrosine kinase is reminiscent of the recent demonstration that another cell surface hyaluronan binding protein, CD44, regulates protein tryosine phosphorylation by the Her2/Neu receptor (46Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Chu A. Iida N. Zhang L. Hung M-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Indeed the effects of CD44 (46Bourguignon L.Y.W. Zhu H. Chu A. Iida N. Zhang L. Hung M-C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27913-27918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and of RHAMM noted here are consistent with increasing evidence pointing to the presence of accessory cell surface proteins that modify protein tyrosine phosphorylation cascades initiated by receptor and non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases and that are required for cell functions such as motility (i.e. Ref. 47Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic location of RHAMMv4 and the ability of a RHAMMv4 dominant mutant to block mutant active Ras activation of ERK also predicts a role for this isoform in regulating ERK. The data presented here are consistent with an action of RHAMMv4 at the level of modifying MEK-ERK interactions, but whether these interactions occur directly or via other proteins remains to be demonstrated. It is interesting that even though Ras has been shown to co-distribute with RHAMM in cell processes (29Hardwick C. Hoare K. Owens R. Hohn H.P. Hook M. Moore D. Cripps V. Austen L. Nance D.M. Turley E.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1343-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), it does not coimmunoprecipitate with RHAMM, at least using the conditions described here. ERK has also been reported to occur under certain conditions in the cell processes (3Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3192) Google Scholar, 4Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14843-14846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar), and the presence of both RHAMMv4 and ERK here is intriguing given the role of both these proteins in cell motility (8Klemke R.L.

RHAMMv4 does not encode obvious protein motifs that have traditionally been linked to signal transduction, and since it does not appear to associate with either Ras or Raf, it is not acting as a scaffold protein in the sense of the yeast STE5, which links all of the components of the MAP kinase cascade (54Erride B. Casu R.M. Yashar D.M. Kamada Y. Levin D.E. Irie K. Matsumoto K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) homologous to the mammalian ERK cascade. It is interesting that a mammalian homologue of Ksr (55Yu W. Fantl W.J. Harrowe G. Williams L.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 56-64Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) binds to both MEK and ERK, resulting in inhibition of ERK activity. It may be therefore that the mammalian Ras ERK cascade is modular and that proteins like Ksr link MEK and ERK in an inactive complex, whereas RHAMMv4 links at least a percentage of the two kinases in an active complex. It is clear, however, that RHAMMv4 does not complex all cellular ERK but a rather a fraction of it, and this largely appears to be ERK1 rather than ERK2. The functional significance of this compartmentalization is not yet clear but may be related to a regulation of cell motility. The apparent ability of RHAMM isoforms to occur at both the cell surface and in the cytoplasm and to perform a function at both of these locations is similar to the family of ectoenzymes (56Konkoy C.S. Davis T.P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which include glycosyltransferases (57Stanley P. Ioffe E. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 58Kannagi R. Nippon Geka Gakkai Zasshi. 1996; 97: 131-139PubMed Google Scholar), and TM4 proteins, which regulate cell motility (47Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S FASEB J. 1997; 11: 428-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar). Cell surface glycosyltransferases have been shown to be involved in cell adhesion and in transmitting signals while they perform synthetic functions intracellularly (59Dubois D.H. Shur B.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1995; 376: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In summary, we show that the hyaluronan binding protein RHAMM may function at the cell surface level as a co-stimulatory requirement for PDGF activation of ERK. Our studies also suggest a role for intracellular RHAMM in mutant Ras regulation of ERK, possibly as a result of an interaction of RHAMMv4 with MEK/ERK complexes. These results identify a novel regulation of a MAP kinase cascade that is key to controlling cell proliferation and motility. We gratefully thank Dr. S.

Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 171-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), both PKG and the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) can also relax permeabilized smooth muscle at constant [Ca2+] i (11Pfitzer G. Merkel L. Ruegg J.C. Hofmann F. Eur. J. Physiol. 1986; 407: 87-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We have reported that 8-Br-cGMP reverses G-protein-coupled Ca2+ sensitization and accelerates relaxation and dephosphorylation of MLC20 at constant [Ca2+] i (12Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The mechanism of the Ca2+-desensitizing effect of cAMP and cGMP is not known, and, in search of it, we identified telokin as the major cytosolic protein phosphorylated under the influence of 8-Br-cGMP. Telokin was first discovered by Hartshorne and colleagues (13Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and found to be identical with the COOH terminus (155–156 amino acids) of smooth muscle MLCK (13Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is independently expressed in certain smooth muscles (14Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23945-23952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) through the activities of serum response factor (15Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1394-C1404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a smooth muscle-specific promoter located in an intron of the MLCK gene (16Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of telokin solved at 2.6-Å resolution showed a characteristic immunoglobulin fold, but the NH2 terminus containing the phosphorylation sites could not be visualized (17Holden H.M. Ito M. Hartshorne D.J. Raymond I. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 840-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Telokin, also known as kinase-related protein (18Collinge M. Matrisian P.E. Zimmer W.E. Shattuck R.L. Lukas T.J. van Eldik L.J. Watterson D.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2359-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), binds to the S1/S2 region of unphosphorylated smooth muscle myosin (19Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K.

J. 1997; 322: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and, also in vitro, inhibits the phosphorylation of myosin by MLCK (19Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 25353-25358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Telokin also prevents the folding of the 6 S myosin into 10 S conformation (22Masato T. Numata T. Katoh T. Morita F. Yazawa M. J. Biochem. 1997; 121: 225-230PubMed Google Scholar) and stabilizes filamentous myosin in solution (19Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, it has been suggested that stabilization of myosin filaments is a physiological function of telokin in smooth muscle (19Shirinsky V.P. Vorotnikov A.V. Birukov K.G. Nanaev A.K. Collinge M. Lukas T.J. Sellers J.R. Watterson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16578-16583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the major in situ effect of telokin is desensitization to [Ca2+] i through a mechanism that does not significantly affect thiophosphorylation but accelerates the dephosphorylation of MLC20 and acts synergistically with the Ca2+-desensitizing effect of an 8-Br-cGMP-activated kinase. Preliminary results of some of these findings have been published (23Wu X. Haystead T.A.J. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biophys. J. 1997; 72 (abstr.): 178Google Scholar). Longitudinal muscle of the ileum was removed from rabbits anesthetized by halothane and exsanguinated according to approved animal protocols. Two groups of intact rabbit ileum longitudinal smooth muscle strips were incubated in Hepes-buffered Krebs solution in the presence of [32P]PO43− (5 mCi/ml, NEN Life Science Products) at room temperature for 1 h, followed by the addition of forskolin (20 μm) to one group. At 10 min, both control and forskolin-treated groups were rapidly frozen in liquid N2 and then homogenized with a glass-glass homogenizer in lysis buffer A containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 250 mm sucrose, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem), and 0.1 μm okadaic acid. Aliquots of cell lysates were then mixed with Laemmli sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) for SDS-PAGE (15% acrylamide unless otherwise stated) analysis and/or subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (first dimension pH ranges used were pH 3–10, pH 4–6.5, pH 5–7, and pH 8–10; Pharmalyte, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (25Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denny G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by autoradiography and Western blot analysis. In another series of experiments, rabbit ileum muscle strips were permeabilized with Staphylococcal aureus α-toxin based on published protocols (12Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Kobayashi S. Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 17997-18004Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) containing 10 mm EGTA and 0.5 mm [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products), with or without 100 μm8-Br-cGMP. Similar procedures as above were carried out to screen for phosphoproteins showing increased 32P incorporation upon treatment with 100 μm 8-Br-cGMP. In order to identify the proteins with increased 32P incorporation upon forskolin or 8-Br-cGMP treatment, we collected the supernatant of ∼1 g of rabbit ileum longitudinal smooth muscle (with or without treatment with 20 μm forskolin) homogenized in buffer A and centrifuged at 100,000 × g and partially purified this soluble fraction by anion exchange chromatography (AP-1Q, Waters) using a 200-ml linear gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4) over 100 min. Fractions were collected at 2 ml/min and 1 min/fraction. Aliquots (50 μl) of each fraction were examined with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using ampholyte pH 4–6.5, and the fractions containing small (22–24 kDa), acidic (pI 4.2–4.4) proteins detected by silver staining were pooled and concentrated 5-fold using a centrifuge filter (CentriPrep 3, Amicon). A 15-μl aliquot was then analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis together with an in vivo labeled tissue lysate to determine whether these small acidic proteins co-migrated with forskolin- and 8-Br-cGMP-stimulated phosphoproteins. The small acidic proteins in the two-dimensional gels were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, and peptides eluted from the gel matrix were sequenced by LC mass spectrometry (Biomolecular Research Facilities, University of Virginia). Native telokin was purified from frozen turkey gizzards by chromatography on DEAE-anion exchange followed by phenyl-Superose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the published method (13Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant rabbit telokin was expressed from a pET vector expression plasmid (a generous gift of Dr. Paul Herring, Indiana University) in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Novagen). Expression of telokin was induced by 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside at a cell density of A 650 = 0.3. After 2 h, cells were harvested and broken open by a French press pressure cell at 18,500 p.s.i. The soluble fraction was purified by isoelectric precipitation on ice at pH 5.0 followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g, and the supernatant was adjusted to pH 7.4 before DEAE-anion exchange chromatography, which resulted in recombinant telokin that was over 90% pure. Both native and recombinant telokin were identified and characterized by characteristic blue staining of acidic proteins with Stains-all (13Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified turkey gizzard telokin (a generous gift of Drs. David Hartshorne and Masaaki Ito), and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (pH 4–6.5). Concentrations of purified telokin were determined with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). We note that the Bradford (Bio-Rad) assay uses Coomassie Blue, which binds much less to acidic proteins than to standard bovine serum albumin. Phosphorylation of native and recombinant telokin was determined in kinase assay systems using the following reagents: catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (5–10 units/reaction, New England Biolabs; 1 unit is the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 nmol of phosphate to Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (Kemptide) in 1 min at 30 °C), cGMP-dependent protein kinase (5000–10,000 units/reaction, Calbiochem; 1 unit is the amount of enzyme required to transfer 1 pmol of phosphate to a peptide substrate, GTRGRRNSI, in 1 min at 30 °C), p42/44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase (27Scott A. Haystead C.M.M. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24540-24547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), or calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (New England Biolabs). Assays with the commercially available kinases were carried out exactly according to protocols provided by the manufacturers, with telokin (0.2 mg/ml) as the substrate at room temperature. Reaction with activated p42/44 MAP kinase (27Scott A. Haystead C.M.M. Haystead T.A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24540-24547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was carried out in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 1 mm β-mecaptoethanol, 0.039 mg/ml activated kinase, 0.2 mg/ml telokin, 10 mmMgCl2, 0.25 mm [32P]ATP (10 mCi/mmol) at room temperature. Reactions were stopped at desired time points by mixing an aliquot (10 μl) of the reaction with 4× Laemmli buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) (10 μl) and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Rabbit ileum longitudinal smooth muscle strips (3–4 mm long, 400–600 μm wide) were permeabilized with S. aureus α-toxin using published protocols (12Wu X. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 658-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 26Kobayashi S. Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

For storage, muscle strips were permeabilized for 20 min with 0.1% Triton X-100 in G1, immersed in a relaxing solution with 50% glycerol, and stored at −20 °C. Stored strips were washed three times with G1 solution just prior to use at room temperature. Strips could be stored up to 4 weeks. Details of solutions have been published previously (25Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denny G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kobayashi S. Kitazawa T. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol.

Treated or control smooth muscle tissues were frozen with liquid N2 and homogenized with buffer A. Approximately 20 μg of total protein, determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), from each tissue homogenate was subjected to 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to PVDF (Millipore Corp.) membranes. Post-transfer gels were stained with Coomassie Blue. PVDF membranes were incubated with 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) for 30 min and then blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST for 1 h. After PBST washes (10 min), the PVDF membranes were incubated with anti-telokin antibody at a 1:5000 dilution in PBST (∼1 μg/ml) for 3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. Following PBST washes (20 min), incubation with a secondary anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 1:8000 dilution in PBST for 1 h at room temperature, and final PBST washes (15 min), the immunoreactive proteins were visualized on film with enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ECL detections were carried out according to the manufacturer's directions, and the normal exposure time of the x-ray film (DuPont) to PVDF blots was 30 s. Ready gels (4–20%; Bio-Rad) were used for immunoblotting with anti-PKG and anti-PKA antibodies. Two anti-PKG antibodies were used: a goat polyclonal anti-bovine PKG as a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Lincoln (University of Alabama at Birmingham) and a rabbit polyclonal anti-human PKG type Iα and Iβ purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. A rabbit polyclonal anti-PKA (NH2-terminal residues 7–21 of the human α-isoform of the catalytic subunit of PKA) was also purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Immunoblotting procedures were according to the protocol provided by Dr. Padmini Komalavilas, which uses nitrocellulose instead of PVDF, for the goat anti-bovine PKG and the manufacturer's directions for the rabbit polyclonal anti-PKG and anti-PKA antibodies. Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-goat IgG (Jackson Laboratories) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The smooth muscle strips used for recording tension were frozen at selected time points by quickly transferring the specimen to Freon 22 precooled with liquid N2 and cutting the frozen strips away from the hooks on the tension recording apparatus. To identify phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated MLC20, tissue homogenates were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with ampholyte pH 4.5–5.4, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, and stained with AuroDye (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (25Kitazawa T. Gaylinn B.D. Denny G.H. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1708-1715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein spots were analyzed by densitometry (Molecular Analyst, Bio-Rad). The percentage of MLC20 phosphorylation or thiophosphorylation was expressed as (P1 + P2)/(U + P1 +P2) (where U represents unphosphorylated,P1 represents singly phosphorylated, and P2represents doubly phosphorylated). To measure telokin-induced dephosphorylation of MLC20, muscle strips were contracted with pCa 6.2 or pCa 6.0 solutions, with or without telokin treatment at 10 min, and frozen at 15 min after exposure to Ca2+. For thiophosphorylation studies, stored rabbit ileum smooth muscle strips were incubated in Ca2+-free, ATP-free solution at room temperature for 9 min, followed by ATP-free pCa 6.2 solution with 0.5 μm calmodulin in the presence or absence of telokin (20 μm). Thiophosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATPγS (Boehringer Mannheim), followed by incubation for 1 or 5 min as indicated. Strips were then washed with Ca2+-free, ATP-free solution, and subsequently force was measured upon exposure to G1 solution containing 4.5 mmATP. Student's t test was performed as indicated under “Results” (Microsoft Excel). All values are means ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated, and n is the number of observations. All reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Both 8-Br-cGMP (100 μm) and forskolin (20 μm) induced protein phosphorylation in, respectively, α-toxin-permeabilized and intact rabbit ileum smooth muscle (Fig. 1) and markedly increased 32P incorporation into a group of small (22–24 kDa upon SDS-PAGE), soluble, acidic (pI 4.2–4.4) protein(s) (Fig. 2, A and B). There was also a significant, but lesser, amount 32P incorporation into these same proteins in control intact muscle, indicating a basal level of phosphorylation. Analysis of the partially purified rabbit ileum smooth muscle (with or without 20 μm forskolin treatment) cytosolic proteins “spiked” with the 32P-labeled tissue lysates (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed that the two more acidic spots on two-dimensional gels detected by silver staining (vertically smeared) exactly matched32P-containing spots shown by autoradiography (data not shown). An aliquot (60 μl) of the concentrated partially purified intact rabbit ileum smooth muscle cytosol, enriched with the small, acidic proteins, was then subjected to another two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and the second dimensional gel was stained with Coomassie Blue. At least six faintly stained, distinct, small spots were detected, four of which were subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Six eluted peptides sequenced by LC mass spectrometry unambiguously matched the sequence of telokin (TableI). Western blotting of the two-dimensional gel of the 32P-labeled muscle lysate, using a rabbit polyclonal anti-telokin antibody, further confirmed that each of the group of small, acidic, phosphoproteins consisted of telokin (Fig. 2 C).Figure 2Autoradiograph and Western blot of whole tissue lysates of rabbit ileum smooth muscle after two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

Telokin was isolated from frozen turkey gizzards by the method published (13Ito M. Dabrowska R. Guerriero Jr., V. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13971-13974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and purified telokin migrated as a group of at least three protein bands of 24–26 kDa on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 3 A); each band was an acidic protein as shown on the two-dimensional gel (pI ∼4.4), stained blue with Stains-all, and was recognized by the anti-telokin antibody (data not shown); the heterogeneity of avian telokin was recently characterized (30Rusconi F. Potier M.C. Le Caer J.P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11021-11026Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and probably accounts for the appearance of multiple bands upon SDS-PAGE. We also expressed a rabbit clone of telokin using a pET vector in BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli cells and purified the protein based on the method used for isolation of turkey gizzard telokin with some modifications (see “Experimental Procedures”). A yield of 10 mg of telokin/liter of culture was achieved, and the purified recombinant telokin was also consistently detected as multiple bands (22–24 kDa) on one-dimensional 15% SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 3 A) and as multiple spots (pI ∼4.4) on two-dimensional gels by silver staining and/or Western blotting. The difference between the apparent molecular weights of native (avian) and recombinant (rabbit) telokins has been reported (14Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23945-23952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and arises from small differences in amino acid sequences including three different translational initiation sites as well as COOH-terminal glutamate residues in the avian protein (30Rusconi F. Potier M.C. Le Caer J.P. Schmitter J.M. Rossier J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11021-11026Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Following storage at 4 °C, native gizzard telokin migrated as one band upon SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3 B) without an apparent decrease in molecular mass (∼26 kDa), whereas recombinant telokin migrated as one major band around 17 kDa (Fig. 3 B). Sequencing the 17-kDa recombinant telokin by Edman degradation (Protein Sequencer; Applied Biosystems, Inc.) showed that the NH2-terminal 10 residues were FLEAVAEEKP, indicating that the 34 NH2-terminal amino acids were missing. The 17-kDa recombinant telokin (amino acids 35–155) was also an acidic protein (pI 4.2–4.4) and stained blue by Stains-all (data not shown), suggesting that it retained the COOH-terminal glutamate residues. Both turkey gizzard and recombinant telokin were good substrates for the catalytic subunit of PKA in vitro, but the time course of recombinant telokin phosphorylation was much faster (reaching a stoichiometry of ∼0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in 8 min) than that of native telokin (reaching a stoichiometry of ∼0.7 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in 32 min) (Fig. 4). This difference in phosphorylation may be due to a basal level of phosphorylation in native gizzard telokin. The holoenzyme of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (activated by 0.5 μm 8-Br-cGMP) phosphorylated turkey gizzard and recombinant telokin slowly to a stoichiometry of 0.4 mol of phosphate/mol of protein in 64 min (Fig. 4). Mass spectrometry of rabbit ileum smooth muscle telokin peptides eluted from two-dimensional gels showed a possibly phosphorylated serin"

Co-transfection experiments in which α- and β-dystroglycan form a complex with AChR and rapsyn, a peripheral protein required for AChR clustering (Apel, D. A., Roberds, S. L., Campbell, K.

We have investigated the interaction between rapsyn and β-dystroglycan in TorpedoAChR-rich membranes using in situ and in vitroapproaches. Cross-linking experiments were carried out to study the topography of postsynaptic membrane polypeptides. A cross-linked product of 90 kDa was labeled by antibodies to rapsyn and β-dystroglycan; this demonstrates that these polypeptides are in close proximity to one another. Affinity chromatography experiments and ligand blot assays using rapsyn solubilized from TorpedoAChR-rich membranes and constructs containing β-dystroglycan C-terminal fragments show that a rapsyn-binding site is present in the juxtamembranous region of the cytoplasmic tail of β-dystroglycan. These data point out that rapsyn and dystroglycan interact in the postsynaptic membrane and thus reinforce the notion that dystroglycan could be involved in synaptogenesis.

Clustering of AChR is a complex process involving several partners being triggered by the nerve-derived trophic factor agrin (for a review, see Ref. 1McMahan U.J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1990; 55: 407-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A major step in the understanding of how agrin works was provided recently by the discovery of MuSK, a synaptic muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (2Valenzuela D.M. Stitt T.N. DiStefano P.S. Rojas E. Mattsson K. Compton D.L. Nunez L. Park J.S. Stark J.L. Gies D.R. Thomas S. LeBeau M.M. Fernald A.A. Copland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Burden S.J. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

Once activated by agrin, MuSK-receptor complex sparks a cascade of events that leads ultimately to the building of the NMJ (4DeChiara T.M. Bowen D.C. Valenzuela D.M. Simmons M.V. Poueymirou W.T. Thomas S. Kinetz E. Compton D.L. Rojas E. Parks J.S. Smith C. DiStefano P.S. Glass D.J. Burden S.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1996; 85: 501-512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). In addition, several extrinsic proteins associated with the postsynaptic membrane in muscle or electrocyte have been implicated in the formation and/or the maintenance of AChR clusters. Extraction of these proteins from AChR-rich membrane induces the mobility of the AChR in the plane of the membrane (5Barrantes F.J. Neugebauer D.C. Zingsheim H.P. FEBS Lett. 1980; 112: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 6Lo M.M.S. Garland P.B. Lamprecht J. Barnard E.A.

These proteins thus participate in the anchoring of AChRs in the membrane. Among them, the 43-kDa AChR-associated protein rapsyn (9Frail D.E. McLaughlin L.L. Mudd J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 15602-15607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) plays a direct role in the clustering of AChR and all other postsynaptic membrane components as deduced from co-transfection experiments (10Philipps W.D. Merlie J.P. BioEssays. 1992; 14: 671-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 11Philipps W.D. Noakes P.G. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and from rapsyn-deficient mice (12Gautam M. Noakes P.G. Mudd J. Nichol M. Chu G.C. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nature. 1995; 377: 232-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In addition to its structural role, rapsyn is required in an early step of MuSK signaling, i.e. AChR phosphorylation (13Apel D.E. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). From these studies, it could be proposed that rapsyn interacts directly or indirectly with several components of the postsynaptic membrane including MuSK and AChR to fulfill both structural and signaling functions in synaptic differentiation. Several other peripheral proteins, M r 58,000 syntrophin(s) (14Adams M.E. Butler M.H. Dwyer T.M. Peters M.F. Murmane A.A. Froehner S.C. Neuron. 1993; 11: 531-540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and M r 87,000 dystrobrevin (15Carr C. Fischbach G.D. Cohen J.B. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1753-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), have been identified in Torpedo electromotor synapse and co-localize with AChRs at the NMJ. These latter two proteins are part of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) present at the sarcolemma (16Ervasti J.M. Campbell K.P. Cell. 1991; 66: 1121-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar) and of the utrophin complex at the synapse (for a review, see Ref. 17Ahn A.H. Kunkel L.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Since dystrophin and dystrophin-associated proteins are found at large AChR clusters in cultured muscle cells as well as at synapses in vivo, they may also participate in synaptogenesis (11Philipps W.D. Noakes P.G. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1837-1846PubMed Google Scholar). Major components of the DGC are dystroglycans. Dystroglycans consist of a 156-kDa extracellular laminin-binding glycosylated protein (α-dystroglycan) and a 46–50-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein (β-dystroglycan) that result from proteolytic cleavage of a single transmembrane precursor (20Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Ervasti J.M. Leveille C.J. Slaughter C.A. Sernett S.W. Campbell K.P. Nature. 1992; 355: 696-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). Dystroglycans are believed to form a continuous link between the extracellular matrix and the submembranous skeleton at the sarcolemma (for a review, see Ref. 21Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). α-Dystroglycan has been identified as an agrin-binding site and, as such, was postulated to represent a major actor in synapse formation (for a review, see Ref. 22Carbonetto S. Lindenbaum M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 596-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, several observations have weakened the case for α-dystroglycan as the signal-transducing agrin receptor (23Sugiyama J. Bowen D.C. Hall Z.W. Neuron. 1994; 13: 103-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 24Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B.

Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, it is likely to play a structural role in AChR clustering, perhaps as part of a diffusion trap for AChRs (18Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 19Cartaud A. Ludosky M.A. Haaseman M. Jung D. Campbell K.P. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1837-1846PubMed Google Scholar). By using the quail fibroblast expression system, Apel et al. (26Apel D.A. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported that upon co-transfection with α- and β-dystroglycan along with rapsyn and AChR subunits cDNAs, dystroglycans co-localize with rapsyn-induced clusters both in the presence or in the absence of co-expressed AChRs. These experiments highlighted a possible role for rapsyn as a link between AChR and the dystroglycans (probably β-dystroglycan). In order to explore the function of dystroglycans in AChR clustering, we examine in situ and in vitro the molecular interactions between rapsyn and β-dystroglycan using chemical cross-linking and binding experiments. In cross-linking experiments, these two polypeptides are found in close proximity from one another in the native AChR-rich membrane. Affinity chromatography and ligand blotin vitro assays allowed us to identify a rapsyn-binding site in the juxtamembranous region (corresponding to amino acids 787–819) of the cytoplasmic tail of β-dystroglycan. These new data support the notion that rapsyn may function as a molecular link connecting AChRs and DGC at the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. The ability of β-dystroglycan and rapsyn to establish multiple interactions with partners from both inside and outside the cell places these molecules at a key position in the differentiation of the postsynaptic membrane during synaptogenesis. The following primary antibodies were used. Anti-rapsyn mouse monoclonal antibody mAb 1234 A was a generous gift from Dr. Froehner (27Peng H.B. Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1698-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal anti-β-dystroglycan antibody was generated against a synthetic peptide of the last 20 amino acids of β-dystroglycan C terminus (28Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Anti-GST rabbit polyclonal antibody and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and goat anti-mouse IgG were from Promega, Madison, WI. The protein concentrations were estimated using BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Succinimidyl 4-(p-maleimidophenyl) butyrate (SMPB) was purchased from Pierce. All other reagents were from the highest grade available. Acetylcholine receptor-rich membranes were purified according to Saitoh and Changeux (29Saitoh T. Changeux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) from freshly dissectedTorpedo electric tissue obtained from the Institut de Biologie Marine, Arcachon, France. Proteolysis was prevented by the addition of the protease inhibitors leupeptin (Sigma, 5 μg/ml), pepstatin A (Sigma, 5 μg/ml), EDTA (5 mm), EGTA (5 mm), 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Calbiochem, 0.2 mm), and N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma, 10 mm) in all buffers. Typically 10–20 mg of membrane proteins were obtained from 100–200 g of fresh tissue. Cross-linking experiments were performed according to the protocol described by Burden et al. (30Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) using an heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent that contains N-ethylmaleimide andN-hydroxysuccinimide as reactive groups. Briefly, AChR-rich membranes were washed with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% sodium azide, pH 7.4, pelleted by centrifugation, and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, at a final concentration of 4 mg of protein/ml. SMPB (0.12 nm between reactive groups) in Me2SO (2% v/v stock solution) was added to the membranes at concentrations of 10−7 to 10−4m and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Membranes were then pelleted and washed in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, before solubilization in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Forty μg of membrane proteins were loaded in each lane. Analysis of the cross-linked products were subsequently performed by Western blotting followed by ECL detection. For affinity chromatography, rapsyn was solubilized by alkali treatment for 10 min at 4 °C according to Neubig et al.(31Neubig R.R. Krodel E.K. Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The alkali extract (S11) was neutralized to pH 7.5 with 2m Tris-HCl, pH 7.0. Stripped membrane fragments and insoluble aggregates were then removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 × g. For two-dimensional SDS-PAGE separation, rapsyn was extracted by lithium diiodosalicylate (LiS) according to Carr et al. (32Carr C. McCourt D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7090-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) as follows. AChR-rich membranes were suspended at 15 mg of protein/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1. A 1/9 volume of 0.1 m LiS in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.1, was added; the suspension was incubated on ice for 60 min; and the membranes were then removed by centrifugation for 40 min at 100,000 × g. The final supernatant containing most of the solubilized rapsyn called LiS extract was further processed for two-dimensional analysis. Cloning of rabbit brain dystroglycan and construction of plasmids encoding β-dystroglycan cytoplasmic fragments was achieved as described by Rosa et al. (28Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The constructs β-C2 and β-C3 corresponding to residues 821–895 and 787–819 of the cytoplasmic tail of dystroglycan and a construct corresponding to residues 467–500 of α-dystroglycan (ectodomain) were expressed as glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in BL21 strain ofEscherichia coli. Recombinant proteins were purified following the procedure described by Kennedy et al.(33Kennedy S.P. Warren S.S. Forget B.G. Morrow J.S. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). GST and GST fusion proteins were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B according to the supplier's instructions. Control GST and GST fusion proteins were equilibrated in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated 2.5 h at 4 °C with freshly prepared alkali extract (S11) neutralized to pH 7.5. After incubation, the glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline by centrifugation. For immunoblot analysis, Laemmli's sample buffer (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was directly added to Sepharose beads before separation by SDS-PAGE and transfer onto nitrocellulose. 8 or 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II slab cell (Bio-Rad). Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was accomplished essentially as described by O'Farell (35O'Farell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) on LiS extract following the protocol described by Carr et al. (32Carr C. McCourt D. Cohen J.B. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 7090-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Sample buffer was composed of 9.95 m urea, 2% Nonidet P-40, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 2% Ampholines (1 part pH 3.5–10, 2.5 parts pH 5–8, and 2.5 parts pH7–9, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Bromma, Sweden). Isoelectrofocusing gels were made in 0.4% Ampholines pH 3.5–10, in 1% Ampholines pH 5–8, in 1% Ampholines pH 7–9 for 30 min at 150 V, 4 h at 200 V, and 10 min at 800 V in a Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II slab cell, as described by Bollag and Edelstein (36Bollag D.M. Edelstein S.J. Protein Methods. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1991: 161-180Google Scholar). This method allowed highly reproducible isoelectric focusing and easy comparison of several protein samples. The second dimension was carried out on strips of gels from the first dimension fitted over 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins separated by one- or two-dimensional gel electrophoresis were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) according to Towbin et al. (37Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar) and stained with Ponceau Red. Western blots were performed as described previously (38Cartaud A. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13019-13022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), revealed using enhanced chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Fuji X-Ray films (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). In some cases, blots were stripped for 1 h at 55 °C in 2% SDS, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol, 60 mm Tris, pH 6.7, and reprobed with antibodies as described (38Cartaud A. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13019-13022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Dystroglycan-GST fusion protein binding assay was achieved on blots as described by Carr and Scott (39Carr D.W. Scott J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 246-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). GST control, dystroglycan constructs β-C2, β-C3, and α-ectodomain (1 μm) were incubated for 2 h on the nitrocellulose strips on which proteins from purified AChR-rich membranes or LiS extract were electrotransferred after separation by one- or two-dimensional SDS-PAGE, respectively. Bound GST fusion proteins were revealed using anti-GST antibody followed by ECL detection. To study the topography of postsynaptic membrane polypeptides toward rapsyn, we have used the cross-linking protocol developed by Burden et al. (30Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) for the study of the association between AChR subunits and rapsyn. These authors have taken advantage of the fact that rapsyn contains most (up to 90%) of the available free sulfhydryls in AChR-rich membranes. Accordingly, they selected a heterobifunctional cross-linker, SMPB, containingN-ethylmaleimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide as reactive groups, to selectively tether rapsyn to neighboring polypeptides. This reagent thus allows the exploration of the close environment of rapsyn in the membrane. In these conditions, most cross-linked products included rapsyn and extensive cross-linking among other membrane polypeptides was minimized. As the reagent was not cleavable, the composition of the polypeptide bands that appear following cross-linking was analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies against rapsyn and β-dystroglycan. At SMPB concentrations ranging from 10−6 to 10−5m, a few cross-linked products containing rapsyn did appear in immunoblots of purified AChR-rich membranes (Fig. 1). A major band at 110 kDa was previously identified as the rapsyn/AChR-β-subunit cross-linked product (Ref. 30Burden S.J. DePalma R.L. Gottesman G.S. Cell. 1983; 35: 687-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar and Fig. 1 A). Moreover, an additional 90-kDa band appeared following cross-linking on Western blots probed with anti-rapsyn antibody and revealed by ECL. This band was also immunolabeled by antibodies to β-dystroglycan and, therefore, represents a rapsyn/β-dystroglycan cross-linked product (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 3′ and Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, the apparent mass of this cross-linked product (=90 kDa) corresponds almost exactly to the sum of individual polypeptide masses of rapsyn and β-dystroglycan (43 and 46–50 kDa, respectively). The specificity of the immunodetections in these experiments was attested by the fact that the major cross-linked product at 110 kDa did not cross-react with the anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies and that only one additional cross-linked product at about 140 kDa was observed upon probing with anti-β-dystroglycan. This 140-kDa product did not cross-react with anti-rapsyn antibodies (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 3′). The 140-kDa product is presently still unidentified. To ascertain that the 90-kDa product indeed resulted from cross-linking between rapsyn and β-dystroglycan, the blots previously probed with the anti-β-dystroglycan antibody were stripped and reprobed with the anti-rapsyn antibody (Fig. 1 C). This experiment demonstrated that the 90-kDa product cross-reacted with both antibodies. Cross-linking with higher SMPB concentrations, i.e. with 10−4m, results in the complete disappearance of rapsyn at its usual position in SDS-PAGE, whereas there is a corresponding increase in a high molecular weight material at the top of the resolving and stacking gels (Fig. 1 A, lane 4′). In the same conditions only part of the β-dystroglycan was cross-linked (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). This indicates that only a fraction of dystroglycan undergoes cross-linking with rapsyn. Although cross-linking experiments do not provide the demonstration that the two proteins are indeed interacting, these experiments provide support for a close proximity between rapsyn and β-dystroglycan in the postsynaptic membrane. In an attempt to investigatein vitro the interaction between rapsyn and β-dystroglycan, we developed an affinity chromatography assay. Rabbit brain dystroglycan cDNA which showed high homology withTorpedo sequences (40Deyst K.A. Bowe M.A. Leszyk J.D. Fallon J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25956-25959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was digested, and two constructs containing β-dystroglycan C-terminal fragments corresponding to the juxtamembranous and distal cytoplasmic tail domains have been generated. The schematic representation of these two β-dystroglycan constructs (β-C2 and β-C3) is shown in Fig. 2 A. The two constructs cover almost the entire β-dystroglycan tail without redundancy. The purified fusion proteins have already been checked by SDS-PAGE and their molecular weights corresponded to that expected (see Ref. 28Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A few lower size bands were observed for each fusion protein. These products might result from incomplete translation or from a proteolytic cleavage occurring near the C terminus, even though fusion proteins have been produced in protease-deficient E. coli strain (see Ref. 28Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar for discussion). Binding of rapsyn to β-C2, β-C3 constructs and GST control was carried out using freshly solubilized rapsyn. The rapsyn from AChR-rich membranes was solubilized by an alkali treatment that efficiently dissociates rapsyn from the membrane as well as other components of the submembranous cytoskeleton (31Neubig R.R. Krodel E.K. Boyd N.D. Cohen J.B. Proc. Acad. Natl. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 690-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Following adjustment at pH 7.6 and centrifugation, the alkali extract (S11) was incubated for 2.5 h at 4 °C with the two constructs and with GST control immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B column. After extensive washings, the bound rapsyn was monitored by immunoblotting using mAb 1234 A anti-rapsyn antibody. As shown in Fig. 2 B, rapsyn was only recovered with the GST-β-C3-conjugated column. At variance, very low rapsyn recovery was obtained with GST-β-C2 or GST columns. However, as revealed by silver staining, several polypeptides were trapped together with rapsyn on the GST-β-C3 column (data not shown). This could eventually be attributed to the aggregation of alkali-extracted polypeptides with rapsyn as a consequence of adjustment to pH 7.6 before application to the column. Therefore, the specificity of binding of rapsyn to β-C3 remained to be demonstrated. This was carried out by ligand blot assays in order to ascertain the specificity of the interaction between rapsyn and dystroglycan. Ligand blot overlay assays were first performed with proteins from AChR-rich membrane separated by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. Blots were then probed for dystroglycan binding using the β-C2 and β-C3 constructs as well as a construct corresponding to the C-terminal domain of α-dystroglycan (ectodomain) and GST control (see “Experimental Procedures”). After incubation with the different constructs at 1 μm, the binding was revealed using anti-GST antibodies. A unique band corresponding to a protein with molecular weight very close to that of rapsyn was observed with the GST-β-C3 construct (Fig. 3 A). No signal was detected with the other constructs. When lower concentrations of β-C3 (i.e. 0.1 μm) were used in the assays, no signal was detected. Several proteins of the AChR-rich membrane are likely to display a molecular weight close to that of rapsyn in one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The demonstration that β-dystroglycan indeed binds to rapsyn was obtained with a two-dimensional ligand blot assay. As previously shown (41Gysin R. Yost B. Flanagan S.D. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5781-5789Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 42Porter S. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10034-10040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Froehner S.C. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 88: 88-96Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), rapsyn comprises several (three to four) isoelectric variants (pI = 6.9–7.5) displaying identical peptide maps and possibly resulting from phosphorylation (see Ref. 44Hill J.A. Nghiêm H.O. Changeux J.P. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5579-5585Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar for discussion). Fig. 3 B confirms that rapsyn extracted by LiS from AChR-rich membranes exhibits discrete isoelectric spots after two-dimensional separation, cross-reacting with the anti-rapsyn mAb 1234 A. The ligand blot assay performed with GST-β-C3, GST-β-C2, GST-ectodomain, and GST control (1 μm) demonstrates that GST-β-C3 binds to all rapsyn variants (Fig. 3 B). Again, no signal was obtained with the GST-Ecto and GST control constructs, attesting to the specificity of the binding. When considered with the results of the affinity chromatography experiments (see Fig. 2 B), a weak binding was also observed with GST-β-C2. We estimated this binding at 5–10% that obtained with GST-β-C3. In this work, we have shown that rapsyn is localized close to β-dystroglycan at the cytoplasmic aspect of the postsynaptic membrane of Torpedo electrocytes in situ and that it binds to β-dystroglycan in vitro. The cross-linker selected for this study which reacts both with available free sulfhydryls, essentially on rapsyn, and with primary amines on neighboring polypeptides is therefore particularly suitable for the exploration of the close environment of rapsyn in the postsynaptic membrane in situ. The observation that only one product (the 90-kDa) among a very few cross-linked products cross-reacted with both anti-rapsyn and anti-β-dystroglycan antibodies strongly favors the hypothesis that rapsyn and dystroglycan are intimately associated within the membrane. In good agreement with this in situ approach, in vitro binding experiments pointed out a domain of β-dystroglycan (the juxtamembranous cytoplasmic 787–819 residues) which specifically binds to rapsyn at micromolar concentration. Interestingly, as deduced from its primary sequence (see Ref. 21Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and references therein), the juxtamembranous domain of β-dystroglycan contains two clusters of lysine residues that likely account for the efficient cross-linking to rapsyn by SMPB. Our experiments thus suggests that the interaction between rapsyn and dystroglycan observed in vitro also occurs in situ. This is in full agreement with the co-distribution of the two proteins at the cytoplasmic side of the postsynaptic membrane in Torpedo electrocyte (19Cartaud A. Ludosky M.A. Haaseman M. Jung D. Campbell K.P. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1837-1846PubMed Google Scholar). At variance with rapsyn which is totally cross-linked at a high concentration of SMPB, only part of dystroglycan can be cross-linked in the same conditions. This may indicate that only a fraction of dystroglycan molecules are engaged in interaction with rapsyn. Very few cross-linking products containing β-dystroglycan were observed in the resolving gels. Thus, our cross-linking experiments do not allow us to assess whether α-dystroglycan, dystrophin, or Grb2 were cross-linked with β-dystroglycan. In fact, the cross-linking agent used in this study was not designed to explore the environment of β-dystroglycan but rather that of rapsyn. Taken together, our results raise the possibility that distinct dystroglycan complexes may exist in the postsynaptic membrane. Moreover, since rapsyn is absent from extrasynaptic sarcolemma, one could postulate that several dystroglycan complexes, differing with their association with various partners, are confined to different domains of the sarcolemma. At the synapse, the rapsyn dystroglycan interaction could likely be involved in the clustering of AChR. The ability of dystroglycans to establish multiple interactions with partners from both inside and outside the cell places these molecules at a central position in sarcolemmal organization. Dystroglycans directly contribute to the connection of the extracellular matrix with the actin-based cytoskeleton. Several signal transducing molecules, such as Grb2 (45Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) or nitric-oxide synthase (46Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar), have been reported to associate with the DGC. However neither Grb2 nor NOS are part of the DGC sensu stricto. The present data further emphasize the property of the DGC to associate weakly and/or transiently with a variety of physiological partners in order to mediate various signals. In the synaptic membrane, the present experiments show that DGC associates with AChR via rapsyn. However, these two proteins do not co-purify with DGC after detergent extraction (38Cartaud A. Stetzkowski-Marden F. Cartaud J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13019-13022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 47Butler M.H. Douville K. Murnane A.A. Kramarcy N.R. Cohen J.B. Sealock R. Froehner S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6213-6218Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), perhaps pointing to a loose association. Thus, the DGC is likely to play many more functions than previously thought. Furthermore, dedicated regions of the cytoplasmic tail of β-dystroglycan are respectively engaged in the binding of dystrophin/apodystrophin (amino acids 880–895, see Refs. 28Rosa G. Ceccarini M. Cavaldesi M. Zini M. Petrucci T.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 223: 272-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar and 48Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), Grb2 (proline-rich domains, see Ref. 45Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), and rapsyn (amino acids 787–819, this work, Fig. 4). In addition, α-dystroglycan binds merosin or agrin depending of its cellular localization (see Ref. 21Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar and references therein). As such, dystroglycan appears as the pivotal element in the DGC. In skeletal muscle fibers, the interaction of DGC with rapsyn only takes place at the postsynaptic membrane, whereas dystroglycan is distributed in extrasynaptic regions as well. A plausible hypothesis is that neural cues, i.e. agrin signaling, may locally alter the associations between dystroglycan and rapsyn, thus leading to the differentiation of the postsynaptic membrane domain. Tyrosine phosphorylation on proteins are known to be involved in the signaling cascade triggered by the nerve ultimately leading to AChR clustering (49Wallace B.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1121-1129Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 50Ferns M.J. Deiner M. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 937-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Interestingly, β-dystroglycan possesses several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (21Henry M.D. Campbell K.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 45Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation may modulate the interaction with rapsyn. Several lines of evidence point to a role of the DGC in AChR clustering. Dystrophin/utrophin and components of the DGC, in particular α/β dystroglycan, co-distribute with AChR clusters both in vivo and in vitro. In co-cultured nerve and muscle cells derived from Xenopus embryos, Cohenet al. (18Cohen M.W. Jacobson C. Godrey E.W. Campbell K.P. Carbonetto S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1093-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) reported that dystroglycan associated with synaptic as well as nonsynaptic AChR clusters and that it underwent the same nerve-induced changes in distribution as AChR. Also, during earlyTorpedo embryonic development, we observed that AChR accumulates concomitantly with dystrophin and dystroglycan in the ventral plasma membrane domain of developing electrocytes (19Cartaud A. Ludosky M.A. Haaseman M. Jung D. Campbell K.P. Cartaud J. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1837-1846PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, co-transfection experiments in quail fibroblasts with recombinant AChR, rapsyn, and dystroglycan show that these proteins form stable complexes in the membrane and that rapsyn can cluster AChR and dystroglycan independently (26Apel D.A. Roberds S.L. Campbell K.P. Merlie J.P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 115-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, utrophin-dystrophin-deficient mice that display severe progressive muscular dystrophy have moderately affected neuromuscular junctions (51Deconinck A.E. Rafael J.A. Skinner J.A. Brown S.C. Potter A.C. Metzinger L. Watt D.J. Dickson J.G. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 52Grady R.M. Teng H. Nichol M.C. Cunningham J.C. Wilkinson R.S. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1997; 90: 729-738Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Thus, synaptic differentiation could occur in the absence of dystrophin and utrophin. In these double knock-out mice, as reported by Deconinck et al. (51Deconinck A.E. Rafael J.A. Skinner J.A. Brown S.C. Potter A.C. Metzinger L. Watt D.J. Dickson J.G. Tinsley J.M. Davies K.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 717-727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar), dystrophin-associated proteins β2-syntrophin and β-dystroglycan are retained at the NMJ, suggesting that these components might be required for AChR clustering. In this context, the present data support the notion that rapsyn-β-dystroglycan interaction is involved in synaptic differentiation. The agrin signaling pathway at the NMJ has been the focus of intensive investigation in the past few years. Agrin has been shown to bind to α-dystroglycan with high affinity (for a review, see Ref. 53Bowe M.A. Fallon J.R. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 443-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that dystroglycan plays a critical role in agrin signaling at the neuromuscular junction. This hypothesis is inconsistent in light of the observation that the domain of agrin involved in binding to α-dystroglycan is distinct from the part of agrin molecule that induces AChR clustering (24Gesemann M. Cavalli V. Denzer A.J. Brancaccio A. Schumacher B. Ruegg M.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 755-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 25Hopf C. Hoch W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5231-5236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At variance, the MuSK receptor complex is likely to represent at least part of the signaling agrin receptor involved in AChR clustering via a cascade of phosphorylations. The recent observations of Apel et al.(13Apel D.E. Glass D.J. Moscoso L.M. Yancopoulos G.D. Sanes J.R. Neuron. 1997; 18: 623-635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) point to a model in which rapsyn has multiple interactions with MuSK and that rapsyn, in addition to its structural role, is required in an early step in MuSK signaling leading to AChR clustering. Our present data raise the attractive hypothesis that dystroglycan is part of the MuSK signaling pathway via its interaction with rapsyn. We thank Dr. S.

Syringomycin E is a member of a family of cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by strains of the plant bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (1Takemoto J.Y. Verma D.S. Bacterial Phytotoxin Syringomycin and Its Interaction with Host Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 247-260Google Scholar). Traditionally regarded as a virulence factor in a variety of bacterial necrotic diseases of plants (2Gross D. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1991; 29: 247-278Crossref Google Scholar), syringomycin E and its analogs also possess antifungal properties, and it has been suggested that these metabolites are fungal antagonists that aid survival of the producing bacteria on plants (3Hrabak E.M. Willis D.K. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 368-375Crossref Google Scholar, 4Adetuyi F.C. Isogai A. Giorgio D.D. Ballio A. Takemoto J.Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 63-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).How these compounds produce their toxic effects is unknown, but past physiological studies have shown that syringomycin E targets primarily the plasma membrane (1Takemoto J.Y. Verma D.S. Bacterial Phytotoxin Syringomycin and Its Interaction with Host Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 247-260Google Scholar, 5Hutchison M.L. Tester M.A. Gross D.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Zhang L. Takemoto J.Y. Phytopathology. 1987; 77: 297-303Crossref Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of this bioactive compound, resistant mutants ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated to identify genes that encode proteins necessary for growth inhibition by syringomycin E (7Takemoto J.Y. Yu Y. Stock S.D. Miyakawa T. FEMS Lett. 1993; 114: 339-342Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several of the mutants were deficient in sterols, and one group was complemented by the gene SYR1 (identical toERG3), which encodes sterol C-5,6 desaturase of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (8Taguchi N. Takano Y. Julmanop C. Wang Y. Stock S. Takemoto J. Miyakawa T. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings, when combined with results from binding (9Julmanop C. Takano Y. Takemoto J.Y. Miyakawa T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and lipid bilayer (10Feigin A.M. Schagina L.V. Takemoto J.Y. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) studies, indicate that sterols influence the interaction of syringomycin E with the target plasma membrane.Syringomycin E action in yeast was more recently shown to require a second, nonsterol biosynthetic gene, SYR2 (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar).SYR2 is identical to SUR2, which was identified in a screen for mutants that suppress the impaired recovery ofrvs161 strains from nutritional starvation (12Desfarges L. Durrens P. Jugelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Syringomycin E-resistant syr2 mutants showed altered glycerophospholipid levels, and the SYR2 gene product was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise function of Syr2p was unclear from these studies.In addition to sterols and glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids are major lipid components of the plasma membrane (13van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, sphingolipids all possess a sphingoid long chain base with mainly, in fungi and plants, a hydroxyl group at the C-4 position (phytosphingosine) or, in animals, a double bond at the C-4,5 position (sphingosine). Sphingolipids serve numerous roles, including mediating cell-cell interactions, anchoring membrane proteins, acting as enzyme co-factors (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), and serving as receptors for Escherichia coli verotoxin (15Fishman P.H. Pacuszka T. Orlandi P.A. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 25: 165-187PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lingwood C.A. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 189-211PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lingwood C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, sphingolipids are becoming recognized as significant players in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and response to stress through the second messenger action of sphingolipid metabolites sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 19Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, numerous gaps remain in the knowledge of sphingolipid metabolism, including the nature of the enzymes directly responsible for phytoceramide or ceramide formation from the presumed immediate precursor dihydroceramide (Fig. 1) (21Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).In this report we present evidence that S. cerevisiae SYR2is required for 4-hydroxylation of sphingoid bases and that this activity is necessary for syringomycin E action. We show that strains mutant in SYR2 produce sphingolipids missing the hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of the long chain base moiety, that supplying such cells with C-4 hydroxylated long chain base suppresses the syringomycin E-resistant phenotype of syr2 strains, and that strains that overexpress Syr2p are enriched in 4-hydroxylase activity.DISCUSSIONThe present study of yeast gene SYR2 reveals that sphingolipids play a key role in the action of the antifungal syringomycin E. It also uncovers a previously uncharacterized activity of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. The lack of PHS-based sphingolipids and accumulation of DHS-based sphingolipids in syringomycin E-resistant syr2 mutants, the greater 4-hydroxylase activity in a SYR2 overexpression strain, the lack of activity in a syr2 mutant strain, and the ability to bypass the syr2 defect with exogenously added PHS provide support for a biosynthetic role of Syr2p in 4-hydroxylation of sphingoid bases. In addition, the sequence similarity of Syr2p to membrane hydroxylases and desaturases and its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the site of early sphingolipid biosynthetic steps (41Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Assembly of Sphingolipids into Membranes of the Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H82. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1994: 23-31Google Scholar), suggest that Syr2p is the enzyme that catalyzes this specific hydroxylation step. An essential catalytic role in fatty acid hydroxylation is not likely because very long chain fatty acid hydroxylation was still detected in the syr2 mutant despite a complete loss of SYR2 transcripts (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). While this report was in preparation, Haak et al. (42Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported that an independent sur2/syr2 mutant produces sphingolipids lacking long chain base 4-hydroxylation, whereas a second gene product, Scs7p, is required for sphingolipid very long chain fatty acid hydroxylation.Identification of Syr2p as the sphingolipid 4-hydroxylase will pave the way for isolation and characterization of the enzyme. This will, in turn, permit clarification of several issues regarding sphingolipid biosynthesis. One important question concerns the identity of the lipid substrate of Syr2p. The analogous reaction in animal cells, desaturation at the C-4 position, is thought to occur at the level of dihydroceramide (43Geeraert L. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, it is not known if 4-hydroxylation occurs before or after long chain base acylation,i.e. if Syr2p converts DHS to PHS, dihydroceramide to phytoceramide, or both (Fig. 1). Inhibition of ceramide synthesis leads to accumulation of both DHS and PHS (44Wu W.-I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45Oh C.-S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct conversion from DHS to PHS is possible, at least under conditions of limited ceramide formation. We have shown that incubation of either DHS or dihydroceramide with microsomes from a SYR2overexpressing strain leads to hydroxylation. With crude microsome preparations, however, enzymes capable of catalyzing acylation or deacylation of the added substrate before hydroxylation may be present and obscure the true nature of the substrate.Confirmation that Syr2p is in fact an iron-containing oxidative enzyme as predicted from the sequence (Fig. 2) will also be afforded by biochemical analysis. The stimulation of 4-hydroxylase activity by reduced pyridine nucleotide, as shown here, is consistent with Syr2p being a member of this enzyme family. Molecular oxygen has been shown to be the main source of oxygen added to dihydroceramide (46Kulmacz R.J. Schroepfer G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 3963-3964Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but little else is known of the mechanism of this reaction. Knowledge about Syr2p will also reveal mechanisms about mammalian sphingolipid biosynthesis. Phytoceramide is produced by certain mammalian tissues (47Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by fungi and plants, and these tissues are predicted to contain a Syr2p homolog. The primary mammalian sphingolipids based on ceramide contain the long chain base sphingosine, which has a C-4,5 double bond rather than the 4-hydroxyl group. Recent reports concerning the enzyme in rats that catalyzes this reaction, dihydroceramide desaturase, suggest it also has properties similar to diiron-containing lipid desaturases and hydroxylases (43Geeraert L. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 48Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).How sphingolipids, and more specifically sphingolipid 4-hydroxylation, allow susceptibility to syringomycin E can only be speculated. One possibility is that 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids directly bind this antifungal compound at the cell surface. The 4-hydroxyl group is expected to influence the degree of sphingolipid exposure on the membrane surface, but it will also affect lipid and protein nearest neighbor interactions in the plane of the membrane. Another possibility is that 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids indirectly influence syringomycin E-cell interaction by modulating sterol or glycerophospholipid compositions or both. Syringomycin E action is influenced by sterols (8Taguchi N. Takano Y. Julmanop C. Wang Y. Stock S. Takemoto J. Miyakawa T. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Feigin A.M. Schagina L.V. Takemoto J.Y. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), phospholipid bilayers facilitate ion channel formation by syringomycin E molecules (49Feigin A.M. Takemoto J.Y. Wangspa R. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and syr2mutants have lowered cellular glycerophospholipid levels (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite evidence for cross-regulation of the biosynthetic pathways of these various lipid classes in yeast (50Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to predict precisely how an alteration in the hydroxylation state of sphingolipids could influence cellular sterol and phospholipid composition. Furthermore, 4-hydroxylation could influence the insertion and assembly of lipids as well as proteins into the plasma membrane. Finally, the requirement for sphingolipid 4-hydroxylation may reflect the involvement of phytoceramide-mediated growth inhibition processes in syringomycin E action. Phytoceramide and ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, are reported to mediate cell death in animal cells and growth inhibition in yeast (18Hannun Y.A.

Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Exposure of yeast cells to syringomycin E may cause increased cellular levels of phytoceramide (perhaps by activating sphingolipid turnover), which in turn may activate specific protein kinases and phosphatases (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 51Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Without the ability to hydroxylate dihydroceramide to phytoceramide and the consequent substitution of dihydroceramide into mature sphingolipids, syr2 mutants would be incapable of undergoing this process.The observation that SYR2 encodes a nonessential function raises questions about the cellular roles of 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids in yeast growth and survival. Normal SYR2strains produce sphingolipids that are based almost exclusively on phytoceramide (this study and Ref. 54Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but syr2 mutants grow well with dihydroceramide-based sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are indicated to be required for maintaining proton permeability barriers across the membrane or for proton extrusion (55Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and for maturation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (56Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary observations, however, show that syr2 mutants display wild type growth phenotypes under conditions where proper functioning of these processes may be essential, namely at acidic pHs (4.1), high temperatures (39 °C), and high salt concentrations (0.75m NaCl). 3J. Y. Takemoto, unpublished results. Also, Calcofluor staining of chitin, a probe of cell wall structure, was unperturbed in the syr2 mutant, although growth of thesyr2 mutant was slightly retarded by Calcofluor. 4M. M. Grilley and J. Y. Takemoto, unpublished results. The two phenotypes previously associated with syr2/sur2mutations, resistance to syringomycin E, and suppression ofrvs161 mutations can now be said to be associated with a loss of 4-hydroxylation of the long chain base moiety of sphingolipids. The only apparent commonality of these two phenotypes is growth restoration under conditions that inhibit growth of wild type cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for these effects await elucidation, as does a clear definition of the role of 4-hydroxy-sphingolipids in yeast biology and syringomycin E action. Syringomycin E is a member of a family of cyclic lipodepsipeptides produced by strains of the plant bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (1Takemoto J.Y. Verma D.S. Bacterial Phytotoxin Syringomycin and Its Interaction with Host Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 247-260Google Scholar). Traditionally regarded as a virulence factor in a variety of bacterial necrotic diseases of plants (2Gross D. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1991; 29: 247-278Crossref Google Scholar), syringomycin E and its analogs also possess antifungal properties, and it has been suggested that these metabolites are fungal antagonists that aid survival of the producing bacteria on plants (3Hrabak E.M. Willis D.K. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1993; 6: 368-375Crossref Google Scholar, 4Adetuyi F.C. Isogai A. Giorgio D.D. Ballio A. Takemoto J.Y. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1995; 131: 63-67Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). How these compounds produce their toxic effects is unknown, but past physiological studies have shown that syringomycin E targets primarily the plasma membrane (1Takemoto J.Y. Verma D.S. Bacterial Phytotoxin Syringomycin and Its Interaction with Host Membranes. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 247-260Google Scholar, 5Hutchison M.L. Tester M.A. Gross D.C. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1995; 8: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 6Zhang L. Takemoto J.Y. Phytopathology. 1987; 77: 297-303Crossref Google Scholar). To further investigate the molecular mechanisms of action of this bioactive compound, resistant mutants ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae were isolated to identify genes that encode proteins necessary for growth inhibition by syringomycin E (7Takemoto J.Y. Yu Y. Stock S.D. Miyakawa T. FEMS Lett. 1993; 114: 339-342Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several of the mutants were deficient in sterols, and one group was complemented by the gene SYR1 (identical toERG3), which encodes sterol C-5,6 desaturase of the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway (8Taguchi N. Takano Y. Julmanop C. Wang Y. Stock S. Takemoto J. Miyakawa T. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These findings, when combined with results from binding (9Julmanop C. Takano Y. Takemoto J.Y. Miyakawa T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1993; 139: 2323-2327Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and lipid bilayer (10Feigin A.M. Schagina L.V. Takemoto J.Y. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) studies, indicate that sterols influence the interaction of syringomycin E with the target plasma membrane. Syringomycin E action in yeast was more recently shown to require a second, nonsterol biosynthetic gene, SYR2 (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar).SYR2 is identical to SUR2, which was identified in a screen for mutants that suppress the impaired recovery ofrvs161 strains from nutritional starvation (12Desfarges L. Durrens P. Jugelin H. Cassagne C. Bonneu M. Aigle M. Yeast. 1993; 9: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Syringomycin E-resistant syr2 mutants showed altered glycerophospholipid levels, and the SYR2 gene product was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the precise function of Syr2p was unclear from these studies. In addition to sterols and glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids are major lipid components of the plasma membrane (13van der Rest M.E. Kamminga A.H. Nakano A. Anraku Y. Poolman B. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 304-322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ubiquitous in eukaryotic cells, sphingolipids all possess a sphingoid long chain base with mainly, in fungi and plants, a hydroxyl group at the C-4 position (phytosphingosine) or, in animals, a double bond at the C-4,5 position (sphingosine). Sphingolipids serve numerous roles, including mediating cell-cell interactions, anchoring membrane proteins, acting as enzyme co-factors (14Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 500-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar), and serving as receptors for Escherichia coli verotoxin (15Fishman P.H. Pacuszka T. Orlandi P.A. Adv. Lipid. Res. 1993; 25: 165-187PubMed Google Scholar, 16Lingwood C.A. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 189-211PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lingwood C.A. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 147-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In addition, sphingolipids are becoming recognized as significant players in the control of cell growth, differentiation, and response to stress through the second messenger action of sphingolipid metabolites sphingosine, sphingosine-1-phosphate, and ceramide (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 19Dickson R.C. Nagiec E.E. Skrzypek M. Tillman P. Wells G.B. Lester R.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32566-32572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Despite their importance, numerous gaps remain in the knowledge of sphingolipid metabolism, including the nature of the enzymes directly responsible for phytoceramide or ceramide formation from the presumed immediate precursor dihydroceramide (Fig. 1) (21Merrill Jr., A.H. Wang E. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 209: 427-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this report we present evidence that S. cerevisiae SYR2is required for 4-hydroxylation of sphingoid bases and that this activity is necessary for syringomycin E action. We show that strains mutant in SYR2 produce sphingolipids missing the hydroxyl group at the C-4 position of the long chain base moiety, that supplying such cells with C-4 hydroxylated long chain base suppresses the syringomycin E-resistant phenotype of syr2 strains, and that strains that overexpress Syr2p are enriched in 4-hydroxylase activity. DISCUSSIONThe present study of yeast gene SYR2 reveals that sphingolipids play a key role in the action of the antifungal syringomycin E. It also uncovers a previously uncharacterized activity of the sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. The lack of PHS-based sphingolipids and accumulation of DHS-based sphingolipids in syringomycin E-resistant syr2 mutants, the greater 4-hydroxylase activity in a SYR2 overexpression strain, the lack of activity in a syr2 mutant strain, and the ability to bypass the syr2 defect with exogenously added PHS provide support for a biosynthetic role of Syr2p in 4-hydroxylation of sphingoid bases. In addition, the sequence similarity of Syr2p to membrane hydroxylases and desaturases and its localization in the endoplasmic reticulum (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the site of early sphingolipid biosynthetic steps (41Hechtberger P. Zinser E. Paltauf F. Daum G. Op den Kamp J.A.F. Assembly of Sphingolipids into Membranes of the Yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. H82. Springer-Verlag, Berlin, Germany1994: 23-31Google Scholar), suggest that Syr2p is the enzyme that catalyzes this specific hydroxylation step. An essential catalytic role in fatty acid hydroxylation is not likely because very long chain fatty acid hydroxylation was still detected in the syr2 mutant despite a complete loss of SYR2 transcripts (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). While this report was in preparation, Haak et al. (42Haak D. Gable K. Beeler T. Dunn T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29704-29710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) reported that an independent sur2/syr2 mutant produces sphingolipids lacking long chain base 4-hydroxylation, whereas a second gene product, Scs7p, is required for sphingolipid very long chain fatty acid hydroxylation.Identification of Syr2p as the sphingolipid 4-hydroxylase will pave the way for isolation and characterization of the enzyme. This will, in turn, permit clarification of several issues regarding sphingolipid biosynthesis. One important question concerns the identity of the lipid substrate of Syr2p. The analogous reaction in animal cells, desaturation at the C-4 position, is thought to occur at the level of dihydroceramide (43Geeraert L. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In yeast, however, it is not known if 4-hydroxylation occurs before or after long chain base acylation,i.e. if Syr2p converts DHS to PHS, dihydroceramide to phytoceramide, or both (Fig. 1). Inhibition of ceramide synthesis leads to accumulation of both DHS and PHS (44Wu W.-I. McDonough V.M. Nickels Jr., J.T. Ko J. Fischl A.S. Vales T.R. Merrill Jr., A.H. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13171-13178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 45Oh C.-S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), suggesting a direct conversion from DHS to PHS is possible, at least under conditions of limited ceramide formation. We have shown that incubation of either DHS or dihydroceramide with microsomes from a SYR2overexpressing strain leads to hydroxylation. With crude microsome preparations, however, enzymes capable of catalyzing acylation or deacylation of the added substrate before hydroxylation may be present and obscure the true nature of the substrate.Confirmation that Syr2p is in fact an iron-containing oxidative enzyme as predicted from the sequence (Fig. 2) will also be afforded by biochemical analysis. The stimulation of 4-hydroxylase activity by reduced pyridine nucleotide, as shown here, is consistent with Syr2p being a member of this enzyme family. Molecular oxygen has been shown to be the main source of oxygen added to dihydroceramide (46Kulmacz R.J. Schroepfer G.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 3963-3964Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), but little else is known of the mechanism of this reaction. Knowledge about Syr2p will also reveal mechanisms about mammalian sphingolipid biosynthesis. Phytoceramide is produced by certain mammalian tissues (47Hakomori S. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5309-5318PubMed Google Scholar) as well as by fungi and plants, and these tissues are predicted to contain a Syr2p homolog. The primary mammalian sphingolipids based on ceramide contain the long chain base sphingosine, which has a C-4,5 double bond rather than the 4-hydroxyl group. Recent reports concerning the enzyme in rats that catalyzes this reaction, dihydroceramide desaturase, suggest it also has properties similar to diiron-containing lipid desaturases and hydroxylases (43Geeraert L. Mannaerts G.P. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 48Michel C. van Echten-Deckert G. Rother J. Sandhoff K. Wang E. Merrill Jr., A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22432-22437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar).How sphingolipids, and more specifically sphingolipid 4-hydroxylation, allow susceptibility to syringomycin E can only be speculated. One possibility is that 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids directly bind this antifungal compound at the cell surface. The 4-hydroxyl group is expected to influence the degree of sphingolipid exposure on the membrane surface, but it will also affect lipid and protein nearest neighbor interactions in the plane of the membrane. Another possibility is that 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids indirectly influence syringomycin E-cell interaction by modulating sterol or glycerophospholipid compositions or both. Syringomycin E action is influenced by sterols (8Taguchi N. Takano Y. Julmanop C. Wang Y. Stock S. Takemoto J. Miyakawa T. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 353-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Feigin A.M. Schagina L.V. Takemoto J.Y. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 102-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), phospholipid bilayers facilitate ion channel formation by syringomycin E molecules (49Feigin A.M. Takemoto J.Y. Wangspa R. Teeter J.H. Brand J.G. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 149: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and syr2mutants have lowered cellular glycerophospholipid levels (11Cliften P. Wang Y. Mochizuki D. Miyakawa T. Wangspa R. Hughes J. Takemoto J.Y. Microbiology. 1996; 147: 477-484Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Despite evidence for cross-regulation of the biosynthetic pathways of these various lipid classes in yeast (50Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to predict precisely how an alteration in the hydroxylation state of sphingolipids could influence cellular sterol and phospholipid composition. Furthermore, 4-hydroxylation could influence the insertion and assembly of lipids as well as proteins into the plasma membrane. Finally, the requirement for sphingolipid 4-hydroxylation may reflect the involvement of phytoceramide-mediated growth inhibition processes in syringomycin E action. Phytoceramide and ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, are reported to mediate cell death in animal cells and growth inhibition in yeast (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 51Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Despite evidence for cross-regulation of the biosynthetic pathways of these various lipid classes in yeast (50Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is difficult to predict precisely how an alteration in the hydroxylation state of sphingolipids could influence cellular sterol and phospholipid composition. Furthermore, 4-hydroxylation could influence the insertion and assembly of lipids as well as proteins into the plasma membrane. Finally, the requirement for sphingolipid 4-hydroxylation may reflect the involvement of phytoceramide-mediated growth inhibition processes in syringomycin E action. Phytoceramide and ceramide, but not dihydroceramide, are reported to mediate cell death in animal cells and growth inhibition in yeast (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 51Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 382-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), although the phenomenon is not always observed (53Ella K.M. Qi C. Dolan J.W. Thompson R.P. Meier K.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 340: 101-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Exposure of yeast cells to syringomycin E may cause increased cellular levels of phytoceramide (perhaps by activating sphingolipid turnover), which in turn may activate specific protein kinases and phosphatases (18Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar, 51Fishbein J.D. Dobrowsky R.T. Bielawska A. Garrett S. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Without the ability to hydroxylate dihydroceramide to phytoceramide and the consequent substitution of dihydroceramide into mature sphingolipids, syr2 mutants would be incapable of undergoing this process. The observation that SYR2 encodes a nonessential function raises questions about the cellular roles of 4-hydroxylated sphingolipids in yeast growth and survival. Normal SYR2strains produce sphingolipids that are based almost exclusively on phytoceramide (this study and Ref. 54Smith S.W. Lester R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 3395-3405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but syr2 mutants grow well with dihydroceramide-based sphingolipids. Sphingolipids are indicated to be required for maintaining proton permeability barriers across the membrane or for proton extrusion (55Patton J.L. Srinivasan B. Dickson R.C. Lester R.L. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 7180-7184Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) and for maturation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (56Skrzypek M. Lester R.L. Dickson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1513-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preliminary observations, however, show that syr2 mutants display wild type growth phenotypes under conditions where proper functioning of these processes may be essential, namely at acidic pHs (4.1), high temperatures (39 °C), and high salt concentrations (0.75m NaCl). 3J. Y. Takemoto, unpublished results. Also, Calcofluor staining of chitin, a probe of cell wall structure, was unperturbed in the syr2 mutant, although growth of thesyr2 mutant was slightly retarded by Calcofluor. 4M. M. Grilley and J. Y. Takemoto, unpublished results. The two phenotypes previously associated with syr2/sur2mutations, resistance to syringomycin E, and suppression ofrvs161 mutations can now be said to be associated with a loss of 4-hydroxylation of the long chain base moiety of sphingolipids. The only apparent commonality of these two phenotypes is growth restoration under conditions that inhibit growth of wild type cells. The mechanism(s) responsible for these effects await elucidation, as does a clear definition of the role of 4-hydroxy-sphingolipids in yeast biology and syringomycin E action.

https://openalex.org/W2092147306,"The amino-terminal 8-kDa domain of DNA polymerase β functions in binding single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), recognition of a 5′-phosphate in gapped DNA structures, and as a 5′-deoxyribose phosphate (dRP) lyase. NMR and x-ray crystal structures of this domain have suggested several residues that may interact with ssDNA or play a role in the dRP lyase reaction. Nine of these residues were altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Each mutant was expressed inEscherichia coli, and the recombinant protein was purified to near homogeneity. CD spectra of these mutant proteins indicated that the alteration did not adversely affect the global protein structure. Single-stranded DNA binding was probed by photochemical cross-linking to oligo(dT)16. Several mutants (F25W, K35A, K60A, and K68A) were impaired in ssDNA binding activity, whereas other mutants (H34G, E71Q, K72A, E75A, and K84A) retained near wild-type binding activity. The 5′-phosphate recognition activity of these mutants was examined by UV cross-linking to a 5-nucleotide gap DNA where the 5′ terminus in the gap was either phosphorylated or unphosphorylated. The results indicate that Lys35 is involved in 5′-phosphate recognition of DNA polymerase β. Finally, the dRP lyase activity of these mutants was evaluated using a preincised apurinic/apyrimidinic DNA. Alanine mutants of Lys35 and Lys60 are significantly reduced in dRP lyase activity, consistent with the lower ssDNA binding activity. More importantly, alanine substitution for Lys72 resulted in a greater than 90% loss of dRP lyase activity, without affecting DNA binding. Alanine mutants of Lys68 and Lys84 had wild-type dRP lyase activity. The triple alanine mutant, K35A/K68A/K72A, was devoid of dRP lyase activity, suggesting that the effects of the alanine substitution at Lys72 and Lys35 were additive. The results suggest that Lys72 is directly involved in formation of a covalent imino intermediate and are consistent with Lys72as the predominant Schiff base nucleophile in the dRP lyase β-elimination catalytic reaction.

Genomic DNA is constantly exposed to various endogenous and external environmental agents leading to DNA base loss and/or damage. To remove such damage and retain genome stability, the base excision DNA repair pathway has been maintained in essentially all organisms. Base excision repair was initially described in Escherichia coli (1Franklin W.A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3617-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and later in mammalian cells (2Price A. Lindahl T. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 8631-8637Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This repair pathway is initiated by enzymatic removal of an inappropriate base or spontaneous hydrolysis of bases through cleavage of the N-glycosyl bond (3Lindahl T. Nyberg B. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3405-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 4Doetsch P.W. Helland D.E. Haseltine W.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2212-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The resulting apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) 1The abbreviations used are: AP, apurinic/apyrimidinic; β-pol, DNA polymerase β; dRP, 2′-deoxyribose 5′-phosphate; HhH, Helix-hairpin-Helix; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; UDG, uracil-DNA glycosylase; ssDNA, single-stranded DNA; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. site is cleaved by a class II AP endonuclease (5Doetsch P.W.

To complete repair, the dRP moiety is removed so that a single-nucleotide gap with a 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-phosphate is generated (6Franklin W.A. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 8631-8637Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase β (β-pol) replaces the missing nucleotide (7Dianov G. Price A. Lindahl T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1605-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 8Dianov G. Lindahl T. Curr.

These enzymatic activities should be coordinated for efficient base excision repair. β-pol is a multifunctional enzyme consisting of an 8-kDa amino-terminal domain with dRP lyase activity (11Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 12Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and a 31-kDa carboxyl-terminal domain with nucleotidyltransferase activity (13Kumar A. Abbotts J. Karawya E.M. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7156-7159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The crystal and solution structures of the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain have been determined (14Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Science. 1994; 264: 1891-1903Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The 8-kDa domain (residues 1–87) is formed by four α-helices, packed as two antiparallel pairs. The pairs of α-helices cross one another at 50° giving them a V-like shape (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar,16Liu D.-J. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The 8-kDa domain of β-pol also contains a motif termed “Helix-hairpin-Helix” (HhH) (17Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). This motif has been found in a number of DNA repair proteins, including several DNA glycosylases and AP lyases (18Seeberg E. Edie L Bjør[ang]as M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Residues of the HhH motif have been proposed to contribute to recognition and excision of damaged nucleotides in DNA, as well as AP lyase chemistry (18Seeberg E. Edie L Bjør[ang]as M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 391-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 19Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4713-4717Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Alignment of the HhH motifs from β-pol and endonuclease III suggest that β-pol Lys68 may be critically important in lyase chemistry since mutation of the analogous lysine residue in endonuclease III, Lys120, resulted in a dramatic reduction ink cat (20Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Furthermore, β-pol protein residues involved in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) binding have been identified by NMR using chemical shift changes (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The Helix-3-hairpin-Helix-4 motif and residues in an adjacent Ω-type loop form the ssDNA interaction surface (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Liu D.-J. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of β-pol bound to a template-primer substrate suggested that four lysine residues (residues 35, 68, 72, and 84) in this region of the protein coordinate the DNA 5′-phosphate that may exist in a gapped DNA (17Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, in structures of β-pol bound to a one-nucleotide DNA gap only Lys35 and Lys68 coordinate the 5′-phosphate in the short gap (21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Based on information available from the crystal and NMR structures of the 8-kDa domain and from biochemical studies of the protein (14Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. Kraut J.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we have now conducted site-directed mutagenesis to alter 9 residues in the 8-kDa domain of β-pol that appear to contribute key interactions to ssDNA binding, 5′-phosphate recognition in a DNA gap, and dRP lyase activity. The results allow us to identify two critical residues, Lys35and Lys72, for 5′-phosphate recognition and dRP lyase chemistry, respectively. Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by HPLC were obtained from Operon Technologies, Inc. Unphosphorylated oligodeoxythymidylate, (dT)16, was from Pharmacia. [α-32P]ddATP and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from Promega. Human AP endonuclease and uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), with 84 amino acids deleted from the amino terminus, were purified as described (23Strauss P.R. Beard W.A. Patterson T. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1302-1307Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 24Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharti S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a procedure described previously (25Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). Recombinant amino-terminal 8-kDa domain and the mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified as described (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For CD analysis, the wild-type 8-kDa domain of β-pol and the mutants were further purified by gel filtration on HPLC using a Bio-Sel SEC-125 (300 × 7.8 mm) size exclusion column (Bio-Rad). Buffer consisted of 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, and 500 mm NaCl. The chromatogram for the mutants was compared with the chromatogram of the highly purified wild-type 8-kDa domain in selecting the pooled peak fraction for each mutant. The concentrations of the mutant proteins were determined by UV absorption at 280 nm (ε280 = 5440m−1 cm−1). CD measurements were performed on a Jasco J715 spectropolarimeter in a 1-cm cell at 25 °C. The CD spectra were collected from 260 to 200 nm at a resolution of 1 nm using up to 8 scans. The per residue molar ellipticity (deg·cm2 dmol−1) was calculated from the concentration for the 87-residue polypeptide. Unphosphorylated oligodeoxyribonucleotide (P1) was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase using [γ-32P]ATP as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 11.31Google Scholar, 27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lyophilized oligonucleotides were resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 1 mmEDTA, and the concentrations were determined from their UV absorbance at 260 nm. Template-primers were annealed as described previously (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence of the 5-nucleotide gapped DNA used was as follows. Purified wild-type 8-kDa domain or the mutant protein (1.4 μm) was mixed with the gapped DNA template-primer (0.7 μm) in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2 and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were irradiated, and the photochemical cross-linked 8-kDa protein-DNA complexes were separated and analyzed as described (28Mullen G.P. Antuch W. Maciejewski M.W. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 35: 12057-12066Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The relative activities were determined by the ability of the mutant 8-kDa domain to discriminate between a 5′-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated terminus in a gap as compared with wild-type protein. The wild-type 8-kDa binds to a 5′-phosphorylated 5-nucleotide gap 2.5-fold more readily than when the gap has a 5′-hydroxyl (i.e. amount of cross-linked complex in a 5′-phosphorylated gap/amount of cross-linked complex in a unphosphorylated gap). The loss of 5′-phosphate recognition results in equal cross-linked mutant complexes in the presence or absence of a 5′-phosphate in the gap. To quantify the cross-linked complexes, the autoradiogram was scanned on an Imager Master VDS, and the data were analyzed using ImageMaster software. Typically, wild-type 8-kDa domain or a mutant protein (50 μm) was mixed with [32P](dT)16 (14 μm) in a 15-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mm MgCl2. The samples were irradiated, and the photochemical cross-linked 8-kDa protein-[32P](dT)16 complexes were separated and analyzed as described (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To quantify cross-linking, the dried gels were scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were analyzed using ImageQuant software. A 49-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide containing uracil at position 21 was labeled at the 3′-end by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase using [α-32P]ddATP as described (12Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled uracil containing duplex DNA (62.5 nm) was pretreated with 10 nm UDG in 100 μl of buffer containing 70 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C. After a 20-min incubation, the reaction mixture was supplemented with 5 mmMgCl2 and 10 nm AP endonuclease, and the incubation was continued for another 20 min. dRP lyase activity was performed in a reaction mixture (10 μl) containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 nm preincised32P-labeled AP site containing DNA. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 nm wild-type 8-kDa domain or a mutant derivative and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. The reaction was terminated by transfer to 0–1 °C, and the DNA product was stabilized by addition of 2 m NaBH4 to a final concentration of 340 mm and incubation for 30 min on ice. The stabilized DNA products were recovered by ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml tRNA and resuspended in 10 μl of gel-loading buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.02% bromphenol blue, and 0.02% xylene cyanol). After incubation at 75 °C for 2 min, the reaction products were separated by electrophoresis in a 20% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 murea in 89 mm Tris-HCl, 89 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.8, and visualized by autoradiography. To quantify the product, gels were scanned on a PhosphorImager 450 (Molecular Dynamics), and the data were analyzed using ImageQuant software.

The residues and alterations selected for mutagenesis were based on the proposed role of each residue in DNA binding (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P.

Briefly, the primary structure of a portion of the HhH motif (residues 55–79) in the 8-kDa domain is similar to that of the HhH motif inE. coli endonuclease III glycosylase/AP lyase (17Pelletier H.

In addition, significant intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects and chemical shift changes were observed in the1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum correlation NMR spectra for surface-exposed residues upon addition of ssDNA (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), including residues Phe25, Lys60, Glu71, Lys72, and Glu75. Lys68 is adjacent to residues showing chemical shift changes. Lys84 is in the NMR unstructured linker region between the 8-kDa and 31-kDa domains but is coordinated with the 5′-phosphate in one of the crystal structures, along with Lys35, Lys60, and Lys72 (16Liu D.-J. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9537-9545Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 17Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In the NMR structure, the adjacent flexible Ω-loop residue Lys35 contributes to the basal surface charge potential and is adjacent to Lys72 and Lys68 (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Also in the Ω-loop, His34 has been shown to cross-link with ssDNA (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to stack with a template strand base in the crystal structure of β-pol bound to DNA (21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). The positions of the 9 residues selected for mutagenesis in the crystal structure of β-pol bound to one-nucleotide gapped DNA are illustrated in Fig. 1. Single mutations were constructed at residues Phe25, His34, Glu71, and Glu75 and at the lysines at positions 35, 60, 68, 72, and 84. His34 was changed to glycine, and Glu71 was changed to glutamine to remove the base-stacking potential and carboxylate moieties, respectively. Double mutants were constructed at Lys68 and Lys72(K68A/K72A) and Lys68 and Glu71 (K68A/E71Q), and a triple alanine mutant (K35A/K68A/K72A) was also examined. Each 8-kDa protein was expressed in E. coli, and the recombinant protein was found to be soluble in the crude cell extract. Following purification, SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the mutant 8-kDa polypeptides were greater than 95% homogeneous (data not shown). During chromatography and electrophoresis, the mutant proteins behaved similarly to the wild-type 8-kDa domain, suggesting that the alteration did not cause gross changes in the structural properties of the proteins. The CD spectra of single mutants K35A, K68A, K72A, K84A, E71Q, and E75A, the double mutant (K68A/K72A), and the triple mutant (K35A/K68A/K72A) of the 8-kDa domain were similar to the CD spectrum of the wild-type 8-kDa domain. The comparable maximal negative ellipticities at 208 and 220 nm indicated that the overall helical structure in the mutants was similar to that seen in wild-type 8-kDa domain (Fig. 2). The differences in the absolute molar ellipticity at 220 nm for the mutants relative to wild type are due to error inherent in the protein concentration determinations. Positive ellipticity in the K35A and K72A single mutants at 240–260 nm was due to the presence of a minor DNA contamination eluting from the ssDNA cellulose column during purification. This DNA contaminant, however, is not seen in the CD spectrum of the highly purified wild-type 8-kDa protein. There is an increase in the ratio of negative ellipticity at 222 nm to negative ellipticity at 208 nm in the K68A/K72A mutant in comparison with the relative ellipticities at these wavelengths observed with wild type (i.e. more negative ellipticity at 222 nm and less negative ellipticity at 208 nm in the double mutant). The increase in the ratio of the maximal negative ellipticity at 222 nm versus 208 nm in the double mutant suggests an increase in helical structure in comparison with the wild-type 8-kDa domain. Similar results for the K35A/K68A/K72A triple mutant were also observed. On the basis of these results, we conclude that the substitutions chosen at these surface-exposed residues do not adversely affect the overall structure of the 8-kDa domain and that the effects of the mutations on ssDNA binding, 5′-phosphate recognition in gapped DNA, and dRP lyase activity are likely the result of the loss of specific side chain functionality. The ssDNA binding activity of the 39-kDa enzyme has been demonstrated to reside in the 8-kDa domain (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ssDNA binding activities of the wild-type 8-kDa domain and mutant proteins were examined by an assay involving photochemical cross-linking to oligo(dT)16 as described previously (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To assay ssDNA binding activity, purified protein was mixed with [32P](dT)16 and irradiated with UV light to covalently cross-link the bound ligand. The cross-linked products were separated by SDS-PAGE and scored by autoradiography and PhosphorImager scanning (Fig. 3 and TableI). Under the conditions of the assay, the level of cross-linking is proportional to the equilibrium association constant, K a (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative analysis of the UV cross-linked products indicated that the single mutants K35A, K60A, K68A, and F25W, and the triple mutant K35A/K68A/K72A were reduced in ssDNA binding by approximately 60–75% compared with wild type (Fig. 3 and Table I). The other mutants had similar ssDNA binding as wild type. Alanine substitution for Lys35, Lys68, and Lys60 had the weakest binding. Interestingly, alanine substitution for Lys72 did not affect ssDNA binding activity. In the intact enzyme, Lys72has been shown to be a target for pyridoxal 5′-phosphate modification and was protected by dNTP binding (29Basu A. Kedar P. Wilson S.H. Modak M.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6305-6309Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Lys72 has also been implicated in forming a Schiff base intermediate with abasic site DNA (12Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The mutant bearing a glycine substitution for His34was slightly reduced (≈25%) in ssDNA binding activity. This histidine residue was found to be covalently UV cross-linked to ssDNA (22Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and in the crystal structure (Fig. 1), the imidazole ring was observed to stabilize the template base near the polymerase active site by stacking interactions (21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In contrast, alanine substitution for Lys68 reduced ssDNA binding activity by 70%. Surprisingly, a double alanine mutation at Lys68 and Lys72exhibited wild-type ssDNA binding activity, suggesting a compensating effect in the double mutant protein. The triple mutant, K35A/K68A/K72A, showed further reduction in ssDNA binding activity over that observed with the K68A/K72A double mutant (Fig. 3 and Table I). These results confirm the importance of Lys35 in ssDNA binding activity.Table ISummary of ssDNA binding, 5′-phosphate recognition, and dRP lyase activities of mutants of the 8-kDa domain of β-polMutantdRP lyase1-aActivity relative to wild-type: ++++, 75–100%; +++, 50–75%; ++, 25–50%; +, 1–25%; −, <1%; ND, not determined.

This DNA gap binding of β-pol was directed by the amino-terminal 8-kDa domain (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, the crystal structure of β-pol in complex with gapped DNA substrates suggests that the 5′-phosphate in the gap is coordinated either by four lysines of the 8-kDa domain (residues 35, 68, 72, and 84) (17Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), or Lys35 and Lys68 (21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), as illustrated in Fig. 1. These results were consistent with NMR studies showing protein-DNA interactions at or near these same lysine residues, among other residues (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To identify the residue(s) involved in 5′-phosphate recognition in gapped DNA, a synthetic gapped DNA substrate was formed by annealing two 17-residue oligonucleotides (designated P1and P2) to a 39-residue template (T) creating a 5-nucleotide gap between the 3′-hydroxyl of P1 and the 5′-phosphate or 5′-hydroxyl of P2 (see Fig. 4 B and “Experimental Procedures”). This DNA substrate was incubated with wild-type or mutant proteins of the 8-kDa domain, and the complex was then photochemically cross-linked with UV light (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To score the covalently cross-linked complexes, the 5′-end of the P1oligonucleotide was 32P-labeled. After cross-linking, the mixture was separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was analyzed by autoradiography (Fig. 4 A and Table I). The results show that cross-linking between the 8-kDa domain, template (T), and primer (P1) is strongly influenced by the phosphate group on the 5′-end of P2 as previously demonstrated (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the Lys35 alanine mutant showed a strong decline in 5′-phosphate recognition activity, alanine substitutions of Lys60, Lys68, or Lys72 retained the recognition activity (Fig. 4 A and Table I). The E75A mutant also displayed a diminished ability to discriminate between the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated gaps. The lower amount of cross-linking for the K60A and K68A mutants is consistent with the lower ssDNA binding activity of these mutants, but both mutants retained the 5′-phosphate recognition activity of wild type (Fig. 4 A and Table I). Both NMR and crystallography data suggested that Lys35 and Lys68 are sites for 5′-phosphate contact (15Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 17Pelletier H. Sawaya M.R. Wolfle W. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 12742-12761Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Our results on 5′-phosphate recognition with the K35A mutant support the conclusion that Lys35 coordinates the 5′-phosphate group, whereas Lys68 does not. The finding that Lys35 is a key residue in 5′-phosphate recognition is further supported from the results obtained with the triple mutant (K35A/K68A/K72A). The triple mutant failed to discriminate between phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of the gapped DNA ligand (lanes 14–15). Taken together, these results indicate that lysine residues 60, 68, and 35 are important for ssDNA binding, whereas Lys35 is critical for 5′-phosphate recognition. Lys84 and the exposed residues displaying significant NMR chemical shift changes upon binding (dT)8, such as Glu71, had little or no influence on the DNA binding activities tested when mutated to alanine or glutamine (Figs. 3and 4 and Table I). To examine the dRP lyase activity of wild-type and mutant enzymes, we utilized a 49-residue oligonucleotide duplex DNA, which contained a uracil residue at position 21. The uracil-containing strand was 3′-end labeled with [α-32P]ddAMP and annealed to its complementary DNA strand. To prepare DNA substrate for the dRP lyase reaction, the32P-labeled duplex DNA was pretreated with UDG and AP endonuclease. Thus, the resulting DNA substrate contains a 5′-dRP group and a 32P-labeled ddAMP residue at the 3′-end of the downstream DNA strand (Fig. 5 B). Wild-type and mutant enzymes were incubated with this pretreated 32P-labeled duplex DNA, and at the end of each reaction period the DNA product was stabilized by NaBH4. The release of 5′-dRP from the32P-labeled substrate was determined by the appearance of a new radioactive electrophoretic band migrating approximately one-half nucleotide faster than the substrate (Fig. 5 A). Results of dRP lyase activity of alanine substitutions are shown (Fig. 5 A), but the results of all the mutants have been summarized (Fig. 5 C and Table I). Our results indicate that Lys68 retained wild-type dRP lyase activity when mutated to alanine. We had previously considered that this residue was a candidate nucleophile involved in Schiff base formation during the lyase reaction, based on sequence alignment with endonuclease III (28Mullen G.P. Antuch W. Maciejewski M.W. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 35: 12057-12066Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the corresponding lysine (residue 120) in the HhH motif of endonuclease III strongly reduced AP site lyase activity (20Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). In contrast, our results indicate that Lys68 is not a candidate for Schiff base formation in the dRP lyase reaction catalyzed by the 8-kDa domain of β-pol. While mutants E75A, K35A, H34G, and K60A retained approximately 40–75% dRP lyase activity, the K72A had less than 10% activity of wild type (Fig. 5 C). There was no further decline in dRP lyase activity with the K68A/K72A double mutant over that of the K72A single mutant, suggesting that a Schiff base nucleophile role for Lys68 in the K72A mutant is unlikely. Near wild-type dRP lyase activity was observed for F25W, K84A, E71Q, and the K68A/E71Q double mutant. The triple mutant, K35A/K68A/K72A, was essentially devoid of dRP lyase activity (<1%), and use of a 10-fold higher protein concentration also failed to reveal detectable activity (data not shown). Our data suggest that Lys72 is the best candidate as the Schiff base-forming nucleophile. This interpretation must be considered in light of the results obtained by Piersen et al. (12Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), who demonstrated that a Schiff base intermediate could be formed with the K72A mutant of intact β-pol, albeit at a strongly reduced efficiency. Reduction in the dRP lyase activity of the alanine mutant of Lys60 may be attributed to a significant loss in ssDNA binding. A role of His34 in β-elimination chemistry has also been proposed, and the loss in dRP lyase activity of the H34G mutant is consistent with a role for this residue in lyase chemistry, as suggested previously (28Mullen G.P. Antuch W. Maciejewski M.W. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 35: 12057-12066Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The activities characterized for each 8-kDa domain mutant are summarized in Table I. Although Lys72 is the candidate for Schiff base formation during the dRP lyase reaction, the K72A mutant retained significant residual activity. Thus, Lys72 may be the preferred, but not obligatory, Schiff base nucleophile. The residual activity with K72A may be contributed from an alternate Schiff base nucleophile in the lysine-rich pocket formed in the wild type by Lys35, Lys68, Lys72, and Lys84 (21Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). In the absence of Lys72, partial deprotonation at a nearby amine, such as Lys35, could activate this amine and allow it to function as a backup Schiff base nucleophile. This explanation is strengthened by the observation of complete loss of dRP lyase activity in the triple mutant where lysines 35, 68, and 72 are changed to alanine. Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that Lys72 and Lys35 are involved in the dRP lyase reaction catalyzed by the 8-kDa domain and that Lys35 is involved in 5′-phosphate recognition. Lys35 may stabilize the leaving group in the dRP lyase reaction through its interaction with the 5′-phosphate of the DNA terminus, and Lys35 could be activated in this role by His34. In conclusion, it is interesting to compare the results of our site-directed mutagenesis with NMR and x-ray crystallography studies of the 8-kDa domain. Alanine substitution for lysine at residues 35, 60, and 72 resulted in loss of function for 5′-phosphate recognition, DNA binding, and dRP lyase, respectively. In each case, this loss of function was perfectly consistent with the structural data,e.g. Fig. 1. Similarly, Lys84 and Glu71 are distal to the dRP lyase active site and also to the DNA binding interface, and the K84A and E71Q mutants are not altered in any of the activities tested. The H34G mutant shows loss of a portion of the dRP lyase activity, and this is consistent with predictions from NMR studies (27Prasad R. Beard W.A. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18096-18101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the E75A mutant has lower 5′-phosphate recognition, and this is not suggested by the structural data. The results with Lys68 are surprising. The K68A mutant, as with K35A and K60A, is lower in DNA binding activity. However, K68A is not lower in either 5′-phosphate recognition or dRP lyase activity, as expected."

Neurotransmitter release represents a specialized form of regulated secretion wherein neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles selectively dock and fuse with the plasma membrane. This process constitutes an essential step in chemical synaptic transmission and is a likely target for regulatory reactions that modulate the strength of synaptic signaling. The identification and biochemical characterization of numerous synaptic vesicle and presynaptic plasma membrane proteins have provided fundamental insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying neurotransmitter release (for reviews see Refs 1Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 63-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholarand 2Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Among the important findings that have emerged from molecular studies of neurotransmitter release is the central role of a protein complex composed of two presynaptic plasma membrane proteins, syntaxin 1 andsynaptosome-associatedprotein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25), 1The abbreviations used are: SNAP-25, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa; VAMP2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2; NSF, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; TPCK,l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone; AEBSF, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonyl fluoride; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; DTT, dithiothreitol; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase HPLC. along with one synaptic vesicle protein, vesicle-associatedmembrane protein 2 (VAMP2; also known as synaptobrevin). Several lines of evidence suggest a primary role for syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. First, each represents a substrate for cleavage by distinct clostridial neurotoxins, toxins that irreversibly inhibit neurotransmitter releasein vivo (3Schiavo G. Rossetto O. Montecucco C. Semin. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 4Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, genetic studies inDrosophila have shown that loss of syntaxin 1 or VAMP2 prevents Ca2+-dependent exocytosis (5Broadie K. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. O'Kane C.J. Schulze K.L. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 1995; 15: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Finally, the ternary complex formed by all three proteins acts as a receptor for soluble N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF)attachment proteins (SNAPs), cytosolic proteins required in multiple membrane trafficking events (6Söllner T.

Consequently, the syntaxin 1·SNAP-25·VAMP2 ternary complex is commonly referred to as the synaptic SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex, and its individual components are generically termed SNARE proteins. Recent biochemical studies have shown that syntaxin 1, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 interact directly to form both binary and ternary complexes (7Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. Scheller R.H.

The ternary complex is noteworthy because of its unusual stability, as judged by resistance to dissociation in the presence of the denaturing detergent SDS (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence support the potential biological relevance of the SDS-resistant state. First, temperature-sensitive SDS-resistant complexes are present in brain homogenate directly solubilized with SDS (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). In addition, the SDS-resistant SNARE complex is a bona fide receptor for α-SNAP and NSF (13Pellegrini L.L. O'Conner V. Lottspeich F. Betz H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4705-4713Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Finally, ternary SNARE complex assembly is unaffected by clostridial neurotoxin cleavage of individual SNAREs, yet SDS-resistance is compromised (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that SDS-resistant ternary complexes may exist in vivo and could be required for neurotransmitter release at the nerve terminal.In vitro binding studies utilizing deletion mutants of syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 have demonstrated that the following critical regions are required for binary and ternary SNARE complex formation (7Calakos N.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4317-4326Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar): (i) a carboxyl-terminal, membrane-proximal region of syntaxin 1A (sufficient for both binary and ternary interactions with VAMP2 and SNAP-25); (ii) the cytoplasmic domain of VAMP2 (sufficient for both binary and ternary interactions with syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25); (iii) an amino-terminal region of SNAP-25 (sufficient for binary interaction with syntaxin 1A and for ternary complex assembly); and (iv) a carboxyl-terminal region of SNAP-25 (required in conjunction with the amino-terminal region of SNAP-25 for interaction with VAMP2 and stabilization of the ternary complex). Interestingly, within these critical regions are multiple heptad repeat domains that are predicted to form an α-helical coiled coil (15Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3483) Google Scholar), a protein interaction motif that can generate a variety of stable structures (16Lupas A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 375-382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar). This suggests that a coiled-coil structure may contribute to the assembly and stability of SNARE complexes. Although the domains of syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP2 necessary and sufficient for pairwise and ternary interactions have been well characterized in recent years, the minimal interacting regions within binary and ternary complexes have not been defined. Even less is known regarding the role of syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 carboxyl-terminal transmembrane domains in SNARE complex assembly. In the present study, we have utilized limited proteolysis of binary and ternary synaptic SNARE complexes to (i) identify the minimal interacting regions within binary and ternary complexes, (ii) demonstrate that these minimal regions are sufficient for assembly of stable, SDS-resistant ternary complexes, and (iii) characterize the role of the carboxyl-terminal transmembrane anchors of syntaxin 1A and VAMP2 in SNARE complex assembly and stability. The results presented provide further insight into synaptic SNARE complex structure. A mouse monoclonal antibody against rat VAMP2 was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). A rabbit polyclonal antibody against a carboxyl-terminal mouse SNAP-25 peptide (amino acids 195–206) was acquired from StressGen Biotechnologies (Victoria, British Columbia, Canada). Rabbit polyclonal antisera against rat syntaxin 1A, rat VAMP2 cytoplasmic domain, and mouse SNAP-25 were generated, and HPC-1 (anti-syntaxin 1A) ascites fluid was supplied by Berkeley Antibody (Richmond, CA). Molecular biology reagents were purchased from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA), New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and Boehringer Mannheim. Bovine serum albumin, human thrombin, glutathione-agarose, TPCK-treated bovine pancreas trypsin, and reagent grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma. 4-(2-Aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (AEBSF) was purchased from ICN Biochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose and M15[pREP4] cells were obtained from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Two vector systems were used for expression of recombinant fusion proteins in Escherichia coli. The pGEX-KG vector (17Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1641) Google Scholar), a derivative of the pGEX-2T vector (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), allows for expression of recombinant proteins fused with glutathione S-transferase (GST) at the amino terminus. The pQE-30 vector (Qiagen) allows for expression of recombinant proteins with an amino-terminal 6-histidine tag (His6). Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins of full-length rat syntaxin 1A (amino acids 4–288), syntaxin 1A cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 4–266), syntaxin 1A carboxyl-terminal membrane proximal fragment (amino acids 191–266; syntaxin 1A-16), full-length mouse SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206), rat VAMP2 cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 1–94), and a VAMP2 cytoplasmic domain internal deletion mutant (amino acids 1–94, Δ41–50) were previously described (7Calakos N.

A plasmid encoding a GST-SNAP-25 amino-terminal fusion protein (amino acids 1–95) was prepared by digesting the full-length clone withHindIII (which cuts both in the SNAP-25 insert and at the 3′-end of the pGEX-KG polylinker), followed by religation. Plasmids encoding GST-SNAP-25 (carboxyl terminus; amino acids 125–206), GST-VAMP2 (full-length; amino acids 1–116), His6-SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206), and His6-syntaxin 1A-16 were prepared by insertion of the appropriate polymerase chain reaction-amplified or cDNA fragment into pGEX-KG (EcoRI and NcoI sites for SNAP-25 carboxyl terminus; EcoRI site for full-length VAMP2) or pQE30 (BamHI site for SNAP-25;BamHI and PstI sites for syntaxin 1A-16). GST fusion proteins were expressed in the AB1899 strain of E. coli and purified as described previously (19Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) 0.2 mm AEBSF and 1 mm DTT were included in the cell lysis buffer; (ii) GST-VAMP2 (amino acids 1–116) and GST-syntaxin 1A proteins were prepared from bacterial cultures grown to an A 600 = 0.6 and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 2 h at 30 °C; (iii) following cell lysis of GST-VAMP2 (amino acids 1–116) and GST-syntaxin 1A bacterial cultures, n-lauroyl sarcosine and Triton X-100 were each added to a final concentration of 1%, and the lysates were incubated at 4 °C for 30 min prior to centrifugation; (iv) during glutathione-agarose affinity chromatography, 10 mm methionine was included in the PBST (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST-Met)) and in the thrombin cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2), and 1 mm DTT was used in the thrombin cleavage buffer in place of β-mercaptoethanol; and (v) for purification of proteins retaining the transmembrane domains (VAMP2 (amino acids 1–116) and syntaxin 1A (amino acids 4–288)), all buffers were supplemented with 0.5% Triton X-100. His6 fusion protein expression in E. coli strain M15[pREP4] (His6-SNAP-25) or AB1899 (His6-syntaxin 1A-16) was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside atA 600 = 1.0 (His6-SNAP-25) or atA 600 = 0.6 (His6-syntaxin 1A-16). The bacterial lysate for His6-SNAP-25 was prepared as described previously (19Bennett M.K. Miller K.G. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while the lysate for His6-syntaxin 1A-16 was prepared as described above. His6 fusion proteins were purified by incubation with nickel-NTA-agarose in nickel binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 50 mmimidazole, 10 mm methionine, and 1 mm DTT) at 4 °C for 1 h. Fusion proteins were eluted from the nickel-NTA resin with nickel elution buffer (nickel binding buffer supplemented with 250 mm imidazole). Protein concentrations were estimated using BCA reagent (Pierce) or by Coomassie Blue staining of protein bands after SDS-PAGE with bovine serum albumin as a standard for both assays. Combinations of purified recombinant proteins (5 μm each) in thrombin cleavage buffer supplemented with 10 mm methionine and 1 mm DTT were incubated overnight at 4 °C and divided into three or four aliquots, depending on the number of trypsin conditions to be analyzed. TPCK-treated trypsin in PBST was added to achieve a trypsin:total protein ratio of 1:500, 1:200, 1:50, or 1:25. Digests were carried out for 1 h at room temperature and stopped by the addition of AEBSF. Samples were incubated with nickel beads (in the presence of 1 mm DTT) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with PBST-Met, and bound proteins/protein complexes were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Protein fragments remaining in the supernatant (lacking the His6 tag) were isolated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. The samples were either boiled or heated at 37 °C, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining or Western blotting. Trypsin-digested SNARE complexes were eluted from nickel-NTA-agarose resin with PBST-Met supplemented with 1 mm DTT and 300 mmimidazole. To resolve the protected fragments, samples were subjected to RP-HPLC. Binary complex (1:200 trypsin condition) and ternary complex (1:25 trypsin condition) samples were separated on a C4 column (2.1-mm diameter; VYDAC, Hesperia, CA) with a flow rate of 175 μl/min. After a 10-min wash at 5% B, the samples were eluted with a gradient from 5 to 95% B over 90 min. Buffer A contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 0.2% acetonitrile/H2O, and buffer B contained 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile. Eluted protein fragments were detected by monitoring A 220 andA 280. Fractions were dried and analyzed either by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting or by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (Hewlet Packard 5989A) and amino-terminal sequencing. Anti-syntaxin 1 monoclonal antibody (HPC-1; 300 μg of Ig) was bound to protein G-Sepharose beads (0.5 ml) and cross-linked with 20 mm dimethylpimelimidate. The antibody beads (0.2 ml) were then mixed with either Triton X-100 solubilized rat brain membranes (LP1; 12 mg of total protein) or recombinant ternary complex (55–60 μg of total protein) for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with PBST containing 0.5% Triton X-100, and syntaxin 1-containing complexes were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.0, containing 0.5% Triton X-100. The eluate was neutralized with 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the protein concentration was determined. The immunoprecipitated complexes were subjected to trypsin digestion (1:200 trypsin:total protein) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. To test the heat lability of SDS-resistant SNARE complexes, trypsin-digested samples (1:200 trypsin condition) were divided into 11 aliquots and incubated at 50–100 °C in 5 °C increments for 3 min using a programmable thermal cycler (MJ Research, Watertown, MA). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting using a rabbit anti-syntaxin 1A antibody. SDS-PAGE was performed by the method of Laemmli (20Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Western blots were probed with one of the following antibodies: mouse anti-syntaxin 1A (1:5000, HPC-1) (Berkeley Antibody), rabbit anti-syntaxin 1A (1:1000), rabbit anti-SNAP-25 (SNAP-25(N)) (1:50,000), rabbit anti-SNAP-25 (195-206) (SNAP-25(C)) (1:4000) (StressGen Biotechnologies), mouse anti-VAMP2 (1:4000) (Chemicon International), and rabbit anti-VAMP2 (1:1000). The blots were processed with a chemiluminescence detection system (Renaissance enhanced luminol reagent (NEN Life Science Products)).

Neuron. 1994; 13: 353-361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the minimal interacting regions required for assembly of binary and ternary SNARE complexes include heptad repeat domains present in syntaxin 1A (H3), VAMP2 (H1 and H2), and SNAP-25 (H1, H2, and H3; Fig. 1). In this study, we have used limited proteolysis to further delineate the regions required for complex formation. Before analyzing the protease sensitivity of SNARE complexes, we determined whether the individual SNARE proteins have intrinsic resistance to trypsin. His6-syntaxin 1A-16 (amino acids 191–266), His6-SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206), and VAMP2 (amino acids 1–94) were treated with increasing concentrations of trypsin. Digested fragments retaining a His6 tag were isolated via nickel affinity chromatography (Fig. 2 A), and those lacking a His6 tag were isolated by precipitation of the nickel bead supernatant with trichloroacetic acid (Fig. 2 B). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies recognizing (i) syntaxin 1A; (ii) the carboxyl-terminal 12 amino acids of SNAP-25; (iii) the amino-terminal region of SNAP-25; and (iv) VAMP2. Each of the individual proteins was digested at low trypsin concentrations (Fig. 2, A and B), although an amino-terminal fragment of SNAP-25 was partially protected (Fig. 2 B). This amino-terminal SNAP-25 fragment is distinct from those protected in either binary or ternary SNARE complexes (see below), and its resistance to proteolysis may be the consequence of recombinant protein aggregation. The protease sensitivity of complexes containing His6-syntaxin 1A-16 was analyzed by treating preformed complexes with increasing concentrations of trypsin. The complexes were isolated by nickel affinity chromatography and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The total protein pattern was visualized by Coomassie staining, and individual proteins were identified by Western blotting. Treatment of a His6-syntaxin 1A-16·SNAP-25 binary complex with low concentrations of trypsin (1:500 and 1:200) resulted in the protection of a single fragment derived from syntaxin 1A and separate amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments of SNAP-25 (Fig. 3 A). In contrast, binary complexes generated with VAMP2 and either syntaxin 1A or SNAP-25 were not resistant to trypsin digestion (data not shown). Treatment of the His6-syntaxin 1A-16·SNAP-25·VAMP2 ternary complex with trypsin resulted in a pattern of syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25 protection similar to that observed for the binary complex (Fig. 3 B). However, protection was maintained even at the highest trypsin concentration (1:50), and the syntaxin 1A-16 and SNAP-25 carboxyl-terminal fragments each displayed a lower electrophoretic mobility relative to the binary complex protected fragments. Furthermore, VAMP2 was largely protected from proteolysis when assembled in a ternary complex (Fig. 3 B). These results demonstrate that the His6-syntaxin 1A-16·SNAP-25 binary complex is partially resistant to proteolysis, and this resistance is further increased following the addition of VAMP2 to form the ternary SNARE complex. To more precisely define the protected regions of each protein, the protease-resistant fragments generated by trypsin digestion were analyzed by RP-HPLC, amino-terminal sequencing, and mass spectrometry. A ternary complex not exposed to trypsin (PBST control) was also analyzed in order to distinguish between trypsin proteolysis and potential proteolysis during expression and purification of the recombinant proteins (see Table I). Separation of the trypsin-digested ternary complex by RP-HPLC yielded four sets of peaks (Fig. 4 A). SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis demonstrated that each peak consisted of a single prominent species (Fig. 4 B) corresponding to one of the protected core fragments (Fig. 4 C). Amino-terminal sequence and mass spectrometry analyses were carried out to further define the amino- and carboxyl-terminal boundaries of the protected fragments and to deduce the nearest internal protected trypsin sites (Table I). As summarized in Fig. 5, the protected fragments ranged in size from 70 to 94 amino acids and included, but were not limited to, all of the heptad repeat domains within the SNARE proteins analyzed. To determine whether trypsin protection extends beyond the amino-terminal boundary of syntaxin 1A-16, we examined the syntaxin 1A fragment generated following trypsin treatment of a ternary SNARE complex incorporating syntaxin 1A cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 4–266). The protected syntaxin 1A fragment included the 22 amino acids preceding the start of syntaxin 1A-16 but did not include either of the first two heptad repeat domains of syntaxin 1A (Fig. 5).Table IMass spectrometry and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of binary and ternary SNARE complexesProteinSyntaxin 1A-16 · SNAP-25 · VAMP2 ternary complexSyntaxin 1A-16 · SNAP-25 binary complexPBST controlTrypsin-resistant fragmentsNearest internal trypsin sitesTrypsin-resistant fragmentsNearest internal trypsin sitesAmino-terminalCarboxyl-terminalAmino-terminalCarboxyl-terminalSyntaxin 1A-16 (amino acids 191–266)191–2661-aMajor component.191–260198256191–2601-aMajor component.198256191–260199–247214246SNAP-25 (amino acids 1–206) Amino-terminal1–2061-aMajor component.1–948831–831-aMajor component.8751–19817 –?17 Carboxyl-terminal125–206135201136 –?136–2061-aMajor component.136201137–206142201VAMP2 (amino acids 1–94)1–911–911-aMajor component.3087NA1-bNA, not applicable.NANA1–8630851-a Major component.1-1002 NA, not applicable.

However, the binary complex protected fragments displayed greater amino- and carboxyl-terminal heterogeneity. These observations further suggest that the structure of the ternary complex is more stable and compact than that of the syntaxin 1A-16·SNAP-25 binary complex. One of the unique properties of both native and recombinant ternary SNARE complexes is their resistance to denaturation in SDS (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C.

We have analyzed the effect of trypsin treatment on the temperature sensitivity and multimerization of SDS-resistant ternary complexes. To carry out these analyses, control and trypsin-treated (1:50) samples were incubated at increasing temperatures in SDS-PAGE sample buffer prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of trypsin, anti-syntaxin 1A Western blotting revealed three prominent SDS-resistant complexes (with apparent molecular masses of 50, 100, and 200 kDa), all of which were dissociated at >70 °C (Fig. 6 A). The 50-kDa complex corresponds to a heterotrimer (composed of syntaxin 1A, SNAP-25, and VAMP2), while the higher molecular weight complexes represent SDS-resistant multimers of this heterotrimer (9Hayashi T.

The ability of sentrin-2 to conjugate to other proteins was tested by expressing hemagglutinin epitope-tagged sentrin-2 in COS cells. Western blot analysis showed that sentrin-2 could be transferred to other proteins in a pattern similar to that of sentrin-1 conjugation and had similar C-terminal processing. We further showed that both sentrin-1 and sentrin-2 could covalently modify RanGAP1, a Ran GTPase-activating protein critically involved in nuclear transport. Immunocytochemical analysis showed that sentrin-2 derivatives were highly enriched in the nucleus.

Analysis of the amino acid sequence of sentrin revealed a ubiquitin-like domain (residues 22–97), which is 18% identical and 48% homologous to human ubiquitin. In contrast to ubiquitin, sentrin contains 21 additional amino acids at the N terminus and 4 more amino acids at the C terminus (see Fig. 1). Using a COS cell expression system, we showed that the C terminus of sentrin is efficiently processed to allow sentrin to conjugate to other proteins via the conserved Gly-97 residue (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, the conjugation patterns between hemagglutinin (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; UCRP, ubiquitin cross-reactive protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody. epitope-tagged sentrin versus ubiquitin are entirely distinct (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Furthermore, most of the sentrinized proteins appear to be localized in the nucleus, in contrast to the uniform expression of ubiquitin in both the nuclear and cytosolic compartments (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Using sentrin as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified Ubc9 as a preferred conjugating enzyme for the sentrinization pathway (3Gong L. Kamitani T. Fujise K. Caskey L. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28198-28201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar).In vitro translated sentrin could be precipitated by a glutathione S-transferase-Ubc9 fusion protein, but not by glutathione S-transferase. A β-mercaptoethanol-sensitive Ubc9-sentrin conjugate could also be identified in the in vitro binding assay. Substitution of the conserved Cys residue of Ubc9 by Ser abolished the formation of the Ubc9-sentrin conjugate. Thus, sentrin was able to form a thiol ester linkage with Ubc9 via the conserved Cys-93 residue. Recently, two other laboratories independently identified a novel ubiquitin-like protein called SUMO-1 or GMP-1 that could covalently modify RanGAP1, a Ran GTPase-activating protein critically involved in nuclear transport (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the amino acid sequences of SUMO-1 and GMP-1 are identical to that of sentrin (1Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). RanGAP1 exists as a 70-kDa monomer in the cytosol and is converted to a 90-kDa protein following sentrin modification. Thus, sentrinization of RanGAP1 is essential for the translocation of RanGAP1 from the cytosol to the nuclear pore complex to participate in nuclear protein import (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Taken together, sentrinization is a unique pathway for protein modification that is distinct from ubiquitination. Data base research revealed the presence of sentrin homologues inSaccharomyces cerevisiae (GenBank™ accession number U27233; 50% identity and 74% similarity), Caenorhabditis elegans(X99600; 66% identity and 83% similarity), Arabidopsis thaliana (X99609; 49% identity and 64% similarity), andOryza sativa (X99608; 48% identity and 66% similarity). The presence of sentrin homologues from A. thaliana toHomo sapiens suggests that sentrin is an evolutionary conserved protein that may have a specialized function in cellular metabolism. The yeast homologue of sentrin is termed Smt3, which is a high copy suppressor of the conditional lethal mif2mutation, which, at nonpermissive temperature, shows increased mitotic chromosome instability, sensitivity to anti-microtubule drugs, and formation of aberrant spindles that break in half during anaphase (6Meluh P.B. Koshland D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 793-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar,7Brown M.T. Goetsch L. Hartwell L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 387-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have preliminary results demonstrating that human sentrin could also suppress the yeast mif2mutation, 2L. Gong, L. Caskey, and E. T. H. Yeh, unpublished results. suggesting that human sentrin and yeast Smt3 are involved in a evolutionary conserved pathway of protein modification. Further analysis of the data base, however, revealed two additional human cDNA sequences (X99584 andX99585) that are highly homologous to sentrin. This is of interest because there is only one sentrin homologue reported for all of the nonmammalian genera and species. It is not known whether any of these human cDNAs could encode functional proteins that also participate in the sentrinization pathway. In this report, we analyze a second member of the sentrin family, demonstrating the remarkably conserved modification patterns between these two sentrins. COS-M6 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 12CA5 (Boehringer Mannheim) and 16B12 (BAbCo, Richmond, CA) are mouse monoclonal antibodies to the peptide sequence YPYDVPDYA of influenza HA. Mouse anti-RH (specific for the amino acid sequence RGSHHHH) monoclonal antibody was purchased from QIAGEN Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). Rabbit anti-RanGAP1 antiserum was kindly provided by Frauke Melchior (The Scripps Research Institute). To express HA-tagged proteins in COS-M6 cells, two vectors for amino-terminal tagging (pcDNA3/HA-N) and carboxyl-terminal tagging (pcDNA3/HA-C) were constructed as described previously (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HA adaptor duplexes were inserted into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and then the cDNAs of ubiquitin, sentrin-1, Rad51, and sentrin-2 mutants were isolated by polymerase chain reaction using appropriate primers, followed by ligation into pcDNA3/HA-N or pcDNA3/HA-C. To express RGS(H)6-tagged RanGAP1 (RH-RanGAP1) in COS-M6 cells, the amino-terminal tagging vector (pcDNA3/RH-N) was constructed in the same way as pcDNA3/HA-N. The cDNA of RanGAP1 was isolated by polymerase chain reaction from a cDNA library of human testis and inserted into pcDNA3/RH-N to make pcDNA3/RH-RanGAP1. The sequence of each insert was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. Plasmids were transfected into COS-M6 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). The transfected cells were harvested for Western blotting or immunostaining 16 h after transfection. A full-length cDNA fragment of human sentrin-1 or sentrin-2 from plasmid pcDNA3/sentrin-1-HA or pcDNA3/sentrin-2-HA, respectively, was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP with a Megaprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The radioactive probe was hybridized with human multiple tissue Northern blots purchased fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Cells (1 × 106) were harvested, washed twice with cold PBS, and centrifuged. To prevent protein degradation, the cell pellet was immediately transferred into liquid nitrogen, and then the frozen pellet was treated at 45 °C for 1 h in 300 μl of 2% SDS treating solution containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol. DNA in the sample was sheared with a 25-gauge needle. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, using 3 μl of the sample (equivalent to 1 × 104 cells) per lane, Western blotting was performed following the protocol of the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). As a secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used. To investigate the conjugation of sentrin-2 to RanGAP1, RH-RanGAP1 was coexpressed with HA-Rad51 (negative control), HA-ubiquitin, HA-sentrin-1 (positive control), or HA-sentrin-2 in COS-M6 cells by the cotransfection method. Since the sequence of the RH tag is RGSHHHHHH, RH-RanGAP1 can be purified by nickel-charged beads (8Kamitani T. Katsumi K. Nguyen R. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The total cell lysate of the transfectants expressing RH-RanGAP1 and HA-tagged protein was prepared in lysis buffer (6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 500 mm sodium chloride (pH 7.8)). DNA in the sample was sheared with a 22-gauge needle, and then the lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 15 °C. The supernatant was incubated with nickel-charged agarose resin beads (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed twice with washing buffer (8 m urea, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 500 mm sodium chloride) (pH 7.8), followed by washing twice with washing buffer (pH 6.0). Finally, the beads were washed twice with PBS and treated in 2% SDS treating solution for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The solubilized proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibody (16B12) to detect RH-RanGAP1 conjugated to HA-tagged proteins and also using anti-RH antibody to detect every derivative of RH-RanGAP1. Immunohistochemical staining was performed by the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex method (9Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using the VECTASTAIN ABC kit system (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Transfected COS-M6 cells on coverslips were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde solution for 20 min and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, the fixed cells were incubated with PBS containing 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and then washed with PBS. The cells were incubated for 10 min with PBS containing 5% horse serum for blocking, followed by further incubation with anti-HA antibody (16B12) for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PBS, the cells were incubated with biotinylated anti-mouse IgG for 30 min at 37 °C, washed with PBS, and then treated with the avidin-biotin-horseradish peroxidase complex for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, the enzymatic disclosing procedure was performed as reported previously (9Kamitani T. Suzuki H. Yano S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1991; 58: 217-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Sentrin is a 101-amino acid polypeptide that is 18% identical and 48% homologous to ubiquitin (1Okura T. Gong L. Kamitani T. Wada T. Okura I. Wei C.F. Chang H.M. Yeh E.T.H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4277-4281PubMed Google Scholar). A data base search revealed two human cDNA sequences (GenBank™ accession numbersX99584 and X99585) that are more closely related to sentrin than to ubiquitin. One of these sequences (X99585) encodes a 95-amino acid polypeptide that is 46% identical and 66% similar to sentrin. An identical polypeptide sequence is also encoded in a gene insertion in the p125 region of a cytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus genome (U89439). Because this novel polypeptide shares several biochemical characteristics with sentrin (see below), we have renamed the original sentrin as sentrin-1 and the new protein as sentrin-2. Sentrin-1 was named UBL1 (10Shen Z. Pardington-Purtymun P.E. Comeaux J.C. Moyzis R.K. Chen D.J. Genomics. 1996; 36: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), PIC-1 (11Boddy M.N. Howe K. Etkin L.D. Solomon E. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 971-982PubMed Google Scholar), GMP-1 (5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar), SUMO-1 (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar), and SMT3C (12Lapenta V. Chiurazzi P. van der Spek P. Pizzuti A. Hanaoka F. Brahe C. Genomics. 1997; 40: 362-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) by other laboratories. Sentrin-2 was named SMT3B or GMP-related protein in these reports. Fig. 1 shows the amino acid alignment of human sentrin-1, sentrin-2, and ubiquitin. As shown, sentrin-2 contains a ubiquitin domain, an N-terminal extension, and the conserved Gly-Gly residues in the C terminus. The amino acids proximal to the C-terminal Gly-Gly residues are QEQT or QQQT for sentrin-1 or sentrin-2, respectively, in contrast to LRLR in the ubiquitin molecule. Furthermore, the amino acid residue equivalent to Lys-48 in ubiquitin has been substituted with Gln in both sentrin-1 and sentrin-2. To determine the expression of sentrin-2 in human tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed using 32P-labeled human sentrin-1 or sentrin-2 cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 2, the pattern of expression is quite similar for both sentrin-1 and sentrin-2, with a wide range of messenger levels across all the tissues examined and notably lower in the placenta, lung, liver, kidney, and pancreas. Because sentrin-2 is highly homologous to sentrin-1, we sought to determine whether sentrin-2 could also be conjugated to other proteins in a manner analogous to sentrin-1. For this purpose, HA epitope-tagged sentrin-2 was expressed in COS cells as described previously (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged sentrin-1 or ubiquitin was used as a control, and total cell lysates prepared from transfected COS cells were analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3, both sentrin-1 and sentrin-2 monomers were clearly identified. In addition, sentrin-2 forms a number of conjugates similar to those of sentrin-1. Two anti-HA monoclonal antibodies were used in Western blot analyses. 12CA5 was more sensitive than 16B12 and could detect a 35-kDa band in both the sentrin-1- and sentrin-2-transfected lanes. The expression of the sentrin-2 monomer and conjugated proteins is always more prominent than the expression of sentrin-1. However, the conjugation patterns of sentrin-1 and sentrin-2 are similar, suggesting that they could modify common target proteins (see below). The C terminus of sentrin-2 contains 2 amino acids, Val-94 and Tyr-95, distal to the conserved Gly-92 and Gly-93 residues. For sentrin-2 conjugation to occur, this C-terminal tail must be cleaved. As shown in Fig. 4, when the HA tag was placed at the C terminus of sentrin-2, it was efficiently cleaved in transfected COS cells (lane 7). Substitution of Ala for Gly-93 rendered the C terminus of the sentrin-2 monomer more resistant to processing (lanes 5 and 8). Thus, only p90 was observed inlane 5. Similar observations have been made with the processing of the C terminus of sentrin-1 (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Deletion of the C-terminal Gly-Val-Tyr residues (positions 93–95) of sentrin-2 abolished the conjugation activity of sentrin-2 (lane 3). Thus, the processing of the C terminus of sentrin-2 is identical to that of sentrin-1. However, it is not known whether the same enzyme is involved. As shown in Figs. 3 and4, the conjugation patterns of sentrin-1 and sentrin-2 are similar. Furthermore, a prominent 90-kDa band was observed in both sentrin-1- and sentrin-2-transfected samples. Since sentrin-1 has been shown to conjugate to RanGAP1 to form a 90-kDa protein (4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F. Cell. 1997; 88: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 5Matunis M.J. Coutavas E. Blobel G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1457-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar, 8Kamitani T. Katsumi K. Nguyen R. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether sentrin-2 could also be conjugated to RanGAP1. To test this hypothesis, the N terminus of RanGAP1 was tagged with the amino acid sequence RGSHHHHHH, termed RH tag, which allows for facile purification of the RanGAP1 fusion protein with nickel resin beads. Plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged sentrin-1, sentrin-2, ubiquitin, and Rad51 were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding RH-RanGAP1 into COS cells as described above. Total cell lysates prepared from the transfectants were precipitated first with nickel resin beads, followed by extensive washing. The precipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A (lanes 1–4), RanGAP1 could be modified by either sentrin-1 or sentrin-2, but not by ubiquitin or Rad51. The purified RH-RanGAP1 derivatives were detected in a separate Western blot analysis utilizing anti-RH monoclonal antibody. As shown in lanes 5–8, both unmodified RanGAP1 and sentrinized RanGAP1 could be observed equally in all samples. It should be noted that p90 in lanes 5 and6 was derived from RanGAP1 modified by native sentrin in COS cells. This was further supported by the observation of a doublet observed near p90 in the HA-sentrin-1- and HA-sentrin-2-transfected samples (lanes 7 and 8). The upper band is most likely HA-sentrin-modified RanGAP1, and thelower band is most likely native sentrin-modified RanGAP1 (lanes 7 and 8). In Fig. 5 B, we show that sentrin-1 or sentrin-2 mutants (sentrin G) in which the second conserved Gly residue was removed could not form any conjugate, including p90. These mutants were used to further prove that the formation of p90 requires a covalent linkage between RanGAP1 and either sentrin-1 or sentrin-2. Plasmids encoding HA epitope-tagged deletion mutants were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding RH-RanGAP1 into COS cells, and the lysates were prepared as described above. As shown in Fig. 5 C, the formation of sentrin and RanGAP1 conjugates requires the presence of the conserved Gly residue in the C terminus of the sentrin molecule. To address the issue of relative incorporation of sentrin-2 into endogenous versus exogenous RanGAP1, HA-sentrin-2 and/or RH-RanGAP1 was expressed in COS cells. The normalized amounts of the entire extracts were probed with three different antibodies (anti-RanGAP1 to detect both endogenous and exogenous RanGAP1, anti-RH to detect exogenous RanGAP1, and anti-HA to detect exogenous sentrin-2). As shown in Fig. 6, all endogenous RanGAP1 proteins were already modified by endogenous sentrins (lanes 1 and 7). Expression of HA-tagged sentrin-2 did not increase the amount of modified RanGAP1 (lane 2). Coexpression of RH-tagged RanGAP1 with HA-tagged sentrin-2 increased the total amount of modified RanGAP1 (lane 3). However, >50% of the exogenous RanGAP1 proteins were not conjugated (lanes 3, 6, and 9). This was not due to the presence of a limiting amount of sentrin-2 because plenty of sentrin-2 monomers were present in the sample (lanes 3,6, and 9). Thus, there appeared to be strict regulation of the total amount of sentrinized RanGAP1 in COS cells. It is possible that the amount of sentrinized RanGAP1 proteins is limited by their binding sites at the nuclear envelope. Interestingly, RH-tagged RanGAP1 appeared to conjugate to sentrin-2 more efficiently than other higher molecular mass proteins (lanes 8 and9). Similar results were obtained when HA-tagged sentrin-1 was coexpressed with RH-tagged RanGAP1 (data not shown). We have previously shown that sentrin-1-modified proteins are localized predominantly in the nucleus (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of sentrin-2-modified proteins was determined as described in our earlier report (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). COS cells were also transfected with HA epitope-tagged sentrin-1, sentrin-2, or ubiquitin and stained with anti-HA antibody (16B12) as described previously (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). HA epitope-tagged sentrin-2 is expressed predominately in the nucleus, with minor cytosolic expression (data not shown). In contrast, HA epitope-tagged ubiquitin is distributed equally in both the nucleus and cytosol (data not shown). Thus, the subcellular localization of both sentrin-1 and sentrin-2 appears to be identical. Protein modification by ubiquitin has been studied extensively in the last 2 decades (13Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 761-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (1210) Google Scholar, 14Jentsch S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1992; 26: 179-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Ubiquitination has been shown to play a critical role in antigen processing, cell cycle regulation, receptor endocytosis, and signal transduction (15Hochstrasser M.

The complexity of the ubiquitination system is further compounded by the identification of other ubiquitin-like molecules, such as UCRP and sentrin. UCRP is a type 1 interferon-inducible protein that contains two ubiquitin domains (30Haas A.L. Ahrens P. Bright P.M. Ankel H. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11315-11323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). UCRP has been shown to be conjugated to a large number of intracellular proteins (31Loeb K.R. Haas A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7806-7813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, the identities of UCRP-modified proteins have not been defined. The discovery of sentrin-1 and the demonstration of its ability to modify RanGAP1 add further excitement to this area of investigation (2Kamitani T. Nguyen H.P. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14001-14004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 4Mahajan R. Delphin C. Guan T. Gerace L. Melchior F.

Our laboratory has recently characterized another ubiquitin-like protein, NEDD8, which could also form protein conjugates in a manner similar to protein ubiquitination (8Kamitani T. Katsumi K. Nguyen R. Yeh E.T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28557-28562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). The results shown in this report establish sentrin-2 as the fourth member, after UCRP, sentrin-1, and NEDD8, of the ubiquitin-like protein modifiers."
https://openalex.org/W2062191082,"Integrin-mediated interaction with the extracellular matrix plays a critical role in the function of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. This study examines the role of p130Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate (Cas)) in actin organization in osteoclasts. Multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were obtained in a co-culture of murine bone marrow cells and primary osteoblasts. After plating on culture dishes, OCLs formed a ringlike structure consisting of F-actin dots at cell periphery (actin ring). The percentage of OCLs with actin rings and its diameter increased with time and cell spreading. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein (p130) increased with actin ring formation. Treatment with cytochalasin D disrupted actin rings and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130. Using specific antibodies, p130 was identified as Cas. By immunocytochemistry, Cas was localized to the peripheral regions of OCLs and its distribution overlapped that of F-actin. In OCLs derived from Src(−/−) mice, in which osteoclast activity is severely compromised, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly reduced. Moreover, Cas was diffusely distributed in the cytoplasm and actin ring formation is not observed. These findings suggest that Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is involved in the adhesion-induced actin organization associated with osteoclast activation. Integrin-mediated interaction with the extracellular matrix plays a critical role in the function of osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells. This study examines the role of p130Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate (Cas)) in actin organization in osteoclasts. Multinucleated osteoclast-like cells (OCLs) were obtained in a co-culture of murine bone marrow cells and primary osteoblasts. After plating on culture dishes, OCLs formed a ringlike structure consisting of F-actin dots at cell periphery (actin ring). The percentage of OCLs with actin rings and its diameter increased with time and cell spreading. Tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein (p130) increased with actin ring formation. Treatment with cytochalasin D disrupted actin rings and reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of p130. Using specific antibodies, p130 was identified as Cas. By immunocytochemistry, Cas was localized to the peripheral regions of OCLs and its distribution overlapped that of F-actin. In OCLs derived from Src(−/−) mice, in which osteoclast activity is severely compromised, tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly reduced.

These findings suggest that Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is involved in the adhesion-induced actin organization associated with osteoclast activation.

It is now established that, in addition to mediating cell adhesion, integrins activate multiple signaling pathways. These include elevation of intracellular Ca2+, lipid turnover, and tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and de novo gene expression (3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). The proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated by ECM-integrin interactions include focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (4Guan J.L.

The recognition of extracellular matrix components is, therefore, an important step in the initiation of osteoclast function. Several studies have demonstrated that αvβ3 integrins play a central role in osteoclast adhesion (11Davies J. Warwick J. Totty N. Philp R. Helfrich M. Horton M. J.

Using murine osteoclast-like multinucleated cells formed in vitro, we have recently reported that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to ECM molecules, such as vitronectin, fibronectin or type I collagen, induces the formation of a ringlike structure of F-actin dots at the cell periphery (17Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This ringlike organization, the actin ring, is formed by the assembly of podosomes that precedes the formation of the sealing zone (18Zambonin-Zallone A. Teti A. Carano A. Marchisio P.C. J.

Actually, various inhibitory agents of osteoclast function disrupt this actin ring (23Suda T. Nakamura I. Jimi E. Takahashi N. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar).In this study, we examined protein-tyrosine phosphorylation occurring during the adhesion-induced actin organization in osteoclasts, and identified p130Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate (Cas)) as a molecule that participates in the signaling cascade of actin ring formation. Cas was originally described as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by either v-src (24Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The recent molecular cloning of Cas has shown that Cas contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, a substrate domain, a proline-rich region, and several tyrosine residues near the C terminus (30Sakai R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The substrate domain, which has 15 potentially phosphorylated tyrosine residues, binds to v-Crk (35Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region near the C terminus and Tyr-762 provide the binding sites for the SH3 and SH2 domains of Src kinase, respectively (36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These structural characteristics indicate that Cas is an adapter molecule, which can transmit cellular signals via interaction with the SH2 and SH3 domains of various signaling molecules. It has already been reported that Cas undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion in fibroblasts (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence presented here shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is involved in adhesion-induced actin organization in osteoclasts and is absent in the compromised osteoclasts of Src(−/−) mice.DISCUSSIONWe have reported previously that actin ring formation in osteoclasts is dependent on the interaction of integrins and matrix proteins (17Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the formation of actin rings in osteoclasts. The findings clearly show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, a novel adaptor molecule, is involved in adhesion-induced actin organization. Cas was originally identified as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein during cellular transformation by v-Src (24Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or v-Crk (27Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2638-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was shown to form stable complexes with these oncoproteins. Recent molecular cloning of Cas identified it as a novel SH3-containing signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding motifs (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is induced by cell adhesion (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that Cas is localized to focal adhesions (33Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,38Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As shown in this study, Cas is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in OCLs after cell adhesion, and co-localizes with F-actin at the cell periphery as a ringlike structure, “the actin ring,” Because the actin ring is considered to be an assembly of podosomes (19Kanehisa J. Yamanaka T. Doi S. Turksen K. Heersche J.N.M. Aubin J.E. Takeuchi H. Bone. 1990; 11: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Teti A. Marchisio P.C. Zambonin-Zallone A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas plays a role in podosome formation. Moreover, treatment of OCLs with cytochalasin D disturbed the intracellular localization of Cas and reduced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (Figs. 6 and 7). Possibly, cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), such as PTP-1B (34Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and PTP-PEST (51Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), may play a role in the dephosphorylation of Cas that is translocated to the cytoplasm by treatment with cytochalasin D. We also reported that the disruption of cytoskeletal organization by cytochalasin D treatment induced the inhibition of osteoclast function (52Sasaki T. Debari K. Udagawa N. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 53: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the close relationship between Cas phosphorylation and actin organization, which is related to osteoclast activity.In normal fibroblastic cells from rats (3Y1) or mice (NIH3T3), Cas has been detected as two bands, Cas A (125 kDa) and Cas B (130 kDa), respectively (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when cells are transformed by v-Crk or v-Src, Cas A is decreased and another broad band of Cas C (130–135 kDa) appears. Because tyrosine phosphorylation is found mostly in Cas C, Cas C may be a modified form of Cas A or Cas B with a retarded gel mobility, secondary to phosphorylation at multiple sites (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In OCLs, however, Cas C was not detected, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas was identified as Cas B (Fig. 6). This might be a result of the fact that osteoclasts are non-transformed cells.The next question is: which tyrosine kinase(s) phosphorylates Cas? Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the candidates, as it is phosphorylated upon adhesion with similar kinetics to those of Cas (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports indicate that FAK can bind to the SH3 domain of Cas in vivo (32Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 33Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal portion of Cas can also bind directly the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src kinase (36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, two lines of evidence have demonstrated that the deficiency of c-Src, but not of FAK, completely abrogated integrin-mediated Cas phosphorylation in fibroblasts (47Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,48Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by integrin engagement is mediated by Src family kinases, especially c-Src, and FAK itself might not be necessary for Cas phosphorylation. This is supported by the findings of this study, which show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly reduced in Src(−/−) OCLs, whereas the expression of Cas was not suppressed (Fig. 8). Moreover, actin rings did not form in Src(−/−) OCLs and Cas was localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9), suggesting that, in osteoclasts, c-Src plays an important role in Cas phosphorylation and in its localization. Considering that Cas phosphorylation is tightly associated with actin ring formation, Src may participate in the control of actin organization in osteoclasts via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. In Src(−/−) mice, osteoclast activity is severely compromised, resulting in osteopetrosis (42Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar, 43Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, Src(−/−) OCLs do not form actin rings. Thus, the lack of Src-dependent Cas phosphorylation may be one of the causes for osteoclast inactivation in Src(−/−) mice. To prove this hypothesis, rescue experiments of Src(−/−) mice using Cas or Cas related molecules are required, and are now in progress.Recently, Nakamoto et al. (53Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that the association of Cas not only with Src kinase but also with FAK family kinases plays a pivotal role in the localization of Cas to focal adhesions in fibroblasts. FAK, which can bind to both Cas and Src family kinases, might recruit Src family kinases to phosphorylated Cas. Considering that Cas has multiple SH2-binding sites, a SH3 region, and a proline-rich region, Cas is likely to associate with various molecules such as Src family kinases, FAK family kinases, paxillin, tensin, and c-Crk, and thus might play a central role in podosome formation in osteoclasts. Further studies are required to determine the hierarchy among these molecules in the osteoclast polarization process. In conclusion, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas appears essential for the signal transduction initiated by cell adhesion, leading to the formation of actin organization in osteoclasts. Integrins are a major family of cell surface receptors that play crucial roles in cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; Cas, Crk-associated substrate; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; SH, Src homology; OCL, osteoclast-like cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; Cas, Crk-associated substrate; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; FAK, focal adhesion kinase; PTP, protein-tyrosine phosphatase; SH, Src homology; OCL, osteoclast-like cell; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; TBS-T, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20. interactions (1Hynes R.O.

It is now established that, in addition to mediating cell adhesion, integrins activate multiple signaling pathways. These include elevation of intracellular Ca2+, lipid turnover, and tyrosine phosphorylation, leading to cytoskeletal rearrangement and de novo gene expression (3Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). The proteins that are tyrosine-phosphorylated by ECM-integrin interactions include focal adhesion kinase (FAK) (4Guan J.L. Shalloway D. Nature. 1992; 358: 690-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar), paxillin (5Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Osteoclasts, the bone-resorbing cells, play a critical role in bone remodeling (8Athanasou N.A. J.

The recognition of extracellular matrix components is, therefore, an important step in the initiation of osteoclast function.

Using murine osteoclast-like multinucleated cells formed in vitro, we have recently reported that integrin-mediated cell adhesion to ECM molecules, such as vitronectin, fibronectin or type I collagen, induces the formation of a ringlike structure of F-actin dots at the cell periphery (17Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This ringlike organization, the actin ring, is formed by the assembly of podosomes that precedes the formation of the sealing zone (18Zambonin-Zallone A. Teti A. Carano A. Marchisio P.C. J.

Res. 1997; 12: 869-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined protein-tyrosine phosphorylation occurring during the adhesion-induced actin organization in osteoclasts, and identified p130Cas (Crk-associatedsubstrate (Cas)) as a molecule that participates in the signaling cascade of actin ring formation. Cas was originally described as a major tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in cells transformed by either v-src (24Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell.

The recent molecular cloning of Cas has shown that Cas contains an N-terminal SH3 domain, a substrate domain, a proline-rich region, and several tyrosine residues near the C terminus (30Sakai R.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The substrate domain, which has 15 potentially phosphorylated tyrosine residues, binds to v-Crk (35Burnham M.R. Harte M.T. Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bouton A.H. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2467-2472PubMed Google Scholar, 36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The proline-rich region near the C terminus and Tyr-762 provide the binding sites for the SH3 and SH2 domains of Src kinase, respectively (36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). These structural characteristics indicate that Cas is an adapter molecule, which can transmit cellular signals via interaction with the SH2 and SH3 domains of various signaling molecules. It has already been reported that Cas undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion in fibroblasts (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence presented here shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is involved in adhesion-induced actin organization in osteoclasts and is absent in the compromised osteoclasts of Src(−/−) mice. DISCUSSIONWe have reported previously that actin ring formation in osteoclasts is dependent on the interaction of integrins and matrix proteins (17Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the formation of actin rings in osteoclasts. The findings clearly show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas, a novel adaptor molecule, is involved in adhesion-induced actin organization. Cas was originally identified as a highly tyrosine-phosphorylated protein during cellular transformation by v-Src (24Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Wang H.-C.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3951-3958Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 25Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1689-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) or v-Crk (27Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 2638-2642Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 28Matsuda M. Mayer B.J. Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Science. 1990; 248: 1537-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Mayer B.J. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10588-10595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was shown to form stable complexes with these oncoproteins. Recent molecular cloning of Cas identified it as a novel SH3-containing signaling molecule with a cluster of multiple putative SH2-binding motifs (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Moreover, several studies have reported that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas is induced by cell adhesion (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and that Cas is localized to focal adhesions (33Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar,38Petch L.A. Bockholt S.M. Bouton A. Parsons J.T. Burridge K. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As shown in this study, Cas is also tyrosine-phosphorylated in OCLs after cell adhesion, and co-localizes with F-actin at the cell periphery as a ringlike structure, “the actin ring,” Because the actin ring is considered to be an assembly of podosomes (19Kanehisa J. Yamanaka T. Doi S. Turksen K. Heersche J.N.M. Aubin J.E. Takeuchi H. Bone. 1990; 11: 287-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 20Lakkakorpi P.T. Väänänen H.K. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 21Teti A. Marchisio P.C. Zambonin-Zallone A. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas plays a role in podosome formation. Moreover, treatment of OCLs with cytochalasin D disturbed the intracellular localization of Cas and reduced Cas tyrosine phosphorylation (Figs. 6 and 7). Possibly, cytosolic protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), such as PTP-1B (34Liu F. Hill D.E. Chernoff J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31290-31295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and PTP-PEST (51Garton A.J. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6408-6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), may play a role in the dephosphorylation of Cas that is translocated to the cytoplasm by treatment with cytochalasin D. We also reported that the disruption of cytoskeletal organization by cytochalasin D treatment induced the inhibition of osteoclast function (52Sasaki T. Debari K. Udagawa N. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1993; 53: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the close relationship between Cas phosphorylation and actin organization, which is related to osteoclast activity.In normal fibroblastic cells from rats (3Y1) or mice (NIH3T3), Cas has been detected as two bands, Cas A (125 kDa) and Cas B (130 kDa), respectively (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). On the other hand, when cells are transformed by v-Crk or v-Src, Cas A is decreased and another broad band of Cas C (130–135 kDa) appears. Because tyrosine phosphorylation is found mostly in Cas C, Cas C may be a modified form of Cas A or Cas B with a retarded gel mobility, secondary to phosphorylation at multiple sites (31Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In OCLs, however, Cas C was not detected, and the tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas was identified as Cas B (Fig. 6). This might be a result of the fact that osteoclasts are non-transformed cells.The next question is: which tyrosine kinase(s) phosphorylates Cas? Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is one of the candidates, as it is phosphorylated upon adhesion with similar kinetics to those of Cas (7Vuori K. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22259-22262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,37Nojima Y. Morino N. Mimura T. Hamasaki K. Furuya H. Sakai R. Sato T. Tachibana K. Morimoto C.

Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, recent reports indicate that FAK can bind to the SH3 domain of Cas in vivo (32Polte T.R. Hanks S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10678-10682Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 33Harte M.T. Hildebrand J.D. Burnham M.R. Bouton A.H. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13649-13655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the C-terminal portion of Cas can also bind directly the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src kinase (36Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Ozawa K. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, two lines of evidence have demonstrated that the deficiency of c-Src, but not of FAK, completely abrogated integrin-mediated Cas phosphorylation in fibroblasts (47Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,48Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by integrin engagement is mediated by Src family kinases, especially c-Src, and FAK itself might not be necessary for Cas phosphorylation. This is supported by the findings of this study, which show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly reduced in Src(−/−) OCLs, whereas the expression of Cas was not suppressed (Fig. 8). Moreover, actin rings did not form in Src(−/−) OCLs and Cas was localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9), suggesting that, in osteoclasts, c-Src plays an important role in Cas phosphorylation and in its localization. Considering that Cas phosphorylation is tightly associated with actin ring formation, Src may participate in the control of actin organization in osteoclasts via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. In Src(−/−) mice, osteoclast activity is severely compromised, resulting in osteopetrosis (42Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar, 43Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, Src(−/−) OCLs do not form actin rings. Thus, the lack of Src-dependent Cas phosphorylation may be one of the causes for osteoclast inactivation in Src(−/−) mice. To prove this hypothesis, rescue experiments of Src(−/−) mice using Cas or Cas related molecules are required, and are now in progress.Recently, Nakamoto et al. (53Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that the association of Cas not only with Src kinase but also with FAK family kinases plays a pivotal role in the localization of Cas to focal adhesions in fibroblasts. FAK, which can bind to both Cas and Src family kinases, might recruit Src family kinases to phosphorylated Cas. Considering that Cas has multiple SH2-binding sites, a SH3 region, and a proline-rich region, Cas is likely to associate with various molecules such as Src family kinases, FAK family kinases, paxillin, tensin, and c-Crk, and thus might play a central role in podosome formation in osteoclasts. Further studies are required to determine the hierarchy among these molecules in the osteoclast polarization process. In conclusion, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas appears essential for the signal transduction initiated by cell adhesion, leading to the formation of actin organization in osteoclasts. We have reported previously that actin ring formation in osteoclasts is dependent on the interaction of integrins and matrix proteins (17Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Sasaki T. Jimi E. Kurokawa T. Suda T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 1873-1879Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined the involvement of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation in the formation of actin rings in osteoclasts.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8959-8965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In addition, two lines of evidence have demonstrated that the deficiency of c-Src, but not of FAK, completely abrogated integrin-mediated Cas phosphorylation in fibroblasts (47Hamasaki K. Mimura T. Morino N. Furuya H. Nakamoto T. Aizawa S. Morimoto C. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Nojima Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,48Vuori K. Hirai H. Aizawa S. Ruoslahti E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2606-2613Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas by integrin engagement is mediated by Src family kinases, especially c-Src, and FAK itself might not be necessary for Cas phosphorylation. This is supported by the findings of this study, which show that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas was markedly reduced in Src(−/−) OCLs, whereas the expression of Cas was not suppressed (Fig. 8). Moreover, actin rings did not form in Src(−/−) OCLs and Cas was localized throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 9), suggesting that, in osteoclasts, c-Src plays an important role in Cas phosphorylation and in its localization. Considering that Cas phosphorylation is tightly associated with actin ring formation, Src may participate in the control of actin organization in osteoclasts via tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas. In Src(−/−) mice, osteoclast activity is severely compromised, resulting in osteopetrosis (42Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar, 43Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) and, as shown here, Src(−/−) OCLs do not form actin rings. Thus, the lack of Src-dependent Cas phosphorylation may be one of the causes for osteoclast inactivation in Src(−/−) mice. To prove this hypothesis, rescue experiments of Src(−/−) mice using Cas or Cas related molecules are required, and are now in progress. Recently, Nakamoto et al. (53Nakamoto T. Sakai R. Honda H. Ogawa S. Ueno H. Suzuki T. Aizawa S. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3884-3897Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) reported that the association of Cas not only with Src kinase but also with FAK family kinases plays a pivotal role in the localization of Cas to focal adhesions in fibroblasts. FAK, which can bind to both Cas and Src family kinases, might recruit Src family kinases to phosphorylated Cas. Considering that Cas has multiple SH2-binding sites, a SH3 region, and a proline-rich region, Cas is likely to associate with various molecules such as Src family kinases, FAK family kinases, paxillin, tensin, and c-Crk, and thus might play a central role in podosome formation in osteoclasts. Further studies are required to determine the hierarchy among these molecules in the osteoclast polarization process. In conclusion, Src-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Cas appears essential for the signal transduction initiated by cell adhesion, leading to the formation of actin organization in osteoclasts.

Yasuhisa Fukui and Sayoko Ihara (University of Tokyo) for their help in Western blot analyses and to Lorraine Lipfert (Merck Research Laboratories) for critical reading and fruitful discussion."
https://openalex.org/W2129768961,"A full-length E(ecto)-ATPase (Plesner, L. (1995)Int. Rev. Cytol. 158, 141–214) cDNA was cloned from a human brain cDNA library; it encodes a 610-amino acid protein that contains two putative transmembrane domains. Heterologous expression of this protein in COS-7 cells caused a significant increase in intracellular membrane-bound nucleoside phosphatase activity. The activity was highest with UDP as substrate and was stimulated by divalent cations in the following order: Ca2+ ≫ Mg2+ > Mn2+. The results of immunofluorescence staining indicate that this protein is located in the Golgi apparatus. UDP hydrolysis was increased in the presence of Triton X-100 or alamethicin, an ionophore that facilitates movement of UDP across the membrane, suggesting that the active site of this UDPase is on the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus. This is the first identification of a mammalian Golgi luminal UDPase gene. Computer-aided sequence analysis of the EATPase superfamily indicates that the human UDPase is highly similar to two hypothetical proteins of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans and to an unidentified 71.9-kDa yeast protein and is less related to the previously identified yeast Golgi GDPase."

Mutations, alterations of genetic information, are believed to cause various diseases and are generated by many environmental mutagens such as ROS, 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; 8-OH-Gua, 8-hydroxyguanine; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; 2-OH-Ade, 2-hydroxyadenine; 8-OH-dGTP, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-triphosphate; 2-OH-dAMP, 2-hydroxy-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-monophosphate; 2-OH-dATP, 2-hydroxy-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; LB, Luria-Bertani; P-gal, phenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; MF, mutation frequency; 8-OH-dGMP, 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine 5′-monophosphate. ultraviolet, X-, and γ-rays, and alkylating agents, in addition to mispair formation during replication. Among them, ROS are believed to be very important sources of mutations and to be involved in mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, and aging (1Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2742) Google Scholar, 2Harman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 7124-7128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar) because ROS are generated endogenously by normal oxygen metabolism and are also produced by many environmental mutagens and carcinogens. Among the forms of oxidative DNA damage reported, 8-OH-Gua (3Kasai H. Nishimura S. Sies H. Oxidative Stress II: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, New York1991: 99-116Google Scholar) is recognized as an important lesion because of its mutagenicity (4Wood M.L. Dizdaroglu M. Gajewski E. Essigmann J.M.

This modified base is used widely as a marker of DNA oxidation (3Kasai H. Nishimura S. Sies H. Oxidative Stress II: Oxidants and Antioxidants. Academic Press, New York1991: 99-116Google Scholar, 10Asami S. Hirano T. Yamaguchi R. Tomioka Y. Itoh H. Kasai H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2546-2549PubMed Google Scholar) because of its sensitive detection by an HPLC system connected to an electrochemical detector. An oxidized form of adenine, 2-OH-Ade, is produced by Fenton-type reactions of deoxyadenosine derivatives (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,12Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Muraoka M. Kaji H. Kasai H. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The yields of 2-OH-Ade are similar to those of 8-OH-Gua in the monomeric form, although its formation in DNA is less efficient. It was reported that the treatment of cultured human cells with H2O2 induces 2-OH-Ade accumulation in DNA (one-fifth of that of 8-OH-Gua) (13Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1389-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Moreover, 2-OH-Ade possesses mutation inducibility similar to that of 8-OH-Gua in Escherichia coli and mammalian cells (14Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 15Kamiya H. Kasai H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11125-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, 2-OH-Ade appears to be another important form of DNA damage produced by ROS. An oxidative DNA lesion is likely to be formed through two pathways. One is the direct oxidation of a residue in DNA, and another is the incorporation of an oxidatively damaged DNA precursor by a DNA polymerase(s). In fact, it was shown that the two pathways contribute almost equally to the formation of 8-OH-Gua in DNA (16Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Moreover, the presence of the MutT protein and its mammalian counterpart, which hydrolyze the mutagenic nucleotide 8-OH-dGTP, indicates that the prevention of its incorporation into DNA is important in organisms (17Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar,18Mo J.-Y. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11021-11025Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Thus, it is necessary to determine the mutagenicity of an oxidatively damaged DNA precursor in cells to reveal the overall effects on the mutations induced by ROS. However, few studies on the mutagenic potential of an oxidatively damaged DNA precursor have been reported. 8-OH-dGTP is used as a substrate by DNA polymerases and is inserted opposite C and A in the template DNA (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). We reported the insertion of 2-OH-dAMP opposite T and C by the mammalian DNA polymerase α (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The incorporation of 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine 5′-triphosphate and 5-formyldeoxyuridine 5′-triphosphate opposite A and G has also been reported (19Purmal A.A. Kow Y.W. Wallace S.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3930-3935Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 20Yoshida M. Makino K. Morita H. Terato H. Ohyama Y. Ide H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1570-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Minnick et al. (21Minnick D.T. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) used 8-OH-dGTP as a substrate in SV40 origin-dependent DNA replication with the use of a human cell extract (21Minnick D.T. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). All of these studies were conducted in vitro, and to our knowledge, the mutagenicity of a damaged nucleotide in vivo has never been reported. In this study we introduced two important oxidatively damaged purine nucleotides, 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP (Fig. 1), into E. coli and analyzed the induction of mutations in the lacI gene on the chromosomal DNA. 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP were similarly mutagenicin vivo and elicited A·T → C·G and G·C → T·A transversions, respectively. This new method enables the evaluation and comparison of the mutagenic potentials of damaged DNA precursorsin vivo. All chemicals for the E. coli media were as described (22Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Kaji H. Kasai H. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23Ono T. Negishi K. Hayatsu H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 326: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 24Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992Google Scholar). The E. coli strains W3110 (wild type, F −) and DH5α (F −,φ80d lacZΔM15 Δ (lacZYA-argF) U169,endA1,recA1,hsdS17 (rk− mk+),deoR,thi-1, supE44, λ−,gyrA96, relA1) were used. RecombinantTaq DNA polymerase was purchased from Nacalai Tesque Inc. The dATP used for the preparation of 2-OH-dATP was from Sigma. Nucleotides for control treatments were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Digoxygenin-labeled oligonucleotides and other unmodified oligonucleotides were from Nissinbo (Tokyo, Japan) and from Hokkaido System Science Co. (Sapporo, Japan), respectively, in purified forms. 8-OH-dGTP was prepared as described previously (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2-OH-dATP was prepared by the treatment of dATP with Fe(II)-EDTA-O2 and was purified by HPLC as described (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Selection oflacI − mutants was carried out by the method of Miller (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). A white colony (the lacI + genotype) of W3110 was taken from an 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside minimum plate and was inoculated into Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. The E. coli culture was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and competent cells were prepared by treatment with 0.1 m calcium chloride as described (23Ono T. Negishi K. Hayatsu H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 326: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To 195 μl of the E. coli suspension, 5 μl of nucleotide solution was added, and the mixture was placed on ice for 30 min. After heat shock treatment (42 °C for 2 min and then 0 °C for 2 min), 800 μl of LB medium was added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. A portion of the culture was diluted, transferred onto an LB agar plate, and incubated at 37 °C overnight. Another portion of the culture was transferred onto a P-gal plate and was incubated at 37 °C for 3 days. The colonies that grew on the P-gal plate contain a mutation in either the lacI orlacO gene and were scored as mutants (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The mutation frequency (MF) was calculated according to the numbers of colonies on the P-gal and LB plates. The lacI − mutants were selected from the mixture of lacI − andlacO c mutants on the P-gal plates as described (25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The isolated mutants were inoculated into 0.5 ml of LB medium and were incubated at 37 °C overnight. The chromosomal DNA was isolated from the E. coli cells containing the mutatedlacI − gene with a SepaGene kit (Sanko Junyaku). The DNA fragment containing the lacI − gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction as described previously (22Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Kaji H. Kasai H. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,23Ono T. Negishi K. Hayatsu H. Mutat. Res. 1995; 326: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The presence of an addition or deletion of the 5′-TGGC-3′ sequence, which is detected frequently in the case of spontaneous mutations in the lacI gene, was judged by dot-blot hybridization. The amplified lacI fragments were heat denatured and blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Protoran, Schleicher & Schuell) and were fixed by UV-cross-linking. A probe labeled with digoxygenin at the 5′-end was used in the hybridization. The sequences of the probes were 5′-dTCTGGCTGGCTGGCTGGCAT-3′ and 5′-dTGCGTCTGGCTGGCATAA-3′. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C. Positive signals were detected by the DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit (Boehringer Mannheim). The nucleotide sequences of the lacI gene fragments were analyzed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction products using an Applied Biosystems PRISM Dye Primer Cycle Sequencing Kit (Perkin-Elmer) and an Applied Biosystems model 373S DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) as described previously (22Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Kaji H. Kasai H. Mutat. Res. 1997; 377: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The E. coli W3110 treated with 8-OH-dGTP as described above was incubated at 37 °C for an additional 60 min in LB medium. After centrifugation, the E. coli pellet was washed with ice-cold LB medium to remove unincorporated 8-OH-dGTP. Control E. coli was treated similarly. The chromosomal DNAs were extracted from 8-OH-dGTP-treated and control bacteria using a DNA Extractor WB Kit (Wako Pure Chemicals). The 8-OH-Gua content was measured by the HPLC-electrochemical detector method after complete digestion as described (10Asami S. Hirano T. Yamaguchi R. Tomioka Y. Itoh H. Kasai H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 2546-2549PubMed Google Scholar). Competent DH5α cells were prepared as described (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). To 100 μl of the E. coli suspension, 5 μl of the solution containing 1 ng (0.29 fmol) of pMY189 (27Matsuda T. Yagi T. Kawanishi M. Matsui S. Takebe H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2389-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and 25 nmol of a nucleotide was added. The transformation was carried out by the standard method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). We treated wild type E. coli W3110 with various deoxyribonucleotides, and the frequencies oflacI − and lacO c mutations in the chromosomal DNA were measured. When 50 nmol of either dGTP or dATP was added to the bacteria, the MF observed was very similar to that of the control (no addition of nucleotide) (TableI). On the other hand, the MF was found to be increased when 50 nmol of either 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP was added. The relative MFs were increased about 2.5-fold over the control value by the addition of 50 nmol of either 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP (Table I). 2-OH-dATP appeared to induce more mutations than 8-OH-dGTP. Moreover, the increases in the MF were dependent on the amount of the nucleotides added (Table I). These results indicate that the two oxidatively damaged nucleotides were mutagenic in vivo, as speculated from the results of in vitro experiments (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar,17Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). No decrease in the survival ratio (number of colonies on LB plates) was observed by the addition of the damaged nucleotides under the conditions used (data not shown and see below).Table IFrequency of mutations in the lacI and lacO genes induced by addition of nucleotidesNucleotide added1-aNucleotides added to a 200-μl suspension of competent E. coli are shown.Mutation frequency (×10−5)1-bRelative mutation frequencies are shown in parentheses.Experiment I1-cFour separate experiments.

Open table in a new tab We analyzed the sequences of thelacI gene in the lacI − mutants obtained by the treatments with 50 nmol of nucleotide (89 and 86 cases for 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, respectively). 61 mutants obtained with the control experiments were also analyzed. TableII shows the summary of the sequence analyses. The addition or deletion of the 5′-TGGC-3′ sequence was detected in 84% of the mutants in the control experiments. This type of mutation has been reported as the most frequent mutation in thelacI gene (22Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Kaji H. Kasai H. Mutat.

Open table in a new tab On the other hand, the ratios of the TGGC addition or deletion were decreased in the case of the mutations induced by 8-OH-dGTP. The TGGC mutations were observed in only 22% of the mutants (Table II). Single base substitutions made up 76% of the mutations induced by 8-OH-dGTP. Because the MF was increased 2.4-fold by the addition of 8-OH-dGTP (Table I), it is estimated that the frequency of single base substitutions was increased by 12-fold. The mutation found most frequently in the 8-OH-dGTP-induced mutants was an A·T → C·G transversion (Table II). This type of mutation was observed in 69% of the mutant colonies. It was already shown that a DNA polymerase incorporates 8-OH-dGMP opposite A and C in template DNAs in vitro (17Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar) and that the incorporation of 8-OH-dGMP elicits A·T → C·G transversions (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A.

Thus, the present result agrees with the previous reports and indicated that the same event occurs in vivo. 51% of the mutations induced by 2-OH-dATP were single base substitutions (Table II). Because the MF increased 2.5-fold by the addition of 2-OH-dATP (Table I), the single base substitutions were increased 9-fold. G·C → T·A transversions were the mutations detected most frequently (43% of the total mutations). This type of mutation appears to occur by the incorporation of 2-OH-dAMP opposite G residues in DNA (see under “Discussion”). The addition/deletion of the 5′-TGGC-3′ sequence was shared by 48% of the mutants. This value was higher than expected. The 2-OH-Ade residue may be involved in the generation of the TGGC mutations. The distribution of the mutations induced by the two damaged nucleotides is shown in Fig. 2. There were a few minor hot spots: position 886 for 8-OH-dGTP and positions 782 and 918 for 2-OH-dATP (Fig. 2). These facts suggest that the incorporations of the damaged nucleotides were not uniform. Another interesting feature was the strand preference of the G·C → T·A transversions induced by 2-OH-dATP. Of the 37 G·C → T·A transversions observed, the numbers of mutants containing a G → T transversion and a C → A transversion were 27 and 10, respectively (about 3/1, Fig. 2). This was not caused by an abundance of G residues in the nontranscribed strand (the strand shown in Fig. 2), since G and C bases are similarly present (G/C = 1.06). This result suggests that the 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated preferentially opposite G residues in the nontranscribed strand of the lacI gene. In the case of 8-OH-dGTP, no preferences for the transcribed strand were observed (28/33, nontranscribed/transcribed). Next we searched for the effects of the 5′- and 3′-flanking bases on the A → C transversions induced by 8-OH-dGTP (TableIII). The site where the transversions occurred most frequently was a 5′-TAA-3′ sequence, in which the mutated A base is underlined (17 cases). This mutation in the 5′-TAA-3′ sequences occurred more than twice as frequently as the mutations in other sequences. Because 5′-TA M-3′ (M = any base) sequences are present at two-thirds to one-half of the frequencies of other sequences, this observed preference can be interpreted more effectively. The frequency of A → C mutations in 5′-GA M-3′ (M = any base) sequences was less than those in other sequences (Table III).Table IIIEffects of the nearest neighboring bases on A → C transversions induced by 8-OH-dGTP5′-Flanking base3′-Flanking baseTotalGATCG02709A053614T2171121C813517Total1025141261 Open table in a new tab Clearer effects of the nearest neighboring bases were found for the G → T transversions induced by 2-OH-dATP. The G → T mutations occurred at the G residues in 5′-GGG-3′ and 5′-GGT-3′ sequences (14 and 8 cases, TableIV). The G → T mutation in other sites appears to distribute similarly. The G → T mutations were detected frequently at the G residues in the 5′-GG M-3′ (26 cases) sequences, whereas only one case was detected in the 5′-TG M-3′ sequences. Thus, the effects of the 5′-flanking base appear to be quite large in the case of 2-OH-dATP.Table IVEffects of the nearest neighboring bases on G → T transversions induced by 2-OH-dATP5′-Flanking base3′-Flanking baseTotalGATCG1428226A10113T00101C12317Total16413437 Open table in a new tab Competent W3110 cells were treated with 33P-labeled 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP, and radioactivities in the treated cells were counted after thorough washing and lysis. We observed that 1.3% and 0.3% of the added 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, respectively, were present in cells. Thus, the damaged nucleotides entered E. coli cells. Moreover, these results indicate that 8-OH-dGTP was incorporated into the cells 4.5-fold more than 2-OH-dATP. We next measured 8-OH-Gua content in chromosomal DNA of 8-OH-dGTP-treated bacteria. 8-OH-Gua was detected by the HPLC-electrochemical detector, a method with high sensitivity. We found that the 8-OH-Gua level of the treated cells was 1.58/105Gua. We observed that the 8-OH-Gua level of the E. colitreated without 8-OH-dGTP was 0.57/105 Gua. Thus, 8-OH-Gua level of 1.01/105 Gua over the background was induced by the treatment with 8-OH-dGTP, suggesting that the added damaged nucleotide entered bacterial cells and was incorporated by DNA polymerase III. Note that in these experiments, we incubated the bacteria for an additional 60 min (compared with 45 min in mutagenesis experiments) because of the amount of DNA required. We speculate that the ratio of 8-OH-Gua may be decreased by cell division and repair processes during this incubation period. Thus, the 8-OH-Gua content was estimated to be higher than 1.58/105 Gua when the bacteria were transferred onto LB and P-gal plates in mutagenesis experiments. In the experiments with W3110, the numbers of E. coli colonies on the LB plates were very similar in all cases (data not shown). Thus, the addition of an oxidatively damaged nucleotide did not appear to decrease the survival ratio under the conditions used. This observation may be the result of a low efficiency of the nucleotide incorporation into the cells. To know whether the incorporation of an oxidatively damaged nucleotide was cytotoxic, 2-OH-dATP or 8-OH-dGTP was introduced intoE. coli together with a plasmid containing a selection marker gene, and the survival ratio was measured. We used competentE. coli DH5α cells, which are frequently employed for transfection experiments, and a plasmid containing β-lactamase gene (pMY189) (27Matsuda T. Yagi T. Kawanishi M. Matsui S. Takebe H. Carcinogenesis. 1995; 16: 2389-2394Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Competent DH5α cells were treated with pMY189 together with 108 excess amount (25 nmol) of the damaged nucleotide. We counted the number of transformants on an agar plate containing ampicillin as an indicator of the cytotoxicity. Introduction of the damaged nucleotides reduced the transforming efficiency when compared with the case of plasmid alone (TableV). On the other hand, the presence of either dATP or dGTP did not affect the transforming efficiency (TableV). Thus, either damaged nucleotides, 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP, proved cytotoxic to cells after incorporation.Table VCytotoxic effects of damaged nucleotides in E. coliNucleotide added5-aNucleotides added to a 100-μl suspension of competent E. coli DH5α are shown.E. colicolony obtained (×10−4)5-bAmpicillin-resistant colonies obtained by transfection with pMY189.

Open table in a new tab 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, two major forms of oxidatively damaged DNA precursors, induced lacI − andlacO c mutations with nearly equal frequencies (TableI). Taken together with the mutation spectra data (Table II), we estimated that the frequencies of single base substitution mutations were increased by 12- and 9-fold with 8-OH-dGTP and 2-OH-dATP, respectively (see “Results”). Because 8-OH-dGTP got into E. coli 4.5-fold more than 2-OH-dATP, the actual mutagenicity of substitutions of 2-OH-dATP was calculated to be about 3-fold that of 8-OH-dGTP. These results imply that the mutagenic potential of 2-OH-dATP is as important as that of 8-OH-dGTP, when present in the nucleotide pool. Since the formation of the 2-OH-Ade base in monomers by ROS is comparable with that of 8-OH-Gua (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 12Murata-Kamiya N. Kamiya H. Muraoka M. Kaji H. Kasai H. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 121-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), the production of 2-OH-dATP appears to be similar to that of 8-OH-dGTP. Thus, 2-OH-dATP and 8-OH-dGTP may contribute nearly equally to mutagenesis pathways in which the oxidation of DNA precursors is involved. 8-OH-dGTP induced A·T → C·G transversions almost exclusively (Table II). This finding can be interpreted as follows. DNA polymerase III incorporated 8-OH-dGMP opposite A residues in the DNA, and the polymerase inserted C opposite the 8-OH-Gua bases during the next round of replication (Fig. 3). Similar results have been obtained by the combination of in vitro DNA synthesis and transfection of the synthesized DNA (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Minnick D.T. Pavlov Y.I. Kunkel T.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, the new method appears to be effective for the investigation of the mutational properties of a damaged DNA precursor in vivo. 2-OH-dATP induced G·C → T·A transversions in the lacIgene (Table II). This finding implies that either 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated opposite G, and then dTMP was inserted opposite the incorporated 2-OH-Ade residue during the next round of replication (Fig. 3), or 2-OH-dAMP was incorporated opposite C, and then dAMP was inserted opposite the incorporated 2-OH-Ade residue during the next round of replication. Because 2-OH-Ade residues in single-stranded plasmid vectors are “read” as A with more than 99% probability (14Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the former explanation is most likely. Thus it is probable that the DNA polymerase III of E. coli incorporated 2-OH-dAMP opposite the G residues in the DNA. This conclusion is in contrast to our previous finding that the mammalian DNA polymerase α, another replicative DNA polymerase, inserts 2-OH-dAMP opposite the C residues in DNA (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, a 2-OH-Ade·G pair is formed when the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I inserts dGMP opposite 2-OH-Ade during in vitro DNA synthesis (30Kamiya H. Kasai H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 113-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 31Kamiya H. Ueda T. Ohgi T. Matsukage A. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, an A → C transversion is induced by 2-OH-Ade in plasmid vectors inE. coli (14Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), whereas this type of mutation is not elicited in simian cells (15Kamiya H. Kasai H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11125-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, prokaryotic DNA polymerases may characteristically form the 2-OH-Ade·G pair. The reasons why the mispairing properties of 2-OH-Ade are dependent upon the DNA polymerases are not clear. One possibility is the difference in hydrophobicities of the active site of each polymerase. 2-OH-Ade forms two tautomers, the 2-hydroxy (enol) and 1,2-dihydro-2-oxo (keto) isomers (see Fig. 1). This equilibrium may be affected by the microenvironment around the base (32Seela J. Wei C. Kazimierczuk Z. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1995; 78: 1843-1854Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Sepiol J. Kazimierczuk Z. Shugar D. Z. Naturforsch. 1976; 31C: 361-370Crossref Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Thus, the difference in the hydrophobicity of the active site may affect the enol-keto equilibrium. This putative shift would have an important effect on the formation of a base pair involving 2-OH-Ade (11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19446-19450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 31Kamiya H. Ueda T. Ohgi T. Matsukage A. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 761-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We transfected competent E. coli DH5α cells with a plasmid containing β-lactamase gene in the presence of 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP. The number of transformants on an agar plate containing ampicillin was less than that of the transformants obtained with the plasmid alone (Table V). This effect was not due to the inhibition of transformation by the presence of dNTP and/or the increase in ionic strength because the normal nucleotides did not have any effect (TableV). These results indicate that either damaged nucleotide, 8-OH-dGTP or 2-OH-dATP, was cytotoxic to cells upon incorporation. These effects may be the result of mutations in the β-lactamase gene on the plasmid and/or in other essential gene(s) on the chromosome. Alternatively, extension reaction from an 8-OH-Gua or 2-OH-Ade residue at the 3′-end of a primer may block DNA replication. The other possibility is the replication block during translesional synthesis past these residues in the templates. This possibility is unlikely for 2-OH-Ade because the oxidized adenine in double-stranded DNA does not induce the replication block (14Kamiya H. Kasai H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 304-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is very important that 2-OH-dATP elicited the G·C → T·A transversion, which is one of the mutations frequently induced by ROS. To date, this mutation is thought to be mediated by the formation of 8-OH-Gua in the DNA. However, the formation of 2-OH-dATP in the nucleotide pool will elicit this kind of mutation in bacteria, as shown in this study (Table II). In addition, the G·C → T·A transversion occurs by a lipid peroxidation system without an increase in the formation of 8-OH-Gua in DNA (34Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1994; 315: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the G·C → T·A transversion and other mutations appear to occur by a variety of pathways and not just by a single DNA lesion. The MutT protein hydrolyzes 8-OH-dGTP to produce the cognate monophosphate (17Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). This function prevents mutations by the damaged nucleotide. Thus, in mutT strains, 8-OH-dGTP will induce more mutations than observed in this study. It is possible that a MutT-like activity may eliminate 2-OH-dATP, which was as mutagenic as 8-OH-dGTP (Table I). Further studies will be necessary to determine the involvement of the putative MutT-like activity in the prevention of mutations induced by various oxidized deoxynucleoside triphosphates. One of our major objectives was to establish a new method to evaluate the mutagenicity of a damaged DNA precursor (deoxynucleoside 5′-triphosphate) in vivo. To our knowledge, the mispairing properties of an oxidatively damaged DNA precursor have been evaluated by in vitro DNA polymerase reactions and by mutagenesis experiments using vector DNA in which the oxidized precursor is incorporated by in vitro DNA synthesis (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Kamiya H. Kasai H. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5658-5664Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). It should be emphasized that the MutT-like activity is a factor in the determination of the mutagenicity of damaged nucleotides in thein vivo method. Thus, our new approach will effectively complement the in vitro method. One may think that this new method resembles experiments in which modified nucleosides are added to the culture medium (35Kasai H. Iida A. Yamaizumi Z. Nishimura S. Tanooka H. Mutat. Res. 1990; 243: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this type of experiment, a modified nucleoside must be converted to the cognate triphosphate prior to the incorporation into DNA. The total efficiency of the kination reactions is very different, depending upon the structure of the modified nucleoside. However, our approach eliminates the effects of differences in the enzymatic kination reaction efficiency and directly evaluates the mutagenicity of damaged nucleoside triphosphates. Another major objective was to investigate the mutational properties of 2-OH-dATP, which is produced by ROS. We demonstrated that 2-OH-dATP was as mutagenic as 8-OH-dGTP (Table I). Moreover, 8-OH-Gua and 2-OH-Ade in double-stranded DNA induce mutations with similar frequencies inE. coli and mammalian cells (5Cheng K.C. Cahill D.S. Kasai H. Nishimura S. Loeb L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 166-172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wagner J. Kamiya H. Fuchs R.P.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 7Kamiya H. Miura K.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11125-11130Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These results indicate that 2-OH-Ade is an important oxidative lesion. Furthermore, 2-OH-Ade in DNA appears to be repaired less efficiently in cells. 2Y. Tsurudome, T. Hirano, H. Kamiya, R. Yamaguchi, S. Asami, H. Itoh, and H. Kasai, unpublished data. Thus, even if the extent of 2-OH-Ade formation in DNA is low, the 2-OH-Ade might be accumulated in DNA more easily than 8-OH-Gua. 2-OH-Ade might play an important role in the mutagenesis pathways of aging and carcinogenesis."

These phenomena have been investigated by supplying known proteases involved in blood coagulation, fibrinolysis, or digestion to neural cell cultures. However, the observations that the proteases are mainly localized in and released from non-neural cells do not support all of such neural effects (5Tsirka S.E. Gualandris A. Amaral D.G. Strickland S.

For infection, cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 500 × g at room temperature and resuspended in serum-free SF900II medium. Cells at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were infected with recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Three to five days postinfection, the incubation medium was harvested by removing the cells by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was clarified by centrifugation at 4 °C, 25,000 × g, for 1 h and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 days. The supernatant was then concentrated using Spectrapore Membranes (M r 3500) against polyethylene glycol 20,000 at 4 °C and dialyzed against 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). This solution was subjected to anion exchange chromatography using a 6-ml column of Resource S. Bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of 0 to 1 m NaCl in 50 min at a flow rate of 2 ml/min; NP was eluted at 0.44–0.58 m NaCl. For further purification, the protein was concentrated by Centricon 10 (Amicon), dialyzed against 50 mm HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl (pH 7.4), and gel-filtrated with a 10 × 300-mm column of Superdex 75 HR. The recombinant protein samples were then applied to SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining under both reducing and non-reducing conditions as described below. The expressed recombinant protein had no or only low amidolytic activity, and this was assumed to be pro-NP (r-pro-NP) (Table I).Table IEnzyme activities of r-proNP, r-NP, and brain NP toward various synthetic substratesSubstrateSpecific activityr-proNPr-NPBrain NPUnits1-aOne unit of activity was defined as that required to hydrolyze 1 μmol/min chromogen./mg proteinUnits/mg proteinUnits/mg protein%%Boc-Val-Pro Arg-MCA0.016.26 (100)1.23 (100)Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA04.88 (78)0.50 (41)d-Val-Leu-Arg-pNA01.75 (28)0.38 (31)Boc-Ala-Gly-Pro-Arg-MCA—1-b—, not tested.1.7 (27)—Boc-Glte-Gly-Arg-MCA—1.48 (24)0.30 (24)Boc-Asp-Pro-Arg-MCA—1.41 (22)—Boc-Glu-Gly-Arg-MCA—1.33 (21)—d-Val-Leu-Lys-pNA1.27 (20)0.29 (24)Boc-Pyr1-1004Pyr, Pyroglutamyl.-Gly-Arg-MCA—1.27 (20)0.34 (28)Boc-Glu-Lys-Lys-MCA—1.21 (19)0.27 (22)Boc-Leu-Thr-Arg-MCA—1.07 (17)—Boc-Leu-Arg-Arg-MCA1.01 (16)—Z-Pro-Phe-Arg-pNA—0.79 (13)—Boc-Gly Arg-Arg-MCA—0.71 (11)—Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr MCA—0 (0)0 (0)Z-Phe-Arg-MCA—0 (0)0 (0)Bz-Tyr-pNA—0 (0)0 (0)Bz-l-Arg pNA—0 (0)0 (0)Bz-l-Leu-pNA—0 (0)0 (0)N-Bz-dl-Lys-pNA—0 (0)0 (0)1-c Glt, glutaryl.1-a One unit of activity was defined as that required to hydrolyze 1 μmol/min chromogen.1-b —, not tested.1-d Pyr, Pyroglutamyl.

After titration of rat serum by Western blotting, the rats were intraperitoneally boosted with 50 μg of the r-pro-NP on 2 days before cell fusion. Isolated spleen cells from the immunized rats were fused with Y3Ag.1.2.3 rat myeloma cells (10Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After selection in hypoxanthine/aminopterin/thymidine medium, the supernatants of hybridomas were screened for production of specific antibodies to r-pro-NP by Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using microplates coated with r-pro-NP. Positive clones were used for the production of ascites in pristane-primed nude rats (F344/N Jcl). We screened for the clone producing the most specific monoclonal antibody with the highest titer. The monoclonal antibodies (mAbF12 and mAbB5) were purified from ascites by affinity chromatography on protein G-Sepharose. Neither antibody showed cross-reactivity against serine proteases localized in the brain such as α-thrombin, trypsin, kallikrein, tissue, or urokinase plasminogen activator (11Momota Y. Yoshida S. Ito J. Shibata M. Kato K. Sakurai K. Matsumoto K. Shiosaka S. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 10: 760-764Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out using 12.5% gels (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar), followed by silver staining (13Dammerval C. Le Guilloux M. Blaisonneau J. de Vienne D. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 158-159Crossref Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The electrophoresed protein was transferred from the gels onto nitrocellulose membranes which were then incubated overnight with anti-NP monoclonal antibody diluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Tween 20 and 0.15 m NaCl at 4 °C. After washing with the same buffer, the blotted membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rat IgG diluted with 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 1% Tween 20, 0.15 m NaCl, and 5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h. Immunoreactivity was visualized with 0.04% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 1.2% NH3NiSO4 in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.04% H2O2. Protease 1 (EC3.4.21.50) and trypsin (EC 3.4.21.4) were used for activational processing of r-pro-NP, the enzymatically inactive form. Protease 1 more effectively processed r-pro-NP than trypsin, converting it to the active form, and was thus used in the subsequent experiments. Protease 1 was immobilized on CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B prior to use and was used to convert r-pro-NP to r-NP. Briefly, Sepharose 4B was washed several times with coupling buffer (0.5 m NaCl in 0.1m NaHCO3 (pH 8.3)). Ten mg of protease 1 dissolved in the coupling buffer was added to 1 g of the gel. After incubation in 0.2 m glycine (pH 8.0) to block free CNBr residues, the Sepharose 4B-immobilized protease 1 was washed several times with either 0.5 m NaCl in 0.1 mTris-HCl (pH 8.0) or 0.5 m NaCl in 0.1 macetate buffer (pH 4.0). The immobilized protease 1 was stored in 0.1m Tris-HCl buffer (pH. 8.0) containing 0.5 mNaCl. In special cases, protease 1 which was not immobilized on the gel was also used (cf. Fig. 2). N-terminal amino acid sequencing of r-NP was performed with an ABI 477 pulsed liquid sequencer using standard sequencing chemistry. Purified samples were spotted onto Immobilon membranes (Millipore) 5 mm in diameter and were put on top of a UF membrane. The Immobilon membranes with bound protein were then washed with 50% methanol and sequenced by Edman degradation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) was performed using PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA) Voyager Elite. The accelerating voltage of the ion source was 25 kV. Data were acquired with a 20 MHz digitizer. The matrix used for r-NP and r-pro-NP was sinapinic acid. The matrix material was dissolved in aqueous CH3CN (33%, v/v) to give a saturated solution. Ten pmol of r-NP or r-pro-NP was mixed with the matrix prior to loading on the plate. Bovine serum albumin and 2-thioredoxin were used as molecular mass standards. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained from human blood from a volunteer donor containing 3.5% sodium citrate. Platelets were isolated by gel filtration with a Sepharose 2B column in HEPES-Tyrode's buffer. Aggregation was performed at 37 °C with 200 μl of 2 × 108platelets/ml containing 150 μg of fibrinogen in an aggregometer (Aggretec model TE-500 ERMER). Varying concentrations of thrombin (0.1 and 0.5 units) or r-NP (0.1, 1, and 2 units) were added to the aggregometer tube. Aliquots of 4 μg of human plasma fibronectin were incubated with 0.4 μg of r-pro-NP or r-NP in 20 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0). Reaction was performed at 37 °C for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h and was then terminated by boiling for 3 min with loading buffer (5 μl of 60 mm Tris-HCl (pH. 6.8) containing 2% SDS, 7% glycerol, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). Samples were electrophoresed on 6.25% polyacrylamide gels, followed by Coomassie Blue staining. To analyze cleavage sites of fibronectin by r-NP, the digestion products were electrophoresed and transferred onto Immobilon membranes. The transferred bands on membranes corresponding to degraded fibronectin were cut out and subjected to N-terminal sequencing as described above. Affinity gel was prepared using the monoclonal antibody produced as described above. Six mg of mAbB5 was dialyzed against 0.1 m carbonate buffer (pH 9.0) overnight. CNBr-activated Sepharose CL-6B was activated and coupled to mAbB5. Adult BALB/c mouse brains (10 g) were homogenized with 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100 and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to a mAbB5-coupled affinity column equilibrated with 10 mmsodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.3 m NaCl. Elution was performed with 0.17 m glycine HCl (pH 2.3) into tubes containing 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 9.0), for neutralization. Fractions were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE-silver staining by Western blotting and by assay for amidolytic activity (described below). Amidolytic activities of r-NP and brain NP were monitored by release of MCA or pNA from the synthetic substrates listed above. Assay mixtures containing chromogenic substrates at 100 μm and 45 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and 10 μl of r-NP or brain NP samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Released MCA and pNA were measured with a Hitachi fluorescent colorimeter equipped with 370-nm excitation and 460-nm absorption filters, and with a Bio-Rad microplate reader with a 405-nm absorbance filter, respectively. Kinetic analysis of r-NP and brain NP was performed by incubation of 100 ng of enzyme and increasing concentrations of amidolytic substrates at 37 °C for 30 min. The kinetic parameters of amidolysis were determined using a double-reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot for the rate of release of MCA versus substrate. Protein concentration was assayed by bicinchoninic acid protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard (14Wiechelman K. Braun R. Fitzpatrick J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). r-NP and brain NP in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.4) were mixed with [3H]DFP (222 Bq/mmol) and incubated at 37 °C for 10 h. Nonspecific binding of [3H]DFP was removed by addition of 2 μl of cold 5.4 m DFP and 10 μl of bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and washing with ice-cold acetone (100%). The samples were precipitated at 12,000 × g for 15 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The polyacrylamide gel was fixed with distilled water:isopropyl alcohol:acetate (65:25:10) and exposed to Fuji x-ray film for 3 days. All fractionation steps in Fig. 7 A were carried out at 4 °C. The tissue extraction procedure followed that of Yen et al. (15Yen S.-H. Kenessey A. Lee S.C. Dickson D.W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2577-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The hippocampi and the cerebrums from 12 ddY mice were homogenized with 12 ml of ice-cold Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl), incubated for 15 min, and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was referred to as 0.15m NaCl-soluble fraction (A). The pellet was rehomogenized with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2% Triton X-100, incubated for 10 min, and then ultracentrifuged at 102,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was referred to as Triton X-100 soluble fraction (B). The pellet was further rehomogenized with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, incubated for 10 min, and ultracentrifuged at 208,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was referred to as Triton X-100 soluble fraction (C). The pellet was further rehomogenized with an equal volume of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 0.5m NaCl, incubated for 10 min, and then ultracentrifuged at 383,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was referred to as cytoskeleton-rich fraction (D). Each fraction was then immunoprecipitated with anti-NP antibody (mAbB5) and immunoblotted with anti-NP polyclonal rabbit antiserum. SDS-PAGE was performed as described above. The full murine NP sequence was subcloned into the NotI site of the pVL1392 transfer vector (Fig. 1 A) (8Chen Z.-L. Yoshida S. Kato K. Momota Y. Suzuki J. Tanaka T. Ito J. Nishino H. Aimoto S. Kiyama H. Shiosaka S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5088-5097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By SDS-PAGE and silver staining, a major 32-kDa product was detected in the medium derived from infected cells (Fig. 1, B and C) but not from uninfected cells (data not shown). The 32-kDa protein was immunoreactive with anti-NP monoclonal antibody (mAbB5) on Western blotting, and this band was therefore presumed to correspond to recombinant NP protein. However, conditioned media from infected and non-infected insect cells both lacked amidolytic activity for various synthetic substrates (Table I). Therefore, we speculated that the 32-kDa protein is a non-active prototype NP protein (r-pro-NP). Conditioned medium from infected insect cells showed high amidolytic activity following the endoprotease processing (fluorescence intensity was 5130 per 1 μl of medium; see details below; see also Figs. 1 B and 2 and Table I), whereas the medium from non-infected cells still showed very low amidolytic activity even after endoprotease treatment (60.3 fluorescence intensity per 1 μl of medium). The culture medium derived from infected insect cells was subjected to anion exchange chromatography in one step to purify r-pro-NP. One major peak of protein eluted by a linear NaCl gradient was collected. As the fractions contained minor cell products, they were pooled and concentrated before being applied to gel chromatography in the second step to remove the minor components. The fractions eluted from gel chromatography were used for assay of amidolytic activity after activation by gel-immobilized protease 1 (Fig. 1 B,cf. Fig. 2). A single peak of cleavage activity of Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA was observed infractions 17–20 (Fig. 1 B). To check the purity, SDS-PAGE of the fractions was performed, and proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Fraction 19 showed a single band by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining and Western blotting with mAbB5 and was thus used as purified r-pro-NP (Fig. 1 C). Endoprotease treatment of r-pro-NP induced rapid induction of amidolytic activity by conversion to r-NP (Fig. 2). The enzyme activity in this experiment was observed using Z-Pro-Phe-Arg-MCA, whereas it was cleaved less effectively than Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA because it was not cleaved by protease 1 itself (Table I). To examine the time course of the induction of activity, various concentrations of protease 1 were incubated with purified r-pro-NP. The r-pro-NP was processed in a dose-dependent manner after 5 min of incubation with protease 1 (Fig. 2). Longer incubation resulted in the enzyme activity reaching a plateau with almost the same activity at 2, 4, and 16 ng of protease 1 (Fig. 2). No induction of the enzyme activity was observed when protease 1 was omitted (Fig. 2, open squares). Enzyme activity of r-NP was characterized using this activated recombinant protein produced by endoprotease processing of r-pro-NP. The effects of pH on r-NP amidolytic activity were examined using four different buffers as follows: acetate (pH 3.5–5.5), phosphate (pH 5.5–7.5), Tris-HCl (pH 7.0–9.0), and carbonate buffer (pH 9.0–10.0). As shown in Fig. 3, the pH optimum for the enzyme activity was around pH 8.0. To confirm that r-pro-NP is a zymogen of r-NP, we performed N-terminal amino acid sequencing of both r-pro-NP and r-NP. The sequenced N-terminal peptide of r-NP was comprised of 7 amino acids and started at Ile33, 33 amino acids downstream of the deduced amino acid sequence of the NP3 cDNA (data not shown). On the other hand, the N terminus of r-pro-NP was blocked and not sequenced. To identify the N-terminal amino acid of r-pro-NP, the difference of molecular weight between r-NP and r-pro-NP was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser/desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). MALDI-TOFMS revealed that the molecular masses of r-pro-NP and r-NP were 26.613 and 26.229 kDa, respectively, and thus r-NP was 384 daltons less than r-pro-NP. This difference was suggested to be caused by an N-terminal peptide of r-pro-NP composed of 4 amino acid residues, Gln29-Lys32 (calculatedM r = 400). Some unknown modification(s), probably cyclization, of the N-terminal Gln of r-pro-NP might have been responsible for the inability to determine its N-terminal sequence. Hydrophobicity plot analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of the NP3 cDNA showed that the peptide from Met1-Ala28 is highly hydrophobic (16Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17217) Google Scholar), and this was postulated to be the signal sequence. Therefore, we concluded that secreted r-pro-NP from infected insect cells undergoes activational processing at the Lys32-Ile33 bond as shown in the model (Fig. 4). As described above, the molecular mass of r-pro-NP was determined to be 26.6 kDa by MALDI-TOFMS analysis. This is in good agreement with the calculated molecular mass (25.5 kDa) from the amino acid content deduced from the cDNA (8Chen Z.-L. Yoshida S. Kato K. Momota Y. Suzuki J. Tanaka T. Ito J. Nishino H. Aimoto S. Kiyama H. Shiosaka S. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 5088-5097Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular mass was estimated by SDS-PAGE under reducing and non-reducing conditions as 32 (Fig. 1 C) and 26 kDa (Fig. 7 B), respectively, and by Superose 12 size exclusion chromatography at 29 kDa, suggesting that the enzyme exists as a monomer. Table I shows amidolytic activities of r-pro-NP and r-NP on various synthetic substrates. The highest amidolytic activity was observed toward Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, a substrate of α-thrombin. Boc-Phe-Ser-Arg-MCA, which is a substrate of trypsin, was also a good substrate for r-NP. The effects of various protease inhibitors on amidolytic activity of r-NP are shown in TableII. The enzyme activities measured were strongly inhibited by low molecular weight protease inhibitors that bind to His and Ser residues in the active centers of serine proteases. DFP, leupeptin, and (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl 1-fluoride belong to this group. Inhibition was also seen with benzamidine and antipain. Both pepstatin A, an aspartic protease inhibitor, and E-64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, had no or only slight effects on r-NP activity. In addition, the divalent cations Ca2+ and Mg2+and metal ion chelators had little effect on r-NP activity. Thus, NP was categorized as a serine protease and not an aspartic, cysteine, or metalloprotease.Table IIEffects of inhibitors on protease activity of r-NPInhibitorConcentrationInhibitionmm%Low molecular weight inhibitors DFP0.0150.11613810100 Leupeptin0.01750.1100 APMSF2-aAPMSF, (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl 1-fluoride.0.100.319161387 Benzamidine0.110156 Antipain0.01750.195 Chymostatin0.01450.1801085 Aprotinin0.0150.1651084 Pepstatin A0.0100.10 E-640.0100.115High molecular weight inhibitors Human α1-antitrypsin2141020 Human α1-antichymotrypsin0.47216 Trypsin inhibitor0.01 (mg/ml)00.102-a APMSF, (4-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl 1-fluoride. Open table in a new tab Classified inhibitors were applied to define the r-NP activity. Specific low molecular weight inhibitors of chymotrypsin and trypsin, chymostatin and aprotinin markedly inhibited the amidolytic activity of r-NP. However, high molecular weight inhibitors of serine proteases did not significantly inhibit the enzyme activity (Table II). Hence, NP has a similar catalytic center to trypsin and chymotrypsin, but the substrate specificity due to the structure of the active site might be very different from those of these enzymes (see “Discussion”). As the r-NP favorably cleaved Boc-Val-Pro-Arg-MCA, a synthetic substrate of α-thrombin, thrombin-like blood coagulation activity was analyzed. Although 0.1 and 0.5 units of thrombin, used as a positive control, had strong platelet aggregation activity, no activity was found in r-NP at any concentration tested (0.1, 1, and 2 units; data not shown). These results suggested that r-NP does not process thrombin receptor protein (present results and see Refs. 17Vu T.K. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughin S.R.

No or only weak proteolytic activities of r-NP against gelatin and collagen types I, III, IV, and VI were detected by zymography (data not shown). Strong proteolytic activity of r-NP was found against fibronectin, an extracellular matrix protein, which is widely distributed in the nervous system. Human plasma fibronectin is composed mainly of a 440-kDa dimer with lesser but variable amounts of lower molecular weight forms, when analyzed under non-reducing conditions (lane 1 in Fig. 5, A andB). Upon incubation with r-NP, the molecular mass of fibronectin gradually decreased from the 440-kDa dimer to 220-, 200-, and 170-kDa monomers (Fig. 5 A, lanes 2–6), although no degradation of fibronectin was induced by r-pro-NP (Fig. 5 B, lanes 2–6).

https://openalex.org/W2143183318,"A unique feature of the eukaryotic subtilisin-like proprotein convertases (SPCs) is the presence of an additional highly conserved sequence of approximately 150 residues (P domain) located immediately downstream of the catalytic domain. To study the function of this region, which is required for the production of enzymatically active convertases, we have expressed and characterized various P domain-related mutants and chimeras in HEK293 cells and α-TC1–6 cells. In a series of C-terminal truncations of PC3 (also known as PC1 or SPC3), PC3-Thr594 was identified as the shortest active form, thereby defining the functional C-terminal boundary of the P domain. Substitutions at Thr594 and nearby sites indicated that residues 592–594 are crucial for activity. Chimeric SPC proteins with interchanged P domains demonstrated dramatic changes in several properties. Compared with truncated wild-type PC3 (PC3-Asp616), both PC3/PC2Pd and PC3/FurPd had elevated activity on several synthetic substrates as well as reduced calcium ion dependence, whereas Fur/PC2Pd was only slightly decreased in activity as compared with truncated furin (Fur-Glu583). Of the three active SPC chimeras tested, all had more alkaline pH optima. When PC3/PC2Pd was expressed in α-TC1–6 cells, it accelerated the processing of proglucagon into glicentin and major proglucagon fragment and cleaved major proglucagon fragment to release GLP-1 and tGLP-1, similar to wild-type PC3. Thus, P domain exchanges generated fully active chimeric proteases in several instances but not in all (e.g. PC2/PC3Pd was inactive). The observed property changes indicate a role for the P domain in regulating the stability, calcium dependence, and pH dependence of the convertases.

Each convertase has a distinct but overlapping substrate specificity and a distinctive tissue distribution, subcellular location, and maturation process, consistent with its unique role in some aspect of proprotein processing. Well characterized examples regarding these aspects are furin (expressed ubiquitously in almost all tissues), PC3, and PC2 (both restrictedly distributed in neuroendocrine tissues). We have only a limited understanding of the structural determinants which differentiate the various SPCs from each other in their function and properties. Their basic domain structure includes (Fig. 1) a signal peptide, a partially conserved propeptide, a highly conserved catalytic domain (40–50% identity among the SPCs and 25–30% to the subtilisins) followed by a relatively well conserved region called the P, homoB, or “middle” domain. Studies in recent years have clarified the role of propeptide cleavage in furin activation and the function of the propeptide as an intramolecular inhibitor which prevents early activation (10Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). After the P domain, various C-terminal extensions occur; these extensions seem to contain mainly routing/trafficking determinants. For instance, furin is primarily located in the trans-Golgi network, anchored by its transmembrane domain, and mutations in its cytoplasmic domain result in dramatic changes in its subcellular location (11Molloy S.S. Thomas L. VanSlyke J.K. Stenberg P.E. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 18-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar, 12Dittié A.S. Thomas L. Thomas G. Tooze S.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4859-4870Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Attachment of the P domain and C-terminal region of PC2 to the catalytic domain of furin resulted in a chimera which behaved similarly to PC2 in that it was now targeted to regulated pathway vesicles (13Creemers J.W.M. Usac E.F. Bright N.A. Van de Loo J.-W. Jansen E. Van de Ven W.J.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25284-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), whereas a truncated furin without a transmembrane domain was secreted via a non-regulated (constitutive or basal) secretory pathway. Deletion of residues from the C terminus of PC3 gave a mutant (terminating at Asp616) that was secreted in increased amounts via the constitutive pathway, whereas lesser amounts were routed into regulated secretory granules in AtT-20 cells (14Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The C-terminal region after Asp616 of PC3 may also function as an inhibitor (15Jutras I. Seidah N.G. Reudelhuber T.L. Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Little is known about the function of the P domain. Due to functional differences between the subtilisins (degradative) and kexin (proteolytic processing), the conserved region after the catalytic domain of kexin was named the “P domain” when it became evident that it was required for processing activity (16Fuller R.S.

Although there are a few examples of bacterial subtilisins with extensions after the catalytic domain, a search of the protein data bank does not reveal any significant sequence similarity of the P domain with other known proteins. For both kexin and furin, a partial C-terminal deletion of the P domain, even of just a few amino acids, abolishes enzymatic activity completely (17Gluschankof P. Fuller R.S. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2280-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 18Creemers J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Roebroek A.J.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Huylebroeck D. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol.

Schalich J. Heinz F.X. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8475-8481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic analysis demonstrated that the lack of activity was due to two mutations within the P domain coding region of the furin gene, one resulting in a frameshift (20Takahashi S. Kasai K. Hatsuzawa K. Kitamura N. Misumi Y. Ikehara Y. Murakami K. Nakayama K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 195: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and the other in a replacement of a conserved tryptophan with arginine (21Takahashi S. Nakagawa T. Kasai K. Banno T.

Recently, a defect in the PC3 gene has been found in a human patient. In this case, a glycine within the P domain region is replaced by an arginine (22Jackson R.S. Creemers J.W.M. Ohagi S. Raffin-Sanson M.-L. Sanders L. Montague C.T. Hutton J.C. O'Rahilly S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 303-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar). There has been no reported systematic study to elucidate the functional role(s) of the P domain and examine its structural relation to the catalytic domain. In the present study, using PC3 as the primary model convertase, we have investigated the properties of various P domain-related mutants and chimeras expressed in endocrine and/or non-endocrine mammalian cell lines. Our findings provide evidence that in addition to stabilizing the catalytic domain, the P domain participates in the regulation of the pH and calcium dependence, as well as the substrate specificity of these enzymes. cDNA templates for rat PC3 (PC1), PC2, and PC3-Asp616 (PC1ΔC) (14Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Mains at the Johns Hopkins University; human furin template was from Dr. Kazuhisa Nakayama at the University of Tsukuba, Japan. pCMV6b/6c (b and c: identical except in the orientation of the polylinker region) vectors were from Dr. Graeme Bell at the University of Chicago. Unless stated otherwise, all mutants were generated by creating mutation-containing fragments by polymerase chain reaction and subcloning the polymerase chain reaction fragments into expression vectors by restriction digestion and ligation. All polymerase chain reaction-generated fragments were verified by sequencing. The orientation of subcloned fragments was verified by restriction digestion. Fig. 1 illustrates a schematic summary of the mutants used in this study. Three truncation mutants, PC3-His592, PC3-Gly593, and PC3-Thr594, terminating at amino acid His592, Gly593, and Thr594, were created by adding a stop code and a restriction site immediately after the desired amino acid, respectively. In the substitution study, Thr594 in mutant PC3-Thr594 was replaced with serine, aspartic acid, and asparagine, respectively (mutants PC3-T594S/T594D/T594N). Mutant PC3-H592T was generated by replacing His592 in PC3-His592 with threonine. Three chimeric proteins, PC3/PC2Pd, PC2/PC3Pd, and PC3/FurPd, were generated by using the “gene splicing by overlap extension” (SOE) technique (23Horton R.M. Cai Z. Ho S.N. Pease L.R. Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 528-535Google Scholar). PC3/PC2Pd was created by fusing amino acids 1–453 of PC3 with amino acids 456–638 of PC2. PC2/PC3Pd was a fusion protein with amino acids 1–455 of PC2 and amino acids 454–616 of PC3. Mutant PC3/FurPd consists of amino acids 1–453 of PC3 and amino acids 440–583 of furin. Mutant Fur/PC2Pd (18Creemers J.W.M. Siezen R.J. Roebroek A.J.M. Ayoubi T.A.Y. Huylebroeck D. Van de Ven W.J.M. J. Biol.

All mutants and wild-type control SPCs were cloned into either the pCMV6b or pCMV6c vector for expression in mammalian cells. HEK293 cells (human embryonic kidney tumor cells) and α-TC1–6 cells (mouse pancreatic alpha cells) were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). SPC mutant vectors were transiently transfected into HEK293 cells using the calcium phosphate method (Profection kit, Promega). When stable transfection was desired, as indicated under “Results,” cells were transfected using the Lipofectin method. Plasmid pSV2neo was co-transfected with the SPC mutant-carrying vectors to provide drug resistance. Transfected cells were then cultured in G418-containing medium (0.5 mg/ml); G418-resistant colonies were screened for the expression of interested SPC protein by biosynthetic labeling/immunoprecipitation, Western blotting, or immunofluorescence staining. Processing of transfected SPC protein was characterized by biosynthetic labeling. For transiently transfected cells, the labeling was performed 48 h after transfection. Briefly, cells were first incubated in methionine-deficient media for 30 min and then pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine (1 mCi/ml, 1000 Ci/mmol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with or without a subsequent chase incubation in nonradioactive complete media. Upon termination of incubation, media were collected, and cellular proteins were extracted with a TES buffer containing 20 mm TES, pH 7.4, 10 mm mannitol, and 1% Triton X-100 (24Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoprecipitation, samples were diluted with an immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.02% NaN3) (25Melnick J. Aviel S. Argon Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21303-21306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Appropriate antibodies (as specified under “Results”) and protein A (for polyclonal antibodies) or protein G (for monoclonal antibodies) (Pierce) were added. Protease inhibitors (26Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 737-745Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were present through the sample collection and immunoprecipitation procedures. Immunoprecipitated SPC proteins were fractionated on SDS-PAGE slab gels (7.5% or 10%) and detected by fluorography. HEK293 cells expressing various SPCs were incubated in complete serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 15–20 h. Collected medium was concentrated 20–30-fold using a 30K Ultrafree concentrating unit (Millipore Corp.). Enzymatic activity assays followed the protocol described by Vindrola and Lindberg (27Vindrola O. Lindberg I. Neuropeptides. 1993; 25: 151-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA as the substrate. In the substrate specificity assay, Boc-Arg-Val-Arg-Arg-MCA, Boc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA and Boc-Ala-Gly-Pro-Arg-MCA (where Boc is t-butoxycarbonyl) were the test substrates used (Peninsula Laboratories). In experiments aimed at comparing the activity levels of various SPC chimeras, cells were cultured in duplicate plates with equal cell numbers. One plate was used to collect medium and analyze its activity. Cells in the second plate were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 h and then chase incubated in non-radioactive complete serum-free medium for 4–6 h. Media from the second plates of various cell lines were collected, immunoprecipitated with appropriate SPC antibodies, and subjected to SDS-PAGE slab gel analysis. Upon loading the SDS-PAGE gel, each sample was mixed with non-radioactive rainbow molecular weight markers. Fractionated samples were electrically blotted onto Immobolin-P membrane (Millipore); blot areas corresponding to the appropriate molecular weight range of the processed SPCs were excised, treated with a stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, 2% SDS, 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.7) at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by scintillation counting. Preliminary tests established that loaded radioactivity could be quantitatively recovered by this procedure. Based on the radioactivity recovered from each immunoprecipitation/SDS-PAGE, after correction for the number of methionine residues in each SPC protein, the amount of medium collected from the duplicate plate used for assay of activity was adjusted so that equimolar amounts of SPC were used in each activity assay. Wild-type or transfected α-TC1–6 cells were labeled with either [35S]methionine, as described above, or [3H]leucine (0.4 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cellular protein extraction and immunoprecipitation were performed as described previously (28Rouillé Y. Westermark G. Martin S.K. Steiner D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3242-3246Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies (see “Results”), [35S]methionine-labeled samples were fractionated on a gradient SDS-PAGE slab gel; [3H]leucine-labeled samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE tube gels. Tube gels were sliced and eluted (29Zhou A. Bloomquist B.T. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1763-1769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by scintillation counting. Non-radioactive rainbow molecular weight markers were added with samples as internal standards. Among the known mammalian SPCs, PC3-Asp616, which migrated as a 67-kDa species in the present study (Fig. 2), is the shortest active form. It is normally produced in neuroendocrine cells after the autocatalytic removal of the propeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent deletion of a C-terminal fragment (amino acids 617–736) in the secretory granules (14Zhou A. Paquet L. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21509-21516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 30Zhou Y. Rovere C. Kitabgi P. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24702-24706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Non-endocrine cells usually do not endogenously express PC3. Its relative simplicity, selective distribution, and our greater understanding of its maturation process and function make this truncated form of PC3 an ideal model convertase for studies on the P domain. Of the mammalian P domains, the last two conserved amino acids in the C-terminal region, presumably marking their junction with the C-terminal extensions, are Gly593 and Thr594(numbers are for rat PC3). PC3-Asp616 contains an additional 22 amino acids beyond this conserved region. To define more precisely the shortest sequence needed for activity, three truncation mutants ending at or near these conserved amino acids were expressed in HEK293 cells. Their propeptide cleavage activity and secretion were examined by a pulse-chase metabolic labeling paradigm (Fig. 2). PC3-Asp616 undergoes very efficient autocatalytic cleavage to remove its propeptide. During a 30-min pulse-labeling period, the majority of 75-kDa pro-PC3-Asp616 was converted to 67-kDa mature PC3, and most of the latter was secreted into medium during the subsequent 3-h chase incubation. For truncation mutant PC3-Thr594 (Fig. 2, right), the dominant form during the 30-min pulse was a molecule slightly smaller than 75 kDa. Later, it was processed into a 65-kDa protein, an expected size for this truncated PC3 after removal of its propeptide. The conversion rate of pro-PC3-Thr594 to PC3-Thr594 was not as efficient as that of pro-PC3-Asp616 to PC3-Asp616, but after 3 h of chase incubation, a significant amount of the processed PC3-Thr594 was secreted into the medium. In contrast, neither PC3-Gly593 (Fig. 2,middle) nor PC3-His592 (data not shown) was processed or secreted. To determine whether the lack of propeptide cleavage in PC3-Gly593 and PC3-His592 was due to the absence of threonine at the C terminus of the P domain, Thr594 in PC3-Thr594 was replaced with serine, aspartic acid, or asparagine, respectively. Fig. 3 shows a biosynthetic labeling experiment on HEK293 cells expressing PC3-T594S, T594D, and T594N. After a 30-min pulse and a 3-h chase incubation, a small amount of mature 65-kDa protein was seen in the media of cells expressing PC3-T594S and PC3-T594N, whereas it was not visible with mutant PC3-T594D. For mutant PC3-H592T, in which His592 in the PC3-His592 mutant was replaced with threonine, there was no detectable propeptide cleavage activity. These results thus demonstrated that the shortest form of PC3 capable of cleaving its propeptide is PC3-Thr594. The few conserved amino acids at the C terminus of the P domain region (His592, Gly593, and Thr594) also seem to play a crucial role in sustaining the autocatalytic activity of PC3. This also confirmed that the P domain of PC3 has a C-terminal well defined boundary. The relatively high level of conservation of the P domains among various SPCs suggests that these domains must play some essential role. We therefore reasoned that interchanges of P domains might provide information on these possible function(s). Accordingly, P domain-swapped SPCs were prepared and transfected into HEK293 cells (Fig. 1). The autocatalytic activation of each chimeric form was studied by pulse-chase metabolic labeling, and its processing and secretion were compared with that of the parental proteases. PC3/PC2Pd was initially synthesized as a 79-kDa protein, which was then converted into a 69-kDa protein through an intermediate (Fig. 4, top panel). The conversion rate was slower than that of the propeptide processing of PC3-Asp616. The secretion of 69-kDa PC3/PC2Pd protein, however, was as efficient as the secretion of PC3-Asp616. The counterpart mutant, PC2/PC3Pd, did not show any propeptide cleavage activity (Fig. 4, bottom panel), even when 7B2 (a unique PC2 helper protein) (31Muller L. Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 625-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 32Benjannet S. Savaria D. Chrétien M. Seidah N.G. J.

Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) was co-expressed and the chase incubation was extended to 8 h (data not shown). Mutant PC3/FurPd also displayed propeptide cleavage activity, although it was much less efficient than that of PC3-Asp616, and the secretion of the processed form was relatively slow (Fig. 4,middle panel). The presence of two forms in the cells after a 3-hour chase presumably represents differences in glycosylation status. During the course of this study, Creemers et al.(13Creemers J.W.M. Usac E.F. Bright N.A. Van de Loo J.-W. Jansen E. Van de Ven W.J.M. Hutton J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25284-25291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) reported that, in their study on the sorting mechanisms of SPCs, a chimeric protein with the catalytic domain of furin and the P domain of PC2 underwent efficient propeptide cleavage and secretion via the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. When we expressed this mutant in HEK293 cells, it also showed efficient propeptide cleavage and secretion, similar to that of Fur-Glu583 (data not shown). The successful propeptide cleavage and secretion of the chimeric SPCs suggested that they were able to fold and be transported in HEK293 cells. Next we attempted to determine whether these chimeric enzymes were active in cleaving substrates. Our preliminary experiments established that wild-type HEK293 cells in our culture system secrete negligible amounts of endoproteolytic activity toward MCA-linked synthetic substrates, as tested over a range of pH values and varying calcium ion concentrations. Collected media samples from HEK293 cells expressing various SPC mutants and wild-type SPCs were analyzed for their activities against fluorogenic substrates. PC3/PC2Pd, PC3/FurPd, and Fur/PC2Pd were all active (see below). Three major enzymatic properties that distinguish eukaryotic SPCs from bacterial subtilisins are their dependence on calcium for activation and activity, their more acidic pH optima, and their requirement of two or more basic amino acids at the substrate cleavage site. Efforts were made to address each of these properties in the mutants. We first tested the calcium dependence of the active chimeras. Between 0 and 20 mmcalcium ion concentration, PC3-Asp616 showed a gradual increase of activity. The activity level plateaued above 20 mm calcium ion concentration. Omitting calcium and adding 2 mm EGTA or 2 mm EDTA to the assay completely suppressed the activity of PC3-Asp616 (Fig. 5, top panel). Quite strikingly, PC3/PC2Pd retained 40–55% of its activity in the presence of EGTA or EDTA, and its activity increased only moderately over the range from 0 to 40 mm calcium ion concentration. PC3/FurPd (Fig. 5, top panel), on the other hand, had little activity in the presence of EGTA or EDTA. It gained most of its activity in the lower range of calcium concentration (0–5 mm). The activity of Fur/PC2Pd responded to the changes in calcium ion concentration in a pattern similar to that of Fur-Glu583(Fig. 5, bottom panel), i.e. no activity in the presence of EGTA or EDTA and gaining most of the activity in the low range of calcium ion concentrations. Full-size PC3 and C-terminally processed PC3 have different acidic pH optima (34Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18408-18413Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Coates L.C. Birch N.P. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 828-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Similar to other published results, PC3-Asp616 secreted from HEK293 cells showed maximal activity at pH 6.0 within a narrow range (Fig. 6, top panel). Fur-Glu583 had a broader optimum pH, ranging between pH 7 and pH 8 (Fig. 6, bottom panel). The optimum pH for PC3/PC2Pd was shifted to between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0 (Fig. 6, top panel). The optimum pH for PC3/FurPd was pH 7.0 (Fig. 6, top panel), in between that of Fur-Glu583 and PC3-Asp616. Fur/PC2Pd demonstrated a more alkaline and narrower optimum pH (pH 8.0) than was observed for Fur-Glu583 (Fig. 6, bottom panel). Taken together, all three chimeric SPC proteins had more alkaline pH optima than their parental wild types. The activity levels of various SPC chimeras with fluorogenic substrates were compared at their optimum pH and with 10 mm calcium (Table I, top). The specific activities of PC3/PC2Pd and PC3/FurPd were 3–4-fold higher than the activity of PC3-Asp616, respectively, whereas the activity of Fur/PC2Pd was slightly lower than the activity of Fur-Glu583. PC3-Thr594 had a level of activity similar to that of PC3-Asp616 (data not shown); PC3-T594S and PC3-T594N, although secreted in minor amounts, did not show any detectable enzymatic activity"

An estimated 200 million people throughout tropical and temperate regions of the world are infected with parasitic trematodes of the genus Schistosoma (1World Health Organization The Control of Schistosomiasis.

These parasites possess complex life cycles, using humans and other mammals as definitive hosts, while various species of aquatic snails serve as intermediate hosts for larval stages. After infection of the definitive host by infectious stage cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni, the immature parasites undergo a complex program of development to become sexually mature adult males and females at approximately 6 weeks post-infection. During development, the parasites migrate from their point of entry in the skin to the circulatory system and then pass via the heart and lungs to their final destination in the mesenteric veins of the hepatic portal circulation. The severe hepatic and intestinal pathology associated with schistosomiasis is caused by the vigorous host immune response to large quantities of schistosome eggs produced by pairs of adult parasites residing in the mesenteric veins. Previous studies have suggested that successful completion of schistosome development and migration is dependent on the receipt of appropriate host-derived signals by the parasite, and on transmission of signals between male and female parasites (2Amiri P.

Parasitol. 1987; 73: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Since the schistosome surface is composed of a continuous cytoplasmic tegument bound externally by a lipid bilayer, we hypothesized that schistosomes may possess surface-exposed, membrane-bound receptor proteins that allow signals in the surrounding milieu to be detected. To test this hypothesis, we developed a procedure to specifically label surface proteins expressed on the outer membrane of the parasite tegument using a polar, water-soluble form of biotin (6Davies S.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Parasite surface proteins could then be isolated from solubilized tegument membranes using a streptavidin affinity matrix and analyzed for potential receptor molecules. As an initial screen for receptor-like proteins, we analyzed purified parasite surface molecules for the presence of protein kinase activity, since many cell-surface receptors are known to possess intrinsic kinase activity, e.g. members of the receptor tyrosine kinase family. Using this approach, we observed that a protein kinase activity specific for serine and threonine residues copurified with schistosome surface proteins (6Davies S.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The susceptibility of the kinase to biotinylation indicated that it must be exposed at the parasite surface, while the presence of a kinase domain suggested that the protein may span the parasite surface membrane, since protein kinase domains are usually intracellular. Subsequent studies using Triton X-114 to phase-separate purified surface molecules into detergent and aqueous phases have found that the surface-associated kinase partitions into the detergent phase, 1E. Racoosin and E. J. Pearce, unpublished data. adding weight to the conclusion that it is an integral membrane protein. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that the surface-associated kinase may be a schistosome member of the receptor serine-threonine kinase (RSTK) 2The abbreviations used are: RSTK, receptor serine-threonine kinase; SmRK-1, S. mansoni receptor kinase-1; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Ig, immunoglobulin; CaBP, calcium-binding protein; bp, base pair(s). family of proteins, since RSTKs are the only transmembrane proteins known to possess intrinsic serine-threonine kinase activity (7Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). The RSTKs constitute a large family of cell-surface receptors, with examples now identified in widely divergent taxa of metazoa, includingCaenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, and various vertebrates (7Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Members of the RSTK family can be further classified as either type I or type II receptors based on structural and functional characteristics. Mammalian members of this family include the type I and type II receptors for growth factors such as transforming growth factor β, the activins and inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins, and other factors that play prominent roles in growth and development. To test our hypothesis that a RSTK may be expressed on the schistosome surface membrane, we attempted to clone and characterize schistosome members of this protein family. Here we report the identification of a schistosome RSTK ( S. m ansoni ReceptorKinase-1, or SmRK-1) which is expressed on the parasite surface and which may be responsible, at least in part, for the serine-threonine kinase activity associated with the parasite surface membrane. Biomphalaria glabrata snails infected with S. mansoni (NMRI strain) sporocysts were obtained from Biomedical Research Institute (Bethesda, MD). Cercariae were obtained by exposing infected snails to illumination in a 30 °C water bath for 1 h. Schistosomula were obtained by in vitrotransformation of cercariae as described previously (8Lazdins J.K. Stein M.J. David J.R. Sher A. Exp. Parasitol. 1982; 53: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Adult parasites were recovered from female C57BL/6J mice (Taconic Farms) infected with cercariae 6 weeks (or more) previously using the ring method (9Smithers S.R. Terry R.J. Parasitology. 1965; 55: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from adult S. mansoni parasites using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Inc.) and first-strand cDNA synthesis performed using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and an oligo(dT)12–18 primer. A pair of degenerate primers (forward primer: 5′-AAACCAGCTATTGCTCAYMGNGA-3′; reverse primer: 5′-TCTGGAGCCATATAACGTTTTGTNCCNAC-3′; corresponding to conserved sequences from subdomains VIB and VIII of other RSTK kinase domains, respectively) was used to amplify schistosome RSTK sequences from parasite cDNA by PCR. PCR products were cloned into the pCRII vector (Invitrogen), sequenced, and used to isolate a larger cDNA fragment from an adult male S. mansoni cDNA library constructed in λgt11 (10Shoemaker C.B. Ramachandran H. Landa A. dos Reis M.G. Stein L.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 53: 17-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Phage forward and reverse primers were used in combination with internal primers to amplify the cDNA insert as two overlapping fragments from the recombinant phage. These fragments were cloned into pCRII and sequenced. Additional 5′ sequence was isolated using 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. DNA sequencing was performed using dye terminator chemistry and a 373A sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc.). Sequence analysis was performed using LASERGENE (DNASTAR Inc.). For phylogenetic analyses, the SmRK-1 kinase domain sequence was aligned with those of other RSTK kinase domains using the Clustal function of the Megalign program (DNASTAR Inc.). The Protdist program from the PHYLIP package (11Felsenstein J. Cladistics. 1989; 5: 164-166Google Scholar) was used to compute distance measures for the sequences using the Dayhoff PAM matrix, and an unrooted tree was generated using the Neighbor-Joining algorithm (Neighbor program, PHYLIP). Genomic DNA was isolated from cercariae using standard procedures. Following digestion with restriction enzymes and electrophoresis, DNA was transferred to nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) and hybridized to a 1.4-kilobase fragment of the SmRK-1 cDNA labeled with [α-32P]dATP (Amersham) by the random primer method. Bound probe was detected by autoradiography. A DNA fragment encoding most of the intracellular portion of the SmRK-1 protein (amino acids Met259–His594) was amplified using primers that incorporated a prokaryotic ribosome-binding site (12Gold L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 199-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) and a 6-histidine tag at the N and C termini, respectively. The PCR product was cloned into pCRII and modifications were confirmed by sequencing before subcloning into the prokaryotic expression vector pKK223-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The His-tagged cytoplasmic domain of SmRK-1 was then overexpressed in Escherichia coli Top10F′ cells (Invitrogen) and purified under denaturing conditions (8m urea) on a Ni-NTA-agarose column (Qiagen). Recombinant protein was dialyzed extensively against phosphate-buffered saline and used to raise polyclonal anti-SmRK-1 antisera in mice and rabbits. Freshly recovered adult S. mansoni were surface-labeled with a polar, water-soluble form of biotin that does not cross lipid bilayers, as described previously (6Davies S.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were incubated in a 0.5 mg ml−1 solution of sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Sulfo-NHS-Biotin, Pierce), dissolved in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (DPBS+), for 30 min at 4 °C. After removal of the biotin solution, the parasites were washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium to quench remaining biotin, and three times with DPBS+ prior to extraction. Parasites were metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine as described previously (6Davies S.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Briefly, freshly recovered S. mansoni were incubated for 6 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (minus methionine and cystine), 10 mm HEPES, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 μg ml−1pyruvate, 150 μg ml−1 oxaloacetate, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, 100 μg ml−1 streptomycin (worm culture medium), containing 500 μCi ml−1 [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN). Labeling of parasite proteins with [32P]phosphate was achieved by incubating freshly recovered adult S. mansoni in phosphate-free worm culture medium containing 667 μCi ml−1 [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products Inc.) for 3 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Unincorporated radioactivity was removed by extensive washing of parasites before protein extracts were prepared. Following surface labeling or metabolic radiolabeling, parasite surface membranes and the underlying tegumental cytoplasm were solubilized by gently incubating whole parasites in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 μg ml−1aprotinin, 0.5 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 5 μg ml−1 pepstatin A, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 30 min on ice, after which the supernatant was removed as the “tegument extract.” The phosphatase inhibitors sodium fluoride (10 mm) and Na3VO4 (1 mm) were also included in the lysis buffer when preparing extracts from [32P]orthophosphate-labeled worms. The remains of the parasites were then homogenized in a further volume of lysis buffer, incubated on ice for 30 min, and microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 15 min, the resulting supernatant being called the “carcass extract.” The protein concentration of parasite extracts was determined using the Protein-Gold Assay Reagent (Integrated Separation Systems). To perform immunoprecipitations from parasite extracts, samples were first precleared by incubating with 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 5 μl of preimmune serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared supernatants were incubated for 2–12 h with 5 μl of antiserum at 4 °C. 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads were then added and incubation continued for a further 1 h to collect immune complexes. Beads were pelleted in a microcentrifuge and washed 5 times with lysis buffer. Bound immune complexes were then eluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 2.5% 2-mercaptoethanol at 100 °C for 5 min and analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, followed by immunoblotting, fluorography, or autoradiography. For immunoblotting, mouse and rabbit anti-SmRK-1 antisera were used at a dilution of 1:1000 and detected with peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit Ig G (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted to 1:5000. For detection of biotinylated proteins on blots, membranes were incubated in 0.1 μg ml−1 peroxidase-labeled streptavidin (Kirkegaard & Perry), 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 for 25 min at room temperature. Antibody- and streptavidin-peroxidase conjugates bound to blots were detected using ECL Detection Reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Whole-mount adult schistosomes were prepared for confocal microscopy as described by Brownlee et al. (13Brownlee D.J. Fairweather I. Johnston C.F. Thorndyke M.C. Skuce P.J. Parasitology. 1995; 110: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Briefly, parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 4 h a 4 °C, and then washed in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine albumin, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaN3 (PBT) for 24 h at 4 °C. Parasites were then incubated with rabbit anti-SmRK-1 antiserum diluted 1:500 in PBT for 72 h at 4 °C, washed in PBT for 24 h at 4 °C, and incubated with rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) diluted 1:250 in PBT for 24 h at 4 °C. After a final 24-h wash in PBT at 4 °C, parasites were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) on hanging-drop slides and viewed with a MRC-500 confocal scanning laser microscope (Bio-Rad). To visualize surface-bound host Ig, fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG+IgM (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc.) was included at a dilution of 1:250 during the secondary antibody incubation. Total RNA was isolated and cDNA synthesis performed as described above. To detect SmRK-1 transcripts, the forward primer 5′-TCTGAAGTCTAGAAACATCTTAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GATCTGAGTTTGAATTAACTTC-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides 1314 to 1336 and 1414 to 1435 of the SmRK-1 cDNA sequence, respectively) were used to amplify a 121-bp segment of the SmRK-1 cDNA sequence. As a control, a 230-bp segment of the message for a S. mansonicalcium-binding protein (CaBP) which is preferentially expressed in larval stages (14Ram D. Grossman Z. Markovics A. Avivi A. Ziv E. Lantner F. Schechter I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 34: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was amplified using the forward primer 5′-TTTCACTGTATTGCATTAGAATGG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTATGAACATAAAACATCAAGGAG-3′ (corresponding to nucleotides −20 to +4 and +278 to +301 of the CaBP genomic sequence). PCR with degenerate primers based on conserved amino acid sequences from kinase domains of other RSTKs resulted in the amplification of a single 176-bp sequence from adult schistosome cDNA. Cloning and sequence analysis revealed that the fragment contained part of an open reading frame and that the predicted translation product showed considerable amino acid identity to comparable regions of other RSTKs, suggesting that the sequence was indeed derived from a novel schistosome RSTK. After confirming by PCR that the sequence was present in adult male S. mansoni cDNA (data not shown), the fragment was used as a probe to screen an adult male S. mansoni cDNA library. A screen of 1.2 × 105 plaques resulted in the identification of a single positive recombinant phage containing a 3.9-kilobase insert. The cDNA was sequenced and found to contain a single open reading frame of 1782 bases beginning with an ATG codon 19 nucleotides downstream of the 5′ end, and a long 3′-untranslated region terminating in a poly(A) tail of 27 residues. Since the initiator ATG codon was not in the context of a Kozak consensus sequence (15Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar) and the 18 nucleotides of sequence upstream remained open, an additional 250 bp of 5′ sequence was isolated by 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (data not shown). However, no other potential initiator ATG codons were detected in the additional 5′ sequence and an in-frame stop codon occurred 45 nucleotides 5′ of the first ATG, leading us to conclude that the entire open reading frame was contained within the initial cDNA isolate. This open reading frame encodes a 594-amino acid protein we call SmRK-1. The predicted amino acid sequence of SmRK-1 is shown in Fig. 1, panel A. Hydrophobicity analysis using the Kyte-Doolittle method (16Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17215) Google Scholar) revealed two hydrophobic segments: one at the N terminus and another between residues 137–158. The N-terminal region could constitute a short signal peptide (17von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1535) Google Scholar) with potential signal peptidase cleavage sites after residues 13 or 16 (18von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar), while the region between residues 137 and 158 may represent a transmembrane domain (Fig. 1, panel A). The predicted molecular mass of the entire SmRK-1 polypeptide is 66.3 kilodaltons (kDa). Removal of the signal peptide would result in a predicted 1.4–1.7 kDa reduction in molecular mass, resulting in a mature SmRK-1 protein of 64.6–64.9 kDa. There is one potential N-linked glycosylation site (Asn12) in the N-terminal part of the protein, which would presumably be removed from the mature receptor with the signal peptide. There are also 12 cysteine residues in the putative extracellular region, 10 of which would be present in the mature protein (Fig. 1, panel A). The three cysteines closest to the transmembrane domain (residues 107, 108, and 113), together with Asn114, constitute a “cysteine box,” a motif characteristic of RSTK family members, defined by the consensus sequence C2–3X4–5CN (7Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that the N-terminal part of the protein represents the extracellular ligand-binding domain of SmRK-1. A putative serine-threonine protein kinase domain is located C-terminal to the transmembrane domain between residues 309 and 594, as indicated by the presence of a putative ATP-binding site at residues 309–331 and a putative serine-threonine kinase active site at residues 421–440 (Fig. 1, panel A). When a data base search was performed using the SmRK-1 protein sequence, a high degree of similarity (up to 58% identity) to RSTKs of the type I subfamily was found. Significant levels of amino acid identity were restricted to the kinase domain, with little similarity to other proteins detected elsewhere in the sequence. Type II RSTKs were less similar, showing approximately 40% identity over the kinase domain. The similarity between SmRK-1 and other type I RSTKs is also reflected by the lack of a cytoplasmic tail downstream of the kinase domain of SmRK-1, a typical feature of type I receptors (7Massague J. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 172-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analysis of the SmRK-1 kinase domain sequence further demonstrated its overall similarity to type I receptors but also confirmed its divergent nature, indicating that it is not orthologous to any other currently known RSTKs (Fig. 1,panel B). Type I RSTKs are further distinguished from type II receptors by the presence of a “GS domain,” a 30-amino acid glycine- and serine-rich region immediately upstream of the kinase domain that functions in regulation of receptor kinase activity (19Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). This domain contains the core sequence hy2–3GSGSG (where hy represents either of the hydroxyamino acids serine or threonine), plus 1–2 additional downstream threonines, which are conserved in all type I receptors. While elements of this domain are evident in SmRK-1, the core sequence contains two substitutions (SmRK-1 residues T284CSGLGSG, substitutions in bold) and therefore resembles the comparable region of the C. elegans Daf-1 receptor (core sequence T273SGSGMG, substitution in bold), a divergent member of the RSTK family which defies classification at present (20Georgi L.L. Albert P.S. Riddle D.L. Cell. 1990; 61: 635-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). To confirm the parasite origin of the SmRK-1 sequence and examine its genomic organization, a 1.4-kilobase fragment of the SmRK-1 cDNA was used as a probe in Southern analysis of S. mansoni genomic DNA isolated from free-living cercarial stages (Fig. 2). Single bands were obtained when probe was hybridized under stringent conditions to cercarial genomic DNA digested with EcoRI and HindIII, confirming that the SmRK-1 cDNA is of schistosome origin and was not inadvertently isolated from contaminating mouse host tissue. These data also suggested that the SmRK-1 gene is represented by a single copy in theS. mansoni genome. Two bands were obtained when probe was hybridized to genomic DNA digested with ClaI, and this is consistent with our observation that a ClaI site is located in the 3′-untranslated region of the SmRK-1 cDNA. To further confirm the parasite origin of SmRK-1, anti-SmRK-1 antibodies were generated against the cytoplasmic portion of the molecule and used to immunoprecipitate SmRK-1 from extracts of adult schistosomes metabolically radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Fig. 3). A radiolabeled polypeptide with a calculated molecular mass of 65 kDa was immunoprecipitated by these antibodies from tegument and carcass extracts, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of SmRK-1 minus the signal peptide. This result confirmed that SmRK-1 is a parasite protein and not derived from host tissue. To determine if SmRK-1 is expressed on the parasite surface and could therefore contribute to the surface-associated kinase activity, we examined whether native, parasite-expressed SmRK-1 was susceptible to selective surface labeling of parasite proteins. We have previously shown that the water-soluble, membrane-impermeable probe sulfosuccinimidobiotin can be used to selectively and specifically biotinylate the surface proteins of adult schistosomes (6Davies S.J. Pearce E.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1995; 70: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). When freshly isolated adult schistosomes were subjected to surface labeling, SmRK-1 could be immunoprecipitated in a biotinylated form from extracts of these parasites, indicating that the receptor is expressed on the schistosome surface (Fig. 4). To further examine the distribution of SmRK-1 expression at the schistosome surface, whole adult parasites were fixed and probed with anti-SmRK-1 antibodies. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal scanning laser microscopy were used to observe anti-SmRK-1 antibody binding to whole-mount parasites. A punctate pattern of staining was observed on the anterior dorsal surfaces of male schistosomes (Fig. 5, panels A and C). These foci of immunofluorescence correspond to the tubercles on the dorsal surfaces of male parasites. A similar pattern of fluorescence was observed when frozen sections of adult parasites were probed with anti-SmRK-1 antibodies (data not shown). SmRK-1 expression could not be detected in other regions of male parasites or in female parasites, suggesting that SmRK-1 is preferentially expressed on the surface membranes of males. Host Ig bound to the surfaces of adult schistosomes was visualized simultaneously as a marker for the parasite surface (Fig. 5, panels B and C), since host antibodies become bound to the surface of adult parasites during infection (21Sogandares-Bernal F. J. Parasitol. 1976; 62: 222-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar,22Gearner G.W. Kemp W.M. J. Parasitol. 1994; 80: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Host Ig was observed in the same focal plane as SmRK-1 staining, providing further evidence that SmRK-1 is expressed at the parasite surface. To examine the possibility that SmRK-1 may participate in a signaling mechanism within the schistosome tegument, we assessed whether native SmRK-1 is phosphorylated in intact parasites. Freshly recovered adult schistosomes were incubated in medium containing [32P]orthophosphate to label parasite phosphoproteins and SmRK-1 was immunoprecipitated from tegument extracts of these parasites (Fig. 6). SmRK-1 was immunoprecipitated in a phosphorylated form, suggesting that it participates in a protein kinase cascade and may therefore be active in a signaling mechanism. Several other phosphoproteins were also detected in anti-SmRK-1 immunoprecipitates that were absent in the preimmune serum precipitates. The possibility that these species represent specifically co-precipitating molecules that interact with SmRK-1 is currently being addressed. Immunoblot analysis of extracts from various life cycle stages was performed using anti-SmRK-1 antibodies to determine whether stage-specific regulation of SmRK-1 expression occurred during the parasite life cycle (Fig. 7). SmRK-1 expression was detected from 21 days postinfection of the mammalian host onwards, but not in eggs or larval stages. A monoclonal antibody specific for paramyosin, a protein found in the tegument cytoplasm, was used as a control for protein loading in each lane. These data correlate with those obtained using a reverse transcriptase-PCR assay for SmRK-1 transcripts (Fig. 7). SmRK-1 message was readily detected in adult RNA but not in RNA from 3-h-old schistosomula. In contrast, message for a schistosome CaBP which is expressed in cercariae and early schistosomula (14Ram D. Grossman Z. Markovics A. Avivi A. Ziv E. Lantner F. Schechter I. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1989; 34: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was readily detected in RNA from 3-h schistosomula, while only a weak signal could be amplified from adult RNA. In comparison to pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and protozoa, a distinguishing feature of helminth infections is the aggregated distribution of infections observed in affected populations, where a minority of individuals are found to harbor the majority of parasites (23Maizels R.M. Bundy D.A. Selkirk M.E. Smith D.F. Anderson R.M. Nature. 1993; 365: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). This aspect of helminth infections may partly account for the persistence of parasitic helminths in host populations, since heavily infected, susceptible individuals may act as reservoirs of infection for the rest of the population. This variation in infection intensity within a single population is believed to be the combined result of three interacting factors (24Poulin R. Adv. Parasitol. 1996; 37: 107-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): genetic heterogeneity in the host population, genetic heterogeneity in the parasite population, and phenotypic plasticity on the part of the parasite in response to prevailing intrahost conditions which vary from host to host. Phenotypic plasticity, or parasite responsiveness to host factors such as species, age, sex, reproductive condition, and immune status is advantageous to the parasite in allowing it to maximize reproductive success under the limitations determined by conditions within an individual host. Helminth life history traits influenced by host factors include migration routes taken through host tissues and organs, entry into hypobiotic or dormant states, length of prepatent period, longevity, final body size, and fecundity. Clearly, phenotypic plasticity requires that parasites be able to receive and respond to signals from their hosts. Phenotypic plasticity by a parasitic helminth in response to a host factor was recently demonstrated by Amiri et al. (2Amiri P. Locksley R.M. Parslow T.G. Sadick M. Rector E. Ritter D. McKerrow J.H. Nature. 1992; 356: 604-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar), who showed that the host cytokine tumor necrosis factor α was a regulator of fecundity for S. mansoni. Furthermore, transmission of signals between male and female schistosomes is a well recognized but poorly defined phenomenon (25LoVerde P.T. Chen L. Parasitol. Today. 1991; 7: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Like other parasitic platyhelminths, the schistosome surface tegument is composed of a layer of cytoplasm, bound externally by a lipid bilayer, which therefore forms a potentially intimate interface between the parasite and its environment. These observations led us to hypothesize that parasitic flatworms may express membrane-bound receptor proteins on their surface membranes that engage external factors in the surrounding milieu and transduce signals into the tegumental cytoplasm, thus providing a mechanism by which signals in the immediate environment might be detected. Using the S. mansoni model system, we have now identified a candidate for just such a receptor in that (i) the predicted amino acid sequence of this candidate protein displays a considerable level of identity to members of a known family of signal-transducing receptors, and (ii) the protein is expressed at the parasite surface, where we would expect interactions between external ligands and parasite receptors to occur. With the identification of SmRK-1, platyhelminths now become the most primitive organisms known to possess RSTKs, an important step toward elucidating the evolutionary origins of this receptor family. In other organisms, signaling by TGFβ-like molecules requires the presence of both a type I and type II RSTK (26Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Carcamo J. Zentella A. Doody J. Laiho M. Wang X.F. Massague J. Cell. 1992; 71: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1369) Google Scholar, 27Letsou A. Arora K. Wrana J.L. Simin K. Twombly V. Jamal J. Staehling-Hampton K. Hoffmann F.M. Gelbart W.M. Massague J. O'Connor M.B. Cell. 1995; 80: 899-908Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Ligand is first engaged by the type II receptor, which is a constitutively active kinase. The ligand-type II receptor complex then recruits a type I receptor, which is subsequently phosphorylated by the type II receptor (28Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massague J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the type I receptor within the GS domain by the type II receptor results in activation of the type I receptor kinase activity, which then propagates the signal intracellularly by phosphorylating cytoplasmic Smad proteins (29Massague J. Cell. 1996; 85: 947-950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar). Since the GS domain of the type I receptor plays a critical role in regulation of type I receptor kinase activity by the type II receptor (19Wieser R. Wrana J.L. Massague J. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2199-2208Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), it will be of interest to determine if type I-like receptors such as Daf-1 and SmRK-1, which possess atypical GS domains (Fig. 1, panel A), are regulated by type II receptors in the same way as other type I receptors. To facilitate the examination of this issue, we are attempting to identify schistosome type II receptors that may act as partners for SmRK-1. Our observation that SmRK-1 becomes phosphorylated in adult parasites (Fig. 6) suggests that it may interact with other protein kinases in the schistosome tegument. Alternatively, SmRK-1 phosphorylation may occur as the result of an autophosphorylation mechanism. We have found that when intact adult schistosomes are specifically surface-labeled with a polar, water-soluble form of biotin, the SmRK-1 protein becomes biotinylated (Fig. 4), indicating that it is expressed on the parasite surface. Experiments using immunofluorescence microscopy further confirmed the localization of the SmRK-1 protein to the parasite surface, where SmRK-1 expression was found to be restricted to the tubercles on the dorsal surfaces of male worms (Fig. 5). We have not been able to detect SmRK-1 expression elsewhere in male tissues or in female parasites using these techniques. However, we have detected SmRK-1 protein in carcass extracts of adult parasites (Fig. 3), suggesting that SmRK-1 may be expressed in other schistosome tissues. Alternatively, this result may represent SmRK-1 protein contained within small amounts of residual tegumental material that was not removed from the parasite carcasses during the preparation of the tegument extract. Our results indicate that the SmRK-1 protein is expressed at detectable levels only after the second week of infection of the mammalian host (Fig. 7). The timing of SmRK-1 expression during the schistosome life cycle suggests that the protein is either: (i) involved in host-parasite interactions at the final destination of the parasite within the mammalian host, since SmRK-1 protein is only expressed after arrival of the parasite in the hepatic portal circulation, or (ii) SmRK-1 is involved in male-female interactions, since differentiation of the separate sexes coincides with initiation of SmRK-1 expression. The expression of SmRK-1 on the tubercles of males suggests that the SmRK-1 ligand may be of host origin, since during the normal course of infection, the tubercles of the adult male are tightly apposed against the blood vessel endothelial cell membrane (30Hockley D.J. Adv. Parasitol. 1973; 11: 233-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). A ligand of endothelial cell origin secreted at the luminal surface would therefore be in close proximity to the SmRK-1 receptor. Unfortunately, the lack of homology between SmRK-1 and other RSTKs does not allow us to make deductions about the nature of the ligand, although it is most likely a member of the TGFβ family of growth factors. The hypothesis that a platyhelminth receptor may bind a vertebrate transforming growth factor β-like molecule is plausible, since it has already been shown that the Daf-4 RSTK from C. elegans is capable of binding human bone morphogenetic protein-2 and bone morphogenetic protein-4 when expressed in mammalian cells (31Estevez M. Attisano L. Wrana J.L. Albert P.S. Massague J. Riddle D.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 644-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). While an interaction between Daf-4 and these growth factors would not occur under natural circumstances, this result emphasizes the highly conserved nature of the RSTK signaling system, which makes it an ideal candidate system for transducing signals between parasites and their hosts. It is also of interest to note that the Daf-1 and -4 RSTKs from C. elegansare involved in controlling a developmental switch in the nematode life cycle which occurs in response to conditions in the animal's environment. When C. elegans larvae are subjected to starvation or overcrowded conditions, development proceeds to an arrested third stage dauer larva. Mutations in the daf-1 anddaf-4 genes result in constitutive dauer larva formation regardless of environmental conditions. Control of developmental responses to environmental signals by RSTK signaling mechanisms might therefore be a widespread phenomenon among the various invertebrate phyla. The identification of the SmRK-1 ligand will be an important step toward elucidating the function of this receptor and may provide new insights into the molecular interactions that occur between parasitic helminths and their hosts."

The ever expanding size of the EGF family has made distinguishing the activities of these hormones paramount. We show here that EPR activates two members of the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and ErbB4. Therefore by these criteria, EPR is qualitatively similar to another EGF family hormone, betacellulin (BTC). Yet, here we also demonstrate quantitative differences between EPR and BTC. EPR stimulates higher levels of EGFR phosphorylation than does BTC, whereas BTC stimulates higher levels of ErbB4 phosphorylation than does EPR. Moreover, the EPR and BTC dose response curves show that although EGFR is more sensitive to EPR than is ErbB4, ErbB4 is more sensitive to BTC than is EGFR. Finally, ErbB2, which is not activated by EPR when expressed on its own, increases the sensitivity of ErbB4 for activation by EPR. Therefore, these results establish that EPR exhibits novel activities and modes of regulation, which may have significant implications for EPR function in vivo.

EGF, transforming growth factor α (TGF-α), and amphiregulin all bind exclusively to the EGF receptor (EGFR).

Betacellulin (BTC) combines some of the properties of EGF and NRG by activating EGFR and ErbB4 (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). EPR was initially purified from the conditioned medium of a tumorigenic clone of NIH3T3 fibroblasts. It competes with EGF for binding to A431 cells, which overexpress EGFR, suggesting that EPR is a ligand for EGFR (17Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Since at least one of the EGF family hormones that activates EGFR also activates ErbB4, we wished to evaluate EPR function in a set of cell lines expressing all four ErbB family receptors, both singly and in every pairwise combination. We demonstrate here that EPR activates not only EGFR, but ErbB4 as well. However, the dose-response curves for BTC and EPR in a cell line expressing both EGFR and ErbB4 are markedly different. Whereas ErbB4 is more responsive to BTC than is EGFR, ErbB4 is less responsive to EPR than is EGFR. Moreover, ErbB2 expression increases saturated ErbB4 phosphorylation in response to EPR and dramatically enhances the sensitivity of ErbB4 for activation by EPR as well. In this respect EPR resembles NRG, which displays a low affinity for ErbB3 that increases in cells where ErbB2 is co-expressed (12Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

For EGFR expression, BaF3/EGFR+ErbB4 is higher than BaF3/EGFR+ErbB2, which is higher than BaF3/EGFR+ErbB3. For ErbB2 expression, BaF3/ErbB2+ErbB4 is equivalent to BaF3/EGFR+ErbB2, both of which are markedly higher than BaF3/ErbB2+ErbB3. The levels of ErbB3 expression are similiar in the BaF3/EGFR+ErbB3, BaF3/ErbB2+ErbB3, and BaF3/ErbB3+ErbB4 cell lines. The levels of ErbB4 expression are similiar in the BaF3/EGFR+ErbB4, BaF3/Neu+ErbB4, and BaF3/ErbB3+ErbB4 cell lines (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F.

Specificity of antireceptor antibodies has been verified by testing for cross-reactivity (data not shown). Immunoblot autoradiographs were digitized using a Hewlett-Packard 3p flatbed scanner set for 600 dpi resolution and controlled by Hewlett-Packard Deskscan II for Macintosh software. Images were cropped using Adobe Photoshop, and the band intensity was quantified using NIH Image software. Net receptor activation was calculated by subtracting the amount of tyrosine phosphorylation observed in samples from mock-stimulated cells. We first sought to identify which ErbB family receptors are activated by EPR when the receptors are expressed individually. We previously developed a panel of cell lines based on the mouse BaF3 hematopoietic cell line that expresses the four ErbB family receptors, both singly and in every pairwise combination. Hence, we incubated the BaF3 cell lines ectopically expressing EGFR, ErbB2, or ErbB4 with EPR. EPR, like BTC, stimulated EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation, consistent with published results suggesting that EPR binds EGFR (17Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Uchida D. Takayama Y. Isobe T. Okuyama T. Hanada K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7495-7500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, EGFR panel; compare lanes E and B withM). However, EPR did not stimulate phosphorylation of ErbB2 or ErbB4 (Fig. 1, ErbB2 and ErbB4 panels; comparelanes E and M). In contrast, the positive control NRGβ stimulated ErbB2 tyrosine phosphorylation and BTC stimulated ErbB4 phosphorylation. The ErbB2 phosphorylation observed in BaF3/ErbB2 cells stimulated with NRG is the result of transmodulation of ErbB2 by the NRG receptor ErbB3, which is endogenously expressed at low levels in BaF3 cells (14Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Neither EPR nor any of the other EGF family ligands tested to date stimulated ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation in BaF3 cells expressing only ErbB3 (data not shown) (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), these experiments do not rule out EPR binding to ErbB3. Since EPR activates EGFR, we next determined whether EPR activates the other three ErbB family receptors in trans via EGFR. A panel of BaF3 cell lines ectopically expressing EGFR together with one of the other three ErbB family receptors was stimulated with EPR. EPR activated the EGFR in all three cell lines (Fig. 2 A; compare E α1 lanes with the M α1 lanes). Both EPR (E lanes) and the positive control TGF-α (T lanes) strongly activated ErbB2 in the cell line co-expressing EGFR+ErbB2 (Fig. 2 A, EGFR+ErbB2 panel; α2 lanes). In contrast, neither EPR nor TGF-α activated ErbB3 or ErbB4 (Fig. 2 A, EGFR+ErbB3 and EGFR+ErbB4 panels; α3 or α4 lanes). This is consistent with the conclusion that ErbB2 is a preferential target for transmodulation by the EGFR compared with the other ErbB family receptors (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M.

Therefore, BaF3 cells expressing both ErbB2 and ErbB3 or both ErbB3 and ErbB4 were stimulated with EPR to determine if ErbB3 is a receptor for EPR. In the ErbB2+ErbB3 cell line, the positive control NRGβ activated both receptors (Fig. 2 B, ErbB2+ErbB3 panel, compare N laneswith M lanes), whereas in the ErbB3+ErbB4 cell line NRGβ stimulated a marked increase in ErbB3 phosphorylation and a modest increase in ErbB4 phosphorylation (Fig. 2 B,ErbB3+ErbB4 panel, compare N lanes with M lanes). In contrast, EPR did not stimulate receptor phosphorylation in either of these cell lines, suggesting that ErbB3 is not a receptor for EPR (Fig. 2 B; compare E laneswith M lanes). BTC activates both ErbB4 and EGFR when expressed individually (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). We tested whether EPR behaves like BTC and also activates ErbB4 when expressed alone using derivatives of the CEM human T-lymphoblastoid cell line that ectopically expresses ErbB4 alone or both ErbB2 and ErbB4 (10Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). EPR activated ErbB4 in CEM cells expressing ErbB4 alone and both receptors in CEM cells expressing ErbB2 and ErbB4 together (Fig. 3; compare E lanes withM lanes). In experiments done in parallel using identical growth factor concentrations, EPR did not activate ErbB4 in BaF3 cells expressing ErbB4 alone (also see Fig. 1) but stimulated ErbB2 and ErbB4 phosphorylation in BaF3 cells expressing both ErbB2 and ErbB4 (data not shown). It is unclear why EPR failed to activate ErbB4 in the BaF3 cells expressing ErbB4 alone. Nonetheless, because EPR activates EGFR as well as ErbB4, EPR resembles BTC, which also activates these receptors (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). Since BTC and EPR can activate EGFR and ErbB4 when the receptors are expressed individually, we measured BTC and EPR stimulation of EGFR and ErbB4 phosphorylation in BaF3 cells that express both receptors together (Fig. 4). BTC stimulated saturated levels of EGFR phosphorylation at a concentration of 10 ng/ml, whereas BTC stimulated saturated levels of ErbB4 phosphorylation at a concentration of 25 ng/ml. Therefore, in subsequent experiments we have assumed that 100 ng/ml BTC stimulates saturated levels of EGFR and ErbB4 phosphorylation. At a concentration of 4000 ng/ml, EPR stimulates slightly greater levels of EGFR phosphorylation than does BTC (Fig. 4). In contrast, 4000 ng/ml EPR stimulates much lower levels of ErbB4 phosphorylation than does BTC (Fig. 4). This suggests that EPR stimulates EGFR more than ErbB4 and that EGFR is more sensitive than ErbB4 to EPR. We investigated this possibility by comparing EGFR and ErbB4 phosphorylation in BaF3/EGFR and CEM/ErbB4 cells stimulated with increasing concentrations of EPR (Fig. 5 A). At saturation, EPR stimulated a slightly higher level of EGFR phosphorylation (1.7-fold) than did BTC, whereas EPR stimulated a much lower level of ErbB4 phosphorylation (0.3-fold) than did BTC (Fig. 5 C). We next compared the dose sensitivity of EGFR and ErbB4 to EPR stimulation by plotting receptor phosphorylation relative to the maximal amounts of receptor phosphorylation stimulated by EPR (Fig. 5 D) to identify the EPR concentrations required for half-maximal receptor phosphorylation (Table I). Half-maximal EGFR phosphorylation occurred at an EPR concentration of approximately 380 ng/ml (Fig. 5 D; Table I). In contrast, half-maximal ErbB4 phosphorylation required about a 4-fold higher concentration of EPR with half-maximal activation occurring at an EPR concentration of approximately 1790 ng/ml (Fig. 5 D; Table I).Table IRelative sensitivities of EGFR and ErbB4 to EPR and BTCCell line & receptorEPR yielding half-maximal receptor activationBTC yielding half-maximal receptor activationBaF3/EGFR380 ng/mlNT1-aNT, not tested.CEM/ErbB41790 ng/mlNTBaF3/EGFR+ErbB4 EGFR320 ng/ml35 ng/ml ErbB4790 ng/ml5 ng/mlCEM/ErbB2+ErbB4 ErbB2400 ng/mlNT ErbB4630 ng/mlNT1-a NT, not tested. Open table in a new tab The affinity of NRG for cells expressing ErbB3 is greater when these cells also express ErbB2 (12Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

Hence, we evaluated the possibility that ErbB2 modulates ErbB4 activation by EPR by stimulating CEM/ErbB4 and CEM/ErbB2+ErbB4 cells with increasing concentrations of EPR (Fig. 5, A and B). Relative to the BTC positive control, EPR stimulated 2-fold higher levels of ErbB4 phosphorylation in the ErbB2+ErbB4 cell line than in cells expressing ErbB4 alone (Fig. 5 C). Therefore, ErbB2, which is not activated by EPR when expressed by itself (Fig. 1), doubles the magnitude of ErbB4 activation by EPR at saturation. We next examined the effects of ErbB2 expression on the sensitivity of ErbB4 to EPR (Fig. 5 D). Half-maximal ErbB4 phosphorylation occurred at an EPR concentration of approximately 1790 ng/ml in the cell line expressing ErbB4 alone (Fig. 5 D; Table I), but occurred at an EPR concentration of approximately 630 ng/ml (Fig. 5 D; Table I) in the ErbB2+ErbB4 cell line. This shift in the EPR dose-response curve in the ErbB2+ErbB4 cell line compared with the ErbB4 cell line suggests that ErbB2 expression increases the affinity of ErbB4 for EPR and implies that ErbB2-ErbB4 heterodimers have a higher affinity for EPR than do ErbB4-ErbB4 homodimers. EPR resembles BTC in its ability to activate either EGFR or ErbB4 when expressed individually (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar). Yet, at saturation EPR stimulated almost 2-fold more EGFR phosphorylation than BTC, whereas BTC activated about 3-fold more ErbB4 phosphorylation than did EPR (Fig. 5, A and C). This suggested that BTC and EPR are functionally distinct. Hence, we compared EGFR and ErbB4 phosphorylation following stimulation with increasing concentrations of BTC or EPR in a BaF3 cell line that expresses both EGFR and ErbB4 (Fig. 6 A). We first compared the magnitude of receptor phosphorylation stimulated by EPR and BTC by plotting receptor phosphorylation relative to the maximal phosphorylation stimulated by BTC (Fig. 6, B andC). In agreement with results presented above (Fig. 5,A and C), EPR stimulated higher saturated levels of EGFR phosphorylation than BTC, whereas BTC activated greater ErbB4 phosphorylation than did EPR (Fig. 6, A and C). However, the magnitude of these differences was much less in the EGFR+ErbB4 cell line compared with the differences in phosphorylation that we observed between the cell lines expressing EGFR and ErbB4 individually (Fig. 5, A and C). Next, we compared the sensitivities of EGFR and ErbB4 with BTC and EPR by identifying the growth factor concentrations required for half-maximal receptor phosphorylation. Half-maximal EGFR activation occurred at a BTC concentration of approximately 35 ng/ml, whereas half-maximal ErbB4 activation occurred at a BTC concentration of approximately 5 ng/ml (Fig. 6 B; Table I). In contrast, half-maximal EGFR activation occurred at an EPR concentration of approximately 320 ng/ml, whereas half-maximal ErbB4 activation occurred at an EPR concentration of approximately 790 ng/ml (Fig. 6 C; Table I). This suggests that ErbB4 is 7-fold more sensitive to BTC than is EGFR, whereas EGFR is more than 2-fold more sensitive to EPR than is ErbB4. Finally, these results illustrate that EGFR expression, like ErbB2 expression, shifts the EPR dose-response curve in cells expressing ErbB4. Half-maximal ErbB4 phosphorylation in a CEM cell line expressing ErbB4 alone occurs at an EPR concentration of 1790 ng/ml (Fig. 5 D; Table I). In contrast, half-maximal ErbB4 phosphorylation in BaF3 cells expressing both EGFR and ErbB4 occurs at 790 ng/ml (Fig. 6 C; Table I). Although EPR and BTC stimulate qualitatively identical patterns of receptor phosphorylation, these hormones are quantitatively distinct. One possible mechanism is that EPR and BTC stimulate EGFR and ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation at different sites. This would account for the higher levels of EGFR activation by EPR compared with BTC and the higher levels of ErbB4 activation by BTC compared with EPR. Moreover, this would also enable these hormones to couple to distinct receptor effectors and physiologic responses. Therefore, we compared EPR and BTC induction of receptor coupling with physiologic responses. BaF3 cells require interleukin-3 (IL3) for survival and for proliferation. Activation of either EGFR or ErbB2 permits survival of BaF3 cells in the absence of IL3 (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar, 14Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). However, ErbB4 activation by either NRG or BTC is not coupled to IL3-independent survival (7,14). In BaF3 cells expressing both ErbB2 and ErbB4 together, activation by either BTC or NRG induces IL3-independent survival, presumably through ErbB2 transmodulation by ErbB4 (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar,14Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). EPR, like BTC (7Riese D.J., II Bermingham Y. van Raaij T.M. Buckley S. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 345-353PubMed Google Scholar), induces IL3-independent survival in BaF3 cells expressing EGFR, but not in vector control BaF3 cells or cells expressing ErbB2 (Fig. 7). (The IL3-independent response of BaF3 cells expressing ErbB2 to NRG is the result of ErbB2 transmodulation by endogenous ErbB3 in these cells (14Riese D.J., II van Raaij T.M. Plowman G.D Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5770-5776Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).) EPR, BTC, and NRG all induced IL3 independence in cells co-expressing ErbB2 and ErbB4 (Fig. 7). This implies that BTC and NRG are functionally equivalent. However, the response to BTC and NRG is greater than the response to EPR, which may reflect subtle functional differences between BTC and EPR. We previously demonstrated that the EGF family of peptide growth factors can be divided into three distinct functional groups (8Riese D.J., II Kim E.D. Elenius K. Buckley S. Klagsbrun M. Plowman G.D. Stern D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20047-20052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). The first group consists of EGF, TGF-α, and amphiregulin. These hormones bind and activate only the EGFR, but they can activate the other three ErbB family receptorsin trans via heterodimerization with the EGFR. The second group consists of NRG and NRG2, which bind ErbB3 and ErbB4 and transmodulate EGFR and Neu via the binding receptors. The third group consists of BTC, which binds and activates both EGFR and ErbB4. Recent data suggests that heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor may also bind and activate EGFR and ErbB4, which would make heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor a member of this group as well (22Elenius K. Paul S. Allison G. Sun J. Klagsbrun M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although EPR activates both EGFR and ErbB4, the interactions of EPR with these two receptors appear to be quite different. Compared with BTC, EPR stimulates higher levels of EGFR phosphorylation and lower levels of ErbB4 phosphorylation. Whereas both EPR and BTC stimulate EGFR and ErbB4 homodimerization and signaling, the geometry of the receptor dimers induced by EPR and BTC may be subtly different. The alignment of the kinase domain of one receptor molecule of a receptor homodimer with the autophosphorylation site of the other receptor molecule following EPR stimulation could be different from this alignment following BTC stimulation, affecting the cross-phosphorylation within receptor dimers. Alternatively, ligand-induced changes in the conformation of the receptor kinase domains might be different when the receptors are activated by BTC and EPR. Therefore, BTC and EPR may differentially stimulate receptor kinase activity. In either scenario, BTC and EPR could stimulate receptor autophosphorylation on different tyrosine residues, which could also be reflected in differences in gross levels of receptor phosphorylation. In this manner BTC and EPR could differentially modulate receptor coupling to signaling effectors and physiologic responses. Another difference between EPR and BTC is that while EGFR is much more sensitive than ErbB4 to EPR, EGFR is less sensitive than ErbB4 to BTC. This suggests that although the affinity of EPR for EGFR is higher than the affinity for ErbB4, the affinity of BTC for EGFR is lower than the affinity for ErbB4. This too suggests that BTC and EPR have distinct biological functions, even in cells with identical patterns of ErbB family receptor expression. Another important aspect of EPR function is the observation that the sensitivity of ErbB4 for EPR and the magnitude of ErbB4 activation by EPR can be modulated by the expression of other ErbB family receptors. EGFR expression increases the sensitivity of ErbB4 for EPR, suggesting that EGFR-ErbB4 heterodimers have a higher affinity for EPR than ErbB4-ErbB4 homodimers (Fig. 5, A and D; Fig. 6,A and C; Table I). Of course an alternative explanation is that the increased ErbB4 sensitivity in the presence of EGFR is due solely to EPR-induced transphosphorylation of ErbB4 by EGFR. ErbB2 also increases the sensitivity of ErbB4 for EPR (Fig. 5,A-D; Table I). Because EPR does not activate ErbB2 in cells devoid of EGFR or ErbB4 (Figs. 1 and 7), the mechanism for the increased sensitivity of ErbB4 for EPR may be that ErbB2-ErbB4 heterodimers have a higher affinity for EPR than do ErbB4-ErbB4 homodimers. These results resemble observations made with NRG, which does not bind to ErbB2, binds with low affinity to cells expressing ErbB3, and binds with higher affinity to cells that express both ErbB2 and ErbB3 (12Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L. Carraway III., K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14661-14665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). ErbB2 expression also increases the magnitude of ErbB4 activation by EPR. These observations that ErbB4 activation by EPR can be influenced by EGFR or ErbB2 is consistent with existing models for receptor heterodimerization and transmodulation. It has been proposed that receptor heterodimerization is mediated through low affinity hormone-receptor interactions and heterotypic receptor-receptor contacts, after which there is cross-phosphorylation by the receptor kinase domains (23Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). It is possible that EGFR and ErbB2 are favored over ErbB4 for dimerization with ErbB4 in the presence of EPR. Therefore, there would be greater ErbB4 dimerization in cells expressing EGFR and ErbB4 or Neu and ErbB4 than in cells expressing ErbB4 alone. This may account for the increased sensitivity of ErbB4 for EPR in the presence of EGFR or ErbB2. It is also possible that ErbB2 is a better kinase for ErbB4 than ErbB4 itself. Consequently, ErbB2 may cross-phosphorylate more ErbB4 tyrosine residues in receptor heterodimers than ErbB4 would in receptor homodimers. Similarly, ErbB2 may phosphorylate the same tyrosine residues as ErbB4 to a greater extent than does ErbB4. Either of these last two possibilities would account for the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of ErbB4 by EPR in the presence of ErbB2. As this manuscript was being prepared for submission, it was reported that radiolabeled EPR can be cross-linked to EGFR and ErbB4 in human breast tumor cell lines but not to ErbB2 or ErbB3. Furthermore, EPR stimulated high levels of EGFR and ErbB4 tyrosine phosphorylation and more modest levels of ErbB2 and ErbB3 tyrosine phosphorylation (24Komurasaki T. Toyoda H. Uchida D. Morimoto S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Because the cell lines used in these studies express at least two and in some cases all four ErbB family receptors, some caution must be used in interpreting these results. Nonetheless, these data are entirely consistent with our findings that EGFR and ErbB4 are the receptors for EPR. To date there have been only a few clues to EPR function. EPR transcripts are not detected in normal adult mouse liver, kidney, brain, spleen, testis, or skeletal muscles. However, low levels of EPR transcripts are detectable in adult mouse lung, smooth muscle, and heart, whereas more robust EPR transcription is observed in whole embryo RNA samples from 7-day-old mouse embryos (25Toyoda H. Komurasaki T. Ikeda Y. Yoshimoto M. Morimoto S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). 3T. Komurasaki, unpublished data. This implies that EPR plays a significant role in early mammalian development but only a limited role in adult tissues. Additional hints to EPR function arise from our data suggesting that EPR is a ligand for both EGFR and ErbB4. In most contexts EGFR activation is coupled to cellular DNA synthesis and proliferation. In contrast, there is mounting evidence that activated ErbB4 is coupled to growth inhibition, differentiation, and possibly tumor suppression. NRG, a ligand for ErbB3 and ErbB4, inhibits the proliferation and stimulates the differentiation of a number of human breast tumor cell lines (26Peles, E., Bacus, S. S., Koski, R. A., Lu, H. S., Wen, D., Ogden, S. G., Ben Levy, R., and Yarden, Y. Cell, 69, 205–216.Google Scholar), whereas NRG implants stimulate the differentiation of the mouse mammary epithelium in vivo (27Jones F.E. Jerry D.J. Guarino B.C. Andrews G.C. Stern D.F. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 1031-1038PubMed Google Scholar). BTC stimulates the differentiation of pancreatic AR42J cells into insulin-secreting cells, but EGF and TGF-α do not (28Mashima H. Ohnishi H. Wakabayashi K. Mine T. Miyagawa J.-I. Hanafusa T. Seno M. Yamada H. Kojima I. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1647-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Finally, agonistic anti-ErbB4 antibodies stimulate the differentiation of human breast tumor cell lines (29Chen X. Levkowitz G. Tzahar E. Karunagaran D. Lavi S. Ben-Baruch N. Leitner O. Ratzkin B.J. Bacus S.S. Yarden Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7620-7629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and ErbB4 overexpression in breast cancer patients correlates with progesterone receptor expression, which is a marker for longer disease-free survival and better overall prognosis (30Bacus S.S. Chin D. Yarden Y. Zelnick C.R. Stern D.F. Am. J. Path. 1996; 148: 549-558PubMed Google Scholar). Because EPR is a ligand for both EGFR and ErbB4, EPR may act as a proliferative agent in cells expressing EGFR and may act as a differentiation agent in cells that express ErbB4. Furthermore, because EPR activation of ErbB4 is regulated by ErbB2 and activated ErbB2 appears to couple to mitogenesis and cell proliferation, the effects of EPR on cells expressing ErbB4 may be tightly linked to a balance of ErbB4 and ErbB2 expression. In cells having relatively low levels of ErbB2, EPR may have little effect because it fails to bind to ErbB4, and in cells having moderate levels of ErbB2 and high levels of ErbB4, EPR may act as a differentiation agent and inhibit cell proliferation, because the relatively high levels of ErbB4 signaling may overcome the effects of ErbB2 signaling. Finally, in cells having relatively high levels of ErbB2 relative to ErbB4, EPR may stimulate such high levels of ErbB2 signaling that the effects of ErbB4 signaling are overcome, and cell proliferation is stimulated. In sum, our data suggests that the physiologic response to EPR will be dictated by relative levels of EGFR, ErbB2, and ErbB4 expression and not just the absolute level of expression of any single ErbB family receptor.

https://openalex.org/W2035602774,"We previously reported three families with type A insulin-resistant syndrome who had mutations, either Asp1179 or Leu1193, in the kinase domain of the insulin receptor. The extreme insulin resistance of these patients was found to be caused by the decreased number of insulin receptors on the cell surface, due to the intracellular rapid degradation (Imamura, T., Takata, Y., Sasaoka, T., Takada, Y., Morioka, H., Haruta, T., Sawa, T., Iwanishi, M., Yang, G. H., Suzuki, Y., Hamada, J., and Kobayashi, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem.269, 31019–31027). In the present study, we first examined whether these mutations caused rapid degradation of unprocessed proreceptors, using the exon 13 deleted mutant insulin receptors (ΔEx13-IR), which were accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum as unprocessed proreceptors. The addition of Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutation to ΔEx13-IR caused accelerated degradation of the unprocessed ΔEx13-IR in the transfected COS-7 cells. Next, we tested whether these mutant receptors were degraded by the proteasome. Treatment with proteasome inhibitors Z-Leu-Leu-Nva-H (MG-115) or Z-Leu-Leu-Leu-H (MG-132) prevented the accelerated degradation of these mutant receptors, resulting in increased amounts of the mutant receptors in the COS-7 cells. Essentially the same results were obtained in the patient's transformed lymphocytes. Finally, we found that these mutant receptors bound to heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). To determine whether Hsp90 played an important role in the accelerated receptor degradation, we examined the effect of anti-Hsp90 antibody on the mutant receptor degradation. The microinjection of anti-Hsp90 antibody into cells prevented the accelerated degradation of both Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant insulin receptors. Taken together, these results suggest that Hsp90 is involved in dislocation of the mutant insulin receptors out of the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol, where the mutant receptors are degraded by the proteasome.

Various mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in patients with severe insulin resistance (1Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutated insulin receptors in the cells gave us the opportunity to understand the function and processing of insulin receptor protein. Among the various mechanisms for the insulin resistance in these patients, certain patients with the insulin receptor mutations showed a reduced number of insulin receptors on the cell surface although the mRNA of insulin receptor was normally expressed (1Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar).

Thus, it was likely that the difference in the molecular chaperones to which the mutant insulin receptor tightly bound determined the fate of mutant insulin receptors. Although the association of these specific chaperons with some of mutant insulin receptors has been described, the role of molecular chaperones and the site where these mutants degraded have not been well characterized.The mechanism of intracellular degradation of abnormal proteins in the secretory pathway has not been clearly understood. However, recent observations suggest that unfolded or unassembled proteins are retained in the ER by chaperones, transported back into the cytosol and degraded by the proteasome (17Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H.

In the present study, to investigate the mechanism of the accelerated degradation of both Asp1179and Leu1193 mutant insulin receptors, we examined whether these mutations caused accelerated degradation of unprocessed proreceptors retained in the ER and whether these mutant receptors were degraded by the proteasome, and finally which molecular chaperone was involved in degradation. We now report that the mutant insulin proreceptors in the ER are rapidly transported to the proteasome for degradation through the binding to Hsp90.DISCUSSIONMost of the naturally occurring mutations in the β-subunit of the insulin receptor interfere with processing of proreceptors to the subunits, leading to accumulation of proreceptors in the ER. As reported previously, these mutant insulin receptors were tightly associated with BiP, an intra-ER chaperone, and remained in the ER (16Accili D. Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mosthaf L. Ullrich A. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 586-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the mutant insulin receptor lacking the coding region of exon 13 was not processed to the subunits and was also associated with BiP (22Haruta T. Sawa T. Takata Y. Imamura T. Takada Y. Morioka H. Yang G.H. Kobayashi M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 29Sawa T. Imamura T. Haruta T. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Takata Y. Takada Y. Morioka H. Ishihara H. Usui I. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since this ΔEx13 insulin receptor remained unprocessed and was easily distinguished from normal matured insulin receptors, we created double mutant insulin receptors that had both ΔEx13 and either Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, and monitored the processing and degradation of this mutant insulin receptors. Addition of either Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutations to ΔEx13 insulin receptor led to rapid receptor degradation (15Imamura T. Takata Y. Sasaoka T. Takada Y. Morioka H. Haruta T. Sawa T. Iwanishi M. Hu Y.G. Suzuki Y. Hamada J. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31019-31027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these point mutations were specific for the cause of accelerated degradation of unprocessed insulin receptors that existed in the ER.The ER-associated proteins destined for degradation are transported to the cytosol, where proteolysis is catalyzed by the proteasome (17Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). By using two proteasome inhibitors, we clearly demonstrated that proteasome played a major role in degradation of the mutant receptors. Furthermore, the inhibitors increased the amount of insulin receptor protein in the transformed lymphocyte derived from the patient with Asp1179 mutation. Thus, the proteasome inhibitors rescued these mutant receptors, which could be transported to the cell surface. These results suggest that both Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant insulin proreceptors are degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol before their transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, because the degradation occurs before the processing from the proreceptor to the α- and β-subunits takes place at the Golgi apparatus.The degradation by the proteasome usually requires polyubiquitination of the targeted proteins (18Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 30Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

However, we could not detect any specific association of ubiquitin with these mutant insulin receptors. Therefore, Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant insulin receptor proteins were degraded by the proteasome without direct ubiquitination in the transfected COS-7 cells and the patient's cells. In fact, the proteasome degradation of certain proteins does not require ubiquitination (19Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We demonstrated that Hsp90 was tightly associated with these mutant receptors, both in the cells and in the cell-free system, using GST fusion proteins. Furthermore, the degradation of the mutant insulin receptor protein was partially inhibited by microinjection of the anti-Hsp90 antibody, leading to the increased amount of these mutant insulin receptors in the cells. These experiments suggested that Hsp90 played a key role in transport of these mutant receptors out of the ER and in the subsequent degradation by the proteasome in the cytosol.Hsp90, which exists in the cytosol, functions as a molecular chaperon, by the complex formation with steroid receptor (35Bohen S.P.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8123-8129Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, it has not been reported that Hsp90 participates in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded proteins. Hsp90 functions in co-operation with several kinds of molecular chaperones, such as Hsc70, as we demonstrated in GST-IRc-Hsp90 binding studies in the presence of Hsc70. Furthermore, we observed that Hsp90 associated with ubiquitin in the COS-7 cells expressing Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutant type or wild-type insulin receptors. These results suggest that the association of the mutant insulin receptors with Hsp90 might be followed by further complex formation with ubiquitin and Hsc70. It is also possible that other chaperons, which we could not identify, might participate in the ER-associated protein degradation.The mechanism whereby misfolded proteins are dislocated from the ER is not clearly understood. Recent observations by Weirtz et al.(33Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) suggest that the Sec61 complex is thought to have a role in the dislocation of proteins from the ER to the cytosol, and that the misfolded proteins could be caught in transit through the channel. It should be further investigated whether the mutant insulin receptors such as Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutant receptor are also dislocated from the ER to the cytosol in the similar fashion.Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutations may cause a significant change in tertiary structure of the receptor that can be specifically recognized by Hsp90. The close location and surface exposure of Glu1179 and Trp1193 in the tertiary structure of insulin receptor β-subunits (41Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) would support the importance of these amino acids for Hsp90 binding. Thus, it is likely that other mutations in the kinase domain may cause similar phenomena as shown in Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutations. Another mutation, Asp1048 in the kinase domain (42Haruta T. Takata Y. Iwanishi M. Maegawa H. Imamura T. Egawa K. Itazu T. Kobayashi M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, did not lead to accelerated degradation, probably due to a relatively normally folded structure of the receptor protein. Although there are some other mutants of the kinase domain that show the decreased insulin binding (43Cama A. Quon M.J. de la Luz Sierra M. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8383-8389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Moller D.E. Yokota A. Ginsberg-Fellner F. Flier J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether they are also degraded in the same manner as described above. On the other hand, in the α-subunit of the insulin receptor, only the Glu460 mutation showed the accelerated receptor degradation (14Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Cama A. Marcus-Samuels B. Rovira A. Bevins C.L. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21285-21296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it was reported that the Glu460 mutation caused lysosomal degradation of the insulin receptor on the way of recycling pathway, the mechanism of this degradation was different from that of Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant receptors.In conclusion, we have clarified a novel mechanism for degradation of the mutant insulin receptors by proteasome, in which Hsp90 plays a key role. Various mutations in the insulin receptor gene have been reported in patients with severe insulin resistance (1Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Analysis of the mutated insulin receptors in the cells gave us the opportunity to understand the function and processing of insulin receptor protein. Among the various mechanisms for the insulin resistance in these patients, certain patients with the insulin receptor mutations showed a reduced number of insulin receptors on the cell surface although the mRNA of insulin receptor was normally expressed (1Taylor S.I. Diabetes. 1992; 41: 1473-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Two major causes for this phenomenon have been described; the first is the impaired protein processing of mutated insulin receptors and accumulation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Hsp, heat shock protein; Hsc, heat shock cognate; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IRc, cytoplasmic domain of insulin receptor. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Hsp, heat shock protein; Hsc, heat shock cognate; BiP, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GST, glutathione S-transferase; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; IRc, cytoplasmic domain of insulin receptor.(3Kadowaki T.

Interestingly, Arg209 and Val382 mutant insulin receptors, which were accumulated in the ER, were associated with a molecular chaperone, immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP), one of the heat shock proteins in the ER (16Accili D. Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mosthaf L. Ullrich A. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 586-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it was likely that the difference in the molecular chaperones to which the mutant insulin receptor tightly bound determined the fate of mutant insulin receptors. Although the association of these specific chaperons with some of mutant insulin receptors has been described, the role of molecular chaperones and the site where these mutants degraded have not been well characterized. The mechanism of intracellular degradation of abnormal proteins in the secretory pathway has not been clearly understood.

Similarly, the mutant insulin receptor lacking the coding region of exon 13 was not processed to the subunits and was also associated with BiP (22Haruta T. Sawa T. Takata Y. Imamura T. Takada Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 8383-8389Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Moller D.E. Yokota A. Ginsberg-Fellner F. Flier J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), it remains to be determined whether they are also degraded in the same manner as described above. On the other hand, in the α-subunit of the insulin receptor, only the Glu460 mutation showed the accelerated receptor degradation (14Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Cama A. Marcus-Samuels B. Rovira A. Bevins C.L. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21285-21296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since it was reported that the Glu460 mutation caused lysosomal degradation of the insulin receptor on the way of recycling pathway, the mechanism of this degradation was different from that of Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant receptors.In conclusion, we have clarified a novel mechanism for degradation of the mutant insulin receptors by proteasome, in which Hsp90 plays a key role. Most of the naturally occurring mutations in the β-subunit of the insulin receptor interfere with processing of proreceptors to the subunits, leading to accumulation of proreceptors in the ER. As reported previously, these mutant insulin receptors were tightly associated with BiP, an intra-ER chaperone, and remained in the ER (16Accili D. Kadowaki T. Kadowaki H. Mosthaf L. Ullrich A. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 586-590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the mutant insulin receptor lacking the coding region of exon 13 was not processed to the subunits and was also associated with BiP (22Haruta T. Sawa T. Takata Y. Imamura T. Takada Y. Morioka H. Yang G.H. Kobayashi M. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 599-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 29Sawa T. Imamura T. Haruta T. Sasaoka T. Ishiki M. Takata Y. Takada Y. Morioka H. Ishihara H. Usui I. Kobayashi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Since this ΔEx13 insulin receptor remained unprocessed and was easily distinguished from normal matured insulin receptors, we created double mutant insulin receptors that had both ΔEx13 and either Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain, and monitored the processing and degradation of this mutant insulin receptors. Addition of either Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutations to ΔEx13 insulin receptor led to rapid receptor degradation (15Imamura T. Takata Y. Sasaoka T. Takada Y. Morioka H. Haruta T. Sawa T. Iwanishi M. Hu Y.G. Suzuki Y. Hamada J. Kobayashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31019-31027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that these point mutations were specific for the cause of accelerated degradation of unprocessed insulin receptors that existed in the ER. The ER-associated proteins destined for degradation are transported to the cytosol, where proteolysis is catalyzed by the proteasome (17Jentsch S. Schlenker S. Cell. 1995; 82: 881-884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 18Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). By using two proteasome inhibitors, we clearly demonstrated that proteasome played a major role in degradation of the mutant receptors. Furthermore, the inhibitors increased the amount of insulin receptor protein in the transformed lymphocyte derived from the patient with Asp1179 mutation. Thus, the proteasome inhibitors rescued these mutant receptors, which could be transported to the cell surface. These results suggest that both Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant insulin proreceptors are degraded by the proteasome in the cytosol before their transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus, because the degradation occurs before the processing from the proreceptor to the α- and β-subunits takes place at the Golgi apparatus. The degradation by the proteasome usually requires polyubiquitination of the targeted proteins (18Hiller M.M. Finger A. Schweiger M. Wolf D.H. Science. 1996; 273: 1725-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 30Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

However, we could not detect any specific association of ubiquitin with these mutant insulin receptors. Therefore, Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutant insulin receptor proteins were degraded by the proteasome without direct ubiquitination in the transfected COS-7 cells and the patient's cells. In fact, the proteasome degradation of certain proteins does not require ubiquitination (19Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13797-13801Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 33Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 25630-25638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To determine the mechanism by which these mutant insulin proreceptors were transported out of the ER and then presented to the proteasome, we tested the possibility that specific molecular chaperones might bind to the mutant proteins and present them to the proteasome. We demonstrated that Hsp90 was tightly associated with these mutant receptors, both in the cells and in the cell-free system, using GST fusion proteins. Furthermore, the degradation of the mutant insulin receptor protein was partially inhibited by microinjection of the anti-Hsp90 antibody, leading to the increased amount of these mutant insulin receptors in the cells. These experiments suggested that Hsp90 played a key role in transport of these mutant receptors out of the ER and in the subsequent degradation by the proteasome in the cytosol. Hsp90, which exists in the cytosol, functions as a molecular chaperon, by the complex formation with steroid receptor (35Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, it has not been reported that Hsp90 participates in the degradation of ER-associated misfolded proteins. Hsp90 functions in co-operation with several kinds of molecular chaperones, such as Hsc70, as we demonstrated in GST-IRc-Hsp90 binding studies in the presence of Hsc70. Furthermore, we observed that Hsp90 associated with ubiquitin in the COS-7 cells expressing Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutant type or wild-type insulin receptors. These results suggest that the association of the mutant insulin receptors with Hsp90 might be followed by further complex formation with ubiquitin and Hsc70. It is also possible that other chaperons, which we could not identify, might participate in the ER-associated protein degradation. The mechanism whereby misfolded proteins are dislocated from the ER is not clearly understood. Recent observations by Weirtz et al.(33Wiertz E.J.H.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M. Yu J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar) suggest that the Sec61 complex is thought to have a role in the dislocation of proteins from the ER to the cytosol, and that the misfolded proteins could be caught in transit through the channel. It should be further investigated whether the mutant insulin receptors such as Asp1179 or Leu1193 mutant receptor are also dislocated from the ER to the cytosol in the similar fashion. Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutations may cause a significant change in tertiary structure of the receptor that can be specifically recognized by Hsp90. The close location and surface exposure of Glu1179 and Trp1193 in the tertiary structure of insulin receptor β-subunits (41Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar) would support the importance of these amino acids for Hsp90 binding. Thus, it is likely that other mutations in the kinase domain may cause similar phenomena as shown in Asp1179 and Leu1193 mutations. Another mutation, Asp1048 in the kinase domain (42Haruta T. Takata Y. Iwanishi M. Maegawa H. Imamura T. Egawa K. Itazu T. Kobayashi M. Diabetes. 1993; 42: 1837-1844Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), however, did not lead to accelerated degradation, probably due to a relatively normally folded structure of the receptor protein. Although there are some other mutants of the kinase domain that show the decreased insulin binding (43Cama A. Quon M.J. de la Luz Sierra M. Taylor S.I. J. Biol.

It releases glucose from the non-reducing termini of cellodextrins with catalytic efficiency factors,k cat/K m, that increase approximately 9-fold as the degree of polymerization of these substrates increases from 2 to 6. Thus, the enzyme has a specificity and action pattern characteristic of both β-glucosidases (EC3.2.1.21) and the polysaccharide exohydrolase, (1,4)-β-glucan glucohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.74). At high concentrations (100 mm) of 4-nitrophenyl β-glucoside, β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII catalyzes glycosyl transfer reactions, which generate 4-nitrophenyl-β-laminaribioside, -cellobioside, and -gentiobioside. Subsite mapping with cellooligosaccharides indicates that the barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII has six substrate-binding subsites, each of which binds an individual β-glucosyl residue. Amino acid residues Glu181 and Glu391 are identified as the probable catalytic acid and catalytic nucleophile, respectively. The enzyme is a family 1 glycoside hydrolase that is likely to adopt a (β/α)8 barrel fold and in which the catalytic amino acid residues appear to be located at the bottom of a funnel-shaped pocket in the enzyme.

J. 1993; 293: 781-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). The two enzymes have been designated isoenzymes βI and βII, and have isoelectric points of 8.9 and 9.0, respectively. Amino acid sequence analyses reveal a single amino acid difference in the first 50 NH2-terminal amino acid residues, and the complete amino acid sequence of isoenzyme βII has been deduced from the nucleotide sequence of a corresponding cDNA clone (2Leah R. Kigel J. Svendsen I. Mundy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15789-15797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The function of the β-glucosidases in the germinated barley grain has not been defined unequivocally, but will clearly be related to their substrate specificities. It has been widely assumed that β-glucosidases prefer substrates of the type G-O-X, where G indicates the glucosyl residue and X can either be another glycosyl residue, for which the linkage position is not crucial, or a non-glycosyl aglycone group. As a result of the capacity of many β-glucosidases to hydrolyze glucosides with a range of glycosyl or non-glycosyl aglycone groups, non-physiological substrates such as 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside (4-NPG) 1The abbreviations used are: 4-NPG, 4-nitrophenyl β-d-glucopyranoside; BSA, bovine serum albumin; DP, degree of polymerization; EAC, 1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide; GEE, glycine ethyl ester; G4G3Gred (where G indicates a glucosyl residue, the numbers represent linkage types, and red is the reducing end), 3-O-β-cellobiosyl-d-glucose; G4G4G3Gred, 3-O-β-cellotriosyl-d-glucose; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; 4-NP, 4-nitrophenyl; β-glucosidase, β-d-glucoside glucohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.21); PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. have been synthesized to measure activity in convenient spectrophotometric assays; the barley enzymes have also been assayed in this way. It has further been assumed that the rate of hydrolysis of oligomeric substrates by β-glucosidases will remain approximately constant or decrease with increasing degree of polymerization (DP) of the substrate (5Reese E.T. Maguire A.H. Parrish F.W. Can. J. Biochem. 1968; 46: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). However, the barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII hydrolyzes (1,4)-β-oligoglucosides much more efficiently than it hydrolyzes the aryl-β-glucoside 4-NPG (3Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J.

The increased hydrolytic rate with oligosaccharides is a characteristic often observed with polysaccharide exohydrolases (5Reese E.T. Maguire A.H. Parrish F.W. Can. J. Biochem. 1968; 46: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), although the barley β-glucosidase is not able to hydrolyze polymeric (1,4)-β-glucans (2Leah R. Kigel J. Svendsen I. Mundy J. J.

Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to suggest that the barley enzyme could be classified either as a polysaccharide exohydrolase of the (1,4)-β-glucan glucohydrolase group (EC 3.2.1.74) or as a β-glucosidase of the EC 3.2.1.21 class. Because β-glucosidases are widely distributed in nature, a precise understanding of substrate specificity and the mechanisms of substrate binding and catalysis is essential for defining the functions and tracing the evolution of this important group of enzymes. Here, subsite binding energies of barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII have been calculated from kinetic data during the hydrolysis of a series of β-oligoglucoside substrates. The analyses indicate that the enzyme has at least six glucosyl-binding subsites. The catalytic amino acids have been defined, together with their disposition in the substrate-binding region. The substrate specificity, action pattern, putative catalytic residues, and subsite mapping data can all be reconciled with a three-dimensional model of the barley β-glucosidase, which is based on the x-ray crystal structure of an homologous cyanogenic β-glucosidase from white clover (6Barrett T. Suresh C.G. Tolley S.P. Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The glucose diagnostic kit, 4-NPG, gentiobiose, linamarin, bovine serum albumin (BSA), dithiothreitol, glycine ethyl ester (GEE), and orcinol were purchased from Sigma.

(Tokyo, Japan). Barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII was purified from a homogenate of 8-day-old seedlings as described previously (3Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P.

Its purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE, where a single protein band was detected at high protein loadings. The purity was further confirmed by NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis; no secondary sequences were detected, and recoveries were very close to theoretical values (data not shown). Protein determination during the purification process, SDS-PAGE, and amino acid sequence analyses were performed as described previously (3Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P.

Kinetic parameters on (1,4)-β- and (1,3)-β-oligoglucosides were measured at 37 °C by incubating 2–7 pmol of the purified β-glucosidase in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5, containing 160 μg/ml BSA. Initial rates of hydrolysis were determined in triplicate at substrate concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 4 times the K m value. Enzymic reactions were stopped by heating to 100 °C for 2 min, and released glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (7Raabo E. Takildson T.C. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1960; 12: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Standard deviations, which ranged between 1% and 7%, were calculated (8Samuels M.L. Statistics for the Life Sciences. Maxwell Macmillan International Editions/Dallen Publishing Co., San Francisco1991Google Scholar), and kinetic data were processed by a proportional weighted fit, using a nonlinear regression analysis program based on the Michaelis-Menten model equation (9Perella F. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 174: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The initial enzyme concentration [E]0 was kept very much lower than the initial substrate concentration [S]0, and care was taken to measure initial reactions rates in all cases (10Hrmova M. Garrett T.P.J. Fincher G.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14556-14563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Initial hydrolysis rates of β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII with the synthesized aryl-glycosides 4-NP-β-laminaribioside, 4-NP-β-cellobioside, and 4-NP-β-gentiobioside, and with 4-NPG as substrates, were measured at 1 mm concentration. Substrate solutions were prepared in 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, using Δε (300 nm) of 1.104m−1 cm−1 to measure concentrations, and were incubated with 4–5 pmol of the purified β-glucosidase at 37 °C. Enzyme activity was determined reductometrically by monitoring the increase in reducing sugars or spectrophotometrically at 410 nm with 4-NPG (3Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P.

One unit of activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to release 1 μmol of glucose from aryl-glycosides or to release 1 μmol of 4-nitrophenol from 4-NPG per min. One unit corresponds to 16.67 nanokatals. Activity on linamarin was measured as described by Barrett et al.(6Barrett T. Suresh C.G. Tolley S.P. Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Subsite affinities of β-glucosidase were calculated from Michaelis constants (K m ) and catalytic rate constants (k cat) during the hydrolysis of (1,4)-β-oligoglucosides of DP 2–6. In addition, the affinities of subsites +2 and +3 for (1,3)-β-linked oligoglucosides were calculated using K m and k cat values obtained with (1,3)-β-oligoglucosides of DP 2–4. The calculation procedures, using equations for the subsite analysis of exo-acting enzymes (11Hiromi K. Nitta Y. Numata C. Ono S. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 302: 362-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) but using subsite designations from −1 to +1, +2, etc., are summarized below. Consider an active site consisting of x subsites, labeled −1, +1, … to (x − 1). The subsite affinityA i of the subsite labeled i (1 <i ≤ (x − 1)) can be calculated from Equation 1. An=∑i=−1nAi−∑i=−1n−1Ai=RT[ln(kcat/Km)n+1−ln(kcat/Km)n]Equation 1 ∑i =−1n(Ai) and ∑i =−1n −1(Ai) represent the sums of subsite affinities for subsites labeled from −1 to n and n − 1, respectively. The parameters (k cat/K m ) n +1and (k cat/K m ) n are determined for oligosaccharides of DP n + 1 andn, respectively; R is the gas constant, andT is the absolute temperature. The valuesA −1 and k int are extrapolated from a plot of exp( An/RT ) versus(1/k cat) n . exp(An/RT)=[kint/(kcat)n−1]·exp(A−1/RT)Equation 2 The vertical and horizontal intercepts of this equation are −exp( A −1/ RT ) and 1/k int. The parameterk int is the intrinsic catalytic rate constant, which is independent of DP. Finally, A +1 is calculated from Equation 3. A+1=RT ln[(kcat/Km)n/0.018·kint)]−[A−1+A+2+…+An−1]Equation 3 The validity of the subsite map was subsequently confirmed by comparing the experimental and theoreticalk cat/K m values.

The reaction was stopped by heating to 100 °C for 2 min. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were separated by thin layer chromatography on Kieselgel 60 thin layer plates and developed in ethyl acetate/acetic acid/H2O (5:2:1, by volume). Reducing sugars were detected using the orcinol reagent (12Hrmova M. Fincher G.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 289: 453-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Individual products were scraped off the plates, eluted from the Kieselgel with water, and their relative abundance determined spectrophotometrically at 300 nm using Δε of 1.104m−1 cm−1. For structural analysis of the transglycosylation products, the reaction mixtures were scaled up 5 times and products were separated by descending paper chromatography on Whatman no. 3MM paper in ethyl acetate/acetic acid/H2O (3:2:1, by volume) at ambient temperature. The products were excised from the chromatogram, eluted from the paper with water, concentrated under reduced pressure, and analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer Sciex PAI 300 electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin Elmer Sciex Instruments, Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) and by 13C NMR spectroscopy. 13C NMR spectra of oligosaccharides (3–8 μmol) were measured on a Varian Gemini 300 multinuclear spectrometer using 5-mm external diameter sample tubes at a probe temperature of 297 K. Transients (32Rixon J.E. Ferreira L.M.A. Durrant A.J. Laurie J.I. Hazlewood G.P. Gilbert H.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 947-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) were collected into 16,000 data points using a spectral width of 4.5 KHz and a relaxation delay of 3 s with a 45° pulse width. No Gaussian weight factor or line broadening was applied to the data before Fourier transformation. Spectra were referenced and chemical shifts (ppm) were given using sodium 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid as an external standard. Inactivation of β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII was monitored at 37 °C by incubating 57 pmol of purified enzyme in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 160 μg/ml BSA, with 0–10 mm conduritol B epoxide. To stop the inactivation and to determine the residual activity at different times, 5-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture were diluted into 250 μl of 0.2% (w/v) 4-NPG in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 160 μg/ml BSA. The residual enzyme activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 410 nm. First-order rate constants (k app) were determined from the semi-logarithmic plots of residual activity as a function of time, using Equation5. ln(At/A0)=−kapp·tEquation 5 A t and A 0 are enzyme activities at time t and 0, respectively. TheK i and k max constants were determined and the order of the inactivation reaction was estimated (13Levy H.M. Leber P.D. Ryan E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 3654-3659Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to yield a inhibitor:enzyme stoichiometry of 0.7 (± 0.1) (data not shown). β-Glucosidase isoenzyme βII (43 μg) was inactivated at 37 °C by incubating the purified enzyme in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, in the presence of 24 mm conduritol B epoxide; this corresponded to 4.4 times the K i value. The inactivated enzyme, which lost 99% of its activity over 5 h, was concentrated, and excess inhibitor was removed in a microconcentrator (exclusion limit 10,000). Native and conduritol B epoxide-inactivated enzymes were denatured and digested with trypsin, and the resulting tryptic peptides purified by HPLC and sequenced essentially as described by Chen et al.(14Chen L. Fincher G.B. Høj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13318-13326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The tryptic peptide-inhibitor conjugate (20 pmol), which was unique to the conduritol B epoxide-inactivated enzyme, was treated with 20 μl of ammonium hydroxide at 50 °C for 20 min to remove covalently bound conduritol. Excess ammonia was removed under vacuum, and the peptide was again subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence analysis. Purified enzyme (57 pmol) was inactivated with 15 mm1-ethyl-3-(4-azonia-4,4-dimethylpentyl)carbodiimide (EAC) in the presence of 125 mm [14C]GEE, the inactivated enzyme was denatured and digested with trypsin, and the resultant tryptic peptides were purified by HPLC for amino acid sequence analysis (14Chen L. Fincher G.B. Høj P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13318-13326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular mass of the HPLC-purified peptide-inhibitor conjugate was estimated on a Finnigan Lasermat 2000 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Hemel Hempstead, UK). Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) plots were obtained using standard computer software and interpreted as described by Gaboriaud et al. (15Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of the barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII was taken from Leah et al. (2Leah R. Kigel J. Svendsen I. Mundy J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15789-15797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and the sequence of the cyanogenic β-glucosidase from white clover (Trifolium repens) was obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry 1cbg). Co-ordinates for a three-dimensional model of the barley β-glucosidase were obtained using Swiss-Model, the automated protein modeling service of the ExPasy Molecular Biology Server (16Peitsch M.C.

Dodson E.J. Hughes M.A. Structure. 1995; 3: 951-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) (Brookhaven Data Bank entry 1cbg) were supplied as inputs for the program. The three-dimensional model of cellooctaose was constructed from the co-ordinates of cellobiose (19Raymond S. Heyraud A. Tran-Qui D. Krick A. Chanzy H. Macromolecules. 1995; 28 (2010): 2096Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Fitting the cellooctaose model into the active site pocket of the barley β-glucosidase model was performed on a Silicon Graphics Iris Indigo Elan 4000 work station using the GRASP (20Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 4: 281-296Crossref Scopus (5318) Google Scholar) and O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar) software programs. Co-ordinates of the Clostridium thermocellumendoglucanase CelC were obtained from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (entry 1cen; CelCE140Q-Glc6). Protein models and stereoview diagrams were generated with the RasMol software program (22Sayle R. RasMol Version 2.6 Molecular Visualization Program. Glaxo Wellcome Research Development, Stevenage, United Kingdom1996Google Scholar). The relationship between the kinetic parameters (K m, k cat, andk cat/K m ) and the DPs of oligosaccharide substrates of the barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII are shown in Table I. For cellodextrin substrates, K m decreases with increasing chain length of the substrate, whilek cat values appear to be relatively independent of DP, except in the case of cellotriose and to a lesser extent cellotetraose, where k cat values are somewhat lower (Table I). Catalytic efficiency factorsk cat/K m increase steadily with increasing DP of the (1,4)-β-oligoglucoside substrates, again with the exception of cellotriose. Indeed, thek cat/K m value for cellohexaose is 9-fold higher than the value for cellobiose. In marked contrast to the hydrolysis of the cellodextrin series, thek cat andk cat/K m values for laminaridextrins decreased by over 1000-fold and over 130-fold, respectively, as the DP increased from 2 to 4 (Table I). The rate of hydrolysis of laminaripentaose and longer (1,3)-β-oligoglucosides was too low to allow the precise measurement of kinetic parameters. The enzyme had no activity on the cyanogenic substrate, linamarin. Binding energies for the six β-glucosyl binding subsites in the barley β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII during hydrolysis of cellodextrins are compared in Fig. 1. Hrmova et al. (3Hrmova M. Harvey A.J. Wang J. Shirley N.J. Jones G.P. Stone B.A. Høj P.B. Fincher G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5277-5286Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the enzyme catalyzes the hydrolytic removal of glucose units from the non-reducing termini of oligosaccharide chains; this demonstrated that the enzyme is an exohydrolase. It is clear, therefore, that the catalytic amino acids are located between the non-reducing terminal glucosyl-binding subsite and the penultimate subsite; these are designated subsites −1 and +1, respectively (Fig. 1). Binding energies have been expressed in the past as positive or negative values (23Allen J.D. Thoma J.A. Biochem. J. 1976; 159: 121-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 24Suganuma T. Matsuno R. Ohnishi M. Hiromi K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1978; 84: 293-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 25Biely P. Vrsanska M. Claeyssens M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), but we prefer to use positive values to indicate binding (10Hrmova M. Garrett T.P.J. Fincher G.B J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14556-14563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The negative value observed at subsite +2 indicates that there is a degree of repulsion between the enzyme and the glucosyl residue at this subsite. The binding energies at subsites +3, +4, and +5 are positive, but decrease in magnitude as the distance from the catalytic site increases (Fig. 1). Although the barley β-glucosidase hydrolyzes laminaribiose at a slightly faster rate than cellobiose, the rate decreases steeply as the DP of the (1,3)-β-oligoglucoside substrates increase (Table I). Calculation of the apparent binding energies of these laminaridextrins to subsites +2 and +3 yielded values of −4.2 and −8.4 kJ·mol−1, consistent with the low affinities andk cat values of the enzyme for laminaritriose and laminaritetraose (Table I). The subsite mapping results (Fig. 1) offer an explanation for the relatively low rate of hydrolysis of cellotriose (Table I). Based on the binding energies of individual subsites, one might anticipate that “non-productive” binding of cellotriose across subsites +1 to +3 would be almost as likely to occur on thermodynamic grounds as would “productive” binding from subsites −1 to +2. Because the non-productive binding does not span the catalytic site, hydrolysis will not occur, but occupation of part of the substrate-binding region would be expected to lower the catalytic rate, and hence the catalytic efficiency (Table I). Non-productive binding of cellotetraose in subsites +1 to +4 might also occur, but to a lesser extent. When the barley β-glucosidase was incubated with 100 mm 4-NPG, the major products were glucose and 4-NP, as expected. However, significant amounts of other, higher molecular weight 4-NP derivatives were visible on thin layer chromatograms (data not shown). When the three most abundant of these were eluted from the plates and analyzed, m/z values of 486.2 or 486.3 were obtained by electrospray mass spectrometry (data not shown). These values correspond to disaccharide derivatives of 4-NP. Chemical shifts obtained for 13C NMR spectroscopy indicated that the disaccharide derivatives were 4-NP-β-laminaribioside, 4-NP-β-cellobioside, and 4-NP-β-gentiobioside (Table II).Table II13 C NMR chemical shifts of aryl-glycosides synthesized by β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII during the glycosyl transfer reaction of 100 mm 4-NPGCompoundCarbonNon-reducing residueResidue carrying the aglycon4-NP-β-laminaribioside1104.1100.5274.773.8376.885.1470.869.1577.377.2662.061.84-NP-β-cellobioside1103.8100.5273.874.4376.475.3470.779.4577.376.7661.961.04-NP-β-gentiobioside1104.0100.5273.874.3376.776.5470.970.4577.176.9661.969.6 Open table in a new tab The relative proportions of individual transglycosylation products are compared in Table III. The 4-NP-β-laminaribioside was the most abundant, but significant levels of 4-NP-β-cellobioside and 4-NP-β-gentiobioside were also detected. This suggests that there is some flexibility in the binding of a glucosyl residue to subsite +1, because the 4-NPG is able to move sufficiently in the active site to present hydroxyls on C atoms 3, 4, or 6 to the bound glycone prior to transfer of that bound glucosyl residue to the 4-NPG (Scheme FSI). The purified transglycosylation products were subsequently used as substrates under standard conditions for hydrolysis. The specific activities of hydrolysis were found to reflect, approximately at least, their relative rates of synthesis under conditions that promote glycosyl transfer reactions (Table III, column 3; cf. column 2).Table IIISummary of properties of glycosyl-transfer and other reaction products produced by β-glucosidase isoenzyme βII during the glycosyl transfer reaction of 100 mm 4-NPGSubstrate or reaction productChromatographic mobility3-aMobilities of aryl-glycosides and other carbohydrates relative to Glc mobility.Distribution after 72 h3-bDistribution of aryl-glycosides and other reaction products in percent of initial substrate concentration.Specific hydrolytic activity3-cSpecific hydrolytic activity of the β-glucosidase at 1 mm concentration of aryl-glycosides.R Glc%units/mg4-NPG2.2240.64-NP-β-laminaribioside1.8102.04-NP-β-cellobioside1.661.24-NP-β-gentiobioside1.430.3Other arylglycosides1.1–1.24NA3-1004Not applicable.Glc148NA3-1004Not applicable.Disaccharides0.4–0.65NA3-1004Not applicable.3-a Mobilities of aryl-glycosides and other carbohydrates relative to Glc mobility.3-b Distribution of aryl-glycosides and other reaction products in percent of initial substrate concentration.3-c Specific hydrolytic activity of the β-glucosidase at 1 mm concentration of aryl-glycosides.3-d Not applicable.

Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). In the last few years, a number of PI3-kinase inhibition strategies have been used that have identified a family of downstream responses that are thought to be regulated by this pathway, including complex actions such as cell growth, differentiation, and movement (2Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). One of the current aims of research in this area is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which PI3-kinases engage the regulatory pathways associated with these responses. The protein kinase PKB has previously been shown to be a ubiquitous target of PI3-kinase regulation in a variety of different contexts (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Very recently, good evidence has been provided that it is a direct molecular target for PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and possibly PtdIns(3,4)P2, the phospholipids whose concentrations most immediately rise on agonist stimulation of PI3-kinases (5Franke T.F.

This has suggested that PKB may be the primary signal transducer in the PI3-kinase signaling pathway, i.e. a role analogous to cAMP-activated protein kinase and the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive Ca2+ channel in their respective pathways. Evidence in favor of this idea comes from studies indicating that PKB can regulate other responses known to be controlled by PI3-kinase, such as glucose uptake/glycogen synthesis (9Kohn A.D.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar). Parallel work has suggested that the small GTPase Rac is also situated in a primary position in the PI3-kinase signaling pathway, since increased guanine nucleotide exchange on Rac is thought to drive PI3-kinase-dependent regulation of the cytoskeleton (known as lamellipodia formation/membrane ruffling) (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar), superoxide formation (13Segal A.W. Abo A. Trends Biochem.

Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). A critical issue in understanding how the PI3-kinase signaling system operates is thus to understand whether PKB and Rac are activated in some form of hierarchy or as independent pathways. We have attempted to address this question in PDGF-stimulated PAE cells, where we have previously established that PI3-kinase-dependent membrane ruffling is dependent upon activation of Rac (16Wennström S.

Inducible Rac PAE cell lines were maintained in F12 nutrient mixture, 10% HI-FBS, 0.3 μg/ml puromycin and 60 μg/ml hygromycin. We generated an inducible CMV promoter following the original development of IPTG-inducible SV40 promoters (18Hu M.C. Davidson N.

This involved the insertion oflac repressor (LacI) binding sequences into the CMV promoter in a fashion whereby they did not significantly attenuate the efficacy of the promoter in the absence of LacI but were able to severely inhibit its action in its presence. Previous work with SV40 promoters indicated this would probably involve the insertion of multiple copies of LacI-binding sites near the TATA box. We used a convenientSacI site in the 2.1-kilobase pair CMV promoter to achieve this (Fig. 1 A; there is another SacI site in the first intron of this promoter which we also exploited to insert further LacI-binding sites). We first constructed a simple transient expression vector, pCMV1-Luc, where expression of luciferase was under the control of the original CMV promoter ((21Chapman B.S. Thayer R.M. Vincent K.A. Haigwood N.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 3979-3986Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) a gift from A. Venkitaraman, LMB, Cambridge; cDNA encoding luciferase was obtained via pGEMLuc; Promega). We then ligated palindromic LacI-binding oligonucleotides (22Sadler J.R. Sasmor H. Betz J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 6785-6789Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar) into the SacI sites of CMV1 under a range of different vector/oligo ratios. The products of the ligation were then used for transient expression in U937 cells together with an expression plasmid for LacI (pCMVlacI; see below). IPTG-inducible luciferase expression was monitored after 8 h in the presence or absence of 15 mm IPTG (Promega Luciferase assay kit). The sequence of the promoter (pCMV3) which gave the highest non-repressed and lowest repressed expression of luciferase is shown in Fig. 1 A. We then added three further LacI-binding sites by ligating the SV40-based intron from pOPI3CAT (Stratagene) downstream of the CMV3 promoter (now denoted CMV3R; this followed advice from D. Wyborski, Stratagene, suggesting that, while not very effective in transient expression assays, this “R fragment” could produce good repression of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter in stable cell lines). The F9-1 promoter driving expression of LacI in p3′SS (Stratagene) was replaced with the CMV1 promoter to increase expression of nucleus-localized LacI ((23Fieck A. Wyborski D.L. Short J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1785-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) pCMVLacI, available from Stratagene). pCMVLacI has a cassette conferring hygromycin resistance; for construction of the cell lines described here, this was replaced with a puromycin resistance cassette (derived from pBSpac (24de la Luna S. Soria I. Pulido D. Ortin J. Jimenez A. Gene (Amst .). 1988; 62: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) to make pCMVLacIpuro). Clonal stable cell lines expressing nuclear-localized LacI were selected with puromycin (0.3 μg/ml) over a period of 8–10 days post-transfection with pCMVLacIpuro and isolated by ring cloning (while puromycin was continuously present in the medium). Clones expressing LacI protein were identified by immuno-cytostaining with a rabbit polyclonal anti-LacI serum (Stratagene) and expanded. One clone showing strong, nuclear-localized LacI expression (P23 PAE) was chosen for further use. All inducible lines described in this work were obtained from P23 PAE by a further round of transfection with pCMV3R(Rac) expression vectors (see below), selection (hygromycin, 60 μg/ml), and cloning. Screening for inducible expression of Rac mutants was done largely by Western blotting using the polyclonal rabbit anti-Rac serum, although in some experiments expression of the EE-tagged Rac mutants was quantified by anti-EE immunoprecipitations from [35S]methionine-labeled cells and SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B) or by Western blot using a mouse mAb anti-Rac1 (Fig. 1 C). Between 4 and 12 individual clones for each Rac mutant were finally selected for expansion and storage. For a number of the experiments presented here, more than one Rac mutant was investigated of each type, with essentially identical results. The cDNAs encoding N-terminally EE-tagged Wt-Rac, N17Rac (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar), and V12Rac (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar) were obtained from ONYX Pharmaceuticals. Standard cloning procedures were used to ligate these cDNAs under the CMV3R promoter (see above) in a vector containing an expression cassette conferring hygromycin resistance (pA71d; a gift from A. Venkitaraman, LMB, Cambridge). The cDNA encoding bovine αPKB (from Boudewijn M. T. Burgering and Paul J. Coffer, Utrecht, The Netherlands) was ligated into a pCMV transient expression vector with either N-terminal EE (MEEEEFMPMEF) or Myc (MEQKLISEEDLEF) tags (generated by standard polymerase chain reaction-based strategies). The single point mutants (R25C, W99L, T308A, T308D, S473A, S473D, and K197A) and the ΔPH(1–125) mutants of PKB were generated by a polymerase chain reaction-based mutagenic strategy using Pfupolymerase (Stratagene) and low cycle numbers (≤16). PLCδPH-PKB was generated using Stratagene's Seamless Cloning Kit®; residues 6–99 of PKB were replaced with residues 7–121 of PLCδ (Roger Williams, LMB, Cambridge), creating a PH domain swap at the conserved C-terminal tryptophan. The resulting construct was ligated into pCMV transient expression vector with either an N-terminal EE or Myc tag. Myrist.-PKB containing the Yes myristoylation consensus at the N terminus (MGLCIKSKEDKSM) (25Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar) and Gag-PKB (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) were ligated into pCMV transient expression vector with C-terminal EE or Myc tags. All constructs were sequenced to verify that they contained no polymerase chain reaction-generated errors. In some experiments, HA-tagged Wt-PKB (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar) was transiently expressed using an SV40 promoter-based expression vector (pSG5, Stratagene). Wt-PAE cells or N17Rac-PAE cells were transfected with pCMV-PKB mutants by electroporation at 250 V and 960 microfarads (1 × 107 cells in 500 μl) essentially as described for U937 cells (26Stephens L.R. Eguinoa A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Lui M. Cooke F.T. Coadwell J. Smrka A. Thelen M. Cadwallader K. Tempst P. Hawkins P.T. Cell. 1997; 89: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were grown on glass coverslips (for immunofluorescence experiments) or in 6-well tissue culture plates (for kinase assay) in F12, 10% HI-FBS for 7–30 h and then serum-starved for 15 h in F12, 1% HI-FBS or F12, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA (see the figure legends). For PKB assays (4Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar), tissue culture dishes were washed twice in 25 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.37 mm KCl, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 112.5 mm NaCl, 25 mm glucose, 1 mm NaHCO3, 0.1% fatty acid-free BSA and left to prewarm in a 37 °C waterbath for 5 min before being stimulated with the indicated concentrations of PDGF for 5 min. In some cases, cells were treated with 100 nmwortmannin (stock in Me2SO) for 10 min at 37 °C prior to activation. After cell activation, the medium was aspirated followed by immediate addition of 1 ml of ice-cold PKB lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 120 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 15 mm sodium pyrophosphate, pH 7.5) and incubation on a gently rocking ice bath for 5 min. Cells were then scraped into Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was precleared with protein G-Sepharose beads (pre-equilibrated in PKB lysis buffer containing 1% BSA) for 30 min and then incubated for 2 h with mAb anti-EE or mAb anti-HA as appropriate (non-covalently pre-coupled to protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose, respectively). The beads were washed 3 times in PKB lysis buffer and twice in 50 mmHepes, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. The reaction was carried out in a final volume of 50 μl in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm MgATP, 2 μm cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor (Sigma), 10 μg of myelin basic protein, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP at 30 °C for 20 min. It was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE, and γ-32P-labeled myelin basic protein was visualized and quantified with a Bio-Rad phosphorimager. In experiments where the activities of several different EE-tagged PKB mutants were measured, their expression levels were compared in parallel by Western blotting. For this, the transfected cells were grown and serum-starved under the same conditions as those for the PKB assay. Then, equal numbers of cells from each transfection were solubilized in Laemmli SDS sample buffer, proteins separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, tranferred to nitrocellulose, and blotted with mAb anti-EE. Expression of the PKB mutants was visualized by the standard ECL procedure. Autofluorograms were densitometrically scanned with a Bio-Rad Gel Doc 1000 system and quantified with the Bio-Rad Molecular Analyst program to estimate the differences in expression levels. The PKB activity of each mutant was then corrected for its average expression level in all presented experiments. For p70S6K assays (27Wilson M. Burt A.R. Milligan G. Anderson N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8537-8540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the cells were activated, and solubilization was done as described for PKB assays except that the p70S6K lysis buffer was made of 55 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 132 mmNaCl, 22 mm NaF, 1.1 mm EDTA, 5.5 mm EGTA, 11 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1% Nonidet P-40. The solubilized material was precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads (pre-equilibrated in p70S6K lysis buffer containing 1% BSA) for 30 min, incubated for 2 h on ice with rabbit polyclonal anti-p70S6K antibody, and then with pre-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were washed twice in ice-cold p70S6K lysis buffer and twice in “p70S6K buffer” (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 20 mm para-nitrophenol phosphate). The samples were prewarmed to 30 °C for 3 min in 50 μl of p70S6K buffer containing 2.5 μm cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor and 3.5 μg of 32-mer p70S6K substrate peptide. The reaction was started by addition of 10 μl “ATP solution” per sample (80 mmMgCl2, 200 μm MgATP, and 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP). Incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 15 min and stopped by the addition of orthophosphoric acid to a final concentration of 200 mm. Samples were spotted onto Whatman P81 paper, washed 6 × 5 min in 175 mm orthophosphoric acid, and quantified by scintillation β-counting. Cells for immunofluorescence microscopy were grown on glass coverslips and serum-starved as described above. They were then pretreated or not with 100 nm wortmannin for 10 min and stimulated with the indicated concentrations of PDGF for 5 min at 37 °C. Activation was stopped by aspirating the medium and immediate addition of 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm Pipes, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were washed three times in 150 mm Tris, pH 7.2, permeabilized for 10 min at room temperature in PBS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and then washed twice in PBS. In some experiments, filamentous actin was directly labeled with TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma; 1:100–1:400 dilution of 200 μg/ml stock in methanol) in PBS, O.5% BSA for 1 h at 37 °C. In other experiments, the coverslips were first blocked with PBS, O.5% BSA for 20 min at room temperature and then incubated with an appropriate dilution of mAb-anti-Myc (1:100) or anti-PKB antibody (1:400) for 1 h at 37 °C. The coverslips were washed 4 × for 5 min in PBS, O.5% BSA and then incubated with an appropriate dilution (usually 1:100) of secondary antibody fluorescein isothiocyanate goat anti-mouse or fluorescein isothiocyanate-goat anti-rabbit (both Sigma) and TRITC-phalloidin (as above) concomitantly. Coverslips were washed 3 × for 5 min in PBS, O.5% BSA, 5 min in PBS, and then in H2O before being mounted onto microscope slides with Aqua-polymount anti-fading solution (PolySciences Inc., Northampton, UK). To investigate the role of Rac in the PI3-kinase signaling pathway, we have generated stable PAE cell lines that inducibly express Wt-Rac (CL-25), constitutively active V12Rac (CL-84), or dominant negative N17Rac (CL-23), using a strategy that is detailed under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). These cell lines expressed low basal levels of the exogenous Rac mutants (≤10% of endogenous Rac) but, in all cases, the expression increased dramatically upon addition of increasing concentrations of IPTG (Fig. 1, B andC). The sensitivity of induction to IPTG varied between individual clones, but the maximal level of expression of heterologous Rac was between approximately 5-fold (CL-23 N17Rac line) and approximately 20-fold (CL-25 Wt-Rac line) above endogenous Rac levels (Fig. 1 C). Wt-PAE cells respond to PDGF treatment with dramatic formation of lamellipodia (protrusions of the cell that look like large flat pseudopods) and membrane ruffles (areas at the edges of lamellipodia where the plasma membrane detaches from the support and rolls up upon itself). This “ruffling response” is dependent on a wortmannin-sensitive PI3-kinase (16Wennström S. Hawkins P.T. Cooke F.T. Hara K. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Jackson T. Claesson-Welsh L. Stephens L. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 385-393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). In parental Wt-PAE cells, the ruffling response was unaffected by addition of up to 15 mmIPTG for 15 h (Fig. 2; a typical lamellipodium with membrane ruffles is marked with anarrowhead). When N17Rac expression was induced with 15 mm IPTG in the cell line CL-23, PDGF-stimulated lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling were severely attenuated (Fig. 2; CL-23 cells clearly ruffle in response to PDGF in the absence of IPTG). These results are in close agreement with previously published work using microinjection or transient expression of Rac mutants (12Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L. Diekmann D. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 401-410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3041) Google Scholar) showing that Rac activity is necessary for the ruffling response. However, whereas the PI3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin completely reversed any apparent effect of PDGF on the actin cytoskeleton, N17Rac expression blocked lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling, but the cells still exhibited clear PDGF-stimulated “boundary actin” polymerization and microspike formation (Fig. 2; a typical microspike is marked with an arrow). These results suggest that Rac may not be the only mediator of PI3-kinase-controlled effects on the actin cytoskeleton. IPTG-induced Wt-Rac or V12Rac expression in the CL-25 and CL-84 cell lines, respectively, caused a dramatic formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles around the entire periphery of the cells (Fig. 2). This response was seen even in the absence of PDGF, showing that Rac activation is a sufficient signal to cause these rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Wt-Rac or V12Rac-induced lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling were not inhibited by wortmannin, confirming previous findings that Rac is situated downstream of PI3-kinase in this PDGF-stimulated pathway (17Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar, 28Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3682) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Wt-Rac has been suggested to activate Rac-dependent pathways by escaping the normal regulatory constraint of binding to guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (17Hawkins P.T. Eguinoa A. Qiu R.-G. Stokoe D. Cooke F.T. Walters R. Wennström S. Claesson-Welsh L. Evans T. Symons M. Stephens L.R. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), and may be a less extreme way of Rac activation than expressing V12Rac. Indeed, we observed that a large number of inducible V12Rac-PAE-cell clones exhibited some basal lamellipodia formation in the absence of IPTG and detectable V12Rac expression on Western blots (Figs. 1 C and2), suggesting that V12Rac is a very potent activator of Rac-dependent responses. Earlier reports have shown that both PKB and p70S6K are downstream targets of PI3-kinase (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar), and studies using transient transfection of fibroblasts with N17Rac and p70S6K have indicated that Rac mediates the activation of p70S6K by PDGF (30Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). We used the inducible Rac-PAE cell lines to study the effects of Wt-Rac, V12Rac, and N17Rac expression on the PDGF-stimulated activation of PKB and p70S6K in PAE cells (Fig. 3). In parental PAE cells, PDGF stimulated PKB and p70S6Kactivation was about 10- and 2.5-fold over basal, respectively, and the activation of both enzymes was wortmannin-sensitive. The level of PDGF-stimulated p70S6K activation in CL-23 and CL-84 cells was only similar to that in parental cells as long as the cells were not treated with IPTG (Fig. 3 A); IPTG-induced N17Rac expression significantly inhibited PDGF-stimulated p70S6K activation, whereas V12Rac expression led to p70S6K activation even in the absence of PDGF (Fig. 3 A). These results confirm those obtained earlier in fibroblasts that Rac has a regulatory input into the PDGF-stimulated activation of p70S6K (30Chou M.M. Blenis J. Cell. 1996; 85: 573-583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). However, while wortmannin treatment of PAE cells inhibited p70S6K activation completely, N17Rac expression reproducibly led to only a 60% inhibition (Fig. 3 A; basal activity = 37.5 ± 1.1 (arbitrary units); PDGF-stimulated activity in the absence of IPTG = 93.0 ± 0.7 and in the presence of IPTG = 60.9 ± 0.7). This level of inhibition was identical at submaximal doses of PDGF and at varying doses of IPTG (Fig. 3 A and data not shown), suggesting that the partial inhibition was not due to insufficient expression of N17Rac. Therefore, it seems likely that Rac is not the sole mediator of PDGF-stimulated p70S6Kactivation. Furthermore, p70S6K activation is not required for PDGF-stimulated lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling, as rapamycin, a p70S6K inhibitor, has no effect on this response (data not shown). The level of PDGF-stimulated PKB activation in the cell lines CL-23, CL-25, and CL-84 was similar to that in parental cells, regardless of whether the expression of N17Rac, Wt-Rac, or V12Rac had been induced with IPTG or not (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, Rac does not seem to mediate the PDGF-stimulated activation of PKB in PAE cells. Recent work has suggested that PKB may be a direct target of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 via the binding of the lipid to its PH domain (3Franke T.F. Yang S.-I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K.

Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). The EGFR also binds other ligands that contain amino acid sequences classified as the EGF-like motif. Among these ligands, the three-dimensional structures of EGF and transforming growth factor α (TGFα) have been determined by NMR (2Campbell I.D. Cooke R.M. Baron M. Harvey T.S. Tappin M.J. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1989; 1: 13-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Upon binding of the ligand to the extracellular domain, the EGFR undergoes dimerization, which eventually leads to the activation of its cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinase (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). The EGFR is also known as the ErbB-1 receptor and belongs to the type I family of receptor tyrosine kinases (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). This group also includes the ErbB-2, ErbB-3, and ErbB-4 receptors. The ligand of ErbB-2 is still unknown but that of ErbB-3 and ErbB-4 is heregulin (3Plowman G.D. Green J.M. Culouscou J.-M. Carlton G.W. Rothwell V.M. Buckley S. Nature. 1993; 366: 473-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). This factor is also known as neuregulin or NDF and contains an EGF-like sequence that was found to fold into an EGF-like fold by NMR (4Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S.

The type II family of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of the insulin receptor (INSR), the insulin-like growth factor I receptor, and the insulin receptor-related receptor (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar). Although the type II receptors have a very different quaternary structure (tetrameric α2β2) from that of the type I receptors (monomeric α), the extracellular portions of the two families, as well as the tyrosine kinase portions, share significant sequence homology, suggesting a common evolutionary origin (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar, 6Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The 621 amino acid residues of the extracellular domain of the human EGFR (sEGFR) can be subdivided into four domains as follows: L1, S1, L2, and S2, where L and S stand for “large” and “small” domains, respectively (Ref. 6Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, see Fig. 2). L1 (residues 1–165) and L2 (residues 310–481) are homologous and are also known as domain I and domain III. Domain III (L2) is the major ligand-binding domain, since the isolated L2 domain can bind EGF and TGFα with an affinity similar to sEGFR (7Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A.

L1 may have much weaker affinity for ligands, but this interaction should be important in ligand-mediated receptor dimerization (8Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I.

The number of cysteines and the spacings between the cysteines are conserved among the members of the EGFR and INSR families (6Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Weaker, but significant, homologies were detected in other cysteine-rich sequences of furin (9Roebroek A.J.M.

Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The S1 and S2 domains of the EGFR appear to be arranged as three repeats of eight cysteines (6Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 916: 220-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), but information other than sequence homology is necessary to improve the analysis of the EGFR and INSR cysteine-rich sequences. Ligand-induced dimerization was first reported for the EGF receptor (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4619) Google Scholar) and now is widely accepted as a general mechanism for the transmission of growth stimulatory signals across the cell membrane. Although many biochemical experiments have been performed to reveal the molecular mechanism of receptor dimerization (8Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M.

Single particle averaging of electron microscopic images showed that the overall shape of the sEGFR is four-lobed and doughnut-like (12Lax I. Mitra A.K. Ravera C. Hurwitz D.R. Rubinstein M.

Small angle x-ray scattering suggested that the sEGFR is a flattened sphere with long diameters of 110 Å and a short diameter of 20 Å (8Lemmon M.A. Bu Z. Ladbury J.E. Zhou M. Pinchasi D. Lax I. Engelman D.M. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 281-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The crystallization of sEGFR in complex with EGF was published (13Günther N. Betzel C. Weber W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22082-22085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the structure has not yet been reported, despite a decade of effort by many groups. Therefore, we have started a more fundamental characterization of the EGFR, which will eventually lead to the structure determination. In this report, we describe the connections of the 25 disulfide bonds in the extracellular domain of human EGFR. These disulfide linkage data were essential to analyze the repeat structure of the two cysteine-rich domains of the EGFR. We concluded that the cysteine-rich repeat of EGFR is a new member of the laminin-type EGF-like (LE) motif. The extracellular domain of human EGFR (sEGFR) was produced by overexpression using Chinese hamster ovary cells, as described (7Kohda D. Odaka M. Lax I. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1976-1981Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Concentrated serum-free conditioned medium was dialyzed in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.1 (buffer A), and then loaded on tandem-connected, buffer A-equilibrated columns of DEAE-Toyopearl 650S (inner diameter, 1 × 10 cm, Tosoh), CM-Toyopearl 650S (inner diameter, 1 × 10 cm, Tosoh), and Affi-Gel Blue Gel (inner diameter, 1 × 4 cm, Bio-Rad). The sEGFR was not retained by the DEAE and CM columns and was absorbed by the Affi-Gel Blue resin. The protein was eluted from the disconnected Affi-Gel Blue column with a linear gradient of 0.05 to 2 mNaCl in buffer A. The eluant containing sEGFR (∼2 mg/ml) was stored at −20 °C until use. A 400-μl aliquot of a 6,6′-dithionicotinic acid solution (Wako Pure Chemical, saturated in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, containing 8 mguanidine HCl) was mixed with 100 μl of sample solution. The absorbance at 345 nm was measured. For calibration, 2-mercaptoethanol was used. The stock solution of sEGFR was desalted by gel filtration chromatography on a G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with 10% acetic acid. After lyophilization, the protein (1∼5 mg) was dissolved in 100 μl of 70% formic acid and was mixed with 100 μg of cyanogen bromide. The reaction mixture was gently stirred overnight at room temperature. After the addition of 900 μl of H2O, the cyanogen bromide was removed by lyophilization. Peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC on a Pegasil C4 (120 Å, inner diameter 4.6 × 150 mm, Senshu Scientific Co.) column using an LC-10A system (Shimadzu) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A linear gradient was applied using solvent A containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 80% acetonitrile. The purified cyanogen bromide fragments were further cleaved overnight at 37 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, by various proteases, includingl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (Sigma), V8 protease (Wako), and elastase (Boehringer Mannheim). The digestion by 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone-treated chymotrypsin (Sigma) was carried out under the same conditions, except at pH 6.5. The digestion by lysyl endoproteinase (alias Achromobacterprotease I, Wako) was done overnight at 30 °C and at pH 6.0 in the presence of 2 m urea. The digestion by prolyl endopeptidase (Seikagaku Corp.) was done for 1 h at 37 °C and at pH 6.5. In all cases, the ratio of the peptide to the protease was 10:1 (w/w). The purified proteolytic fragments were treated with neuraminidase (also known as sialidase, Boehringer Mannheim), glycopeptidase A (Seikagaku Corp.), or endoglycosidase F/N-glycanase F (Boehringer Mannheim). The lyophilized glycopeptidase A powder was dissolved in 500 μl of H2O and was stored at −20 °C. The peptide solution (100 μg/10 μl in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) was mixed with 1 μl of the neuraminidase stock solution, and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. For the glycopeptidase A digestion, the peptide solution (10 μg/10 μl in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0) was mixed with 10 μl of the glycopeptidase A stock solution, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The peptide solution (10 μg/10 μl in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 5.0, containing 25 mm sodium citrate, 25 mm NaCl, and 0.05% SDS) was mixed with 10 μl of the endoglycosidase F/N-glycanase F stock solution, and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. Peptides were sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 492 Protein Sequencer. The Edman degradation in the Applied Biosystems sequencer did not yield a phenylthiohydantoin (PTH) derivative from a half-cystine residue until its other half was also released (14Marti T. Rösselet S.J. Titani K. Walsh K.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8099-8109Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Thus, no PTH derivative is seen at the first cysteine of a cystine, and the di-PTH of cystine is detected after the second cysteine is released. The di-PTH-cystine elutes near the PTH-tyrosine position. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopic analyses were carried out using a Voyager Elite spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). The accelerating voltage was set to 20 kV. Data were acquired in the positive linear mode of operation. Spectra were externally calibrated with angiotensin II (m/z 1046.19, Sigma) and myoglobin from horse heart (m/z 16950.70, Sigma). Protein solutions were mixed with an equal volume of matrix solution (3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile, 2:1 v/v). For peptides with molecular weights <5,000, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid saturated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile (1:1 v/v) was used as the matrix solution. Analyses of disulfide-linked peptides were facilitated by spontaneous cleavage of the disulfide bonds during the MALDI-MS measurements (15Patterson S.D. Katta V. Anal. Chem. 1994; 66: 3727-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 16Crimmins D.L. Saylor M. Rush J. Thoma R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 226: 355-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Pseudomolecular ions corresponding to reduced forms of the peptides were observed in addition to the molecular ion at the laser fluence above the threshold. Protein sequences were obtained from release 34 of the SWISS-PROT data base (17Bairoch A. Boeckmann B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2247-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). The sequence alignment was done by the program ClustalW (18Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar), and final adjustments were made manually. Secondary structure predictions were performed using the programs PredictProtein (19Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1342) Google Scholar), GOR (20Garnier J.

Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5610) Google Scholar) were used for collecting information on cysteine-rich motifs. Homology modeling was done using Quanta96/Protein Design (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The sequences were aligned manually using the Sequence Viewer. The first criterion for aligning sequences was to match the conserved cysteine residues. Gaps were inserted to equalize the lengths of the inter-cysteine spacings. The dissimilarities between noncysteine residues were not considered seriously. Matched residues were selected manually, and the coordinates for the matched residues were copied from a known structure to generate a framework of a homology model. The model at this stage contained missing coordinates for atoms of some side chains and peptide segments that have no counterpart. The tools in the model backbone palette, “Regularizing Regions” and “Search Fragment Data base,” were used to find appropriate values for unknown coordinates. Then the side chain conformations were refined automatically with the tools in the model side chains palette. After connection of disulfide bonds with the CHARMm/RTF option, the model structure was subjected to energy minimization of CHARMm in the RTF mode. The model of S22 was built first on the basis of the laminin γ1III4 structure (1TLE, model 2). The models of other repeats were constructed on the basis of the S22 model structure. The relative orientations of the repeats were modeled after the manner of the laminin γ1III3–5 structure (1KLO). The helix conformation between S11 and S12 was set by the tool in the model backbone palette, “Apply Conformation.” The recombinant extracellular domain of the human EGF receptor was purified from Chinese hamster ovary cell culture conditioned medium. Fifty mg of protein were recovered from 3 liters of conditioned medium. N-terminal sequencing confirmed the signal cleavage site after residue Ala24 in the uncleaved protein. Therefore, the numbering starts with Leu25 in the uncleaved protein as residue 1 in the cleaved protein (see Fig. 2). The extracellular domain of the EGFR (sEGFR) contains 50 cysteines. Free sulfhydryls were measured with 6,6′-dithionicotinic acid under acidic pH conditions in the presence of 8 m guanidine HCl. The absence of an increase of absorption at 345 nm indicated the presence of less than 0.1 mol of free SH group/mol of the protein. The sEGFR molecule behaves as a monomer under nondenaturing conditions (26Odaka M. Kohda D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Inagaki F. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 122: 116-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), indicating an absence of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Therefore all 50 cysteine residues in the sEGFR are involved in 25 intramolecular disulfide bonds. To map the disulfide bonds, sEGFR, without reduction and deglycosylation, was cleaved by cyanogen bromide at the methionyl peptide bonds and was separated by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 A). Note that all of the fractions, except for C1, gave broad and multiple peaks owing to the attached carbohydrate chains. Each fraction was analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS (Table I). Intensive enzymatic deglycosylation was carried out prior to the MALDI-MS analyses to obtain the correct masses of the peptides without the carbohydrate chains. The two cysteines, Cys7and Cys34, were located in the fragment of peak C4. Disulfide bond formation was confirmed by the observation of di-PTH-cystine at the seventh cycle of Edman degradation. The remaining cysteine residues were contained in peak C3, which was treated with glycopeptidase A for the (only partial) removal of the carbohydrate chains and then was digested by lysyl endoproteinase. The resultant peptide mixture was separated by the second reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1 B). Analyses of 12 of the 17 peaks revealed the existence of five disulfide bonds. Each fraction contained one disulfide bond at most; hence, the identification of each disulfide linkage was straightforward. The other five peaks were processed further by various proteases to obtain fragments containing fewer disulfide bonds. Since peak C3-L15 had a very broad shape, suggesting a high content of carbohydrate, the fraction was treated with neuraminidase and then with glycosidase F/N-glycanase prior to tryptic digestion.Table IPeptide mapping analysis using N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS and identification of disulfide bonds in human EGF receptorView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)1-a The definition of peak names is described in Fig. 1.1-b Amino acid residues in capital letters indicate the results of N-terminal sequencing; those in lowercase letters denote amino acids deduced from the sequence.

During the analyses after the third fragmentation, nine disulfide bonds were positively identified, since each fragment contained only one disulfide bond. If a fragment contained more than one disulfide bond, the assignment was slightly complicated. For example, peak C3-L7-P1 contained four cysteines in three peptides. The three peptides must be linked by two disulfide bonds to one another, since the mass peak corresponding to the sum of the three peptides was observed in the MALDI-MS spectrum. Thus, there remained two possible disulfide linkages (Scheme FS1). Di-PTH-cystine was observed at the fifth and seventh cycles of the Edman degradation, clearly demonstrating that the combination on the left was correct. If the combination on the right had been correct, then di-PTH-cystine would have been observed at the second cycle, instead of the fifth. Another example was found in peak C3-L10-TE3. This peak comprised three peptide chains, but only two chains were found during the N-terminal sequencing. The mass value obtained by the prompt fragmentation during MALDI-MS showed that the third peptide was Gln193-Ser196, but it must have been dehydrated (Table I). This anomaly is probably due to the formation of pyroglutamic acid at the N-terminal glutamine residue of the third peptide. Attempts to remove the pyroglutamic acid by pyroglutamate aminopeptidase (Boehringer Mannheim), however, were unsuccessful. The observation of di-PTH-cystine at the sixth cycle of the Edman degradation indicated the disulfide bond connection as in Table I. Peak C3-L12-E2 was subjected to the fourth fragmentation by chymotrypsin and subsequently by prolyl endopeptidase to generate only one peak, C3-L12-E2-CP1, containing two disulfide bonds. Peaks C3-L15-T1 and C3-L15-T2 were derived from the second cysteine-rich domain and therefore contained many cysteine residues. Repeated intensive digestions using less specific proteases, such as elastase and prolyl endopeptidase, were necessary to obtain fragments with one or two disulfide bonds. After the fourth and fifth fragmentations, seven disulfide bonds were identified eventually (Table I). In summary, 338 residues were confirmed by N-terminal sequencing, accounting for 54% of the sEGFR residues. The recovered peptide fragments identified by the combination of N-terminal sequencing and MALDI-MS contained a total of 524 residues, accounting for 84% of the sEGFR. The rest of the residues were ascribed to peptides that were difficult to isolate, due to their small size (<5 residues). Some long peptides were not analyzed simply because they did not have disulfide bonds. All but one of the disulfide bonds were positively identified by the Edman degradation. The last disulfide bond, between Cys212 and Cys224, was assigned by elimination because of the unsuccessful recovery of the fragment containing the disulfide bond (see the line labeled as “missing” in Table I). It is likely that the peptide fragment became very small after the intensive digestion with elastase, which is less specific. The disulfide bonds in the recombinant human EGF receptor have been determined by a combination of N-terminal sequencing and mass spectroscopy. Peptide cleavage, deglycosylation, and purification were carried out at acidic pH values and under nonreducing conditions to prevent disulfide scrambling. No indication of disulfide rearrangement was observed during the analysis. The combination of all 25 intramolecular disulfide linkages in the EGF receptor is summarized in Fig. 2. Domains L1 and L2 (domains I and III, respectively) have homologous amino acid sequences, and each contains four conserved cysteines. The disulfide pairing pattern in the L domains was found to be 1–2,3–4. Domains S1 and S2 (domains II and IV, respectively) are also homologous and contain many cysteines, i.e. 22 in S1 and 20 in S2. The 11 disulfide bonds in S1 are arranged into three units of a 1–3,2–4 pattern and five units of a 1–2 pattern, and the 10 disulfides in S2 are arranged into three units of a 1–3,2–4 pattern and four units of a 1–2 pattern. The cysteine-rich sequences of EGFR and INSR are classified into the furin Cys-rich motif group (23Bork P. Bairoch A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: C02Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Some members, but not all, of the mammalian subtilisin-related proteases that cleave precursor proteins at dibasic sequences, such as furin and PACE4, contain many repeats of eight cysteines (10Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Steiner D.F. Smeekens S.P. Ohagi S. Chan S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23435-23438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A relationship between the EGFR Cys-rich repeat and the laminin-type EGF-like repeat was also pointed out, and the disulfide bonding pattern was predicted based on the working hypothesis that the eight cysteine repeat appeared to be a chimera of a TNF receptor repeat and an EGF-like repeat (10Ward C.W. Hoyne P.A. Flegg R.H. Proteins. 1995; 22: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, this prediction is correct despite the rough assumption, except for two disulfide bonds in the segment of residues 287–309. They suggested a 1–4,2–3 pairing pattern, i.e.Cys287-Cys309 and Cys302-Cys305, but in fact, Cys287-Cys302 and Cys305-Cys309 are the correct combinations. The internal sequence homology and the domain arrangement, L1-S1-L2-S2, suggests evolution through gene duplication of the L-S prototype unit. For example, a Cys-Trp-Gly stretch and a Gly-Cys-Thr-Gly-Pro stretch are seen in both S domains (Fig. 3). Among the members of the EGFR families, the Drosophila andCaenorhabditis elegans homologues of the human EGF receptors have longer sequences in the S2 domain, which contains five repeats of eight cysteine residues (see Fig. 4 B, TOP_DROME and LT23_CAEEL). The extra cysteine-rich sequences might be a result of further duplication (6Bajaj M. Waterfield M.D. Schlessinger J. Taylor W.R. Blundell T. Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W2119725736,"Hirschsprung's disease (HSCR) is a congenital intestinal disease, characterized by the absence of ganglion cells in the distal portion of the intestinal tract. Recently, three susceptibility genes have been identified in HSCR, namely theRET protooncogene, the endothelin B (ETB) receptor gene (EDNRB), and the endothelin-3 (ET-3) gene (EDN3). To investigate whether mutations inEDNRB could be related with HSCR in non-inbred populations in Japan, we examined alterations of the gene in 31 isolated patients. Three novel mutations were detected as follows: two transversions, A to T and C to A at nucleotides 311 (N104I) and 1170 (S390R), respectively, and a transition, T to C at nucleotide 325 (C109R). To analyze functions of these mutant receptors, they were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. S390R mutation did not change the binding affinities but caused the decreases in the ligand-induced increment of intracellular calcium and in the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity, showing the impairment of the intracellular signaling. C109R receptors were proved to be localized near the nuclei as an unusual 44-kDa protein with the extremely low affinity to endothelin-1 (ET-1) and not to be translocated into the plasma membrane. On the other hand, N104I receptors showed almost the same binding affinities and functional properties as those of the wild type. Therefore, we conclude that S390R and C109R mutations could cause HSCR but that N104I mutation might be polymorphous.

Endothelins (ETs) are a family of 21 amino acid vasoactive peptides, consisting of three isopeptides, ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3, that act on G protein-coupled receptors, ETA and ETB (7Yanagisawa M.

ETA exhibits different affinities to the three isopeptides in the order of ET-1 ≥ ET-2 ≫ ET-3. ETB accepts all three isopeptides equally. These receptors regulate multiple effector pathways, for example, phospholipase C via Gq, and adenylyl cyclase via Gs in smooth muscle cells (ETA), and via Gi in endothelial cells (ETB) (12Rubanyi G.M.

Mice with targeted null disruption of either Ednrb or Edn3 exhibit an identical phenotype, coat color spotting, and aganglionic megacolon, similar to HSCR or Shah-Waardenburg syndrome in humans (14Hosoda K.

To investigate whether mutations in EDNRB are related with HSCR in non-inbred populations in Japan, we examined alterations of the gene in 31 patients and analyzed functional properties of the mutant ETB receptors. LipofectAMINE and Trizol were from Life Technologies, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). ET-1 and ET-3 were from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). 125I-NaI was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA), and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 was from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). cAMP radioimmunoassay kit was from Yamasa (Chiba, Japan). Fura-2/AM was from Dojin Chemicals Institute Co. (Kumamoto, Japan). Platelet activating factor, Geneticin, forskolin, (p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were from Wako Chemicals (Osaka). Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP DNA sequencing kit was from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Western blot chemiluminescence reagent was from NEN Life Science Products. Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to each exon of EDNRB were designed according to the sequences of the intron-exon junctions (25Arai H. Nakao K. Takaya K. Hosoda K. Ogawa Y. Nakanishi S.

The genomic DNAs were isolated from whole blood by a phenol/chloroform extraction protocol described elsewhere (26Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar). One-μl aliquots of the PCR products were mixed with 23 μl of a loading solution containing 96% deionized formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue. After denaturation at 80 °C for 10 min, 20 μl were applied to a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 25 mmTris and 192 mm glycine. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C for 5–8 h at 400 V with a 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine buffer, followed by silver staining. Agarose gel-purified PCR products were subcloned into M13 vector (26Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.14-9.23Google Scholar). The sequence was determined with Sequenase 7-deaza-dGTP DNA sequencing kit. To construct the cDNAs coding the mutant hETB receptors by cassette mutagenesis (27Wells J.A. Vasser M. Powers D.B. Gene (Amst .). 1985; 34: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), we used SRα promoter-based mammalian expression vector pME18Sf−, which carried a cDNA construct encoding the wild-type hETB receptor (28Sakamoto A. Yanagisawa M. Sawamura T. Enoki T. Ohtani T. Sakurai T. Nakao K. Toyo-Oka T. Masaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8547-8553Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. A. Sakamoto, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, Saitama, Japan). Mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotide cassettes were created by recombinant PCR with primers (see Fig. 1) (29Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing the cDNAs encoding the wild-type hETB receptor and the mutated cassette fragments were treated with the unique cognate restriction enzymes and then ligated (Fig. 1). The mutant plasmids were identified by restriction analysis and verified by automated DNA sequencing. CHO and Ltk− cells were maintained in minimum essential medium α and minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, respectively. The cDNAs of the wild-type and the mutant hETB receptors were transfected into CHO or Ltk− cells in 24-well plates using LipofectAMINE. At 48–72 h after transfection, the cells were used for the binding assay. Each expression plasmid was cotransfected with pSV2neo plasmid into CHO cells as described above. Clonal cell lines resistant to Geneticin (0.5 mg/ml) were isolated by colony lifting and screened for the presence of specific125I-ET-1 binding. The cells were scraped in buffer A (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 3 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 μm(p-amidinophenyl)methanesulfonyl fluoride, 5 μm pepstatin A, 1 μm bestatin, 10 μm leupeptin) and homogenized by a Potter-Elvehjem homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 1 h at 4 °C at 100,000 × g for Western blot analysis or at 20,000 × g for membrane binding experiments. 125I-ET-1 was prepared as described before (30Yorimitsu K. Shinmi O. Nishiyama M. Moroi K. Sugita Y. Saito T. Inagaki Y. Masaki T. Kimura S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 314: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). For the competitive binding experiments, the CHO cells transiently expressing each receptor in 24-well plates were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in buffer B (minimum essential medium α containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) containing 100 pm125I-ET-1 with various concentrations of unlabeled ET-1 or ET-3. The cells were then transferred in 0.4 m NaOH to a gamma counter. The density of the receptors was determined by saturation isotherms of 125I-ET-1 binding to the intact cells as described above, except a condition of incubation at 4 °C for 7 h. In membrane binding experiments, to separate bound from free ligands, membrane pellets were washed and centrifuged at 21,800 × g for 5 min three times. Nonspecific binding was defined as the binding in the presence of 100 nmunlabeled ET-1. The cells were incubated in the loading buffer (20 mmHepes-Hanks (pH 7.4) containing 11 mm glucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) with 4 μm Fura-2/AM for 60 min at 20 °C. Intracellular Ca2+ transients evoked by ET-1 and ET-3 were monitored by a CAF-110 fluorescence spectrophotometer (JASCO Co., Tokyo, Japan) with dual excitation at 340 nm/380 nm and emission at 500 nm. The cells at 80% confluency were incubated in 300 μl of buffer B containing 1 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine at 37 °C for 20 min. Agonists and 1 μm forskolin were added, and the cAMP accumulation was allowed to continue for 10 min at 37 °C. The cAMP contents were measured using a Yamasa radioimmunoassay kit. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Trizol. The total RNAs (20 μg) were electrophoresed on a 1% denaturing agarose gel (containing 18% formaldehyde) and blotted to a nylon membrane. The blots were probed with a 536-bp (EcoRV-EcoRI restriction) nick-translated hETB receptor cDNA fragment and subjected to autoradiography at −80 °C for 34 h. The intensities of specific mRNAs were quantified using a BAS 2000 Fuji Bio-Image analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co., Kawasaki, Japan). A peptide (CLKFKANDHGYDNFRSSNKYSSS) corresponding to the carboxyl terminus (420–442) of the hETB receptor was coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antiserum was raised in Japanese White rabbits (2.5 kg). The peptide keyhole limpet hemocyanin was emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant and injected subcutaneously at multiple sites on the back five times biweekly. The serum was affinity purified with Sulfolink Coupling Gel (Pierce) coupled with the peptide. The antibody recognized only the ETB receptor and not the ETA receptor. The details will be published elsewhere. 2M. Takimoto and S. Hori, manuscript in preparation. The cells were fixed for 1 h in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde and then immersed in 50% ethanol in PBS for 10 min. After blocking for 1 h with 10% goat serum in PBS, the cells were incubated with 4 μg/ml anti-hETBreceptor antibody for 12 h at 4 °C. After washing, the cells were incubated in PBS containing 1% goat serum and the fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2fragments for 3 h at room temperature. Fluorescence images were taken in a confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) using a × 63 objective lens. The membrane samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked with 4% skim milk for 12 h. After washing, the membrane was incubated with 4 μg/ml anti-hETB receptor antibody for 4 h at room temperature and followed by incubation with 0.3 μg/ml peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h. The bands were visualized by the Western blot chemiluminescence reagent and quantified using the NIH Image program. The low temperature SDS-PAGE was performed as described (31Takasuka T. Akiyama N. Horii I. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, the membrane protein samples (20 μg) were incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in buffer B containing 100 pm125I-ET-1 with or without 100 nmunlabeled ET-1. After washing, the samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE at 4 °C and to autoradiography for 35 h. We analyzed alterations ofEDNRB in 31 patients with HSCR (TableI); the ratio of males is 74% (23:31), and those of short type and familial HSCR are 71% (15:21, length undetermined in 10 cases) and 6% (2:31), respectively. In SSCP analyses of the seven exons containing the entire coding region ofEDNRB, we identified three mobility shifts, two in exon 1, and one in exon 6 (Fig. 2 A). The allelic status of patients 19, 20, and 16 were heterozygous with normal and aberrant bands, homozygous consisting of aberrant bands and heterozygous with normal and aberrant bands, respectively. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed two transversions, A to T at nucleotide 311 and C to A at nucleotide 1170, and a transition, T to C at nucleotide 325 (Fig. 2 B). All mutations were missense; the first transversion resulted in the substitution of isoleucine for asparagine at position 104 (N104I), the second, arginine for serine at position 390 (S390R), and the transition, arginine for cysteine at position 109 (C109R). N104I and C109R mutations are located within the transmembrane domain (TM) 1, and S390R is located in the carboxyl-terminal region and adjacent to TM 7.Table ICharacteristics of 31 HSCR patients utilized for mutation screeningPatient (sex)Family typeSegment length1-aThe classification is based on the length of aganglionosis (45).CommentsMutation 1 (M)Single caseShort 2 (F)Single case 3 (M)Single case 4 (M)Single caseShort 5 (M)Single caseLong 6 (M)Single caseShort 7 (M)Single caseShortDown's syndrome 8 (M)Single caseLong 9 (F)Single caseLong10 (F)Single case11 (M)Single caseShort12 (M)Single case13 (M)Single caseShort14 (M)Single caseShort15 (M)Single caseShort16 (M)1-bMutations were found.

Open table in a new tab To clarify whether these mutations were related with HSCR predisposition, we examined binding affinities for ET-1 and ET-3 by the competitive binding experiments using intact CHO cells transiently expressing the mutant hETB receptors. The IC50 values of the wild-type, N104I, and S390R receptors were as follows: 147 ± 39, 240 ± 81, and 159 ± 22 pm for ET-1; 492 ± 120, 339 ± 143, and 328 ± 135 pm for ET-3, respectively (TableII). Similar IC50 values were obtained in the stably expressing cells (data not shown). These results indicated that N104I and S390R receptors have the ligand affinities closely similar to those of the wild type. In contrast, CHO or Ltk− cells transfected with C109R receptors showed almost no specific 125I-ET-1 binding at 100 pm.Table IILigand binding and functional properties of the wild-type or the mutant hET B receptors expressed in CHO cellsLigand binding[Ca2+] i response to ET-1Adenylyl cyclaseB maxIC50(pm)2-aValues are the means ± S.E. of three experiments each done in triplicate, using transiently expressing cells.

Open table in a new tab To analyze functional properties of the mutant receptors, we used CHO clonal cell lines stably expressing the wild-type (CHOW), N104I (CHON104I), and S390R (CHOS390R) receptors whose densities were 8.6, 3.8, and 33.3 fmol/105 cells, respectively (Table II). In CHOW and CHON104I, ET-1 elicited similar concentration-dependent increases in [Ca2+] i transients (Fig. 3 A, Table II). In contrast, the [Ca2+] i responses in CHOS390Rwere markedly decreased, despite the fact that the receptor density was higher than that of CHOW. The EC50 values of CHOW and CHOS390R were 146 ± 74 and 4,639 ± 1,468 pm, and their maximal responses (E max) were 157.6 ± 4.5 and 15.8 ± 2.3%, respectively. In CHOW, ET-1 or ET-3 inhibited forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3 B, Table II). The EC50value for the inhibitory effect of ET-1 was 10 pm, and theE max values for ET-1 and ET-3 were 42.6 and 53.5% inhibition, respectively. In CHON104I, the EC50 and the E max values for ET-1 and ET-3 were similar to those in CHOW. On the other hand, in CHOS390R, the inhibitory effects of both ET-1 and ET-3 were markedly reduced. Namely the EC50 for ET-1 was 65 pm, and the E max values for ET-1 and ET-3 were 9.6 and 0%, respectively. During the course of screening for colonies stably expressing C109R receptors, none of the colonies showed specific 125I-ET-1 binding at 100 pm, as observed in the cells transiently expressing C109R receptors. To test a possibility that this phenomenon was due to the low levels of the mRNA, a CHO cell line stably expressing C109R receptors (CHOC109R) was selected, and the amounts of the mRNA and the receptor proteins in the plasma membrane in CHOC109R were examined by Northern blotting and binding analyses. The mRNA level in CHOC109R was proven to be about seven times higher than that in CHOW. In the intact CHOW and CHOC109R cells, theB max values were 3.48 and 0.15 fmol/105 cells, and the K d values were 0.17 and 0.96 nm, respectively (Fig. 4). On the other hand, in CHOC109R membrane preparations, the displacement analysis of 125I-ET-1 bindings at 1 nm by unlabeled ET-1 revealed the surprisingly low affinity (the IC50 value was 39.5 ± 19.8 nm), in no agreement with the case of the intact cells. To obtain further evidence that the mRNAs were actually translated, the CHO cells were subjected to immunostaining with the anti-hETB receptor antibody. In CHOW, the translated hETB receptors existed diffusely in the entire cells, especially densely in cell processes (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, in CHOC109R, only the regions near the nuclei were stained (Fig. 5 B). These stainings were not observed in mock-transfected CHO cells (Fig. 5 C). Western blot analysis showed two major bands of 50 and 33 kDa, and a minor band of 44 kDa in CHOW. In contrast, in CHOC109R, one major band of 44 kDa and a faint band of 50 kDa were detected (Fig. 5 D). The relative amounts of the 44-kDa protein were 15.3% in CHOW and 80.1% in CHOC109R. Therefore, the 44-kDa protein might account for the staining nearby the nuclei in CHOC109R. These bands were all absent in mock-transfected cells. Since the ligand-ETB receptor complex is known to be SDS-resistant and stable at a reduced temperature, the low temperature SDS-PAGE is a useful method for detection of the active ETBreceptor species (31Takasuka T. Akiyama N. Horii I. Furuichi Y. Watanabe T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1992; 111: 748-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the low temperature SDS-PAGE of CHOW membranes, only two bands of 50 and 33 kDa, but not 44 kDa, were detected with 125I-ET-1 (Fig. 5 E), suggesting that the 44-kDa protein was unable to bind to125I-ET-1 at 100 pm. In this study, we analyzed alterations of EDNRB in 31 patients with HSCR and detected three novel mutations: two transversions, A to T and C to A, at nucleotide 311 (N104I) and 1170 (S390R), respectively, and a transition, T to C, at nucleotide 325 (C109R). ETB is a heptahelical receptor that equally binds all three endothelin isopeptides and is involved in the intracellular signaling pathway via heterotrimeric G proteins (17Ceccherini I. Zhang A.L. Matera I. Yang G. Devoto M. Romeo G. Cass D.T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 18Gariepy C.E. Cass D.T. Yanagisawa M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 867-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The analyses of both intracellular Ca2+ transients and adenylyl cyclase activities of these mutants revealed that S390R mutation significantly decreased the responses to ET-1, although the binding affinities to the ligands were as high as the wild type. C109R receptors exhibited almost no binding to ET-1 and no functional activities due to the lack of the functionally active receptors in the plasma membrane, because the mutant receptors localized mainly around the nuclei. On the other hands, N104I receptors showed almost the same characteristics as those of the wild type. Taken together, it is concluded that S390R mutation causes a disorder of the intracellular signaling after the binding with agonists, that C109R mutation impairs the translocation of the receptor proteins to the plasma membrane, and that N104I mutation seems polymorphous. The newly found mutations of EDNRB in this report account for about 6% (2:31) of HSCR, consistent with the previous report (11Yanagisawa M. Circulation. 1994; 89: 1320-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Their inheritance states and phenotypes were as follows: one was heterozygous and long segment HSCR, and the other was homozygous and short segment HSCR. Both patients had no associated disease. As described in previous reports (19Attié T. Till M. Pelet A. Amiel J. Edery P. Boutrand L. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 2407-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 25Arai H. Nakao K. Takaya K. Hosoda K. Ogawa Y. Nakanishi S. Imura H. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst .). 1985; 34: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), these situations are in agreement with a hypothesis that HSCR would be a multigenic disorder. Namely an EDNRB mutation is neither necessary nor sufficient for explaining all clinical HSCR cases but, at least, it possibly accounts for some of them. It is well established that the disruption of the genes encoding the Ret or ETB receptor causes HSCR. Consequently, it is reasonable to expect that mutations of the genes of molecules essential for the signaling pathways via these receptors, such as GDNF, GDNF receptor-α (32Jing S. Wen D. Yu Y. Holst P.L. Luo Y. Fang M. Tamir R. Antonio L. Hu Z. Cupples R. Louis J.C. Hu S. Altrock B.W. Fox G.M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2098) Google Scholar). However, a mutation inGDNF itself was neither necessary nor sufficient to cause HSCR (35Angrist M. Bolk S. Halushka M. Lapchak P.A. Chakravarti A. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 341-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 36Salomon R. Attié T. Pelet A. Bidaud C. Eng C. Amiel J. Sarnacki S. Goulet O.

Genet. 1996; 14: 345-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), because major defects in the Ret pathway would be embryonic lethal or roles of GDNF in enteric neurogenesis could be compensated for by other neurotrophic factors, for example, neurturin. The analysis of another HSCR model mouse, the Dominant megacolon (Dom), might introduce a novel susceptibility gene that lies in human chromosome 22q12-q13 (37Pingault V. Puliti A. Préhu M.O. Samadi A. Bondurand N. Goossens M. Genomics. 1997; 39: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In this report, we performed functional analyses of the mutant hETB receptors. S390R mutation prevented the mutant receptors from coupling with heterotrimeric G proteins, resulting in decreases in the functions. The amino-terminal segment of the cytoplasmic domain from amino acid residues 390–402 contains the putative palmitoylation site and forms a fourth cytoplasmic loop, as found in other G protein-coupled receptors including the ETA receptor (38Horstmeyer A. Cramer H. Sauer T. Müller-Esterl W. Schroeder C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20811-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This loop in the ETAreceptor is required to couple with Gq but not Gs. In coupling of the ETA receptor with Gq, this requirement is also revealed (39Koshimizu T. Tsujimoto G. Ono K. Masaki T. Sakamoto A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 354-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The S390R mutation found in the present study, the replacement of serine 390 with arginine, a positively charged amino acid residue, might cause conformational change of this fourth cytoplasmic loop and might decrease in coupling with G proteins. C109R mutation that occurred in the amino-terminal region of TM 1 impaired the translocation of the mutant hETB receptor into the plasma membrane. Why C109R receptors are not transported into the plasma membrane with their proper orientation? It is generally accepted that when integral membrane proteins are inserted into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, about 20 amino acids of the amino-terminal region would play a role as a signal sequence and lead the translated polypeptide into the luminal space of the endoplasmic reticulum. It is also known that TM 1 would play a topogenic role as a stop transfer sequence (40Rothman R.E. Andrews D.W. Calayag M.C. Lingappa V.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10470-10480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Kuroiwa T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9251-9255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that these segments would require sufficient hydrophobicity to act efficiently. For example, when the non-polar amino acid residue in the type 1 signal anchor sequence of cytochrome P450 was replaced with the basic amino acid residue, the signal anchor sequence was converted to the secretory signal sequence (42Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In the case of C109R mutation in this study, the replacement of cysteine with arginine in TM 1 might change the targeting function of TM 1 both by the positively charged group and by the shortened length of the hydrophobic stretch of TM 1. Thus it seems possible that this mutant receptor might deviate from the normal transport pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane because of the improper folding and/or membrane topology, resulting in the accumulation near the nuclei (Fig. 5 B). A similar example of the hamster β-adrenergic receptor was reported previously (43Dixon R.A.F. Sigal I.S. Candelore M.R. Register R.B. Scattergood W. Rands E. Strader C.D. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3269-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). It is well known that the normal processing of the wild-type receptors generates a 50-kDa protein and its further degraded form, a 33-kDa protein, by metal proteinases (44Kozuka M. Ito T. Hirose S. Lodhi K.M. Hagiwara H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16892-16896Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the wrong translocation as described above, Western blot analysis showed that C109R receptor was processed to an unusual 44-kDa protein and a 50-kDa protein, as a major and a minor products, respectively. In the present study, this 44-kDa protein was also observed in the wild type, although it was a minor component. The binding studies revealed C109R receptors to have the very low B max and the fairly high affinity in the surface of intact cells but the surprisingly low affinity in the total membrane preparations, which include plasma membranes and subcellular organellar membranes (Fig. 4 C). Together with the relative ratios of the 44- and 50-kDa proteins in CHOW and CHOC109R cells, these results strongly indicate that the 50-kDa protein, which is located in the plasma membrane as a major form in CHOW and as a minor component in CHOC109R, has the high affinity and that the 44-kDa protein, which is located near the nuclei as a major component in CHOC109R and as a minor component in CHOW, has the very low affinity. In this study, we identified two mutations in EDNRBsusceptible to HSCR and demonstrated that the functional defects of the mutant receptors could be due to not only the impairment of signaling pathways but also the unusual processing pathway and the wrong translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1990373478,"The amyloid precursor superfamily is composed of three highly conserved transmembrane glycoproteins, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid precursor-like proteins 1 and 2 (APLP1, APLP2), whose functions are unknown. Proteolytic cleavage of APP yields the βA4 peptide, the major component of cerebral amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that five post-translationally modified, full-length species of APP and APLP2 (but not APLP1) arrive at the mature presynaptic terminal in the fastest wave of axonal transport and are subsequently rapidly cleared (mean half-life of 3.5 h). Rapid turnover of presynaptic APP and APLP2 occurs independently of visual activity. Turnover of the most rapidly arriving APP species was accompanied by a delayed accumulation of a 120-kDa, APP fragment lacking the C terminus, consistent with presynaptic APP turnover via constitutive proteolysis. Turnover of APLP2 was not accompanied by detectable APLP2 fragment peptides, suggesting either that APLP2 either is more rapidly degraded than is APP or is retrogradely transported shortly after reaching the terminus. A single 150-kDa APLP2 species containing the Kunitz protease inhibitor domain is the major amyloid precursor superfamily protein transported to the presynapse. Presynaptic APP and APLP2 are sialylated andN- and O-glycosylated, and some also carry chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan and/or dermatan sulfate glycosaminoglycan. The rapid kinetics for turnover of APP and APLP2 predict a sensitive balance of synthesis, transport, and elimination rates that may be critical to normal neuronal functions and metabolic fates of these proteins.

Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 489-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). APP is one of the three proteins encoded by genes in the mammalian amyloid precursor superfamily (APSF; see Fig. 1 A), which also has two genes encoding APLP1 and APLP2 (3Bush A.I.

Although the APP gene is the only APSF gene that encodes βA4, the conservation of gene structure (4Wasco W. Gurubhagavatula S. Paradis M.D. Romano D.M. Sisodia S.S. Hyman B.T. Neve R.L. Tanzi R.E.

For instance, APSF proteins from various phyla share highly conserved extracellular zinc and heparin binding domains (3Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. de Paradis M. Tanzi R.E. Wasco W. J. Biol.

Various combinations of these modifications yield several isoforms for APSF proteins that could differ significantly in terms of metabolism, transport and protein function. To better understand the regulation of neuronally expressed APSF proteins in vivo, we quantitatively and biochemically examined APSF protein expression and turnover in a major pathway of the central nervous system, the primary visual projection (Fig. 1 B). Previous studies have indicated that APP is synthesized by neuronal populations and that it undergoes fast anterograde transport (13Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Koo E.H. Sisodia S.S. Archer D.R. Martin L.J. Weidemann A. Beyreuther K. Fischer P. Masters C.L. Price D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 161: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), although the fate of axonally transported APP is relatively understudied, and no studies have examined APLP1 or APLP2 for axonal transport. Inspection of translated sequences reveals that all three APSF proteins carry a consensus clathrin binding region in the cytoplasmic tail. Various published data allude to a relationship between APP metabolism and endocytotic/endosomal membrane recycling (17Marquez-Sterling N.R. Lo A.C.Y. Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 140-151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Nitsch R.M. Farber S.A. Growdon J.H. Wurtman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5191-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Considering the tight regulation of the exocytotic-endocytotic cycle during excitation-release coupling in the presynaptic terminal (19Cremona O. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), it was hypothesized that metabolism of APP (and possibly of APLP1 and/or APLP2) would be coupled to clathrin-mediated endocytosis driven by activity-dependent presynaptic release of neurotransmitter. As presynaptic turnover would be suggestive of proteolysis, we also examined presynaptically targeted APSF proteins for evidence of proteolytic processing. Finally, the extracellular domains of APP and APLP2 may carry glycosylations (8Dyrks T. Weidemann A. Multhaup G. Salbaum J.M. Lemaire H.G. Kang J. Muller-Hill B. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) that could potentially interact with extracellular materials (20Small D.H. Nurcombe V. Moir R. Michaelson S. Monard D. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4143-4150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Caceres J. Brandan E. J.

Res. 1996; 45: 143-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) at the synapse. Thus, we examined neuronally expressed, presynaptically targeted APSF proteins for various types of glycosylation. In summary, we used a model neuron of the central nervous system to document the neosynthesis, multiple glycosylation, and rapid axonal transport of five distinct APP and APLP2 species to presynaptic terminals in vivo. We show, moreover, that these APP and APLP2 variants undergo rapid turnover in the presynaptic terminus independent of presynaptic neuronal activity. Adult Syrian hamsters (∼150 g) were anesthetized with a xylazine/Ketalar mixture (ratio 1:9; 0.3 μl/g of body weight). One eye per hamster was intraocularly injected with 100 μCi of [35S]Met (∼1100 Ci/mmol, Expre35S35S, NEN Life Science Products) in 2 μl of normal saline. This technique allows radiolabeling of nascent protein in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) whose axons innervate distinct target regions in the central nervous system (Fig. 1 B). Animals were sacrificed at various intervals after radiolabeling by pentobarbital overdose, after which the superior colliculus (SuC) and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) contralateral to the injected eyes were rapidly dissected and frozen at −70 °C. Each dissected SuC was individually homogenized in a glass-glass tissue homogenizer in 550 μl of lysis buffer containing 9.5 m urea, 2% w/v Nonidet P-40, 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol, and 6% v/v ampholines (pH 3.5–5.0, 5.0–8.0, 3.5–10.0) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the ratio 5:7:3. 500 μl of the homogenate was submitted to isoelectric focusing. Proteins were separated in the molecular weight dimension by polyacrylamide gel (5–15% linear gradient) electrophoresis in the presence of SDS in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were then transferred to PVDF membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore) in SDS-free transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine). After PVDF transfers had been used to generate storage phosphor images (see below), the same transfers were placed against autoradiographic film (Biomax, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 5–7 wk, after which the same PVDF transfers were processed for immunoblotting using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). In some cases, the blots were stripped (1 h, 50 °C in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% w/v SDS, 62.5 mmTris), rinsed, and reprobed with a different antibody. Thus, each PVDF transfer generated up to three types of images, a storage phosphor digital image, an autoradiographic film, and one to three ECL films. Because the storage phosphor images were not perfectly congruent with their autoradiograms, regions of interest (ROIs) on the storage phosphor images were identified by overlaying the autoradiogram and the ECL film(s) and then comparing the autoradiogram with the storage phosphor image. The antibodies used to identify APP, APLP1, and APLP2 proteins are detailed in Table I. Spots on the immunoblots that did not overlap with spots on autoradiograms were not considered relevant to our study of transported protein. Such spots may result from local expression of APSF proteins in retinal target tissues.Table ISummary of immunoreactivity of APSF proteins fast-transported to RGC terminalsROI1-bSee Fig. 2.Protein1-cBased on immunoblotting.Molecular Mass (kDa)pIProtein specificity, epitope specificity, antibody, and Ref. numberAPP, C terminus, CT15 (13Sisodia S.S.

After homogenization, Triton X-100 (12.5 mm) and Nonidet P-40 (0.2%) was added to the homogenate mixture. The mixture was precleared with hydrated protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were removed by centrifugation, and aliquots of the supernatant were incubated with either D2-II, CT12, or CT15 polyclonal antisera (see Table I) and mixed overnight at 4 °C. Fresh protein A-Sepharose beads were mixed with the samples for 1 h at room temperature. Beads were recovered by centrifugation, washed in immunoprecipitation buffer (homogenization buffer, Triton X-100, and Nonidet P-40), and divided into aliquots for enzymatic digestion.N-Glycosylated residues were digested by adding 2 units ofN-glycanase (Genzyme) to 300-μl aliquots of immunoprecipitated protein in 15 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with protease inhibitors (see above) and incubating overnight. Sialic acid and O-glycosylated residues were digested sequentially. Neuraminidase (0.3 units; Genzyme) was added to 600-μl aliquots, and samples were incubated for 4 h. 300 μl was removed, O-glycanase (40 milliunits; Genzyme) was added to the remaining 300 μl, and samples were incubated overnight. Chondroitin sulfate residues were digested by the addition of chondroitinase AC (0.5 units; Sigma) to 300-μl aliquots in 100 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 7.0) with protease inhibitors and incubation for 2 h. Chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate residues were digested by the addition of chondroitinase ABC (0.5 units; Sigma) to 300-μl aliquots in 100 mm Tris acetate buffer (pH 8.0) and incubation for 2 h. All digestion was carried out at 37 °C. Digested samples were frozen on dry ice and lyophilized. Lyophilized proteins were solubilized in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to PVDF membranes that were used to expose storage phosphor screens and Biomax film. Control digestion (no enzyme added) demonstrated that samples did not undergo spontaneous degradation during incubations. The central nervous system projection neuron of the retina, the RGC, sends an axon from the retina to synaptic target fields in the SuC and LGN (Fig. 1 B) (24Robertson R.T. Ambe R.K. Yu J. Dev. Brain Res. 1989; 46: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Since about 95% of RGC axons decussate in the adult Syrian hamster (25Bhide P.G. Frost D.O. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 485-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our studies here focus only on proteins sent to target areas contralateral to the injected eye. Neosynthesis of protein in the eye and its subsequent axonal transport is the only significant source of radiolabeled protein in the target areas relevant to this study (Ref.26Moya K.L. Benowitz L.I. Jhaveri S. Schneider G.E. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 4445-4454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see footnote 2). To differentiate highly homologous members of the APSF (Fig. 1 A), a battery of antisera with well documented specificities (see “Experimental Procedures” and TableI) was used to probe the two-dimensional PVDF transfers. The positions and shapes of ROIs on autoradiograms matched corresponding spots on immublots with high precision. Six ROIs (Fig. 2 A) were identified as immunopositive for one or more of these APSF-specific antisera. Fig. 2summarizes multiple immunoblots. Antisera specific for APP and APLP2 immuoprecipitate radiolabeled proteins of appropriate molecular weight (see Fig. 4) and isoelectric point (not shown). This provides further evidence that overlap of spots on the immunoblots with matching ROIs on autoradiograms does indeed identify those ROIs as transported proteins.Figure 4Enzymatic digestion of carbohydrate moieties on immunoprecipitated APP (A and B) and APLP2 (C–F) from presynaptic terminals.

These ROIs on 4-h storage phosphor images matched congruent (but less intense) ROIs on 8 and 12 h storage phosphor images when viewed with contrast enhancement in pseudocolor mode (see Fig. 3). The three CT15-positive ROIs (b–d) were also detected by pAb GID (APP N terminus; Fig. 2 C) but were not detected by other antisera specific for the other members of the APSF, including CT12 (APLP2 C terminus, Fig. 2 D), CT11 (APLP1 C terminus, Fig. 2 E), or D2-II (APLP2 N terminus, not shown). These three ROIs were also immunonegative for pAb R7 (KPI-APP, not shown). These new data, when taken together with other previously published findings (see “Discussion”), lead to the conclusion that ROIs c–erepresent full-length variants of APP that are fast axonally transported to presynaptic terminals. ROI f (Fig. 2 A) was immunopositive for the APP N-terminal-specific antiserum, GID, which also recognized ROIs b–d (Fig. 2 C). However, ROI f was immunonegative for all APSF C-terminal antibodies (CT11, CT12, and CT15; Fig. 2,B–D) and for D2-II (not shown). The most parsimonious explanation for these new data and other previously published evidence (see “Discussion”) is that ROI f represents an APP variant lacking the C terminus. Immunoreactivity for pAb CT12 (APLP2 C terminus) precisely overlapped with ROIs a and e(Fig. 2 D). These two ROIs were also detected by pAb D2-II (not shown). ROIs a and e were not detected by any of the other antisera specific for the other members of the APSF, namely CT15 (Fig. 2 B), GID (Fig. 2 C), and CT11 (Fig. 2 E). However, ROIs a and ediffered in immunoreactivity in that ROI a was immunopositive for the KPI domain-specific antisera R7 (not shown), whereas ROI e was immunonegative. These data suggest that ROIs a and e represent full-length variants of APLP2, resulting from expression of two distinct APLP2 isoforms, one with the KPI-domain (a) and one without the KPI domain (e). pAb CT11 showed no reactivity in the adult tissues used in these studies for any radiolabeled ROIs, indicating that axonal transport of APLP1 to mature presynaptic termini is nonexistent or undetectable by our method (Fig. 2 E). A visual qualitative impression of the protein turnover is given in a series of storage phosphor images in Fig. 3 A. Levels of radiolabeled APP and APLP2 species transported to presynaptic termini of a single SuC, as represented by ROIs a–f, were quantified from storage phosphor images as the sum of pixel values in the individual ROIs. These sums from individual SuCs were grouped and averaged for post-injection time points. The averages were in turn scaled to maximum raw values for each ROI at each time point and graphed (Figs. 3,B and C). Three APP species (ROIs b-d; Fig. 3 B) and two APLP2 species (ROIs a ande; Fig. 3 C) are prominent among the newly synthesized proteins, arriving at the presynaptic terminus in the earliest wave of fast axonal transport. Visual examination of time course graphs shows that the levels for ROIs a–e peak at 4 h, after which time they decay with similar lifetimes. TableII documents that for the five fastest APSF ROIs, APP (ROIs b-d) and APLP2 (ROIs a ande) contribute equally to the total APSF protein species, which reach the presynaptic terminus by fast axonal transport. Of these five ROIs, a single APLP2 species (ROI a) contributes more than double any other species.Table IIAnalysis of transport and turnover of APP and APLP2 species in RGC presynaptic terminiProteinROIPeakExponential decay2-cExponential time constant of decay (63%) ± S.E.Linear decay2-eTime for time course curve to fall to 50% of peak value. 50% decayIntegration2-1006Clearance time for 50% of transported protein. 50% turnoverAmplitude2-aExpressed as the average of total pixel value.Time2-bPost-radiolabeling.τr22-1004Coefficient of correlation.×10 6 ± S.D.hhhhAPPb4.2 ± 0.949.6 ± 4.50.836.84.0c14 ± 1.644.9 ± 1.30.974.22.8d11 ± 1.145.4 ± 1.80.944.93.0f56 ± 2082.1 ± 0.20.996.44.9APLP2a25 ± 3.246.6 ± 2.60.916.43.5e7.5 ± 1.043.8 ± 0.10.993.12.62-a Expressed as the average of total pixel value.2-b Post-radiolabeling.2-c Exponential time constant of decay (63%) ± S.E.2-d Coefficient of correlation.2-e Time for time course curve to fall to 50% of peak value.2-f Clearance time for 50% of transported protein. Open table in a new tab To more precisely describe protein lifetime in the presynaptic terminus, we quantified turnover rate for each ROI using three mathematically independent methods. First, decay from the peak value was fit by a single exponential curve, giving time constants of decay (decay to 37% of peak) ranging from 2.1 to 9.6 h (Table II). Second, simple linear decay from peak value to 50% peak level was calculated. These 50% linear decays ranged from 3.1 to 6.8 h (Table II). Finally, the transport curves were integrated, and the time by which 50% of total transported material had accrued was calculated. Subtracting 3.5 h (to estimate protein arrival time) from this time gives the time taken for eliminating 50% of transported material (presynaptic half-life). These half-lives ranged from 2.6 to 4.0 h (Table II). All three parameters are consistent in their ranking of turnover stability for ROIs a–e despite differences in absolute values. Taken together, these three parameters of presynaptic protein lifetime indicate that in general, ROIs a–e are cleared from the presynaptic terminus in about the same amount of time as it takes for their synthesis and transport to the presynaptic terminal. This implies that these APSF proteins undergo continuous and rapid transport and clearance from the presynaptic terminal. ROI f, an APP-immunopositive ROI, was distinguished from ROIs a–e in that it peaked 4 h after all other ROIs (8 h, Fig. 3 B; Table II), although it too is rapidly cleared from RGC presynaptic termini (Fig. 3 B; Table II). It is also interesting that the peak of ROI f (Table II) is significantly larger than the peaks of the other APP-ROIs (b–d). In fact, the sum of the peaks of ROIsb–d (at 4 h, Table II) accounts for 47% of the peak of ROI f (at 8 h), whereas the sum of the integrated areas of time course curves (Fig. 3 B) for ROIsb–d (Fig. 3 B) accounts for 43% of the integrated area of ROI f. Thus, approximately one-half of ROI f may in fact be more slowly transported than ROIsb–d (see “Discussion”). On the other hand, the large standard error of the peak value of ROI f may, unfortunately, distort a closer quantitative match between ROIsb–d and ROI f. Nonetheless, these new data strongly suggest that a significant fraction ROI f could be due to presynaptic proteolytic processing of other APP species (ROIsb, c, and/or d). Finally, no putative cleavage fragments for APLP2 ROIs a or c were observed. This is noteworthy in that ROI a is highly abundant, and thus we would have expected to easily detect C-terminal fragments with pAb CT12 and N-terminal fragments with pAb D2-II. Whether turnover kinetics for synaptically targeted APP/APLP2 species were dependent on neurotransmitter release mechanisms was tested by blocking action potential generation in RGC axons and measuring ROIsa–f 8 h post-radiolabeling. Our reasoning was that were turnover of APP and APLP2 activity-dependent, then ROIs a–e would remain elevated at 8 h rather than falling from peak levels at 4 h. Furthermore, we reasoned that were any ROI f derived from activity-dependent turnover of APP, that the peak of ROI f at 8 h would be diminished by activity blockade. Quantitative analysis of these data showed, however, that relative to control injection, tetrodotoxin injection did not raise ROIs a–e nor lower ROI f8 h after radiolabeling (p value range 0.19–0.41, one-tailed t tests), i.e. all APP and APLP2 species appear to show the same transport"
https://openalex.org/W2154171823,"Human γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors were expressed in the baculovirus/Sf-9 insect cell expression system using recombinant cDNA of α1β2γ2s subunits. The effect of unsaturated fatty acids on GABAA receptor complexes was investigated electrophysiologically using conventional whole cell recording under voltage clamp. Three distinct effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on the GABA responses were observed. First, DHA, at a concentration of 10−7m or greater, accelerated the desensitization after the peak of the GABA-induced current. Second, DHA (10−6m) potentiated the peak amplitude of GABA response. This potentiation by DHA was inhibited in the presence of Zn2+ (10−5m); Cu2+ and Ni2+ mimicked the action of Zn2+. Zn2+ (10−5m) did not block the GABA response on α1β2γ2s receptor complexes. Third, DHA, at a concentration of 3 × 10−6m or higher, gradually suppressed the peak amplitude of GABA response. A protein kinase A inhibitor, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and a Ca2+ chelator did not modify the effects of DHA on GABA-induced chloride ion current. Six unsaturated fatty acids other than DHA were examined. Arachidonic acid mimicked the effect of DHA while e.g. oleic acid had no effect.The inhibition of the GABA response in the presence of DHA was also observed in cells expressing GABAA receptors of α1 and β2 subunit combinations. The data show that the γ subunit is essential for DHA and arachidonic acid to potentiate the GABA-induced Cl− channel activity and to affect the desensitization kinetics of the GABAAreceptor.

The data show that the γ subunit is essential for DHA and arachidonic acid to potentiate the GABA-induced Cl− channel activity and to affect the desensitization kinetics of the GABAAreceptor. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are essential fatty acids that are abundantly bound in the phospholipids of brain membranes. The fatty acids influence the membrane fluidity of the neuronal plasma membrane as well as the functional properties of integral membrane protein (1Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar). Arachidonic acid (AA) 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: AA, arachidonic acid; DHA, docosahexaenoic acid; GABAA, γ-aminobutyric acid type A; BAPTA, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid. and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are polyunsaturated fatty acids localized in the 2-position of membrane phospholipids and are liberated by various intracellular enzymes such as phospholipase A2 and diacylglycerol lipase (2Piomelli D. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Recently, various actions of these free fatty acids on the functional properties of neuronal plasma membrane neurotransmitter receptors have been reported, such as N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor (3Miller B. Sarantis M. Traynelis S.F. Attwell D. Nature. 1992; 355: 722-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 4Nishikawa M. Kimura S. Akaike N. J.

As for the effect of unsaturated fatty acids on γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, an electrophysiological study demonstrated that AA and DHA potently suppressed the GABAA receptor-mediated current response in the rat substantia nigra neurons (7Hamano H. Nabekura J. Ogawa T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Receptor binding studies have shown marked effects of unsaturated fatty acids on brain GABAA receptor complexes in vitro (8Nielsen M. Witt M.R. Thogersen H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1988; 146: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Ueno E. Kuriyama K. Neuropharmacology. 1981; 20: 1169-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Koenig J.A.

Hastrup S. Nielsen M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2141-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a variety of actions of fatty acids on the GABAA receptor-channel complex. The diversity of effects induced by free fatty acids might be due to ontogenetic, phylogenetic, and regional differences of the GABAA receptor subunit composition in the brain regions studied (13McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a recent study on recombinant human GABAA receptors (12Witt M.R. Westh-Hansen S.E. Rasmussen P.B. Hastrup S. Nielsen M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2141-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported that the effect of unsaturated fatty acids was dependent on the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor complexes. In addition, various combinations of GABAA receptor subunits might be expressed in the same neuron, complicating the interpretation of data on the effect of free fatty acids on the GABAA receptor complex obtained at the level of single cells, as, for example, by whole cell patch clamp techniques. The insect cell Sf-9/baculovirus expression system in combination with electrophysiological techniques provide the means for the investigation of functional difference between GABAA receptors consisting of various subunits. For this purpose, we employed recombinant human GABA receptor-channel complexes composed of α1β2γ2s subunits expressed in the Sf-9 insect cell system. GABAA receptor complexes composed of α1, β2, and γ2ssubunits have been suggested to be highly abundant in the vertebrate brain (13McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J.

In this study, the effects of DHA and other fatty acids on GABA-induced chloride currents were investigated in recombinant human GABAA receptor-channel complexes composed of α1β2γ2s subunits expressed in the Sf-9 insect cell system. The construction of expression vectors for the human GABAA receptors subunits α1, β2, and γ2s has been described previously (18Westh-Hansen S.E. Rasmussen P.B. Hastrup S. Nabekura J. Noguchi K.

Solid-phase DNA sequencing (Dynal®) combined with sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) of each insert DNA verified that the amino acid sequences of the α1 and β2 subunits were identical to those previously reported (19Schofield P.R. Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H.

Sf-9 insect cells were grown in spinner flask cultures at 27 °C in serum-free medium (Sf900-II-SFM, Life Technologies, Inc.). Insect cells at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells/35-mm Petri dish (Falcon) were infected with baculovirus containing human cDNA of α1, β2, and γ2ssubunits at a multiplicity of infection of 3:1:2 or α1and β2 subunits at a multiplicitity of infection of 3:1. The infected cells were incubated at 27 °C for 48 h. At approximately 48 h postinfection, Sf-9 cells were constantly perfused with extracellular solution at a flow rate of 3–4 ml/min. The composition of the standard external solution was (in mm): NaCl 150, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2, glucose 10, HEPES 10. The pH was adjusted to 7.4 by Tris base. Patch pipettes contained a solution of (in mm): Cs2SO4 50, CsCl 78, MgCl2 6, EGTA 5, ATP 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.2 by Tris base). Series resistances in whole cell voltage clamp experiments were calculated from the capacitative current peak in a 10 mV voltage step and were in range of 10–25 megohms. Electrical recordings were carried out using conventional whole cell patch recording. Patch pipettes were made of glass capillaries with an outer diameter of 1.5 mm using a vertical puller (Narishige, PB-7, Japan). The cells were voltage-clamped using a voltage-clamp amplifier (Nihon Koden, CEZ-2300, Japan). All signals were filtered with a low pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 1 KHz, monitored on a syncroscope (Iwatsu, MS-SlOOA, Japan) and a pen recorder (Sanei, Recti Horiz 8K, Japan), then digitized at a rate of 44 KHz (Sony, PCM 501 ESN, Japan). The data were stored on video tape (Mitsubishi, HV-F73, Japan). All experiments were carried out at room temperature (23–25 °C). Rapid application of drugs was achieved by the “Y tube” method as described previously (22Murase K. Randic M. Shirasaki T. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1990; 525: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In the present study, each drug was applied at an interval of more than 2 min unless otherwise stated. The drugs used for current recording were GABA, H-89, chelerythrine, and BAPTA (Sigma). DHA, AA, docosahexapentaenoic acid, docosatetraenoic acid, docosatrienoic acid, docosadienoic acid, and oleic acid were from Funakoshi, Tokyo, Japan. Free fatty acids were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and diluted into the extracellular solution just before use. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide was less than 0.1% (v/v). The experimental values are presented as mean ± S.D. Student's t test was used when two groups were compared. When relationships between the peak current amplitude and the GABA concentration were examined, continuous lines were fitted according to the following equation I=Imax·Cn/(EC50n+Cn)Equation 1 where I is the normalized value of the current,I max the maximal response, C the GABA concentration, EC50 the concentration corresponding to the half-maximal response, and n the apparent Hill coefficient. The concentration-inhibition curves were drawn using a mirror image of the modified Michael-Menten equation in combination with a least-square fitting routine after normalizing the amplitudes of the responses unless otherwise stated. I/Icontrol≃1−Cn/(EC50n+Cn)Equation 2 I indicates the normalized value of the current obtained with the concentration (C) of the drug, where the control response is defined as 1. Then, I=1−Cn/(IC50n+Cn)Equation 3 IC50 and n denote the concentration giving half-maximal response and the Hill coefficient, respectively. In Sf-9 cells transfected with homomeric α1, β2, or γ2s or dimeric α1γ2s or β2γ2sreceptor subunit combinations, GABA (up to 10−3m) did not induce any detectable current (less than 5 pA,n = 10–12 in each group) at a holding potential (V H ) of −40 mV (data not shown). On the other hand, in cells transfected either with dimeric α1 and β2, or with trimeric α1, β2, and γ2s receptor subunit combinations, 3 × 10−5m GABA produced an initial peak inward current followed by a gradual desensitization at aV H of −40 mV (Figs. 1and 6). Immediately after the removal of GABA from the perfusate, the inward current returned to the current level prior to the application of GABA. The respective concentrations of GABA for threshold and EC50 were 10−6m and 3.1 × 10−5m in α1β2, and 10−6m and 4.7 × 10−5m in α1β2γ2sreceptor subunit combinations.Figure 6Effect of DHA on the GABA response in α1β2 GABAA receptor subunit combinations.

In α1β2γ2sreceptor subunit combinations, three distinct time and concentration-dependent effects of DHA were observed. First, DHA (10−6m) gradually accelerated the decay of I GABA following the peak amplitude as shown in the Fig. 1 A, a. In the absence of DHA, the decay time to 80% of the initial peak amplitude (T 0.8) was 2.17 ± 0.09 s (mean ± S.D., n = 7). After continuous application of DHA (10−6m) for 3 and 10 min, the T0.8 values were reduced to 1.26 ± 0.08 s (n = 7) and 0.34 ± 0.06 s (n= 6), respectively. Both T 0.8 values obtained with DHA are significantly different from the controlT 0.8 value (p < 0.05,t test). After the removal of DHA from the perfusate, theT 0.8 values returned gradually to the control value. This process usually required more than 20 min. The effect of DHA on the peak amplitude induced by GABA in α1β2γ2s receptor subunit combinations was concentration dependent. The peakI GABA was potentiated by 10−6m DHA (n = 8) (Fig. 1 A,a). This potentiation was apparent even if 10−6m DHA was applied simultaneously with GABA and faded rapidly upon removal of DHA from the perfusate. The effect of 10−6m DHA on the GABA response was also dependent on the concentration of GABA used, since 10−6m DHA significantly potentiated the current responses to 3 × 10−5m GABA or lower. However, at concentrations of 10−4m or higher, the potentiation was not evident (Fig. 2 B, bar graph inset). DHA, at concentrations higher than 3 × 10−6m, invariably suppressed the peakI GABA in a concentration and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1 A, b, and B). The time interval to the maximal suppression ofI GABA was dependent on the DHA concentration applied (Fig. 1 B). The peak I GABAsuppressed by DHA gradually returned to the original value after the washing out of DHA (Fig. 1 A, b, andB). The concentration-response relationships for GABA in the absence or presence of DHA demonstrate that DHA affects the peakI GABA without affecting the threshold concentration and EC50 value; respective values were 10−6m and 5.3 × 10−5m in the absence of DHA, 10−6mand 4.1 × 10−5m in the presence of 10−6m DHA, and 10−6m and 4.8 × 10−5m in the presence of 3 × 10−6m DHA (Fig. 2). These results indicate that DHA at a concentration higher than 10−6m inhibits the GABA response in α1β2γ2s receptor subunit combinations in a noncompetitive manner. DHA and other fatty acids affect the mobilization of intracellular effector molecules such as protein kinase C (23McPhail L.C. Clayton C.C. Snyderman R. Science. 1984; 224: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and intracellular Ca2+ (24Calderaro V. Parrillo C. Balestrieri M.L. Giovane A. Filippelli A. Rossi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 737-746PubMed Google Scholar, 25Packham D.E. Jiang L. Conigrave A.D. Cell Calcium. 1995; 17: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Since several different putative phosphorylation sites have been suggested in GABAA receptor complexes consisting of α1β2γ2s subunit combinations (26Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the possible involvement of several intracellular modulators in the effects of DHA on the GABA response of α1β2γ2s receptor subunit combinations. Addition of H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor and intracellular application of BAPTA, a Ca2+ chelator, did neither affect the potentiation of the 3 × 10−5m GABA response by 10−6m DHA nor the inhibition of the GABA responses induced by 3 × 10−6mDHA (Fig. 3). Furthermore, the effects of DHA on the desensitization of I GABA persisted in the presence of these inhibitors. The T 0.8values for the experiments with the inhibitors in the presence of 3 × 10−6m DHA in all experiments were control (DHA only); 0.35 ± 0.08 s (n = 6) H-89 (10−6m); 0.32 ± 0.05 s (n = 4), chelerythrine (3 × 10−6m); 0.38 ± 0.06 s (n = 4), BAPTA (10−3m); 0.41 ± 0.09 s (n = 4). These results suggest that neither protein kinase A or C or intracellular Ca2+ are involved in the modulatory actions of DHA on the GABA response of α1β2γ2 s receptor subunit combinations. Surprisingly, the facilitatory effect of DHA (10−6m) on the peak I GABA was blocked by adding Zn2+ (10−5m) (Fig. 4 A), a concentration at which Zn2+ only minimally suppressed the peak of GABA response in the α1β2γ2s GABAAreceptor subunit combinations (Fig. 4 A). The DHA concentrations for threshold and IC50 values for the response induced by GABA (3 × 10−5m) were 3 × 10−7m and 3 × 10−6m with 10−5mZn2+, respectively. Other divalent cations such as Ni2+ (Fig. 4 C, n = 4) and Cu2+ (n = 4, data not shown) mimicked the antagonistic effect of Zn2+ on the potentiation of the GABA response by DHA. Removal of both Ca2+ and Mg2+from the perfusate did not affect the potentiating ratio of the response induced by 10−6m DHA (19.2 ± 4.8%, n = 4). However, the changes in the desensitization kinetics of I GABA induced by DHA were unaffected by these divalent cations (Fig. 4, A andC). Unsaturated fatty acids other than DHA, e.g. AA have been reported to inhibit the GABAA response in rat substantia nigra neurons (7Hamano H. Nabekura J. Ogawa T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the effects of various unsaturated fatty acids on GABAAα1β2γ2s receptor subunit combinations with the surprising result that only AA was able to mimic the effects of DHA while compounds structurally closely related to DHA,e.g. docosapentaenoic acid or an endogenous, relatively common unsaturated fatty acid, oleic acid, were inactive (Fig. 5). In Sf-9 cells expressing GABAA receptors composed of α1β2 subunit combinations, DHA, in a concentration-dependent manner, suppressed the response to GABA (3 × 10−5m) (Fig. 6 A). The effect of DHA was restricted to the inhibitory effect, since neither a potentiation of the GABA response (Fig. 6 A) or an alteration of the desensitization of I GABA (Fig. 6 C) as in the case of α1β2γ2sreceptor subunit combinations could be observed in α1β2 subunit combinations. The concentration-response relationship for GABA indicates that GABA concentrations for threshold and EC50 values were 3 × 10−6m and 4.35 × 10−5m in the absence, and 3 × 10−6m and 1.15 × 10−5m in the presence of DHA (10−6m) (Fig. 6 B). These data suggest that DHA is a noncompetitive inhibitor of GABA in α1β2 subunit combinations. In the present study it was shown that 1) in GABAAreceptor complexes consisting of α1β2γ2s and α1β2 receptor subunit combinations, Zn2+ blocks the GABA-induced Cl− channel activity. The presence of a γ2s subunit in the GABAA receptor complexes markedly diminished the inhibitory effect of Zn2+. 2) The presence of the γ2ssubunit in the receptor complex is essential for DHA to potentiate the GABA response of α1β2γ2sreceptor subunit combinations, this response is blocked by Zn2+, Cu2+ and Ni2+. Furthermore, DHA accelerates the desensitization of I GABA in α1β2γ2s combinations, this effect was not blocked by the divalent cations. 3) DHA and AA, at concentrations higher than 10−6m, block the GABA-induced Cl− channel activity in α1β2γ2s and α1β2 receptor subunit combinations, while other unsaturated fatty acids, e.g. oleic acid, had no effect. These result suggest that DHA has a number of molecular target sites within the GABAA receptor channel complex. One site might be related to the Cl− channel domain. Two additional sites relate functionally to the presence of the γ2subunit in the receptor complex. One site is involved in the potentiation of the GABA response and is sensitive to antagonism by Zn2+. The other site may participate in the acceleration of the desensitization of the GABA-gated current, an effect insensitive to Zn2+. At a concentration of 3 × 10−6m or higher, DHA is a noncompetitive antagonist of GABAA receptor responses in α1β2γ2s (Fig. 1) and α1β2 (Fig. 6) receptor subunit combinations. A similar inhibitory effect of DHA has been reported on native GABAA receptor complexes of acutely dissociated neurons from rat substantia nigra (7Hamano H. Nabekura J. Ogawa T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). On the other hand, DHA has been shown to potentiate the N-methyl-d-aspartic acid responses of dissociated rat nigra neurons (7Hamano H. Nabekura J. Ogawa T. J. Neurophysiol. 1996; 75: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) as well as cortical neurons (4Nishikawa M. Kimura S. Akaike N. J. Physiol. 1994; 475: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The present results suggest that DHA selectively inhibits the function of the GABAA receptor-chloride ion channel complexes. The inhibitory action of DHA is time- and concentration-dependent (Figs. 1 and 6). In addition, the DHA-induced inhibition of I GABA ceases only slowly after the removal of DHA from the extracellular solution. There are several possible explanations for the gradual action of DHA on the GABAA receptor-channel complex. First, the suppression of the GABA response by fatty acids might be mediated through an intracellular second messenger system, since fatty acids have been shown to enhance the diacylglycerol-dependent activation of protein kinase C (23McPhail L.C. Clayton C.C. Snyderman R. Science. 1984; 224: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) and to increase the level of free intracellular Ca2+ (24Calderaro V. Parrillo C. Balestrieri M.L. Giovane A. Filippelli A. Rossi F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 737-746PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GABAAreceptor-Cl− channel complex has been reported to be modulated by intracellular Ca2+ (27Inoue M. Oomura Y. Yakushiji T Akaike N. Nature. 1986; 324: 156-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), by protein kinase A (28Porter N.M. Twyman R.E. Uhler M.D. MacDonald R.L. Neuron. 1990; 5: 789-796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) or by protein kinase C (13McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar, 26Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present results show that neither chelerythrine, a protein kinase C inhibitor, H-89, a protein kinase A inhibitor, nor intracellular BAPTA interfered with the effects of DHA on the GABA response (Fig. 3), suggesting that these intracellular signaling pathways are not involved in the effects of DHA on the GABAA receptor complex. Second, since fatty acids have been shown to be able to modify the membrane fluidity and function of integral membrane proteins (1Stubbs C.D. Smith A.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 779: 89-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1352) Google Scholar), the slow onset of the action of DHA might be explained by changes induced in the lipid microenvironment of the GABAAreceptor-chloride ion channel complex. However, this explanations seem improbable since among various structurally closely related fatty acids examined, only DHA and AA affect the GABA responses (Fig. 5). AA and DHA have been shown to inhibit muscimol-induced Cl− uptake in rat cerebral cortical synaptosomes (29Schwartz R.D. Yu X. Brain Res. 1992; 585: 405-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Likewise, free fatty acids have been shown to decrease the binding oftert-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, which has been proposed to bind at the Cl− channel domain (10Koenig J.A. Martin I.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 44: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 30Samochocki M. Strosznajder J. Neurochem. Int. 1993; 23: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be concluded that DHA and AA bind to a site close to the Cl− channel, acting as a Cl− channel blocker. A distinct action of DHA on the GABA response is to accelerate the desensitization ofI GABA after the peak response in α1β2γ2s GABAAreceptor subunit combinations. This change in the desensitization kinetics was observed at DHA concentration as low as 10−7m, and showed both slow development and recovery (Fig. 1). In contrast, DHA did not change the desensitization of α1β2 GABAA receptor subunit combinations (Fig. 6). A striking action of DHA on the GABAA response is that DHA (10−6m) potentiated the peakI GABA in α1β2γ2s GABAAreceptor combinations, this effect was absent in α1β2 GABAA receptor combinations. The potentiating effect of DHA is obvious when GABA concentrations lower than 10−4m was applied, no potentiation was observed at GABA concentrations of 10−4m or higher (Fig. 2 B). Although this might be due to the limitation of the Y-tube application system (22Murase K. Randic M. Shirasaki T. Nakagawa T. Akaike N. Brain Res. 1990; 525: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar), another plausible explanation might be a “ceiling effect,” since the GABA concentration of 10−4m to 10−3m induces the maximal current response achievable in a given cell and therefore masks potentiating effects of DHA. The very rapid desensitization ofI GABA induced by higher concentrations of GABA itself in addition to the accelerated desensitization induced by DHA might reduce the true peak current. Unlike the slow inhibition of GABA response by DHA (Fig. 1), the potentiation ofI GABA was apparent even if DHA (10−6m) was applied simultaneously with GABA. The high affinity benzodiazepine binding within the GABAAreceptor complex is dependent on the presence of the γ2(or γ3) subunit (31McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). Unsaturated free fatty acids increase the benzodiazepine binding on the GABAA receptors in native (11Witt M.R. Nielsen M. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and recominant (12Witt M.R. Westh-Hansen S.E. Rasmussen P.B. Hastrup S. Nielsen M. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 2141-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) GABAA receptor chloride channel complexes. Free fatty acids interact with a GABAAreceptor subunit configuration that requires the presence of a γ2 subunit. The potentiation of the GABA response on one hand and the increased desensitization of GABA responses on the other seem to be independent of each other since: 1) the development of the acceleration of desensitization is a slow, while the potentiation of the GABA response by DHA is a rapid phenomenon (Fig. 1 A,a); and 2) divalent cations blocked the potentiation of GABA response by DHA, but the desensitization was not affected (Fig. 4). The existence of a fatty acid binding domain has been reported for theN-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor channel complex (32Petrou S. Ordway R.W. Singer J.J. Walsh J.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 41-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and the binding of fatty acids to the specific binding domain induces a conformational change of the protein (33Honma Y. Niimi M. Uchiumi T. Takahashi Y. Odani S. J. Biochem. Tokyo. 1994; 116: 1025-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The present data suggest that the binding of unsaturated fatty acids to a specific binding site near or at the γ2 subunit results in a conformational change of the GABAA receptor complex which leads to an alteration of the response to GABA, e.g. the potentiation of the I GABA and the acceleration of the desensitization of the GABAA receptor composed of α1β2γ2s subunit combinations. In accordance with previous findings (34Draguhn A. Verdorn T.A. Eweri M. Seeburg P.H. Sakmann B. Neuron. 1990; 5: 781-788Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), Zn2+ blocked the GABAA receptor response. Our experiment demonstrated that α1β2 GABAA receptor complexes were 3 orders of magnitude more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of Zn2+ than at α1β2γ2 GABAAreceptor subunit combinations. This result indicates that the presence of γ2s subunits render the GABAAreceptor-channel complex less sensitive to Zn2+. The binding site for Zn2+ on the GABAAreceptor-channel complex has been reported to be located at the extracellular part of the Cl− channel complex, resulting in a reduction of the opening frequency of the Cl− channel (35Kilic G. Moran O. Cherubini E. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Zn2+ (10−5m) inhibited the potentiation of the GABAA receptor response induced by 10−6m DHA in α1β2γ2s GABAAreceptor subunit combinations (Fig. 4). At least four possible mechanisms of action for this effect can be suggested. 1) Zn2+ could inhibit the binding of GABA to the receptor in α1β2γ2s receptor combinations. However, since a similar concentration-response relationship for GABA in the absence or presence of 10−5m Zn2+ is observed 2J. Nabekura, K. Noguchi, M.-R. Witt, M. Nielsen, and N. Akaike, unpublished data. this explanation is unlikely. 2) Zn2+ could reduce the bioactivity of DHA. However, since the desensitization of I GABA is equally affected by DHA (10−6m) in the absence or presence of 10−5m Zn2+(Fig. 4 A), this explanation is improbable. 3) Zn2+ could influence the binding of DHA to a site at the γ2s subunit. 4) Zn2+ could interfere with the interaction between γ subunits and other subunits of the GABAA receptor. DHA and AA are abundant fatty acids in the brain tissue. The respective concentration of DHA and AA are 17 and 12% (by weight) of total fatty acids in the adult rat brain (36Dhopeshwarkar G.A. Subramanian C. Lipids. 1975; 10: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These fatty acids can be released from membrane phospholipids by the action of phospholipase A2 (2Piomelli D. Greengard P. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1990; 11: 367-373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The physiological relevant concentration of these fatty acids in the neuron has been estimated to be 1–10 μm (37Piomelli D. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar). An increase in phospholipase activity occurring in, e.g. ischemia and epilepsy, will cause a transient rise of the concentration of free fatty acids by more than several times (37Piomelli D. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 65-83PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+ is found throughout the brain, being concentrated in the particular areas such as cortex and hippocampus (38Donaldson J. Pierre T.S. Minnich J.L. Barbeau A. Can. J. Biochem. 1973; 51: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It is of particular interest that Zn2+ is concentrated in the synaptosomes (39Huag F.S. Histochemie. 1967; 8: 355-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and Zn2+ has been shown to be released from the nerve terminal (40Xie X. Smart T.G. Nature. 1991; 349: 521-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The present result suggest a variety of actions of DHA and AA on the activity of GABAA receptor channel complex and emphasize the importance of the lipid microenvironment for the activity of ligand-gated ionic channels. The combination of three factors, namely, the concentration of DHA and AA, the subunit composition of the GABAA receptor complexes and the presence of Zn2+ induce a whole spectrum of potential modulatory mechanisms affecting GABAA response complexes in the central nervous system."

In this study, we sought to determine the subcellular localization of ACAT in macrophages. Using mouse peritoneal macrophages and immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that a major portion of ACAT was in a dense reticular cytoplasmic network and in the nuclear membrane that colocalized with the luminal endoplasmic reticulum marker protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) and that was in a similar distribution as the membrane-bound endoplasmic reticulum marker ribophorin. Remarkably, another portion of the macrophage ACAT pattern did not overlap with PDI or ribophorin, but was found in as yet unidentified cytoplasmic structures that were juxtaposed to the nucleus. Compartments containing labeled β-very low density lipoprotein, an atherogenic lipoprotein, did not overlap with the ACAT label, but rather were embedded in the dense reticular network of ACAT. Furthermore, cell-surface biotinylation experiments revealed that freshly harvested, non-attached macrophages, but not those attached to tissue culture dishes, contained ∼10–15% of ACAT on the cell surface. In summary, ACAT was found in several sites in macrophages: a cytoplasmic reticular/nuclear membrane site that overlaps with PDI and ribophorin and has the characteristics of the endoplasmic reticulum, a perinuclear cytoplasmic site that does not overlap with PDI or ribophorin and may be another cytoplasmic structure or possibly a unique subcompartment of the endoplasmic reticulum, and a cell-surface site in non-attached macrophages. Understanding possible physiological differences of ACAT in these locations may reveal an important component of ACAT regulation and macrophage foam cell formation.

Understanding possible physiological differences of ACAT in these locations may reveal an important component of ACAT regulation and macrophage foam cell formation. Macrophages enter atherosclerotic lesions at an early stage and are found at all stages of lesion development thereafter (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Several studies have provided evidence that macrophages play an important role in both lesion initiation and late lesion complications (2Smith J.D. Trogan E. Ginsberg M. Grigaux C. Tian J. Miyata M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8264-8268Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 3Libby P. Clinton S.K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1993; 4: 355-363Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A major property of lesional macrophages is their tendency to become massively loaded with cholesteryl ester, a process known as foam cell formation because the numerous cholesteryl ester droplets give the cells a foamy appearance (1Ross R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 791-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). The pathway by which macrophages accumulate cholesteryl ester is complex and not completely understood. Data from several laboratories suggest that macrophages internalize cholesterol through the uptake of certain “atherogenic” lipoproteins or by direct uptake of lipoprotein cholesterol. When the cellular cholesterol content increases to a certain threshold level, mixed pools of lipoprotein-derived and cellular cholesterol gain access to an integral membrane enzyme called ACAT, 1The abbreviations used are: ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol O-acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; β-VLDL, β-very low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay. 1The abbreviations used are: ACAT, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol O-acyltransferase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; β-VLDL, β-very low density lipoprotein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay.which then catalyzes the esterification of the cholesterol to fatty acid via a fatty acyl-CoA intermediate (4Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Given the importance of macrophage foam cells in atherosclerosis, there is much interest in how the cholesterol esterification pathway is regulated. Cholesterol esterification by ACAT increases manyfold when macrophages are incubated with atherogenic lipoproteins, yet ACAT mRNA and protein do not increase under these conditions (5Wang H. Germain S.J. Benfield P.P. Gillies P.J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Tabas I. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12175-12181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Rather, the major regulatory mechanism appears to involve access of membrane-bound ACAT to its hydrophobic substrate cholesterol (4Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). When access to cholesterol is provided, ACAT activity increases by an allosteric mechanism as well as by substrate availability (4Tabas I. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1995; 6: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 7Chang T.Y. Chang C.C.Y. Cheng D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 613-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Therefore, understanding how intracellular pools of cholesterol contact ACAT is an important goal in elucidating the regulation of the cholesterol esterification pathway and foam cell formation. To understand how ACAT gains access to cholesterol, it is necessary to determine the cellular location of ACAT. Studies have shown that plasma membrane cholesterol is a major source of substrate for ACAT (8Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that plasma membrane vesiculation, perhaps as a means of transporting cholesterol to ACAT, is necessary for the stimulation of the cholesterol esterification pathway by atherogenic lipoproteins (10Skiba P.J.

Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies employing subcellular fractionation of rat liver concluded that ACAT is located in the rough ER (12Balasubramanian S. Venkatesen S. Mitropoulos K.A. Peters T.J. Biochem. J. 1978; 174: 863-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and Changet al. (13Chang C.C.Y. Chen J. Thomas M.A. Cheng D. Del Priore V.A. Newton R.S. Pape M.E. Chang T. J. Biol.

Given the inherent flaws of subcellular fractionation studies and the importance of the ACAT pathway in macrophages, we undertook a detailed examination of ACAT localization in macrophages. Herein, we report that much of ACAT in macrophages is in a dense reticular cytoplasmic network and in the nuclear membrane that colocalized with the luminal endoplasmic reticulum marker PDI and that was in a similar distribution as the membrane-bound endoplasmic reticulum marker ribophorin. A noticeable portion of ACAT in macrophages, however, resides in a perinuclear cytoplasmic site that does not overlap with PDI or ribophorin. Furthermore, using a cell-surface biotinylation protocol, we found that a portion of ACAT was on the cell surface of freshly harvested, non-attached peritoneal macrophages. These findings may have implications regarding the regulation of the cholesterol esterification pathway and macrophage foam cell formation. Falcon and Corning tissue culture plasticware was purchased from Fisher. Tissue culture media and reagents and calf serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc., and fetal bovine serum was purchased from Gemini Bioproducts (Calabasas, CA). Mouse IgG2a and anti-mouse CD12/CD32 Fc receptor antibody were from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA) and Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), respectively. The anti-ACAT antiserum used in our immunofluorescence studies was made by injecting rabbits with a fusion protein consisting of the amino-terminal 120 residues of murine ACAT and glutathioneS-transferase (14Meiner V. Tam C. Gunn M.D. Dong L. Weisgraber K.H. Novak S. Myers H.M. Erickson S.K. Farese Jr., R.V. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1928-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For the immunoblot experiments displayed in Fig. 5, we used an antiserum that was raised in rabbits against a synthetic peptide consisting of the 40 C-terminal amino acids of human ACAT (cf.

Chicken anti-PDI serum was a generous gift from Dr. Ron Raines (Department of Biochemistry, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and rabbit anti-ribophorin serum was kindly provided by Dr. Gert Kreibich (Department of Cell Biology, New York University Medical School, New York, NY). Rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit and anti-chicken IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. (West Grove, PA), and Oregon green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). β-VLDL was prepared from the sera of rabbits fed a high fat, high cholesterol diet (2% cholesterol and 10% soy bean oil) as described previously (16Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and conjugated to Texas Red (Molecular Probes, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma. Resident macrophages were harvested from the peritonea of 25–30-g female ICR mice, C57BL6/129 hybrid mice from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), or ACAT knockout (ACAT−/−) mice in the C57BL6/129 hybrid background (17Meiner V.L.

For the immunofluorescence experiments, the macrophages were plated on 35-mm dishes with a coverslip beneath a 7-mm hole in the bottom (106 cells/dish) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 292 μg/ml glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin as described (19Salzman N.H. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2097-2104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Macrophages were washed with the supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium indicated above and fixed for 10 min either with cold methanol (−20 °C) on ice or with 2% paraformaldehyde in 150 mmNaCl, 20 mm Hepes, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4 (Medium 1), at room temperature, followed by three washes with Medium 1. After fixation, all treatments were performed at room temperature. Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were permeabilized for 15 min with 100 μg/ml saponin in Medium 1 containing 5 mm ammonium chloride to react with aldehyde groups. Methanol- or paraformaldehyde-fixed cells were treated for 30 min with Medium 2 (Medium 1 plus 10% calf serum) containing 50 μg/ml purified mouse IgG2a and 25 μg/ml purified anti-mouse CD12/CD32 Fc receptor antibody (blocking solution) to inhibit the interactions of antibodies with Fc receptors and to decrease nonspecific binding of antibodies. Primary antibodies diluted in Medium 2 were applied for 1 h. The cells were washed three times with Medium 1, incubated with rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-chicken IgG at 6 μg/ml or with Oregon green-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 20 μg/ml in Medium 2, and washed again three times with Medium 1. For double immunofluorescence experiments, the labeling procedure was repeated with the second set of antibodies. For colocalization studies involving β-VLDL, macrophages were treated with 5 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated β-VLDL in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 0.2% bovine serum albumin for 10 min at 37 °C, fixed and permeabilized with cold methanol (−20 °C) on ice, and labeled with the rabbit anti-ACAT serum. The cells were observed with a Zeiss LSM 410 confocal microscope using an argon-krypton laser (488 and 568 nm excitation) and a 100× objective (NA 1.4) or with a Bio-Rad MRC 600 microscope using an argon laser (514 nm excitation) and a 63× objective (NA 1.4). The images were processed with Metamorph (Universal Imaging Corp.) and Photoshop (Adobe) software. We utilized a modification of the procedure of Rodriguez-Boulan and co-workers (20Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. Graeve L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Resident mouse peritoneal macrophages were freshly harvested from 14 female ICR mice (see above) and washed once with PBS by low speed centrifugation. One-half of the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin (Pierce) for 40 min at 4 °C with gentle rotation, centrifuged at 1700 rpm for 5 min, and resuspended in PBS. The cells were repelleted and then resuspended in 50 mm ammonium acetate in PBS and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After washing twice with PBS, the cells were resuspended in RIPA buffer (0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm EDTA, pH 8) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors. After incubation for 30 min, the lysate was centrifuged (13,000 × g for 10 min). The supernatant was precleared with unconjugated agarose (CL-6B-200, Sigma), which had been prewashed three times with RIPA buffer, for 2 h with rotating. The agarose was pelleted (13,000 × g for 10 s), and the supernatant was added to immunopure immobilized streptavidin (Pierce), which had been prewashed with RIPA buffer, and incubated with gentle rotation for 18 h. The precipitates were then centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for 10 s; the supernatants were removed; and the agarose was resuspended in RIPA buffer. This washing step was repeated twice with RIPA buffer, twice with RIPA buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and three times with PBS. The agarose was resuspended with an appropriate volume of buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol, heated to 37 °C for 30 min, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 45 s, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. To assess total membrane-bound ACAT in the macrophages for comparison on the immunoblot, the other half of the macrophages were disrupted at 4 °C by sonication (Model 450, Branson Ultrasonics Corp., Danbury, CT) in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml NHS-SS-biotin and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). After 40 min of incubation at 4 °C, the macrophages were spun at 100,000 ×g for 45 min at 4 °C to pellet cellular membranes. The pellet was resuspended in 50 mm ammonium acetate in PBS (quenching buffer) containing protease inhibitors, incubated for 10 min, and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 45 min. The final membrane pellet was resuspended with an appropriate volume of buffer containing 1% SDS and 10 mm dithiothreitol, heated to 37 °C for 30 min, centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 45 s, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Samples were electrophoresed on 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted as described using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce Super Signal kit) (21Marathe S. Schissel S.L. Yellin M.J. Beatini N. Mintzer R. Williams K.J. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4081-4088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-ACAT (1:1000), anti-β1-integrin (1:3000), anti-ribophorin (1:3000), and chicken anti-PDI (1:3000); the secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and anti-chicken IgG (1:20,000). To determine the specificity of the anti-ACAT antibody for our immunofluorescence studies, we used confocal microscopy to compare the labeling pattern of adherent peritoneal macrophages from wild-type mice with that of macrophages from ACAT−/− mice. In 12 0.6-μm-thick confocal projections, we observed that wild-type macrophages labeled with the anti-ACAT serum exhibited a bright pattern of staining that included the nuclear envelope and a dense reticular network throughout the cell (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, the staining of these cells with preimmune serum generated a very dim and diffuse fluorescent signal (Fig. 1 A). The data for ACAT−/− macrophages are shown in Fig. 1 (C(preimmune) and D (immune)). In both cases, the staining was dim and diffuse, similar to the preimmune staining of wild-type macrophages. These results show that the anti-ACAT serum is specific for the native ACAT protein and can be used in immunofluorescence experiments to determine the localization of ACAT. The pattern of ACAT staining in Fig. 1 B was consistent with the cellular distribution of an ER-associated protein. To further examine this point, we compared the localization of ACAT with that of PDI, a protein known to reside in the lumen of almost all of the subcompartments of the ER (22Noiva R. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3553-3556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sitia R. Meldolesi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 (A–I) shows single confocal slices of macrophages double-labeled with anti-ACAT (green) and anti-PDI (red) antibodies. In a minority of cells, the two markers colocalized perfectly; there was a complete overlap of the nuclear envelope and the reticular network patterns (Fig. 2,A–C). In most of the cells, however, the comparison between the ACAT and PDI distributions was more complex. Although many structures labeled with the anti-ACAT (Fig. 2, D andG) and anti-PDI (Fig. 2, E and H) antibodies, including the nuclear envelope and part of the reticular network, were identical, there were regions of non-overlap. In particular, there was prominent ACAT labeling near the nucleus that did not overlap with the PDI distribution (Fig. 2, F andI, arrows). Similar data were obtained using the J774 murine macrophage cell line (data not shown). Macrophages immunofluorescently stained for ribophorin, a membrane-bound ER marker (24Kreibich G. Czako-Graham M. Grebenau R. Mok W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 8: 279-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), are also shown (Fig. 2, J and K). The distribution of ribophorin looked similar to that of PDI, namely, a cytoplasmic reticular pattern without evidence of “nuclear” staining. Although the non-overlapping ACAT staining sometimes appeared to overlay the nucleus in single optical sections, analysis of stacks of optical sections showed that the ACAT-positive structures were in cytoplasmic protrusions that sometimes projected into the nucleus of macrophages (Fig. 3, arrows inA and C show one cell in which such structures can be observed). Therefore, while much of the ACAT pattern in adherent macrophages is similar to that of PDI and ribophorin, consistent with localization in the ER, a noticeable portion of ACAT resides in a perinuclear cytoplasmic site that does not overlap with PDI or ribophorin. Whether this site represents another cytoplasmic organelle or possibly a unique specialized subcompartment of the ER remains to be determined (see “Discussion”). In previous work, we showed that a portion of the atherogenic lipoprotein β-VLDL resides in deep, wide cell-surface invaginations, called STEMs (surface tubules for entry intomacrophages), when incubated with macrophages for 5–20 min (25Myers J.N. Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Another foam cell-inducing lipoprotein, acetyl low density lipoprotein, also demonstrates prolonged association with the surface of macrophages (26Zha X. Tabas I. Leopold P.L. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 90: 1421-1431Google Scholar, 27Kruth H.S. Skarlatos S.I. Lilly K. Chang J. Irim I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Localization of β-VLDL in STEMs and possibly acetyl low density lipoproteins in their cell-surface sites may be important for the ability of these lipoproteins to stimulate the cholesterol esterification pathway in macrophages (28Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To determine if β-VLDL-containing structures in macrophages are in close proximity to ACAT, we performed double-label fluorescence microscopy. Macrophages were incubated with Texas Red-conjugated β-VLDL for 10 min before fixing the cells for the immunolocalization of ACAT. We found no overlap of the ACAT label (Fig. 4,A and D) with the β-VLDL label (Fig. 4,B and E), which appeared to be contained in discrete structures (Fig. 4, C and F); in fact, the β-VLDL-containing structures often appeared as holes in the ACAT labeling (G, arrows). Nonetheless, labeled β-VLDL particles were often found in close proximity to the reticular structures containing ACAT (Fig. 4, C and F). Thus, while there was no specific concentration of ACAT in or around the β-VLDL structure, the dense network of the ACAT-containing ER surrounds β-VLDL-containing STEMs and endosomes. Plasma membrane cholesterol is a major source of substrate for ACAT (8Tabas I. Rosoff W.J. Boykow G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1266-1272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Lange Y. Strebel F. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13838-13843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and foam cell-inducing lipoproteins demonstrate prolonged association with the surface of macrophages (see above). Therefore, we sought to determine whether a portion of ACAT might be localized on the cell surface. Initial immunofluorescence studies in which the antibodies were added to non-fixed and non-permeabilized macrophages at 4 °C were difficult to interpret due to a high level of nonspecific staining (i.e. staining found in ACAT−/− cells). To rectify this problem, we conducted a series of cell-surface biotinylation/immunoblot experiments (cf. Ref. 20Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. Graeve L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this protocol, intact cells are incubated with a biotinylation reagent at 4 °C to derivatize cell-surface, but not intracellular, proteins. After the biotinylation reagent is quenched, the cells are then solubilized with detergent, precipitated with immobilized streptavidin, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Most important, the immunoblot analysis includes antibodies against known intracellular proteins to prove that the biotinylation reagent did not have access to the intracellular compartment. As a means of comparison, we also performed immunoblot analysis of biotinylated membranes from a total cell homogenate; these membranes were biotinylated to control for any differences in immunoreactivity due to antigen derivatization by biotin. For some biotinylation experiments, we used the ACAT N-terminal antibody employed in our immunofluorescence experiments (see above), although we found that biotinylation of ACAT caused a decrease in immunoreactivity with this antibody. Another antibody that was raised against a C-terminal peptide of ACAT, however, reacted equally well with underivatized and biotinylated ACAT (data not shown), and so we used this antiserum for the experiments described below. We initially conducted these experiments using macrophages plated on cell culture dishes. There was no cell-surface biotinylation of ACAT; a positive control, the cell-surface protein β1-integrin, was amply biotinylated (data not shown). Similar results were obtained when adherent macrophages were examined 1 h after plating or when they were plated on Millicell-CM 0.4-μm culture plate inserts placed in 35-mm wells, followed by addition of the biotinylation reagent to both the upper and lower chambers to make sure there was access to the adherent lower surface (see Ref. 20Sargiacomo M. Lisanti M. Graeve L. Le Bivic A. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Membr. Biol. 1989; 107: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We then conducted this protocol on freshly harvested macrophages in suspension. Fig. 5 A shows the immunoblots using the anti-ACAT antibody. The lane labeled TM refers to biotinylated total membranes from the cell homogenates (i.e.total cellular ACAT) derived from a given number of cells; the -fold notations under the three cell-surface lanes refer to cell-surface material derived from 2.5-, 5-, and 10-fold the number of cells that were used for the total membrane lane, respectively. In contrast to our finding with attached cells, there was an amount of cell-surface ACAT in the freshly harvested, non-attached macrophages equivalent to between one-fifth and one-tenth of total cellular ACAT. In five repeat experiments, we found that cell-surface ACAT averaged between 10 and 15% of total cellular ACAT, and similar results were found when we used the N-terminal antibody with the J774 macrophage cell line (data not shown). No band was seen in either total membranes or cell-surface material when freshly harvested macrophages from ACAT−/−mice were subjected to this protocol (data not shown). As mentioned above, a critical control for these experiments is to determine access of the biotinylation reagent to the intracellular compartment. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the rough ER membrane-bound protein ribophorin (24Kreibich G. Czako-Graham M. Grebenau R. Mok W. Rodriguez-Boulan E. Sabatini D.D. J. Supramol. Struct. 1978; 8: 279-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) shows a very faint cell-surface signal at 10-fold in comparison with a very bright total membrane signal. Densitometry revealed <1% biotinylation of ribophorin, and similar data were obtained with PDI (data not shown). Fig. 5 C shows data for β1-integrin, a protein known to be heavily concentrated on the cell surface (29Hynes R.O. Cell. 1987; 48: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3071) Google Scholar); as expected, ∼50% of β1-integrin is on the surface of macrophages. In summary, ∼10–15% of ACAT in freshly harvested, non-attached macrophages is exposed to the extracellular space. The ACAT pathway in macrophages plays a key role in foam cell formation during atherogenesis, and previous work from our laboratories and others has suggested that determining the intracellular location of ACAT in macrophages may provide important clues to its regulation. Herein, we show that much of ACAT is in a dense, widespread reticular network throughout the cytoplasm that overlaps with the luminal ER marker PDI and that has a pattern similar to that of the membrane ER marker ribophorin. In addition, our studies have demonstrated two surprising observations. First, a portion of ACAT in most of the cells we observed was present in a perinuclear cytoplasmic site that does not overlap with PDI or ribophorin. Second, 10–15% of ACAT in non-attached macrophages was present on the cell surface. The finding that much of ACAT is in the ER of macrophages allows us to focus our hypotheses on how atherogenic lipoproteins stimulate the cholesterol esterification pathway. ACAT esterifies mostly plasma membrane-derived cholesterol after cellular cholesterol reaches a threshold level (30Xu X.Y. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17040-17048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and vesicular transport is important in this process (10Skiba P.J. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13392-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 11Lange Y. Ye J. Strebel F. J. Lipid Res. 1995; 36: 1092-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these observations suggest a model in which plasma membrane-derived vesicles “percolate” through the dense network of the cholesterol-poor, ACAT-containing ER and, if the cholesterol content of these vesicles is high enough (i.e.above threshold), cholesterol is transferred to ACAT down a concentration gradient. The nature of the ACAT-containing perinuclear site that is distinct from PDI and ribophorin remains to be identified. Although this site could be a specialization of the ER, almost all subcompartments of the ER, including ACAT-rich mitochondrion-associated membranes (31Rusinol A.E. Cui Z. Chen M.H. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27494-27502Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), contain PDI (23Sitia R. Meldolesi J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1067-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). 2J. E. Vance, personal communication. Therefore, it is possible that the site is one of several non-ER organelles that concentrate near the nucleus, such as the Golgi apparatus, the endocytic recycling compartment, late endosomes, or lysosomes. As mentioned above, most of the cholesterol substrate for ACAT is derived from the plasma membrane; recent data, however, indicate that a smaller portion may be delivered directly from lysosomes or late endosomes following the endocytosis of lipoproteins (32Neufeld E.B. Cooney A.M. Pitha J. Dawidowicz E.A. Dwyer N.K. Pentchev P.G. Blanchette-Mackie E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21604-21613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 33Underwood K.W. Jacobs N.L. Howley A. Liscum L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4266-4274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that perinuclear ACAT, which is in close proximity to perinuclear lysosomes, may be a subpopulation of the enzyme that esterifies lysosomal free cholesterol. This idea and other possible functions of ACAT in the perinuclear site will be further evaluated once this compartment is definitively identified. The finding that a portion of cellular ACAT is on the cell surface of non-attached macrophages, which may be consistent with the findings of Green et al. (34Green S. Steinberg D. Quehenberger O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 218: 924-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) using Xenopus oocytes transfected with ACAT cDNA, raises two important questions: what is the mechanism whereby cell-surface ACAT disappears upon macrophage attachment, and what is the functional importance of ACAT in this site? The disappearance of cell-surface ACAT upon attachment is not due to redistribution of the protein to the basal surface of the cell (see “Results”). One possibility is that one or more signaling pathways known to be activated by cellular attachment to the matrix (e.g. Ref. 35Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) lead to the internalization of cell-surface ACAT. In terms of function, it will be important to determine if ACAT stimulation by a variety of stimuli (cf. Refs. 10Skiba P.J. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Schissel S.L. Tabas I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13392-13400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar and 36Schissel S.L. Beatini N. Zha X. Maxfield F.R. Tabas I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10463-10473Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) differs between attached and non-attached macrophages. Another critical issue related to our finding is whether the active site of ACAT faces the intracellular or extracellular space; studies in rat liver led to the conclusion that the active site of microsomal ACAT faces the cytoplasm (37Lichtenstein A.H. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9098-9104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the proportion of cell-surface ACAT is only 10–15% in non-attached macrophages, ACAT in this site may be functionally important since most of the cholesterol esterified by ACAT is derived from plasma membrane pools (see above), and thus, cell-surface ACAT may provide a direct route for cholesteryl ester synthesis under certain conditions. Several studies from our (16Tabas I. Lim S. Xu X. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 929-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 25Myers J.N. Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) laboratories have shown that foam cell-inducing lipoproteins undergo prolonged contact with the surface of macrophages, an event that may be important in the stimulation of the cholesterol esterification pathway (28Tabas I. Myers J.N. Innerarity T.L. Xu X. Arnold K. Boyles J. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 1547-1560Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In this report, we examined the relationship in location between one such lipoprotein, β-VLDL, and ACAT. We know from previous work that a 10-min incubation of mouse peritoneal macrophages with β-VLDL results in much of the β-VLDL being contained in deep, wide cell-surface invaginations called STEMs (25Myers J.N. Tabas I. Jones N.L. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Herein, we show that “reticular” ACAT (see above) is not contained in these β-VLDL-containing structures, but rather seems to “wrap” around them. From these data, it is tempting to speculate that β-VLDL-derived free cholesterol may be transferred from these structures to nearby ACAT, analogous to and perhaps complementary with the plasma membrane-derived vesicle hypothesis mentioned above. Future fluorescence studies will be directed at determining the trafficking of cholesterol derived from β-VLDL and other atherogenic lipoproteins to ACAT in the cellular sites described in this work. We thank Dr. Ron Raines for the anti-PDI antibody and Dr. Gert Kreibich for the anti-ribophorin antiserum."

Results of the present work suggest that the region comprising the repeated motifs of EPRS provides potential sites for interactions with various biological molecules and thus plays diverse roles in the cell. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential in protein synthesis, catalyzing the attachment of specific amino acids to cognate tRNAs. Despite the common catalytic role of these enzymes, cytoplasmic tRNA synthetases of higher eukaryotes differ from their lower eukaryotic or prokaryotic counterparts in forming a multiprotein complex (1Dang C.V.

These multiprotein complexes are known to contain nine synthetases, which react with Glu, Pro, Ile, Leu, Met, Lys, Gln, Arg, and Asp (5Mirande M. Le Corre D. Waller J.-P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although the presence of this complex in higher eukaryotic cells has been known for the last two decades, its functional significance and structural features remain elusive.Among the tRNA synthetases of higher eukaryotes, glutamyl- and prolyl-tRNA synthetase activities have been found linked in a single polypeptide (6Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 7Fett R. Knippers R. J. Biol.

This leaves the possibility that the linker region may play a distinct role in the cell other than the catalytic function.Peptide sequences homologous to these repeats have also been found in other tRNA synthetases, although they are present as a single copy.

Although it is not clear whether they all play the same role in the cell, the prevalence of these motifs among the eukaryotic tRNA synthetases implies their functional significance.EPRS of Drosophila melanogaster contains six tandem repeats of these motifs between the two catalytic domains. Overexpression of these motifs in transgenic flies resulted in a decrease of fertility (17Cerini C. Semeriva M. Gratecos D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This result further supports the physiological importance of these motifs. It has been proposed that they may serve as a template for assembly of multisynthetase complex or as an anchor to link the complex to other cellular components, such as protein synthesis machinery (6Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 17Cerini C. Semeriva M. Gratecos D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).The three repeated motifs of human EPRS were previously shown to interact with the two repeated motifs present in the C-terminal extension of human cytoplasmic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS) (18Rho S.B.

The tandem repeats in human IRS are distinct from those of EPRS, and their homologues have not been found in other tRNA synthetases (19Nichols R.C. Raben N. Boerkoel C. Plotz P.H. Gene. 1995; 155: 299-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar,20Shiba K. Suzuki N. Shigesada K. Namba Y. Schimmel P. Noda T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7435-7439Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the present work, we further analyzed the molecular interactions of the EPRS repeats with those of IRS and with other cellular molecules. Our results suggest that the peptide region containing the repeated motifs of EPRS is multifunctional and allows for multiple interactions with nucleic acids as well as with at least two different tRNA synthetases. Functional meaning of these interactions will be discussed.DISCUSSIONThe physiological significance of the association between the different eukaryotic tRNA synthetases has been a long-standing question. The structure and function of the multisynthetase complex are thought to be related to the newly evolved unique peptides present in the tRNA synthetases of higher eukaryotes (3Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To get an insight into the functions of these peptides, we focused on the repeated motifs of EPRS located between the two catalytic domains and investigated their structure and interactions. The results of NMR and DSC suggested that these repeats form a stably folded helix-turn-helix (Fig. 1,B and C). The well defined structure of these repeats suggests that they may not be a simple linker of the two catalytic domains. The marginal and spacer regions of the repeated motifs in EPRS contain a high proportion of proline and small amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, and serine. The peptides rich in these residues may form flexible turns between the repeated motifs (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the repeated motifs of EPRS may form a higher order conformation rather than a linear structure. The complex three-dimensional structure of these repeats may be responsible for the multiple interactions with various molecules, as shown in this work.The structure and function of the unique peptides in the eukaryotic tRNA synthetases have been extensively studied in the case of the N-terminal extension of eukaryotic DRS, which is one of the components of the complex. The N-terminal truncated DRS did not associate to the multisynthetase complex in the cell (29Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of the N-terminal extension as a complex association domain. However, this domain, when fused to a heterologous protein, did not drive the protein to the complex. It is thus implied that additional interactions via the connected catalytic domain are required to determine the complex formation of DRS. The N-terminal extension of DRS was also shown to bind to tRNA and elongation factor, thereby facilitating the transfer of the bound aspartyl-tRNA for protein synthesis (39Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reed V.S. Wasteny M.E. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N-terminal extension of DRS plays versatile roles in the cell as a domain responsible for association to tRNA synthetases and other molecules and also as a channel for tRNA delivery.The known functions of the DRS extension can be extrapolated to the case of the EPRS repeats. We demonstrated in the present work that the EPRS repeats are involved in specific interaction with IRS (Figs. 2 and4). The determined dissociation constant between the EPRS and IRS repeats (Fig. 3) is about 100-fold higher than that between DRS and the multisynthetase complex (30Agou F. Mirande M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Assuming that all of the components are bound to the complex with a similar binding stability, the interaction between the repeats of EPRS and IRS may not be strong enough to keep the two proteins within the complex. Thus, assembly of the two enzymes to the native complex should be aided by additional interactions. The association of these proteins to the complex can be further contributed to by the interactions with other molecules attracted to the repeated motifs as well as by the interactions of the catalytic domains of EPRS and IRS. In this work, we showed that the EPRS repeats also bind to the N-terminal extension of RRS (Fig. 4 C). The interaction between the repeats of EPRS with IRS may be stabilized by their additional interaction with RRS.The nucleic acid binding activity of the EPRS repeats (Fig. 5) can function as a channel of tRNA for catalysis and protein synthesis, stabilizer of protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization signal of the synthetase complex. Yeast Arc1p protein bound to cytoplasmic methionyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase showed the binding activity to tRNA (41Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The proposed role of this protein was to facilitate the binding and delivery of tRNA to the catalytic site of the bound tRNA synthetases. Perhaps the EPRS repeats were a functional homologue of yeast Arc1p and later genetically fused to a catalytic domain of various tRNA synthetases during evolution.Although the EPRS repeats were not essential for the activity of the connected tRNA synthetase (8Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorg. Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), overexpression of these repeats inDrosophila resulted in sterility (17Cerini C. Semeriva M. Gratecos D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, a mutation of the gene for yeast Arc1p induced slow growth and cold sensitivity of the cell, although it was not essential for the activities of the bound tRNA synthetases (41Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These results together imply that the in vivo function of the EPRS repeats could be more significant and pleiotropic than what they appear to be from the experimental results of isolated in vitro systems.The results of the present study indicate that there is much similarity between the EPRS repeats and the N-terminal extension of DRS in their structure and interactions. Many other eukaryotic tRNA synthetases also contain unique peptides of similar structural and functional features. All of these peptides are thus expected to play versatile roles in the cell in a similar fashion. The functional versatility would result from the potential of these peptides to accommodate multiple interactions with diverse cellular molecules.Most of the conserved residues among the EPRS repeats are hydrophobic and positively charged (6Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because interactions between eukaryotic tRNA synthetases have been reported to be driven by hydrophobic interactions (2Deutscher M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 99: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 29Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these protein-protein interactions are expected to be mediated by hydrophobic residues of the repeated motifs. In contrast, interactions with nucleic acids are likely to involve charged residues. Thus, the repeated motifs of EPRS may be simultaneously involved in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions using different residues in the motifs. In summary, all of the proposed roles of the unique eukaryotic peptides, including the EPRS repeats, may not be mutually exclusive and can be sequentially or simultaneously achieved in the cell via their versatility of interaction. The complex formation of the tRNA synthetases could provide a means for these peptides to work together in a concerted manner. Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases are essential in protein synthesis, catalyzing the attachment of specific amino acids to cognate tRNAs.

Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), these protein-protein interactions are expected to be mediated by hydrophobic residues of the repeated motifs. In contrast, interactions with nucleic acids are likely to involve charged residues. Thus, the repeated motifs of EPRS may be simultaneously involved in protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions using different residues in the motifs. In summary, all of the proposed roles of the unique eukaryotic peptides, including the EPRS repeats, may not be mutually exclusive and can be sequentially or simultaneously achieved in the cell via their versatility of interaction. The complex formation of the tRNA synthetases could provide a means for these peptides to work together in a concerted manner. The physiological significance of the association between the different eukaryotic tRNA synthetases has been a long-standing question. The structure and function of the multisynthetase complex are thought to be related to the newly evolved unique peptides present in the tRNA synthetases of higher eukaryotes (3Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 4Kisselev L.L. Wolfson A.D. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1994; 48: 83-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To get an insight into the functions of these peptides, we focused on the repeated motifs of EPRS located between the two catalytic domains and investigated their structure and interactions. The results of NMR and DSC suggested that these repeats form a stably folded helix-turn-helix (Fig. 1,B and C). The well defined structure of these repeats suggests that they may not be a simple linker of the two catalytic domains. The marginal and spacer regions of the repeated motifs in EPRS contain a high proportion of proline and small amino acids, such as glycine, alanine, and serine. The peptides rich in these residues may form flexible turns between the repeated motifs (Fig. 1 A). Thus, the repeated motifs of EPRS may form a higher order conformation rather than a linear structure. The complex three-dimensional structure of these repeats may be responsible for the multiple interactions with various molecules, as shown in this work. The structure and function of the unique peptides in the eukaryotic tRNA synthetases have been extensively studied in the case of the N-terminal extension of eukaryotic DRS, which is one of the components of the complex. The N-terminal truncated DRS did not associate to the multisynthetase complex in the cell (29Mirande M. Lazard M. Martinez R. Latreille M.T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 203: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), suggesting a role of the N-terminal extension as a complex association domain. However, this domain, when fused to a heterologous protein, did not drive the protein to the complex. It is thus implied that additional interactions via the connected catalytic domain are required to determine the complex formation of DRS. The N-terminal extension of DRS was also shown to bind to tRNA and elongation factor, thereby facilitating the transfer of the bound aspartyl-tRNA for protein synthesis (39Reed V.S. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32937-32941Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Reed V.S. Wasteny M.E. Yang D.C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32932-32936Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that the N-terminal extension of DRS plays versatile roles in the cell as a domain responsible for association to tRNA synthetases and other molecules and also as a channel for tRNA delivery. The known functions of the DRS extension can be extrapolated to the case of the EPRS repeats. We demonstrated in the present work that the EPRS repeats are involved in specific interaction with IRS (Figs. 2 and4). The determined dissociation constant between the EPRS and IRS repeats (Fig. 3) is about 100-fold higher than that between DRS and the multisynthetase complex (30Agou F. Mirande M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Assuming that all of the components are bound to the complex with a similar binding stability, the interaction between the repeats of EPRS and IRS may not be strong enough to keep the two proteins within the complex. Thus, assembly of the two enzymes to the native complex should be aided by additional interactions. The association of these proteins to the complex can be further contributed to by the interactions with other molecules attracted to the repeated motifs as well as by the interactions of the catalytic domains of EPRS and IRS. In this work, we showed that the EPRS repeats also bind to the N-terminal extension of RRS (Fig. 4 C). The interaction between the repeats of EPRS with IRS may be stabilized by their additional interaction with RRS. The nucleic acid binding activity of the EPRS repeats (Fig. 5) can function as a channel of tRNA for catalysis and protein synthesis, stabilizer of protein-protein interaction, and cellular localization signal of the synthetase complex. Yeast Arc1p protein bound to cytoplasmic methionyl-tRNA synthetase and glutamyl-tRNA synthetase showed the binding activity to tRNA (41Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The proposed role of this protein was to facilitate the binding and delivery of tRNA to the catalytic site of the bound tRNA synthetases. Perhaps the EPRS repeats were a functional homologue of yeast Arc1p and later genetically fused to a catalytic domain of various tRNA synthetases during evolution. Although the EPRS repeats were not essential for the activity of the connected tRNA synthetase (8Heacock D. Forsyth C.J. Shiba K. Musier-Forsyth K. Bioorg. Chem. 1996; 24: 273-289Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar), overexpression of these repeats inDrosophila resulted in sterility (17Cerini C. Semeriva M. Gratecos D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 244: 176-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Similarly, a mutation of the gene for yeast Arc1p induced slow growth and cold sensitivity of the cell, although it was not essential for the activities of the bound tRNA synthetases (41Simos G. Segref A. Fasiolo F. Hellmuth K. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Hurt E.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5437-5448Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These results together imply that the in vivo function of the EPRS repeats could be more significant and pleiotropic than what they appear to be from the experimental results of isolated in vitro systems. The results of the present study indicate that there is much similarity between the EPRS repeats and the N-terminal extension of DRS in their structure and interactions. Many other eukaryotic tRNA synthetases also contain unique peptides of similar structural and functional features. All of these peptides are thus expected to play versatile roles in the cell in a similar fashion. The functional versatility would result from the potential of these peptides to accommodate multiple interactions with diverse cellular molecules. Most of the conserved residues among the EPRS repeats are hydrophobic and positively charged (6Cerini C. Kerjan P. Astier M. Gratecos D. Mirande M. Semeriva M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4267-4277Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because interactions between eukaryotic tRNA synthetases have been reported to be driven by hydrophobic interactions (2Deutscher M.P. J.

Inhibition of NMDA receptors by glycine site antagonists is of major interest for the therapeutic intervention in pathological central nervous system states like stroke, head injury, and epilepsy. At doses evoking remarkable anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects, glycine site antagonists are less prone to psychotomimetic actions and exhibit less severe motoric and cognitive side effects than glutamate site antagonists (22Kemp J.A. Leeson P.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 20-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Further improvements are expected from the targeting of the glycine site of NMDA receptor subtypes. The NR1 subunit harbors main determinants of the glycine binding site in recombinant receptors as well as in situ. Recombinant homomeric NR1 receptors bind glycine agonists and antagonists (19Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 23Grimwood S.

Similarly, in native receptors, the novel glycine antagonist and photoaffinity ligand [3H]CGP 61594 labels exclusively the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors in brain membranes. 2D. Benke, M. Honer, R. Heckendorn, M. F. Pozza, H. Allgeier, C. Angst, and H. Mohler, manuscript in preparation. In contrast, the glutamate binding pocket is formed by the NR2 subunits (29Laube B. Hirai H. Sturgess M. Betz H. Kuhse J. Neuron. 1997; 18: 493-503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the properties of the glycine site are influenced by the type of NR2 subunit that is assembled with the NR1 subunit. Glycine displays an up to 10-fold lower potency at NR1/2A receptors than at NR1/2B, NR1/2C, or NR1/2D receptors, and a similar difference in affinity has also been observed for the glycine site agonistsd-serine, 1-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid,d-alanine, HA-966, and L-687,414 (16Buller A.M.

However, glycine site antagonists (e.g. L-701,324, L-689,560, L-695,902, CKA) did not clearly differentiate between recombinant NMDA receptor subtypes (23Grimwood S. Le Bourdellès B. Whiting P.J. J.

Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 1573-1581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of the NR1 subunit suggested structural differences in the binding domains of glycine site agonists and antagonists (25Hirai H. Kirsch J. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6031-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 26Kuryatov A. Laube B. Betz H. Kuhse J.

Some of the mutated residues affected the affinity for glycine site agonists (d-serine, d-cycloserine, 1-aminocyclobutanecarboxylic acid), but not, or only moderately, for glycine site antagonists (DCKA, L-689,560, L-701,324). It was therefore concluded that glycine antagonists interact with binding domains that are virtually insensitive to modulation by the NR2 subunit variants (21Priestley T. Laughton P. Myers J. LeBourdellès B. Kerby J. Whiting P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 841-848PubMed Google Scholar). This view appeared to preclude the development of subtype-specific glycine site antagonists to differentiate NMDA receptor subtypes. Here we show that the major NMDA receptor subtypes can be distinguished by their differential interaction with the glycine site antagonist CGP 61594. This ligand constitutes a novel tool to identify NR2 subunit domains that contribute, directly or allosterically, to the glycine antagonist binding site. Membranes were prepared from male Sprague-Dawley rat brains,2 frozen, thawed, and washed twice with 5 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, and once with 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4. Aliquots of the membranes (100 μg of protein) were incubated with 25 nm [3H]CGP 61594 (29 Ci/mmol, custom synthesized in tritiated form by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or, for saturation binding experiments, with concentrations ranging from 2 to 200 nm for 2 h on ice in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, in a final volume of 200 μl. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mmglycine and amounted to 20–30% of total binding at 25 nm[3H]CGP 61594.2 At high radioligand concentrations (180 nm), nonspecific binding amounted to about 85% of total binding in cerebellum and to 60–70% of total binding in hippocampus/cortex. After filtration through Whatman GF/C filters, the radioactivity was quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data was performed using the “Ligand” program (35McPherson G.A. J. Pharmacol. Methods. 1986; 14: 213-228Crossref Scopus (1187) Google Scholar). For irreversible labeling, membranes containing 60 μg of protein were incubated with 25 nm [3H]CGP 61594 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, for 2 h on ice, followed by irradiation with UV light in a Stratalinker (1 J at 254 nm; distance: 10 cm). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 1 mm glycine. After centrifugation, the membranes were dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, heated at 60 °C for 30 min and subjected to SDS-PAGE using 5% mini gels. After staining for proteins with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, the gel was incubated in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min, dried, and exposed to an x-ray film (Fuji RX) for at least 2 weeks. Whole brain membranes were photolabeled with 25 nm [3H]CGP 61594 as described above, washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, and solubilized in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 9.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS (RIPA) (36Sheng M.

The supernatant was carefully removed, and aliquots (500 μl) were incubated with NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D antiserum (37Benke D. Wenzel A. Scheurer L. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. J. Recept.

Antigen-antibody complexes were precipitated by incubation with 125 μl of Pansorbin (suspension of 10% Staphylococcus aureus, Calbiochem) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the pellets three times in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2% Triton X-100 the precipitates were resuspended in 200 μl of 50 mmTris/HCl, pH 7.4, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The ability of the different antisera to immunoprecipitate the respective receptor subtype was verified by Western blot analysis of the NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, and NR2D subunits. The regional distribution of [3H]CGP 61594 was analyzed on unfixed parasagittal cryostat-cut sections (12 μm) of brains of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (200–250 g). Slide-mounted sections were thawed and washed three times for 10 min at 4 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5. For [3H]CGP 61594 binding, sections were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with 10 nm [3H]CGP 61594 in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, followed by washing five times for 2 min in buffer. After washing in buffer and a quick dip in distilled water, the sections were dried and exposed to Hyperfilm-3H (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 15 days. Nonspecific [3H]CGP 61594 binding was assessed in parallel in the presence of 1 mm glycine. Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were grown to 50–60% confluence and transfected with the NR1 cDNA alone or in combination with the cDNA encoding the NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D subunit (25 μg total) using the calcium phosphate precipitation method of Chen and Okayama (41Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). In co-transfection cultures, either 5 μm MK-801 and 10 μm DCKA or 500 μm ketamine were added. After overnight incubation (35 °C, 3% CO2), the medium was renewed and the cells incubated for further 24–48 h (37 °C, 5% CO2). The plates were then rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (37 °C, pH 7.5), and the cells were harvested into the same buffer containing 50 mm KCl. The cell suspension was centrifuged (10,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C), and the resultant pellet homogenized (Polytron) in ice-cold 0.32 msucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and centrifuged (1000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). After rehomogenization of the pellet and recentrifugation, the supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 30,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane pellet was washed once in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, and frozen to −70 °C at least overnight. Before the binding experiment, the thawed membrane suspension was washed twice with 5 mmTris acetate, pH 7.0, and once with 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4. Linearized plasmid DNAs were used for the in vitro synthesis of cRNA (mCAP mRNA capping kit, Stratagene). cRNAs of NR1 and NR2A-2D subunits were synthesized using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase, respectively. cRNA concentrations were determined by both measuring optical densities at 260 nm and comparing methylene blue staining intensities after gel electrophoresis. For oocyte injection, the concentration of the cRNA samples was adjusted to 200–500 ng/ml, and diluted aliquots of the NR1 and NR2 cRNAs were mixed at the RNA ratio of 1:1. Microinjection of about 50 nl of cRNA into Xenopus laevis oocytes and voltage-clamp recordings of agonist responses in Mg2+-free frog Ringer's solution at a holding potential of −70 mV were performed as described (42Schmieden V. Grenningloh G. Schofield P.R. Betz H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). [3H]CGP 61594 is a novel glycine site antagonist. Upon photoactivation it is selectively cross-linked to the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors.2 By analyzing the interaction of [3H]CGP 61594 with various NMDA receptor subtypes, the contribution of the NR2 subunit variants to the glycine antagonist domain was investigated. The distribution of [3H]CGP 61594 binding sites was mapped autoradiographically on parasagittal cryostat sections of adult brain. High affinity [3H]CGP 61594 binding was mainly restricted to forebrain regions with highest densities in the hippocampal formation, followed by cerebral cortex, striatum, olfactory bulb, and thalamus (Fig. 1). In mid- and hindbrain areas only marginal labeling of receptors over background was observed (Fig. 1). In contrast, strychnine-insensitive [3H]glycine binding, which recognizes the entire population of NMDA receptors, is detected in virtually all brain areas, including cerebellum and brain stem (43McDonald J.W. Penny J.B. Johnston M.V. Young A.B. Neuroscience. 1990; 35: 653-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 44Laurie D.J. Seeburg P.H. J.

Thus, [3H]CGP 61594 appears to interact with high affinity only with a subpopulation of NMDA receptors. To verify the regional specificity of NMDA receptor labeling by [3H]CGP 61594, high affinity binding sites were identified in crude membranes prepared from various brain regions. No difference in the K D value of high affinity binding of [3H]CGP 61594 was detected among the different brain regions (Table I). The highest maximum number of binding sites (B max values) was observed in the hippocampal formation, followed by the cerebral cortex and striatum. Lower B max values were apparent in olfactory bulb and thalamus, while very low binding was found in brainstem regions (mesencephalon, medulla/pons). In cerebellar membranes high affinity binding sites were not detected, although specific binding detected at high nanomolar concentrations (150–200 nm) pointed to the potential presence of low affinity sites (see below). The rank order of regional high affinity labeling closely corresponded to the labeling pattern observed autoradiographically.Table IAbundance of [ 3 H]CGP 61594 binding sites in different brain regionsBrain regionK DB maxnmpmol/mg proteinHippocampal formation22 ± 16.43 ± 1.07Cerebral cortex25 ± 35.47 ± 0.62Striatum22 ± 14.51 ± 0.53Olfactory bulb25 ± 12.75 ± 0.24Thalamus/Hypothalamus21 ± 12.46 ± 0.61Mesencephalon23 ± 21.54 ± 0.08Medulla/Pons23 ± 20.92 ± 0.07 Open table in a new tab As a photoaffinity ligand, [3H]CGP 61594 is known to interact with the NR1 subunit.2 It was therefore tested whether the molecular target specificity was retained in brain regions containing high affinity [3H]CGP 61594 sites. Following UV irradiation of brain membranes in the presence of 25 nm[3H]CGP 61594, photolabeled proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by fluorography. A single protein with the size of the NR1 subunit (115 kDa) was specifically photolabeled in all brain areas analyzed as shown by its displacement with glycine (Fig. 2). The relative radiolabeling intensity of the 115-kDa protein band varied in different regions with a rank order corresponding to that of the B max values in reversible binding in the respective brain regions. Thus, the molecular specificity of [3H]CGP 61594 photolabeling was retained, and the regional intensity of photolabeling was paralleled by the level of reversibly bound [3H]CGP 61594. The regional distribution of [3H]CGP 61594 binding was strikingly similar to the distribution of the NR2B subunit previously visualized at the level of the mRNA and protein (38Wenzel A. Scheurer L. Künzi R. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40Wenzel A. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. J.

Neurol. 1993; 338: 377-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Furthermore, brain regions that lack expression of the NR2B subunit such as the adult cerebellum (38Wenzel A. Scheurer L. Künzi R. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 40Wenzel A. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. J.

Neurol. 1994; 343: 513-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) also lacked high affinity binding sites for [3H]CGP 61594 (Fig. 1, Table I). Thus, at low nanomolar concentrations [3H]CGP 61594 appears to be selective for NMDA receptors containing the NR2B subunit. In keeping with this notion, high levels of [3H]CGP 61594 binding sites were expected to occur in neonatal brain. At this developmental stage, the subunits NR1 and NR2B are strongly expressed, while the NR2D subunit represents only a minor subunit population and the NR2A and NR2C subunits are hardly detectable or absent at birth (39Wenzel A. Villa M. Mohler H. Benke D. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 1240-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40Wenzel A. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. J.

Neuroreport. 1992; 3: 1138-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Indeed, high affinity [3H]CGP 61594 binding sites were found to be present in neonatal brain at levels close to 50% of that found in adult brain (P 0 (postnatal day):B max = 1.5 ± 0.6 pmol/mg protein,K D = 21 ± 3 nm; adult:B max = 3.2 + 0.7 pmol/mg, K D = 21 ± 3 nm). In addition, in photolabeling experiments only a 115-kDa protein, corresponding to the NR1 subunit, was specifically photolabeled by [3H]CGP 61594 in neonatal brain (not shown). This further supports the notion that [3H]CGP 61594 preferentially recognizes NMDA receptors containing the subunits NR1 and NR2B. To test the hypothesis of a preferential interaction of [3H]CGP 61594 with receptors containing the NR2B subunit in situ, the type of photolabeled receptor was identified. Since the NR1 subunit is selectively photolabeled, immunoprecipitation of labeled receptors with NR2 subunit-selective antisera was expected to unravel the subunit combination displaying high affinity [3H]CGP 61594 sites. Membranes prepared from whole adult brain were photoaffinity-labeled in the presence of 25 nm [3H]CGP 61594 and solubilized with the detergent mixture RIPA (36Sheng M. Cummings J. Roldan L.A. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1994; 368: 144-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). NMDA receptor subtypes were immunoprecipitated with antisera selective for the subunits NR1, NR2A, NR2B, NR2C, or NR2D, and the radioactivity of the immunoprecipitate was measured by liquid scintillation counting. Nonspecifically precipitated radioactivity was determined by co-incubating the antiserum with an excess of the respective peptide antigen. Photolabeled proteins were specifically immunoprecipitated only with the NR1 or NR2B antisera (Fig. 3 A). The amount of radioactivity immunoprecipitated was much higher with the NR1 antiserum than with the NR2B antiserum. This difference may be due to either an excess of free NR1 subunits in brain tissue (50Chazot P.L. Stephenson F.A. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 507-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 51Blahos J., II Wenthold R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15669-15674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) or to differential reactivities of the NR1 and NR2B antisera. The NR2A, NR2C, or NR2D antibodies did not result in specific immunoprecipitation of radioactivity (Fig. 3 A), although the respective NMDA receptor subtypes were immunoprecipitated as verified by the detection of the NR1 subunit by Western blotting (Fig. 3 B). These findings support the view that [3H]CGP 61594 interacts with high affinity with NMDA receptors containing the NR1 and NR2B subunits. The heterogeneity of the glycine sites of NMDA receptors in situwas further analyzed by investigating the potential presence of low affinity binding sites for [3H]CGP 61594 in NMDA receptors other than those containing the NR2B subunit. A competition binding assay was performed in the adult cerebellum, a region that contains almost exclusively the NR2A and NR2C subunits but virtually lacks expression of NR2B and NR2D subunits (38Wenzel A. Scheurer L. Künzi R. Fritschy J.M. Mohler H. Benke D. Neuroreport. 1995; 7: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 46Monyer H. Burnashev N. Laurie D.J. Sakmann B. Seeburg P.H.

[3H]CGP 61594 was used at a concentration of 180 nm, and nonspecific binding was determined with 1 mm glycine or 10 μm CGP 61594. The inhibitory potency of CGP 61594 (IC50) in the cerebellum was found to be of 231 ± 56 nm (n = 4). This value was attributable to NR1/2C or NR1/2A receptors or both. It was therefore tested whether low affinity [3H]CGP 61594 sites were also detected in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, brain areas that express preferentially the NR2A and NR2B subunits and largely lack the NR2C and NR2D subunits (39Wenzel A.

Wheat germ agglutinin fractionation of fluorescein 5-maleimide-labeled tryptic fragments of detergent-solubilized H,K-ATPase showed that a fragment Leu855 to Arg922 of the α subunit was bound to the β subunit. The yeast two-hybrid system showed that the region containing only a part of the seventh transmembrane segment, the loop, and part of the eighth transmembrane segment was capable of giving positive interaction signals with the ectodomain of the β subunit. The sequence in the extracytoplasmic loop close to the eighth transmembrane segment, namely Arg898 to Thr928, was identified as being the site of interaction using this method. We deduced that the sequence Arg898 to Arg922 in the α subunit has strong interaction with the extracytoplasmic domain of the β subunit. Again, using yeast two-hybrid analysis, two different sequences in the β subunit Gln64 to Asn130 and Ala156to Arg188 were identified as association domains in the extracytoplasmic sequence of the β subunit. These data enable identification of major associative regions of the α-β subunits of the H,K-ATPase.

These data enable identification of major associative regions of the α-β subunits of the H,K-ATPase. The gastric H,K-ATPase is a polytopic integral membrane protein belonging to the P type ATPase ion transport family that exchanges H3O+ for K+ to generate gastric acid secretion. This ATPase consists of two noncovalently associated subunits. There is, in the rabbit, a large α subunit of 1035 amino acids with 10 transmembrane segments and a β subunit of 290 amino acids with a single transmembrane segment and with sevenN-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (1Bamberg K. Mercier F. Reuben M.A. Kobayashi Y. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Sachs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, is the only other P type ATPase known to have a β subunit, and the two enzymes share about 60 and 40% amino acid homology in their α and β subunits, respectively (4Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All the catalytic functions of both enzymes are contained within the α subunit, such as the binding sites for ATP, cations, and the phosphorylation consensus sequence, as well as the sites for ouabain binding in the Na,K-ATPase, benzimidazole, and K+-competitive inhibitors in the case of the H,K-ATPase (5Palasis M.

Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).There is considerable evidence that the β subunit is required for correct assembly of the enzyme. It has been shown for the Na,K-ATPase that the β subunit stabilizes the nascent α subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in targeting the α-β complex to the plasma membrane (7Geering K. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Noguchi S. Higashi K. Kawamura M. J. Biol.

Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prevention of glycosylation of the β subunit also results in inadequate targeting and loss of catalytic function (11Klassen C.H.W. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There are also data showing that modification of the β subunit of either enzyme has an effect on the catalytic function. For example, reduction of the disulfide bonds appears to alter K+ affinity in the case of the Na,K-ATPase (12Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The subunits can be separated using SDS but not with nonionic detergents. Hence there are regions of strong interaction between the two subunits that have both assembly and structural effects on the holoenzyme.The specific regions of interaction between the α and the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase have been investigated by the expression of chimeras of the Na,K-ATPase and the sarcoplasmic Ca-ATPase (13Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-six residues in the extracellular loop between the seventh and eighth transmembrane domains have been implicated as providing the interactive region in the α subunit. The region of the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase near the first S–S bridge in the extracytoplasmic domain is thought to interact with the α subunit (14Fambrough D.M. Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Emerick M. Renaud K.J. Inmam E.M. Hwang B. Takeyasu K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C579-C589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids as well as a conserved proline residue in the loop between the third disulfide bond of the β subunit ectodomain have also been implicated in subunit assembly (15Beggah A.T. Beguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Geering K. Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Merilatt A.M. Horisberger J.D. Mathews P.M. Lemas V. Fambrough D.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1169-C1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the use of the yeast two-hybrid system has indicated that 63 amino acids of the β subunit extracytoplasmic sequence may be a region of interaction with the α subunit (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A specific sequence containing SYGQ was identified as important using alanine scanning mutagenesis. These data suggest that several regions of one or both subunits of the Na,K-ATPase might be involved in α-β interaction.The β subunit of H,K-ATPase can act as a surrogate for the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase in the formation of functional Na,K-pumps inXenopus oocytes (18Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests some common regions of association in the two enzymes. However, the efficiency of assembly is much lower and surrogate activity has not been found in a mammalian cell expression system (19Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since a monoclonal antibody Abl46 raised against rat parietal cells recognized both an extracytoplasmic epitope on the β subunit, between Cys162and Cys178, and an epitope at the putative extacytoplasmic surface of TM7 on the α subunit, between Ala875 and Asp879, it was suggested that those two regions may also be involved in α-β contact (21Mercier F. Bayle D. Besançon M. Joys T. Shin J.M. Lewin M.J.M. Prinz C. Reuben M.A. Soumarmon A. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Sachs G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). More recently, a chimer of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit containing Gln905 to Val930 of rat gastric H,K-ATPase has been shown to preferentially assemble with H,K-ATPase β subunit. This region also contains the sequence, SYGQ, identified as important for the Na,K-ATPase interaction (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 22Wang S.G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additional amino acids in this region must determine selectivity.Here, we have extended our biochemical approach using WGA fractionation of trypsin digested, but now detergent solubilized H,K-ATPase, to define more precisely regions of the α subunit that interact with the β subunit. It was found that the region TM7 to Arg922 was retained by the β subunit on the WGA column. A second independent technique, the yeast two-hybrid system, was also used in this study. The putative extracellular regions of the α and the β subunits of the rabbit H,K-ATPase were cloned as fusion cDNAs with either the DNA binding or the activation domain of the GAL4 transcription factor and all the possible combinations associating one α and one β construct were assayed by the yeast two-hybrid system. Interaction with the ectodomain of the β subunit was detected only with the TM7/loop/TM8 domain of the α subunit. Shorter constructs of both the α and the β subunits allowed us to define one unique smaller region in α, Arg898 to Thr928, and two different regions in the β subunit, Gln64 to Asn30 and Ala156 to Arg188, as interacting. Together with the biochemical data, these results define the sequence Arg898 to Arg922 on the α subunit as being the major region of association with the β subunit.DISCUSSIONIt is now well established that strong interactions between the α and the β subunits of the H,K-ATPase are necessary for the stabilization and targeting of a functional pump to the plasma membrane of transfected cells or Xenopus oocytes and hence presumably to the tubulovesicles or secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell. Identification of domains involved in assembly of this membrane protein can therefore lead to a better understanding of not only the general structure of the pump but also the mechanisms controlling its biosynthesis and trafficking in the parietal cell.Several assembly domains have been partially characterized in both the α and the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase as outlined earlier. There is direct and indirect evidence for the involvement of the TM7/loop/TM8 extracellular α subunit region in α-β assembly of the H,K-ATPase. No specific region of the β subunit of this enzyme has been identified heretofore.In the present study, we extended our previous work using WGA fractionation of tryptic digested solubilized H,K-ATPase. The minimal fragment of α which was able to associate with the β subunit was 8 kDa in length from Leu855 to Arg922. The sequence from Arg922 to Arg948 which includes the TM8 region did not interact significantly with the β subunit by this biochemical assay. Since the association is known to occur in the lumen, the region on the α subunit between TM7 and Arg922was deduced as being involved in α-β interaction. Although direct, this technique does not allow much flexibility in the size of the fragments that can be analyzed given the few tryptic cleavage sites in the loop between TM7 and TM8. Moreover, it can not provide any information on the regions of the β subunit that are important for α-β association, since there is little quantitative cleavage by trypsin of this region. Further, it relies on stability of the interaction in the nonionic detergents used to solubilize the heterodimer.Therefore, we took advantage of the sensitivity of the yeast two-hybrid system for looking for possible interactions between any extracellular fragments of the α and the β subunit of the H,K-ATPase. Several regions analyzed by this method gave auto-activation, but usually it was possible to eliminate or minimize this effect by interchanging the insertion between the activating or the binding domain of the yeast expression vector.The five extracellular domains of the α subunit, as defined with little variation in most structural models proposed today for this subunit, were assayed for their interaction with the entire luminal domain of the β subunit by using this yeast two-hybrid system. An interaction between the ectodomain of the β subunit and only the TM7/loop/TM8 region of α was detected.Since the yeast two-hybrid system detects interaction in the probable absence of glycosylation, these data show that glycosylation of the β subunit is not required for the association with the α subunit. This confirms previous observations (11Klassen C.H.W. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Furthermore, the absence of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains in the β subunit construct showed that neither of those two domains is critical for interaction of the two subunits as assayed here. It has been shown in the case of the Na,K-ATPase, that deletion of the cytoplasmic and most of the transmembrane domain of the chicken β subunit allowed assembly with the α subunit (26Renaud K.J. Inman E.M. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20491-20497Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, analysis of chimeric proteins between β subunits ofXenopus Na,K-ATPase and rabbit H,K-ATPase that were constructed by exchanging their N-terminal plus transmembrane domain and their extracytoplasmic COOH-terminal domain have been interpreted as showing that the transmembrane domain of the β subunit plays an important role for efficient association with α subunits (27Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Beggah A.T. Takeyasu K. Mangeat P. Rossier B.C. Horisberger J.D. Geering K. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that assembly between the α and β ectodomains occurs first and then there is stabilization of the complex by other interactions. Because of its high sensitivity, the yeast two-hybrid system is able to detect weak interactions.No interaction of the β subunit with any of the other extra Q­ND‖DLQ­VED‖DS‖SY‖YG‖GQE‖QQW‖WT‖TFG­YEQ‖QR‖RH,K907–922Na,K894–909Scheme 1. cellular loops of the α subunit was detected other than that contained within the TM7/loop/TM8 region. Although negative results should be viewed with caution since problems may exist in the expression, targeting, and stability of the fusion protein, this result suggests that the two subunits have strong interaction only in the region of the TM7/loop/TM8 domain. This finding confirms our previous biochemical data (20Shin J.M. Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Shorter fragments of the α subunit used in the yeast two-hybrid system allowed us to define one unique region from Arg898to Thr928, as being involved in the interaction with the β subunit. A combination of these results with the biochemical data reported earlier in this study, shows that a region of only 25 amino acids on the α subunit, from Arg898 to Arg922, is the likely region of strong interaction with β. This region contains the four amino acids, SYGQ, shown to be essential for the interaction between the α and the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase by yeast two-hybrid system using alanine scanning mutagenesis and assumed to be similarly important for the H,K-ATPase based on sequence similarity (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). On the other hand, previous work, using resistance to tryptic digestion and ouabain binding, showed that a chimera of the Na,-K-ATPase α subunit containing the region from Gln905 to Val930 of the rat gastric H,K-ATPase preferentially assembled with β subunit of H,K-ATPase (22Wang S.G. Eakle K.A. Levenson R. Farley R.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C923-C930Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, a homologous 17 amino acid sequence of the α subunit of the two enzymes, from position 907 to position 924 in the H,K-ATPase and position 894 to 911 in the Na,K-ATPase, might be a point of stable contact with the β subunit while differences in the sequence in this region can account for selective assembly of the β subunits with their α counterparts. The alignment of this region of the H,K- and Na,K-ATPases as shown in Scheme 1 suggests that differences in this region, such as the smaller number of charged amino acids in the H,K-ATPase sequence may account for the selective association of the two subunits.No experiment on the interactive regions of the β subunit of the H,K-ATPase has been reported. In the present study, we sought direct evidence for assembly of specific H,K-ATPase β fragments with α fragments. Six adjacent fragments of β were analyzed with the yeast two-hybrid system and two domains were found to interact with both the whole TM7/loop/TM8 domain and the shorter Arg898 to Thr928 fragment defined above on the α subunit. The first fragment Gln64 to Asn130 is the extracellular region directly adjacent to the transmembrane domain ending before the first disulfide bond. The second fragment is a 32-amino acid fragment spanning the entire sequence between the second disulfide bond Ala156 to Arg188. This region of interaction was deduced from reactivity of a monoclonal antibody, mAb 146 with both the α and β subunits of the gastric H,K-ATPase (21Mercier F. Bayle D. Besançon M. Joys T. Shin J.M. Lewin M.J.M. Prinz C. Reuben M.A. Soumarmon A. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Sachs G. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1149: 151-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).The location of these two fragments showed that the disulfide bonds in the β subunit are nonessential for the assembly of the heterodimer complex. This was also found to be true in the case of the Na,K-ATPase when using the yeast two-hybrid system (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). However, the expression in Xenopus oocytes of different mutants with a substitution of one or both cysteine residues involved in the three disulfide bonds of the β-subunit of Torpedo californicaNa,K-ATPase has shown that disruption of either the second or the third disulfide bond prevented α-β association (28Noguchi S. Mutoh Y. Kawamura M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It might be that the interactions detected by the yeast two-hybrid system are weak interactions, otherwise not detected by other techniques because of a lower sensitivity. This is consistent with the finding that deletions of up to 146 extracellular amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase result in less efficient assembly with the α subunit (29Hamrick M. Renaud K.J. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24367-24373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Some of the C-terminal hydrophobic amino acids have been shown to be important in correct assembly of the α and β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase in Xenopus oocytes (18Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, the yeast two-hybrid system used here was unable to confirm these data since all the variations tried in the C-terminal region resulted in auto-activation.In summary, both biochemical and yeast two-hybrid analysis have shown that a single region of the α subunit and two regions of the β subunit of the H,K-ATPase are able to associate in the absence of other regions. From the data above, the deduced associative region of the α subunit is contained within the 22 amino acids between Arg898 and Arg922. The selective assembly of chimeras narrows this region down to and the two regions of the extracytoplasmic surface of the β subunit are found between Gln64 and Asn130 and between Ala156and Arg188. The latter sequence is between the second disulfide pair hence disulfide formation is not important for this interaction. Since there is little or no glycosylation of the nuclear transcription factors, the yeast two hybrid system shows that glycosylation is not required for the initial phase of α-β association. The gastric H,K-ATPase is a polytopic integral membrane protein belonging to the P type ATPase ion transport family that exchanges H3O+ for K+ to generate gastric acid secretion. This ATPase consists of two noncovalently associated subunits. There is, in the rabbit, a large α subunit of 1035 amino acids with 10 transmembrane segments and a β subunit of 290 amino acids with a single transmembrane segment and with sevenN-linked glycosylation consensus sequences (1Bamberg K. Mercier F. Reuben M.A. Kobayashi Y. Munson K.B. Sachs G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1131: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 2Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Sachs G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10200-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase, or sodium pump, is the only other P type ATPase known to have a β subunit, and the two enzymes share about 60 and 40% amino acid homology in their α and β subunits, respectively (4Lingrel J.B. Orlowski J. Shull M.M. Price E.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1990; 38: 37-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). All the catalytic functions of both enzymes are contained within the α subunit, such as the binding sites for ATP, cations, and the phosphorylation consensus sequence, as well as the sites for ouabain binding in the Na,K-ATPase, benzimidazole, and K+-competitive inhibitors in the case of the H,K-ATPase (5Palasis M.

Miller M. Hersey S. Sachs G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2345-2355Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that the β subunit is required for correct assembly of the enzyme. It has been shown for the Na,K-ATPase that the β subunit stabilizes the nascent α subunit in the endoplasmic reticulum and plays a role in targeting the α-β complex to the plasma membrane (7Geering K. Kraehenbuhl J.P. Rossier B.C. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2613-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Noguchi S. Higashi K. Kawamura M. J. Biol.

Good P.J. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prevention of glycosylation of the β subunit also results in inadequate targeting and loss of catalytic function (11Klassen C.H.W. Fransen J.A.M. Swarts H.G.P. De Pont H.H.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). There are also data showing that modification of the β subunit of either enzyme has an effect on the catalytic function. For example, reduction of the disulfide bonds appears to alter K+ affinity in the case of the Na,K-ATPase (12Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6737-6743Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The subunits can be separated using SDS but not with nonionic detergents. Hence there are regions of strong interaction between the two subunits that have both assembly and structural effects on the holoenzyme. The specific regions of interaction between the α and the β subunits of the Na,K-ATPase have been investigated by the expression of chimeras of the Na,K-ATPase and the sarcoplasmic Ca-ATPase (13Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Takeyasu K. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8255-8259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Twenty-six residues in the extracellular loop between the seventh and eighth transmembrane domains have been implicated as providing the interactive region in the α subunit. The region of the β subunit of the Na,K-ATPase near the first S–S bridge in the extracytoplasmic domain is thought to interact with the α subunit (14Fambrough D.M. Lemas M.V. Hamrick M. Emerick M. Renaud K.J. Inmam E.M. Hwang B. Takeyasu K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C579-C589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some hydrophobic C-terminal amino acids as well as a conserved proline residue in the loop between the third disulfide bond of the β subunit ectodomain have also been implicated in subunit assembly (15Beggah A.T. Beguin P. Jaunin P. Peitsch M.C. Geering K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14117-14124Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Geering K. Jaunin P. Jaisser F. Merilatt A.M. Horisberger J.D. Mathews P.M. Lemas V. Fambrough D.M. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1169-C1174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the use of the yeast two-hybrid system has indicated that 63 amino acids of the β subunit extracytoplasmic sequence may be a region of interaction with the α subunit (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12366-12372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). A specific sequence containing SYGQ was identified as important using alanine scanning mutagenesis. These data suggest that several regions of one or both subunits of the Na,K-ATPase might be involved in α-β interaction. The β subunit of H,K-ATPase can act as a surrogate for the β subunit of Na,K-ATPase in the formation of functional Na,K-pumps inXenopus oocytes (18Horisberger J.D. Jaunin P. Reuben M.A. Lasater L.S. Chow D.C. Forte J.G. Sachs G. Rossier B.C. Geering K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19131-19134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation suggests some common regions of association in the two enzymes. However, the efficiency of assembly is much lower and surrogate activity has not been found in a mammalian cell expression system (19Gottardi C.J. Caplan M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14342-14347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Sachs G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8642-8646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since a monoclonal antibody Abl46 raised against rat parietal cells recognized both an extracytoplasmic epitope on the β subunit, between Cys162and Cys178, and an epitope at the putative extacytoplasmic surface of TM7 on the α subunit, between Ala875 and Asp879, it was suggested that those two regions may also be involved in α-β contact (21Mercier F.

More recently, a chimer of the Na,K-ATPase α subunit containing Gln905 to Val930 of rat gastric H,K-ATPase has been shown to preferentially assemble with H,K-ATPase β subunit. This region also contains the sequence, SYGQ, identified as important for the Na,K-ATPase interaction (17Colonna T.E. Huynh L. Fambrough D.M. J. Biol.

This unusual phosphatase molecule appears to be composed of four catalytic units on two polypeptide chains. Two major families of protein phosphatases (phosphoprotein phosphatase or PPP and Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase or PPM) catalyze the dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues (1Mumby M.C. Walter G. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 673-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 2Wera S. Hemmings B.A. Biochem. J. 1995; 311: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 3Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 259: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In both eucaryotes and procaryotes, the Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatases are a large and varied family whose defining member is PP2C. 1The abbreviations used are: PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. 1The abbreviations used are: PP2C, protein phosphatase 2C; GST, glutathione S-transferase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. PP2C is present in cells at lower levels than other members of the serine/threonine phosphatase family (4Ingerbritsen T.S. Cohen P. Science. 1983; 221: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). From bacteria to mammals, PP2C is a monomeric protein with a molecular mass range of 40–50 kDa and requires divalent metal ions (Mg2+ or Mn2+) for its activity (5Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that the PP2C proteins are involved in regulating stress response pathways in both procaryotes and eucaryotes. InSaccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the PP2C genes PTC1 and PTC3 were shown to be involved in the regulation of protein kinase cascades that are induced in response to heat shock or osmotic changes (6Shiozaki K. Russel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 7Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In mammalian hepatocytes, PP2C reverses, by dephosphorylating the AMP-activated protein kinase, the inhibition of cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis (8Moore F. Weeks J. Hardie H.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Bacillus subtilis, the protein phosphatase SpoIIE regulates the steady-state level of phosphorylation of SpoIIAA, an anti-transcription factor, to control sporulation in response to ADP/ATP ratios (9Duncan L. Alper S. Arigoni F. Losick R. Stragier P. Science. 1995; 270: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Bork P. Brown N.P. Hegyi H. Schultz J. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). WIP1, a human PP2C-like gene, has been isolated as a transcript that is highly expressed in response to ionizing radiation (11Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande W.E. Woulde G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Some proteins in the Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatase family contain, in addition to a catalytic region, a domain involved in other physiological functions. Thus, the N-terminal region of ABI1 in Arabidopsis thaliana contains a consensus sequence for a calcium-binding EF-hand (12Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.-C. Guerrier D. Cheldorf F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 264: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 13Meyer K. Leube M.P. Grill E. Science. 1994; 264: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This domain may gauge the level of calcium in the cytoplasm in response to abscisic acid hormone and determine the level of phosphorylated proteins required for the maintenance of the cell cycle or stomatal aperture (13Meyer K. Leube M.P. Grill E. Science. 1994; 264: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). SpoIIE ofB. subtilis contains a region with 10 membrane-spanning segments (9Duncan L. Alper S.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1421-1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), and the S. cerevisiae adenylate cyclase contains an upstream region of 300 amino acids that shares sequence similarity with PP2C (14Tamura S. Lynch K.R. Larner J. Fox J. Yasui A. Kikushi K. Suzuki Y. Tsuiki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This work describes the isolation of a PP2C-like protein, PfPP2C, from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. Each year,P. falciparum is estimated to kill between 1.5 and 2.7 million people, the majority of whom are children under five (15Butler D. Nature. 1997; 386: 535-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Because the parasite and mosquitoes have developed resistance to drugs and pesticides, the identification of new targets for prophylaxis and treatment is urgently needed. The P. falciparum PP2C is composed of two active phosphatases fused together. The two units of PfPP2C complement a yeast deletion mutant, suggesting that this protein, like its homologues, may be active in response to osmolarity changes or other stress. PfPP2C may play a role in protecting the parasite against changes in the erythrocyte environment during infection. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in TableI.

Trager, Rockefeller University) was grown using the method developed by Trager and Jensen (16Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6161) Google Scholar). Albumax replaced serum in the culture medium. All enzyme reactions, DNA and RNA extractions, and hybridization preparations were performed as described by Maniatis et al. (17Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). Yeast transformation was performed as described by Elble (18Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Infected red blood cells from a 12-ml plate were treated with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. After centrifugation at 1875 ×g for 10 min, the pellet was washed in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 500 μl of phosphate-buffered saline. After sonication, the samples were heated for 10 min at 95 °C and loaded onto 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After migration, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Preincubation, antibody incubations, and washes were conducted in 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8), 150 mm sodium chloride, and 0.05% Tween 20 with 5% skim milk. A chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used to detect the immunological reaction. The two oligonucleotides O1 (CAG CGG ATC CCC AAT AGT GAA CAT ATG AAT ACT) and O2 (CGC TGG ATC CAC TAA TCA TTT TCT TTA TAA TTA TTA G) were used to amplify a sequence encoding 100 amino acids of PfPP2C. The fragment was then cloned into the BamHI site of pGEX-3X. After induction with 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, the GST-100 fusion protein was purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads, used to immunize rabbits in phosphate-buffered saline and Freund's complete adjuvant, and then boosted every 4 weeks using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Blood was collected 10 days after the fourth boost. The serum was used at 1:10,000 dilution for immunoblots. Hydrolyzed and partially dephosphorylated bovine milk casein (Sigma) was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) and the catalytic subunit of bovine heart protein kinase as recommended by the supplier. Radiolabeled casein was precipitated and washed twice with 20% trichloroacetic acid, washed once with acetone, dried, and suspended in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to 105 cpm/μl. The phosphatase assay was performed as described by McGowan and Cohen (19McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 194: 795-823Google Scholar) using 10 μg of purified enzyme. Protein extracts were prepared from 12 ml of P. falciparum asynchronous culture (2% hematocrit, 10% parasitemia) and resuspended in 1 ml of sterile phosphate-buffered saline. After filtration, 200 μl was run on Superose 12 HR 10/30 at 0.2 ml/min, and fractions of 500 μl were collected. 20 μl of each fraction was tested by Western blotting using anti-PfPP2C antibodies or by phosphatase activity assay in the presence of 10 mmMg2+ and 5 μm okadaic acid. Using a cDNA library made from asexual stages of the red blood cell parasite P. falciparum, we isolated a full-length cDNA clone encoding a protein with homology to PP2C enzymes. The 3.7-kilobase pair cDNA (GenBank™ accession number AF023665) has an open reading frame (PfPP2C) starting at position 391. The first ATG codon has a standard nucleotide sequence for translation initiation. PfPP2C is predicted to encode a protein of 920 amino acids with a molecular mass of 103 kDa, which is twice the size of other PP2C proteins. Homology searches conducted for the PfPP2C protein sequence revealed a significant similarity to PP2C proteins from different organisms. Computer alignments revealed that certain PP2C sequences in the data base matched best with the N-terminal part of PfPP2C (Pf2C-1), whereas others matched best the C terminus of PfPP2C (Pf2C-2). Fig. 1 shows the alignment of both Pf2C-1 and Pf2C-2 with PP2C proteins from different organisms. Conserved motifs needed for phosphatase function in other organisms (20Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) are conserved in thePlasmodium sequence, but otherwise, homology is remote. The two halves share distant homology, suggesting that PfPP2C may have resulted from the fusion of two ancestral phosphatases during evolution. To examine PfPP2C expression in P. falciparum, we generated polyclonal antibodies against an internal 100-amino acid portion of PfPP2C fused to GST. On a Western blot of parasite cell extract (Fig. 2), the immune serum (second through fourth lanes), but not the preimmune serum (first lane), recognized a ∼103-kDa protein in all intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite. To test whether the full-length protein has a cation-dependent phosphatase activity, PfPP2C was fused to the C-terminal region of GST, and the fusion protein was purified and tested for phosphatase activity (Fig. 3 A). Recombinant PfPP2C is active in the dephosphorylation of casein and is highly activated in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+. The activity was minimally inhibited by 5 μm okadaic acid, a compound effective in the blockage of type 1 and 2A phosphatases. Because PfPP2C is twice the size of normal PP2C proteins, and each half has homology to other PP2C proteins, we were interested in knowing if both halves can function independently. To test this, the first half alone (Pf2C-1), the second half alone (Pf2C-2), and a hybrid form with the N-terminal part of the first half and the C-terminal part of the second half (Pf2C-Δ) were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli (Fig. 3 B). The purified proteins were then assayed for phosphatase activity. The results in Fig. 3 C show that each construct had phosphatase activity that was stimulated by Mg2+ or Mn2+, suggesting that both halves and the hybrid form possess PP2C activities. The activity obtained with each half alone (Pf2C-1 or Pf2C-2) was substantially lower than that obtained with full-length PfPP2C (Fig. 3 A), suggesting that the presence of both phosphatases in the same molecule is necessary for optimal activity. The fact that PfPP2C is composed of two fused phosphatases raised the question of whether these two units interact with each other. We used the two-hybrid system in S. cerevisiae, expressing Pf2C-1 downstream of the Gal4 DNA activation domain (pACTII-Pf2C-1) and Pf2C-2 or the hybrid form downstream of the Gal4-binding domain (pAS-CYH2-Pf2C-2 or pAS-CYH2-Pf2C-Δ, respectively) (21Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4853) Google Scholar). The plasmids obtained were used to transform the yeast strain Y190, and the Leu+,Trp+ transformants carrying both plasmids were tested for β-galactosidase expression using the X-gal filter lift assay (22Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 9: 2117-2130Google Scholar, 23Harper J.W. Adami G.R. Wei N. Keyomarsi K. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar). In transformants expressing each vector alone (data not shown) or coexpressing pACTII-Pf2C-1 and pAS-CYH2-Pf2C-Δ (Fig. 4), no β-galactosidase expression was detected. In contrast, the transformants carrying pACTII-Pf2C-1 and pAS-CYH2-Pf2C-2 became blue in the presence of X-gal, indicating that the β-galactosidase gene was being transcribed and translated. This suggests that the two halves (Pf2C-1 and Pf2C-2) interact with each other. Results from the two-hybrid system experiments suggest two hypotheses about the interaction between the two units (Pf2C-1 and Pf2C-2) in vivo. First, there could be an intramolecular association. Alternatively, PfPP2C may form dimers in which the Pf2C-1 of one polypeptide can interact with the Pf2C-2 of another. In an attempt to distinguish between these two possibilities, proteins from P. falciparumextracts were separated on a Superose 12 gel filtration column, and the fractions collected were then tested for phosphatase activity in the presence of Mg2+ and okadaic acid. The results in Fig. 5 show a single peak of activity at an approximate molecular mass of 240 ± 30 kDa, indicative of a dimer structure of PfPP2C. To confirm that the phosphatase activity of this peak corresponds to PfPP2C activity, all fractions (fractions 1–47) collected by gel filtration were tested by Western blotting using the anti-PfPP2C antibodies. The results in Fig. 5 show complete agreement between the Western blot and the phosphatase activity peaks, suggesting that the unique Mg2+-dependent phosphatase activity detected in this fraction corresponds to PfPP2C. We have further explored subunit and domain interactions by mixing purified components and assessing activity (Fig. 6). PfPP2C has higher specific activity than either half alone. When the two halves are mixed together, there is no stimulation of activity (data not shown). When PfPP2C is mixed with Pf2C-1 or Pf2C-2, the activity decreases 5–6-fold from the level of PfPP2C alone, approaching the activity of the isolated halves. To test whether PfPP2C is a functional homologue of yeast PP2C, we tested the effect of PfPP2C expression in a PTC1-deleted strain ofS. pombe. The PTC1 gene encodes a PP2C that is proposed to play an important role in the yeast osmolarity response. The deletion strain has a greatly reduced ability to survive exposure to elevated temperature; the cells die more quickly after shifting from 25 to 48 °C than do wild-type cells (24Shiozaki K. Akhavan-Niaki H. McGowman C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3742-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We made a construct in which PfPP2C is expressed under the control of the S. cerevisiae GAL1 or ADH promoter or under the control of theS. pombe nmt promoter. Both S. cerevisiaepromoters are constitutive in S. pombe. The plasmids obtained were then used to transform the KS834 strain deleted for thePTC1 gene. The transformants were first tested by Western blotting and showed expression of PfPP2C (data not shown). They were then tested for growth at 37 °C and for their ability to survive after shifting from 25 to 48 °C with or without pretreatment at 37 °C. Similar results were obtained with all three promoters; data are shown only for the GAL1 promoter construct. The growth rate of the ΔPTC1 strain expressing PfPP2C at 37 °C was faster than that of the ΔPTC1 strain carrying the vector alone, and its ability to form colonies after shifting directly from 25 to 48 °C was similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. 7). This suggests that the malaria PP2C is able to play the same role as its homologue PTC1 in the stress response. Pf2C-1, Pf2C-2, and Pf2C-Δ constructs were also active in the yeast system. Each was able to partially correct the heat response defect of the ΔPTC1 strain (Fig. 7). These results correlate with the in vitro activity data, indicating that PfPP2C is composed of two active phosphatases fused together and that their fusion is necessary for optimal activity within the cell. We have isolated a new PP2C gene from P. falciparumcalled PfPP2C. In yeast, PP2C has been implicated in the response to extracellular stimuli such as osmolarity changes or heat shock. Such stresses are signaled through the MAPK cascade, consisting of Wik1, a MAPK kinase kinase that phosphorylates Wis1, a MAPK kinase, which in turn phosphorylates Spc1, a MAPK. Data inS. cerevisiae and S. pombe indicate that tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine phosphatases negatively regulate the stress-activated kinase cascades (6Shiozaki K. Russel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Millar J.B.A. Buck V. Wilkinson M.G. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2117-2130Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 26Maeda T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2870-2877Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In both yeasts, genetic and biochemical studies are in agreement concerning the direct involvement of tyrosine-specific phosphatases in dephosphorylation of MAPK (Spc1 in S. pombe and Hog1p in S. cerevisiae). Genetic data also suggest that serine/threonine phosphatases negatively regulate the stress-activated MAPK cascades. 1) In S. cerevisiae, two PP2C genes (PTC1 andPTC3) were isolated as multicopy suppressors of mutations that caused hyperactivation of the Hog1p kinase cascade (6Shiozaki K. Russel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). 2) Mutations in the HOG1 gene suppress the synthetic lethality interaction involving ptp2 and ptc1 mutations (28Maeda T. Tsai A.Y. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5408-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). 3) In S. pombe, mutations in Spc1 (MAPK) or Wis1 (MAPK kinase) suppress the calcium hypersensitivity of mutants carrying deletions of two or three serine/threonine phosphatase genes (26Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar). Biochemical data from Gaits et al. (7Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), however, indicate that in S. pombe, PTC1 does not negatively regulate Wis1 or Spc1. These authors suggest that PTC1 may act downstream of Spc1 kinase in the stress-activated signal transduction pathway by dephosphorylating an Atf1 cofactor involved in transcriptional induction (7Gaits F. Shiozaki K. Russell P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17873-17879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown by heterologous complementation that PfPP2C can play the same role as PTC1 in S. pombe and perhaps functions similarly in P. falciparum. We have also shown that PfPP2C is composed of two protein phosphatases (Pf2C-1 and Pf2C-2) fused together in the same polypeptide. Both Pf2C-1 and Pf2C-2 are active in vitro and are able to complement the heat shock stress response defect of a PTC1 deletion in S. pombe. Most organisms have at least two PP2C genes. Often, different phosphatase 2C proteins are involved in the same signal transduction pathway. For example, in both S. cerevisiae and S. pombe, three genes encoding PP2C-like proteins are involved in the regulation of the MAPK cascade (6Shiozaki K. Russel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 26Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 28Maeda T.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3634-3645Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Other genes have been isolated during the S. cerevisiae genome sequencing project encoding proteins that show homology to PP2C sequences, but as of yet have no function or activity assigned. In A. thaliana, both ABI1 and ABI2 are PP2C-like proteins involved in an abscisic acid-dependent stress response pathway (12Leung J. Bouvier-Durand M. Morris P.-C. Guerrier D. Cheldorf F. Giraudat J. Science. 1994; 264: 1448-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 13Meyer K. Leube M.P. Grill E. Science. 1994; 264: 1452-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar, 30Leung J. Merlot S. Giraudat J. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 759-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, we have evidence for only a single PP2C gene. Low stringency Southern and Northern blot analyses detect a single gene and transcript (data not shown), whereas gel filtration analysis reveals only a single activity peak eluting at a position expected of a molecule four times the size of a standard PP2C (Fig. 6). Our data are consistent with the notion that PfPP2C is a double phosphatase, wherein both halves possess a phosphatase fold. Purified PfPP2C, Pf2C-1, Pf2C-2, and a hybrid form composed of the first half of Pf2C-1 and the second half of Pf2C-2 are each active in dephosphorylating casein in vitro. A complete dimer appears to be necessary for maximal activity since the two halves alone or in combination possess considerably lower activity than the whole molecule, and either half interferes with the ability of the whole to achieve maximal activity upon mixing. Taken together, these results suggest the model presented in Fig. 8, in which PfPP2C acts as dimer, and the Pf2C-1 of one polypeptide interacts with the Pf2C-2 of the second polypeptide. The whole dimer is, in effect, a tetrameric phosphatase. Perhaps the unusual structure of PfPP2C can overcome the need in other organisms for additional genes, offering a novel way to regulate the signal transduction pathway. Study of the expression and activity of PfPP2C during stress conditions and analysis of its crystal structure could better our understanding of the mechanisms that monitor the stress response of the malaria parasite. Its unusual configuration is different enough from PP2C proteins of human cells to be considered a good target for new antimalarial drugs.

https://openalex.org/W2035019329,"Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) is a potent mitogen. It acts through activation of specific cell surface receptors leading to intracellular tyrosine phosphorylation cascades, but several reports also indicate that aFGF enters cells and that it has an intracellular function as well.

In vivoit is thought to be involved in mesoderm induction, angiogenesis, and in several other processes (1Burgess W.H. Maciag T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 575-606Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that aFGF as well as basic FGF (bFGF or FGF-2) do not fit into the paradigm that protein growth factors act only through cell surface receptors inducing phosphorylation cascades and other second messengers. Thus, there are several indications that after binding to FGF receptors, aFGF and bFGF enter the nucleus, and that this is required for the mitogenic response, at least in certain cells.

Evidence that exogenous aFGF as such is able to enter the cytosol was obtained by fusing a signal for farnesylation, a CAAX-tag, onto the C terminus of aFGF. When aFGF-CAAX was incubated with cells expressing FGF receptors, farnesylated growth factor was obtained (5Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Klingenberg O. Munoz R. Olsnes S. J. Biol.

Since the enzymes catalyzing farnesylation are only found in the cytosol and possibly in the nucleus, this indicates that aFGF-CAAX had traversed cellular membranes. Harper and Lobb (6Harper J.W. Lobb R.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) found that reductive methylation of aFGF reduced its affinity both for heparin and surface FGF receptors as well as its mitogenic activity. They found that Lys-132 (using numbering 1–154 for full-length aFGF, in their paper denoted Lys-118 due to different numbering) was the primary site of modification. Burgess et al. (7Burgess W.H.

The mutant and wild-type aFGF-stimulated protein tyrosine phosphorylation and induction of proto-oncogenes to the same extent, and aFGF(K132E) was equally efficient as wild-type aFGF in induction of mesoderm formation in Xenopus (8Burgess W.H.

In the present paper we have studied whether the lack of mitogenicity of aFGF(K132E) is due to impaired entry into cells. First, we have investigated whether exogenous aFGF(K132E) enters the nuclear fraction in a similar manner as wild-type aFGF. We have also introduced the mutant artificially into the cytosol as a fusion protein with DT-A and studied the ability of this fusion protein to stimulate DNA synthesis and proliferation in cells with and without functional FGF receptors. Finally, we have studied phosphorylation of aFGF and aFGF(K132E)in vitro and in vivo.

The plasmids paFGF(K132E) and pHBGF-DT1 (10Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) were cut with EcoRI or NcoI, respectively, digested with mung bean nuclease and cut with NdeI. Fragments from paFGF(K132E) and vector from pHBGF-DT1 were ligated, creating a plasmid containing the sequence encoding aFGF(K132E) in front of DTA. pBD-23 encodes the B-fragment of DT (11Stenmark H. Afanasiev B.N. Ariansen S. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pTrc-aFGF(K132E) and pTrc-aFGF(K132E)CAAX were obtained by cloning the cDNA for the mutant growth factor with and without the terminal CAAX motif between the NcoI site and the SalI orPstI sites, respectively, in pTrc99a (Pharmacia). Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (12Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) except that for aFGF(K132E) and aFGF(K132E)-CAAX the clarified bacterial lysates were applied to heparin-Sepharose in a buffer containing 0.1 m NaCl instead of 0.5 mand were further purified using an Econo-Pac Q cartridge (Bio-Rad). Cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (DMEM) with 7.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum in a 5% CO2atmosphere at 37 °C. SDS-PAGE was carried out with 7.5 or 15% gels as described by Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and processed as described (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The plasmids were linearized, transcribed in vitro, and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system in the presence of unlabeled methionine or [35S]methionine as described (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). After translation, when appropriate, lysates containing fusion protein were mixed with an equal volume of lysate containing unlabeled DT-B. The lysates were dialyzed against dialysis buffer (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.0, 140 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2) to remove free [35S]methionine and reducing agent, allowing disulfide bridges to be formed (11Stenmark H. Afanasiev B.N. Ariansen S. Olsnes S. Biochem. J. 1992; 281: 619-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). After lysis in lysis buffer (0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) cells were centrifuged for 15 min at 720 × g. The supernatant was centrifuged again for 5 min at 15,800 × g and the second supernatant was designated the cytosol/membrane fraction. The pellet was washed twice by resuspension in lysis buffer containing 0.3 m sucrose that was layered on lysis buffer containing 0.8 m sucrose and centrifuged at 720 × g for 15 min at 4 °C then sonicated and centrifuged for 5 min at 15,800 × g. The supernatant of this centrifugation was designated the nuclear fraction (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2–4 × 105 cells/well. After 24 h the cells were serum starved for 1–3 days in DMEM containing 2.5 μg/ml insulin and 2.5 μg/ml transferrin, then incubated in the same medium containing 5 μg/ml lovastatin, 5–20 units/ml heparin, 3–5 μCi/ml [3H]mevalonic acid, and 1 μCi/ml [14C]mevalonic acid together with 10–100 ng/ml of the recombinant proteins for 18 h. Subsequently, the cells were washed twice in HEPES medium containing 20 units/ml heparin and twice in HEPES medium without heparin (5Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Klingenberg O. Munoz R. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30680-30685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The cells were lysed, fractionated, and both the nuclear and the cytosol/membrane fractions were incubated with heparin-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, pH 7.2) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To measure [3H]thymidine incorporation, cells growing in 24-well microtiter plates were kept for 1–3 days in serum-free medium; in the case of NIH 3T3 cells, 2.5 μg/ml insulin and 2.5 μg/ml transferrin were present. Then medium with or without heparin and different concentrations of either purified recombinant proteins or dialyzed translation mixtures was added. Incubation was continued for 48 h when the fusion proteins of diphtheria toxin were used, and for 24 h when aFGF (or its mutant) as such was used. During the last 6 h of incubation, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was present. Finally, the incorporated radioactivity was measured (3Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T. Science. 1990; 249: 1567-1570Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). To measure cell proliferation, incubation with fusion proteins was continued for 96 h, cells were trypsinized, and cell number counted in a cell counter. To measure bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation, NIH 3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips and rendered quiescent by incubation in serum-free medium in the presence of 5 μg/ml insulin and 5 μg/ml transferrin for 72 h. The cells were incubated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml aFGF or aFGF(K132E). During the last 6 h of this period, 100 μm BrdUrd (Amersham) was present. After labeling, the cells were fixed, immunostained with a monoclonal mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Amersham) and a biotinylated horse anti-mouse antibody, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-streptavidin and then analyzed by fluorescence microscopy as described (14Wennstrom S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells growing in 6-well plates were incubated for 2 h on ice with dialyzed translation mixtures with fusion protein with or without DT-B in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled methionine, unlabeled aFGF, and in the absence or presence of 10 units/ml heparin, and then washed five times. To measure binding, cells were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To measure translocation, cells were treated with medium, pH 4.5, for 5 min at 37 °C, washed and treated for 10 min at 37 °C with 3 mg/ml Pronase in the presence of 10 μmmonensin (15Moskaug J.O. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2518-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed again, lysed, and centrifuged for 2 min at 15,800 × g. The supernatant was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. When appropriate, after Pronase treatment the cells were washed and further incubated at 37 °C for 24 or 48 h in DMEM. Then the cells were fractionated and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S.

Chem. 1988; 263: 2518-2525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 2–24 h in medium containing [35S]methionine-labeled growth factor in the presence of 0.1–1 mm unlabeled methionine, washed and, when appropriate, incubated further for 24 h (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The cells were then treated with 3 mg/ml Pronase at 37 °C for 5 min, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added. Cells were washed once in HEPES medium with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, lysed, and subjected to fractionation and heparin-Sepharose precipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Dialyzed unlabeled translation mixtures were added to U2OS cells growing as monolayers in 24-well plates in DMEM with 7.5% fetal calf serum in the presence or absence of heparin. The cells were incubated overnight and the rate of protein synthesis was measured by incorporation of [3H]leucine into trichloroacetic acid precipitable material for 30 min (10Wiedlocha A. Madshus I.H. Mach H. Middaugh C.R. Olsnes S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4835-4842Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 16Sandvig K. Olsnes S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7495-7503Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NIH 3T3 cells were serum-starved for 3 days in the presence of 2.5 μg/ml insulin and 2.5 μg/ml transferrin, then treated for 8 min with purified, recombinant aFGF or aFGF(K132E). The cells were then washed and lysed in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), centrifuged for 5 min at 15,800 × g at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged again, and incubated with a rabbit anti-FGF receptor 1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA). Immunecomplexes were collected with protein A-Sepharose, subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was probed with a mouse anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and visualized with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. NIH 3T3 cells were seeded out in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks at a density of 1 × 106 cells/flask in DMEM containing 10% fetal calf serum. On the following day the medium was changed to DMEM without fetal calf serum and the cells were grown for 48 h. The cells were subsequently incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in HEPES medium with additions as indicated, and total RNA was isolated from the cells by the LiCl/urea/SDS method (17Birnboim H.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 1487-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Samples of 5 μg of total RNA were separated on 1% agarose-formaldehyde gels (18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and blotted onto Hybond-N membranes (Amersham, United Kingdom), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The membranes were baked at 80 °C for 2 h and UV cross-linked. The blots were hybridized (19Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7264) Google Scholar) with a v-fos probe (1.0-kilobase PstI fragment) (20Curran T. Peters G. Van Beveren C. Teich N.M. Verma I.M. J. Virol. 1982; 44: 674-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with 32P by the random primer technique (21Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16646) Google Scholar). Kodak (Rochester, NY) X-Omat AR films were exposed to the filters at −80 °C in the presence of intensifying screens. Cells were lysed in Tris lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 20 mm NaCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm Na3VO4, 0.5% Triton X-100), diluted 5 times in kinase buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm ATP, 40 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP), and then incubated at 37 °C for 1 h with 0.1 mg/ml (final concentration) aFGF-CAAX or aFGF(K132E)-CAAX. The reaction mixtures were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Serum-starved U2OSDR1-R4 cells were preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h in phosphate-free DMEM containing 100 μCi/ml32PO43−. aFGF or aFGF(K132E) (50 ng/ml) and heparin (5 units/ml) was added and incubation was continued for 12 h. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline with heparin and once without heparin and lysed in the presence of phosphatase and protease inhibitors. The postnuclear supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-aFGF antibody (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. cDNA encoding aFGF (9Jaye M. Howk R. Burgess W. Ricca G.A. Chiu I.M. Ravera M.W. O'Brien S.J. Modi W.S. Maciag T. Drohan W.N. Science. 1986; 233: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) was mutated at codon 132 by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis creating a glutamic acid codon instead of lysine. This mutation has been described to strongly reduce the mitogenic activity of the growth factor (7Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). cDNA for wild-type and mutant growth factor were transcribed in a cell-free system and translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. To check that the mutated aFGF had retained its ability to bind to FGF receptors, we added the labeled growth factor to different cell lines and kept them on ice for 2 h, then the cells were washed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of heparin, wild-type growth factor bound extensively to untransfected U2OSDR1 cells as well as to the same cells transfected with FGF receptor 4 (U2OSDR1-R4) (12Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and to NIH 3T3 cells expressing FGF receptor 1 (22Bellot F. Crumley G. Kaplow J.M. Schlessinger J. Jaye M. Dionne C.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2849-2854Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1, 4, and 7), while aFGF(K132E) bound to a lesser extent under the same conditions (lanes 10 and16). In the presence of heparin, there was no binding in U2OSDR1 cells lacking FGF receptors (lanes 5 and14), whereas NIH 3T3 cells and U2OSDR1-R4 cells bound wild-type and mutant aFGF to a similar extent (lanes 2, 8, 11, and 17). This binding could be competed out with excess unlabeled aFGF (lanes 3, 9, 12, and 18). The observation that aFGF(K132E) was bound to a similar extent in the presence and absence of heparin, while wild-type growth factor bound considerably more extensively when heparin was absent indicates that, under the conditions used, aFGF(K132E) does not bind well to surface heparans in accordance with earlier observations (7Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). To compare in more detail the affinities of wild-type and mutant aFGF for the FGF receptor, we performed a binding competition experiment. The results (Fig. 1 B) showed that the ability of wild-type and mutant aFGF to compete out the binding of 125I-labeled wild-type growth factor was essentially the same. Burgess et al. (7Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) demonstrated that both mutant and wild-type aFGF stimulate protein tyrosine phosphorylation and phospholipase C-γ phosphorylation, and that both induce immediate early gene mRNA expression. By immunoprecipitation with anti-FGF receptor 1 antibodies and Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine we found that both the mutant and the wild-type growth factor induced tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF receptor 1 in serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 2 A). Approximately the same concentration of the two proteins were required to obtain tyrosine phosphorylation of FGF receptor 1 (data not shown). In the same cells we also detected induction of c-fos mRNA in response to both mutant and wild-type aFGF (Fig. 2 B). It was previously reported that aFGF(K132E) has strongly reduced mitogenic activity as compared with wild-type aFGF (7Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Ravera M. Jaye M. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2129-2138Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We confirmed this in NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 3 A), U2OSDR1-R4 cells (Fig. 3 B), and calf pulmonary artery endothelial cells (Fig. 3 C) assayed by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and in NIH 3T3 cells also measured by BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 3 D). In untransfected U2OSDR1 cells there was no mitogenic activity of aFGF in accordance with earlier findings (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Cell. 1994; 76: 1039-1051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Altogether, the data confirm and extend previous findings that although aFGF(K132E) binds to and activates FGF receptors equally well as wild-type aFGF, it is a poor inducer of DNA synthesis. There are several reports that externally added aFGF is translocated to the nuclear fraction in cells containing FGF receptors (4Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Madshus I.H. Sandvig K. Olsnes S.

This transport appears to be required for stimulation of DNA synthesis, at least in certain cells (3Imamura T. Engleka K. Zhan X. Tokita Y. Forough R. Roeder D. Jackson A. Maier J.A. Hla T. Maciag T.

Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). After transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with the growth factor, the distribution between the nuclear and the cytosolic fractions was similar for the aFGF(K132E) and wild-type aFGF (25Burgess W.H. Shaheen A.M. Hampton B. Donohue P.J. Winkles J.A. J. Cell Biochem. 1991; 45: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the possibility existed that exogenously added mutant growth factor might not be transported to the nuclear fraction. To investigate this, we incubated in vitro translated, [35S]methionine-labeled growth factor with serum-starved NIH 3T3 cells at 37 °C for 24 h. The cells were washed and in some cases incubated further for 24 h. Finally, the cells were treated with Pronase, washed, lysed, and fractionated into a nuclear and a cytosol/membrane fraction which were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. There was no appreciable difference between the wild-type and the mutant growth factor in their capability of being transported to the nuclear fraction within 24 h, and in both cases the growth factor could still be detected in the nuclear fraction after an additional incubation for 24 h in several experiments (Fig. 4 A). It should be noted, however, that in some experiments the growth factor (both wild-type and mutant) was not stable in the nuclear fraction after the additional 24-h incubation (data not shown). The reason for this variation between experiments is not known. In U2OSDR1 cells lacking FGF receptors no translocation of growth factor to the nuclear fraction was seen (data not shown) in accordance with earlier data (12Wiedlocha A. Falnes P.Ø. Rapak A. Munoz R. Klingenberg O. Olsnes S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When bacterially expressed growth factor with a farnesylation signal (a CAAX motif) at the C terminus (aFGF-CAAX) is added to cells in the presence of lovastatin and radiolabeled mevalonate, part of the growth factor is labeled indicating that it is exposed to the cytosol (5Wiedlocha A.

The cell-killing activity of Bax appears to function in biological systems ranging from eukaryotic unicellular organisms to mammalian cells.We found that an Escherichia coli cell transformed with a prokaryote expression vector carrying mammalian bax orbak cDNAs grew poorly in solid and liquid media. To biochemically investigate the function(s) of Bax in detail, we have chosen this organism as a Bax-expressing host, because there is no report that E. coli has endogenous bcl-2-related genes for interaction with Bax. Here, we present that a trace expression of Bax kills E. coli cells and that this process includes many physiological changes with regard to monounsaturated fatty acid composition, dioxygen consumption, generation of reactive oxygen species, and nicked DNA.DISCUSSIONWe reported here that a trace amount of the human Bax protein halted the growth and then caused the death of E. coli cells accompanied by some physiological changes, including increases in monounsaturated fatty acids, O2 consumption, superoxide radicals, nicked DNA, and the frequency of mutations. Bax easily mutated the host and plasmid DNA to give colonies of normal size. Therefore, so far, it might be difficult to find these phenomena.It was shown that the Bax protein is lethal in S. cerevisiaeand S. pombe (13Sato T. Hanada M. Bodrug S. Irie S. Iwama N. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Golemis E. Fong L. Wang H.G. Reed J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9238-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 16Greenhalf W. Stephan C. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 169-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 18Jürgensmeier J.M. Krajewski S. Armstrong R.C. Wilson G.M. Oltersdorf T. Fritz L.C. Reed J.C. Ottilie S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 325-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). However, the amount of Bax expressed was not described. In the case of E. coli, a trace amount (0.01% of total protein) was sufficient to kill the host. Two criteria were applied to distinguish death from growth arrest: a viable bacteria-specific fluorescence dye system and a decrease of colony formation ability (Fig. 1). These results indicated that E. coli cells carrying pHis-bax are easily killed, and the process does not involve cell lysis. This death appears to be specifically caused by the mammalian pro-apoptotic factors, because Bcl-xL did not affect E. coli growth, unlike Bax and Bak. Bcl-xL had a modest inhibitory effect on Bax inE. coli. When Bcl-xL was expressed in excess of Bax, Bcl-xL effectively abolished the Bax cytotoxicity (Fig. 2). On the other hand, Bcl-xL antagonized the cytotoxicity to the less extent, when bcl-x was tandemly located downstream of bax (Figs. 1 and 3). In the latter, the expression of Bcl-xL was nearly the same as that of Bax and the trace amount (data not shown). Most of the Bax protein molecules in the cell could avoid association with Bcl-xL. Again, it was underscored that Bcl-xL inhibited the Bax cytotoxicity through an interaction with BH3 of Bax (Fig. 2) as shown in mammalian cells (25Simonian P.L. Grillot D.A.M. Merino R. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22764-22772Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently identified the region of Bax lethal to E. coli and found that the region is responsible for inducing apoptosis (22Ishibashi Y. Nishimaki K. Asoh S. Nanbu-Wakao R. Yamada T. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).During culture in L-broth, a trace of Bax protein was detected at 2 h before cessation of growth and the amount increased gradually with vigorous shaking (Fig. 3). At the point at which cell growth stopped, the amount of Bax expressed in a single cell corresponded to no more than 0.01% of total E. coli protein. It is well known that the depletion of glucose in medium elevates cAMP levels in cells to make a complex with a cAMP receptor protein. In turn, this complex can activate lac promoter. It is likely that depletion of glucose contained in yeast extract results in the expression of a trace amount of Bax protein.Bax expression enhanced O2 consumption of E. coli cells by 60% for 45 min just before it completely stopped the growth (Fig. 6). Since KCN inhibited the O2consumption, a respiratory chain was activated (data not shown). It is not likely that the Bax protein directly binds to oxygen to consume oxygen, because computer analysis showed that Bax does not share any motif with proteins which bind to dioxygene. It is unknown how Bax activates the respiratory chain. Enhanced generation of superoxide by Bax expression can be also explained by activation of the respiratory chain. Otherwise, a redox imbalance due to Fe2+ or NADPH depletion in cells may take place in response to Bax expression (36Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12958-12963Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,37Privalle C.T. Kong S.E. Fridovich I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2310-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).Generation of superoxide results in high levels of ROS, including hydrogen peroxide and hydroxy radical, which are known to cause damage to DNA, proteins, and membranes. Enhanced conversion of superoxide to other ROS probably accounts for the increase of nicked DNA caused by Bax expression, although we could not detect any substantially damaged products such as 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and peroxidized lipid and any radicals by electron spin resonance spectrometry (data not shown).It is very interesting that in cells expressing Bax, the composition of monounsaturated fatty acids increased 6-fold (Fig. 5). Some bacteria such as E. coli and Pseudomonas synthesize monounsaturated fatty acids via an anaerobic pathway, whereas in others, such as Bacillus and Corynebacterium, and in animals, synthesis is via an aerobic pathway (38Stanier R.Y. Adelberg E.A. Ingraham J.L. The Microbial World. 4th Ed. Prentice-Hall, Inc., Englewood Cliffs, NJ1976: 219-220Google Scholar). In the aerobic pathway, desaturase(s) uses oxygen molecules in a monooxygenase-type reaction. Bax expression may activate the enzymes involved in the synthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids in the anaerobic pathway. It is well known that the higher the content of unsaturated fatty acids, the more flexible the cell membrane. The cells expressing Bax were expected to be more sensitive to osmotic pressure. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the cells expressing Bax enlarged along both axes (Fig. 4).Recently the x-ray structures of renatured (39Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P.

The three-dimensional fold of Bcl-x is similar to that of the bacterial toxins diphtheria toxin and colicin A (27Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 39Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S.

Like these bacterial toxins, Bcl-xL was also shown to form an ion channel in synthetic lipid membrane with selectivity for K+ and Na+ (40Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). These proteins appear to insert and be internalized into a membrane by a very similar multistep mechanism. Bax may insert into a membrane more easily than Bcl-xL, because Bax has a high sequence homology with Bcl-xL, and its expected hydrophobic cleft, formed by BH1, BH2 and BH3, is bigger than that of Bcl-xL (27Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In addition, Bax structure lacks two hydrogen bonds stabilizing the central helices, suggesting that Bax possesses a greater potential for membrane insertion than either Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL (27Aritomi M. Kunishima N. Inohara N. Ishibashi Y. Ohta S. Morikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27886-27892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). As expected, Bax has recently been shown to form an ion channel at neutral pH in synthetic lipid membrane, whose activity was inhibited by Bcl-2 (41Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A.M. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.-J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar). The results of DCF-DA should be interpreted with caution. One plausible explanation is as follows: Bax formed an ion channel and enhanced the transport of specific cations (not proton) or anions, which diminished the membrane potential as a result. To compensate the membrane potential, the respiratory chain may be activated to enhance the proton pumping activity, leading the inside of the cell to become alkaline. The activated respiration may lead to oxygen radical formation.Bcl-2 inhibits the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (42Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzei E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Science. 1997; 275: 1129-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (4383) Google Scholar) and the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (44Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Decaudin D. Macho A. Hirsch T.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). It can be explained as that Bax associates with Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL to abolish their activities, resulting in cell death. It has been proposed that Bcl-2 functions as an inhibitor of the anti-oxidant pathway. This is also explained as that Bax generates superoxide and that Bcl-2 antagonizes Bax. In fact, Xiang et al. (20Xiang J. Chao D.T. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14559-14563Crossref PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar) reported that inducible expression of Bax causes apoptosis without the need for stimulus and increases ROS. Recently, we have isolated an E. coli mutant that suppresses cell death even on expression of Bax, in which the RNase E gene is split into 5′- and 3′-regions. The truncated RNase E also made cells resistant to paraquat, a generator of superoxide. 2R. Nanbu-Wakao, S. Asoh, K. Nishimaki, Y. Ishibashi, R. Tanaka, and S. Ohta, submitted for publication. Therefore, it is likely that Bax induces the oxygen radical in E. coli. We show the region lethal to bacteria is common to a region inducing apoptosis in mammalian cells (22Ishibashi Y. Nishimaki K. Asoh S. Nanbu-Wakao R. Yamada T. Ohta S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The findings described in this study offer a useful approach using E. coli for investigating the molecular mechanism of apoptosis. Apoptosis in multicellular organisms is an active cellular self-destruction that is directed by genes. It is not only a physiologically important process in tissue homeostasis and developmental elimination but also a final defense against viral infection and the emergence of cancer (1Ellis R.E.

Bcl-2 protects cells from apoptosis induced by a wide variety of stimuli, including radiation, growth factor deprivation, free radicals, alterations in Ca2+, viral infection, chemotherapeutic drugs, and axotomy (6Yang E. Korsmeyer J.S. Blood. 1996; 88: 386-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its related proteins, the Bcl-2 family, regulate apoptosis by interacting one with each other (7Williams G.T. Smith C.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 777-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Members of the Bcl-2 family are functionally classified into two groups (8Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S.

In contrast, the second group, including Bax, Bak, Bad, Bik, Bcl-xβ, and Bcl-xS, promotes apoptosis. Bax is a 21-kDa membrane protein with a membrane anchor sequence at the C terminus and promotes apoptosis (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J.

IlvY positively regulates the expression of the ilvC gene in an inducer-dependent manner and negatively regulates the transcription of its own divergently transcribed structural gene in an inducer-independent manner. Although binding of IlvY protein to the tandem operators is sufficient to repress ilvYpromoter-specific transcription, it is not sufficient to activate transcription from the ilvC promoter. Activation ofilvC promoter-specific transcription requires the additional binding of a small molecule inducer to the IlvY protein-DNA complex. The binding of inducer to IlvY protein does not affect the affinity of IlvY protein for the tandem operator sites. It does, however, cause a conformational change of the IlvY protein-DNA complex, which is correlated with the partial relief of an IlvY protein-induced bend of the DNA helix in the ilvC promoter region. This structural change in the IlvY protein-DNA complex results in a 100-fold increase in the affinity of RNA polymerase binding at theilvC promoter site. The ability of a protein to regulate gene expression by ligand-responsive modulation of a protein-DNA structure is an emerging theme in gene regulation.

The ability of a protein to regulate gene expression by ligand-responsive modulation of a protein-DNA structure is an emerging theme in gene regulation. LysR-type proteins are the most common class of transcriptional regulatory proteins in prokaryotes (1Schell M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Regulation by LysR-type proteins is distinguished by several highly conserved unique properties. LysR-type proteins typically activate transcription of a target gene(s) and autoregulate their own synthesis from a single regulatory locus. In most cases, the target gene is divergently transcribed from the structural gene encoding the LysR-type protein. Activation of the target gene requires the binding of a metabolically important small molecule inducer, whereas autoregulation of the LysR gene is inducer-independent. Inducer binding, however, does not significantly alter the DNA binding affinity of these proteins (1Schell M.A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 597-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Thus, unlike other well characterized inducer-responsive activator proteins, LysR-type proteins are unusual in that the binding of inducer activates transcription by affecting an activator property of the protein distinct from its DNA binding activity. However, the molecular basis of this regulation has not been determined for any member of this important class of transcriptional regulatory proteins. IlvY protein is a prototypic member of the LysR family of transcriptional regulatory proteins and is required for the regulation of ilvC gene expression in Escherichia coli(2Henikoff S. Haughn G.W.

C.1987: 352-367Google Scholar). The ilvC gene encodes acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase (EC 1.1.1.86), an enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the branched chain amino acids, l-isoleucine,l-valine, and l-leucine (5Umbarger H.E. Neidhart F.C. Ingraham J.L. Brooks-Low K. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1987: 352-367Google Scholar). Together with IlvY protein, either substrate of this enzyme, α-acetolactate or α-acetohydroxybutyrate, induces the activation of ilvCgene expression. Like other LysR-type proteins, IlvY protein also represses transcription of its own divergently transcribed structural gene in an inducer-independent manner (3Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2441-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Watson M.D. Wild J. Umbarger H.E. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 1014-1020Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the first molecular mechanism for inducer-mediated activation by a LysR-type protein. Specifically, we show that IlvY protein binds cooperatively to the tandem operator sites in the divergent-overlapping promoter region of the ilvYCoperon (Fig. 1) in an inducer-independent manner and autoregulates its own gene expression by an RNA polymerase occlusion mechanism. We further show that the binding of IlvY protein to the tandem operators is necessary but not sufficient to activate transcription from the ilvC promoter. Activation of transcription from the divergent ilvC promoter requires the additional binding of an inducer molecule to an IlvY protein-operator DNA complex. Inducer binding effects the partial relief of an IlvY protein-induced DNA bend centered around the −35 hexanucleotide element of the ilvC promoter. This ligand-induced structural change in the DNA helix enhances the binding affinity of RNA polymerase at the ilvC promoter. Thus, IlvY protein activates transcription from the ilvC promoter by the binding of an inducer molecule that directs a conformational change in the structure of an IlvY protein-operator DNA complex and enhances the recruitment of RNA polymerase to the ilvC promoter without affecting the occupancy of IlvY protein at the tandem operator sites.

E. coli RNA polymerase, pancreatic RNasin, and DNase I were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Shrimp alkaline phosphatase was purchased from United States Biochemicals. Radiolabeled nucleotides were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Operon Technologies. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the oligonucleotide directed in vitromutagenesis kit version 2.0 from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. DNA sequencing was performed using the SequenaseTM kit from United States Biochemicals. Plasmid DNA isolation and all recombinant DNA manipulations were carried out using standard methods (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmid pET3cY, used for the overexpression of the ilvY gene product, was created by site-directed mutagenesis of theilvY gene, contained on a 1400-bpBamHI-PvuII DNA fragment (derived from plasmid pRW1Y) (3Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2441-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An NdeI restriction site was created at the beginning of the ilvY protein coding sequence. This site replaced the natural GTG translation initiation codon with the more common ATG codon. The 1225-bp NdeI-BamHI restriction fragment from the resulting plasmid, containing theilvY gene, was ligated into the compatibleNdeI-BamHI sites of the Studier vector pET3c (8Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) to yield the plasmid pET3cY. Plasmid pRWSR-2, used to generate the DNA fragments (containing ilvYC sequence from bp position −111 to +1 cloned into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pUC19) described in the binding and chemical footprinting experiments, has been previously described (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Plasmid pBENDY, used to create the isometric O1O2-containing DNA fragments for circular permutation assays, was created by ligating an end-filled 132-bp EcoRI-HindIII DNA fragment containing the tandem O1O2 operator sites into the uniqueSalI restriction site of plasmid pBEND2 (9Kim J. Zweib C. Wu C. Adhya C. Gene. 1989; 85: 5-23Crossref Scopus (321) Google Scholar) Plasmid pDD3Y, used for the in vitro transcription reactions, was constructed by ligating an end-filled 220-bpBglII-EcoRI DNA restriction fragment (containingilvYC sequence from bp −220 to +1 relative to the transcription start site of ilvC) into the BamHI site (end-filled) of the plasmid pDD3 (10Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2763-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The BamHI site in pDD3 is flanked on both sides by tandemrrnBT1T2 transcriptional terminator sequences (10Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 2763-2777Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A 4-liter culture of strain BL21DE3 (8Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4834) Google Scholar) containing plasmid pET3cY was grown to anA 600 = 0.8 at 20 °C, induced with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.75 mm, and allowed to continue growing for an additional 6–8 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 40 ml of an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mmNaCl, 5% glycerol, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol (Buffer A). Cells were disrupted by sonication in a Rosett cell using a Tekmar Sonic Disruptor set at 100 W. Sonication of cells was performed on ice with 12 × 20 s bursts interrupted by 2-min cooling intervals. To avoid partial proteolysis owing to the high arginine/lysine ratio of the IlvY protein (11Viale A.M. Kobayashi H. Azakawa T. Henikoff S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5224-5229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to the cell suspension at a final concentration of 1 mm immediately before and after sonication. All subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C or on ice. The crude cell lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor for 40 min at 4 °C. The resulting supernatant solution was transferred to an Erlenmeyer flask, and a 10% (v/v) solution of polyethyleneimine was slowly added dropwise to a final concentration of 0.6% (v/v) with gentle stirring and incubated for an additional 20 min. This mixture was centrifuged for 30 min at 10,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The resulting precipitate was resuspended in 10 ml of Buffer A containing 0.3 m NaCl and gently stirred for 15 min. This suspension was centrifuged for 20 min at 12,000 rpm in a Beckman JA20 rotor. The resulting supernatant solution was slowly loaded onto a 4 ml phosphocellulose column pre-equilibrated in Buffer A. After loading the sample, the column was washed with one column volume of Buffer A. IlvY protein was eluted from the column with an 80-ml linear KCl gradient (0.1–0.5 m) in Buffer A. Typically, the protein eluted at a [KCl] = 0.4 m. 1-ml fractions were collected and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 2 μl of each fraction were assayed in a 20-μl reaction volume using the mobility shift binding protocol described below. Appropriate fractions were pooled and concentrated in an Amicon Microcon-10 ultrafiltration device. Protein concentrations were measured according to the method of Bradford (12Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216440) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit. A final yield of about 0.5 mg of greater than 95% purified IlvY protein is routinely obtained from 1 liter of cells. The specific DNA binding activity of the purified IlvY protein was estimated from a titration of its binding to a molar excess of DNA fragments containing the tandem operator sites. The concentration of O1O2-containing DNA fragments used yielded an operator site concentration of 4.4 × 10−8m, which was titrated with substoichiometric concentrations of IlvY protein dimer between 1.9 × 10−9m and 1.5 × 10−8m. Bound and free DNA were separated by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. The fraction of bound complex was proportional to the IlvY dimer concentration over the entire concentration range. As expected, this result was consistent with stoichiometric formation of a protein-DNA complex since the operator site concentration exceeds the effective binding dissociation constant for the operator sites (2.2 × 10−9m; see below) by 20-fold. The fraction of active IlvY protein dimer estimated from the slope of the plot of operator sites bound per IlvY protein dimer was never less than 50%. The percent activity was used to calculate active dimer concentrations in subsequent experiments. The quarternary structure of the IlvY protein was determined by gel filtration chromatography. A 0.05-ml sample containing 0.2 mg of purified IlvY protein in Buffer A was applied to a 0.6 × 30-cm column of Sephacryl S200HR equilibrated in Buffer A. The IlvY protein was eluted from the column in Buffer A at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/hr. 110-μl fractions were collected and assayed for protein content and for DNA binding activity using the mobility shift binding protocol described below. The elution profiles of a mixture of molecular weight standards (100 mg of alcohol dehydrogenase, 150 kDa; 100 mg of hexokinase, 102 kDa; 100 mg of ovalbumin, 46 kDa) were determined in a separate experiment. The molecular weight of an IlvY monomer based on its deduced amino acid sequence is 33 kDa. The DNA binding activity of the IlvY protein eluted from the column at the position of a globular protein with a molecular weight of 65–70 kDa. No evidence of lower or higher molecular weight species was apparent. Thus, at concentrations as high as 200 μg/ml (6 μm protein monomer), IlvY protein exists in solution as a homodimer. Mobility shift binding assays were performed according to the methods of Fried and Crothers (13Fried M.G. Crothers D.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6505-6525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1686) Google Scholar) as described by Wek and Hatfield (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) with the exception that gels were run in 1× TAE buffer (40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.5), 2 mm EDTA·2H2O). Radiolabeled DNA used in these experiments was present at final concentrations not exceeding 2 × 10−11m to ensure that the free concentration of IlvY protein was equivalent to the total IlvY protein concentration. Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 2.5 μg of sonicated herring sperm DNA/ml. Free and bound DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography following the exposure of Kodak XAR-5 film to the dried gels overnight at 25 °C. The autoradiograms were digitized with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx digital scanner. Band intensities were measured using the public domain NIH IMAGE gel quantitation software. The intensity of each band was corrected for background differences and normalized to the total intensity of all bands in each lane. The equilibrium binding data were analyzed by nonlinear least squares estimations. The algorithm for this analysis (14Johnson M.L. Faunt L.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 210: 1-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) uses a variation of the Gauss-Newton procedure to determine the best fit model-dependent parameter values corresponding to a minimum in the variance of each data point (15Hildebrand F.B. Introduction to Numerical Analysis. McGraw-Hill Publishing Corp., New York1956Google Scholar). The confidence levels for the curve fits reported correspond to approximately one standard deviation (65% confidence). DNase I footprinting reactions were performed according to the methods of Galas and Schmitz (16Galas D.J. Schmitz A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3157-3170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1334) Google Scholar) as described by Wek and Hatfield (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) using uniquely 5′-32P-end-labeled DNA fragments containingilvYC DNA from bp positions −111 to +1, derived from plasmid pRWSR-2. Binding reactions contained 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 mg of bovine serum albumin/ml, and 2.5 mg of sonicated herring sperm DNA/ml in a final volume of 40 μl. Operator DNA was present at a final concentration of less than 10−10m. Purified IlvY protein was present at a final protein dimer concentration of 5 × 10−8m. α-Acetohydroxybutyrate was present as specified in the figure legends. DNase I exposure was for 1 min at 25 °C. This yielded less than 30% nicked DNA fragments, determined by Cerenkov counting of the band corresponding to uncleaved DNA. This low nicking frequency is not expected to affect the intrinsic protein-DNA binding (17Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4% N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 m urea in TBE buffer (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography following the exposure of Kodak XAR-5 film to the gels at −70 °C in the presence of a Cronex Quanta III intensifying screen (DuPont). The autoradiograms were digitized with a Hewlett-Packard ScanJet IIcx digital scanner. The band intensity in each lane corresponding to the DNase I-hypersensitive site located at bp −37 in the ilvC promoter region was measured using the public domain NIH IMAGE gel quantitation software. The intensity of each band was corrected for background differences and normalized to the intensity of the unprotected band in the same lane at bp −90. Hydroxyl radical footprinting was performed as described by Tullius and Dombroski (18Tullius T.D. Dombroski B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5469-5473Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar) using the same DNA fragments (<1 × 10−10m) used in the DNase I footprinting reactions. Binding reactions were performed under equilibrium binding conditions as described above with the exception that glycerol was omitted from the reaction mixture. Samples were treated with hydroxyl radical for exactly 2 min at 25 °C and quenched with the addition of 20 μl of 0.2 m thiourea to ensure conditions of single-hit kinetics as described above. Reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (9.5% acrylamide, 0.5%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 m urea in TBE buffer (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography as described above. Data were analyzed by utilizing the public domain NIH IMAGE gel quantitation software. Regions of protection were determined by comparing the relative peak heights of each integrated band obtained from an integration of the bands of a digital image of each lane. In vitrotranscription reactions were conducted using the closed circular supercoiled (>80%) plasmid pDD3Y (described above), in the absence and presence of purified IlvY protein and/or inducer, according to the procedures of Hauser et al. (19Hauser C.A. Sharp J.A. Hatfield L.K. Hatfield G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 1765-1770Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RNA polymerase-plasmid DNA complexes were formed by preincubating 1 unit (2.4 pmol) of RNA polymerase and 100 ng of plasmid DNA (0.2 pmol) in a 20-μl reaction mixture (0.04 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 0.01 m MgCl2, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm CTP, 20 mm UTP, 10 mCi of [α-32P]UTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 40 units of RNasin for 10 min at 25 °C. Transcription reactions were initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 2 mm ATP, 2 mm GTP solution. Reactions were terminated after 4 min with the addition of 20 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.025% bromphenol blue, 0.025% xylene cyanol). Transcription under these conditions was determined to be linear with respect to time for at least 6 min and was proportional to the amount of plasmid DNA template used. To correct for differences in the total amount of transcription between reactions, the amount ofilv-specific transcription was determined by normalizing the relative signal of ilv-specific transcription to the relative signal of transcription arising from the RNA-I promoter present on each plasmid DNA template in the transcription reaction. Reaction products were separated by electrophoresis on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.6% acrylamide, 0.4%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) containing 8 m urea in TBE buffer (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar) and visualized by autoradiography as described above. Binding reactions were performed as described above using isometric DNA fragments containing the tandem O1O2 operators derived from the plasmid pBENDY. Products were resolved by electrophoresis through an 8% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (7.92% acrylamide, 0.079%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in 1× TAE (20Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982Google Scholar) buffer (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar). In reactions performed with inducer, 1 mm α-acetolactate was included both in the gel and in the running buffer. Analysis of bend mapping was performed as described by Wu and Crothers (21Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1984; 308: 509-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar). Estimates of bend angles were obtained as described by Thompson and Landy (22Thompson J.F. Landy A.

Abortive transcription initiation assays were performed in the presence or absence of 2 mm inducer (α-acetohydroxybutyrate) according to the methods of Hawley et al. (23Hawley D.K. Malan T.P. Mulligan T.P. McClure W.R. Chamberlin R. Promoters. Praeger Press, New York1982Google Scholar) as described by Parekh and Hatfield (24Parekh B.S. Hatfield G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, reactions were initiated by the addition of RNA polymerase at final concentrations of 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 nm to a preformed IlvY protein-DNA complex. IlvY protein-DNA complexes were preformed by incubating 30 nmIlvY protein dimer with 1 nm supercoiled DNA plasmid template, pDD3Y, for 20 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer A (0.04m Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 0.1 m KCl, 0.01m MgCl2, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin), 40 mmUTP, 100 mCi [α-32P]UTP, and 0.5 mm ApA. The inclusion of the dinucleotide ApA in the reaction mixture restricts transcription initiation to the ilvC promoter of the plasmid DNA template, pDD3Y, yielding the abortive product ApApUpU. Abortive transcription products were isolated by nondenaturing electrophoresis in a 25% polyacrylamide gel (23.75% acrylamide, 1.25%N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide) in 1× TBE buffer (7Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Colds Spring Harbor, New York1989Google Scholar), and quantitated by Phosphor-Imager analysis. τ is a measure of the lag time required for open complex formation observed in a productversus time plot. τobs values were determined by a nonlinear least-squares analysis of the kinetic data using the program LAGPLOT described by Goodrich (25Goodrich, J., Regulation of Transcription from the Escherichia coli Galactose OperonPh.D. Thesis, 1992, Carnegie Mellon University.Google Scholar). The apparent binding affinity of RNA polymerase (K B) and the first-order isomerization rate constant (k 2) were determined by plotting τobs as a function of 1/(RNA polymerase) on the basis of a least-squares fit to the equation τobs = (1/k 2) + (1/k 2 K B(RNA polymerase)) using the TAUPLOT program of Goodrich (25Goodrich, J., Regulation of Transcription from the Escherichia coli Galactose OperonPh.D. Thesis, 1992, Carnegie Mellon University.Google Scholar). Previous analyses with IlvY protein-enriched cell-free extracts indicated that IlvY protein binds to tandem operator sites (O1O2) in the divergent-overlapping ilvYC promoter region and that this binding is cooperative (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). To explore the quantitative nature of this cooperativity, binding titrations of purified IlvY protein to DNA fragments containing the tandem operators (O1O2) and to DNA fragments with either O1 or O2 deleted were performed (Fig. 2). These assays were conducted using concentrations of operator sites well below the effective binding dissociation constant for the tandem operator sites to evaluate the microscopic binding constants governing the assembly of IlvY protein-operator DNA complexes. The gel mobility shift of the tandem operator-containing DNA fragment showed only a single liganded complex, which we interpret to be O1O2 with both sites bound by IlvY protein dimer. The half-saturation point for IlvY binding to the DNA fragment containing O1 and O2corresponds to an effective affinity of 2.2 nm, consistent with a previous estimate (2 nm) obtained with IlvY protein enriched cell free extracts (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The lack of an intermediate band corresponding to IlvY protein bound to either O1 or O2 alone in the gel mobility shift experiment performed to generate the data in Fig. 2 is indicative of highly cooperative binding (17Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, the IlvY protein concentration required to half-saturate O1 alone is 8-fold greater than the concentration required to half-saturate the tandem operator sites (Fig. 2). We found previously that it was not possible to saturate the O2 site alone; at 8 × 10−8m IlvY dimer, the highest concentration used in the binding experiments, less than 15% of the DNA migrated as bound in gel shift assays (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Based on this measurement, the affinity of IlvY protein for the O2 site alone is calculated to be K 2 < 0.45 μm. When this experiment was repeated with the highly purified IlvY protein reported here, the same result was obtained. Therefore, the affinity for O2 alone is at least 200-fold weaker than for sites O1O2 together (6Wek R.C. Hatfield G.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 203: 643-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The observation that the apparent binding affinity for either operator site is reduced when the other site is removed indicates cooperative binding to the adjacent sites. To determine the affinity of IlvY protein for site O1 and to more precisely evaluate the cooperativity, the IlvY protein titrations of O1O2 and O1 alone (Fig. 2) were analyzed according to a general cooperative binding model (17Senear D.F. Brenowitz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13661-13671Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The adjustable parameters are the Gibbs free energy changes corresponding to the microscopic equilibrium constants for IlvY protein binding to O1 (ΔG 1 = −RT lnK 1) and to O2(ΔG 2 = −RT ln K 2), and for cooperativity (ΔG c = −RT lnK coop). When a complete titration of site O2 alone is absent, the analysis does not provide independent estimates of ΔG 2 and ΔG c. Instead, we found such a high numerical correlation that increasing values of one compensated for decreasing values of the other. This correlation did not affect ΔG 1 for which a precise estimate, ΔG 1 = −10.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol, was obtained. Thus, it was possible to define a lower limit to the coo"

PCI mRNA was also detected in both platelets and megakaryocytic cells using nested polymerase chain reaction. PCI was found to be located in the α-granules of resting platelets. Approximately 30% of the total amount of PCI in platelets was released after stimulation with ADP, collagen, adrenalin, thrombin, or thrombin receptor-activating peptide. Secreted PCI was detected on the surface of activated platelets and phospholipid microvesicles. PCI secreted from thrombin receptor-activating peptide-stimulated platelets inhibited activated protein C (APC) efficiently. PCI significantly inhibited APC in the presence of phospholipid vesicles prepared using rabbit brain cephalin (RBC) or a mixture of 40% phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), 20% phosphatidylserine (PS), and 40% phosphatidylcholine (PC) with a second order rate constant of 1.0 × 106m−1·min−1. Of these phospholipids, PE was critical for this inhibition. The dissociation constants of the binding of APC or PCI to solid phase phospholipids showed that APC binds more preferably to PE than to RBC or PS, and PCI to PE or RBC than to PS or PC. PCI binding to solid phase phospholipids depended on the presence of PE. RBC- or PE-bound PCI inhibited APC significantly but only weakly the γ-carboxyglutamic acid domainless APC. The γ-carboxyglutamic acid fragment of protein C suppressed the PCI-mediated inhibition of APC on solid phase RBC or PE. Most of the APC·PCI complex formed on solid phase RBC or PE was released into the soluble phase. These findings suggest that PCI secreted from activated platelets binds preferably to PE of platelet membrane and microvesicles and that it inhibits phospholipid-bound APC efficiently.

PCI is the main inhibitor of APC, but when its plasma concentration becomes limited in conditions associated with increased activation of protein C, α1-antitrypsin and α2-macroglobulin also form complexes with APC (8España F.

Chem. 1995; 270: 25336-25339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), giving further support to the important role that it plays in the regulation of the anticoagulant protein C pathway. Plasma PCI seems to be produced mainly in the liver because the plasma level of PCI decreased in patients with severe liver diseases (14Morito F. Saito H. Suzuki K. Hashimoto S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1985; 844: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Recently, PCI was detected in human seminal plasma, Graaf follicular fluid, testis, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicle (15Laurell M. Christensson A. Abrahamsson P.A. Stenflo J. Lilja H. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and the preacrosomal region of human spermatozoa (16Moore A. Penfold L.M. Johnson J.L. Latchman D.S. Moore H.D. Mol. Reprod.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5440-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of PCI in the reproductive organs has not been established. Platelets play a crucial role in hemostasis. Platelets contain several blood coagulation factors, such as von Willebrand factor (19Fressinaud E. Baruch D. Rothschild C. Baumgartner H.R. Meyer D. Blood. 1987; 70: 1214-1217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), fibrinogen (20Doolittle R.F. Takagi T.

Chem. 1978; 253: 8609-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Clotting factors derived from platelets promote blood coagulation and wound healing (26Colvin R.B. Gimbrone M.A. Vascular Endothelium in Hemostasis and Thrombosis. Churchill Livingstone, Edinburgh1986: 220-241Google Scholar). Platelets also provide a surface for binding factor Va and factor Xa, which leads to increased prothrombin activation (27Kane W.H. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3963-3969Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to their procoagulant activity, platelets may also modulate the activation of the coagulation and complement systems. Protein S secreted from platelets serves as a cofactor for APC-catalyzed inactivation of factor Va and factor VIIIa on the platelet surface (28Schwarz H.P. Heeb M.J. Lottenberg R. Roberts H. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1989; 74: 213-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombomodulin on the platelet surface may facilitate the thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C (29Suzuki K. Nishioka J. Hayashi T. Kosaka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1988; 104: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). C1 inhibitor, a member of the plasma serpin family secreted by platelets, may modulate the activation of the complement and intrinsic coagulation systems at inflammatory sites (30Schmaier A.H.

Sato, Department of Microbiology, Chiba University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan. This CMK cell line, which is derived from human megakaryocytic leukemia, contains proteins and granules typical of platelets (platelet peroxidase, membrane GPIb, GPIIb/IIIa, and α-granules) (43Adachi M. Ryo R. Sato T. Yamaguchi N. Exp. Hematol. 1991; 19: 923-927PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates of gel-filtered platelets or CMK cells were obtained by treating each cell pellet with Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), containing 0.5% Triton X-100, for 15 min at room temperature. The concentration of PCI antigen was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using peroxidase-coupled polyclonal anti-PCI IgG and tetramethylbenzidine as described previously (44Nakase T.

Reverse transcription of the total RNA (1 μg) from platelets, CMK cells, or HepG2 cells and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the cDNA were performed according to methods described previously (46Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Erlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13473) Google Scholar). The 5′-sense primer (20-mer) and the 3′-antisense primer (20-mer) used for PCI cDNA amplification correspond to nucleotides 76–95 (ATGCAGCTCTTCCTCCTCTT) and 281–300 (GACACTCGTAGAGGTACTCG) of a human PCI cDNA sequence, respectively; these primers produced a 225-base pair fragment (3Suzuki K. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Kurachi K. Akira M. Yamamoto S. Hashimoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 611-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AnSmaI-cleaved PCI cDNA was used as a PCR control (3Suzuki K. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Kurachi K. Akira M. Yamamoto S. Hashimoto S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 611-616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each cycle of PCR consisted of 2 min of denaturation at 94 °C, 1 min of annealing at 55 °C, and 3 min of polymerization at 72 °C. An aliquot of the PCR product was run on a 1% agarose gel, which was then stained with ethidium bromide. For cytometric analysis of activated platelets, 100 μl of gel-filtered platelets (2.5 × 108/ml) suspended in Hepes-buffered saline, containing 2 mm CaCl2 and 0.1% BSA, was incubated with TRAP (100 μm final concentration) without stirring at 37 °C for 30 min. Platelets were then washed with the same buffer and incubated with FITC-labeled anti-PCI IgG (5 μg/ml) or with FITC-labeled anti-GPIb IgG in the same buffer containing 0.02% NaN3 for 1 h in the dark. After washing, platelet-bound anti-PCI IgG was analyzed using FACScan (Becton Dickinson) with a fluorescence-1 channel. For analysis of intracellular PCI in resting platelets, gel-filtered platelets were treated with PermeaFix in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 0.02% NaN3 for 45 min in the dark. After washing, the platelets were incubated with 5 μg/ml FITC-labeled anti-PCI IgG for 1 h in the dark. After appropriate washing, platelet-bound anti-PCI IgG was determined as described above. Ultrathin sections of resting platelets or TRAP-stimulated platelets (fixed for 5 min after activation with 100 μm TRAP in Hepes-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2) were prepared as follows. Platelets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, at 4 °C for 3 h; after dehydrating, the blocks were embedded in L. R. White acrylic resin. The resin-embedded platelets were cut onto nickel 200-mesh grids. For labeling studies, the grids were incubated with 10 μg/ml anti-PCI IgG in 100 mm phosphate buffer overnight in a moist chamber and then conjugated with goat anti-mouse IgG to 15-nm colloidal gold for 1.5 h. After washing and drying the grids, they were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate. For controls, the sections were incubated with anti-GPIb IgG, anti-factor V IgG, or normal mouse IgG. APC (42 nm final concentration) was incubated with PCI (90 or 180 nm final concentration) in 50 μl of Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mm CaCl2 in the presence of phospholipid vesicles (125 μg/ml) prepared with RBC or with various concentrations of PE, PS, and PC or in the presence of heparin (5 units/ml). After 10 min of incubation, the amidolytic activity of the residual APC was determined by adding 2 ml of 100 μmBoc-Leu-Ser-Thr-Arg-MCA in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm CsCl and 2 mmCaCl2 to the reaction mixture. The release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin from the substrate by APC was determined using a fluorospectrophotometer (Shimadzu RF-510) with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 440 nm. Second order rate constants of the inhibition of APC by PCI were calculated according to the method of Cooperet al. (47Cooper S.T. Whinna H.C. Jackson T.P. Boyd J.M. Church F.C. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12991-12997Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) using the equation k′/[I] = (−lna)/t[I], where a is the residual protease activity in relation to an uninhibited control,t is the time, and [I] is the PCI concentration. Each reaction was performed twice in triplicate, and averages were calculated. Relative k′/[I] values were calculated by dividing the k′/[I] value in the presence of phospholipid vesicles by the value in the absence of phospholipids under the same assay conditions. Assays for binding APC, PCI, or APC·PCI complex to solid phase phospholipids were carried out based on methods described previously (48Nishioka J. Ido M. Hayashi T. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Microtiter plate wells were coated with RBC, PE, PS, or PC (200 μg/ml) or with a mixture of various PE:PC, PE:PS, or PS:PC ratios (0:100, 25:75, 50:50, 75:25 or 100:0) (200 μg/ml) in 100 μl of 100 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.3. After 2 h of incubation, the wells were blocked for 2 h with 5% BSA in 250 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl. After washing the wells with Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mmCaCl2, 100 μl of various concentrations of APC, PCI, or APC·PCI complex in the same buffer was added to the wells. After 2 h of incubation, the wells were washed, and well-bound APC, PCI, or APC·PCI complex was determined. Bound APC was determined using 300 μm S-2366 in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm CsCl and 2 mmCaCl2 after incubating at 37 °C for 45 min. The release of p-nitroaniline from the substrate by APC was determined at 405 nm using a microplate reader. For the determination of bound PCI, 100 μl of peroxidase-coupled anti-PCI IgG in Tris-buffered saline was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing the wells, 100 μl of freshly prepared tetramethylbenzidine (0.1 mg/ml) and 0.005% H2O2 in 100 mmsodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, was added to each well. The enzyme reaction was terminated after 15 min by adding 100 μl of 1m sulfuric acid, and absorbance at 450 nm was determined using a microplate reader. For measuring bound APC·PCI complex, 100 μl of peroxidase-coupled anti-protein C IgG (MFC-9), which binds equally to both free APC and APC·PCI complex (37Suzuki K. Matsuda Y. Kusumoto H. Nishioka J. Terada M. Yamashita T. Hashimoto H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing the wells, bound peroxidase-coupled anti-protein C IgG was determined as described above for bound PCI. The apparent dissociation constants (Kd values) of the binding of APC, PCI, or APC·PCI complex to solid phase phospholipids were determined by the double-reciprocal plot analysis as described previously (48Nishioka J. Ido M. Hayashi T. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 275-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Each binding assay was performed three times in duplicate, and the average was calculated. Microtiter plate wells were coated with RBC (200 μg/ml) or PE (80 μg/ml) in 100 μl of 100 mmNaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.3. After 2 h of incubation, the wells were blocked for 2 h with 5% BSA in 250 μl of 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mmNaCl. After washing with Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mm CaCl2, 100 μl of various concentrations of PCI in the same buffer was added to each well and incubated for 2 h. The wells were washed three times with the same buffer, and then 100 μl of APC or 0.8 nm Gla-domainless APC dissolved in the same buffer was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. Thereafter, the residual amidolytic activity of APC was determined by adding to the wells 50 μl of 600 μm S-2366 in 150 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 300 mm CsCl and 6 mm CaCl2 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. The release of p-nitroaniline from the substrate by APC was determined at 405 nm using a microplate reader. The effect of the Gla fragment of protein C on the inhibition of APC by PCI bound to solid phase RBC or PE was examined as follows. 100 μl of a mixture of 0.8 nm APC and various concentrations of Gla fragment was added to RBC- or PE-coated wells pretreated with PCI. After incubation for 30 min, the residual amidolytic activity of APC was determined as described above. RBC- or PE-coated microtiter plate wells were prepared as described above. Heparin-coated microtiter wells were prepared by incubating overnight 100 μl of 1 mg/ml heparin in 100 mm NaHCO3 buffer, pH 9.3, in the microtiter wells. The assay for complex formation of APC with PCI bound to solid phase phospholipids or heparin was performed as follows. 100 μl of 50 nm PCI in Hepes-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA and 2 mm CaCl2 was added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. After washing three times, 100 μl of various concentrations of APC in the same buffer was added to each well and incubated for 30 min. To determine the formation of APC·PCI complex in the supernatant of the wells, aliquots of the supernatant were transferred to other microtiter plate wells coated with anti-PCI IgG and incubated for 2 h. After washing the wells with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, APC·PCI complex was determined by ELISA using peroxidase-coupled anti-protein C IgG and tetramethylbenzidine as described above. To determine the amount of APC·PCI complex bound to solid phase RBC, PE, or heparin, 100 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100 was added to RBC-, PE-, or heparin-coated wells and incubated for 15 min with agitation. Then APC·PCI complex in solubilized samples was determined by ELISA as described above. PCI was detected in human platelets. The amount of PCI (mean ± S.D.) in gel-filtered platelets from healthy volunteers (n = 15, platelet counts: 23 ± 7 × 104 cells/μl blood) was approximately 2.9 ± 0.7 ng of PCI/1 × 109platelets. In a preliminary examination, the amount of PCI contained in platelets decreased after treating them with thrombin or collagen, suggesting that PCI is secreted from platelets during its activation. To confirm this, different numbers of platelets suspended in Hepes-buffered saline were stimulated with thrombin, and the platelets were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min. The amount of PCI in the supernatant of the incubation mixture containing resting platelets was scar"
https://openalex.org/W2000025217,"This article describes the first detailed analysis of mitochondrial electron transfer and oxidative phosphorylation in the pathogenic filamentous fungus,Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. While oxygen consumption was cyanide insensitive, inhibition occurred following treatment with complex III inhibitors and the alternative oxidase inhibitor, salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM). Similarly, maintenance of a Δψ across the mitochondrial inner membrane was unaffected by cyanide but sensitive to antimycin A and SHAM when succinate was added as the respiratory substrate. As a result, ATP synthesis through complex V was demonstrated to be sensitive to these two inhibitors but not to cyanide. Analysis of the cytochrome content of mitochondria indicated the presence of those cytochromes normally associated with electron transport in eukaryotic mitochondria together with a third, b-type heme, exhibiting a dithionite-reduced absorbance maxima at 560 nm and not associated with complex III. Antibodies raised to plant alternative oxidase detected the presence of both the monomeric and dimeric forms of this oxidase. Overall this study demonstrates that a novel respiratory chain utilizing the terminal oxidases, cytochrome c oxidase and alternative oxidase, are present and constitutively active in electron transfer inG. graminis tritici. These results are discussed in relation to current understanding of fungal electron transfer and to the possible contribution of alternative redox centers in ATP synthesis.

These results are discussed in relation to current understanding of fungal electron transfer and to the possible contribution of alternative redox centers in ATP synthesis. Under aerobic conditions, respiration of carbon metabolites in animal, plant, and fungal cells occurs in a tightly regulated manner to produce carbon dioxide and water. Transfer of the electron pairs associated with the respiration of carbon metabolites is indirect and complex, involving the reduction of the coenzymes NAD+ and FAD at two sites within glycolysis and four sites within the citric acid cycle. The electrons (associated with NADH and FADH2) are subsequently transferred, via at least four distinct sites, into the electron-transport chain, where a series of reduction and oxidation events occur in a sequential manner at approximately 10 different redox centers. In the classical scheme, these redox centers are composed of a series of cytochromes and iron-sulfur complexes. About half the energy generated is lost as heat. The remaining energy generated by the electron flow is utilized in the translocation of hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix to the inter mitochondrial membrane space. The free energy is thus stored in the proton gradient (proton motive force) and is subsequently used to drive the synthesis of ATP. While in mammalian systems the components and sequence of events associated with electron transport appear tightly conserved, those of plants and fungi appear more complex and diverse in nature, often involving alternative redox centers and pathways. Significant research has been conducted in the area of plant respiration, leading to the characterization of these alternative systems, but research into fungal respiration has been limited, and this is especially true for the pathogenic filamentous fungi. With the development and recent launch of a new antifungal chemistry (the methoxyacrylates) renewed interest is developing in this field (1Clough J.M. Nat. Prod. Reports. 1993; 10: 565-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 2Ziogas B.N. Baldwin B.C. Young J.E. Pestic. Sci. 1997; 50: 28-34Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Associated with the respiratory chain in most higher plants, some fungi and protozoa are the alternative oxidase, which is reduced by electrons from the ubiquinol pool (the only conserved element of all characterized respiratory chains). While biochemically consistent with a terminal oxidase, as it reduces O2 to water, this oxidase is distinguished by its insensitivity to cyanide, azide, and carbon monoxide. Plant alternative oxidase has been the focus of interest since it was first described (3Henry M.-F. Nyns E.-J. Subcell. Biochem. 1975; 4: 1-65PubMed Google Scholar) but real progress was hampered until Elthon et al. (4Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 84: 8399-8403Crossref Google Scholar) raised antibodies to the alternative oxidase of Sauromatum guttatum resulting in the eventual isolation of its cDNA clone (5Rhoads D.M. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2122-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Subsequent analyses of plant alternative oxidases have shown that the protein has a molecular mass of between 32 and 40 kDa and exists as a membrane bound protein dimer. Each monomer consists of two membrane spanning α-helicies with hydrophilic domains flanking the membrane anchoring helix which then extend into the matrix (6Moore A.L. Siedow J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1059: 121-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Monomers are separated by a sulfhydryl-disulfide system, which plays a key regulatory role in the activity of the oxidase, with increased activity associated with the reduced state (–SH-HS-). Regulation of the activity has also been linked with the induction of gene expression (7McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 781-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the redox state of the ubiquinol pool (8Ribas-Carbo M. Lennon A.M. Robinson S.A. Giles L. Berry J.A. Siedow J.N. Plant Physiol. 1997; 113: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), levels of α-keto acids (9Millar A.H. Hoefnagel M.H.N. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid cycle (10Vanlerberghe G.C. Day D.A. Wiskich J.T. Vanlerberghe A.E. McIntosh L. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 11Wagner A.M. van den Bergen C.W.M. Wincencjusz H. Plant Physiol. 1995; 108: 1035-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The alternative oxidase is of considerable interest in plants due to its nonphosphorylating nature. Although evidence in support of possible roles exist, a precise function remains unclear. Early reports by Bahr and Bonner (12Bahr J.T. Bonner Jr., W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3446-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that the alternative oxidase could be activated following the inhibition or saturation of the cytochrome pathway and, therefore, lead to the suggestion that the alternative oxidase in plants provided an “energy overflow” capability. Subsequent work has challenged this, on the basis that the alternative pathway may compete directly with the main pathway for electrons. A refined function has consequently been proposed whereby the alternative oxidase in plant mitochondria may provide a route for the maintenance of the high rate of electron transfer required under conditions of cold stress or during the operation of the photorespiratory cycle in photosynthesizing tissues. In fungi, and particularly in filamentous fungal species, the presence, function, and regulation of the alternative oxidase remains controversial. A recent report, based on whole cell sensitivity studies to the alternative oxidase inhibitor, salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM), 1The abbreviations used are: SHAM, salicylhydroxamic acid; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. 1The abbreviations used are: SHAM, salicylhydroxamic acid; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration. inferred that the alternative oxidase may be more extensively distributed among pathogenic fungal species than had previously been reported (13Hayashi K. Watanabe M. Tanaka T. Uesugi Y. J. Pestic. Sci. 1996; 21: 399-403Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), but remains to be conclusively demonstrated. Induction of the alternative pathway in filamentous fungi following inhibition of cytochrome b by methoxyacrylates and antimycin A, again defined by the development of pathogen sensitivity to SHAM, varies in extent dependent on which cytochrome b inhibitor was employed. This may be explained by the different target sites of the inhibitors within cytochrome b and the resultant electron “leakiness” observed in relation to electron flow through either the Q cycle (14Trumpower B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11409-11412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the alternative cycle hypothesis of Matsuno-Yagi and Hatefi (15Matsuno-Yagi A. Hatefi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16928-16933Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A common observation for all pathogenic fungi utilizing the alternative respiratory pathway was a fitness penalty, presumably due to the decreased ATP generating capacity of this pathway (2Ziogas B.N. Baldwin B.C. Young J.E. Pestic. Sci. 1997; 50: 28-34Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Induction and regulation of the plant alternative oxidase by compounds such as salicylic acid has been well documented. However, induction of the fungal alternative oxidase appears more limited, and has only been demonstrated to occur following inhibition of the respiratory chain (16Sakajo S. Minagawa N. Yoshimoto A. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 310-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and as a stimulatory response to the presence of nucleotides AMP, ADP, dAMP, and GMP (17Sakajo S. Minagawa N. Yoshimoto A. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1997; 61: 396-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the present study, we present evidence that in the phytopathogenic fungus, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, the cytochrome and alternative oxidase respiratory pathways are constitutively expressed and active. In contrast to the plant alternative respiratory pathway, the alternative oxidase of G. graminis tritici provides a mechanism for the generation and maintenance of a proton motive force (and hence ATP biosynthesis). Since its reliance on the alternative oxidase apparently carries no discernible fitness penalty, we anticipate that G. graminis tritici provides a model system for future studies to probe the function, regulation, and electron partitioning between cytochrome and alternative pathways in filamentous fungi. All chemicals, unless otherwise stated, were purchased from Sigma, Poole, UK, and were of the highest purity. Carboxin was supplied by Uniroyal Chemicals, Evesham, UK. Stock solutions of dinitrophenol (54 mm), antimycin A (19 mm based on an average formula weight 527.6 as purchased as a mixture of antimycin A1, A2, A3, and A4), oligomycin (13 mm, based on an average formula weight 790.4 as purchased as a mixture of oligomycins A, B, and C), and carboxin (0.01 m) were prepared in ethanol. Potassium cyanide was dissolved in dH2O (0.5 m) and SHAM (0.2 m) was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. All inhibitors were prepared immediately prior to use and the solvent concentration never exceeded 1% (v/v) in any assay. Rhodamine 123 and the luciferin:luciferase ATP determination kit were supplied by Molecular Probes, Inc., Europe. G. graminis tritici strains UK22A-1 and DK22A were isolated from the field in 1995 and strain T7 was a gift from Dr. Paul Bowyer, IACR-Long Ashton Research Station. The strain MT3 was isolated at Long Ashton. All cultures were maintained at 18 °C on Czapek Dox Agar (Oxoid) supplemented with d-biotin (0.2 ppm) and thiamine (0.2 ppm). Cultures for analysis were prepared routinely as described. Five, 5-mm agar plugs removed from the outer zone of 2-week-old cultures were inoculated onto 20 ml of Czapek Dox liquid medium (Oxoid) supplemented with d-biotin (0.2 ppm) and thiamine (0.2 ppm) and allowed to grow again. After 3 days at 18 °C, mycelia were disrupted with a hand-held, all glass, homogenizer (30 ml), and the resulting cellular suspension transferred to either 50 or 100 ml of Czapek Dox liquid medium in 100- or 200-ml conical flasks and maintained at 100 rpm, at 18 °C for 72 h. Sensitivity to respiratory and oxidative phosphorylation inhibitors was determined in 10 ml of liquid Czapek Dox medium maintained at 100 rpm at 18 °C, containing approximately 5 mg wet weight mycelia. Inhibition of growth was evaluated after 72 and 96 h, by dry cell weights. All assays were conducted in triplicate. Oxygen consumption by 10 mg ml−1 wet mycelia was measured at 18 °C with a Clark-type oxygen electrode in 2 ml of buffer I (50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4)). Inhibitors were added at the concentrations indicated with subsequent oxygen consumption recorded over 15 min unless otherwise indicated. The mitochondrial fraction was prepared as follows. Three-day-old mycelia were washed three times in 20 ml of citrate phosphate buffer containing 50 mm citrate, 50 mm disodium phosphate (pH 5.6), 1.2 m sorbitol, and 20 mm2-mercaptoethanol. Protoplasts were generated by cell wall digestion for 50–75 min with 3 mg/ml Novozyme 234 (Interspex Products, Inc., Foster City, CA) at 18 °C. Protoplast formation was monitored microscopically and once 90% of mycelia were protoplasted the Novozyme was removed by three washes with Buffer II (30 mm Tris-HCl, 15 mm sucrose, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmK2HPO4, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 0.2 mm Na2EDTA (pH 7.4)) at 2,000 ×g for 8 min at 0 °C. Protoplast disruption was performed at 0 °C in a Bead-Beater with 40 × g of acid-washed glass beads (150–212 μm diameter), 30 ml of protoplasts in buffer II, and 250 μl of fungal protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma P 8215). Glass beads and large cellular debris were removed by filtering the homogenate through Mira cloth (0 °C) and large cellular particulates were removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g, for 10 min at 4 °C. The mitochondrial fraction was obtained following centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resultant mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in Buffer III (1 ml: 0.1 mm KH2PO4, 0.1 mmK2HPO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mmEDTA, and 1 mm reduced glutathione). Ten μl of this suspension was removed for the determination of protein concentration and the remainder immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. All mitochondrial samples were stored at −80 °C. These preparations remained active for at least 6 months but were typically used within 1 month. Cytochrome difference spectra of G. graminis triticistrains were obtained from 100 μg of isolated mitochondrial protein using either a Unicam UV2 100 UV/VIS Spectrometer v4.15 or a spectrometer developed “in-house” by Prof. Peter Rich at the Glynn Laboratory, UCL (Gower Street, London, United Kingdom). Prior to analysis, mitochondria were washed in 2 ml of buffer III (pH 7.4) + 0.6m KCl to remove any pigment adsorbed to the mitochondrial membrane during preparation. Resolution of proteins by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was essentially as described by Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206615) Google Scholar) with equal amounts of mitochondrial protein fromArum maculatum and G. graminis tritici strain, T7 (approximately 20 μg) electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel. Electrophoresed proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell, 0.45 μm pore size) according to the method of Towbinet al. (19Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gorden J. Plant Physiol. 1993; 103: 845-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The transfer buffer contained 12.6 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.5), 192 mm glycine, and 10% methanol. The proteins were transferred at 100 V (constant voltage) for 1 h. Filters were initially incubated with 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 2% (w/v) milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline (145 mm NaCl (pH 7.2), 12.5 mm Na2HPO4, 2.5 mmNaH2PO4) in order to block unbound protein reactive sites. The filters were then washed in 0.6% (w/v) milk powder, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 buffer in phosphate-buffered saline. Transferred proteins were probed with the alternative oxidase antibody (4Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 84: 8399-8403Crossref Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1 in 1000 in 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and phosphate-buffered saline buffer. The filters were washed as described above, prior to incubation with a secondary anti-mouse antibody linked to horseradish-peroxidase enzyme and used at a concentration of 1 in 1000 as for the primary antibody. Filters were washed in blot rinse buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) and bound antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham International plc, Aylesbury, Bucks, United Kingdom). Isolated mitochondrial fraction (300 μg) was loaded with 1 μm potentiometric dye, rhodamine 123, in 1 ml of buffer II (pH 7.4) and maintained at 4 °C prior to analysis. The effect of the various inhibitors on rhodamine 123 fluorescence was monitored with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence with excitation filter BP546, dichroic mirror FT580, and barrier filter LP590. Cultures of G. graminis triticistrains in 100 ml of liquid Czapek Dox medium were maintained at 18 °C for the duration of the assays. At each time point, 15 ml of culture was removed, rapidly filtered through Mira cloth, and washed with 50 ml of deionized water. The mycelia were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen to prevent further ATP formation or hydrolysis and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. ATP was extracted from mycelia by grinding a known biomass under liquid nitrogen, in a pestle and mortar until a fine powder was obtained. The debris was resuspended in 500 μl of deionized water (2 °C) and immediately refrozen in liquid nitrogen. A 10-μl aliquot was removed for protein estimation. Isolation of ATP was achieved by vortex mixing the mycelial debris in phenol:chloroform (1:1) for 30 s and centrifuging in a precooled Biofuge 17RS centrifuge (at 4 °C) at 10,000 × g for 10 min to obtain a clear aqueous phase. The aqueous phase was removed and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. ATP levels remained constant over 7 days when stored under these conditions. The ATP concentration of the aqueous phases were determined by the quantity of light produced from a Luciferin-Luciferase assay in a Perkin-Elmer LS50B luminometer with a Total Emission Accessory fitted. Conversion of light intensity to ATP levels was by reference to a standard curve generated from known ATP concentrations which had been prepared following this protocol. Protein levels were measured using the BCA protein assay reagent system (Pierce) adapted for a 96-well microtiter plate assay. Absorbance values (560 nm) were converted to micrograms of protein ml−1 with reference to a bovine serum albumin standard curve. To determine the active involvement of the cytochrome and alternative respiratory pathways, in G. graminis tritici strains T7, UK22A-1, DK22A, and MT3, sensitivities to cyanide, antimycin A, carboxin, SHAM, and oligomycin B were determined. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required for 100% growth inhibition (MIC's) for each inhibitor were obtained and are presented in Table I.Table IMIC as measured by absence of growth for respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation inhibitorsInhibitorStrain MIC1-aMIC's were determined in triplicate with variation between determinants of <1%.T7DK22AUK22A-1MT3Antimycin A (μm)19101019Cyanide (mm)10101010Carboxin (μm)10101010SHAM (μm)200300300300Oligomycin B (μm)77771-a MIC's were determined in triplicate with variation between determinants of <1%. Open table in a new tab The MIC's for cyanide (an inhibitor of cytochromeaa 3) against each G. graminis triticistrain was 10 mm. Antimycin A, an inhibitor of electron flow from heme b 562 to the Qi site of complex III showed strong activity against all strains, with MIC values between 10 and 19 μm. Both the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor, carboxin, and SHAM, an inhibitor of the alternative oxidase, showed activity against all four strains. Similarly oligomycin B, an inhibitor of the F0 subunit of the F1F0-ATPase was also active against these strains. Overall, these effects are consistent with the presence inG. graminis tritici of both an active cytochrome and an alternative respiratory pathway, and with ATP generation being associated with the F1F0-ATPase. To establish that the inhibitor activities observed in the toxicity assays were indicative of inhibition of the components of the respiratory chain, oxygen consumption was measured in whole cells. It was also anticipated that the data would provide information as to the possible induction of the alternative respiratory pathway following inhibition of the primary cytochrome pathway. Inhibitor doses were selected with reference to previous studies with other fungi (2Ziogas B.N. Baldwin B.C. Young J.E. Pestic. Sci. 1997; 50: 28-34Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 13Hayashi K.

Treatment with 1 mm KCN resulted in no discernible reduction in the rate of O2 consumption over the assay period in any G. graminis tritici strain (TableII), indicating either a target site alteration or that KCN was prevented from gaining access to cytochromeaa 3. In contrast, treatment with 20 μm antimycin A reduced O2 consumption by between 36 and 48% compared with the control consumption rate in theG. graminis tritici strains. This apparently contradictory finding was reproducible in all G. graminis tritici strains as shown by the O2 consumption rate changes in Table II, and confirms the involvement of cytochrome b in the respiratory pathway of G. graminis tritici.Table IIOxygen consumption rates in whole cells at 18 °C of G. graminis tritici strains T7, DK22A, UK22A-1, and MT3InhibitorStrainT7DK22AUK22A-1MT3O2 consumption (μm O2/min/g wet cell)DecreaseO2 consumption (μmO2/min/g wet cell)DecreaseO2 consumption (μm O2/min/g wet cell)DecreaseO2consumption (μm O2/min/g wet cell)Decrease%%%%None0.3750.3000.4300.500KCN (1 mm)0.37500.30000.43000.5000SHAM (300 μm)0.188500.150500.310280.33034Oligomycin B (7 μm)0.173460.160480.270380.30040Carboxin (10 μm)0.30082-aInitial inhibitory effect of carboxin; oxygen consumption decreased by 62% in T7 and 48% in UK22A-1 after 30 min.0.30172-aInitial inhibitory effect of carboxin; oxygen consumption decreased by 62% in T7 and 48% in UK22A-1 after 30 min.Antimycin A (20 μm)0.180480.165450.275360.29042Antimycin A (20 μm) + SHAM (300 μm)0.0001000.0001000.0001000.0001002-a Initial inhibitory effect of carboxin; oxygen consumption decreased by 62% in T7 and 48% in UK22A-1 after 30 min. Open table in a new tab Similar to antimycin A, oligomycin reduced O2 consumption by between 38 and 48%, which is consistent with the effect that an inhibitor of ATP biosynthesis would exert on electron transfer over the assay period. Treatment of strains T7 and DK22A with the alternative oxidase inhibitor, SHAM, resulted in a reduction in O2consumption by 50%. Oxygen consumption was also reduced in strains UK22A-1 and MT3, although to a lesser extent (28 and 34%, respectively). The specificity of SHAM for the alternative oxidase at these doses implies that inhibition may be attributed to inhibition of the alternative oxidase itself. As cyanide-sensitive electron transfer was not detected in these assays, this provides strong evidence for the presence of an active alternative oxidase in G. graminis tritici. Complete inhibition of oxygen consumption was only recorded following inhibition by both antimycin A and SHAM. Treatment of whole cells with the complex II (succinate dehydrogenase) inhibitor, carboxin, at the MIC dose (0.01 mm) for G. graminis tritici resulted in a small decrease in O2consumption over the initial 2 min of the assay (7 and 8% in T7 and UK22A-1, respectively). This level of inhibition increased over a 30-min period to 62 and 48%, respectively. To determine whether the inhibitory effects of antimycin A and KCN resulted from inhibition of the cytochrome components of the respiratory chain, we sought evidence for the presence of their respective target cytochromes. Sodium dithionite reduced spectra were obtained by scanning intact mitochondria of T7, DK22A, UK22A-1, and MT3 from 400 to 650 nm at room temperature. A representative reducedversus oxidized difference spectrum is reproduced in Fig. 1 A. The pronounced absorbance peak, with maxima at 531 and 560–562 nm, corresponded to cytochromeb. The proportion of this attributed to theb-hemes of complex III was determined from the succinate reduced, antimycin A-treated absorbance spectra (Fig. 1 B). As the mitochondrial content of cytochrome b L(antimycin A sensitive) is equivalent to that of cytochromeb H, the proportion of the total cytochromeb reduced absorbance peak derived from the hemes of thebc 1 complex can be estimated as the sum of these two absorbances, and was therefore equivalent to 40%. The remainder of the absorbance was attributed to, an as yet uncharacterized,b-heme. Peaks corresponding to cytochromes c,c 1, and aa 3 with absorbance maxima at 550 nm (+521 nm), 554 nm (+523), and 603 nm, respectively, are as indicated. The immunoblot of the alternative oxidase protein in mitochondria isolated from T7 gave two distinct signals in the absence of a reductant (Fig. 2). These corresponded to the monomeric (oxidized form of approximately 37 kDa) and dimeric (reduced form of approximately 74 kDa) forms of the protein being present (4Elthon T.E. Nickels R.L. McIntosh L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 84: 8399-8403Crossref Google Scholar). Results from these experiments implicated the involvement of both cytochromes and alternative oxidase in mitochondrial respiration. To probe the specific activity of the two respiratory pathways further, and to analyze their respective contributions to both electron transport and ATP generation in G. graminis tritici, the maintenance of the membrane potential (Δψ) and ATP generation were monitored. The primary function of electron transport remains the generation and maintenance of a proton motive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane, which is then coupled to ATP synthesis at the F1F0-ATPase (complex V). In coupled mitochondria, the maintenance of Δψ may be used as a marker to evaluate the functional state of the respiratory chain. A procedure for monitoring this in G. graminis tritici was developed employing the potentiometric dye rhodamine 123. Penetration of whole cells and isolated mitochondria by rhodamine 123 is rapid and, similarly to previous studies, accumulation had no discernible detrimental effects on cellular or mitochondrial function over the assay period (21Shidoji Y. Nakamura N. Moriwaki H. Muto Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 58-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). As the intensity of fluorescence is related to Δψ, fluctuations in the proton motive force may be monitored. Fig. 3 depicts the fluorescence of rhodamine-loaded mitochondria of T7 in the presence and absence of inhibitory doses of antimycin A, KCN, SHAM, and oligomycin B. Inhibitory effects observed were consistent with the effects on whole cell O2 consumption. Treatment with antimycin A and SHAM resulted in a rapid loss of Δψ, as reflected by the loss of rhodamine fluorescence. No such loss was observed following treatment with either KCN or oligomycin B over a comparable time period. These results indicate that both an alternative oxidase and at least cytochrome b of the cytochrome pathway are active in the generation and maintenance of the proton gradient in G. graminis tritici and that inhibition of cytochrome oxidase imparts no discernible inhibitory effect on the maintenance of this ion gradient. Quantitation of ATP in whole cells following treatment of G. graminis tritici strain T7 with the inhibitors KCN, antimycin A, SHAM, oligomycin B, and SHAM + Antimycin A were examined over a 15-min time period (Fig. 4). Under these assay conditions, and in accordance with previous reports, ATP levels in non-inhibited cells were constant (Fig. 4). Under identical conditions the effects of inhibitors on cellular ATP concentration were evaluated. Oligomycin (7 μm) was included as a control to demonstrate the effect of the ATP synthase, rather than inhibition of electron transport. The results obtained also provide a standard for interpreting the inhibitory effects of the respiratory inhibitors. Treatment with 20 mm KCN resulted in a rapid reduction in cellular ATP over the initial 6 min of the assay. However, ATP levels then rose from 20% of the basal ATP level to 79% by 15 min, indicating the re-establishment of ATP generation. Antimycin A (20 μm) treatment resulted in a 74% reduction in ATP compared with the basal level. Unlike treatment with KCN, no reversal of this inhibitory effect on ATP concentration was observed during the time course. Inhibition of T7 with 0.2 mm SHAM resulted in a steady decrease in ATP levels over the time course to a final level equivalent to 42% of the basal ATP level, and similar to antimycin A inhibition, no reversal of ATP inhibition was observed during the time course of this experiment. The effect of combined treatment with both SHAM (0.2 mm) and antimycin A (20 μm) was the reduction in cellular ATP concentration by 77% after 15 min, which was comparable with the 80% reduction in ATP levels observed following oligomycin treatment of T7. The present study was conducted in order to evaluate the components of the electron transport chains in the filamentous fungus,G. graminis tritici, and their contributions to cellular respiration and ATP synthesis. Analysis of the biochemical effects of respiratory chain inhibitors, both in whole cells and in isolated mitochondria, describe several novel features associated with the regulation of fungal respiration and the contribution that the alternative pathway makes to mitochondrial ATP generation. Treatment with the cytochrome b inhibitor antimycin A suppressed whole cell oxygen consumption rates, promoted the rapid disruption of the Δψ (and hence proton motive force) associated with the inner mitochondrial membrane within 1.5 min following treatment, and significantly decreased cellular levels of ATP. However, cyanide treatment had no effect on oxygen consumption in whole cells or on the Δψ and only a brief transitory inhibitory effect on ATP generation was seen. This indicated that a second, cyanide-insensitive terminal oxidase was present in G. graminis tritici, which has a proton pumping capability associated with its capacity to reduce oxygen. Spectral analysis of the cytochrome content of G. graminis tritici indicated the presence of the standard cytochrome configuration, but that levels of cytochrome c, c 1, and aa 3 were significantly lower than that of cytochrome b, as predicted from the dithionite reduced minus oxidized spectra. The relative proportion ofb-heme (identified from this spectral trace) associated with the bc 1 complex was determined by analysis of the reduced minus oxidized spectra of antimycin A (Fig. 1 B) and myxothiazol (data not shown) treated mitochondria (reducing substrate was succinate). The level of b-heme associated with the bc 1 complex was estimated to be approximately 40% of the total b-heme in mitochondria and was, therefore, as expected, comparable to the levels ofaa 3 and c 1. Characterization of the non-bc 1 associatedb-heme, with an absorbance maximum at 560 nm, is the focus of further research. Inhibitor and spectral data confirmed the presence of an active cytochrome electron transport chain in G. graminis tritici, similar in composition and function to that of other eukaryotes. This electron transport chain contained complex I (mitochondria were sensitive to rotenone, data not shown) and able to utilize β-hydroxybutyrate as a reducing substrate. Complex II was also present as succinate was a utilizable reducing substrate in isolated mitochondria and toxicity assays with whole cells demonstrated sensitivity to carboxin. The presence of complexes III and IV were demonstrated spectrophotometrically with inhibitor studies (antimycin A, myxothiazol, and cyanide), and CO photolysis of CO boundaa 3 (data not shown). In contrast to earlier studies with filamentous fungi (13Hayashi K. Watanabe M. Tanaka T. Uesugi Y. J. Pestic. Sci. 1996; 21: 399-403Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar), our study shows that the alternative respiratory pathway of G. graminis tritici is constitutively expressed, as SHAM treatment resulted in a decrease in oxygen consumption in whole cells, without prior incubation with either cyanide or antimycin A. More significantly, the anti-Alt Ox antibody readily detected both the monomeric and dimeric forms of the alternative oxidase from protein prepared from T7 mitochondria, demonstrating the presence of both the active and inactive forms of this terminal oxidase. The function of the alternative oxidase has been the subject of considerable discussion in relation to a possible ATP generating system. In fungi, where the presence of the active form has been indicated, no functional roles have been ascribed. The present study has demonstrated that the alternative oxidase is required by actively growing G. graminis tritici for respiration and ATP formation, because it provides an essential function in the generation and maintenance of the Δψ associated with ATP synthesis. Indeed, the inhibitory effects of SHAM on mitochondrial function (O2 consumption, proton accumulation at the cytosolic side of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and ATP generation) were similar both in relation to the time of onset of the inhibitor effects following treatment and in the magnitude of their effects to those observed following antimycin A treatment. Maximal inhibitory rates of O2 consumption and ATP synthesis were only achieved following treatment with both compounds, indicating that both pathways are essential for ATP synthesis and cell growth. The alternative respiratory pathway of plants withdraws electrons from the ubiquinol pool and complete inhibition of O2 consumption only occurs following inhibition of both cytochrome and alternative pathways. In keeping with the nonphosphorylating nature of the plant alternative oxidase, ATP biosynthesis remains largely unaffected by SHAM, due to the presence of all the proton translocating sites within the cytochrome pathway. In G. graminis tritici, electron transport appears more complex with the site of electron partitioning between the two pathways less clear. ATP synthesis and O2 consumption were inhibited to a comparable level following treatment with either a cytochromebc 1 or an alternative oxidase inhibitor. Maximal rates of inhibition of these two processes were only obtained following treatment with both inhibitor classes, indicating the presence of two, inter-related pathways, each with a terminal oxidase and a proton translocatory function capable of generating a proton motive force of sufficient magnitude to drive ATP synthesis. The site of electron partitioning between these two pathways is not clear. Sensitivities to antimycin A and SHAM would support the site of electron partitioning being the same as for plants (namely at the ubiqinone pool), whereas the cyanide insensitivity and the ATP generating capacity of the SHAM-sensitive pathway would indicate that the partitioning event may occur downstream of cytochrome b, but prior to cytochromeaa 3. We propose, therefore, from our inhibitor studies on both O2 consumption and ATP synthesis that the alternative pathway of electron transport in G. graminis triticiinvolves two components. The first possesses the proton translocatory capacity associated with the SHAM sensitive alternative pathway and provides the proton motive force for ATP synthesis. Given the presence of a second, antimycin A and myxothiazol insensitive b-type heme, this cytochrome may form a redox center in the alternative system, and analogous to the b-type hemes of thebc 1 complex, may possess a proton translocatory ability. The terminal oxidase of the alternative respiratory pathway is the alternative oxidase and we therefore propose that respiration inG. graminis tritici may follow the scheme depicted in Fig. 5. The focus of our current research is to characterize the non-bc 1 associated b-type heme and to determine its function. We are also evaluating the effect(s) that such alternative respiratory pathways may have on the antifungal efficacy of inhibitors of the bc 1 complex such as the methoxyacrylates and related chemistries. We thank Prof. Peter R. Rich (University College, London) for advice and help in the analysis of the cytochromes of G. graminis tritici."
https://openalex.org/W2012847264,"Erythropoietin (Epo) is believed to transduce a signal by bringing two Epo receptors into close proximity, enabling cross-phosphorylation. We compared monomeric Epos with homodimers in which two Epo monomers are linked by polyglycine. Monomeric Epo mutant R103A is unable to support Epo-dependent cell growth or trigger Janus kinase 2 and STAT5 activation, even at concentrations greater than 7,000 times that sufficient for wild-type Epo activity. In contrast, R103A homodimer induces proliferation and transduces signal at concentrations similar to that of wild-type Epo monomer and homodimer. These experiments show that two discrete domains on Epo are required for receptor binding and activation. Our results also suggest that the EpoR can be dimerized by different forms and sizes of molecules, as long as <i>two</i>recognition motifs are provided in the same molecule. Design of other dimeric molecules may enhance our understanding of cytokine specificity and signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W2031849220,"The human ELL gene on chromosome 19 undergoes frequent translocation with the trithorax-likeMLL gene on chromosome 11 in acute myeloid leukemia. Recently, it was demonstrated that the product of the humanELL gene encodes an RNA polymerase II elongation factor (Shilatifard, A., Lane, W. S., Jackson, K. W., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1996) Science 271, 1873–1876). In addition to its elongation regulatory activity, ELL contains a novel type of RNA polymerase II interaction domain that is capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription in vitro (Shilatifard, A., Haque, D., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 22355–22363). Here, we report the identification and purification of a large ELL-containing complex that contains three proteins in addition to ELL and that we have named the Holo-ELL complex. The Holo-ELL complex can increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II. However, unlike the ELL polypeptide alone, the Holo-ELL complex is not capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription in vitro. The inability of the Holo-ELL complex to negatively regulate polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription suggests that one or more of the ELL-associated proteins regulate this activity, possibly through an interaction with the N-terminal domain of the ELL protein, which was shown to be required for the transcriptional inhibitory activity of ELL. Characterization of these ELL interacting proteins should help define the regulation of the biochemical activities of ELL and how loss of this regulation leads to the development of acute myeloid leukemia.

The human ELL gene was initially identified as a gene that undergoes frequent translocations with thetrithorax-like MLL gene in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (1Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H.

We demonstrated that ELL, a basic 621-amino acid protein, interacts directly with Pol II (3Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 27-31PubMed Google Scholar). ELL can also regulate the transcription by a novel Pol II interaction domain that is capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription initiation in vitro (3Shilatifard A.

Remarkably, the MLL-ELL translocation, which is found in patients with AML, results in the deletion of a portion of this functional domain (1Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H. Simon M.C. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12110-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Mitani K. Kanda Y. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Inazawa J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ELL mutants lacking the sequence that is deleted by the translocation are fully active in elongation and can interact with Pol II. However, such mutants fail to inhibit initiation by Pol II (3Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear how the transcription initiation inhibitory activity of ELL normally plays a role in the regulation of gene expression or the regulation of the cell cycle. However, further studies on the biochemical mechanism and physiological function of this functional domain of ELL and proteins that interact with this domain will improve our understanding of the role of this domain of the ELL protein in transcriptional regulation and in development of leukemia. The original purification of ELL took advantage of hydrophobic interactions and reverse-phase chromatography to purify a single polypeptide that was active as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor (4Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This purification employed denaturing solvents and conditions that destroy multiprotein complexes, and the proteins associated with ELL were not identified initially. However, alternate methods of purification procedures demonstrated that ELL exists as a multiprotein complex in vivo. As part of our effort to understand how elongation by RNA polymerase II is normally controlled and how it is dysregulated in certain malignancies, we set out to purify this ELL-containing complex. In this report, we describe the purification and characterization of a novel ELL-containing complex that we have named the Holo-ELL complex.

The purification of the holo-ELL was performed at 4 °C, and the fractions were not frozen unless indicated. The 0–40% (NH4)2SO4 fraction was dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent to that of 100 mm(NH4)2SO4 in buffer A (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF) and was then mixed with 1.0 liter of DEAE-cellulose equilibrated with buffer A containing 100 mm (NH4)2SO4.

Fraction VI was dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent to that of 50 mm KCl in buffer D. Fraction VI was then centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min and applied to a 50-ml TSK SP-5PW (Tosohaas) equilibrated in buffer B containing 50 mm KCl. Transcription elongation activity was eluted at 5 ml/min with a 500-ml linear gradient from 50 mm to 500 mm KCl. 10-ml fractions were collected, and the transcriptionally active fractions were pooled (fraction VII). Fraction VII was dialyzed to a conductivity equivalent to that of 70 mm KCl in buffer A, was centrifuged at 20,0000 × g for 30 min, and then was applied to a Mono-Q HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A containing 70 mm KCl. Transcription elongation activity was eluted at 1 ml/min with a 10-ml linear gradient from 70 to 500 mm KCl. 1-ml fractions were collected, and the transcriptionally active fractions were pooled (fraction VIII). The conductivity of fraction VIII was adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to that of 400 mm KCl in buffer C by dropwise addition of buffer C containing 1 m KCl. Fraction VIII was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to a Suprose-12 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer C containing 400 mm KCl. The column was eluted at 0.5 ml/min, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The transcriptionally active fractions were pooled and dialyzed against buffer A containing 50 mm KCl (fraction IX). Fraction IX was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to a Mini-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer A containing 50 mm KCl. Transcription elongation activity was eluted at 100 μl/min with a 1-ml linear gradient from 50 to 500 mm KCl. Fractions of 150 μl were collected, and the transcriptionally active fractions were pooled (fraction X). The conductivity of fraction X was adjusted to a conductivity equivalent to that of 400 mm KCl in buffer C by dropwise addition of buffer C containing 1 m KCl. Fraction X was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min and then applied to a Suprose 6 PC column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in buffer C containing 400 mm KCl. The column was eluted at 50 μl/min, and 50-μl fractions were collected. Small aliquots were made, and fractions were frozen at −80 C. Transcription elongation was assayed from both PGR220 S/P/X tailed template and AdML promoter as described before (4Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Since the discovery of ELL as an RNA polymerase II elongation factor (4Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we have obtained evidence that ELL exists in a stable complex with other cellular proteins. The recombinant ELL is transcriptionally active as a single subunit protein with a relative molecular mass of about 80 kDa on SDS-PAGE and ∼70 kDa on gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1 A). However, the analysis of crude rat liver extracts on gel filtration chromatography indicates that the transcription elongation activity was present in a large transcriptionally active multiprotein complex (molecular mass of 210 kDa) that contains ELL (Fig. 1 B). This was shown with monoclonal antibodies specific to the ELL protein. Comparative studies of the activation of transcription elongation with the partially purified ELL from rat liver nuclear extract and recombinant ELL demonstrated that both forms exhibited similar transcriptional elongation activity on linear templates. However, only the partially purified native ELL demonstrated transcription elongation activity from circular templates. This difference suggested that ELL-associated proteins might regulate the transcriptional activity of ELL. The purification of the Holo-ELL from total liver extract is summarized in Fig. 2 and TableI. The elongation stimulatory activity assay used to purify the Holo-ELL measured its ability to stimulate the rate of accumulation of 135-nucleotide transcripts synthesized by RNA polymerase II in the T-less cassette of the oligo(dC)-tailed template pCpGR220 S/P/X (Fig. 3 C) (4Shilatifard A.

A. 1991; 88: 4245-4249Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Analysis of fractions from size exclusion chromatography (step XI, Fig. 2) by SDS-PAGE revealed that the transcriptional elongation activity of the Holo-ELL copurified with four polypeptides of ∼20, 30, 45, and 80 kDa, which were named EAP20, EAP30, EAP45, and EAP80, respectively (Fig. 3 B). The solution molecular mass of this ELL-containing complex was estimated to be 210 kDa from the log of molecular mass of standard proteins versus their pattern of elution (Fig. 3 D).Table IPurification of the Holo-ELL complexFractionProtein1-aProtein was measured with the protein dye assay from Bio-Rad with bovine serum albumin as the standard.VolumeActivity1-bTranscription elongation assay was performed from PGR220 tailed template.

The EAP80 from the SDS-PAGE was further analyzed by both matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) and tryptic peptide sequencing (7Stone K.L. Williams K.R. Walker J.M. The Protein Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 427-434Google Scholar, 8Williams K.R. Samandar S.M. Stone K.L. Saylor M. Rush J. Walker J.M. The Protein Handbook. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1996: 541-555Google Scholar). The MALDI-MS analysis of EAP80 indicated that EAP80 is the ELL polypeptide with a 100% probability score (data not shown). The sequencing analysis of EAP80 tryptic peptide showed a sequence that exactly matched amino acids 394–406 of the ELL sequence (Fig. 4 A). Both the MALDI-MS and the sequencing of the tryptic peptide obtained from EAP80 demonstrated that EAP80 is the ELL polypeptide. Several findings here are consistent with the notion that ELL actually is in a complex with EAP20, EAP30, and EAP45: (i) the elongation activity copurifies with a complex containing 80-, 40-, 30-, and 20-kDa polypeptides both on ion exchange or size exclusion chromatography; (ii) a monoclonal antibody raised against ELL was able to co-immunoprecipitate all EAPs with ELL (EAP80) when the complex from step X was used. When the same experiment was performed with monoclonal antibodies raised against ELL2, which does not immunoprecipitated ELL, no EAP was co-immunoprecipitated (data not shown); and (iii) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated that Holo-ELL polypeptides (EAP80, EAP40, EAP30, and EAP20) are present in roughly equimolar amounts and account for more than 90% of the protein in the most highly purified Holo-ELL preparations (Fig. 3 B). First we examined the ability of the purified Holo-ELL complex to increase the catalytic rate of transcription elongation from promoter-independent oligo(dC)-tailed template in the absence of general transcription factors. In this experiment, RNA polymerase II was added to reaction mixtures that the contained oligo(dC)-tailed template pCpGR220 S/P/X. Transcription was initiated by the addition of three ribonucleoside triphosphates, ATP (50 μm), GTP (50 μm), and [α-32P]CTP without UTP. The resulting 135-nucleotide transcripts were then elongated in the absence or presence of Holo-ELL complex (from step X) following the addition of UTP (final concentration, 2 μm) and a large excess of nonradioactive CTP. At the conclusion of the reactions, transcripts synthesized in the presence of the Holo-ELL complex were considerably longer than the transcripts synthesized in its absence (data not shown). This indicates that the Holo-ELL complex is capable of increasing the rate of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II in the absence of initiation factors, which is also shown in both Figs.1 B and 3 C. We next tested whether the Holo-ELL complex could increase the rate of transcription from the AdML promoter in the presence of general initiation factors. Briefly, preinitiation complexes were assembled by preincubation of purified RNA polymerase II, TBP, TFIIB, TFIIE, and TFIIH with DNA template containing AdML promoter. After a short time, highly radioactive transcripts were synthesized during a brief pulse carried out in the presence of ATP, GTP, UTP, and a limiting concentration of [α-32P]CTP. These short promoter-specific transcripts were then elongated into full-length run-off transcripts in the presence or absence of the Holo-ELL complex (from step XI) and excess of nonradioactive CTP. As shown in Fig. 4 B, comparison of the kinetics of accumulation of full-length run-off transcripts reveals that the Holo-ELL can also stimulate the rate of transcription elongation of promoter-specific transcription by RNA polymerase II. Next we tested the ability of this complex to negatively regulate polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription, a property of ELL alone (3Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). As demonstrated previously, RNA polymerase II and the general initiation factors will synthesize the trinucleotide CpApC at the AdML promoter when provided with CpA and [α-32P]CTP (Fig. 5 A). The addition of recombinant ELL to the transcription reactions before the formation of preinitiation complex resulted in a substantial reduction in the yield of CpApC (Fig. 5 B). To our surprise, the addition of the purified Holo-ELL complex to transcription reactions before assembly of the preinitiation complex did not decrease the yield of CpApC synthesis (Fig. 5 C). This indicates that the transcriptional inhibitory activity of the ELL protein is suppressed in the Holo-ELL complex. ELL was discovered as a novel transcription elongation factor that undergoes frequent translocations in AML (1Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H. Simon M.C. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12110-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Mitani K. Kanda Y. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Inazawa J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H.

Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The original purification of ELL took advantage of chromatography systems that require the usage of denaturing solvents and conditions that can destroy multiprotein complexes. For this reason, the proteins associated with ELL were not identified initially. Here we report the identification and purification of ELL together with three other proteins that form the Holo-ELL complex. This ELL-containing complex was purified from crude rat liver extract to homogeneity following the purification scheme outlined in Fig. 2. The three other cellular proteins found in complex with ELL have molecular masses of 20, 30, and 45 kDa on SDS-PAGE. These proteins were named EAP20, EAP30, and EAP45, respectively (Fig. 3). The Holo-ELL complex was also shown to possess a native molecular mass of approximately 210 kDa on size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 3 D). Unlike the ELL polypeptide, the Holo-ELL complex is not capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription in vitro. The partner of ELL in acute myeloid leukemia is the product of theMLL gene, which encodes a large, multi-domain 3,968-amino acid protein. It contains an N-terminal A-T hook DNA-binding domain, a methyltransferase-like domain, and a C-terminal trithorax-like region composed of a transcriptional activation domain and several contiguous zinc fingers (9Prasad R. Yano T. Sorio C. Nakamura T. Rallapalli R. Gu Y. Leshkowitz D. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 10Rabbitts T.H.

Characterization of chromosomal abnormalities in a large number of human cancers revealed the MLL gene to be a recurring target for translocation in a variety of clinically distinct leukemias. Although nine other translocation partners of MLL have been cloned (10Rabbitts T.H. Nature. 1994; 372: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar), ELL is the only partner whose function is known (4Shilatifard A. Lane W.S. Jackson K.W. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1873-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The breakpoint of every MLL translocation creates a putative oncogene that encodes nearly the entire translocation partner fused to the N terminus domain of the MLL protein (12Aso T. Shilatifard A. Conaway J.W. Conaway R.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1561-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The fact that all these translocations occur within the same region of MLL but each is associated with a clinically distinct form of leukemia suggests that the MLL translocation partners, such as ELL, play a major role in determining the leukemic phenotype. Recently, it was demonstrated that the replacement of the normal MLL gene with an MLL-AF9 chimera led to the development of leukemia in mice, suggesting that translocation to an appropriate partner is the cause for the development of AML (13Corral J. Lavenir I. Impey H. Warren A.J. Forster A. Larson T.A. Bell S. McKenzie A.N.J. King G. Rabbitts T.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 853-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Why ELL is involved in leukemia still a mystery. However, ELL contains an N-terminal novel Pol II interaction domain that is capable of negatively regulating polymerase activity in promoter-specific transcription initiation in vitro (3Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). ELL deletions of the fifty N-terminal amino acids are fully active in elongation and can interact with Pol II; however, such mutants failed to inhibit initiation by Pol II (3Shilatifard A. Haque D. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22355-22363Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the MLL-ELL translocation that is found in patients with AML results in the deletion of exactly this functional domain (1Thirman M.J. Levitan D.A. Kobayashi H. Simon M.C. Rowley J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12110-12114Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 2Mitani K. Kanda Y. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Inazawa J. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1995; 85: 2017-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The discovery of ELL-associated proteins that can suppress its transcriptional inhibitory activity suggests that one or more of the ELL-associated proteins interacts or at least renders nonfunctional the N-terminal domain of the ELL protein, which were shown to be important for the transcriptional inhibitory activity of ELL. In this view, the interaction of ELL with one of the EAPs normally regulates the transcriptional inhibitory activity of ELL in vivo, and deletion of this functional domain of ELL (i.e. MLL-ELL translocation) bypasses this regulation. This hypothesis would provide a mechanism whereby the translocation could result in the loss of regulation of promoter-specific initiation of transcription, which would in turn result in the loss of growth regulation. In summary, most of the regulation of gene expression, which is crucial for normal growth and development, occurs at the level of DNA transcription. In the last three years, the regulation of transcription elongation has come to the forefront as a result of discoveries that loss of regulation of transcription is associated with variety of human diseases (4Shilatifard A.

The discovery of a large ELL-containing complex and the possible regulation of the transcriptional activities of ELL via its interacting proteins has shed new light on the regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II and its accessory factors and provides a new hypothesis for why the MLL-ELL translocation leads to the development of leukemia.

We have previously shown that in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, fluoroaluminate stimulates G protein-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Šuša, M., Standke, G. J. R., Jeschke, M., and Rohner, D. (1997) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 235, 680–684). Although the Ser/Thr kinases Erk1, Erk2, and p70S6K were activated in response to fluoroaluminate, the identity of fluoroaluminate-activated tyrosine kinase(s) remained elusive. In this study, we show that in MC3T3-E1 cells, fluoroaluminate induces a 110-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein that we identify as Pyk2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase related to Fak (focal adhesion kinase). The tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 increased in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The autophosphorylation activity of Pyk2 increased 3-fold and reached its maximum within 10 min of fluoroaluminate treatment. Fluoroaluminate also induced activation of Src and the association of Pyk2 with Src. The phosphorylation of Src-associated Pyk2 increased >20-fold in in vitro kinase assays, suggesting that Pyk2 is phosphorylated by Src. Although MC3T3-E1 cells express much more Fak than Pyk2, Src preferentially associated with Pyk2. In vitro, Pyk2 bound to the Src SH2 domain, suggesting that this interaction mediates the Src-Pyk2 association in cells. These data indicate that osteoblastic cells express Pyk2, which is tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated in response to G protein activation by fluoroaluminate, and that the mechanism of Pyk2 activation most likely involves Src. Thus, Src and Pyk2 are tyrosine kinases involved in G protein-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in osteoblastic cells and may be important for the osteogenic action of fluoroaluminate.

Fluoride has been known as a bone-forming agent for more than 100 years. Together, the occurrence of osteosclerosis in miners exposed to a mineral consisting of sodium aluminum fluoride (Na3AlF6), the effect of fluoridation of drinking water on bone mass in humans, as well as recent animal studies suggest that fluoride in complex with aluminum is capable of increasing bone formation (reviewed in Refs. 1Pak C.Y.

Res. 1996; 11: 46-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, a narrow therapeutic window and the questionable quality of newly formed bone prevented the wide use of fluoride for the treatment of osteoporotic patients. A promising new treatment using fluoride has recently been offered in the form of slow-release sodium fluoride (reviewed in Ref.3Pak C.Y.C. Zerwekh J.E. Antich P.P. Bell N.H. Singer F.R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1996; 11: 561-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Despite difficulties in its therapeutic use, fluoride remains an interesting bone anabolic agent. Understanding the molecular actions of fluoride on bone is expected to enable the development of drugs that would mimic its anabolic action and could overcome problems of the narrow therapeutic window and side effects. Little is known about the molecular mechanism of fluoride action in bone at the cellular level. Fluoride in a complex with aluminum (fluoroaluminate, most likely AlF4−) (4Chabre M. Trends Biochem.

Numerous reports indicate that in cultures of isolated primary osteoblastic cells as well as osteoblastic cell lines, fluoride and fluoroaluminate can induce proliferation (2Caverzasio J. Imai T.

Metab. 1996; 81: 2570-2578Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) have recently reported that fluoroaluminate and fluoride increase protein tyrosine phosphorylation in osteoblast-like cells. In our system, fluoroaluminate induced prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins with apparent molecular masses of ∼70, 120, and 130 kDa (17Šuša M. Standke G.J.R. Jeschke M. Rohner D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, the identity of tyrosine kinases mediating fluoroaluminate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation has remained elusive. In this study, we describe the tyrosine phosphorylation of a previously undetected 110-kDa protein in response to treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells with fluoroaluminate. The phosphorylation of this protein was weaker than the tyrosine phosphorylation of major proteins that were previously described, and its resolution from the major 120-kDa protein was critical for its detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this 110-kDa protein is immunologically indistinguishable from Pyk2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2), a recently described tyrosine kinase shown to be regulated by G protein-coupled receptors in neuronal cells (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 47-50Crossref Scopus (880) Google Scholar). This finding prompted us to investigate the mechanism of Pyk2 activation by fluoroaluminate in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. NaF was purchased from Fluka, and AlCl3, bradykinin, protein A-Sepharose CL-4B, and protein G-Sepharose 4B Fast Flow were from Sigma. Fluoroaluminate solution was prepared immediately before the experiment by mixing stock solutions (500 mm NaF and 10 mm AlCl3) to give a final concentration of 10 mm NaF and 10 μm AlCl3, which has been recommended for formation of fluoroaluminate complexes (4Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). [32P]ATP (specific activity of 3000 Ci/mmol) was acquired from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The SH2 domains immobilized on agarose beads were from Oncogene Science Inc. (PhosphoBind™ SH2 reagents). Antibodies were obtained from the following sources: anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), anti-Fak monoclonal antibody (mAb) 1The abbreviations used are: mAb, monoclonal antibody; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PI, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. 2A7 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Transduction Laboratories), goat anti-Pyk2 polyclonal antibody (raised against amino acids 990–1009 of human Pyk2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel), anti-Src monoclonal antibodies LA-074 (Quality Technology Inc.) and 05-184 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), and anti-Src polyclonal antibody SRC2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mouse osteoblastic cell line MC3T3-E1 was provided by Dr. J. Caverzasio (University of Geneva, Geneva, Switzerland). Cells were cultured in α-minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin/streptomycin, and l-glutamine. For experiments, cells were grown in 10- or 15-cm tissue culture dishes for 3 days to ∼90% confluency. Prior to stimulation, cell cultures were generally deprived of growth factors for 24 h in the absence of serum. PC12 cells and NIH3T3 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 12705 and CRL 1658, respectively). Human osteoblastic cells were derived from explants of trabecular bone as described (21Littlewood A.J. Aarden L.A. Evans D.B. Russell R.G. Gowen M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1991; 6: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); primary calvarial osteoblasts were isolated from 3–7-day-old MA01 mice as described (22Wezeman F.H. Corey J. Waxler B. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1990; 46: 263-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Agonist-treated MC3T3-E1 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin A) on ice for ∼15 min. Cleared cell lysates were obtained by subsequent centrifugation in a microcentrifuge (14,000 rpm at 4 °C for 5 min). Protein concentrations were determined using a Bradford micromethod (Bio-Rad). Proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels with an acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio of 150:1 at 25 mA/gel using a Bio-Rad Minigel apparatus. Electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) was performed overnight at 30 V and 4 °C (Bio-Rad Mini Trans-Blot unit). Blots were placed in blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline and 3% gelatin) for 1 h to prevent nonspecific binding, followed by incubation with a specific antibody for 1 h. Detection of immunoreactive bands was performed after incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The anti-Pyk2 polyclonal antibody was bound to 100 μl of a 1:1 mixture of protein A and protein G-Sepharose (protein A/G-Sepharose) in 500 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer by incubation at room temperature on a shaker for 1 h. Subsequently, the protein A/G-Sepharose beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer to remove unbound antibodies and resuspended in lysis buffer. An aliquot of cleared cell lysate prepared from fluoroaluminate-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells (200 μl, 150 μg of total protein) was incubated on ice with 5 μg of Pyk2-specific antibody prebound to protein A/G-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with the immobilized antibody again. Equal amounts of protein of the original lysate and of the supernatants after immunodepletion of Pyk2 were analyzed by Western blotting as described above. Cleared cell lysates were diluted with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer to a final protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody for 2–4 h on ice on an orbital shaker. The immune complexes were subsequently captured with 10 μl of protein A- or protein G-Sepharose for 30 min. The beads were washed twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40; twice with 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA; and once with 30 mm Tris (pH 7.5). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the NaCl concentration was 140 mm (nonstringent conditions). The proteins in immune complexes were analyzed either in kinase assays or by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blotting. For reprecipitation of denatured proteins from immune complex kinase assays, the immune complexes on protein A-Sepharose were boiled in SDS loading buffer to release immunoprecipitated proteins. Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant was diluted with 800 μl of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and used for immunoprecipitation as described above. Pyk2, Src, or Fak immune complexes were washed as described above. An additional wash was performed in kinase buffer (30 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 2 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmMnCl2). The protein kinase assays were performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer and 10 μCi of [32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) per reaction at 37 °C for 10 min. Immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of ice-cold NET (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA) to remove free [32P]ATP. The antigens were released from the beads by boiling them in 50 μl SDS of loading buffer and subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. Src immune complexes were separated on longer gels (8 × 9 cm, Mighty Minigel, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 20 mA/gel to achieve a better separation. Gels were dried and exposed on a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) for 4–40 h. The bands of interest were quantified with the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.) and corrected for background signal. Association of Pyk2 with SH2 domains of phospholipase Cγ, PI 3-kinase (C-terminal SH2 domain), and Src was measured using PhosphoBind™ SH2 reagents according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer (Oncogene Science Inc.). Briefly, Pyk2 was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of cellular protein and allowed to autophosphorylate in the presence of [32P]ATP in vitro as described above. The 32P-labeled Pyk2 was recovered from the beads by boiling in SDS loading buffer. The supernatant was harvested by centrifugation and diluted in SH2 binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). Equal volumes of diluted32P-labeled Pyk2 were added to 15 μl of each prewashed SH2-agarose conjugate or protein A-Sepharose and incubated for 2 h on ice. In parallel, immunoprecipitation of Pyk2 was done with 1 μg of anti-Pyk2 antibody. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of SH2 binding buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Association of native Pyk2 with SH2 domains was assessed by incubation of MC3T3-E1 cell extracts (1.5 mg of protein) with 15 μl of prewashed SH2-agarose conjugates on ice for 3 h. The beads were washed four times with 1 ml of SH2 binding buffer and once with kinase buffer. Associated kinases were allowed to autophosphorylate in the the presence of [32P]ATP. Proteins were dissociated from the resin by boiling in SDS loading buffer and were subsequently diluted in 1 ml of Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 5 mmdithiothreitol. Pyk2 was reprecipitated using 2 μg of anti-Pyk2 polyclonal antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of32P-labeled Pyk2 was analyzed with a PhosphorImager. Previously, we had shown that fluoroaluminate induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells, which reached a maximum between 30 and 60 min of stimulation (17Šuša M. Standke G.J.R. Jeschke M. Rohner D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 235: 680-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Here, we have stimulated serum-depleted cultures with 10 mm NaF and 10 μm AlCl3 for 20 min. Control cells were left untreated or were treated with 10 μm AlCl3. In addition to previously observed tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120, 130, and 65–70 kDa, more precise analysis of the Western blots revealed enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of another 110-kDa protein (Fig. 1 A) that is herein referred to as p110. NaF alone induced a qualitatively identical but weaker phosphotyrosine increase (data not shown). Stimulation of MC3T3-E1 cells with 10 μm AlCl3 did not result in an alteration of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 1 A). To examine the kinetics of p110 tyrosine phosphorylation, MC3T3-E1 cells were treated with fluoroaluminate for 1–90 min. Increased p110 tyrosine phosphorylation was evident 2 min after addition of fluoroaluminate to MC3T3-E1 cells and reached a maximum ∼15 min after fluoroaluminate addition, remaining high for as long as 40 min (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). It is intriguing that the p110 phosphorylation is weak in comparison to phosphorylated Fak, which is responsible for the strong signal detected just above Pyk2. Fak was identified as the band above Pyk2 by immunodepletion of Fak from MC3T3-E1 lysates (data not shown). To investigate whether p110 is involved in receptor-mediated, G protein-coupled signaling in osteoblasts, the ability of bradykinin to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of p110 was evaluated. Bradykinin receptors are seven-transmembrane receptors considered to couple to the Gq class of Gα proteins and are present on MC3T3-E1 cells (23Tokuda H. Kotoyori J. Oiso Y. Kozawa O. Endocr. J. 1994; 41: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Treatment of the cells with bradykinin caused a rapid and transient tyrosine phosphorylation of p110 (Fig. 1 B,lower panel), which was maximal after 1 min and was followed by a fast decline to basal levels after 5 min of treatment. The identity of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein migrating below p110 in bradykinin-treated cells is not known, but its phosphorylation was induced to a greater degree by bradykinin than by fluoroaluminate. The delayed response of p110 tyrosine phosphorylation with fluoroaluminateversus bradykinin is likely caused by the fact that bradykinin, in contrast to fluoroaluminate, does not need to pass the cell membrane in order to activate intracellular signaling. Tyrosine phosphorylation of p110 was also rapidly and transiently induced by other agonists of G protein-coupled receptors, such as thrombin and endothelin-1 (data not shown). These experiments indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation of the p110 protein is a common event in G protein-mediated signal transduction in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Pyk2, a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase of the Fak family, has recently been shown to participate in signal transduction involving G protein-coupled receptors (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 47-50Crossref Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Pyk2 has an apparent molecular mass of 112 kDa (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar) and could therefore be a candidate for the 110-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein detected in fluoroaluminate-treated osteoblasts. Pyk2 has been reported to have a restricted tissue distribution (24Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H. Kotani K. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21206-21219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 25Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 31222-31226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), but no data are available about the presence of the kinase in bone cells. To evaluate whether or not Pyk2 is expressed in osteoblastic cells, Pyk2 levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis of extracts from different cell lines and from primary human osteoblast-like cells using an anti-Pyk2 polyclonal antibody that does not cross-react with Fak (see “Experimental Procedures”) (Fig. 2 A). An immunoreactive band of the expected molecular mass was detected in MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 2 A). The signal was stronger in rat pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells, which have been reported to abundantly express Pyk2 (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 27Tokiwa G. Dikic I. Lev S. Schlessinger J. Science. 1996; 273: 792-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Consistent with earlier observations (25Mitaka T. Shindoh M. Mochizuki Y. Sasaki H. Ishino M. Matsuya M. Ninomiya T. Sasaki T. Am. J. Pathol. 1997; 150: 267-281PubMed Google Scholar), Pyk2 was not detected in NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Low amounts of Pyk2 were present in primary human osteoblasts (Fig. 2 A) and primary mouse osteoblasts (data not shown), suggesting that Pyk2 is expressed in osteoblasts in situ. The protein kinase activity of Pyk2 was demonstrated by immune complex kinase assay (Fig. 2 B). Pyk2 and Fak were immunoprecipitated from fluoroaluminate-treated MC3T3-E1 cells (10 mm NaF and 10 μm AlCl3 for 20 min), and the washed immune complexes were allowed to autophosphorylate in kinase buffer containing [32P]ATP in the absence of endogenous substrate. As expected, the autoradiogram revealed a single strongly phosphorylated protein in the Pyk2 immune complexes that had a slightly greater mobility than autophosphorylated Fak (Fig. 2 B). Taken together, these data provide evidence that Pyk2 and Fak are expressed and are catalytically active in osteoblastic cells. Pyk2 comigrated with the previously mentioned p110 on SDS-polyacrylamide gel, suggesting that it might be identical to p110 (data not shown). To test this hypothesis, immunodepletion of Pyk2 from fluoroaluminate-stimulated cells was performed (Fig. 2 C). The original extract (L) as well as Pyk2-deprived extracts from subsequent incubations with immobilized anti-Pyk2 antibodies (S1 and S2) were analyzed by Western blotting for tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (Fig. 2 C, upper panel) and for the presence of Pyk2 (lower panel). Pyk2 was efficiently removed from the MC3T3-E1 cell extract after the first incubation with the Pyk2 immunoaffinity resin (Fig. 2 C,lower panel, S1). On the anti-phosphotyrosine Western blot, the p110 signal selectively disappeared (Fig. 2 C, upper panel, S1 andS2). These results strongly suggest that p110 is identical to Pyk2. The data shown above indicated that Pyk2 is expressed in the MC3T3-E1 cell line and in primary human osteoblast-like cells and that fluoroaluminate can stimulate Pyk2 phosphorylation in MC3T3-E1 cells. To investigate whether fluoroaluminate-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation also occurs in primary cells, we measured Pyk2 phosphorylation in primary cultures of murine calvarial osteoblasts. These cultures expressed higher amounts of Pyk2 compared with human osteoblast-like cells (data not shown). Pyk2 was immunoprecipitated, and its phosphorylation was analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting. In these primary cultures, fluoroaluminate-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 increased with time of treatment up to 60 min (Fig. 3 A). A Western blot for Pyk2 was done to confirm that equal amounts of Pyk2 were present in Pyk2 precipitates (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that fluoroaluminate induces Pyk2 phosphorylation in primary cultures of osteoblast-like cells and not only in a cell line. As shown in Fig. 1, p110/Pyk2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to fluoroaluminate. Increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in response to G protein-coupled receptor agonists has been reported by several groups (19Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 20Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29993-29998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). However, the autocatalytic activity of Pyk2 was either unchanged (30Astier A. Avraham H. Manie S.N. Groopman J. Canty T. Avraham S. Freedman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) or not documented in most studies. In this study, we consistently observed a maximal 2–3-fold increase in Pyk2 kinase activity upon fluoroaluminate treatment of MC3T3-E1 cells (Fig. 4). The dose dependence of this effect was studied by treating MC3T3-E1 cells for 30 min with different concentrations of fluoroaluminate, and Pyk2 activation was analyzed in Pyk2 immune complex kinase assays (Fig. 4 A). Maximal autocatalytic activity of Pyk2 was detected with 10 mm NaF (Fig. 4 A). The kinetics of the autophosphorylation of Pyk2 were studied by analyzing extracts of cells that had been treated for increasing periods of time with fluoroaluminate (1–90 min). Stimulation of osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells with fluoroaluminate induced a rapid elevation of Pyk2 kinase activity (Fig. 4 B). The peak of Pyk2 activity was reached after 10–15 min of treatment and declined slowly over 1.5–2 h to basal activity. Elevated Pyk2 kinase activity was also measured with enolase as an exogenous substrate (data not shown). Thus, the data from the immune complex kinase assays suggest that activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by fluoroaluminate induces a moderate, but reproducible increase in Pyk2 kinase activity in MC3T3-E1 cells. To detect if other protein kinases are present in Pyk2 immune complexes, the gels from Fig. 4 (A and B) were exposed longer, and one weak additional 32P-phosphorylated protein became visible, which was identical to Src tyrosine kinase (data not shown; see also Fig. 5). It is unlikely that the very small amounts of Src in Pyk2 autophosphorylation reactions account for the strong 32P incorporation into Pyk2 in the in vitro kinase assay since coprecipitated Src was not highly active (weak autophosphorylation detected only after long exposures), and its kinetics of activation are faster than those of Pyk2 (compare Figs.4 B and 5 B). Nevertheless, this result indicated that Src and Pyk2 may physically associate (see below). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Pyk2 in MC3T3-E1 cells was tested in Pyk2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 C, upper panel). Fluoroaluminate-induced Pyk2 phosphorylation increased with time up to 40 min and remained high up to 60 min."

Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that most positions can tolerate considerable variation in R group conformation or charge and still permit D1 function. However, particular residues may be necessary for optimal PSII activity or may provide functional advantages under certain environmental conditions (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 12Kless H. Oren-Shamir M. Malkin S. McIntosh L. Edelman M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10501-10507Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Analysis of site-directed mutations in the region between Ile248 and Ala251 at one end of the parallel helix has led to the hypothesis that these residues may be buried in the thylakoid membrane (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), thus dividing the IV–V loop of D1 into two segments. One segment is postulated to be involved in QB binding and herbicide resistance (from the parallel helix to the helix V) and the other possibly in D1 degradation (from helix IV to the parallel helix).Substitution of Val for Ala251 in the D1 protein in cyanobacteria and Chlamydomonas results in herbicide resistance and increased sensitivity to photoinhibition (13Johanningmeier U. Bodner U. Wildner G.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 221-224Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Kirilovsky D. Ajlani G. Picaud M. Etienne A.-L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), reduced photosynthetic yield associated with slower photoautotrophic growth (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Crofts A.R. Baroli I. Kramer D. Taoka S. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1993; 48: 259-266Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and perturbation of the pattern of oxygen evolution in single turnover flashes (16Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). To examine further the role of the D1 Ala251 residue in PSII function and light sensitivity, we generated 12 of the 19 possible amino acid substitutions at this position in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Five of these substitutions (Arg, Asp, Gln, Glu, and His) were shown to lead to a nonphotosynthetic phenotype and to impaired D1 synthesis and accumulation (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Seven (Cys, Gly, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, and Val), which retain photosynthetic function to various degrees, affect herbicide resistance and photoautotrophic growth rates to various degrees (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In this paper, we examine D1 synthesis and turnover, photosynthetic rate, quantum efficiency, and electron transfer between QAand QB in these seven mutants. We also show that the bulkiness of the R group of the amino acid substituted in each of 12 Ala251 mutants is correlated with the dissociation constant (K O) for plastoquinone in the QBpocket, consistent with the hypothesis that the Ala251residue of D1 is structurally involved in QB binding and is likely to be buried in the thylakoid membrane (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have used a combination of biophysical, biochemical, and physiological assays to characterize the effects of seven amino acid substitutions at the Ala251 residue of the D1 protein that result in varying levels of photoautotrophic competence. These seven mutants and the five nonphotosynthetic Ala251 D1 mutants we characterized previously (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) can be grouped into four phenotypic classes with respect to D1 synthesis and steady state level, photosynthetic capacity, photoautotrophic growth rate, and herbicide resistance (Fig. 6): 1) similar to wild type (A251C*), 2) impaired in photosynthesis but not in photoautotrophic growth (A251G*, A251P*, and A251S*), 3) markedly impaired in photoautotrophic growth and photosynthesis and herbicide-resistant (A251I*, A251L*, and A251V*), and 4) not photosynthetically competent (A251R*, A251D*, A251Q*, A251E* and A251H*). The effects of the individual amino acid substitutions on D1 synthesis/accumulation, growth, and carbon accumulation, O2evolution, composition of the PSII reaction centers, and QAto QB electron transfer will be considered below.The Arg, Asp, Gln, Glu, and His SubstitutionsPreviously, we showed that these five amino acid substitutions at the Ala251 D1 residue led to a nonphotosynthetic phenotype, markedly impaired D1 synthesis and accumulation, and severely affected primary photochemical charge separation efficiency (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Here, we report that electron transfer between QA and QBis almost completely blocked in these five mutants (Table III). No binding of QB in its niche on the D1 protein could be detected in these strains. Electrons that can be extracted from water oxidation are blocked at the primary quinone acceptor QA, which has been suggested to lead to a doubly reduced QA2− (36Vass I. Styring S. Hundal T. Koivuniemi A. Aro E.-M. Anderson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1408-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This could increase the possibility for recombination of the radical pair P680+/Phe− and generate highly toxic 1O2 via the3P680 state (37Keren N. Berg A. Van Kam P.J.M. Levanon H. Ohad I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1579-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The conformation of the IV–V loop of the D1 protein in these mutants is presumably structurally altered compared with wild type (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Importance of the Ala251 Residue Deduced from Suppressor Analysis of the Nonphotosynthetic A251R* MutantAmong about 40 isolates recovered after acetate starvation of the nonphotosynthetic A251R* mutant and sequenced, only same site suppressors were obtained. This strongly suggests that other mutations in the D1 protein or in other chloroplast proteins are unable to compensate for the structural modification caused by insertion of a bulky, charged amino acid at position 251. These results reinforce the hypothesis that the amino acid residue present at position 251 plays a critical role in conformation and function of the IV–V loop (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 16Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 35Sobolev V. Edelman M. Proteins. 1995; 21: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).The Cys SubstitutionFor most of the parameters analyzed, the A251C* mutant appears indistinguishable from the wild type A251A* control (this paper and Ref. 17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, detailed analysis of the electron flow between water and the plastoquinone pool in the thylakoid membranes indicated a noticeable reduction in the rate of QA− reoxidation and a destabilized S2QB−(S3QB−) state, which can be attributed to a shift of the apparent equilibrium constant (K app) between QA− QB and QAQB− (Table III). Although the Cys substitution has some impact on the electron transfer between QA and QB, this mutant is able to grow and evolve O2 as well as wild type under LL and HL (Table I), photoacclimates properly during growth in HL by down-regulating its LHCP and chlorophyll levels (Fig. 2 B and Table I), and does not show resistance to PSII herbicides (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the MTF/STF ratio in A251C* (Table III), the ability of this mutant to reduce fully its plastoquinone pool, as well as its overall rate of electron transport from water to the terminal acceptors, is similar to wild type. Cysteine possesses a reversibly reducible SH group, which might help mediate electron flow between QA and QB. This could explain why the overall photosynthetic output and biomass production in this mutant are indistinguishable from those of wild type.D1 turnover in A251C* appears to be increased slightly (Fig. 3), although D1 accumulation is comparable with that of the A251A* control strain (Fig. 2). Although no obvious signs of photoinduced PSII damage have been detected under our experimental conditions (Tables Table I, Table II, Table III), the slight increase in the rates of D1 synthesis (3.5 × 105 versus 3.0 × 105) and turnover (−13.9 × 103 versus −13.5 × 103) observed in this mutant compared with wild type (Fig. 3) might nevertheless indicate an elevated repair of photodamaged PSII centers. Alternatively, the Cys substitution might affect the susceptibility of D1 to normal degradative processes. In either case, if the rate of D1 repair is sufficient to match the rate of D1 degradation caused by the Cys substitution, the number of functional PSII centers would be expected to remain unaffected.The Gly, Pro, and Ser SubstitutionsThe A251G*, A251S*, and to a lesser extent A251P* mutants are not only markedly impaired in the electron transfer between QA and QB but also in efficiency of primary photochemical charge separation (Tables II andIII). These defects on the acceptor and donor sides of D1 lead to an overall reduction of the photosynthetic function (Table I) and to an increased PSII excitation pressure (Table II and Fig. 4). The mutants also fail to down-regulate their chlorophyll content normally when grown in HL (Table I) and have been shown to contain a larger functional antenna per PSII reaction center and lower probability of excitation energy transfer between the reaction centers than wild type (Table II). This observation is corroborated by immunoblot analysis showing that LHCP accumulation was also not down-regulated to the level of the wild type control under HL (Fig. 2).The redox state of the plastoquinone pool in the thylakoid membrane has been shown to regulate expression of the nuclear cab gene encoding LHCP by molecular signaling (34Escoubas J.-M. Lomas M. LaRoche J. Falkowski P.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10237-10241Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 38Allen J.F. Alexciev K. Håkansson G. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 869-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Reduced plastoquinone was postulated to repress cab gene transcription via a signaling pathway involving a phosphorylated factor coupled to the redox state of plastoquinone through a chloroplast kinase. Substitutions of Gly, Pro, and Ser for Ala251 slow the electron transfer rate between QA and QB (TableIII) and therefore result in a mainly oxidized quinone pool in the membrane, which might prevent redox repression of cab gene transcription in HL. Because the mutant cells would no longer sense the difference in redox state under HL, cab gene expression would continue at almost the same level as in LL, resulting in accumulation of LHCP-bound chlorophyll in the antennae.If a reduction in the number of chlorophyll molecules harvesting light ameliorates the potentially destructive redox chemistry occurring in chloroplasts exposed to bright light, the question arises as to why the A251G*, A251P*, and A251S* mutants with their large antennae grow as well as wild type under HL (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Decreases in PSII centers per cell seen in these three mutants (Table II) might be a consequence of photodamage or might reflect another adaptation of the cell to the HL environment. Photoinhibition has been defined as a light-dependent decrease in maximum photosynthetic efficiency (39Osmond C.B. Baker N.R. Bowyer J.R. Photoinhibition of Photosynthesis: From Molecular Mechanisms to the Field. Bios Scientific, Oxford, UK1994: 1-24Google Scholar), which results in damage and degradation of the D1 protein. For example, in A251G* and A251P*, D1 synthesis in short term pulse-chase experiments is reduced by about one-third, whereas D1 turnover is increased by 27 and 73%, respectively, compared with wild type (Fig. 3). These mutants also tend to accumulate less D1 than wild type (Fig. 2). Alternatively, photoinhibition may be considered a mechanism that matches overall photosynthetic electron flow to the photon flux rate through the down-regulation of PSII photochemistry (40Öquist G. Chow W.S. Anderson J.M. Planta. 1992; 186: 450-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 41van Wijk K.J. van Hasselt P.R. Planta. 1993; 189: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 42Gray G.R. Savitch L.V. Ivanov A.G. Huner N.P.A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 61-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In fact, the decrease in the number of PSII reaction centers per cell observed in A251G*, A251P*, and A251S* (Table II) might reflect an adjustment of the photosynthetic electron transport system to high PSII excitation pressure.The 3.3-h photoautotrophic doubling times obtained with wild typeC. reinhardtii, A251C* and the A251G*, A251P*, and A251S* mutants in microtiter plates under optimum conditions (saturating light and CO2) (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) are the shortest known for this alga. Hence, our observation that the growth rate of the latter three mutants is not photosensitive under these conditions suggests that photosynthetic electron transfer from QA to the plastoquinone pool is not rate-limiting for overall photosynthetic electron flow at light saturation. The calculated time for whole chain electron transport (τWC, Table II) shows no correlation withK app (Table III) in these mutants. Sukeniket al. (43Sukenik A. Bennett J. Falkowski P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 891: 205-215Crossref Scopus (248) Google Scholar) have shown that 1/τWC is correlated with carboxylation in the Calvin cycle rather than electron transport reactions within the thylakoid membranes. A similar discrepancy between photoautotrophic growth and photosynthetic efficiency has been observed in certain cyanobacterial mutants altering the CP47 polypeptide of PSII (44Putnam-Evans C. Wi J. Bricker T.M. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 1191-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).The Ile, Leu, and Val SubstitutionsReplacement of Val for Ala251, the only substitution at this position previously characterized in cyanobacteria and in C. reinhardtii, has been reported to result in resistance to certain PSII herbicides and increased the sensitivity to photoinhibition (13Johanningmeier U. Bodner U. Wildner G.F. FEBS Lett. 1987; 211: 221-224Crossref Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Kirilovsky D. Ajlani G. Picaud M. Etienne A.-L. Plant Mol. Biol. 1989; 13: 355-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cyanobacterial mutation was subsequently shown to affect the apparent equilibrium constant on the acceptor side (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the properties of the oxygen-evolving complex on the donor side (16Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The phenotype of the new A251V* mutant of C. reinhardtii characterized in this paper is similar to that of the two aforementioned Val mutants. In addition, we created and characterized Ile and Leu substitutions that fall into the same phenotypic category (this paper and Ref. 17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on herbicide resistance, we find the A251I* and A251V* mutants to be virtually identical, while the A251L* mutant results in a more extreme herbicide resistant and photosynthetic defective phenotype.A251I* and A251L*, and to a lesser extent A251V*, are severely impaired in the QA → QB electron transfer as indicated by a very slow reoxidation rate of QA−, a high instability of QB−, and a large shift in the equilibrium constant K app (TableIII) but do not show any impairment in the primary charge separation (Table II). In contrast to the Gly, Pro, and Ser substitutions, the reduced photosynthetic yield in A251I*, A251L*, and A251V* is associated with slower photoautotrophic growth and increased herbicide resistance (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these defects are observed at both LL and HL, and they differ from those in the herbicide-resistant Ser264 to Ala D1 mutant, which shows reduced growth only in HL (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Electron transfer on the acceptor side of the D1 protein is greatly impaired in A251I*, A251V*, and A251L* (Table III), leading to high PSII steady state levels of reduced QA−as indicated by reduced qP values (Fig. 4). Given our finding that A251L* accumulates at least as much D1 as wild type (Fig. 2), the 30% increase in the rate of D1 synthesis seen in the pulse experiments appears to offset the 47% increase in the rate of degradation measured in chase experiments compared with wild type (Fig. 3).Properties of the Amino Acid at Position 251 in Relation to D1 Structure and FunctionIn cyanobacteria, amino acids 248–251 of the IV–V loop of the D1 protein are thought to be buried in the thylakoid membrane, dividing the loop into two functional domains (11Etienne A.-L. Kirilovsky D. Photosynth. Res. 1993; 38: 387-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar,16Perewoska I. Etienne A.-L. Miranda T. Kirilovsky D. Plant Physiol. 1994; 104: 235-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our grouping of the 12 Ala251 mutants of C. reinhardtii into four phenotypic classes in terms of their effects on photosynthetic efficiency, photoautotrophic growth, and herbicide resistance (Fig. 6) relative to the nature of the substituted R group is consistent with the present structural models of the IV–V loop. Insertion of a charged or polar and relatively bulky amino acid at this position (e.g. Arg, Asp, Gln, Glu, or His) would be predicted to destroy the conformation of the D1 IV–V loop because of interactions of the R groups of these amino acids with polar heads of the lipid bilayer of the thylakoid (10Lardans A. Gillham N.W. Boynton J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 210-217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This is consistent with the total blockage of the electron flow between QA and QB and the nonphotosynthetic phenotype observed in these five mutants.Substitution of Ala251 with an uncharged amino acid having a bulky side chain (Fig. 5, e.g. Ile, Leu, or Val) does not disrupt D1 function completely but impairs photosynthetic electron transfer to various extents that appear to correlate with the position of the methyl group on the R group. Leu, whose methyl group is attached at C-3, has a more severe phenotype than Ile and Val, which have methyl groups attached at C-2. In contrast, substitution of small uncharged amino acids for Ala251 (e.g. Cys, Gly, Pro, or Ser) has no effect on the mutants' photoautotrophic growth or herbicide sensitivity (17Förster B. Heifetz P.B. Lardans A. Boynton J.E. Gillham N.W. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1997; 52: 654-664Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and photosynthetic O2 evolution, but all four mutations affect the function of the QBbinding niche to varying degrees. In the case of the Gly, Pro, and Ser substitutions, the acceptor side of PSII is affected. The effect of the Ser and Pro substitutions may be related to the polarizable hydroxyl group and five-ring structure, respectively, in the R groups of these two amino acids. That Gly, which has a hydrogen attached to the carbon backbone instead of the methyl group in the normal Ala residue, perturbs function suggests that steric interactions on the side chain are critical for plastoquinone binding. Interestingly, substitution of Cys with a sulfhydryl group, results in the fewest biophysical, biochemical, and physical consequences of the 12 mutations examined. The fact that Cys can exist in either reduced or oxidized form might help mediate proton and/or electron transfer to plastoquinone in the QB pocket.In the case of the seven Ala251 mutants that retain the capacity for photoautotrophic growth, one has difficulty in correlating growth rate, carbon accumulation, and photosynthetic efficiency under LL and HL with the capacity for electron transfer between QA and QB. Furthermore, no correlation has been found between QB− stability and the rate of acceleration in D1 turnover. Hence, Chlamydomonasmay possess mechanisms for ameliorating the effects of reduced photosynthetic performance caused by certain of the Ala251mutations in the D1 protein and thus optimizing their fitness under particular environmental conditions. To identify other proteins and pathways involved in these processes, nuclear suppressors of the photosensitive A251I* and A251L* mutants have been isolated that have an elevated tolerance to very high light (2000 μmol m−2s−1), which is photoinhibitory both to these mutants and to wild type. Detailed characterization of these suppressors is now in progress.

Exposure to high temperature induces all organisms to synthesize a distinct group of proteins, the heat shock proteins (hsp), 1The abbreviations used are: hsp, heat shock protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: hsp, heat shock protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). many of which act as chaperones that assist in the folding or unfolding of other proteins (1Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). These activities are especially useful during cell exposure to high temperatures that denature proteins and can lead to protein aggregation, but they are also required under conditions of normal growth. The chaperone functions of prominent high molecular weight hsps, such as Hsp70, Hsp104, and Hsp60, depend on cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis; and cochaperones are required for optimal activity.We have been interested in understanding the roles of small hsps, which are strongly expressed in response to high temperature. These proteins were first characterized by their homology to eye lens α-crystallin (2Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), which is also a heat shock-induced protein in non-lens tissue (3Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Multiple small hsps are produced by several organisms, includingDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (4Plesofsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and they are especially abundant in plants, which have organellar as well as cytosolic forms of these proteins. The small hsps of diverse organisms show only limited sequence conservation, and their activities appear to be dispensable at normal temperature. However, overexpression of these proteins increased the resistance of mammalian cells to high temperature and toxic chemicals (5Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the single copy Hsp30 gene ofNeurospora crassa showed that this small hsp dramatically improves cell survival at high temperature, under conditions of glucose limitation (6Plesofsky-Vig N.

Like other hsps, the small hsps appear to be chaperones that in vitro prevent thermal aggregation of substrate proteins (7Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), but the targets of their chaperone activity in vivo and the nature of the requirements for this activity, including cooperation with cochaperones, are not yet known.Hsp30 is the sole α-crystallin-related small hsp of N. crassa (9Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15432-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is strongly induced by high temperature (45 °C). Under inducing conditions Hsp30 associates with membranes, chiefly with mitochondrial membranes, but it dissociates, becoming a soluble cytosolic protein at normal temperature (9Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15432-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the cellular and molecular roles played by Hsp30 during heat shock, we have attempted to identify cellular proteins that interact with Hsp30. We report here that two proteins, identified as Hsp70 and Hsp88, which is a previously uncharacterized protein, bind specifically to Hsp30 linked to a matrix in affinity chromatography. Furthermore, purified Hsp30 binds to an immobilized Hsp88-containing fusion protein. We determined the cDNA sequence of Hsp88 and aligned its predicted amino acid sequence with that of five related proteins, mammalian Hsp110 (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These proteins were also aligned with Hsp70, to which they are distantly related; and properties of these two classes of proteins were compared. This is the first report of a specific interaction between a small hsp and cellular proteins, whose identities suggest that they may be cochaperones.DISCUSSIONTo identify cellular proteins that interact with Hsp30, the small hsp of N. crassa, we analyzed proteins in a cellular extract that were retained by an Hsp30 affinity resin. We found that Hsp70 and Hsp88 specifically bound to immobilized Hsp30. We confirmed the identity of Hsp70 by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Hsp88 is a previously uncharacterized protein, whose cDNA we isolated and sequenced. Hsp88 appears to be a normal cellular constituent, whose expression increases severalfold in response to high temperature stress. Distantly related to Hsp70, Hsp88 is homologous to several recently characterized proteins, which are also reported to be induced by heat shock. Mammalian Hsp110 is one of the most strongly induced hsps in heat-stressed Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Murine Osp94, in addition to being induced by heat shock, is strongly synthesized in response to hyperosmotic stress (35Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12327-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These proteins localize chiefly to the cytosol, although Hsp110 is also peripherally associated with nucleoli (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Hsp105 with nuclei (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). N. crassa Hsp88 is also predominantly cytosolic with a minor portion being membrane-associated. Unlike Hsp70 and small hsps, these proteins do not appear to change their location in response to high temperature (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).There are consistent differences between the Hsp110 family proteins and Hsp70. The two Neurospora proteins have only 18% identity in their C-terminal putative peptide-binding domains, indicating extensive sequence divergence. In contrast their putative ATPase domains have 38% identity, and the recognized ATP-binding motifs are conserved in Hsp88. In our alignment of Hsp88-related and Hsp70 proteins, we found 49 identical and 67 similar residues conserved within the N-terminal domain and only 7 and 9, respectively, within the C-terminal domain. Nevertheless, properties of the N-terminal ATPase domains display surprising contrasts. This domain is more hydrophobic in Hsp88-related proteins than in Hsp70, due particularly to regions within three separate subdomains of the Hsc70 crystal structure, IA, IIA, and IIB (29Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Hsp88/Hsp110 ATPase domain is slightly basic, whereas this domain in Hsp70 is acidic. These properties would be expected to affect binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Hsp88 and related proteins. We found that binding of Hsp88 to ATP-agarose does not occur in the presence of Mg2+ but does occur when Mn2+ is the divalent cation, as has also been reported for purified Hsp90/Hsp83 (34Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp105 was also reported not to bind Mg2+ATP-agarose (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Except for Hsp70, other N. crassa proteins in addition to Hsp88, such as Hsp83 and Hsp98, also bind more strongly to Mn2+ATP- than to Mg2+ATP-agarose, with binding to Ca2+ATP-agarose being intermediate. The distinctive properties of the ATPase domain of Hsp88-related proteins are likely to influence the function of these proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the Ssb subgroup of Hsp70 is required for growth at low temperature, and domain swapping experiments showed that the N-terminal ATPase domain of Ssb1 is responsible for conferring this function (37James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The C-terminal domains of the Hsp88-related proteins and Hsp70 include a region of conserved sequence (Hsp88: 551–653) that corresponds to the α-helical region within the peptide-binding domain of E. coli DnaK, an Hsp70 homologue (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The preceding region of β structure in the peptide-binding domain is not conserved in Hsp110 family proteins, although it is more strongly conserved than the α-helical region among Hsp70s (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The β strands comprise the actual peptide-binding subdomain, and the α helices apparently form a lid over the peptide bound within the β sandwich. Movement of the longest α helix relative to the β sandwich, seen in an alternate crystal structure, may reflect nucleotide-induced conformational changes within DnaK (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation of the α subdomain suggests that the Hsp88-related proteins retain the Hsp70 mechanism of nucleotide-regulated peptide-binding and release. The lack of conservation of the β subdomain suggests that the actual peptides bound by these proteins differ.Several interactions between small hsps and purified protein substrates have been reported. For example, the small hsp of avian cells was found to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro (39Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Murine Hsp25 (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and pea Hsp18.1 (40Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) form complexes with unfolded citrate synthase and other model substrates, and α-crystallin binds to denatured proteins, including β- and γ-crystallins (41Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction that we have detected between Hsp30 and Hsp88 (and Hsp70) is the first report of complex formation between a small hsp and a protein selected from a cellular extract, and it implies that this association likely occurs in vivo. Hsp30 and Hsp88 appear to interact directly, since the purified proteins bind to one another in the absence of other components. This is also the first report that a member of the Hsp110 protein family associates with a specific protein.Hsp70 was the first hsp proposed to act as a chaperone (42Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and its effect on protein unfolding is well established (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of small hsps is only beginning to be understood; they appear to bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 40Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Under moderate conditions of heat stress, small hsps may be sufficient to reactivate substrate enzymes. We found that α-crystallin protected hexokinase activity from thermal inactivation, 3N. Plesofsky-Vig and R. Brambl, manuscript in preparation. and pea small hsps were reported to protect citrate synthase from being inactivated (7Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under more stringent conditions, however, in addition to murine Hsp25, reactivation of citrate synthase required Hsp70 and ATP, which apparently dissociated the Hsp25-citrate synthase complex (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). This suggests cooperation between Hsp25 and Hsp70. Small hsps were proposed to complex with unfolded proteins early in heat shock and to be released from substrate proteins by ATP-dependent chaperones, such as Hsp70, when ATP-generating processes recover in stressed cells (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The activity of most chaperones either requires or increases in cooperation with cochaperones. E. coli DnaK, for example, is aided by DnaJ, which enhances its ATPase activity, and by the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). The multi-protein complexes formed by Hsp90 with Hsp70, p60, immunophilins, and p23 are required for Hsp90 to bind to and activate unliganded steroid receptors (44Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The affinity binding we report between Hsp70 and Hsp30 may reflect the cooperation between these two classes of chaperone in reactivating a substrate enzyme in vitro (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hsp70, the binding of Hsp88 to Hsp30 is more selective and is not increased by a reaction temperature which denatures proteins in vitro(Table I). Furthermore, the interaction between purified Hsp88 and Hsp30 occurs in the absence of substrate proteins, implying that Hsp88 and Hsp30 may together form a chaperone complex before interacting with substrate proteins. An additional possibility is that the temperature-dependent dissociation of Hsp30 from membranes depends on Hsp88, which is located predominantly in the cytosol. Exposure to high temperature induces all organisms to synthesize a distinct group of proteins, the heat shock proteins (hsp), 1The abbreviations used are: hsp, heat shock protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). 1The abbreviations used are: hsp, heat shock protein; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s). many of which act as chaperones that assist in the folding or unfolding of other proteins (1Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.-U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 349-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar). These activities are especially useful during cell exposure to high temperatures that denature proteins and can lead to protein aggregation, but they are also required under conditions of normal growth. The chaperone functions of prominent high molecular weight hsps, such as Hsp70, Hsp104, and Hsp60, depend on cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis; and cochaperones are required for optimal activity. We have been interested in understanding the roles of small hsps, which are strongly expressed in response to high temperature. These proteins were first characterized by their homology to eye lens α-crystallin (2Ingolia T.D. Craig E.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar), which is also a heat shock-induced protein in non-lens tissue (3Klemenz R. Frohli E. Steiger R. Schafer R. Aoyama A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3652-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Multiple small hsps are produced by several organisms, includingDrosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans (4Plesofsky-Vig N. Vig J. Brambl R. J. Mol. Evol. 1992; 35: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and they are especially abundant in plants, which have organellar as well as cytosolic forms of these proteins. The small hsps of diverse organisms show only limited sequence conservation, and their activities appear to be dispensable at normal temperature. However, overexpression of these proteins increased the resistance of mammalian cells to high temperature and toxic chemicals (5Lavoie J.N. Gingras-Breton G. Tanguay R.M. Landry J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3420-3429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, disruption of the single copy Hsp30 gene ofNeurospora crassa showed that this small hsp dramatically improves cell survival at high temperature, under conditions of glucose limitation (6Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5032-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Like other hsps, the small hsps appear to be chaperones that in vitro prevent thermal aggregation of substrate proteins (7Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), but the targets of their chaperone activity in vivo and the nature of the requirements for this activity, including cooperation with cochaperones, are not yet known. Hsp30 is the sole α-crystallin-related small hsp of N. crassa (9Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15432-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is strongly induced by high temperature (45 °C). Under inducing conditions Hsp30 associates with membranes, chiefly with mitochondrial membranes, but it dissociates, becoming a soluble cytosolic protein at normal temperature (9Plesofsky-Vig N. Brambl R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15432-15440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To understand better the cellular and molecular roles played by Hsp30 during heat shock, we have attempted to identify cellular proteins that interact with Hsp30. We report here that two proteins, identified as Hsp70 and Hsp88, which is a previously uncharacterized protein, bind specifically to Hsp30 linked to a matrix in affinity chromatography. Furthermore, purified Hsp30 binds to an immobilized Hsp88-containing fusion protein. We determined the cDNA sequence of Hsp88 and aligned its predicted amino acid sequence with that of five related proteins, mammalian Hsp110 (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These proteins were also aligned with Hsp70, to which they are distantly related; and properties of these two classes of proteins were compared. This is the first report of a specific interaction between a small hsp and cellular proteins, whose identities suggest that they may be cochaperones. DISCUSSIONTo identify cellular proteins that interact with Hsp30, the small hsp of N. crassa, we analyzed proteins in a cellular extract that were retained by an Hsp30 affinity resin. We found that Hsp70 and Hsp88 specifically bound to immobilized Hsp30. We confirmed the identity of Hsp70 by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Hsp88 is a previously uncharacterized protein, whose cDNA we isolated and sequenced. Hsp88 appears to be a normal cellular constituent, whose expression increases severalfold in response to high temperature stress. Distantly related to Hsp70, Hsp88 is homologous to several recently characterized proteins, which are also reported to be induced by heat shock. Mammalian Hsp110 is one of the most strongly induced hsps in heat-stressed Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Murine Osp94, in addition to being induced by heat shock, is strongly synthesized in response to hyperosmotic stress (35Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12327-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These proteins localize chiefly to the cytosol, although Hsp110 is also peripherally associated with nucleoli (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Hsp105 with nuclei (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). N. crassa Hsp88 is also predominantly cytosolic with a minor portion being membrane-associated. Unlike Hsp70 and small hsps, these proteins do not appear to change their location in response to high temperature (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar).There are consistent differences between the Hsp110 family proteins and Hsp70. The two Neurospora proteins have only 18% identity in their C-terminal putative peptide-binding domains, indicating extensive sequence divergence. In contrast their putative ATPase domains have 38% identity, and the recognized ATP-binding motifs are conserved in Hsp88. In our alignment of Hsp88-related and Hsp70 proteins, we found 49 identical and 67 similar residues conserved within the N-terminal domain and only 7 and 9, respectively, within the C-terminal domain. Nevertheless, properties of the N-terminal ATPase domains display surprising contrasts. This domain is more hydrophobic in Hsp88-related proteins than in Hsp70, due particularly to regions within three separate subdomains of the Hsc70 crystal structure, IA, IIA, and IIB (29Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Hsp88/Hsp110 ATPase domain is slightly basic, whereas this domain in Hsp70 is acidic. These properties would be expected to affect binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Hsp88 and related proteins. We found that binding of Hsp88 to ATP-agarose does not occur in the presence of Mg2+ but does occur when Mn2+ is the divalent cation, as has also been reported for purified Hsp90/Hsp83 (34Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp105 was also reported not to bind Mg2+ATP-agarose (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Except for Hsp70, other N. crassa proteins in addition to Hsp88, such as Hsp83 and Hsp98, also bind more strongly to Mn2+ATP- than to Mg2+ATP-agarose, with binding to Ca2+ATP-agarose being intermediate. The distinctive properties of the ATPase domain of Hsp88-related proteins are likely to influence the function of these proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the Ssb subgroup of Hsp70 is required for growth at low temperature, and domain swapping experiments showed that the N-terminal ATPase domain of Ssb1 is responsible for conferring this function (37James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar).The C-terminal domains of the Hsp88-related proteins and Hsp70 include a region of conserved sequence (Hsp88: 551–653) that corresponds to the α-helical region within the peptide-binding domain of E. coli DnaK, an Hsp70 homologue (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The preceding region of β structure in the peptide-binding domain is not conserved in Hsp110 family proteins, although it is more strongly conserved than the α-helical region among Hsp70s (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The β strands comprise the actual peptide-binding subdomain, and the α helices apparently form a lid over the peptide bound within the β sandwich. Movement of the longest α helix relative to the β sandwich, seen in an alternate crystal structure, may reflect nucleotide-induced conformational changes within DnaK (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation of the α subdomain suggests that the Hsp88-related proteins retain the Hsp70 mechanism of nucleotide-regulated peptide-binding and release. The lack of conservation of the β subdomain suggests that the actual peptides bound by these proteins differ.Several interactions between small hsps and purified protein substrates have been reported. For example, the small hsp of avian cells was found to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro (39Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Murine Hsp25 (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and pea Hsp18.1 (40Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) form complexes with unfolded citrate synthase and other model substrates, and α-crystallin binds to denatured proteins, including β- and γ-crystallins (41Wang K. Spector A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13601-13608Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction that we have detected between Hsp30 and Hsp88 (and Hsp70) is the first report of complex formation between a small hsp and a protein selected from a cellular extract, and it implies that this association likely occurs in vivo. Hsp30 and Hsp88 appear to interact directly, since the purified proteins bind to one another in the absence of other components. This is also the first report that a member of the Hsp110 protein family associates with a specific protein.Hsp70 was the first hsp proposed to act as a chaperone (42Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3137-3143Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and its effect on protein unfolding is well established (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). The chaperone activity of small hsps is only beginning to be understood; they appear to bind to unfolded proteins and prevent their aggregation (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar, 40Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Under moderate conditions of heat stress, small hsps may be sufficient to reactivate substrate enzymes. We found that α-crystallin protected hexokinase activity from thermal inactivation, 3N. Plesofsky-Vig and R. Brambl, manuscript in preparation. and pea small hsps were reported to protect citrate synthase from being inactivated (7Lee G.J. Pokala N. Vierling E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10432-10438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Under more stringent conditions, however, in addition to murine Hsp25, reactivation of citrate synthase required Hsp70 and ATP, which apparently dissociated the Hsp25-citrate synthase complex (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). This suggests cooperation between Hsp25 and Hsp70. Small hsps were proposed to complex with unfolded proteins early in heat shock and to be released from substrate proteins by ATP-dependent chaperones, such as Hsp70, when ATP-generating processes recover in stressed cells (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The activity of most chaperones either requires or increases in cooperation with cochaperones. E. coli DnaK, for example, is aided by DnaJ, which enhances its ATPase activity, and by the nucleotide exchange factor GrpE (43Hartl F.U. Nature. 1996; 381: 571-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (3088) Google Scholar). The multi-protein complexes formed by Hsp90 with Hsp70, p60, immunophilins, and p23 are required for Hsp90 to bind to and activate unliganded steroid receptors (44Owens-Grillo J.K. Czar M.J. Hutchison K.A. Hoffmann K. Perdew G.H. Pratt W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13468-13475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).The affinity binding we report between Hsp70 and Hsp30 may reflect the cooperation between these two classes of chaperone in reactivating a substrate enzyme in vitro (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). In contrast to Hsp70, the binding of Hsp88 to Hsp30 is more selective and is not increased by a reaction temperature which denatures proteins in vitro(Table I). Furthermore, the interaction between purified Hsp88 and Hsp30 occurs in the absence of substrate proteins, implying that Hsp88 and Hsp30 may together form a chaperone complex before interacting with substrate proteins. An additional possibility is that the temperature-dependent dissociation of Hsp30 from membranes depends on Hsp88, which is located predominantly in the cytosol. To identify cellular proteins that interact with Hsp30, the small hsp of N. crassa, we analyzed proteins in a cellular extract that were retained by an Hsp30 affinity resin. We found that Hsp70 and Hsp88 specifically bound to immobilized Hsp30. We confirmed the identity of Hsp70 by N-terminal amino acid sequencing. Hsp88 is a previously uncharacterized protein, whose cDNA we isolated and sequenced. Hsp88 appears to be a normal cellular constituent, whose expression increases severalfold in response to high temperature stress. Distantly related to Hsp70, Hsp88 is homologous to several recently characterized proteins, which are also reported to be induced by heat shock. Mammalian Hsp110 is one of the most strongly induced hsps in heat-stressed Chinese hamster ovary cells (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Murine Osp94, in addition to being induced by heat shock, is strongly synthesized in response to hyperosmotic stress (35Kojima R. Randall J. Brenner B.M. Gullans S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12327-12332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These proteins localize chiefly to the cytosol, although Hsp110 is also peripherally associated with nucleoli (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and Hsp105 with nuclei (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). N. crassa Hsp88 is also predominantly cytosolic with a minor portion being membrane-associated. Unlike Hsp70 and small hsps, these proteins do not appear to change their location in response to high temperature (10Lee-Yoon D. Easton D. Murawski M. Burd R. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). There are consistent differences between the Hsp110 family proteins and Hsp70. The two Neurospora proteins have only 18% identity in their C-terminal putative peptide-binding domains, indicating extensive sequence divergence. In contrast their putative ATPase domains have 38% identity, and the recognized ATP-binding motifs are conserved in Hsp88. In our alignment of Hsp88-related and Hsp70 proteins, we found 49 identical and 67 similar residues conserved within the N-terminal domain and only 7 and 9, respectively, within the C-terminal domain. Nevertheless, properties of the N-terminal ATPase domains display surprising contrasts. This domain is more hydrophobic in Hsp88-related proteins than in Hsp70, due particularly to regions within three separate subdomains of the Hsc70 crystal structure, IA, IIA, and IIB (29Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Hsp88/Hsp110 ATPase domain is slightly basic, whereas this domain in Hsp70 is acidic. These properties would be expected to affect binding and hydrolysis of ATP by Hsp88 and related proteins. We found that binding of Hsp88 to ATP-agarose does not occur in the presence of Mg2+ but does occur when Mn2+ is the divalent cation, as has also been reported for purified Hsp90/Hsp83 (34Csermely P. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4943-4950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp105 was also reported not to bind Mg2+ATP-agarose (36Yasuda K. Nakai A. Hatayama T. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29718-29723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Except for Hsp70, other N. crassa proteins in addition to Hsp88, such as Hsp83 and Hsp98, also bind more strongly to Mn2+ATP- than to Mg2+ATP-agarose, with binding to Ca2+ATP-agarose being intermediate. The distinctive properties of the ATPase domain of Hsp88-related proteins are likely to influence the function of these proteins. In S. cerevisiae, the Ssb subgroup of Hsp70 is required for growth at low temperature, and domain swapping experiments showed that the N-terminal ATPase domain of Ssb1 is responsible for conferring this function (37James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domains of the Hsp88-related proteins and Hsp70 include a region of conserved sequence (Hsp88: 551–653) that corresponds to the α-helical region within the peptide-binding domain of E. coli DnaK, an Hsp70 homologue (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The preceding region of β structure in the peptide-binding domain is not conserved in Hsp110 family proteins, although it is more strongly conserved than the α-helical region among Hsp70s (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The β strands comprise the actual peptide-binding subdomain, and the α helices apparently form a lid over the peptide bound within the β sandwich. Movement of the longest α helix relative to the β sandwich, seen in an alternate crystal structure, may reflect nucleotide-induced conformational changes within DnaK (38Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). Sequence conservation of the α subdomain suggests that the Hsp88-related proteins retain the Hsp70 mechanism of nucleotide-regulated peptide-binding and release. The lack of conservation of the β subdomain suggests that the actual peptides bound by these proteins differ. Several interactions between small hsps and purified protein substrates have been reported. For example, the small hsp of avian cells was found to inhibit actin polymerization in vitro (39Miron T. Vancompernolle K. Vandekerckhove J. Wilchek M. Geiger B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Murine Hsp25 (8Ehrnsperger M. Graber S. Gaestel M. Buchner J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar) and pea Hsp18.1 (40Lee G.J. Roseman A.M. Saibil H.R. Vierling E. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar) form complexes with unfolded citrate synthase and other model substrates, and α-crystallin binds to denatured proteins, including β- and γ-crystallins (41Wang K.

https://openalex.org/W2012697137,"The interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase, PKR, inhibits protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2. A kinase insert region N-terminal of PKR kinase subdomain V, which is conserved among eIF2α kinases, has been proposed to determine substrate specificity of these kinases. To investigate the function of this kinase insert region, selective PKR mutants were generated, and kinase activities and eIF2α affinities were analyzedin vitro. The in vivo function was investigated by growth inhibitory assays in yeast and translational assays in COS cells. Among the 13 mutations, 5 lost kinase activity and 3 exhibited less than 30% of wild-type eIF2α binding activity. The deletion of the conserved sequence (amino acids 362–370) resulted in a protein that had no kinase activity and only about 25% of wild-type eIF2α binding, suggesting that this sequence is not only required for PKR kinase activity but also is important for substrate interaction. It was determined that the hydrophobicity of the conserved sequence of PKR is required for kinase activity but is not crucial for eIF2α binding. The amino acid residue Glu-367 in the conserved motif was shown to be directly involved in substrate binding but was not important for kinase activity. These results suggest that the activation of PKR is not a prerequisite for its binding to the substrate and that the conserved motif in subdomain V contributes to the interaction of PKR and eIF2α. The interferon-induced, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase, PKR, inhibits protein synthesis via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF2.

The amino acid residue Glu-367 in the conserved motif was shown to be directly involved in substrate binding but was not important for kinase activity. These results suggest that the activation of PKR is not a prerequisite for its binding to the substrate and that the conserved motif in subdomain V contributes to the interaction of PKR and eIF2α. Protein synthesis is divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The reactions in each phase are promoted by soluble protein factors that transiently interact with the ribosome, mRNA, and aminoacyl-tRNA (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of the α subunit of translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) is a well characterized translational control mechanism. During the first step of translation initiation, a ternary complex eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA is formed and subsequently binds to the 40 S ribosomal subunit of the ribosomes. After one round of initiation, eIF2 is released as an eIF2-GDP complex. To re-form the ternary complex, the GDP bound to eIF2 must be replaced with GTP, and this reaction is catalyzed by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Phosphorylation of eIF2α sequesters the function of eIF2B, thus blocking eIF2 recycling, and results in the inhibition of protein synthesis (1Hershey J.W.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 717-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Three distinct eIF2α kinases have been characterized in eukaryotic cells, including the hemin-regulated inhibitor (HRI, 1The abbreviations used are: HRI, hemin-regulated inhibitor; PKR, dsRNA-activated protein kinase; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; GST, glutathione S-transferase; dsRNA, double-stranded RNA. or HCR), the double-stranded RNA activated protein kinase (PKR), and the yeast kinase GCN2 (general control nondepressible). All three kinases phosphorylate eIF2α at Ser-51 in response to cellular stress conditions (2Colthurst A.R. Cambell D.G. Proud C.G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 166: 357-363Google Scholar, 3Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). HRI mediates protein inhibition in heme-deficient reticulocyte lysate and is also activated by heat shock, sulfhydryl reagents, and heavy metal ions (4London I.M. Levin P.H. Matts R.L. Thomas N.S.B. Petryshyn R. Chen J-J. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 18B. Academic Press, New York1987: 359-380Google Scholar). PKR is up-regulated by interferon and becomes activated upon viral infections that produce dsRNA or single-stranded RNA with double-stranded secondary structure (5McMillan N.J.M. Williams B.R.G. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood, London1996: 225-253Google Scholar). GCN2 is activated by uncharged tRNA under amino acid starvation conditions. Phosphorylation of eIF2α by GCN2 mediates gene-specific translational control of GCN4, a transcriptional activator of amino acid biosynthetic genes in yeast. GCN2 is required for increased translation of GCN4 mRNA in amino acid-starved cells (3Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis shows that PKR, HRI, and GCN2 share sequence and structural features distinct from other eukaryotic protein kinases. Most notable is the presence of an insert sequence located between kinase subdomains IV and V, consisting of 24 amino acid residues for human PKR, 11 amino acid residues for murine PKR, 128 amino acid residues for HRI, and 112 amino acid residues for GCN2 (Fig. 1 A) (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). Although subdomain V is less well conserved among eukaryotic protein kinases (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar), the eIF2 kinases share significant homology in this domain, suggesting that this motif might contain a putative substrate-specific recognition domain (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). PKR is a serine-threonine kinase that mediates the antiviral and antiproliferative effects of interferon through phosphorylation of eIF2α (5McMillan N.J.M. Williams B.R.G. Clemens M.J. Protein Phosphorylation in Cell Growth Regulation. Harwood, London1996: 225-253Google Scholar). Discovered as an enzyme responsible for the inhibition of translation in response to dsRNA in reticulocytes (9Farrell P.J. Balkow K. Hunt T. Jackson R.J. Trachsel H. Cell. 1977; 11: 187-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), PKR has two distinct kinase activities: autophosphorylation, requiring the presence of dsRNA, divalent cations (Mn2+ and Mg2+), and ATP (10Galabru J. Hovanessian A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15538-15544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Berry M.J. Knutson G.S. Lasky S.R. Munemitsu S.M. Samuel C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11240-11247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and phosphorylation of exogenous substrates. This second activity is independent of dsRNA but dependent on ATP and divalent cations (4London I.M. Levin P.H. Matts R.L. Thomas N.S.B. Petryshyn R. Chen J-J. 3rd Ed. The Enzymes. 18B. Academic Press, New York1987: 359-380Google Scholar). As phosphorylation of eIF2α by PKR provides a mechanism for cell defense against virus infection, many viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to inactivate PKR, including degradation of PKR (12Black T.L. Satfer B. Hovanessian A. Katze M.G. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 2244-2251Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), sequestering of dsRNA activator (13Mathews M.B. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 5657-5662Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), binding to PKR to inhibit its activation (14Akkaraju G.R. Whitaker-Dowling P. Youngner J. Jagus R. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10321-10325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or activating a cellular PKR inhibitor (15Lee T.G. Tomita J. Hovanessian A.G. Katze M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6208-6212Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). DNA transfection of certain plasmids can also activate PKR and result in poor translation of plasmid-derived mRNAs. Translation can be restored by coexpression of PKR inhibitors of a mutant form of eIF2α where serine residue 51 has been replaced by alanine (16Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Because of the homology between human and yeast eIF2α, PKR is also able to phosphorylate yeast eIF2α at Ser-51 and inhibit yeast growth (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Human PKR is a 551-amino acid protein consisting of an N-terminal regulatory domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain (17Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The regulatory domain contains two dsRNA binding motifs that are homologous to those in other dsRNA-binding proteins (18St Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Motif I (amino acids 55–75) is essential for dsRNA binding, whereas motif II (amino acids 145–166) plays a less important role (19McCormack S.J. Ortega L.G. Doohan J.P. Samuel C.E. Virology. 1994; 198: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 20Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell.

The catalytic domain contains 11 conserved kinase subdomains characterizing PKR as a serine/threonine kinase (17Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The invariant lysine (Lys-296) in subdomain II is essential for the phosphate transfer reaction. Mutation of this lysine to arginine or proline results in a catalytically inactive protein (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G.

As mentioned above, PKR has a 24-amino acid kinase insert between subdomains IV and V and the highly conserved eIF2α kinase motif LFIQMEFCD in subdomain V. A full-length PKR containing a deletion of six amino acids (LFIQME) at this motif was unable to undergo autophosphorylation or to phosphorylate eIF2 (23Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), underlining the importance of this region to PKR activity. To delineate the individual contribution of conserved individual amino acids in and around the kinase insert region of PKR to eIF2α binding and kinase activity, we generated 13 PKR mutants in this region, analyzed their in vitro auto- and substrate phosphorylation activities and eIF2α affinity, and examined the function of selected mutants in yeast and in mammalian cells. We found that the hydrophobicity of the conserved motif in subdomain V is essential for PKR kinase activity but is not necessarily required for the interaction with eIF2α. We also identified a specific amino acid (Glu-367) that is involved in eIF2α binding but not in PKR auto- and substrate phosphorylation. We conclude that the conserved motif in subdomain V is required for PKR kinase activity and also contributes to its interaction with eIF2α. PKR mutants were generated as described (24McMillan N.A.J. Carpick B.W. Hollis B. Toone W.M. ZamanianDaryoush M. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2601-2606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). PKR cDNA was cloned into the HindIII and PstI sites of pBluescript KS. After mutagenesis, transformants were selected with ampicillin and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The bacterial expression vector pGEX-PKR was constructed by digestion of pBS-PKR with HindIII, end-filling of the PKR fragment, and then ligation into the Escherichia coli expression vector pGEX-1 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) at the SmaI site. The yeast expression vector pYex-PKR was created by inserting the 1.8-kilobase XbaI-PstI PKR cDNA fragment from pBS-PKR into pEMBLyex4 (40Cesareni G. Murray J.A. Stelow J.K. Hollaender A. Genetic Engineering: Principles and Methods. 9. Plenum Press, New York1987: 135-154Google Scholar). The mammalian expression vectors were constructed by insertion of PKR/HindIII fragment from pBS-PKR into pRC/CMV (Invitrogen). The mutant yeast eIF2α expression plasmid (sui2M) was generated by subcloning a 2.7-kilobase eIF2α gene fragment into a 2-micron vector (Yep13) carrying a LEU2 gene (20Romano P.R. Green S.R. Barber G.N. Mathews M.B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 365-378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bacterial expression vector pQE-eIF2α expresses human eIF2α with a hexahistidine containing fusion peptide attached at its C terminus and was kindly provided by Dr. Richard Padgett (Lerner Research Institute). E. coliBL21(DE3)pLysS cells harboring the pGEX-PKR expression vector were grown overnight in 50 ml of Luria-Bertani broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Following 1:10 dilution in fresh medium, cells were grown for 2 h to an optical density of approximately 0.9, induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated for an additional 3–4 h. Bacteria were pelleted and resuspended in modified NETN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were lysed by adding Triton X-100 to 1% (w/v) and sonicating, and the lysate was centrifuged at 27,000 ×g at 4 °C for 20 min. The supernatant was incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia) for 30 min at 4 °C with agitation to isolate the PKR fusion protein. After low speed centrifugation, the bound protein was washed four times with cold modified NETN. Bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml reduced glutathione). The PKR autophosphorylation assay was performed as follows. PKR protein (∼100 ng) was brought up to a volume of 15 μl in buffer DBGA (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 20% glycerol, 7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) before addition of 10 μl of DBGB (DBGA containing 2.5 mm MnCl2) and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (50 Ci/mmol) in a final volume of 30 μl. The reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min before the addition of SDS loading buffer and boiled for 3 min prior to loading on 10% SDS-PAGE gels and autoradiography. For the eIF2α phosphorylation assay, 200 ng of eIF2α was added into the above kinase reaction. To produce recombinant histidine-tagged eIF2α, an overnight culture of pQE-eIF2α containing E. coli M15[pREP4] cells (QIAGEN) was diluted 1:10 in fresh medium and grown for 1 h at 37 °C. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the culture was incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C prior to harvesting by centrifugation. The cells were resuspend in phosphate-buffered saline (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 10 mmNa2HPO4, 1.84 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 10% (v/v) glycerol, lysed by sonication for 3 × 20 s, and centrifuged. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. For the binding assay, purified GST-PKR protein was mixed with 10 μl of bacterial lysate containing eIF2α. Binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% (v/v) glycerol) was added in a total volume of 200 μl. After incubation on ice for 30 min, a further 800 μl of binding buffer was added with 20 μl of a slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (50% (v/v)), and the GST-PKR bound eIF2α pulled down by incubating at 4 °C for 1 h with rotation. The beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer was added, and samples were boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Proteins were identified by Western blotting. Expression plasmids were introduced into the haploid yeast strain, W303-la (MATa, can1–100, his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1, ura3–1, ade2–1) using the lithium acetate procedure (25Becker D.M. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast cells were grown to stationary phase in synthetic medium (26Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar) containing 2% glucose and lacking uracil or leucine. 10 μl of culture was dropped on agar containing medium lacking uracil or leucine with 2% glucose or 2% galactose as carbon sources, and yeast growth on the agar plates was monitored. PKR mutants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV. COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with 400 ng of pRc-PKR and 2 μg of reporter plasmid pGL2-Control (Promega) by the lipofectamine procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and assayed for luciferase activity after normalizing for transfection efficiency by measuring the total protein (27Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25657-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transiently transfected with PKR were harvested 48 h after transfection, and the cells lysed in buffer I (400 mm NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100). PKR was immunoprecipitated from lysate containing 2 mg of total protein using anti-PKR monoclonal antibody (28Laurent A.G. Krust B. Galabru J. Svag J. Hovanessian A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4341-4345Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and detected by Western blot with anti-PKR polyclonal antibody. The eIF2α kinases (HRI, GCN2, and PKR) are distinguished in the family of the serine/threonine protein kinases by possessing a kinase insert between subdomains IV and V. Sequence alignment shows that the amino acid residues flanking the insert regions are highly conserved, including two amino acids in subdomain IV (Tyr-232 and Trp-237 in PKR) and a nine-amino acid motif in subdomain V (LFIQMEFCD) (Fig. 1 A). It has been proposed that these amino acids may contribute to substrate recognition (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 8Schmedt C. Green S.R. Manche L. Taylor D.R. Ma Y. Mathews M.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To investigate the function of these residues, we designed and constructed 13 mutated forms of PKR, including a deletion of the conserved motif (M12), a deletion of the subdomain V together with part of the kinase insert (M13), and single point mutations of different conserved residues (Fig. 1 B). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed in pBluescript, confirmed by sequencing, and the mutated cDNAs were subcloned into expression vectors for in vitro and in vivo functional analysis. Wild-type and PKR mutant cDNAs were expressed inE. coli as GST fusion proteins in the bacterial expression vector pGEX (Fig. 2). The GST fusion proteins were purified by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography, and their expression was monitored by SDS-PAGE with Coomassie Blue staining (data not shown). All mutants were well expressed except M5, which may be intrinsically unstable. The GST fusion proteins showed different mobilities on SDS-PAGE, which were likely due to different phosphorylation levels since recombinant PKR can be partially phosphorylated in bacteria (29Barber G.N. Tomita J. Hovanessian A, G. Meurs E. Katze M.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10356-10361Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To assess the autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activities of PKR mutants, kinase assays were performed using the purified GST-PKR proteins. The levels of GST-PKR proteins used in the kinase assays were determined by Western blot using anti-PKR polyclonal antibody (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). PKR autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 A, middle panel) and phosphorylation of eIF2α (Fig. 2 A, lower panel) were detected by autoradiography. As expected, wild-type PKR showed a high level of autophosphorylation and eIF2α phosphorylation, but no kinase activity was detected for the K296R mutant (Fig. 2 A,middle panel). The two deletion mutants (M12, M13) showed no auto- and substrate phosphorylation activities, whereas the single point mutants showed varying levels of auto- and substrate phosphorylation activities. By comparing the intensities of the phosphorylated protein bands with the PKR concentration, the specific kinase activities for each PKR mutant could be calculated (Fig. 2 C). For most of the mutants, autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation activities were well correlated. An exception to this pattern is mutant M3, which shows autophosphorylation activity but no eIF2α phosphorylation. The single point mutants M3 (L362Q), M4 (I364N), and M8 (F363S), which lost all or most of their kinase activity, contain substitutions of hydrophobic to hydrophilic amino acids within the conserved sequence of subdomain V. To study the interaction of PKR with eIF2α, the bacterially expressed GST-PKR proteins were reacted with histidine-tagged eIF2α. Glutathione-Sepharose beads were used to immobilize the GST-PKR/eIF2α complex, and PKR and eIF2α were detected in Western blots probed with monoclonal antibodies against PKR and eIF2α, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The interaction between PKR and eIF2α was specific because GST alone was not able to bind histidine-tagged eIF2α (Fig. 2 B, lower panel), and wild-type GST-PKR was not able to bind an unrelated histidine-tagged protein His-WT1 (data not shown). All the PKR mutants were able to bind to eIF2α but with different affinities (Fig. 2 B). The relative affinity of different mutants for eIF2α were calculated by counting the ratios of how much eIF2α bound to certain amounts of PKR (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, there was no correlation between the affinity of the PKR mutants for eIF2α and their kinase activities (Fig. 2, C and D). For example, M4 has no kinase activity yet has almost twice the affinity of wild-type PKR for eIF2α. In contrast, mutant M11 has only 20% of wild-type affinity for eIF2α but retains 90% of wild-type kinase activity. Furthermore, M11 can phosphorylate eIF2α very well, suggesting that the high affinity of PKR for eIF2α might not be a prerequisite for PKR function. To analyze the activities of the PKR mutants in vivo, we expressed PKR mutants in yeast cells (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G.

A. 1992; 89: 5447-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). There is 80% homology between yeast and human eIF2α when conservative substitutions are considered (31Cigan A.M. Pabich E.K. Feng L. Donahue T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2784-2788Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and yeast eIF2α can be phosphorylated by human PKR, leading to growth inhibition (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the different PKR mutants were subcloned into the vector pEMBLyex4 and transformed into S. cerevisiae strain W303a. PKR protein expression was controlled via the GAL10-Cyc1 hybrid promoter, whereby growth on galactose as the sole carbon source activates expression. In glucose medium, yeast transformed with M1, M2, M6, M7, or wild-type PKR grew very slowly (Fig. 3 A). This was likely caused by a low basal level expression of PKR. When PKR expression was induced in galactose medium (Fig. 3 B), the growth of yeast transformed with M1, M2, M4, M6, M7, M9, M10, M11, and wild-type PKR was completely inhibited. Significantly, all of these mutants showed kinase activities in vitro except M4 (Fig. 2 A). Because M4 has a high affinity for eIF2α in vitro (Fig. 2), we speculated that the yeast slow growth phenotype might be caused by the direct binding of M4 to eIF2α. To prove this hypothesis, we co-expressed M4 with sui2M, a yeast eIF2α allele that contains a mutation (Ser-51 → Ala) that completely abolishes phosphorylation by PKR. We have previously shown that sui2M is able to rescue the slow growth phenotype when co-expressed with wild-type PKR (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We found that sui2M also reverted the slow-growth phenotype caused by M4 (Fig. 4 B). This suggests that M4 inhibits yeast growth by direct interaction with eIF2α independent of auto- or substrate phosphorylation.Figure 4Reversion of the PKR inhibitory effect on yeast growth by sui2M. The yeast eIF2α mutant sui2M was cloned into the yeast expression vector pYep13 and transformed into yeast strain w303–1a together with PKR expression vector pEMBLyex-PKR. Yeast growth in glucose medium (A) and galactose medium (B) was monitored. 1, wild-type PKR;2, wild-type PKR + Yep13 vector; 3, wild-type PKR + sui2M; 4, M4 only; 5, M4 + Yep13 vector;6, M4 + sui2M; 7, M7 only; 8, M7 + Yep13 vector; 9, M7 + sui2M.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Transient transfection of COS-1 cells with expression plasmids encoding a reporter gene such as DHFR has been shown to result in inefficient translation due to PKR activation and eIF2α phosphorylation (16Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A variety of agents can stimulate the synthesis of the reporter protein, including vaccinia virus gene products E3L and K3L, the catalytically inactive PKR mutant K296R, and the dsRNA binding-deficient mutant K64E (32Davies M.V. Chang H.W. Jacobs B.L. Kaufman R.J. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 1688-1692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Wu S. Kaufman R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1756-1763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The luciferase reporter plasmid pGL2-control was also successfully used in this system (27Patel R.C. Stanton P. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25657-25663Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Therefore, we used the COS-1 expression system to analyze the function of some of our PKR mutants in mammalian cells. Three PKR mutants (M3, M4, M11) together with wild-type PKR and the K296R mutant were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV and transiently transfected into COS-1 cells together with the luciferase reporter vector. Transfection of wild-type PKR almost completely inhibited luciferase translation, whereas the K296R mutant had a dominant-negative effect, resulting in enhanced luciferase activity (Fig. 5 A). Mutant M3, which has very little autophosphorylation activity and no eIF2α phosphorylation activity in vitro, was not able to inhibit translation in COS cells, consistent with its function in yeast. However, mutant M4, which inhibited yeast growth, also enhanced luciferase activity, suggesting that it is inactive in COS cells. As with wild-type PKR, mutant M11 inhibited luciferase gene translation, consistent with its function in yeast. As shown previously, although M11 has a low eIF2α affinity for eIF2α, it can phosphorylate eIF2α almost as well as wild-type PKR in vitro (Fig. 2).In vivo experiments demonstrate that M11 is fully functional in both yeast and COS cells. PKR has been shown to be autoregulatory in transfected COS cells (16Kaufman R.J. Davies M.V. Pathak V.K. Hershey J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 946-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar,34Thomis D.C. Samuel C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10837-10841Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we analyzed the expression of PKR and its mutants in transfected COS cells. PKR was immunoprecipitated from transfected cell lysate by anti-PKR monoclonal antibody and detected by Western blot with polyclonal antibody. Consistent with their kinase activitiesin vitro, wild-type PKR and mutant M11 were expressed at low levels in the transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, lanes 3and 7), whereas K296R mutant and M3 were expressed very well (Fig. 5 B, lanes 4 and 5). Mutant M4 was expressed better than wild-type PKR (Fig. 5 B, lane 6), whereas in another experiment, its expression was close to that of the K296R mutant (data not shown). Thus, the lack of inhibitory function of M4 in the COS cell assay is due to the loss of kinase activity rather than deficient protein expression. The anti-viral effect of PKR is an important mechanism for host defense against viral infection and is mediated through the phosphorylation of eIF2α and inhibition of viral protein synthesis. In addition, PKR has been shown to have an antiproliferative function and to regulate cell growth (7Chong K.L. Feng L. Schappert K. Meurs E. Donahue T.F. Friesen J.D. Hovanessian A.G. Williams B.R.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1553-1562Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 23Koromilas A.E. Roy S. Barber G.N. Katze M.G. Sonenberg N. Science. 1992; 257: 1685-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 35Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), which is at least in part linked to eIF2α phosphorylation. In this study, we have examined the effects of mutations of the conserved amino acids around the PKR kinase insert region in vitro and in vivo. By using bacterially expressed PKR and eIF2α, we were able to study their direct interaction in vitro. We found that amino acids in the conserved sequence LFIQMEFCD (amino acids 362–370) in subdomain V are important for PKR kinase activity, as the single point mutations L362Q (M3), I364N (M4), and F363S (M8) resulted in a loss of both kinase activity in vitro and growth and translation suppression function in vivo. However, these amino acids may not be directly involved in substrate recognition because all mutants were able to bind to eIF2α, including the two deletion mutants, although some mutants bound eIF2α at a relatively low level compared with wild-type PKR. For example, M11 (E367R), which has kinase activity and is fully functional in vivo, showed only about 20% of normal (wild-type) eIF2α binding activity. Because of the homologous nature of protein kinase domains, they all fold into topologically similar three-dimensional core structures and carry out phosphotransfer by a common mechanism (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of more than ten eukaryotic protein kinases have been reported, and their kinase domains all fold into a two-lobed structure (6Hanks S.K. Hunter T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2290) Google Scholar). The smaller lobe contains subdomains I–IV, and the larger lobe includes subdomains VI–XI. Subdomain V residues link the two lobes. The catalytic domain of PKR may also have the same general structure. According to sequence alignment with PKA-Cα, the N-terminal part of the conserved motif (LFIQM) in PKR kinase subdomain V is predicted to form a very hydrophobic β-strand (β5) in the small lobe (Fig. 1 A), and the hydrophobicity of these residues may be important for the maintenance of the two-lobed structure. This prediction is supported by our results showing that the deletion of this region (M12, M13) along with single point mutations that replace hydrophobic with hydrophilic residues (M3-L362Q, M4-I364N, M8-F363S) result in a loss of kinase activity. The C-terminal amino acids of the conserved motif (EFCD) form part of the extended chain that connects the two lobes. In PKA, Glu-127 on the extended chain participates in peptide binding by forming an ion pair with an arginine in the pseudosubstrate site of the PKA inhibitor peptide (39Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Ten Eyck L.F. Zhong N-H. Taylor S.S. Sowadsk J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation site in eIF2α also contains basic residues C-terminal to the serine phosphorylation site (Glu-Leu-Ser(P)-Arg-Arg) (2Colthurst A.R. Cambell D.G. Proud C.G. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1987; 166: 357-363Google Scholar). PKR has no residues corresponding to PKA Glu-127 but has two acidic amino acids a few residues upstream, Glu-367 and Asp-370 (Fig. 1). However, the single point mutants M10 (E367Q) and M11 (E367R) have nearly full kinase activity, suggesting that Glu-367 has little effect on kinase structure. Nevertheless, in GST-pull down assays, M10 exhibits 50% eIF2α binding compared with wild-type PKR, and M11 has only 20% eIF2α binding activity, suggesting that Glu-367 may be involved in substrate anchoring through an ion pair with a basic residue in the substrate, possibly an arginine. This residue may not be crucial for substrate recognition, however, because the PKR mutants are still able to bind eIF2α, and more important, they are fully functional in vivo (Figs. 3 and 5). Asp-370 may also contribute to eIF2α binding, but this remains to be tested by mutagenesis. We have found that there is a contradiction in M4 function in yeast and in COS-1 cells. M4 is able to inhibit yeast growth but does not inhibit translation in COS-1 cells. The mechanism by which M4 inhibits yeast growth is unclear, although our data suggest that it may result from an interaction with yeast eIF2α. In yeast, the level of phosphorylation of eIF2 by GCN2 during amino acid starvation is regulated precisely to lower the efficiency of reinitiation without affecting primary translation (35Wek R.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 491-496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). It has been shown that low level expression of the mammalian kinases (PKR or HRI) or activation of GCN2 under amino acid starvation conditions leads to increased GCN4 expression, whereas yeast cells continue to grow and divide (36Dever T.E. Chen J.J. Barber G.N. Cigan A.M. Feng L. Donahue T.F. London I.M. Katze M.G. Hinnebusch A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4616-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In contrast, high level expression of the mammalian kinases or genetic activation of GCN2 severely reduces the growth rate of yeast cells (37Ramirez M. Wek R.C. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Jackson B.M. Freeman B. Hinnebusch A.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5801-5815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Dever T.E. Feng L. Wek R.C. Cigan A.M. Donahue T.F. Hinnebusch A.G. Cell. 1992; 68: 585-596Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). In our yeast system, GCN4 expression or low level eIF2α phosphorylation may be required for yeast growth because we used synthetic medium with only essential amino acids, requiring that the yeast synthesize nonessential amino acids. When M4 overexpression is induced by galactose, it might sequester eIF2α from phosphorylation by GCN2 due to its high affinity for eIF2α, thus blocking the induction of GCN4 expression and inhibiting yeast growth. The reversal of this effect by the eIF2α mutant sui2M could then be explained by competition with endogenous eIF2α for binding to M4, freeing eIF2α to release the suppression of GCN4 expression. The mechanism of action of M4 in COS-1 cells is likely independent of eIF2α binding and may involve the formation of inactive heterodimers with endogenous PKR. Finally, our data show that phosphorylation of PKR is not required for binding to its substrate, eIF2α. The catalytically inactive mutant K296R has no kinase activity but is able to bind eIF2α. Moreover, mutant M4 can bind eIF2α more readily than wild-type PKR. This increased affinity of M4 for eIF2α may result from a conformational change due to the replacement of the hydrophobic isoleucine residue with a hydrophilic asparagine. In any case, high affinity of the PKR mutants for eIF2α is not required for kinase function. M11 has only 20% of eIF2α binding activity versus wild-type PKR but is fully functional in vitro and in vivo. Mutant M1 has less than half of the normal eIF2α binding activity but has a higher kinase activity in vitro than wild-type PKR (Fig. 2). The identification of the exact eIF2α recognition sites within PKR requires further experimentation. However, as the substrate binding sites may not be contiguous in primary sequence but scattered through the catalytic domain and close in the ternary structure, it will be essential to solve the structure of PKR to address this question directly."
https://openalex.org/W1972237730,"Vertebrate Hox and Otx genes encode homeodomain-containing transcription factors thought to transduce positional information along the body axis in the segmental portion of the trunk and in the rostral brain, respectively. Moreover, Hox and Otx2 genes show a complementary spatial regulation during embryogenesis. In this report, we show that a 1821-base pair (bp) upstream DNA fragment of the Otx2 gene is positively regulated by co-transfection with expression vectors for the human HOXB1, HOXB2, and HOXB3 proteins in an embryonal carcinoma cell line (NT2/D1) and that a shorter fragment of only 534 bp is able to drive this regulation. We also identified the HOXB1, HOXB2, and HOXB3 DNA-binding region on the 534-bp Otx2 genomic fragment using nuclear extracts from Hox-transfected COS cells and 12.5 days postcoitum mouse embryos or HOXB3 homeodomain-containing bacterial extracts. HOXB1, HOXB3, and nuclear extracts from 12.5 days postcoitum mouse embryos bind to a sequence containing two palindromic TAATTA sites, which bear four copies of the ATTA core sequence, a common feature of most HOM-C/HOX binding sites. HOXB2 protected an adjacent site containing a direct repeat of an ACTT sequence, quite divergent from the ATTA consensus. The region bound by the three homeoproteins is strikingly conserved through evolution and necessary (at least for HOXB1 and HOXB3) to mediate the up-regulation of the Otx2 transcription. Taken together, our data support the hypothesis that anteriorly expressed Hox genes might play a role in the refinement of the Otx2 early expression boundaries in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2144474273,"We have characterized a group of cis-regulatory elements that control muscle-specific expression of the rat skeletal muscle type 1 sodium channel (SkM1) gene. These elements are located within a 3.1-kilobase fragment that encompasses the 5′-flanking region, first exon, and part of the first intron of SkM1. We sequenced the region between −1062 and +311 and determined the start sites of transcription; multiple sites were identified between +1 and +30. The basal promoter (−65/+11) lacks cell-type specificity, while an upstream repressor (−174/−65) confers muscle-specific expression. A positive element (+49/+254) increases muscle-specific expression. Within these broad elements, two E boxes play a pivotal role. One E box at −31/−26 within the promoter, acting in part through its ability to bind the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins, recruits additional factor(s) that bind elsewhere within the SkM1 sequence to control positive expression of the gene. A second E box at −90/−85 within the repressor controls negative regulation of the gene and acts through a different complex of proteins. Several of these cis-regulatory elements share both sequence and functional similarities with cis-regulatory elements of the acetylcholine receptor δ-subunit; the different arrangement of these elements may contribute to unique expression patterns for the two genes.

Sodium channels comprise a multigene family, the members of which are expressed in a tissue-specific and developmentally-regulated manner. The electrophysiological properties of the different channel isoforms differ subtly, and presumably reflect the underlying need for slight variations in electrical conduction in the different tissues. Several members of the sodium channel family have been implicated in various inherited disorders in muscle, heart, and neuronal tissues (1Barchi R.L. Neurobiol.

In this report, we characterize several of the cis-regulatory elements that control transcription of the skeletal muscle type 1 sodium channel (SkM1). The two isoforms of skeletal muscle sodium channel, SkM1 and SkM2, are regulated differentially during development. SkM2 is expressed in embryonic muscle but is down-regulated postnatally; denervation of adult muscle leads to the reactivation of SkM2 transcription (8Kallen R.G. Sheng Z.-H. Yang J. Chen L. Rogart R.B. Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1990; 4: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Yang J.S. Sladky J.T. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1991; 7: 412-427Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SkM1 comprises most of the sodium channel expressed in adult skeletal muscle, with the mRNA levels up-regulating 10-fold postnatally (8Kallen R.G. Sheng Z.-H. Yang J. Chen L. Rogart R.B. Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1990; 4: 233-242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 9Yang J.S. Sladky J.T. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L.

Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 915-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Since the SkM1 isoform is expressed in skeletal muscle, it seemed likely that it is regulated in part by muscle-specific transcription factors from the MyoD and MEF2 families (see Refs. 12Buonanno A. Rosenthal N. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 95-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 13Molkentin J.D. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unlike most skeletal muscle genes, which are expressed at highest levels before birth, SkM1 reaches peak expression in adult muscle. Only a few other muscle genes, such as myoglobin, exhibit this late rise in expression levels (15Garry D.J. Bassel-Duby R.S. Richardson J.A. Grayson J. Neufer P.D. Williams R.S. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 146-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and novel factors may be involved in the regulation of such genes (16Bassel-Duby R.S. Hernandez M.D. Gonzalez M.A. Krueger J.K.

Biol. 1994; 14: 4596-4605Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition, like the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), the sodium channel is expressed at higher levels beneath the neuromuscular junction than in the surrounding sarcolemma (18Haimovich B. Schotland D.L. Fieles W.E. Barchi R.L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2957-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Lupa M.T. Krzemien D.M. Schaller K.L. Caldwell J.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); comparison of the SkM1 regulatory sequences to those for the AChR subunits may reveal common regulatory pathways. We anticipate that the expression of the SkM1 gene is regulated by a complex combination of tissue- and developmental-specific factors working in conjunction with the general transcription apparatus. As a first step toward elucidating the regulation of this gene, we have carried out a detailed analysis of the cis-regulatory elements that control its expression, elucidated similarities between some of these elements and those of the AChR δ-subunit, and studied in more detail the critical role played by two E boxes. One E box, located within the promoter of the gene, plays a critical role in positive, tissue-specific gene expression. We demonstrate that members of the MyoD family of transcription factors contribute to this positive regulation, although they are not wholly responsible for it. The second E box plays a critical role in the repression of SkM1 expression in non-muscle cells through binding a complex of proteins. A rat spleen genomic library in λDASH was screened using probes derived from the 5′-untranslated region of the SkM1 gene (20Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomilo S.A. Zhou J. Crean S.M. Boyle M.B. Kallen R.G. Sheng Z Barchi R.L. Sigworth F.J. Goodman R.H. Agnew W.S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), and five overlapping clones were obtained. Clones λ14.2, λ29.1, and λ22.1A were positive in a Southern blot to a PstI fragment encoding sequences −310 to +119 relative to the published translation start site of the SkM1 gene (20Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomilo S.A. Zhou J. Crean S.M. Boyle M.B. Kallen R.G. Sheng Z Barchi R.L. Sigworth F.J. Goodman R.H. Agnew W.S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of λ14.2, reported previously (21George A.L. Iyer G.S. Kleinfield R. Kallen R.G. Barchi R.L. Genomics. 1993; 15: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), encodes the −401 to −226 segment but then deviates from that of the cDNA clone (20Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomilo S.A. Zhou J. Crean S.M. Boyle M.B. Kallen R.G. Sheng Z Barchi R.L. Sigworth F.J. Goodman R.H. Agnew W.S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar), revealing the presence of an intron between −402 and −401. The library was screened using sequences −451 to −402 as a probe, and two clones, designated λ2633 and λ2A.1.1, were obtained. A restriction site map was derived using the enzymesHindIII, EcoRI, BamHI, andKpnI, indicating that the five clones encompass almost 40 kb of DNA surrounding the transcription initiation site of the SkM1 gene. A 3.1-kb HindIII fragment obtained from clone λ2A.1.1 that was positive in a Southern blot with the −451 to −402 probe was cloned into pBluescript (KS) (SkM1-3.1) and used for all subsequent analysis. DNA sequencing (Sequenase; U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was carried out on the SkM1-3.1 clone from the 3′ edge using T7 and a series of primers to the SkM1 sequence. Using the resulting sequence, additional primers were synthesized and sequencing performed on the complementary strand. Three clones containing sequence between −1062 (BglII) and −438 (SphI), −438 (SphI) and +11 (SacI), and +11 (SacI), and +254 (XbaI) were cloned into pAlter (Promega) and single strand DNA generated. This DNA was both sequenced and used for generation of site-directed mutations. RNase protections were carried out as described (4Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), using a [32P]UTP-labeled antisense RNA probe containing sequences −640 to +127 hybridized to 50 μg of total RNA obtained from rat skeletal muscle or liver. For 5′-RACE, poly(A)+ mRNA was purified from rat skeletal muscle, and cDNA synthesized using a primer containing the −325 to −349 segment relative to the translational start site. A poly(G) tail was added to the cDNA by incubating in 25 units of terminal transferase, 40 μm dGTP, 0.72 mmCoCl2, and the buffer supplied by the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim) for 15 min at 37 °C. PCR was performed using this template, an oligo(C) anchor primer (CACTGCAGAAGCTTGGATCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC), and a primer complementary to sequence contained in the second exon of the SkM1 gene (−357/−380). For cloning purposes, the PCR primers were synthesized with restriction sites (HindIII for the anchor primer and XbaI for the SkM1 primer). The PCR products were cloned into pBluescript (SK) (Stratagene) using the HindIII and XbaI sites and 21 individual clones sequenced. The first transcription initiation site observed by 5′-RACE was numbered +1 and all other sites are numbered relative to it (Fig. 2 A). Unless otherwise indicated, numbering is shown relative to the start site of transcription. The SkM1-3.1 clone was digested with HindIII (−2.8) and XbaI (+49) and the resulting fragment was ligated into pCAT-Basic (Promega) digested with HindIII and XbaI using a linker (XbaI-XhoI-XbaI). This clone was designated SkM1CAT (−2800 to +49). 5′ deletion mutants −1062 and +11 were created from SkM1CAT using naturally occurring restriction sites at −1062 (BglII) and +11 (SacI) and linkers (HindIII-BglII;HindIII-SacI). The 5′ deletion mutant −438 (SphI) was created by inserting the SphI toXbaI fragment from SkM1CAT into pCAT-Basic cut with the same enzymes. The 3′ deletion extending from −2.8 (HindIII) to −438 (SphI) was created by inserting this fragment into pCAT-Basic cut with HindIII and SphI and the 3′ deletion mutant ending at +11 (SacI) was created by digesting SkM1CAT with SacI and XbaI and ligating using a linker (SacI-XbaI). The 5′ deletion mutants −273, −174, −135, −95, −85, and −65 were created by PCR. The 5′ primers contained 20 bp of SkM1 sequence starting at the designated point and a restriction site for enzyme indicated below for cloning purposes; the 3′ primer was complementary to +56 to +78. The PCR products were digested with PstI and XbaI (−273 and −174), SalI and XbaI (−65), orHindIII and XbaI (−135, −95, and −85), and cloned into pCAT-Basic digested with the same enzymes. All mutants generated by PCR were sequenced. To generate the constructs XmaS and XmaG, the XmaI fragment encoding sequences +50 to +254 was cloned into the XmaI site of the SkM1CAT vector and clones corresponding to the native (XmaS) and reverse (XmaG) orientation were selected. The repressor constructs on the heterologous rat brain type II sodium channel promoter, containing sequences between −130 and +177 (RBII), were generated by introducing HindIII-BglII fragments generated by PCR (for −174/−50 and −174/−65) or double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides (−135/−95, −135/−82, and −93/−82) into the gel-purified pSDK7 vector (5Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.-J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), cut withHindIII and BglII. The wild-type SkM1 promoter E box (wt −34/−23) and mutants (c/g, g/a, t/a, g/t, and tcc/gaa −34/−23) were generated by introducing double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotides containing flanking HindIII sites into theHindIII site of pCAT-Basic. All constructs were sequenced. Linker-scanning mutations of the promoter were created by site-directed mutagenesis using the Alter Sites II kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's directions. The entire region between −57 (HinfI) and +11 (SacI) was sequenced and introduced back into the SkM1 sequence of either the construct XmaS or the core promoter (−65 to +49) at those restriction sites. Culture of primary muscle cells and NIH 3T3 cells was carried out as described (5Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.-J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,11Yang J.S. Bennett P.B. Makita N. George A.L. Barchi R.L. Neuron. 1993; 11: 915-922Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected by CaPO4 precipitation as described (22Chahine M. George A.L. Zhou M. Ji S. Sun W. Barchi R.L. Horn R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 281-294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) using either 8.5 pmol of SkM1 reporter gene constructs (25–41 μg of DNA), 5 μg of pCAT-Control as a positive control, or 24.4 μg (8.5 pmol) of pCAT-Basic as a negative control. Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase was co-transfected as a control for transfection efficiency. Primary muscle cultures were transfected on culture day 2 and harvested on culture days 6 or 7, following robust formation of myotubes. NIH 3T3 cells were split to 40% confluence prior to transfection and harvested 2 days following transfection. Cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity as described (18Haimovich B. Schotland D.L. Fieles W.E. Barchi R.L. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2957-2966Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); samples were also assayed for β-galactosidase activity (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol was quantitated using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The β-galactosidase assays were used to normalize the samples within an individual set of transfected cells; for comparison between transfections or cell types, CAT activity was expressed relative to pCAT-Control or the RBII promoter (5Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.-J. Mandel G. Neuron. 1992; 9: 37-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from muscle or 3T3 cells by the method of Dignam et al. (24Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). The 32P-labeled −174/−65 and −135/−82 repressor probes and wild-type and mutant −34/−23 promoter probes were purified from a nondenaturing acrylamide gel. Double-stranded competitor DNAs were generated by annealing the wild-type or mutant synthetic oligonucleotides. Gel shifts and DNase footprints were carried out as described previously (19Lupa M.T. Krzemien D.M. Schaller K.L. Caldwell J.H. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1326-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The binding buffer for the repressor probes was 4 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1% glycerol, 1% Ficoll, 20 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.1 mmdithiothreitol, and the gel was run in a low ionic strength buffer (6.4 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, and 1 mm EDTA) at room temperature. The binding buffer and conditions described by Simon and Burden (25Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for gel shifts involving myogenic factors, except that 10 μg of protein was used. Supershift assays were carried out as described previously (25Simon A.M. Burden S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5133-5140Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using commercially available antibodies to MyoD (Vector) and myogenin (Dako). Five SkM1 genomic clones were obtained from a rat spleen genomic library, and the overlaps determined by restriction mapping (Fig. 1). A 3.1-kbHindIII fragment derived from λ2A.1.1 was positive in a Southern blot using a probe to sequences −451 to −402 relative to the translational start site (20Trimmer J.S. Cooperman S.S. Tomilo S.A. Zhou J. Crean S.M. Boyle M.B. Kallen R.G. Sheng Z Barchi R.L. Sigworth F.J. Goodman R.H. Agnew W.S. Mandel G. Neuron. 1989; 3: 33-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). This fragment was cloned into Bluescript KSII, and used as the starting material for all subsequent analysis. Sequence analysis between −1062 and +311 revealed that this fragment contains 225 bp of the first intron, the first exon (87 bp), and approximately 2.8 kb of 5′-flanking sequence (Fig. 2 A). Transcriptional start site analysis was carried out by both nuclease protection and 5′-RACE. RNase protection assays were performed with an32P-labeled antisense RNA probe containing sequences −640 to +127 hybridized to total RNA prepared from both adult rat skeletal muscle and liver. Protected fragments ranged in size from 87 to 70 bp (Fig. 3), indicating multiple transcriptional start sites. 5′-RACE was used to confirm the transcriptional start sites. Of 21 clones sequenced, 16 encoded the SkM1 5′-untranslated region and 11 of these initiated between +1 and +29, in good agreement with the distribution pattern observed by the RNase protection assay. The five remaining clones initiated between +40 and +78, and may represent transcripts that terminated prematurely. The sequence of 5 clones obtained with 5′-RACE is shown (Fig. 3). We numbered the first transcription initiation site observed by 5′-RACE as +1 and all other sites are numbered relative to it, as is shown in the sequence (Fig. 2 A). Inspection of the sequence just upstream of the transcriptional start sites indicates that the SkM1 promoter region lacks canonical TATA boxes, CAAT boxes, or binding sites for SP-1, and also lacks conserved initiator sequence surrounding the transcription start sites (26Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). There is a CG-rich sequence just upstream of the transcription initiation sites that includes a consensus binding site for the AP-2 transcription factor (GCCN3GGC) as well as an E box (CANNTG), the consensus binding site for the bHLH family of transcription factors that includes the MyoD family. The general structure of the SkM1 promoter is similar to that of the rat brain type II sodium channel promoter, which also lacks common promoter motifs and has an E box in its promoter region (4Maue R.A. Kraner S.D. Goodman R.H. Mandel G. Neuron. 1990; 4: 223-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In addition, there are several similar motifs in common between the 5′-flanking sequence of the AChR δ-subunit gene and the SkM1 gene, as is highlighted in the sequence comparison (Fig. 2 B). The E box in the SkM1 promoter at −31/−26 and the surrounding sequence are similar to the δ-subunit promoter and both are located at similar sites relative to the first transcriptional start site. The SkM1 sequence contains two E boxes (at −90/−85 and −31/−26), whereas the δ-subunit sequence contains only one (at −22/−16). However, the sequence of the E box at −90/−85 in the SkM1 sequence is identical to the E box in the promoter of the δ-subunit gene. As described below, the E box in the δ-subunit promoter may control two functions that are split between the two separate E boxes of the SkM1 gene. The second set of similar motifs occurs at −85 to −60 in the SkM1 sequence. We created a series of deletion mutants of the SkM1 genomic sequence linked to the reporter gene for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) and transfected these mutants into either rat primary muscle cultures, which express the SkM1 gene, or NIH 3T3 cells, which do not express the gene. The series of 5′ deletion mutants shown in Fig. 4 A terminate at +49. The longest construction of this group, beginning approximately −2800 bp upstream of the transcription start sites, and 5′ deletion mutants to −174, produced approximately 10-fold higher CAT levels in rat primary muscle cells than in NIH 3T3 cells, demonstrating the ability of the 5′-flanking region to drive muscle-specific expression. Deletion of sequences from −174 to −65 resulted in a 10-fold up-regulation in the 3T3 cell line, with only a 2-fold increase in primary muscle cells. Further deletion to +11, which falls within the cluster of transcription start sites, reduced expression in both lines to levels only 2–3-fold that of the pCAT-Basic vector itself. A 3′ deletion mutant that includes sequence between −2800 to +11 exhibited expression levels in primary muscle cells similar to that of the mutation that ends at +49, whereas further 3′ deletion to −438 abolished expression in primary muscle cells. Thus, the rough boundaries of the SkM1 “core” promoter fall between nucleotides −65 and +11, although for convenience, our core promoter constructs extend from −65 to +49. This core promoter is not muscle-specific; the repressor element located between −174 and −65 confers muscle-specific expression on the SkM1 promoter. The addition of nucleotides between +50 and +254 to the −2800/+49 sequence increased expression in primary muscle cells, 10-fold, to achieve a final level 50-fold higher than in 3T3 cells (Fig. 4 B). This increase in gene expression is partly dependent on orientation, since placement of the +50/+254 fragment in a reverse orientation reduced the effect by 50%. This fragment did not function in an enhancer trap assay with either the heterologous SV-40 promoter or its native SkM1 promoter (data not shown) and is, therefore, a position-dependent positive element. We refer to the genomic sequences spanning nucleotides −2800 to +254 as the full-length SkM1 regulatory sequence. Within this region, we have initially defined three broad elements important for the expression of the SkM1 gene: 1) the core promoter, which lies between −65 and +11 and lacks muscle-specificity; 2) a repressor, which lies between −174 and −65 and confers muscle-specificity on the promoter; and 3) a muscle-specific positive element which lies between +50 and +254. Because the repressor located between −174 and −65 confers muscle-specific gene expression, we investigated this element in greater detail. A 32P-labeled −174/−65 probe was analyzed in a gel shift assay using nuclear extracts prepared either from primary muscle cells at various stages of development or from NIH 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 A). As an independent control for the quality of the nuclear extracts, a32P-labeled SP-1 recognition site synthetic oligonucleotide was tested with the same extracts. A prominent shift, designated as the upper band (UB), was detected at the same mobility in primary muscle cells at all stages of development and in 3T3 cells. Although the intensity of the upper band was greater in 3T3 cells than primary muscle cells, the presence of a shift in the primary muscle cultures once myotubes had fully formed (day 7) seemed at odds with the activity profile in the two cell types shown in Fig. 4 A. However, as shown below, this factor is not only present in both cell types, but also functional in both. To further delineate the boundaries of the protein binding region, we performed DNase footprint assays using extracts from both day 7 primary muscle and 3T3 cells (Fig. 5 B). The footprints in the two cell types had in common a series of hypersensitive sites and a protected region extending from −135 to −82 that may indicate the binding of a factor common to both cell types. In the primary muscle cells, there was also additional protection both within the −135 to −82 region and upstream to −65, indicating either that an additional factor binds the DNA in the primary muscle cells or that a different factor binds. The combination of the gel shift and footprint analysis suggested that repressor-binding protein(s) are present in both cell types, but that the identity of the protein or protein complex may not be the same. The footprinted −135/−82 region produced the same gel shift pattern as observed for the −174/−65 repressor, although two lower bands (labeled LB) are more easily visualized when using the smaller probe (Fig. 5 C). These shifts were also observed with the −174/−65 probe, but were partly obscured by the unbound probe. A −93/−82 fragment encompassing only the −90/−85 E box failed to produce a gel shift (data not shown), but when present at micromolar concentrations, this E box displaced the probe from the upper band in a competition assay, demonstrating that the relevant factor binds to the E box, although with a lower affinity than for the larger fragment. Extending the results of the footprint analysis, we constructed a series of mutations in which the −174/−65 repressor element or various permutations of this sequence were transferred to a heterologous promoter. We chose a minimal rat brain type II sodium channel promoter containing sequences −130 to +177 (RBII) because it is expressed strongly in many cell types and has structural similarities to the SkM1 promoter. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the −174/−65 fragment, a slightly longer −174/−50 fragment, and the footprinted region of −135/−82 all reduced expression of the rat brain promoter to approximately 20% of its normal levels in both cell types, while a fragment extending from −135 to −95 only reduced expression to 70% of control. When a −93/−82 fragment, containing the E box at −90/−85, was transferred to the heterologous promoter, the level of expression was also 20% of control levels. Thus, the sequence encoding the E box conferred the same level of repression as observed for the full −174/−65 repressor. Deletions on the native promoter confirmed the importance of the E box between −95 and −85 in the function of the SkM1 repressor (Fig. 6B). While deletions to −135 and −95 had only small effects, deletions that included the E box produced a much higher expression level in primary muscle than 3T3 cells. Further deletion to −65 greatly reduced this muscle-specific expression, indicating the presence of a positive element adjacent to the repressor. As noted above, there are two motifs within this region, AGATTG at −83/−78 and GTTTC at −64/−60, that are conserved exactly between the SkM1 gene and a region of the AChR δ-subunit gene that acts as an enhancer (25Simon A.M.

By amino-terminal deletion analysis and by site-directed mutagenesis we have identified a new domain within the amino-terminal α-helix that is essential for dimerization of VEGF. VEGF121 variants containing amino acids 8 to 121 or 14 to 121, respectively, either expressed in Escherichia coli and refolded in vitro, or expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, were in a dimeric conformation and showed full binding activity to VEGF receptors and stimulation of endothelial cell proliferation as compared with wild-type VEGF. In contrast, a VEGF121 variant covering amino acids 18 to 121, as well as a variant in which the hydrophobic amino acids Val14, Val15, Phe17, and Met18 within the amphipathic α-helix near the amino terminus were replaced by serine, failed to form biological active VEGF dimers. From these data we conclude that a domain between amino acids His12 and Asp19 within the amino-terminal α-helix is essential for formation of VEGF dimers, and we propose hydrophobic interactions between VEGF monomers to stabilize or favor dimerization.

Alignment of VEGF121 and PDGF-B/v-sis amino acid sequences showed a 25% identity of the region Cys26 to Cys104 of VEGF and Cys16 to Cys99of mature PDGF-B. This region of PDGF-B/v-sis, the minimal v-sis transforming domain, was described to retain biological activity of the growth factor (22Hannink M. Donoghue D.J.

In case of VEGF, it had previously been shown that a plasmin digested 110-amino acid amino-terminal fragment, which was cleaved between Arg110and Ala111, retains full biological activity as compared with the VEGF121 isoform (24Keyt B.A. Berleau L.T.

To analyze the contribution of amino acids Ala1 to Tyr25, which are located amino-terminal with respect to the homology region of VEGF to the minimal v-sis transforming domain, to structure and/or biological activity of VEGF, we generated amino-terminal truncated VEGF121 variants. Here were show that an amino-terminal domain between amino acids His12 and Asp19 is essential for in vitro dimerization of VEGF and for functional expression of VEGF in vivo. As the conversion of hydrophobic amino acids within this domain to serine impairs formation of VEGF dimers we propose hydrophobic interactions between VEGF monomers to stabilize or favor formation of dimers. cDNAs encoding amino-terminal truncated VEGF proteins were generated by PCR technique using the 5′-primers VEGF-8 (5′-GAGCCATGGAGAATCATCACGAAGTGGTGAAG-3′), VEGF-14 (5′-CACGCCATGGTGAAGTTCATGGATGTCT-3′), and VEGF-18 (5′-AAGTCCATGGATGTCTATCAGCGCAGC-3′), respectively, the 3′-primer VEGF-Bam (5′-AGTGGATCCCCCCCTGGTGA-3′), and cloned human VEGF121 cDNA (25Weindel K.

Mutant VEGF-V14S/V15S/F17S/M18S was generated by PCR using 5′-primer 207 (5′-TCGGGCCTCCGAAACCATGA-3′) and 3′-primer VEGF-N1 (5′-GGCTCCTGAAGCTGCTAAGCACTACTAAGACGGGAGG-3′) for amplification of the 5′-fragment and 5′-primer VEGF-N2 (5′-AATCGTCGAAGTCCTCGGATGTCTATCAGCGCAGCTA-3′) and 3′-primer VEGF-Bam for amplification of the 3′-fragment. The fragments were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and used in an equimolar ratio as template for fusion-PCR using 5′-primer 207 and 3′-primer VEGF-Bam.

The resulting PCR fragment containing mutant VEGF sequence and vector sequence was phosphorylated by T4 polynucelotide kinase (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany), gel purified, religated, and transformed into Escherichia coli XL1-blue. The mutant VEGF cDNAs were cloned into the His-pET vector (26Siemeister G. Schnurr B. Mohrs K. Schächtele C. Marmé D. Martiny-Baron G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Solubilization of VEGF proteins from inclusion bodies, refolding, and purification was performed essentially as described for wild-type VEGF121 (26Siemeister G. Schnurr B. Mohrs K. Schächtele C.

For the construction of eukaryotic expression plasmids NcoI/BamHI fragments encoding mutant VEGF variants were fused to the VEGF signal sequence by substitution of the NcoI/BamHI restriction fragment of wild-type VEGF121 in a plasmid, which contains the entire VEGF121 coding region cloned into theSmaI site of pBluescript (25Weindel K. Marmé D. Weich H.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 183: 1167-1174Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The cDNA fragments were released by EcoRI/XbaI restriction endonuclease digestion and ligated into pCI-neo expression vector (Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) which provides a cytomegalovirus promoter and enhancer. Transient transfection of chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells was performed in six-well plates containing approximately 2 × 105 cells/well, which were incubated at 37 °C overnight in the presence of 2 μg/well of calcium phosphate-precipitated VEGF-variant/pCI-neo DNA. For determination of transfection efficiency and protein secretion 1 μg/well pSBC-2/SEAP expression vector DNA (28Dirks W. Wirth M. Hauser H.

Cell culture supernatant was replaced with serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. Conditioned media (2 ml) were harvested, centrifuged, and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was prepared from transfected cells using an RNeasy kit (Quiagen, Hilden, Germany). Relative SEAP activity was determined as optical density at 405 nm of heat-inactivated (5 min at 65 °C) aliquots (100 μl) of conditioned media, which were incubated for 30–60 min at room temperature with 100 μl of SEAP-buffer (1m diethanolamine, 10 mm homoarginine, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 23 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate). Aliquots (30 μl) of conditioned media were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions, electrotransferred to nitrocellulose Hybond-N membranes (Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany), probed with the polyclonal antiserum K7.16 (29Grugel S.

Semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR for determination of VEGF RNA in transfected cells was performed by converting 1 μg of total RNA to cDNA using a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany) with random hexanucleotide primers followed by PCR amplification of a 247-base pair VEGF cDNA fragment and a 397-base pair GAPDH cDNA fragment simultaneously using the primers VEGF-E3 (5′-GGTGGACATCTTCCAGGAGTACCC-3′), VEGF-E5R (5′-TTCTTGTCTTGCTCTATCTTTCTTTG-3′), GAPDH1 (5′-AGCGAGACCCCACTAACATCAAA-3′), and GAPDH2 (5′-GTGGATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3′).

Quiescent HUVE cells were stimulated with increased concentrations of VEGF121proteins. After 18 h of VEGF-incubation [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi) was added and the incubation was continued for additional 6 h. The cells were washed and the incorporation of radioactivity was determined by scintillation counting. Amino-terminal truncated VEGF121variants were expressed in E. coli using the T7 RNA-polymerase driven pET system (27Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorf J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (5998) Google Scholar). The proteins were solubilized from inclusion body material, refolded, and finally purified by Ni2+-affinity chromatography essentially as described previously for wild-type VEGF121 (26Siemeister G. Schnurr B. Mohrs K. Schächtele C. Marmé D. Martiny-Baron G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 222: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The E. coli derived “wild-type” VEGF121 in fact covered amino acids Met3 to Arg121 of mature human VEGF121 and showed virtually identical biological activity as compared with human VEGF121 covering amino acids 1 to 121 produced by recombinant techniques in Sf9 insect cells (26Siemeister G.

The VEGF variants VEGF121Δ1–7 contained amino acids 8 to 121 of mature human VEGF121 with Gly8 changed to Met, and Gln9 changed to Glu due to insertion of anNcoI restriction endonuclease site, VEGF121Δ1–13 contained amino acids 14–121 with Val14 changed to Met, and VEGF121Δ1–17 contained amino acids 18–121 (Fig. 1 A). For control, VEGF121-C61S was prepared, a monomeric VEGF mutant with Cys61 replaced by serine which did not bind to endothelial cells and showed no significant biological activity (19Pötgens A.J.G. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An additional amino-terminal His6 tag facilitated affinity purification of the recombinant proteins. On nonreducing SDS gels VEGF121, VEGF121Δ1–7, and VEGF121Δ1–13 migrated with apparent molecular masses of approximately 34, 32, and 30 kDa, respectively, which correspond to the molecular mass of VEGF121 dimers (Fig. 1 B,lanes 1, 3, and 4). In contrast, VEGF121Δ1–17 (Fig. 1 B, lane 5), as well as the control, VEGF121-C61S (Fig. 1 B,lane 2), migrated as monomers of approximately 16 kDa. Upon electrophoresis on reducing SDS gels all of the VEGF variants migrated as monomeric forms of approximately 16–17 kDa (not shown). Inspection of the amino-terminal amino acid sequence using a structure predicting software (31Geourjon C. Deleage G. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) revealed an interspersed sequence of charged (His12, Glu13, Lys16, and Asp19) and hydrophobic (Val14, Val15, Phe17, and Met18) residues which might anticipate an amphipathic α-helical conformation (Fig. 2). Deletion of this domain apparently prevents dimerization of VEGF, at least in vitro. The interaction of the hydrophobic interface of the proposed amphipathic α-helix of one VEGF monomer either with the corresponding domain or with another hydrophobic stretch of the other VEGF monomer might stabilize or favor dimerization of VEGF. To further support this model we constructed a VEGF121 variant (VEGF121-Φ/S) covering amino acids Met3 to Arg121 in which we replaced the hydrophobic amino acids Val14, Val15, Phe17, and Met18 by serine. On nonreducing SDS gels this variant migrated most predominantly as a monomer (Fig. 1C, lane 4) as the deletion mutant VEGF121Δ1–17 (lane 3) did, and in contrast to dimeric VEGF121 and VEGF121Δ1–13 (lanes 1 and 2). From these data we concluded that the amino-terminal domain between His12 and Asp19 is essential at least forin vitro dimerization of VEGF. To analyze whether the amino-terminal domain between His12 and Asp19 is also essential for in vivo dimerization of VEGF the variant VEGF121 cDNAs were fused to the VEGF signal sequence, ligated into pCI-neo expression vector providing cytomegalovirus promoter/enhancer sequences, and transiently transfected into CHO cells. Due to fusion to the signal sequence the resulting expression plasmid pCI-neo/VEGF121 encoded the entire human VEGF121 coding region, whereas in construct pCI-neo/VEGF121Δ3–13 amino acids Met3 to Glu13 had been deleted and Val14 was replaced by Met, and in construct pCI-neo/VEGF121Δ3–18 amino acids Met3 to Phe17 had been deleted. Construct pCI-neo/VEGF121-Φ/S encoded the entire VEGF121 coding sequence in which the hydrophobic amino acids Val14, Val15, Phe17, and Met18 had been replaced by serine. Immunoblot analysis of conditioned media of the transfected cells using the polyclonal antiserum K7.16 raised against human VEGF protein showed that VEGF121 and VEGF121Δ3–13 migrated under nonreducing conditions as dimers (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1 and2). In contrast, in conditioned media of pCI-neo/VEGF121Δ3–18 and pCI-neo/VEGF121-Φ/S, as well as in pCI-neo vector control transfected CHO cells, no VEGF protein was detectable by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3 A, lanes 3–5). Western blot analysis of VEGF variants expressed in E. coli showed that the antiserum used was able to recognize all of the various VEGF variants including the monomeric ones (data not shown). Measurement of SEAP activity in conditioned media of the transfected cells revealed efficient transfection of the cells and efficient secretion of proteins even in transfections in which VEGF protein was not detectable in the conditioned medium (Fig. 3 B). Using lysates of transfected cells for Western blot analysis neither wild-type VEGF nor mutant VEGF variants were detectable demonstrating that wild-type VEGF and VEGF121Δ3–13 were secreted efficiently by the cells, and that the VEGF variants VEGF121Δ3–18 and VEGF121-Φ/S were not accumulated within the cells (not shown). Expression of transfected constructs for the VEGF variants at the level of mRNA was shown by semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (Fig. 3 C). Transfection of human “293” embryonic kidney cells gave similar results (not shown). Taken together these results show that the amino-terminal His12 to Asp19 domain is essential for functional expression of VEGF at least in transfected CHO and 293 cells. Truncation or mutation of this domain either impairs synthesis of VEGF or the cells recognize these variants as aberrant proteins which were apparently degraded. A PDGF-B variant in which the two cysteines involved in interchain disulfide bonds had been converted to serine, migrated as a monomer on non-reducing SDS gels, but exists as a noncovalent dimer at pH 4–7 in solution and shows similar mitogenic activity as compared with wild-type PDGF-BB (31Geourjon C. Deleage G. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 209-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 32Kenney W.C. Haniu M. Herman A.C. Arakawa T. Costigan V.J. Lary J. Yphantis D.A. Thomason A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12351-12359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the biological activity of the amino-terminal VEGF121 variants receptor binding assays and proliferation assays were performed. Binding of the VEGF variants expressed in E. coli to recombinant extracellular domain of human VEGF receptors Flt-1 (Fig. 4 A) and KDR (Fig. 4 B), respectively, was studied by competition assays with biotinylated VEGF165. The dimeric VEGF variants VEGF121Δ1–7 and VEGF121Δ1–13 competed with biotinylated VEGF for binding of both of the VEGF receptors in an almost undistinguishable manner as compared with wild-type VEGF121. Binding of the monomeric variant VEGF121Δ1–17, as well as the monomeric control VEGF121-C61S, to the receptors was strongly impaired. Growth of HUVE cells was stimulated by the VEGF variants VEGF121Δ1–7 and VEGF121Δ1–13 in a dose dependent manner which was almost undistinguishable from wild-type VEGF121 stimulated growth of the cells. The monomeric variants VEGF121Δ1–17 and VEGF121-C61S failed to induce proliferation of HUVE cells (Fig. 4 C). Taken together these results show that truncation or mutation of the VEGF amino-terminal α-helical domain prevents the formation of stable VEGF dimers although the cysteines involved in formation of the core structure of VEGF had not been affected. Dimerization of VEGF had previously been shown to be a prerequisite for biological activity (19Pötgens A.J.G. Lubsen N.H. van Altena M.C. Vermeulen R. Bakker A. Schoenmakers J.G.G. Ruiter D.J. de Waal R.M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32879-32885Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The analysis of amino-terminal truncated VEGF121variants revealed a domain between amino acids His12 and Asp19 that is essential for in vitrodimerization of VEGF and for functional expression of VEGF in vivo. This domain showed an interspersed sequence of charged and hydrophobic amino acids which may anticipate an amphipathic α-helical conformation. We postulate that the interaction of hydrophobic interfaces stabilize or favor dimerization of VEGF. Conversion of the hydrophobic amino acids to serine by site-directed mutagenesis, which results in VEGF monomers, supports this model. The very recently by Muller et al. (21Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) solved crystal structure of VEGF indeed revealed that the amino acids near the amino terminus anticipate an α-helical conformation. The crystal structure shows that hydrophobic amino acids from this α-helix together with residues from helix α2, loop regions β1–β3, and β5–β6, and sheet β6 of the other monomer form a small hydrophobic core that presumably stabilizes the central structure of the VEGF dimer. In addition, they found that a Phe17 to alanine mutant VEGF displayed on a phage surface lost KDR receptor binding implicating a contribution of Phe17 to receptor binding. As the conformation of the Phe17 → Ala mutant displayed on the phage surface was not investigated, our results implicate that loss of KDR binding is more likely due to impaired dimerization of the mutant VEGF. The His12 to Asp19 domain is highly conserved between human, sheep (34Redmer D.A. Dai Y. Li J. Charnock-Jones D.S. Smith S.K. Reynolds L.P. Moor R.M. J. Reprod.

Pajusola K. Kaipainen A. Von Euler G. Joukov V. Saksela O. Orpana A. Pettersson R.F. Alitalo K. Eriksson U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2576-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar). Heterodimerization of the members of the family of VEGF-related growth factors is thought to contribute to a fine tuning of angiogenic stimuli (41Cao Y. Linden P. Shima D. Browne F. Folkman J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2507-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Although the involvement of the amino-terminal domain in the heterodimerization between various VEGF-related growth factor monomers has not been investigated so far, the similarity of the amino-terminal domains of the VEGF-related proteins suggest that heterodimerization would be supported by these domains. Heterodimerization of VEGF and PDGF-B has not been observed so far although the eight cysteines building the core structure are perfectly conserved. One of the most significant differences in the crystal structure of VEGF (21Muller Y.A. Li B. Christinger H.W. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. de Vos A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7192-7197Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) and PDGF-B (42Oefner C. D'Arcy A. Winkler F.K. Eggimann B. Hosang M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3921-3926Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) is the structure of the amino terminus which is extended in PDGF rather than alpha-helical as in VEGF, whereas the monomer topology and side-by-side dimer association is highly similar for both proteins. In the PDGF-BB dimer the extended amino terminus of one chain makes contact to the other PDGF chain, but in contrast to VEGF, the amino terminus is not essential for dimerization of PDGF as it was shown by mutagenic analyses which resulted in the identification of the minimal v-sis transforming domain (22Hannink M. Donoghue D.J. Science. 1984; 226: 1197-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 23King C.R. Giese N.A. Robbins K.C. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1992; 358: 430-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), which is besides PDGF, VEGF, and nerve growth factor, another member of the cystine knot family of growth factors, revealed a close contact of α-helix H3 of one TGF-β2 chain to β-strand structures of the other chain in the TGF-β2dimer, which presumably stabilizes the dimeric structure. α-Helix H3 is located within TGF-β2 at a position that correlates to loop/turn II in PDGF-B and VEGF. Interference with the VEGF/VEGF-receptor system is generally viewed as an attractive target for therapeutical intervention in a variety of human pathological situations which involve elevated VEGF expression and aberrant endothelial cell proliferation such as tumor angiogenesis, diabetic retinopathy, rheumatoid arthritis, or psoriasis. Enhanced VEGF expression is induced by various factors and growth conditions including growth factors (see Finkenzeller et al. (44Finkenzeller G. Sparacio A. Technau A. Marmé D. Siemeister G.

The multiplicity of factors and mechanisms involved in VEGF expression hamper the development of therapeutical approaches directed to reduce enhanced expression of the growth factor in pathological settings. As VEGF dimerization is an event that is necessary for biological activity of the growth factor, but is independent from the diverse mechanisms of regulation of gene expression and translation, prevention of dimerization by interference with the amino-terminal domain may be a promising strategy for therapeutical down-regulation of VEGF expression.
