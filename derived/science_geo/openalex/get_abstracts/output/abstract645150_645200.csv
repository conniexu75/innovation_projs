This suggests that the expansion of layer 2/3, along with its numerous neurons and their large dendrites, may contribute to what makes us human. Gidon et al. thus investigated the dendritic physiology of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in slices taken from surgically resected brain tissue in epilepsy patients. Dual somatodendritic recordings revealed previously unknown classes of action potentials in the dendrites of these neurons, which make their activity far more complex than has been previously thought. These action potentials allow single neurons to solve two long-standing computational problems in neuroscience that were considered to require multilayer neural networks. Science , this issue p. 83"

Reinhard et al. describe a two-part “CARVac” strategy to overcome poor CAR-T cell stimulation and responses in vivo. They introduce the tight junction protein claudin 6 (CLDN6) as a new CAR-T cell target and designed a nanoparticulate RNA vaccine encoding a chimeric receptor directed toward CLDN6. This lipoplex RNA vaccine promotes CLDN6 expression on the surface of dendritic cells, which in turn stimulates and enhances the efficacy of CLDN6-CAR-T cells for improved tumor therapy.

Single point mutations in this gene are associated with resistance to the frontline artemisinin drugs. Birnbaum et al. found that Kelch13 and associated proteins comprise an endocytic compartment associated with feeding on host erythrocytes (see the Perspective by Marapana and Cowman). Hot targets for artemisinin research also occur in this compartment, including the proteins UBP1, AP-2µ, and the parasite homolog of the endocytosis protein Eps15. Inactivation of Kelch13 compartment proteins revealed that these are required for endocytosis of host hemoglobin. Artemisinins are activated by hemoglobin degradation products, so these mutations render the parasite resistant to these drugs to different extents. Science , this issue p. 51 ; see also p. 22"
https://openalex.org/W2997421965,"The stock market is known for its extreme complexity and volatility, and people are always looking for an accurate and effective way to guide stock trading. Long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are developed by recurrent neural networks (RNN) and have significant application value in many fields. In addition, LSTM avoids long-term dependence issues due to its unique storage unit structure, and it helps predict financial time series. Based on LSTM and an attention mechanism, a wavelet transform is used to denoise historical stock data, extract and train its features, and establish the prediction model of a stock price. We compared the results with the other three models, including the LSTM model, the LSTM model with wavelet denoising and the gated recurrent unit(GRU) neural network model on S&P 500, DJIA, HSI datasets. Results from experiments on the S&P 500 and DJIA datasets show that the coefficient of determination of the attention-based LSTM model is both higher than 0.94, and the mean square error of our model is both lower than 0.05."
https://openalex.org/W2997522589,"Particle accelerators represent an indispensable tool in science and industry. However, the size and cost of conventional radio-frequency accelerators limit the utility and reach of this technology. Dielectric laser accelerators (DLAs) provide a compact and cost-effective solution to this problem by driving accelerator nanostructures with visible or near-infrared (NIR) pulsed lasers, resulting in a 10$^4$ reduction of scale. Current implementations of DLAs rely on free-space lasers directly incident on the accelerating structures, limiting the scalability and integrability of this technology. Here we present the first experimental demonstration of a waveguide-integrated DLA, designed using a photonic inverse design approach. These on-chip devices accelerate sub-relativistic electrons of initial energy 83.4 keV by 1.21 keV over 30 um, providing peak acceleration gradients of 40.3 MeV/m. This progress represents a significant step towards a completely integrated MeV-scale dielectric laser accelerator."
https://openalex.org/W2998420832,"The possible realization of Majorana fermions as quasiparticle excitations in condensed matter physics has created much excitement. Most recent studies have focused on Majorana bound states which can serve as topological qubits. More generally, akin to elementary particles, Majorana fermions can propagate and display linear dispersion. These excitations have not yet been directly observed, and can also be used for quantum information processing. One route to realizing this is in a line junction between two phase-shifted superconductors coupled to topological surface states. Recent theory indicates that in iron-based superconductors, a particular type of crystalline defect, i.e., a domain wall (DW) between two regions with a half-unit cell shift between them, should create a $\pi$-phase shift in the superconducting order parameter. Combined with recent data showing topological surface states in FeSe$_x$Te$_{1-x}$ we find that this is the ideal system to realize helical 1D-dispersing Majorana modes. Here we report scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS) measurements of crystalline DWs in FeSe$_{0.45}$Te$_{0.55}$. By analyzing large-area superconducting gap maps, we identify the gap in the topological surface state, demonstrating that our sample is an effective Fu-Kane proximitized topological system. We further locate DWs across which the atoms shift by half a unit cell. STS data on these DWs reveal a flat density of states inside the superconducting gap, a hallmark of linearly dispersing modes in 1D. This unique signature is absent in DWs in the related superconductor, FeSe which is not in the topological phase. Our combined data are consistent with the observation of dispersing Majorana states at a $\pi$-phase shift DW in a proximitized topological material."

Patil et al. develop a theoretical analysis of the stability of knots and find links between topological parameters (twist charge, crossing numbers, handedness) and mechanical stability. The theory is confirmed using simulations and experiments on color-changing fibers that optically show localized stress differences in different parts of the knot as the two strands are pulled apart.

https://openalex.org/W2997554592,"Mutations in the GBA1 gene are the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). GBA1 encodes the lysosomal lipid hydrolase glucocerebrosidase (GCase), and its activity has been linked to accumulation of α-synuclein. The current study systematically examines the relationship between GCase activity and both pathogenic and non-pathogenic forms of α-synuclein in primary hippocampal, cortical, and midbrain neuron and astrocyte cultures, as well as in transgenic mice and a non-transgenic mouse model of PD. We find that reduced GCase activity does not result in aggregation of α-synuclein. However, in the context of extant misfolded α-synuclein, GCase activity modulates neuronal susceptibility to pathology. Furthermore, this modulation does not depend on neuron type but rather is driven by the level of pathological α-synuclein seeds. This study has implications for understanding how GBA1 mutations influence PD pathogenesis and provides a platform for testing novel therapeutics."

Romei et al. studied this behavior by introducing unnatural amino acids into the photoswitchable green fluorescent protein Dronpa2, thus systematically altering the electronic properties of the chromophore (see the Perspective by Hu et al. ). Crystal structures and spectroscopic analyses of a series of these variants support a model in which the electrostatic interactions between the chromophore and its environment influence the barrier heights for twisting around different bonds during photoisomerization. These insights may guide future design of photoswitchable proteins with desired properties. Science , this issue p. 76 ; see also p. 26"

https://openalex.org/W2997080716,"Despite being an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a known coding mutation in the gene HTT, Huntington's disease (HD) patients with similar trinucleotide repeat mutations can have an age of onset that varies by decades. One likely contributing factor is the genetic heterogeneity of patients that might modify their vulnerability to disease. We report that although the heterozygous depletion of the autophagy adaptor protein Alfy/Wdfy3 has no consequence in control mice, it significantly accelerates age of onset and progression of HD pathogenesis. Alfy is required in the adult brain for the autophagy-dependent clearance of proteinaceous deposits, and its depletion in mice and neurons derived from patient fibroblasts accelerates the aberrant accumulation of this pathological hallmark shared across adult-onset neurodegenerative diseases. These findings indicate that selectively compromising the ability to eliminate aggregated proteins is a pathogenic driver, and the selective elimination of aggregates may confer disease resistance."
https://openalex.org/W2997627718,"Cryptococcus neoformans and Cryptococcus gattii are two species complexes in the large fungal genus Cryptococcus and are responsible for potentially lethal disseminated infections. These two complexes share several phenotypic traits, such as production of the protective compound melanin. In C. neoformans, the pigment associates with key cellular constituents that are essential for melanin deposition within the cell wall. Consequently, melanization is modulated by changes in cell-wall composition or ultrastructure. However, whether similar factors influence melanization in C. gattii is unknown. Herein, we used transmission EM, biochemical assays, and solid-state NMR spectroscopy of representative isolates and “leaky melanin” mutant strains from each species complex to examine the compositional and structural factors governing cell-wall pigment deposition in C. neoformans and C. gattii. The principal findings were the following. 1) C. gattii R265 had an exceptionally high chitosan content compared with C. neoformans H99; a rich chitosan composition promoted homogeneous melanin distribution throughout the cell wall but did not increase the propensity of pigment deposition. 2) Strains from both species manifesting the leaky melanin phenotype had reduced chitosan content, which was compensated for by the production of lipids and other nonpolysaccharide constituents that depended on the species or mutation. 3) Changes in the relative rigidity of cell-wall chitin were associated with aberrant pigment retention, implicating cell-wall flexibility as an independent variable in cryptococcal melanin assembly.

https://openalex.org/W2996763297,"Nutritional improvements in intensive aquaculture production systems is necessary for the reduction of stress, maximum utilization of nutritional components, and expression of the genetic potential of fish. The objective of this study was to evaluate the hemato-immunological, and histological parameters and gut microbiota of Nile tilapia fed with the microalga Schizochytrium sp. Males of Nile tilapia were distributed among eight net cages (6 m3), and fed for 105 days with two diets: control (CON), without Schizochytrium sp., and supplemented (SUP), with 1.2% Schizochytrium sp. in the diet. The final weight, mortality, hematocrit, total erythrocyte count (RBC), hemoglobin, hematimetric indices, white blood cell count (WBC), total protein, and serum lysozyme were measured. Alterations in intestinal morphology were evaluated. The gut microbiota was evaluated with next-generation sequencing. No significant differences (p>0.05) were found in the final weight and mortality between diets. Regarding the hematological parameters, a difference (p<0.05) was detected only in RBC, with there being lower values in the SUP, although this group also showed a tendency toward having an increased mean corpuscular hemoglobin level. There were no differences (p>0.05) in total protein and serum lysozyme concentrations or in WBCs between diets, except for lymphocytes, which presented lower values (p<0.05) in the SUP, suggesting immunomodulation by the polyunsaturated fatty acids present in the microalga. There was no difference (p>0.05) in the intestinal morphology between diets. Metagenomic data indicated greater richness (represented by the Chao index) and a higher abundance of the bacterial phylum Firmicutes in the gut microbiota of the tilapia fed with the SUP diet, demonstrating that the digestion and use of the components of the microalga could influence the microbial community. The results indicated that the microalga had modulatory effects on blood cells and the intestinal microbiota, without affecting the structure and integrity of the intestinal villi."

We use data from a longitudinal study with a time-independent measure of risk to explore the association between exposure to greenspace and cardiovascular disease.Data was from the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer Norfolk UK cohort, baseline 1993-1997 (n = 24,420). Neighbourhoods were defined as 800m radius zones around participants' home, according to their home postcode (zip code) in the year 2000. Greenspace exposure was identified using classified satellite imagery. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression examined associations between greenspace and incident cardiovascular disease. Mediation analysis assessed if physical activity mediated associations, whilst modification by rurality, socio-economic status and age was explored.The mean age of participants was 59.2 years at baseline, 54.7% were female, and mean follow-up time was 14.5 years. Individuals living in the greenest neighbourhood quartile had a 7% lower relative hazard of developing cardiovascular disease than other neighbourhoods (HR 0.93; 95% CI 0.88, 0.97; p = 0.003) after adjusting for age, sex, BMI, prevalent diabetes and socio-economic status (SES). Physical activity did not mediate the relationship (greenest compared to the least green quartile HR 0.99; 95% CI 0.97, 1.01; p = 0.416). Models predicted incidence of cardiovascular disease in the least green neighbourhoods (19.4% greenspace on average) would fall by 4.8% (95% CI 1.6%, 8.2% p = 0.003) if they were as green as the average neighbourhood (59.0% greenspace). Occupation moderated the relationship, whereby exposure to greenspace was not associated with incident CVD for participants engaged in manual occupations.Greener home neighbourhoods may protect against risk of cardiovascular disease even after accounting for SES, whilst the mechanism does not appear to be strongly associated with physical activity. Putative causal mechanisms require investigation."

https://openalex.org/W2997067065,"It is a common view that an organism’s microbiota has a profound influence on host fitness; however, supporting evidence is lacking in many organisms. We manipulated the gut microbiome of Daphnia magna by chronic exposure to different concentrations of the antibiotic Ciprofloxacin (0.01–1 mg L-1), and evaluated whether this affected the animals fitness and antioxidant capacity. In line with our expectations, antibiotic exposure altered the microbiome in a concentration-dependent manner. However, contrary to these expectations, the reduced diversity of gut bacteria was not associated with any fitness detriment. Moreover, the growth-related parameters correlated negatively with microbial diversity; and, in the daphnids exposed to the lowest Ciprofloxacin concentrations, the antioxidant capacity, growth, and fecundity were even higher than in control animals. These findings suggest that Ciprofloxacin exerts direct stimulatory effects on growth and reproduction in the host, while microbiome- mediated effects are of lesser importance. Thus, although microbiome profiling of Daphnia may be a sensitive tool to identify early effects of antibiotic exposure, disentangling direct and microbiome-mediated effects on the host fitness is not straightforward."

https://openalex.org/W2997891612,"Background Ethiopia is one of the countries with a high burden of tuberculosis (TB). Jimma Zone has the lowest TB case notification rate compared to the national and World Health Organization’s (WHO) targets. The aim of the present study was to identify barriers, and explore the origin of these barriers in relation to TB case finding. Methods A qualitative study was conducted by using different data collection methods and sources. Sixty in-depth interviews with TB treatment providers, program managers and TB patients were included. In addition, 42 governmental health facilities were observed for availability of resources. Data obtained from the in-depth interviews were transcribed, coded, categorized and thematized. Atlas.ti version 7.1 software was used for the data coding and categorizing. Results Inadequate resources for TB case finding, such as a shortage of health-care providers, inadequate basic infrastructure, and inadequate diagnostic equipment and supplies, as well as limited access to TB diagnostic services such as an absence of nearby health facilities providing TB diagnostic services and health system delays in the diagnostic process, were identified as barriers for TB case finding. We identified the absence of trained laboratory professionals in 11, the absence of clean water supply in 13 and the electricity in seven health facilities. Furthermore, we found that difficult topography, the absence of proper roads, an inadequate collaboration with other sectors (such as education), a turnover of laboratory professionals, and a low community mobilization, as the origin of some of these barriers. Conclusion Inadequate resources for TB case finding, and a limited access to diagnostic services, were major challenges affecting TB case finding. The optimal application of the directly observed treatment short course (Stop TB) strategy is crucial to increase the current low TB case notification rate. Practical strategies need to be designed to attract and retain health professionals in the health system."
https://openalex.org/W2998680911,"Background Celiac disease (CD) is a systemic immune-mediated disorder developing in HLA genetically predisposed individuals carrying HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8 molecules. Recent evidences supported a predominant importance of HLA-DQB1 locus and, in particular, HLA-DQB1*02 alleles. This diagnosis is poorly considered in Kazakhstan, because of the assumption that CD is not prevalent in this population. Objective To demonstrate that the genetic predisposition to CD in Kazakhstan is not negligible and is actually comparable to Western populations. Methods Through the analysis of HLA-DQ genotypes of healthy bone marrow donors from Kazakhstan’s national registry, we estimated the HLA-related genetic predisposition to CD in the country. Results We demonstrated that the frequency of CD-related HLA-DQB1 alleles and, as a consequence, of predisposed individuals to CD in Kazakhstan is significant and comparable to countries with the highest disease prevalence. Conclusion Considering the dietary style in Kazakhstan, including wheat as a staple food, these results provided a preliminary background of knowledge to expect a significant CD prevalence in Kazakhstan and Central Asia by implementing appropriate and cost-effective diagnostic strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2998272717,"Objectives Depression is a common illness with substantial economic consequences for society and a great burden for affected individuals. About 30% of patients with depression do not respond to repeated treatments. Psychiatric comorbidity is known to affect duration, recurrence and treatment outcome of depression. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the extent to which psychiatric comorbidity is identified in the clinical setting for depressed patients in secondary psychiatric care. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare the agreement between traditional diagnostic assessment (TDA) and a structured and comprehensive diagnostic procedure (SCDP) for identification of personality and anxiety disorder comorbidity in depressed patients in secondary psychiatric care. Methods 274 patients aged 18–77 were referred from four secondary psychiatric care clinics in Sweden during 2012–2017. ICD-10 diagnoses according to TDA (mostly unstructured by psychiatric specialist and residents in psychiatry), were retrieved from medical records and compared to diagnoses resulting from the SCDP in the study. This included the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Structured Interview for DSM Axis II Personality Disorders and semi-structured questions on psychosocial circumstances, life-events, psychiatric symptoms, psychiatric treatments, substance use, and suicidal and self-harm behaviour. The assessment was carried out by psychiatric specialists or by residents in psychiatry with at least three years of psychiatric training. Results SCDP identified personality disorder comorbidity in 43% of the patients compared to 11% in TDA (p<0,0001). Anxiety disorder comorbidity was identified in 58% with SCDP compared to 12% with TDA (p<0,0001). Conclusions Important psychiatric comorbidity seems to be unrecognized in depressive patients when using TDA, which is routine in secondary psychiatric care. Comorbidities are better identified using the proposed model involving structured and semi-structured interviews together with clinical evaluations by clinical experts."
https://openalex.org/W2997069888,"The eastern Baltic cod (Gadus morhua) population has been decreasing in the Baltic Sea for at least 30 years. Condition indices of the Baltic cod have decreased, and previous studies have suggested that this might be due to overfishing, predation, lower dissolved oxygen or changes in salinity. However, numerous studies from the Baltic Sea have demonstrated an ongoing thiamine deficiency in several animal classes, both invertebrates and vertebrates. The thiamine status of the eastern Baltic cod was investigated to determine if thiamine deficiency might be a factor in ongoing population declines. Thiamine concentrations were determined by chemical analyses of thiamine, thiamine monophosphate and thiamine diphosphate (combined SumT) in the liver using high performance liquid chromatography. Biochemical analyses measured the activity of the thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme transketolase to determine the proportion of apoenzymes in both liver and brain tissue. These biochemical analyses showed that 77% of the cod were thiamine deficient in the liver, of which 13% had a severe thiamine deficiency (i.e. 25% transketolase enzymes lacked thiamine diphosphate). The brain tissue of 77% of the cod showed thiamine deficiency, of which 64% showed severe thiamine deficiency. The thiamine deficiency biomarkers were investigated to find correlations to different biological parameters, such as length, weight, otolith weight, age (annuli counting) and different organ weights. The results suggested that thiamine deficiency increased with age. The SumT concentration ranged between 2.4-24 nmol/g in the liver, where the specimens with heavier otoliths had lower values of SumT (P = 0.0031). Of the cod sampled, only 2% of the specimens had a Fulton's condition factor indicating a healthy specimen, and 49% had a condition factor below 0.8, indicating poor health status. These results, showing a severe thiamine deficiency in eastern Baltic cod from the only known area where spawning presently occurs for this species, are of grave concern."
https://openalex.org/W2998466223,"Background Sarcopenia is defined as a low skeletal muscle volume. Recent studies have reported that sarcopenia is associated with a poor prognosis in various cancers. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the correlation between the psoas muscle volume and recurrence-free survival in patients with localized clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Methods A total of 316 male patients with localized ccRCC who underwent radical nephrectomy at Yokohama City University Hospital (Yokohama, JAPAN) and Kanagawa Cancer Center (Yokohama, JAPAN) between 2002 and 2018 were enrolled in this study. The psoas muscle index (PMI) was calculated by normalizing the psoas muscle area on the contralateral side of the tumor on axial CT, which was calculated at the level of L4 (mm2) divided by the square of the body height (m2). We divided patients into two groups based on the median PMI (409.64mm2/m2). Results The lower PMI group showed poorer recurrence-free survival (RFS) than the higher PMI group (p = 0.030). Regarding 5-year RFS, a lower PMI was a significant predictor of recurrence (p = 0.022, hazard ratio (HR): 2.306) and a multivariate analysis revealed that a lower PMI (<median, p = 0.035, HR: 2.167), tumor size >4 cm (p = 0.044, HR: 2.341), and pathological stage >2 (p<0.001, HR: 3.660) were independent risk factors for poor RFS. Conclusions The presence of sarcopenia (lower PMI) was found to be associated with poor RFS in male ccRCC patients. The PMI might serve as a measure of patient frailty and might be useful for prognostic risk stratification in ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W2996888844,"Haptic exploration is a key skill for both robots and humans to discriminate and handle unknown objects or to recognize familiar objects. Its active nature is evident in humans who from early on reliably acquire sophisticated sensory-motor capabilities for active exploratory touch and directed manual exploration that associates surfaces and object properties with their spatial locations. This is in stark contrast to robotics. In this field, the relative lack of good real-world interaction models—along with very restricted sensors and a scarcity of suitable training data to leverage machine learning methods—has so far rendered haptic exploration a largely underdeveloped skill. In robot vision however, deep learning approaches and an abundance of available training data have triggered huge advances. In the present work, we connect recent advances in recurrent models of visual attention with previous insights about the organisation of human haptic search behavior, exploratory procedures and haptic glances for a novel architecture that learns a generative model of haptic exploration in a simulated three-dimensional environment. This environment contains a set of rigid static objects representing a selection of one-dimensional local shape features embedded in a 3D space: an edge, a flat and a convex surface. The proposed algorithm simultaneously optimizes main perception-action loop components: feature extraction, integration of features over time, and the control strategy, while continuously acquiring data online. Inspired by the Recurrent Attention Model, we formalize the target task of haptic object identification in a reinforcement learning framework and reward the learner in the case of success only. We perform a multi-module neural network training, including a feature extractor and a recurrent neural network module aiding pose control for storing and combining sequential sensory data. The resulting haptic meta-controller for the rigid 16 × 16 tactile sensor array moving in a physics-driven simulation environment, called the Haptic Attention Model, performs a sequence of haptic glances, and outputs corresponding force measurements. The resulting method has been successfully tested with four different objects. It achieved results close to 100% while performing object contour exploration that has been optimized for its own sensor morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2997257069,"Dune growth and post-storm recovery of foredune systems is predominantly determined by the aeolian sand transport through the beach-dune interface. Potential sand transport rates, estimated with empirical transport equations using regionally representative wind conditions, are generally too high. This positive bias might be, at least partly, due to the effect of the beach and foredune topography on the regional airflow. Here, we investigate the relation between local (on the beach) and regional wind velocities and direction in front of the high (∼22 m) and steep (∼1:2.5) foredune partially vegetated with Marram grass at Egmond aan Zee, The Netherlands based on a dataset with a large variety in wind speeds spanning over all onshore wind directions. We observed that local 10-minute averaged wind speed and direction can differ from the regional wind conditions (here measured 15 km away from the study site) depending on the regional approach angle of the wind. The ratio of local over regional wind speed is smallest (∼0.39) when the wind direction is dune-normal. This ratio increases with increasing obliquity towards almost 1 for alongshore winds. Wind steering only happens at the dune foot and is the largest (∼13°) with oblique approaching winds of 40° from the dune normal. Perpendicular and nearly alongshore winds do not show any steering near the dune foot. The use of local rather than regional wind conditions in a potential transport equation reduces the predicted annual supply from 86 to 32 m3/m/y, substantially closer to the measured deposition of 15 m3/m/y. The drop in velocity was more important to the reduction in predicted supply than the alongshore steering."
https://openalex.org/W2998466924,"The sea-run phenotype of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), like other anadromous salmonids, present a juvenile stage fully adapted to life in freshwater known as parr. Development in freshwater is followed by the smolt stage, where preadaptations needed for seawater life are developed making fish ready to migrate to the ocean, after which event they become post-smolts. While these three life stages have been studied using a variety of approaches, proteomics has never been used for such purpose. The present study characterised the blood plasma proteome of parr, smolt and post-smolt rainbow trout using a gel electrophoresis liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry approach alone or in combination with low-abundant protein enrichment technology (combinatorial peptide ligand library). In total, 1,822 proteins were quantified, 17.95% of them being detected only in plasma post enrichment. Across all life stages, the most abundant proteins were ankyrin-2, DNA primase large subunit, actin, serum albumin, apolipoproteins, hemoglobin subunits, hemopexin-like proteins and complement C3. When comparing the different life stages, 17 proteins involved in mechanisms to cope with hyperosmotic stress and retinal changes, as well as the downregulation of nonessential processes in smolts, were significantly different between parr and smolt samples. On the other hand, 11 proteins related to increased growth in post-smolts, and also related to coping with hyperosmotic stress and to retinal changes, were significantly different between smolt and post-smolt samples. Overall, this study presents a series of proteins with the potential to complement current seawater-readiness assessment tests in rainbow trout, which can be measured non-lethally in an easily accessible biofluid. Furthermore, this study represents a first in-depth characterisation of the rainbow trout blood plasma proteome, having considered three life stages of the fish and used both fractionation alone or in combination with enrichment methods to increase protein detection."
https://openalex.org/W2997428594,"We determine the number of statistically significant factors in a high dimensional predictive model of cryptocurrencies using a random matrix test. The applied predictive model is of the reduced rank regression (RRR) type; in particular, we choose a flavor that can be regarded as canonical correlation analysis (CCA). A variable selection of hourly cryptocurrencies is performed using the Symbolic estimation of Transfer Entropy (STE) measure from information theory. In simulated studies, STE shows better performance compared to the Granger causality approach when considering a nonlinear system and a linear system with many drivers. In the application to cryptocurrencies, the directed graph associated to the variable selection shows a robust pattern of predictor and response clusters, where the community detection was contrasted with the modularity approach. Also, the centralities of the network discriminate between the two main types of cryptocurrencies, i.e., coins and tokens. On the factor determination of the predictive model, the result supports retaining more factors contrary to the usual visual inspection, with the additional advantage that the subjective element is avoided. In particular, it is observed that the dynamic behavior of the number of factors is moderately anticorrelated with the dynamics of the constructed composite index of predictor and response cryptocurrencies. This finding opens up new insights for anticipating possible declines in cryptocurrency prices on exchanges. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of specific-predictor and specific-response factors, where only a small number of currencies are predominant."

But what comes first, changes in regulatory protein or changes in cis-regulatory sequences? Britton et al. examine the Matα2 protein in a Saccharomycotina clade of fungi. They show that a newly evolved transcription circuit involving repression of the a-specific genes by the ancient homeodomain protein Matα2 occurred in two stages separated by millions of years. In the first stage, Matα2 acquired several coding changes followed by changes in cis-regulatory sequences. This clade-specific requirement explains how the coding changes of Matα2 were in place long before the new a-specific gene repression circuit arose. Science , this issue p. 96"

Women with obesity are traditionally limited by the choices available to them during pregnancy and birth because of the higher risk of complications. This evidence synthesis set out to summarise how women with obesity’s perceptions of pregnancy and birth risk influence the care choices that they make. Methods A search of medical and health databases for qualitative studies written in the English language, published Jan 1993—April 2019 and reporting on pregnant women with obesity’s perception of risk and influence of pregnancy and birth choices. Data was extracted by two reviewers onto a questions framework and then analysed using a thematic synthesis technique. Confidence in the qualitative findings was assessed using GRADE-CERQual. Results 23 full texts were included. The common themes on perception of risk were: ‘Self-blame arising from others’ stereotyped beliefs ‘, ‘Normalisation’, ‘Lack of preparation’, ‘Fearful acceptance and inevitability’ and ‘Baby prioritised over mother’. For influence of choices, the themes were: ‘External influences from personal stresses’, ‘Restrictive guidelines’, ‘Relationship with healthcare professional’ and ‘Perception of Risk’. Conclusions Evidence on what influences women with obesity’s pregnancy choices is limited. Further research is needed on the best methods to discuss the risks of pregnancy and birth for women with obesity in a sensitive and acceptable manner and to identify the key influences when women with obesity make choices antenatally and for birth planning."

RNAi-mediated MELK depletion impairs growth and causes G2/M arrest in numerous cancers, but the mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. Furthermore, the MELK inhibitor OTSSP167 has recently been shown to have poor selectivity for MELK, complicating the use of this inhibitor as a tool compound to investigate MELK function. Here, using a cell-based proteomics technique called multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads/mass spectrometry (MIB/MS), we profiled the selectivity of two additional MELK inhibitors, NVS-MELK8a (8a) and HTH-01-091. Our results revealed that 8a is a highly selective MELK inhibitor, which we further used for functional studies. Resazurin and crystal violet assays indicated that 8a decreases triple-negative breast cancer cell viability, and immunoblotting revealed that impaired growth is due to perturbation of cell cycle progression rather than induction of apoptosis. Using double-thymidine synchronization and immunoblotting, we observed that MELK inhibition delays mitotic entry, which was associated with delayed activation of Aurora A, Aurora B, and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1). Following this delay, cells entered and completed mitosis. Using live-cell microscopy of cells harboring fluorescent proliferating cell nuclear antigen, we confirmed that 8a significantly and dose-dependently lengthens G2 phase. Collectively, our results provide a rationale for using 8a as a tool compound for functional studies of MELK and indicate that MELK inhibition delays mitotic entry, likely via transient G2/M checkpoint activation.

https://openalex.org/W2997634803,"Overqualification has both positive and negative outcomes; however, extant literature exhibits a tilt in favor of its negative aspect against its positive side. This tilted approach results in derision of a condition which could produce positive results. We argue, through empirical evidence, that there might be some circumstances/conditions, like the intentions of employees about their current job, that may play an important role in enabling organizations to be benefitted from the surplus KSAs of the overqualified employees and overqualification can be used as a tool to mitigate the effects of its negative consequences. To empirically test this condition, a sample of 193 teachers and 193 students have been selected through cluster sampling technique. The results exhibited that if overqualified employees perceive their current job as a career job then there is a more likelihood that they will be involved in some innovative and creative behaviors instead of deviating negatively from the organization norms. The results provide some new research insights that could be used to better understand the phenomenon of overqualification. The results of the study have practical implications for HR managers."
https://openalex.org/W2998347810,"Rice wild relatives (RWR) constitute an extended gene pool that can be tapped for the breeding of novel rice varieties adapted to abiotic stresses such as iron (Fe) toxicity. Therefore, we screened 75 Oryza genotypes including 16 domesticated O. sativa genotypes, one O. glaberrima, and 58 RWR representing 21 species, for tolerance to Fe toxicity. Plants were grown in a semi-artificial greenhouse setup, in which they were exposed either to control conditions, an Fe shock during the vegetative growth stage (acute treatment), or to a continuous moderately high Fe level (chronic treatment). In both stress treatments, foliar Fe concentrations were characteristic of Fe toxicity, and plants developed foliar stress symptoms, which were more pronounced in the chronic Fe stress especially toward the end of the growing season. Among the genotypes that produced seeds, only the chronic stress treatment significantly reduced yields due to increases in spikelet sterility. Moreover, a moderate but non-significant increase in grain Fe concentrations, and a significant increase in grain Zn concentrations were seen in chronic stress. Both domesticated rice and RWR exhibited substantial genotypic variation in their responses to Fe toxicity. Although no RWR strikingly outperformed domesticated rice in Fe toxic conditions, some genotypes scored highly in individual traits. Two O. meridionalis accessions were best in avoiding foliar symptom formation in acute Fe stress, while an O. rufipogon accession produced the highest grain yields in both chronic and acute Fe stress. In conclusion, this study provides the basis for using interspecific crosses for adapting rice to Fe toxicity."

https://openalex.org/W2998282880,"Treatment outcomes among patients treated for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) are often sub-optimal. Therefore, the early prediction of poor treatment outcomes may be useful in patient care, especially for clinicians when they have the ability to make treatment decisions or offer counselling or additional support to patients. The aim of this study was to develop a simple clinical risk score to predict poor treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB, using routinely collected data from two large countries in geographically distinct regions.We used MDR-TB data collected from Hunan Chest Hospital, China and Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia. The data were divided into derivation (n = 343; 60%) and validation groups (n = 227; 40%). A poor treatment outcome was defined as treatment failure, lost to follow up or death. A risk score for poor treatment outcomes was derived using a Cox proportional hazard model in the derivation group. The model was then validated in the validation group.The overall rate of poor treatment outcome was 39.5% (n = 225); 37.9% (n = 86) in the derivation group and 40.5% (n = 139) in the validation group. Three variables were identified as predictors of poor treatment outcomes, and each was assigned a number of points proportional to its regression coefficient. These predictors and their points were: 1) history of taking second-line TB treatment (2 points), 2) resistance to any fluoroquinolones (3 points), and 3) smear did not convert from positive to negative at two months (4 points). We summed these points to calculate the risk score for each patient; three risk groups were defined: low risk (0 to 2 points), medium risk (3 to 5 points), and high risk (6 to 9 points). In the derivation group, poor treatment outcomes were reported for these three groups as 14%, 27%, and 71%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the point system in the derivation group was 0.69 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) and was similar to that in the validation group (0.67; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; p = 0.82).History of second-line TB treatment, resistance to any fluoroquinolones, and smear non-conversion at two months can be used to estimate the risk of poor treatment outcome in patients with MDR-TB with a moderate degree of accuracy (AUROC = 0.69)."

Here, we demonstrate the possibility to reversibly manipulate select sites in the optimally doped high temperature superconductor Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$ using the local electric field of the tip. We show that upon shifting individual Bi atoms at the surface, the spectral gap associated with superconductivity is seen to reversibly change by as much as 15 meV (~5% of the total gap size). Our toy model that captures all observed characteristics suggests the field induces lateral movement of point-like objects that create a local pairing potential in the CuO2 plane."
https://openalex.org/W2997754565,"LZTFL1 participates in immune synapse formation, ciliogenesis, and the localization of ciliary proteins, and knockout of LZTFL1 induces abnormal distribution of heterotetrameric adaptor protein complex-1 (AP-1) in the Lztfl1-knockout mouse photoreceptor cells, suggesting that LZTFL1 is involved in intracellular transport. Here, we demonstrate that in vitro LZTFL1 directly binds to AP-1 and AP-2 and coimmunoprecipitates AP-1 and AP-2 from cell lysates. DxxFxxLxxxR motif of LZTFL1 is essential for these bindings, suggesting LZTFL1 has roles in AP-1 and AP-2-mediated protein trafficking. Since AP-1 and AP-2 are known to be involved in transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) trafficking, the effect of LZTFL1 on TfR1 recycling was analyzed. TfR1, AP-1 and LZTFL1 from cell lysates could be coimmunoprecipitated. However, pull-down results indicate there is no direct interaction between TfR1 and LZTFL1, suggesting that LZTFL1 interaction with TfR1 is indirect through AP-1. We report the colocalization of LZTFL1 and AP-1, AP-1 and TfR1 as well as LZTFL1 and TfR1 in the perinuclear region (PNR) and the cytoplasm, suggesting a potential complex between LZTFL1, AP-1 and TfR1. The results from the disruption of adaptin recruitment with brefeldin A treatment suggested ADP-ribosylation factor-dependent localization of LZFL1 and AP-1 in the PNR. Knockdown of AP-1 reduces the level of LZTFL1 in the PNR, suggesting that AP-1 plays a role in LZTFL1 trafficking. Knockout of LZTFL1 reduces the cell surface level and the rate of internalization of TfR1, leading to a decrease of transferrin uptake, efflux, and internalization. However, knockout of LZTFL1 did not affect the cell surface levels of epidermal growth factor receptor and cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, indicating that LZTFL1 specifically regulates the cell surface level of TfR1. These data support a novel role of LZTFL1 in regulating the cell surface TfR1 level by interacting with AP-1 and AP-2."
https://openalex.org/W2998454548,"A novel cardiac-specific transgenic mouse model was generated to identify the physiological consequences of elongated thin filaments during post-natal development in the heart. Remarkably, increasing the expression levels in vivo of just one sarcomeric protein, Lmod2, results in ~10% longer thin filaments (up to 26% longer in some individual sarcomeres) that produce up to 50% less contractile force. Increasing the levels of Lmod2 in vivo (Lmod2-TG) also allows us to probe the contribution of Lmod2 in the progression of cardiac myopathy because Lmod2-TG mice present with a unique cardiomyopathy involving enlarged atrial and ventricular lumens, increased heart mass, disorganized myofibrils and eventually, heart failure. Turning off of Lmod2 transgene expression at postnatal day 3 successfully prevents thin filament elongation, as well as gross morphological and functional disease progression. We show here that Lmod2 has an essential role in regulating cardiac contractile force and function."
https://openalex.org/W2997368733,"Third-stage larvae (L3) of Steinernema feltiae exist as free-living infective juveniles (IJ), with suspended development activities. In contrast, parasitic stages (L1, L2, L4, adult) have mutualistic relations with Xenorhabdus species bacteria, along with unique morphological changes and development inside the cadaver of host insects and/or plant-parasitic nematodes. Commercial IJ strains are tolerant to cucurbitacin-containing phytonematicides, but we have scant information on how morphological adjustments in IJ are achieved. In this study, we investigated the nature of morphological adjustments in commercial S. feltiae IJ strains to Nemafric-BL phytonematicide, which contains cucurbitacin B as active ingredient. Post-72 h exposure to phytonematicide concentration, IJ specimens were fixed on mounting slides. Length (body, excretory pore to anterior end, pharynx, rectum, stoma, tail), diameter (head width, neck base, mid-body, anal body), cuticle thickness and De Man ratios were measured with a computer software programme attached to Omax light microscope. Morphometric data against increasing phytonematicide concentration exhibited either density-dependent quadratic, linear or neutral relations. Increase in body length at low phytonematicide concentration was accompanied by decrease in tail length and pharynx length during muscle contraction when IJ were still alive. After death at high phytonematicide concentration, the opposite morphometric effects ensued due to muscle relaxation. The observed changes in morphometric structures were explained on the basis of morphological adjustments that modulated volumes of pseudocoelom cavity in IJ. The modulation is intended to maintain hydrostatic pressure within permissible upper limits in order to avoid structural damage to internal organs embedded in the pseudocoelom fluids."

We aim to evaluate whether it is cost-effective to de-escalate the biological form of DMARDs (bDMARDs). Methods Using a Markov model, we performed a cost-utility analysis for RA patients on bDMARD treatment. We compared continuing treatment (standard care) to a tapering approach (i.e., an immediate 50% dose reduction), withdrawal (i.e., an immediate 100% dose reduction) and tapering followed by withdrawal of bDMARDs. The parametrization is based on a comprehensive literature review. Results were computed for 30 years with a cycle length of three months. We applied the payer’s perspective for Germany and conducted deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. Results Tapering or withdrawing bDMARD treatment resulted in ICERs of €526,254 (incr. costs -78,845, incr. QALYs -0.1498) or €216,879 (incr. costs -€121,691, incr. QALYs -0.5611) compared to standard care. Tapering followed by withdrawal resulted in a loss of 0.4354 QALYs and savings of €107,969 per patient, with an ICER of €247,987. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed that our results remained largely unaffected by parameter changes. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis suggests that tapering, withdrawal and tapering followed by withdrawal were dominant in 39.8%, 28.2% and 29.0% of 10,000 iterations. Conclusion Our findings suggest that de-escalating bDMARDs in patients with RA may result in high cost savings but also a decrease in quality of life compared to standard care. If decision makers choose to implement de-escalation in daily practice, our results suggest the tapering approach."
https://openalex.org/W2997827983,"Measurement of cardiac function is vital for the health of pediatric patients with heart disease. Standard tools to measure function including echocardiogram and magnetic residence imaging are time intensive, costly, and have limited accessibility. The Vivio is a novel, non-invasive, handheld device that screens for cardiac dysfunction by analyzing intrinsic frequencies (IF) ω1 and ω2 of carotid artery waveforms. Prior studies demonstrated that left ventricular ejection fraction can be derived from IFs in adults. This study 1) studies whether the Vivio can capture carotid arterial pulse waveform data in children ages 0-19 years old; 2) tests the performance of two sensor head geometries, one larger and smaller than the standard size used in adults, designed for the pediatric population; 3) compares the IFs between pediatric age groups and adults with normal function. The Vivio successfully measured a carotid artery waveform in all children over 5 years old and 28% of children under the age of five. The small head did not accurately measure a waveform in any age group. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) demonstrated a difference in the IF ω1 between the adult and pediatric cohorts (F = 7.3, Prob>F = 0.0001). Post host analysis demonstrated a difference between the adult cohort (ω1 = 99 +/- 5 bpm) and the cohorts ages 0-4 (ω1 = 111 +/- 2 bpm; p = 0.0006) and 15-19 years old (ω1 = 105 +/-5 bpm; p = 0.02). One-way ANOVA demonstrated a difference in the IF ω2 between the adult and pediatric cohorts (F = 4.8, Prob>F = 0.003), specifically between the adult (ω2 = 81 +/- 13 bpm) and age 0-4 cohorts (ω2 = 48 +/- 8 bpm; p = 0.002). These results suggest that the Vivio can be used to capture carotid pulse waveform data in pediatric populations and that the data produced can be used to measure intrinsic frequencies."
https://openalex.org/W2997858965,"Social dominance is an important and widely used concept, however, different interpretations have led to ambiguity in the scientific literature and in popular science. Even though in ethology dominance is an attribute of dyadic encounters, and not a characteristic of the individual, 'dominance' has often been referred to as a personality trait in animals. Since few studies have specifically examined the link between personality traits and dominance status, we investigated this in dogs living in multi-dog households using a questionnaire, which required owners to specify whether the dog had a dominant or submissive status, and comprised items of both the features of the individual (i.e. personality traits) and previous social experience (interactions with group members and strangers). Four distinct personality factors emerged from 23 behavioural items by principal component analysis, labelled as assertiveness, trainability, intraspecific aggression and independence. Binomial logistic regression was used to examine how the demographic information of the dogs and the personality factors predicted the owner's estimate of the dog' status as dominant or submissive. The personality factor assertiveness accounted for 34% of the variance in dominance status, trainability 5% and dog age contributed 4%. Dogs perceived as dominant scored more highly on the factors assertiveness and trainability, which can help explain why 'dominance' has often been suggested to be a personality trait, rather than a dyad-specific social status according to different traditions in behavioural research. Similar to the 'social dominance' trait in humans, owner ascribed dominance showed a quadratic trajectory in cross-sectional mean change across the lifespan, increasing during adulthood and then maintaining high levels until old age. Overall, our study proposes a multifactorial background of dominance relationships in pet dogs, suggesting that not only previous experience of social interactions between individuals but also age and personality traits influence owner perceived dominance status in multi-dog households."
https://openalex.org/W2991839208,"Bayesian staircases are widely used in psychophysics to estimate detection thresholds. Simulations have revealed the importance of the parameters selected for the assumed subject’s psychometric function in enabling thresholds to be estimated with small bias and high precision. One important parameter is the slope of the psychometric function, or equivalently its spread. This is often held fixed, rather than estimated for individual subjects, because much larger numbers of trials are required to estimate the spread as well as the threshold. However, if this fixed value is wrong, the threshold estimate can be biased. Here we determine the optimal slope to minimize bias and maximize precision when measuring stereoacuity with Bayesian staircases. We performed 2- and 4AFC disparity detection stereo experiments in order to measure the spread of the disparity psychometric function in human observers assuming a Logistic function. We found a wide range, between 0.03 and 3.5 log10 arcsec, with little change with age. We then ran simulations to examine the optimal spread using the empirical data. From our simulations and for three different experiments, we recommend selecting assumed spread values between the percentiles 60–80% of the population distribution of spreads (these percentiles can be extended to other type of thresholds). For stereo thresholds, we recommend a spread around the value σ = 1.7 log10 arcsec for 2AFC (slope β = 4.3 /log10 arcsec), and around σ = 1.5 log10 arcsec for 4AFC (β = 4.9 /log10 arcsec). Finally, we compared a Bayesian procedure (ZEST using the optimal σ) with five Bayesian procedures that are versions of ZEST-2D, Psi, and Psi-marginal. In general, for the conditions tested, ZEST optimal σ showed the lowest threshold bias and highest precision."
https://openalex.org/W2997084060,"Studies on the effects of air pollution and more generally environmental exposures on health require measurements of pollutants, which are affected by measurement error. This is a cause of bias in the estimation of parameters relevant to the study and can lead to inaccurate conclusions when evaluating associations among pollutants, disease risk and biomarkers. Although the presence of measurement error in such studies has been recognized as a potential problem, it is rarely considered in applications and practical solutions are still lacking. In this work, we formulate Bayesian measurement error models and apply them to study the link between air pollution and omic signals. The data we use stem from the “Oxford Street II Study”, a randomized crossover trial in which 60 volunteers walked for two hours in a traffic-free area (Hyde Park) and in a busy shopping street (Oxford Street) of London. Metabolomic measurements were made in each individual as well as air pollution measurements, in order to investigate the association between short-term exposure to traffic related air pollution and perturbation of metabolic pathways. We implemented error-corrected models in a classical framework and used the flexibility of Bayesian hierarchical models to account for dependencies among omic signals, as well as among different pollutants. Models were implemented using traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulative methods as well as integrated Laplace approximation. The inclusion of a classical measurement error term resulted in variable estimates of the association between omic signals and traffic related air pollution measurements, where the direction of the bias was not predictable a priori. The models were successful in including and accounting for different correlation structures, both among omic signals and among different pollutant exposures. In general, more associations were identified when the correlation among omics and among pollutants were modeled, and their number increased when a measurement error term was additionally included in the multivariate models (particularly for the associations between metabolomics and NO2)."

Recent studies showed sex-specific outcomes and mechanisms of cerebral ischemic stroke. This study aimed to identify the key changes of gene expression between male and female IS in humans. Methods Gene expression dataset GSE22255, including peripheral blood samples, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset. Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs) with a LogFC>1, and a P-value <0.05 were screened by BioConductor R package and grouped in female, male and overlap DEGs for further bioinformatic analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) functional annotation, Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, “Molecular Complex Detection” (MCODE) modules, CytoNCA (cytoscape network centrality analysis) essential genes and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway interrelation analysis were performed. Results In a total of 54,665 genes, 185 (73 ups and 112 downs) DEGs in the female dataset, 461 DEGs (297 ups and 164 downs) in the male dataset, within which 118 DEGs overlapped (7 similar changes in female and male, 111 opposite changes in female and male) were obtained from the GSE22255 dataset. Female, male and overlapping DEGs enriched for similar cellular components and molecular function. Male DEGs enriched for divergent biological processes from female and overlapping DEGs. Sex-specific and overlapping DEGs were put into the PPI network. Overlapping genes such as IL6, presented opposite changes and were mainly involved in cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions, the TNF-signalling pathway, etc. Conclusion The analysis of sex-specific DEGs from GEO human blood samples showed that not only specific but also opposite DEG alterations in the female and male stroke genome wide dataset. The results provided an overview of sex-specific mechanisms, which might provide insight into stroke and its biomarkers and lead to sex-specific prognosis and treatment strategies in future clinical practice."

Although prevalent in all age groups, school aged children are a high-risk groups for STH infections. In Bhutan, epidemiological data on STH were collected from western Bhutan in 2003, which found a prevalence of 16.5%. However, little evidence is available on the prevalence of infection at national level. Therefore, this study was conducted with the aim to assess the prevalence and intensity of STH infections, and identify significant correlates of STH among students. A school-based survey was conducted in three regions of Bhutan. Two-stage cluster sampling was adopted to select a sample of 1500 students from 24 schools, in equal proportion from three regions of the country. A total of 1456 (97%) students were interviewed and their stool sample examined for the presence of parasites. Mini-FLOTAC technique was used to detect the parasite eggs/ova. The prevalence of any STH infection was 1.4%, with 0.8% Ascaris lumbricoides, 0.5% Trichuris trichiura and 0.2% hookworms. The eastern region had the highest prevalence at 2.3%. Except for one student who had moderate intensity of A. lumbricoides, the rest had light infection. Any STH presence was significantly associated with father's occupation, father's education level, type of house and the flooring of the house in which students reported to live. No significant associations were observed between water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) variables measured and presence of any STH infection. The prevalence of STH was found to be very low with primarily light intensity in this study. Nonetheless, it was also found that the sanitation situation is not ideal in the country, with several students reporting constant or partial open defecation leading to environmental contamination. Based on this prevalence and in line with the WHO guideline, it is recommended that deworming be reduced to once a year in combination with concerted health education on proper hygiene and sanitation practice."
