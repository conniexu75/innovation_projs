But T cells know when to stop—they express proteins on their surface such as CTLA4, which put on the brakes. Kuehn et al. now report genetic evidence of the importance of CTLA4 in humans (see the Perspective by Rieux-Laucat and Casanova). They identified six patients with mutations in one copy of CTLA4 . Patients presented with symptoms of an overzealous immune response, with immune cells infiltrating their organs. The findings support the idea that CTLA4 tells the immune system when enough is enough. Science , this issue p. 1623 ; see also p. 1560"
https://openalex.org/W2042848419,"Quantum information can be stored in micromechanical resonators, encoded as quanta of vibration known as phonons. The vibrational motion is then restricted to the stationary eigenmodes of the resonator, which thus serves as local storage for phonons. In contrast, we couple propagating phonons to an artificial atom in the quantum regime and reproduce findings from quantum optics, with sound taking over the role of light. Our results highlight the similarities between phonons and photons but also point to new opportunities arising from the characteristic features of quantum mechanical sound. The low propagation speed of phonons should enable new dynamic schemes for processing quantum information, and the short wavelength allows regimes of atomic physics to be explored that cannot be reached in photonic systems."
https://openalex.org/W2021217178,"Researchers have only recently started to take advantage of the developments in technology and communication for sharing data and documents. However, the exchange of experimental material has not taken advantage of this progress yet. In order to facilitate access to experimental material, the Bank of Standardized Stimuli (BOSS) project was created as a free standardized set of visual stimuli accessible to all researchers, through a normative database. The BOSS is currently the largest existing photo bank providing norms for more than 15 dimensions (e.g. familiarity, visual complexity, manipulability, etc.), making the BOSS an extremely useful research tool and a mean to homogenize scientific data worldwide. The first phase of the BOSS was completed in 2010, and contained 538 normative photos. The second phase of the BOSS project presented in this article, builds on the previous phase by adding 930 new normative photo stimuli. New categories of concepts were introduced, including animals, building infrastructures, body parts, and vehicles and the number of photos in other categories was increased. All new photos of the BOSS were normalized relative to their name, familiarity, visual complexity, object agreement, viewpoint agreement, and manipulability. The availability of these norms is a precious asset that should be considered for characterizing the stimuli as a function of the requirements of research and for controlling for potential confounding effects."

In this regard, the North African carnivorous theropod Spinosaurus , with its huge dorsal sail and a body larger than Tyrannosaurus rex , has long stood out. This species also stands out because of its history. The unfortunate loss of the type specimen during World War II left much of what we know about Spinosaurus to be divined through speculation and reconstruction. Ibrahim et al. now describe new fossils of this unusual species. They conclude it was, at least partly, aquatic, a first for dinosaurs. Science , this issue p. 1613"
https://openalex.org/W2004486295,"Antibiotic effectiveness is a natural societal resource that is diminished by antibiotic use. As with other such assets, keeping it available requires both conservation and innovation. Conservation encompasses making the best use of current antibiotic effectiveness by reducing demand through vaccination, infection control, diagnostics, public education, incentives for clinicians to prescribe fewer antibiotics, and restrictions on access to newer, last-resort antibiotics. Innovation includes improving the efficacy of current drugs and replenishing effectiveness by developing new drugs. In this paper, I assess the relative benefits and costs of these two approaches to maintaining our ability to treat infections."

By ignoring gender inequities, many development projects fail to achieve their objective. And when development organizations do not focus on women’s empowerment, they neglect the fact that empowered women have the potential to transform their societies. I also review the Gates Foundation’s record on gender and propose some approaches to improve it."

https://openalex.org/W1987253731,"The ability of an RNA virus to exist as a population of genetically distinct variants permits the virus to overcome events during infections that would otherwise limit virus multiplication or drive the population to extinction. Viral genetic diversity is created by the ribonucleotide misincorporation frequency of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We have identified a poliovirus (PV) RdRp derivative (H273R) possessing a mutator phenotype. GMP misincorporation efficiency for H273R RdRp in vitro was increased by 2–3-fold that manifested in a 2–3-fold increase in the diversity of the H273R PV population in cells. Circular sequencing analysis indicated that some mutations were RdRp-independent. Consistent with the population genetics theory, H273R PV was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture. Furthermore, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R PV virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in the cPVR mouse model. Reduced virulence correlated with the inability of H273R PV to sustain replication in tissues/organs in which WT persists. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R PV was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response, even when the infecting dose used was insufficient to elicit any visual signs of infection. We conclude that optimal RdRp fidelity is a virulence determinant that can be targeted for viral attenuation or antiviral therapies, and we suggest that the RdRp may not be the only source of mutations in a RNA virus genome.

Major challenges to virus survival occur during interactions with the host. Viruses struggle with host defense mechanisms, diverse cellular environments in different tissues, anatomic restrictions such as the blood-brain barrier, and host-to-host transmission. The outcomes of these multiple selective pressures determine tissue tropism and, ultimately, the pathogenic result of an infection. In this dynamic and changing environment, genetic diversity in RNA virus populations appears to be critical for fitness and survival and likely contributes to pathogenesis. For example, a poliovirus (PV) 6The abbreviations used are: PVpoliovirusRdRpRNA-dependent RNA polymerasem.o.i.multiplicity of infectionTEMtransmission electron microscopyqPCRquantitative PCRIUCACInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committeesym/subsymmetrical/substrate. mutant expressing a high fidelity (antimutator) RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) with a change of Gly-64 to Ser (G64S) displays an attenuated phenotype in susceptible mice. G64S efficiently replicates in a number of tissues but is restricted in its ability to access the central nervous system. Treatment of viral stocks with chemical mutagens to increase the number of mutations in the G64S genome to wild-type levels leads to a significant increase in neuropathogenesis. These observations provide compelling evidence that reduced population diversity restricts tissue tropism and determines an attenuated phenotype (1.Arnold J.J. Vignuzzi M. Stone J.K. Andino R.

Both the number of genetic variants in a population and the speed with which they are created likely determine the efficiency with which a virus can navigate the dynamic environment in the infected host. Mathematical models on population genetics, however, identified a theoretical limit to the number of mutations (extent of genetic diversity) a haploid genome can withstand when the yield of offspring (fecundity) is fixed (5.Bull J.J. Sanjuán R. Wilke C.O. Theory of lethal mutagenesis for viruses.J. Virol. 2007; 81: 2930-2939Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). It is therefore assumed that RNA viruses exhibit the highest mutation frequency tolerable, but the experimental evidence is limited to circumstances in which viruses are exposed to chemical mutagenesis (6.Anderson J.P.

Therapeutically targeting RNA viruses via lethal mutagenesis.Future Virol. 2008; 3: 553-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, existence of an RNA virus on the brink of extinction has been the explanation for the sensitivity of viruses to nucleoside analogues with ambiguous base-pairing capacity (6.Anderson J.P.

This class of nucleoside analogues has been termed lethal mutagens (6.Anderson J.P. Daifuku R. Loeb L.A. Viral error catastrophe by mutagenic nucleosides.Annu. Rev.

The most extensively characterized lethal mutagen is ribavirin, a drug currently included in the standard of care for the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection (6.Anderson J.P. Daifuku R. Loeb L.A. Viral error catastrophe by mutagenic nucleosides.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 58: 183-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 8.Graci J.D. Cameron C.E.

A complication with the interpretation of these experiments arises from the fact that lethal mutagens can have pleiotropic effects on cells, not the least of which is utilization of the compounds by cellular polymerases. One approach to explore the limits on viral population diversity with the least collateral damage is creation and characterization of a virus variant with a mutator phenotype. Poliovirus is an ideal model system to address this question because of the myriad tools available to study this virus (11.Racaniello V.R.

Host and virus determinants of picornavirus pathogenesis and tropism.Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2005; 3: 765-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, the only PV RdRp derivative known to exhibit a mutator phenotype yielded a dead virus, for reasons that may be unrelated to extinction catastrophe (13.Korneeva V.S. Cameron C.E.

For coxsackievirus B3, mutations were in the active site of the RdRp. However, for coronaviruses, mutations were in a putative proofreading exonuclease (16.Smith E.C. Blanc H. Vignuzzi M. Denison M.R. Coronaviruses lacking exoribonuclease activity are susceptible to lethal mutagenesis: evidence for proofreading and potential therapeutics.PLoS Pathog. 2013; 9: e1003565Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Because antimutator strains were not available for these systems, the question of an optimal fidelity could not be addressed directly but was inferred (15.Rozen-Gagnon K. Stapleford K.A. Mongelli V. Blanc H. Failloux A.B. Saleh M.C. Vignuzzi M.

Here, we describe a PV variant with an RdRp derivative exhibiting a mutator phenotype (H273R). GMP misincorporation and ribavirin triphosphate utilization efficiencies by H273R RdRp were significantly increased in vitro, leading to increased population diversity and ribavirin sensitivity of the virus in cells. H273R was driven to extinction more easily than WT in cell culture, indicating that WT virus is on the verge of the maximal mutation rate that can be tolerated without a loss in fitness. Interestingly, we observed a substantial reduction in H273R virulence, measured as the ability to cause paralysis in a susceptible mouse model (17.Crotty S. Hix L. Sigal L.J. Andino R. Poliovirus pathogenesis in a new poliovirus receptor transgenic mouse model: age-dependent paralysis and a mucosal route of infection.J. Gen. Virol. 2002; 83: 1707-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Reduced virulence was attributable to the inability of H273R to sustain replication in tissues/organs that are normally infected by PV. Despite the attenuated phenotype, H273R was capable of replicating in mice to levels sufficient to induce a protective immune response at doses in which inactivated virus would fail to elicit a protective response. These data demonstrate that population diversity is optimized for viral fitness. In combination with data for the high fidelity G64S variant, we conclude that the ability of RNA viruses to manipulate their genetic diversity confers upon a population a fast, effective mechanism to adapt to dynamic environments. However, substantial constraints exist on the sequence space that can be sampled without consequences for viral virulence. This study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Pennsylvania State University (assurance number A3400-01 UCSF and A3141-01 PSU). All efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and grown in DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin. PV type 1 Mahoney was used throughout this study. The H273R mutation was introduced into a modified 3Dpol-coding sequence by using overlap-extension PCR. In brief, the H273R clone was produced by overlap-extension PCR with oligonucleotides 3D-PV-AvrII-rev (5′-CCT GAG TGT TCC TAG GAT CTT TAG T-3′), 3D-PV-H273R-for (5′-CTA AAC CAC TCA CAC AGG CTG TAC AAG AAT AAA ACA-3′), and 3D-PV-PstI-for (5′-CCT GAG TGT TCC TAG GAT CTT TAG T-3′), 3D-PV-H273R-rev (5′-TGT TTT ATT CTT GTA CAG CCT GTG TGA GTG GTT TAG-3′) and with pET26Ub-3D-BPKN-I92T (18.Gohara D.W.

The final product of the second PCR was purified and digested with PstI and NheI and ligated into pET26Ub-3D-BPKN-I92T that had been digested with the same enzymes. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Pennsylvania State University). WT, G64S, and H273R RdRp derivatives were expressed in Escherichia coli by using a ubiquitin fusion system as described previously (18.Gohara D.W. Ha C.S. Kumar S. Ghosh B. Arnold J.J. Wisniewski T.J. Cameron C.E. Production of “authentic” poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)) by ubiquitin-protease-mediated cleavage in Escherichia coli.Protein Expr.

Chem. 2005; 280: 25706-25716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). RNA oligonucleotides were purified by denaturing PAGE as described previously (19.Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3D(pol)). Assembly of stable, elongation-competent complexes by using a symmetrical primer-template substrate (sym/sub).J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5329-5336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer and using the appropriate calculated extinction coefficient. RNA oligonucleotides were end-labeled by using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reactions, typically 100 µl, contained 1 µm [γ-32P]ATP, 100 µm RNA oligonucleotide, 1× Kinase Buffer, and 0.4 units/µl T4 polynucleotide kinase. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min and then placed at 65 °C for 10 min to heat-inactivate T4 polynucleotide kinase. RNA sym/sub primer-templates were produced by annealing 10–20 µm RNA oligonucleotides in T10E1 (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA) in a Progene Thermocycler (Techne). Annealing reactions were heated to 90 °C for 1 min and slowly cooled (5 °C/min) to 10 °C. Nucleotide incorporation experiments were performed as described previously (20.Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol): pre-steady-state kinetic analysis of ribonucleotide incorporation in the presence of Mg2+.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 5126-5137Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were performed in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 60 µm ZnCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2. All reactions were performed at 30 °C. Reactions were assembled by incubating 1 µm PV RdRp with 1 µm sym/sub RNA primer-template (0.5 µm duplex) for 3 min, allowing equilibration to 30 °C, and then rapidly mixing with the appropriate NTP substrate. Rapid mixing/quenching experiments were performed by using a model RQF-3 chemical quench-flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were quenched by addition of 0.5 m EDTA to a final concentration of 0.3 m. Products were analyzed by denaturing PAGE. Gels were visualized by using a PhosphorImager and quantified by using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Data were fit by nonlinear regression using the program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Time courses at fixed nucleotide concentration were fit to Equation 1, [product]=A⋅e(−kobs.t)+C(Eq. 1) where A is the maximal concentration of product formed; kobs is the observed first-order rate constant describing product formation; t is the time, and C is a constant. The apparent dissociation constant (Kd, app) and maximal rate for nucleotide incorporation (kpol) were determined using Equation 2, kobs=kpol⋅[NTP]kdd,app+[NTP](Eq. 2) To introduce the H273R mutation into the 3Dpol-coding sequence of viral cDNA, pMovRA, PCR was performed with oligonucleotides PV-3D-AvrII-rev, PV-3D-AflII-for (5′-AAC GAT CCC AGG CTT AAG ACA GAT TTT GAG-3′) and the pET26Ub-3D-BPKN-I92T-Arg-273 plasmid as template. PCR products were purified and digested with AvrII and AflII. The digested PCR product was ligated into pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD vector (21.Gohara D.W. Crotty S. Arnold J.J. Yoder J.D. Andino R. Cameron C.E. Poliovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (3Dpol): structural, biochemical, and biological analysis of conserved structural motifs A and B.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25523-25532Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a subclone of the viral cDNA. From this vector, the fragment between BglII and EcoRI was cloned into the viral cDNA plasmid (pMovRA). To introduce mutations into the subgenomic replicon, pRLucRA, the fragment between the BglII and AvrII sites from the mutated pUC18-BglII-EcoRI-3CD subclone vector was ligated into pRLucRA. DNA sequencing was used to verify the integrity of all clones. The H273K and H273Q mutations were introduced into the 3Dpol-coding sequence of viral cDNA, pMovRA, and subgenomic replicon, pRLucRA, by using overlap-extension PCR. In brief, PCR was performed with oligonucleotides 3D-PV-BglII-for (5′-TAG AGG ATC CAG ATC TTG GAT GCC A-3′), 3D-PV-H273K-rev (5′-TTG TTT ATT CTT GTA CAG TTT GTG TGA GTG GTT TAG-3′), 3D-PV-H273Q-rev (5′-TTG TTT ATT CTT GTA CAG CTG GTG TGA GTG GTT TAG-3′), and 3D-PV-EcoRI-ApaI-poly(A)-rev (5′-CGC TCA ATG AAT TCG GGC CCT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TCT CC-3′), 3D-PV-H273K-for (5′-CTA AAC CAC TCA CAC AAA CTG TAC AAG AAT AAA ACA-3′), and 3D-PV-H273Q-for (5′-CTA AAC CAC TCA CAC CAG CTG TAC AAG AAT AAA ACA-3′) and with pMo-3D-BPKN-I92T as a template. The final product of the second PCR was purified and digested with BglII and ApaI and ligated into pMo-3D-BPKN-I92T and pRLuc-3D-BPKN-I92T that had been digested with the same enzymes. The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Nucleic Acid Facility, Pennsylvania State University). The pMovRA and pRLucRA plasmids were linearized with EcoRI and ApaI, respectively, and purified with Qiaex II suspension (Qiagen) by following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA was then transcribed from the linearized plasmid DNAs in a 20-µl reaction mixture containing 350 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 32 mm magnesium acetate, 40 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 2 mm spermidine, 28 mm nucleoside triphosphates, 0.025 µg/µl linearized DNA, and 0.025 µg/µl T7 RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C, and magnesium pyrophosphate was removed by centrifugation for 2 min. The supernatant was transferred to a new tube, and RQ1 DNase (Promega) was used to remove the template. The RNA concentration was determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm, assuming that an A260 of 1 was equivalent to 40 µg/ml, and the RNA quality was verified by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 µg of viral RNA transcript, and these cells were serially diluted and plated onto HeLa cell monolayers. Cells were allowed to adhere to the plate for 1 h at 37 °C, and then the medium/PBS was aspirated. Cells were covered with 1× DMEM/F-12 plus 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 units/ml streptomycin, and 1% agarose. After 2–4 days of incubation, the agarose overlay was removed, and the cells were stained with crystal violet. HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 µg of viral RNA transcript, added to HeLa cell monolayers and incubated at 37 °C. Upon cytopathic effect, viruses were harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and virus titers were performed. The resulting virus stocks were passaged four times on HeLa cell monolayers at a low multiplicity of infection (m.o.i. of 0.01). For plaque assays, virus was serially diluted in PBS and placed on cells in 6-well plates to allow the virus to adsorb to the cells, and PBS was removed and replaced with media containing 1% agarose. After 2–4 days of incubation, the agarose overlay was removed, and cells were stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted to determine virus titer in pfu/ml. To analyze one-step virus growth, cells were infected with virus at a m.o.i. of 10. Virus was allowed to adsorb, and cells were washed with PBS and media added. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for various times post-infection. Virus was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and virus titers were performed. Viral RNA was isolated with QIAamp viral RNA purification kit (Qiagen), as recommended by the manufacturer. The 3Dpol cDNA was prepared from purified viral RNA by reverse transcription with Moloney murine leukemia virus-RT (New England Biolabs) with oligonucleotide 3D-BamHI-rev (5′-GCG GGA TCC TTA CTA AAA TGAGTC AAG CCA ACG GCG GTA-3′). The resulting DNA product was then PCR-amplified using SuperTaq DNA polymerase (Ambion) and oligonucleotides 3D-BamHI-rev and 3D-SacII-for (5′-GCG CCG CGG TGG AGG TGA AAT CCA GTG GAT GAG A-3′) as primers. The presence of Arg-273 was determined by sequencing of the nucleic acid obtained in second PCR step with oligonucleotide 3D-PV-PstI-for (5′-GGA GTG ATA ACA GGT TCT GCA GTG GGG TGC GAT-3′). Total RNA was isolated using TRI Reagent, separated on a 1% native agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane by passive capillary blotting, and then hybridization was performed using PCR-based probes to the three-dimensional region of the PV genome essentially as described previously (22.Oh H.S. Pathak H.B. Goodfellow I.G. Arnold J.J. Cameron C.E. Insight into poliovirus genome replication and encapsidation obtained from studies of 3B-3C cleavage site mutants.J.

HeLa cells were transfected by electroporation with 5 µg of replicon RNA transcript, transferred to pre-warmed media in microcentrifuge tubes, and incubated at 37 °C. At each time point, cells were pelleted by centrifugation; media were removed, and cells were lysed using cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Lysates were left on ice until luciferase and protein concentration assays were performed, at which point the lysates were centrifuged to remove cellular debris and nuclei. Assays were performed by mixing an equal volume of clarified lysate with luciferase assay substrate (Promega), and luciferase quantification was carried out as described by the supplier with a Junior LB 9509 luminometer (Berthold). Relative light units were adjusted to total protein concentration in the samples. Protein concentration was measured at 595 nm using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For experiments performed in the presence of ribavirin, HeLa cells were pretreated with ribavirin prior to transfection, and then transfected cells were transferred to media containing the same concentration of ribavirin. Twenty four viral isolates belonging to each of the WT and H273R populations were obtained by plaque isolation. Viral RNA was extracted and purified. PV cDNAs were generated by RT-PCR using viral RNA. The RT reaction was performed using the oligo(dT) primer. Two PCR products were obtained for each viral isolate, a product spanning the 5′-UTR and capsid coding region (nucleotides 300–3300) and a product spanning 3CD and 3′-UTR (relative light units 5800–7441). Primers for the 5′-product were 5′-CAGAGTGTAGCTTAGGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGTGGACGCGGGCACC-3′ (reverse). Primers for the 3′-product were 5′-CAGGGATATCTAAATCTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTCCGAATTAAAGAAAAATTTACCC-3′ (reverse). Direct sequencing was performed on PCR products. HeLa cell monolayers (8 × 106 cells) in 100 mm plates were infected with 8 × 104 pfu of either WT or H273R PV (m.o.i. of 0.01). Upon cytopathic effect, virus was harvested by three freeze-thaw cycles; cell debris was removed by centrifugation and Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40) added to 0.5% final concentration. The viral supernatant was mixed at a 1:1 ratio with a solution of 20% PEG-8000 and 1 m NaCl, incubated on ice at 4 °C for 12–24 h, and then centrifuged at 8000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was carefully washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl, and then suspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm NaCl (1 ml per 10 ml of viral supernatant). Viral RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent, suspended in RNase-free water, and then used for circular sequencing as described previously (23.Acevedo A. Brodsky L. Andino R.

HeLa cells were infected with 106 pfu of either WT or H273R PV in the presence of 3 mm guanidine hydrochloride and then washed and overlaid with agarose media containing 3 mm guanidine hydrochloride. Cells were incubated for 3–4 days at 37 °C before being stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted to determine the guanidine resistant frequency (guar/106 pfu). HeLa cells were infected with either WT, G64S, or H273R PV at an m.o.i. of 0.01 or 5 in the presence of 0–1000 µm ribavirin. Upon cytopathic effect, virus was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, and virus titers were performed. HeLa cell monolayers in 6-well plates were pretreated for 1 h with various concentrations of ribavirin and then infected with 50 pfu of WT (ribavirin-sensitive), G64S (ribavirin-resistant), or H273R PV, incubated for 20 min to allow for virus adsorption, and then washed and overlaid with 0.5% agarose media containing the same concentration of ribavirin. Plates were incubated for 3–4 days at 37 °C before overlays were removed, and monolayers were stained with crystal violet. Plaques were counted and compared with the untreated (0 mm ribavirin) control dish. To determine the IC50 value, the percentage of plaques was plotted as a function of ribavirin concentration and fit to a sigmoidal dose-response Equation 3, Y=A+((100−A)/(1+([ribavirin]/IC50))H)(Eq. 3) where Y is the % of plaques relative to untreated cells; A is the minimum % of plaques, and H is the Hill slope. HeLa cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 10 with a virus mixture composed of WT and H273R PV at a ratio of 1:9. After adsorption, input virus was removed, and infection was allowed to pro"

Fusion of sister kinetochores during meiosis I may underlie sister chromatid comigration in diverse organisms, but direct evidence for such fusion has been lacking. We used laser trapping and quantitative fluorescence microscopy to study native kinetochore particles isolated from yeast. Meiosis I kinetochores formed stronger attachments and carried more microtubule-binding elements than kinetochores isolated from cells in mitosis or meiosis II. The meiosis I–specific monopolin complex was both necessary and sufficient to drive these modifications. Thus, kinetochore fusion directs sister chromatid comigration, a conserved feature of meiosis that is fundamental to Mendelian inheritance."
https://openalex.org/W1980549694,"Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is a metabolic network of interconnected pathways that is required for the de novo synthesis of three of the four DNA bases and the remethylation of homocysteine to methionine. Previous studies have indicated that the thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation pathways compete for a limiting pool of methylenetetrahydrofolate cofactors and that thymidylate biosynthesis is preserved in folate deficiency at the expense of homocysteine remethylation, but the mechanisms are unknown. Recently, it was shown that thymidylate synthesis occurs in the nucleus, whereas homocysteine remethylation occurs in the cytosol. In this study we demonstrate that methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (MTHFD1), an enzyme that generates methylenetetrahydrofolate from formate, ATP, and NADPH, functions in the nucleus to support de novo thymidylate biosynthesis. MTHFD1 translocates to the nucleus in S-phase MCF-7 and HeLa cells. During folate deficiency mouse liver MTHFD1 levels are enriched in the nucleus >2-fold at the expense of levels in the cytosol. Furthermore, nuclear folate levels are resistant to folate depletion when total cellular folate levels are reduced by >50% in mouse liver. The enrichment of folate cofactors and MTHFD1 protein in the nucleus during folate deficiency in mouse liver and human cell lines accounts for previous metabolic studies that indicated 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate is preferentially directed toward de novo thymidylate biosynthesis at the expense of homocysteine remethylation during folate deficiency."

Methods Forty-seven myopic subjects were recruited for this prospective study. Fifteen underwent ReLEx smile and thirty-two underwent FS-LASIK. Corneal fluorescein (FL) staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer I test (SIT), ocular surface disease index (OSDI) and central corneal sensitivity were evaluated in all participants. Tears were collected and analyzed for interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), nerve growth factor (NGF) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) levels using multiplex magnetic beads. All measurements were preformed preoperatively and 1 day, 1 week, 1 month and 3 months postoperatively. Results FL scores in ReLEx smile group were lower than those of FS-LASIK group 1 week postoperatively (P = 0.010). Compared to the FS-LASIK group, longer TBUT were observed in ReLEx smile group 1 month (P = 0.029) and 3 months (P = 0.045) postoperatively. No significant differences were found in tear secretion for the two groups (P>0.05). OSDI scores were higher in FS-LASIK group 1 month after surgery (P = 0.020). Higher central corneal sensitivity was observed in ReLEx smile group 1 week, 1 month and 3 months (P<0.05) postoperatively. Compared to FS-LASIK group, lower and faster recovery of IL-6 and NGF levels in tears was observed in ReLEx smile group postoperatively (P<0.05). Tears TNF-α and ICAM-1 concentrations were not significantly different between the two groups at any follow-up time (P>0.05). Moreover, IL-6 and NGF levels correlated with ocular surface changes after ReLEx smile or FS-LASIK. Conclusions In the early postoperative period, ReLEx smile results in milder ocular surface changes than FS-LASIK. Furthermore, the tear inflammatory mediators IL-6 and NGF may play a crucial role in the ocular surface healing process following ReLEx smile and FS-LASIK."

https://openalex.org/W1971038407,"IL-6 mediated activation of Stat3 is a major signaling pathway in the process of breast cancer metastasis. One important mechanism by which the IL-6/Stat3 pathway promotes metastasis is through transcriptional regulation of the actin-bundling protein fascin. In this study, we further analyzed the transcriptional regulation of the fascin gene promoter. We show that in addition to IL-6, TNF-α increases Stat3 and NFκB binding to the fascin promoter to induce its expression. We also show that NFκB is required for Stat3 recruitment to the fascin promoter in response to IL-6. Furthermore, Stat3 and NFκB form a protein complex in response to cytokine stimulation. Finally, we demonstrate that an overlapping STAT/NFκB site in a highly conserved 160-bp region of the fascin promoter is sufficient and necessary to induce transcription in response to IL-6 and TNF-α."

Four volunteers (27%) demonstrated sterile immunity to controlled human malaria infection and, overall, protection was statistically significantly associated with ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ activities to AMA1 but not CSP. DNA priming was required for protection, as 18 additional subjects immunized with Ad alone (AdCA) did not develop sterile protection.We sought to identify correlates of protection, recognizing that DNA-priming may induce different responses than AdCA alone. Among protected volunteers, two and three had higher ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses to CSP and AMA1, respectively, than non-protected volunteers. Unexpectedly, non-protected volunteers in the AdCA trial showed ELISpot and CD8+ T cell IFN-γ responses to AMA1 equal to or higher than the protected volunteers. T cell functionality assessed by intracellular cytokine staining for IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-2 likewise did not distinguish protected from non-protected volunteers across both trials. However, three of the four protected volunteers showed higher effector to central memory CD8+ T cell ratios to AMA1, and one of these to CSP, than non-protected volunteers for both antigens. These responses were focused on discrete regions of CSP and AMA1. Class I epitopes restricted by A*03 or B*58 supertypes within these regions of AMA1 strongly recalled responses in three of four protected volunteers. We hypothesize that vaccine-induced effector memory CD8+ T cells recognizing a single class I epitope can confer sterile immunity to P. falciparum in humans.We suggest that better understanding of which epitopes within malaria antigens can confer sterile immunity and design of vaccine approaches that elicit responses to these epitopes will increase the potency of next generation gene-based vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2049709810,"High-fructose diets have been implicated in obesity via impairment of leptin signaling in humans and rodents. We investigated whether fructose-induced leptin resistance in mice could be used to study the metabolic consequences of fructose consumption in humans, particularly in children and adolescents. Male C57Bl/6 mice were weaned to a randomly assigned diet: high fructose, high sucrose, high fat, or control (sugar-free, low-fat). Mice were maintained on their diets for at least 14 weeks. While fructose-fed mice regularly consumed more kcal and expended more energy, there was no difference in body weight compared to control by the end of the study. Additionally, after 14 weeks, both fructose-fed and control mice displayed similar leptin sensitivity. Fructose-feeding also did not change circulating glucose, triglycerides, or free fatty acids. Though fructose has been linked to obesity in several animal models, our data fail to support a role for fructose intake through food lasting 3 months in altering of body weight and leptin signaling in mice. The lack of impact of fructose in the food of growing mice on either body weight or leptin sensitivity over this time frame was surprising, and important information for researchers interested in fructose and body weight regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2088631644,"Abnormalities in hepatic lipid metabolism and insulin action are believed to play a critical role in the etiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Monoacylglycerol acyltransferase (MGAT) enzymes convert monoacylglycerol to diacylglycerol, which is the penultimate step in one pathway for triacylglycerol synthesis. Hepatic expression of Mogat1, which encodes an MGAT enzyme, is increased in the livers of mice with hepatic steatosis, and knocking down Mogat1 improves glucose metabolism and hepatic insulin signaling, but whether increased MGAT activity plays a role in the etiology of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is unclear. To examine this issue, mice were placed on a diet containing high levels of trans fatty acids, fructose, and cholesterol (HTF-C diet) or a low fat control diet for 4 weeks. Mice were injected with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) to knockdown Mogat1 or a scrambled ASO control for 12 weeks while remaining on diet. The HTF-C diet caused glucose intolerance, hepatic steatosis, and induced hepatic gene expression markers of inflammation, macrophage infiltration, and stellate cell activation. Mogat1 ASO treatment, which suppressed Mogat1 expression in liver and adipose tissue, attenuated weight gain, improved glucose tolerance, improved hepatic insulin signaling, and decreased hepatic triacylglycerol content compared with control ASO-treated mice on HTF-C chow. However, Mogat1 ASO treatment did not reduce hepatic diacylglycerol, cholesterol, or free fatty acid content; improve histologic measures of liver injury; or reduce expression of markers of stellate cell activation, liver inflammation, and injury. In conclusion, inhibition of hepatic Mogat1 in HTF-C diet-fed mice improves hepatic metabolic abnormalities without attenuating liver inflammation and injury."

https://openalex.org/W1968318425,"RhoA is thought to be essential for coordination of the membrane protrusions and retractions required for immune cell motility and directed migration. Whether the subfamily of Rho (Ras homolog) GTPases (RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC) is actually required for the directed migration of primary cells is difficult to predict. Macrophages isolated from myeloid-restricted RhoA/RhoB (conditional) double knock-out (dKO) mice did not express RhoC and were essentially ""pan-Rho""-deficient. Using real-time chemotaxis assays, we found that retraction of the trailing edge was dissociated from the advance of the cell body in dKO cells, which developed extremely elongated tails. Surprisingly, velocity (of the cell body) was increased, whereas chemotactic efficiency was preserved, when compared with WT macrophages. Randomly migrating RhoA/RhoB dKO macrophages exhibited multiple small protrusions and developed large ""branches"" due to impaired lamellipodial retraction. A mouse model of peritonitis indicated that monocyte/macrophage recruitment was, surprisingly, more rapid in RhoA/RhoB dKO mice than in WT mice. In comparison with dKO cells, the phenotypes of single RhoA- or RhoB-deficient macrophages were mild due to mutual compensation. Furthermore, genetic deletion of RhoB partially reversed the motility defect of macrophages lacking the RhoGAP (Rho GTPase-activating protein) myosin IXb (Myo9b). In conclusion, the Rho subfamily is not required for ""front end"" functions (motility and chemotaxis), although both RhoA and RhoB are involved in pulling up the ""back end"" and resorbing lamellipodial membrane protrusions. Macrophages lacking Rho proteins migrate faster in vitro, which, in the case of the peritoneum, translates to more rapid in vivo monocyte/macrophage recruitment."

https://openalex.org/W2113406303,"To maintain the precise internal milieu of the mammalian central nervous system, well-controlled transfer of molecules from periphery into brain is required. Recently the soluble and cell-surface albumin-binding glycoprotein SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) has been implicated in albumin transport into developing brain, however the exact mechanism remains unknown. We postulate that SPARC is a docking site for albumin, mediating its uptake and transfer by choroid plexus epithelial cells from blood into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We used in vivo physiological measurements of transfer of endogenous (mouse) and exogenous (human) albumins, in situ Proximity Ligation Assay (in situ PLA), and qRT-PCR experiments to examine the cellular mechanism mediating protein transfer across the blood–CSF interface. We report that at all developmental stages mouse albumin and SPARC gave positive signals with in situ PLAs in plasma, CSF and within individual plexus cells suggesting a possible molecular interaction. In contrast, in situ PLA experiments in brain sections from mice injected with human albumin showed positive signals for human albumin in the vascular compartment that were only rarely identifiable within choroid plexus cells and only at older ages. Concentrations of both endogenous mouse albumin and exogenous (intraperitoneally injected) human albumin were estimated in plasma and CSF and expressed as CSF/plasma concentration ratios. Human albumin was not transferred through the mouse blood–CSF barrier to the same extent as endogenous mouse albumin, confirming results from in situ PLA. During postnatal development Sparc gene expression was higher in early postnatal ages than in the adult and changed in response to altered levels of albumin in blood plasma in a differential and developmentally regulated manner. Here we propose a possible cellular route and mechanism by which albumin is transferred from blood into CSF across a sub-population of specialised choroid plexus epithelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2086069753,"The amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) has caused mass mortality leading to population declines and extinctions in many frog species worldwide. The lack of host resistance may be due to fungal immunosuppressive effects that have been observed when Bd is incubated with cultured lymphocytes, but whether in vivo host immunosuppression occurs is unknown. We used a broad range of hematologic and protein electrophoresis biomarkers, along with various functional tests, to assess immune competence in common green (Litoria caerulea) and white-lipped (L. infrafrenata) tree frogs experimentally infected with Bd. Compared with uninfected frogs, Bd infection in L. caerulea caused a reduction in immunoglobulin and splenic lymphocyte responses to antigenic stimulation with sheep red blood cells, along with decreased white blood cell and serum protein concentrations, indicating possible impaired immune response capability of Bd-infected frogs. This is the first in vivo study suggesting that infection with Bd causes multiple defects in systemic host immune function, and this may contribute to disease development in susceptible host species. Although L. infrafrenata failed to maintain Bd infection after exposure, white blood cell and serum globulin concentrations were lower in recovered frogs compared with unexposed frogs, but antigen-specific serum and splenic antibody, and splenic cellular, responses were similar in both recovered and unexposed frogs. This may indicate potential systemic costs associated with infection clearance and/or redirection of host resources towards more effective mechanisms to overcome infection. No clear mechanism for resistance was identified in L. infrafrenata, suggesting that localized and/or innate immune defense mechanisms may be important factors involved in disease resistance in this species."

The objective of this study was to investigate compositional and contextual determinants of non-receipt of childhood vaccines in India using multilevel modelling.We studied characteristics of unvaccinated children using the District Level Health and Facility Survey 3, a nationally representative probability sample containing 65 617 children aged 12-23 months from 34 Indian states and territories. We developed four-level Bayesian binomial regression models to examine the determinants of non-vaccination. The analysis considered two outcomes: completely unvaccinated (CUV) children who had not received any of the eight vaccine doses recommended by India's Universal Immunization Programme, and children who had not received any dose from routine immunisation services (no RI). The no RI category includes CUV children and those who received only polio doses administered via mass campaigns. Overall, 4.83% (95% CI: 4.62-5.06) of children were CUV while 12.01% (11.68-12.35) had received no RI. Individual compositional factors strongly associated with CUV were: non-receipt of tetanus immunisation for mothers during pregnancy (OR = 3.65 [95% CrI: 3.30-4.02]), poorest household wealth index (OR = 2.44 [1.81-3.22] no maternal schooling (OR = 2.43 [1.41-4.05]) and no paternal schooling (OR = 1.83 [1.30-2.48]). In rural settings, the influence of maternal illiteracy disappeared whereas the role of household wealth index was reinforced. Factors associated with no RI were similar to those for CUV, but effect sizes for individual compositional factors were generally larger. Low maternal education was the strongest risk factor associated with no RI in all models. All multilevel models found significant variability at community, district, and state levels net of compositional factors.Non-vaccination in India is strongly related to compositional characteristics and is geographically distinct.

https://openalex.org/W2073723809,"In Arabidopsis, the regulation network of the seed maturation program controls the induction of seed dormancy. Wheat EST sequences showing homology with the master regulators of seed maturation, leafy cotyledon1 (LEC1), LEC2 and FUSCA3 (FUS3), were searched from databases and designated respectively as TaL1L (LEC1-LIKE), TaL2L (LEC2-LIKE), and TaFUS3. TaL1LA, TaL2LA and TaFUS3 mainly expressed in seeds or embryos, with the expression limited to the early stages of seed development. Results show that tissue-specific and developmental-stage-dependent expressions are similar to those of seed maturation regulators in Arabidopsis. In wheat cultivars, the expression level of TaL1LA is correlated significantly with the germination index (GI) of whole seeds at 40 days after pollination (DAP) (r = -0.83**). Expression levels of TaFUS3 and TaL2LA are significantly correlated respectively with GIs at 40 DAP and 50 DAP, except for dormant cultivars. No correlation was found between the expression level of TaVP1, orthologue of ABA insensitive3 (ABI3), and seed dormancy. Delay of germination1 (DOG1) was identified as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for the regulation of seed dormancy in Arabidopsis. Its promoter has RY motif, which is a target sequence of LEC2. Significant correlation was found between the expression of TaDOG1 and seed dormancy except for dormant cultivars. These results indicate that TaL1LA, TaL2LA, and TaFUS3 are wheat orthologues of seed maturation regulators. The expressions of these genes affect the level of seed dormancy.

https://openalex.org/W2044585846,"Q fever endocarditis, a severe complication of Q fever, is associated with a defective immune response, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. We hypothesized that Q fever immune deficiency is related to altered distribution and activation of circulating monocyte subsets. Monocyte subsets were analyzed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with Q fever endocarditis and controls. The proportion of classical monocytes (CD14+CD16− monocytes) was similar in patients and controls. In contrast, the patients with Q fever endocarditis exhibited a decrease in the non-classical and intermediate subsets of monocytes (CD16+ monocytes). The altered distribution of monocyte subsets in Q fever endocarditis was associated with changes in their activation profile. Indeed, the expression of HLA-DR, a canonical activation molecule, and PD-1, a co-inhibitory molecule, was increased in intermediate monocytes. This profile was not restricted to CD16+ monocytes because CD4+ T cells also overexpressed PD-1. The mechanism leading to the overexpression of PD-1 did not require the LPS from C. burnetii but involved interleukin-10, an immunosuppressive cytokine. Indeed, the incubation of control monocytes with interleukin-10 led to a higher expression of PD-1 and neutralizing interleukin-10 prevented C. burnetii-stimulated PD-1 expression. Taken together, these results show that the immune suppression of Q fever endocarditis involves a cross-talk between monocytes and CD4+ T cells expressing PD-1.

Several research groups have identified peptide-based inhibitors that target the polo-box domain (PBD) of Plk1 and bind to the protein with high affinity in in vitro assays. However, inadequate proteolytic resistance and cell permeability of the peptides hinder the development of these peptide-based inhibitors into novel therapeutic compounds.In order to overcome the shortcomings of peptide-based inhibitors, we designed and synthesized small molecule inhibitors. Among these molecules, bg-34 exhibited a high binding affinity for Plk1-PBD and it could cross the cell membrane in its unmodified form. Furthermore, bg-34-dependent inhibition of Plk1-PBD was sufficient for inducing apoptosis in HeLa cells. Moreover, modeling studies performed on Plk1-PBD in complex with bg-34 revealed that bg-34 can interact effectively with Plk1-PBD.We demonstrated that the molecule bg-34 is a potential drug candidate that exhibits anti-Plk1-PBD activity and possesses the favorable characteristics of high cell permeability and stability. We also determined that bg-34 induced apoptotic cell death by inhibiting Plk1-PBD in HeLa cells at the same concentration as PEGylated 4j peptide, which can inhibit Plk1-PBD activity 1000 times more effectively than bg-34 can in in vitro assays. This study may help to design and develop drug-like small molecule as Plk1-PBD inhibitor for better therapeutic activity."
https://openalex.org/W2080711874,"There is ongoing interest to develop high affinity, thermal stable recognition elements to replace conventional antibodies in biothreat detection assays. As part of this effort, single domain antibodies that target vaccinia virus were developed. Two llamas were immunized with killed viral particles followed by boosts with the recombinant membrane protein, L1, to stimulate the immune response for envelope and membrane proteins of the virus. The variable domains of the induced heavy chain antibodies were selected from M13 phage display libraries developed from isolated RNA. Selection via biopanning on the L1 antigen produced single domain antibodies that were specific and had affinities ranging from 4×10(-9) M to 7.0×10(-10) M, as determined by surface plasmon resonance. Several showed good ability to refold after heat denaturation. These L1-binding single domain antibodies, however, failed to recognize the killed vaccinia antigen. Useful vaccinia binding single domain antibodies were isolated by a second selection using the killed virus as the target. The virus binding single domain antibodies were incorporated in sandwich assays as both capture and tracer using the MAGPIX system yielding limits of detection down to 4×10(5) pfu/ml, a four-fold improvement over the limit obtained using conventional antibodies. This work demonstrates the development of anti-vaccinia single domain antibodies and their incorporation into sandwich assays for viral detection. It also highlights the properties of high affinity and thermal stability that are hallmarks of single domain antibodies."

Methods In this case-control study, the sera from 527 pregnant women with adverse pregnancy/neonatal outcomes and 496 mothers of healthy infants in Jiangsu Province, collected at gestation age of 15–20 weeks, were tested for anti-CMV IgG, IgM and IgG avidity. Adverse pregnancy/neonatal outcomes were identified based on pregnancy/neonatal outcomes. Results The overall seroprevalence of anti-CMV IgG was 98.7%, with 99.4% and 98.0% in the case and control groups, respectively (P = 0.039). The prevalence of anti-CMV IgG+/IgM+, was higher in the case group than that in the control group (3.8% vs. 1.6%, P = 0.033). Anti-CMV IgG avidity assay showed that none in the control group were primarily infected, but five (0.9%) in the case group underwent primary infection (P = 0.084); all five infants of these women presented severe adverse neonatal/growth outcomes. Exact logistic regression analysis showed that anti-CMV IgG+/IgM+ was associated with adverse pregnancy/neonatal/growth outcomes (aOR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.01–6.48, P = 0.047). Maternal low education level and prior abnormal pregnancies also were risk factors for adverse pregnancy/neonatal outcomes. Conclusions In populations with very high prevalence of latent CMV infection, active maternal CMV infection during pregnancy might be a risk factor for adverse pregnancy/neonatal outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W1985062331,"The identification of coral recruits has been problematic due to a lack of definitive morphological characters being available for higher taxonomic resolution. In this study, we tested whether fluorescent detection of coral recruits used in combinations of different DNA-barcoding markers (cytochrome oxidase I gene [COI], open reading frame [ORF], and nuclear Pax-C intron [PaxC]) could be useful for increasing the resolution of coral spat identification in ecological studies. One hundred and fifty settlement plates were emplaced at nine sites on the fringing reefs of Kenting National Park in southern Taiwan between April 2011 and September 2012. A total of 248 living coral spats and juveniles (with basal areas ranging from 0.21 to 134.57 mm(2)) were detected on the plates with the aid of fluorescent light and collected for molecular analyses. Using the COI DNA barcoding technique, 90.3% (224/248) of coral spats were successfully identified into six genera, including Acropora, Isopora, Montipora, Pocillopora, Porites, and Pavona. PaxC further separated I. cuneata and I. palifera of Isopora from Acropora, and ORF successfully identified the species of Pocillopora (except P. meandrina and P. eydouxi). Moreover, other cnidarian species such as actinarians, zoanthids, and Millepora species were visually found using fluorescence and identified by COI DNA barcoding. This combination of existing approaches greatly improved the taxonomic resolution of early coral life stages, which to date has been mainly limited to the family level based on skeletal identification. Overall, this study suggests important improvements for the identification of coral recruits in ecological studies."
https://openalex.org/W2028566919,"Background and Aims Amphibian intestinal remodeling, where thyroid hormone (T3) induces some larval epithelial cells to become adult stem cells analogous to the mammalian intestinal ones, serves as a unique model for studying how the adult stem cells are formed. To clarify its molecular mechanisms, we here investigated roles of non-canonical Wnt signaling in the larval-to-adult intestinal remodeling during Xenopus laevis metamorphosis. Methods/Findings Our quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemical analyses indicated that the expressions of Wnt5a and its receptors, frizzled 2 (Fzd2) and receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) are up-regulated by T3 and are spatiotemporally correlated with adult epithelial development in the X. laevis intestine. Notably, changes in morphology of larval absorptive epithelial cells expressing Ror2 coincide well with formation of the adult stem cells during metamorphosis. In addition, by using organ cultures of the tadpole intestine, we have experimentally shown that addition of exogenous Wnt5a protein to the culture medium causes morphological changes in the larval epithelium expressing Ror2 even in the absence of T3. In contrast, in the presence of T3 where the adult stem cells are formed in vitro, inhibition of endogenous Wnt5a by an anti-Wnt5a antibody suppressed the epithelial morphological changes, leading to the failure of stem cell formation. Significance Our findings strongly suggest that the adult stem cells originate from the larval absorptive cells expressing Ror2, which require Wnt5a/Ror2 signaling for their dedifferentiation accompanied by changes in cell morphology."
https://openalex.org/W2072472778,"Indian cultural tradition demanding marriage, many MSM howsoever they self-identify are likely to be married or have sex with women. To consolidate India's HIV prevention gains, it is important to understand and address the interaction between the MSM and heterosexual epidemics in India and create specific interventions for bisexual MSM. The challenge is to identify and intervene this hard to reach population. Data from HIV Sentinel Surveillance 2011 among MSM in four Indian states were analyzed to assess predictors and prevalence of bisexual behaviour in MSM.Between March-May 2011, 4682 men (15-49 years) who had anal/oral sex with a male partner in the past month, attending intervention sites and consenting for an un-linked anonymous survey answered an 11- item questionnaire and provided blood for HIV test by finger stick at 19 designated surveillance sites.Of 4682 MSM tested overall, 5% were illiterate, 51% reported only receptive anal intercourse, 21% only penetrative and 28% both. 36% MSM had ever received money for sex. Overall 6.8% were HIV infected. 44% MSM were bisexual in the last six months. On multivariate analysis, 'being bisexual' was found to be independently associated with 'older age': 26-30 years [AOR = 3.1, 95% CI(2.7, 3.7)], >30 years [AOR = 6.5, 95% CI(5.5, 7.7)]; 'reporting penetrative behaviour alone' with other men [AOR = 5.8, 95% CI(4.8, 7.0), p<0.01] and 'reporting both penetrative and receptive behaviour' [AOR = 2.7, 95% CI(2.3, 3.1) p<0.01]. Those who both paid and received money for sex [AOR = 0.49, 95% CI (0.38, 0.62)] were significantly less likely to be bisexual.A substantial proportion of men receiving services from Targeted Intervention programs are bisexual and the easy opportunity for intervention in this setting should be capitalised upon. Focusing on older MSM, as well as MSM who show penetrative behaviour with other men, could help in reaching this population."
https://openalex.org/W2017489411,"Planning, implementing, and evaluating interventions against infectious diseases depend on the nature of the infectious disease; the availability of intervention measures; and logistical, economic, and political constraints. Infectious diseases and vaccine- or drug-based interventions can be loosely categorized by the degree to which the infectious disease and the intervention are well established. Pertussis, polio, and measles are three examples of long-known infectious diseases for which global vaccination has dramatically reduced the public health burden. Pertussis vaccination was introduced in the 1940s, polio vaccination in the 1950s, and measles vaccination in the 1960s, nearly eliminating these diseases in many places."
https://openalex.org/W1997576453,"Several molecular detection marker genes specific for a number of individual Salmonella serogroups have been recently identified in our lab by comparative genomics for the genotyping of diverse serogroups. To further understand the correlation between serotype and genotype, the function of a Salmonella serogroup-C1-specific gene (SC_2092) was analyzed in this study. It was indicated from the topological prediction using the deduced amino acid sequence of SC_2092 that this putative protein was highly similar to the confirmed Wzx flippases. Furthermore, SDS-PAGE revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis, specifically O-antigen synthesis, was incomplete in an SC_2092 in-frame deletion mutant, and no agglutination reaction with the O7 antibody was exhibited in this mutant. Therefore, it was revealed that this Salmonella serogroup-C1-specific gene SC_2092 encoded a putative flippase, which was required for O7-polysaccharide biosynthesis, and was designated here as wzxC1. Subsequently, the effects of the deletion of wzxC1 on bacterial motility and sodium chloride (NaCl) tolerance were evaluated. The wzxC1 mutant lacked swarming motility on solid surfaces and was impaired in swimming motility in soft agar. Moreover, microscopic examination and RT-qPCR exhibited that an increased auto-aggregation and a strong defect in flagella expression, respectively, were responsible for the reduced motility in this mutant. In addition, the wzxC1 mutant was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to NaCl, and auto-aggregation of mutant cells was observed immediately up on the addition of 1% NaCl to the medium. Interestingly, the motility deficiency of the mutant strain, as well as the cell agglomeration and the decrease in flagellar expression, were relieved in a NaCl-free medium. This is the first study to experimentally demonstrate a connection between a Salmonella serogroup specific gene identified by comparative genomics with the synthesis of a specific O-antigen biosynthesis. Also, our results show that the mutation of wzxC1 triggers a NaCl-dependent motility deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2017034618,"Severe accidents caused by the ""armed"" spider Phoneutria nigriventer cause neurotoxic manifestations in victims. In experiments with rats, P. nigriventer venom (PNV) temporarily disrupts the properties of the BBB by affecting both the transcellular and the paracellular route. However, it is unclear how cells and/or proteins participate in the transient opening of the BBB. The present study demonstrates that PNV is a substrate for the multidrug resistance protein-1 (MRP1) in cultured astrocyte and endothelial cells (HUVEC) and increases mrp1 and cx43 and down-regulates glut1 mRNA transcripts in cultured astrocytes. The inhibition of nNOS by 7-nitroindazole suggests that NO derived from nNOS mediates some of these effects by either accentuating or opposing the effects of PNV. In vivo, MRP1, GLUT1 and Cx43 protein expression is increased differentially in the hippocampus and cerebellum, indicating region-related modulation of effects. PNV contains a plethora of Ca(2+), K(+) and Na(+) channel-acting neurotoxins that interfere with glutamate handling. It is suggested that the findings of the present study are the result of a complex interaction of signaling pathways, one of which is the NO, which regulates BBB-associated proteins in response to PNV interference on ions physiology. The present study provides additional insight into PNV-induced BBB dysfunction and shows that a protective mechanism is activated against the venom. The data shows that PNV has qualities for potential use in drug permeability studies across the BBB."
https://openalex.org/W2021209619,"Background Despite preventive efforts, HIV incidence remains high among men who have sex with men (MSM) in industrialized countries. Condoms are an important element in prevention but, given the high frequency of condom use and their imperfect effectiveness, a substantial number and proportion of HIV transmissions may occur despite condoms. We developed a model to examine this hypothesis. Methods We used estimates of annual prevalent and incident HIV infections for MSM in Ontario. For HIV-negative men, we applied frequencies of sexual episodes and per-contact HIV transmission risks of receptive and insertive anal sex with and without a condom and oral sex without a condom. We factored in the proportion of HIV-infected partners receiving antiretroviral therapy and its impact in reducing transmissibility. We used Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the plausible range for the proportion of HIV transmissions for each sexual practice. Results Among Ontario MSM in 2009, an estimated 92,963 HIV-negative men had 1,184,343 episodes of anal sex with a condom and 117,133 anal sex acts without a condom with an HIV-positive partner. Of the 693 new HIV infections, 51% were through anal sex with a condom, 33% anal sex without a condom and 16% oral sex. For anal sex with a condom, the 95% confidence limits were 17% and 77%. Conclusions The proportion of HIV infections related to condom failure appears substantial and higher than previously thought. That 51% of transmissions occur despite condom use may be conservative (i.e. low) since we used a relatively high estimate (87.1%) for condom effectiveness. If condom effectiveness were closer to 70%, a value estimated from a recent CDC study, the number and proportion of HIV transmissions occurring despite condom use would be much higher. Therefore, while condom use should continue to be promoted and enhanced, this alone is unlikely to stem the tide of HIV infection among MSM."

https://openalex.org/W2094596814,"Objective Aerosol delivery holds potential to release surfactant or perfluorocarbon (PFC) to the lungs of neonates with respiratory distress syndrome with minimal airway manipulation. Nevertheless, lung deposition in neonates tends to be very low due to extremely low lung volumes, narrow airways and high respiratory rates. In the present study, the feasibility of enhancing lung deposition by intracorporeal delivery of aerosols was investigated using a physical model of neonatal conducting airways. Methods The main characteristics of the surfactant and PFC aerosols produced by a nebulization system, including the distal air pressure and air flow rate, liquid flow rate and mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD), were measured at different driving pressures (4–7 bar). Then, a three-dimensional model of the upper conducting airways of a neonate was manufactured by rapid prototyping and a deposition study was conducted. Results The nebulization system produced relatively large amounts of aerosol ranging between 0.3±0.0 ml/min for surfactant at a driving pressure of 4 bar, and 2.0±0.1 ml/min for distilled water (H2Od) at 6 bar, with MMADs between 2.61±0.1 µm for PFD at 7 bar and 10.18±0.4 µm for FC-75 at 6 bar. The deposition study showed that for surfactant and H2Od aerosols, the highest percentage of the aerosolized mass (∼65%) was collected beyond the third generation of branching in the airway model. The use of this delivery system in combination with continuous positive airway pressure set at 5 cmH2O only increased total airway pressure by 1.59 cmH2O at the highest driving pressure (7 bar). Conclusion This aerosol generating system has the potential to deliver relatively large amounts of surfactant and PFC beyond the third generation of branching in a neonatal airway model with minimal alteration of pre-set respiratory support."
https://openalex.org/W2071198003,"Bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) are mobilized during injury and identified as lung progenitor cells, but the molecular regulation of this population of cells has not been elucidated. Secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (SFRP1) is a critical molecule involved in alveolar duct formation in the lung and here we demonstrate its importance in controlling cell differentiation during lung injury. Mice lacking SFRP1 exhibited a rapid repair response leading to aberrant proliferation of differentiated cells. Furthermore, SFRP1 treatment of BASCs maintained these cells in a quiescent state. In vivo overexpression of SFRP1 after injury suppressed differentiation and resulted in the accumulation of BASCs correlating with in vitro studies. These findings suggest that SFRP1 expression in the adult maintains progenitor cells within their undifferentiated state and suggests that manipulation of this pathway is a potential target to augment the lung repair process during disease."
https://openalex.org/W1970011932,"KLF6 is a member of the Krüppel-like factor family of transcription factors, with diverse roles in the regulation of cell physiology, including proliferation, signal transduction, and apoptosis. Mutations or down-regulation of KLF6 have been described in several human cancers. In this work, we found that KLF6-knockdown resulted in the formation of transformed foci and allowed the spontaneous conversion of NIH3T3 cells to a tumorigenic state. We further assessed the role of KLF6 in the context of oncogenic Ras. We showed that KLF6 was up-regulated by H-RasG12V expression in a Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-dependent manner, correlated with enhanced klf6 promoter activity. We found that ectopic KLF6 expression induced a G1-phase cell cycle arrest, thereby decreasing the cell proliferation rate. In addition, constitutive KLF6 expression impaired H-RasG12V-mediated loss of density-dependent growth inhibition and anchorage-independent growth. Moreover, growth of H-RasG12Vdriven tumors was reduced in mice challenged with cells stably expressing KLF6. KLF6 expression correlated with the up-regulation of p21, whereas neither p53 induction nor apoptotic cell death was detected. Further, p21 knockdown impaired KLF6-induced cell cycle arrest. These findings provide novel evidence highlighting KLF6 function in response to malignant transformation, suggesting the relevance of KLF6 in controlling cell proliferation and hindering tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2136696924,"Thumb interaction is a primary technique used to operate small handheld devices such as smartphones. Despite the different techniques involved in operating a handheld device compared to a personal computer, the keyboard layouts for both devices are similar. A handheld device keyboard that considers the physical capabilities of the thumb may improve user experience. We developed and applied a design evaluation tool for different geometries of the QWERTY keyboard using a performance evaluation model. The model utilizes previously collected data on thumb motor performance and posture for different tap locations and thumb movement directions. We calculated a performance index (PITOT, 0 is worst and 2 is best) for 663 designs consisting in different combinations of three variables: the keyboard's radius of curvature (R) (mm), orientation (O) (°), and vertical location on the screen (L). The current standard keyboard performed poorly (PITOT = 0.28) compared to other designs considered. Keyboard location (L) contributed to the greatest variability in performance out of the three design variables, suggesting that designers should modify this variable first. Performance was greatest for designs in the middle keyboard location. In addition, having a slightly upward curve (R = −20 mm) and orientated perpendicular to the thumb's long axis (O = −20°) improved performance to PITOT = 1.97. Poorest performances were associated with placement of the keyboard's spacebar in the bottom right corner of the screen (e.g., the worst was for R = 20 mm, O = 40°, L = Bottom (PITOT = 0.09)). While this evaluation tool can be used in the design process as an ergonomic reference to promote user motor performance, other design variables such as visual access and usability still remain unexplored."
https://openalex.org/W2067720807,"Cobalamin-dependent enzymes enhance the rate of C-Co bond cleavage by up to ∼10(12)-fold to generate cob(II)alamin and a transient adenosyl radical. In the case of the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and cobalamin-dependent enzymes lysine 5,6-aminomutase and ornithine 4,5 aminomutase (OAM), it has been proposed that a large scale domain reorientation of the cobalamin-binding domain is linked to radical catalysis. Here, OAM variants were designed to perturb the interface between the cobalamin-binding domain and the PLP-binding TIM barrel domain. Steady-state and single turnover kinetic studies of these variants, combined with pulsed electron-electron double resonance measurements of spin-labeled OAM were used to provide direct evidence for a dynamic interface between the cobalamin and PLP-binding domains. Our data suggest that following ligand binding-induced cleavage of the Lys(629)-PLP covalent bond, dynamic motion of the cobalamin-binding domain leads to conformational sampling of the available space. This supports radical catalysis through transient formation of a catalytically competent active state. Crucially, it appears that the formation of the state containing both a substrate/product radical and Co(II) does not restrict cobalamin domain motion. A similar conformational sampling mechanism has been proposed to support rapid electron transfer in a number of dynamic redox systems."
https://openalex.org/W1966293569,"The ability of small molecules to maintain self-renewal and to inhibit differentiation of pluripotent stem cells has been well-demonstrated. Two widely used molecules are PD 98059 (PD), an inhibitor of extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 1 (ERK), and SC1 (Pluripotin), which inhibits the RasGAP and ERK pathways. However, no studies have been conducted to compare their effects on the pluripotency and derivation of embryonic stem (ES) cells from inbred mice C57BL/6, an important mouse strain frequently used to model behavior, cognitive functions, immune system, and metabolic disorders in humans and also the first mouse strain chosen to be sequenced for its entire genome. We found significantly increased derivation efficiency of ES cells from in vivo fertilized embryos (fES) of C57BL/6 with the use of PD (71.4% over the control of 35.3%). Because fES and ES from cloned embryos (ntES) are not distinguishable in transcription or translation profiles, we used ntES cells to compare the effect of small molecules on their in vitro characteristics, in vitro differentiation ability, and the ability to generate full-term ntES-4N pups by tetraploid complementation. NtES cells exhibited typical ES characteristics and up-regulated Sox2 expression in media with either small-molecule. Higher rates of full term ntES-4N pup were generated by the supplementation of PD or SC1. We obtained the highest efficiency of ntES-4N pup generation ever reported from this strain by supplementing ES medium with SC1. Lastly, we compared the pluripotency of fES, ntES and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells of C57BL/6 background using the tetraploid complementation assay. A significant increase in implantation sites and the number of full-term pups were obtained when fES, ntES, and iPS cells were cultured with SC1 compared to the control ES medium. In conclusion, supplementing ES cell culture medium with PD and SC1 increases the derivation efficiency and pluripotency, respectively, of stem cells derived from the refractory inbred C57BL/6 strain."
