https://openalex.org/W1668086213,"The insulin-signaling pathway leading to the activation of Akt/protein kinase B has been well characterized except for a single step, the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. Double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene product, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), protein kinase Cα (PKCα), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), when complexed to rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), have all been identified as playing a critical role in Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation. However, the apparently disparate results reported in these studies are difficult to evaluate, given that different stimuli and cell types were examined and that all of the candidate proteins have never been systematically studied in a single system. Additionally, none of these studies were performed in a classical insulin-responsive cell type or tissue such as muscle or fat. We therefore examined each of these candidates in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In vitro kinase assays, using different subcellular fractions of 3T3-L1 adipocytes, revealed that phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation correlated well with the amount of DNA-PK, mTOR, and RICTOR but did not correlate with levels of ATM, ILK, and PKCα. PKCα was completely absent from compartments with Ser-473 phosphorylation activity. Although purified DNA-PK could phosphorylate a peptide derived from Akt that contains amino acid Ser-473, it could not phosphorylate full-length Akt2. Vesicles immunoprecipitated from low density microsomes using antibodies directed against mTOR or RICTOR had phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-stimulated Ser-473 activity that was sensitive to wortmannin but not staurosporine. In contrast, immunopurified low density microsome vesicles containing ILK could not phosphorylate Akt on Ser-473 in vitro. Small interference RNA knockdown of RICTOR, but not DNA-PK, ATM, or ILK, suppressed insulin-activated Ser-473 phosphorylation and, to a lesser extent, Thr-308 phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Based on our cell-free kinase and small interference RNA results, we conclude that mTOR complexed to RICTOR is the Ser-473 kinase in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.

Insulin increases glucose transport in muscle and fat by stimulating the translocation of the glucose transporter isoform Glut 4 from intracellular storage pools to the cell surface (1Cushman S.W.

Although the molecular events that occur after Akt activation are poorly understood, the early insulin signaling pathway has been well characterized except for one step, the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473. The signaling cascade is initiated when insulin binds to specific receptors at the plasma membrane (PM), 2The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membraneATMataxia telangiectasia mutated gene productCYTcytosolDNA-PKdouble-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinaseExtextractHDMhigh density microsome(s)HiPhigh speed pelletHMD-PKhydrophobic motif domain protein kinaseILKintegrin-linked kinaseLDMlow density microsomesmTORmammalian target of rapamycinNUCnuclearPIP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatePKCprotein kinase CRAPTORregulatory associated protein of mTORRICTORrapamycin-insensitive companion of mTORsiRNAsmall interference RNAIRSinsulin receptor substratePIphosphoinositideHMhydrophobic motifPHpleckstrin homologyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are: PMplasma membraneATMataxia telangiectasia mutated gene productCYTcytosolDNA-PKdouble-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinaseExtextractHDMhigh density microsome(s)HiPhigh speed pelletHMD-PKhydrophobic motif domain protein kinaseILKintegrin-linked kinaseLDMlow density microsomesmTORmammalian target of rapamycinNUCnuclearPIP3phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphatePKCprotein kinase CRAPTORregulatory associated protein of mTORRICTORrapamycin-insensitive companion of mTORsiRNAsmall interference RNAIRSinsulin receptor substratePIphosphoinositideHMhydrophobic motifPHpleckstrin homologyCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. triggering the autophosphorylation of several critical intracellular tyrosine residues and thereby activating an intrinsic tyrosine kinase that can phosphorylate cellular substrates, most notably the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins (9Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3842) Google Scholar, 10White M.F. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11White M.F. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins can recruit and activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), which generates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), using inositol-containing phospholipids in the PM as substrates (12Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The activity of Akt is markedly stimulated in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (13Lawlor M.A. Alessi D.R. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2903-2910Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon predominantly relies on the phosphorylation of Akt on two of its amino acid residues: 1) threonine 308 in the activation loop of the kinase catalytic domain and 2) serine 473 in the “hydrophobic motif” (HM) carboxyl-terminal domain (14Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). The phosphorylations of both of these regulatory sites occur after the recruitment of Akt to the PM through the binding of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to PIP3 (15Andjekkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2495) Google Scholar). The protein kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt on Thr-308 is phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (17Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 261-269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Stephens L. Anderson K. Stokoe D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Painter G.F. Holmes A.B. Gaffney P.R. Reese C.B. McCormick F.

Reese C.B. MacDougall C.N. Harbison D. Ashworth A. Bownes M. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 776-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The identity of the kinase responsible for phosphorylating Akt on Ser-473 is controversial.Akt is part of the protein kinase AGC (cAMP-dependent, cGMP-dependent, and protein kinase C) subfamily whose members are activated in a manner similar to Akt (20Frodin M. Antal T.L. Dummler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). All members possess a phosphorylation site in the activation loop equivalent to Thr-308, whereas only some require phosphorylation at the HM site. Some AGC members have a negatively charged acidic residue instead of a Ser/Thr in the C-terminal hydrophobic domain (21Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the HM site or substitution with an acidic residue provides a docking site to recruit phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 and stimulate the phosphorylation of Thr-308 (20Frodin M. Antal T.L. Dummler B.A. Jensen C.J. Deak M. Gammeltoft S. Biondi R.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5396-5407Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallographic studies have suggested that in the inactive state the activation loop of Akt adopts a disordered structure that prevents the binding of ATP and protein substrates (22Huang X. Begley M. Morgenstern K.A. Gu Y. Rose P. Zhao H. Zhu X. Structure (Camb.). 2003; 11: 21-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-473 results in a disorder to order transition, allowing interaction between the HM domain and the N-terminal lobe leading to the activation of the kinase (23Yang J. Cron P. Good V.M. Thompson V. Hemmings B.A. Barford D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar).At least 10 kinases have been proposed to function as the hydrophobic motif domain protein kinase (HMD-PK) that phosphorylates Akt on Ser-473, including integrin-linked kinase (ILK), protein kinase Cα (PKCα), double-stranded DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene product, and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (24Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 289: E187-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that Akt can undergo autophosphorylation at Ser-473 (25Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar); however, this is most likely not the mechanism by which insulin stimulates Ser-473 phosphorylation (15Andjekkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 21615-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Of all of the proposed candidates, evidence supporting DNA-PK and mTOR is the most compelling. Based on the observation that membrane localization is sufficient to activate Akt (15Andjekkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.C. Frech M. Cron P. Cohen P. Lucocq J.M. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31515-31524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar), Hemmings and co-workers used a biochemical approach to purify a constitutively active membrane kinase from HEK 293 cells capable of phosphorylating Akt on Ser-473 (28Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The kinase, DNA-PK, was found to associate and co-localize with Akt at the PM as well as phosphorylate and activate Akt 10-fold in vitro (29Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These results were surprising, since DNA-PK has been described as a nuclear protein involved in DNA replication, gene transcription, and DNA repair (30Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, knockdown studies with small interference RNA (siRNA) and experiments using DNA-PK-deficient glioblastoma cells revealed that insulin-stimulated Ser-473 phosphorylation was greatly impaired in both cases (29Feng J. Park J. Cron P. Hess D. Hemmings B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41189-41196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Like DNA-PK, mTOR is a member of the family of PI 3-kinase-related kinases whose activities are strongly inhibited by wortmannin and LY294002 (31Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar, 32Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar). mTOR can regulate cell growth and proliferation through its activation by growth factors and nutrients (33Fingar D.C. Blenis J. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 3151-3171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). It is also the best characterized HM kinase, capable of phosphorylating the hydrophobic motif of p70S6 kinase when mTOR is complexed with GβL (34Kim D.-H. Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Latek R.R. Guntur K.V. P. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 895-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar) and regulatory associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR) (35Hara K. Maruki Y. Long X. Yoshino K.-i. Oshiro N. Hidayat S. Tokunaga C. Avruch J. Yonezawa K. Cell. 2002; 110: 177-189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1430) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at the HM site of p70S6K (32Chung J. Kuo C.J. Crabtree G.R. Blenis J. Cell. 1992; 69: 1227-1236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) but not Akt (36Tremblay F. Gagnon A. Veilleux A. Sorisky A. Marette A. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 1328-1337Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 37Burgering B.M. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1871) Google Scholar) is inhibited by rapamycin. It is for this reason that mTOR was initially ruled out as being the HMD-PK for Akt. Recently, however, Sabatini and co-workers (31Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar, 38Sarbassov D.D. Ali S.M. Kim D.-H. Guertin D.A. Latek R.R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Sabatini D.M. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: 1296-1302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2122) Google Scholar) have shown that mTOR can associate with GβL and another protein called rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR), forming a rapamycin-insensitive complex capable of phosphorylating Akt at Ser-473. RNA interference experiments in Drosophila and human cell lines as well as several in vitro studies provide intriguing evidence that the mTOR·RICTOR complex can phosphorylate the HM site of Akt (31Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar).It is still not exactly clear which if any of the proposed candidate kinases are the HMD-PK for Akt in an insulin-responsive tissue such as muscle and fat. In fact, it has been suggested that phosphorylation of Ser-473 may be due to multiple kinases that are cell type- or signaling pathway-specific (24Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 289: E187-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Several years ago, we characterized the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 using a cell-free insulin-signaling assay that we developed using subcellular fractions from 3T3-L1 adipocytes (27Hresko R.C. Murata H. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21615-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 39Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We found that insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation at Ser-473 was PI 3-kinase-dependent and due to a kinase localized in both low density microsomes (LDM) and a subpopulation of the PM fraction enriched in proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton (Ext-HiP) (27Hresko R.C. Murata H. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21615-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Utilizing the cell-free system as well as in vivo siRNA knockdown studies, we addressed whether ILK, PKCα, DNA-PK, ATM, or mTOR was involved in the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Our results indicate that the mTOR·RICTOR complex is the HMD-PK for Akt in fat cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Culture of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 preadipocytes obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were grown to confluence and 48 h later subjected to differentiation as described previously (40Tordjman K.M. Leingang K.A. James D.E. Mueckler M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7761-7765Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). 3T3-L1 adipocytes were used 10-14 days after initiating differentiation except where otherwise noted.In Vitro Assay—Mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes were serum-starved overnight and then fractionated in the basal state as described previously, except that 1 mm dithiothreitol was included in HES (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors) and IC (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 140 mm potassium glutamate, 5 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors) buffers (39Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 41Piper R.C. Hess L.J. James D.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C570-C580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protease inhibitors (Sigma) were as described (39Murata H. Hresko R.C. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21607-21614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Ext-HiP and salt-washed plasma membranes were isolated in the manner described previously (27Hresko R.C. Murata H. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21615-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In vitro reactions were prepared by mixing various combinations of cytosol (CYT), PM, nuclear (NUC) enriched fraction, LDM, and Ext-HiP with 16 nm Akt2 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) and 10 μm PIP3 (Calbiochem), prepared in a sonicated mixture of 100 μm phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) and 100 μm phosphatidylserine (Avanti Polar Lipids). Reactions (typically 100 μl, final volume) were initiated with the addition of an ATP-regenerating system (final reaction concentrations, 1 mm ATP, 8 mm creatine phosphate, 30 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 5 mm MgCl2) and then incubated with rotation at 37 °C for the indicated period of time. Assays were quenched by the addition of an equal volume of buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and protease inhibitors) containing 2% SDS.Immunoblot Analysis—Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Akt phosphospecific and PKCα (2056) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. DNAPKcs (H-163) and ATM (5C2) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Two mTOR antibodies were used for immunoblot analysis, a polyclonal antibody mTOR (mTab2) from Upstate Biotechnology and a monoclonal antibody RAFT1 (611132) from BD Biosciences. RAPTOR antibodies were either from Cell Signaling Technology (4978) or from Abcam (antibody 5454). RICTOR antibodies were a kind gift from Dr. David M. Sabatini (Whitehead Institute) and were also obtained from Bethyl Laboratories. Immunoblots visualized by ECL detection (Amersham Biosciences) were quantified using NIH Image 1.62f. 6 and 12 μg of control proteins were run on each gel to establish the linearity of the autoradiogram.Immunoprecipitation of LDM—500 μg of LDM in 500 μl of IC buffer (with 1 mm dithiothreitol) were precleared with 40 μl of protein A-agarose for 30 min. After centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant was rotated overnight with 4 μg of primary antibody. Samples were then centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge to remove nonspecific aggregates that formed overnight. 30 μl of protein A-agarose were added to the supernatants for 2 h at 4°C. Pellets were washed six times with IC buffer, resuspended in IC buffer, and then assayed in vitro for HMD-PK activity. ILK (3862) polyclonal antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology), mTOR (mTab1) polyclonal antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology), and RICTOR antibodies (D. M. Sabatini) were used in the immunoprecipitation studies.HMD-PK Peptide Assay—HMD-PK activity was assayed using a modified version of Hill et al. (28Hill M.M. Feng J. Hemmings B.A. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1251-1255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). 50-μl reactions were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C in a buffer containing IC buffer, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 μm protein kinase A inhibitor peptide, 100 μm ATP, 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 0.5 mg/ml substrate (RRPHFPQFSYSASSTA), or control (RRPHFPQFAYSASSTA) peptide. Peptides were phosphorylated using 25 units DNA-PK (Promega), 0.75 mg/ml LDM, or 0.4 mg/ml Ext-HiP. 10 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA was added in some cases. Reactions were quenched by adding 5 μl of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and then centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at room temperature. 35 μl of the supernatant were spotted on P81 paper (Whatman), washed extensively in 0.1% phosphoric acid, and then analyzed by scintillation counting. Specific counts were calculated from the difference between the Ser-473 peptide and the control peptide.siRNA Duplexes—Complementary sense and antisense strands of RNA oligonucleotides for DNA-PK, ATM, and ILK were synthesized, annealed, and purified (PAGE) by Ambion. Negative control 1 siRNA (Ambion) and the following mouse sequences of strands of siRNA were used: DNA-PK sense, AGGGCCAAGCUAUCAUUCUtt; DNA-PK antisense, AGAAUGAUAGCUUGGCCCUtt; ATM sense, CAUACUACUCAAAGACAUUtt; ATM antisense, AAUGUCUUUGAGUAGUAUGtt; ILK sense, UGUUAAGUUUUCUUUCCAGUGtt; ILK antisense, CACUGGAAAGAAAACUUAACAtt. siGENOME Smartpool siRNA for RICTOR (M-064598-00; mouse 4921505C17RIK) and siCONTROL nontargeting siRNA 1 were from Dharmacon RNA Technologies.siRNA Electroporation of 3T3-L1 Adipocytes—3T3-L1 adipocytes were electroporated according to the procedure of Jiang et al.

Five days after differentiation, 3T3-L1 adipocytes were detached from cell culture plates with 1 mg/ml collagenase and 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA. Cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and resuspended in PBS prior to electroporation. Approximately 5 million cells (half of the cells on a 150-mm dish) were resuspended in 0.5 ml of PBS, mixed with 20 nmol of siRNA duplexes, and electroporated at the setting of 0.18 kV and 950 microfarads using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser Xcell electroporation system. Cells were immediately incubated with fresh media for 10 min before reseeding. Experiments were conducted 72 h after electroporation.RESULTSSubcellular Localizations of DNA-PK and mTOR·RICTOR Correlate with HMD-PK Activity—ILK, PKCα, DNA-PK, ATM, and mTOR have all been proposed to play a major role in Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation based on experiments carried out on a variety of different cell types and stimuli (24Dong L.Q. Liu F. Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 289: E187-E196Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). We have decided to directly compare the functions of these five proteins in terms of insulin-stimulated Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in a single cell type, 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Previously, we have shown that LDM and Ext-HiP, purified from 3T3-L1 adipocytes, are greatly enriched in insulin-stimulated HMD-PK activity (27Hresko R.C. Murata H. Mueckler M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 21615-21622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To determine whether any of these proteins are enriched in LDM and Ext-HiP, we carried out immunoblot analyses on subcellular fractions prepared from serum-starved 3T3-L1 adipocytes (Fig. 1). DNA-PK was found in the NUC fraction as expected due to its well documented nuclear functions (30Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). It was, however, more greatly enriched in LDM and Ext-HiP but absent (or below detection) in high density microsomes (HDM), mitochondrial, and CYT fractions. HDM is enriched in endoplasmic reticulum, and LDM contains Golgi markers (42Simpson A.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J. Wardzala L.J. Karnieli E. Salans L.B. Cuchman S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 763: 393-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). ATM, another member of the PI 3-kinase-related kinase family, had the same distribution as DNA-PK but was more abundant in NUC than LDM and Ext-HiP as compared with DNA-PK. ILK had a ubiquitous distribution but was slightly more enriched in NUC, LDM, and Ext-HiP fractions. PKCα was found almost exclusively in CYT in the basal state. PKCs are cytosolic proteins that translocate to membranes upon hormone stimulation (43Liu W.S. Heckman C.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 529-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). mTOR was greatly enriched in Ext-HiP but was also found in NUC, HDM, and LDM fractions. mTOR has been previously reported to be associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (44Drenan R.M. Liu X. Bertram P.G. Zheng X.F.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 772-778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and Golgi (44Drenan R.M. Liu X. Bertram P.G. Zheng X.F.S. J.

A. 2000; 97: 14340-14345Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). RICTOR, the binding protein of mTOR that is necessary for Ser-473 phosphorylation (31Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5156) Google Scholar), was very abundant in LDM and less abundant in Ext-HiP but was also present in NUC and HDM fractions.Next, we wanted to directly correlate HMD-PK activity with the amount of each candidate protein using the cell-free assay. We have previously shown that PIP3-dependent Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation in our in vitro assay was entirely dependent on exogenous ATP and the time of reaction incubation (27Hresko R.C. Murata H.

These sulfides are thought to be responsible for their epidemiologically proven anticancer effect on garlic eaters. This study was aimed at clarifying the molecular basis of this anticancer effect of garlic by using human colon cancer cell lines HCT-15 and DLD-1. The growth of the cells was significantly suppressed by diallyl trisulfide (DATS, HCT-15 IC50 = 11.5 μm, DLD-1 IC50 = 13.3 μm); however, neither diallyl monosulfide nor diallyl disulfide showed such an effect. The proportion of HCT-15 and that of DLD-1 cells residing at the G1 and S phases were decreased by DATS, and their populations at the G2/M phase were markedly increased for up to 12 h. The cells with a sub-G1 DNA content were increased thereafter. Caspase-3 activity was also dramatically increased by DATS. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis performed on the cells arrested at the G1/S boundary revealed cell cycle-dependent induction of apoptosis through the transition of the G2/M phase to the G1 phase by DATS. DATS inhibited tubulin polymerization in an in vitro cell-free system. DATS disrupted microtubule network formation of the cells, and microtubule fragments could be seen at the interphase. Peptide mass mapping by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis for DATS-treated tubulin demonstrated that there was a specific oxidative modification of cysteine residues Cys-12β and Cys-354β to form S-allylmercaptocysteine with a peptide mass increase of 72.1 Da.

Garlic is widely served around the world, and it has been reported that allyl sulfides inhibit both the initiation and promotion stages of tumorigenesis in experimental carcinogenesis models for various types of cancer (1Sparnins V.L.

We previously reported that the sulfur-containing volatile oils prepared from garlic and onion inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 (13Seki T. Tsuji K. Hayato Y. Moritomo T. Ariga T. Cancer Lett. 2000; 160: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumorigenesis of allyl sulfides are still not fully understood.Microtubules are ubiquitous proteins present in eukaryotes as components of the cytoskeleton and play pivotal roles in a variety of cellular processes involving cell division, motility, and intracellular trafficking (14Nogales E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 277-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). The microtubules are dynamic polymers composed of αβ-tubulin heterodimers, and they form the mitotic spindles, which are known to introduce the replicated DNA molecules to the respective daughter cell. Thus, antimitotic drugs developed for targeting microtubules have gained great success in cancer chemotherapy (15Checchi P.M. Nettles J.H. Zhou J. Snyder J.P. Joshi H.C. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 361-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16Jordan M.A. Wilson L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 253-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Various microtubule-interacting drugs, such as Vinca alkaloid and paclitaxel, cause mitotic arrest prior to the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells. It is quite natural that the suppression of spindle dynamics by these drugs hampers or completely blocks the mitosis of cells, especially at the transition from metaphase to anaphase.This study was aimed at clarifying the molecular target of allyl sulfides to understand the anticancer mechanism elicited by the consumption of garlic. We show the structure-function relationship of allyl sulfides in the inhibition of human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines at first, and the changes in the cells caused by DATS, which include the disruption of spindle formation, sustainment of the cyclin B1 expression, mitotic arrest, and finally apoptosis. We also report for the first time that the direct modification of specific cysteine residues in β-tubulin molecules by DATS in vitro causes these events. Finally, we show the tumor growth inhibition by DATS in a xenograft mouse model in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSCells and Chemicals—Human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT-15 and DLD-1 (obtained from Cell Resource Center for Biomedical Research, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan) were grown and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) at 37 °C in 95% air and 5% CO2. DAS and DADS were purchased from Tokyo Kasei Kogyo Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). DATS was synthesized by using Bunte salt (17Milligan B. Saville B. Swan J.M. J. Chem. Soc. 1962; : 4850-4853Google Scholar). DATS and commercial DADS were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (Alliance 2695 system; Waters Co., Milford, MA) on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (6 mm × 250 mm; GL Science, Tokyo, Japan).Cell Proliferation Assay—HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells were precultured for 48 h and then exposed to DAS, DADS, or DATS for 24 h. The cells were then counted with a hemocytometer. The rate of growth inhibition by the allyl sulfides was calculated based on the control culture, which was treated with vehicle only (0.1% Me2SO), taken as 100% growth.Cell Synchronization—HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells were synchronized at the G1/S boundary by the method known as the double thymidinehydroxyurea block. The cells were presynchronized at the S phase by incubation with 2.5 mm thymidine for 12 h. Then they were released by changing the medium to the thymidine-free fresh medium and incubating them for 12 h, after which they were resynchronized at the G1/S transition point by incubation with 1 mm hydroxyurea for 12 h. The cells were washed and incubated in the fresh medium to re-enter the cell cycle.Cell Cycle Analysis—The cell cycle distribution of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells was measured by flow cytometry. The harvested cells (∼106 cells) were fixed with ice-cold 70% ethanol, treated with 500 μg/ml RNase A (Sigma), and subsequently stained with 25 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma). Then they were analyzed by using a flow cytometer FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and FlowJo software (Treestar Inc., Ashland, OR).Western Blot Analysis of Cyclin B1—Total cellular protein (30 μg) was subjected to sodium dodecylsulfate-10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proteins separated were electrically transferred to a cellulose nitrate membrane (Advantec Toyo, Tokyo, Japan) for immunoblot analysis. The blot was incubated with mouse anti-cyclin B1 monoclonal antibody (1:2000; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:2000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h. The membrane was developed by using a commercial kit (HRP-1000 Immunostain; Konica, Tokyo, Japan).Fluorometric Assay of Caspase-3 Activity—Cell lysates containing 30 μg of protein were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer (20 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) containing 50 μm acetyl-l-aspartic-l-glutamic-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide) (Peptide Institute, Inc., Osaka, Japan). The 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released was measured by use of a spectrofluorometer with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm.Tubulin Polymerization Assay—Tubulin was purified from pig brain by use of a phosphocellulose column and dissolved in PIPES buffer (1.5 mg tubulin/ml of 80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm GTP). The tubulin solution was then placed in a thermostatically controlled cuvette at 4 °C for 10 min in the presence or absence of DATS. To initiate tubulin polymerization, the reaction mixture was warmed at 37 °C. The tubulin polymerization was monitored by measuring the increase in the absorbance at 340 nm.Indirect Immunofluorescence Microscopy—The cells were cultured on a Thermanox coverslip (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) and fixed with acetone/methanol (1:1) for 2 min at room temperature. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the fixed cells were incubated with mouse anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (1:500; Sigma) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min. The specific fluorescence was observed by a confocal microscope (Fluoview; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (1 mg/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 60 min in the presence or absence of 100 μm DATS. The DATS-treated and native tubulin were digested with modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) and analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry by using a MAGIC C18 column (0.15 mm × 50 mm; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA). The peptides were eluted over a 20-min period with a linear gradient 5-65% in terms of solvent B going from solvent A (2% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (90% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) with a flow rate of 0.8 μl/min. The tryptic peptide samples were separated and analyzed with a LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). Tandem mass spectrometry data obtained were analyzed by using SEQUEST, a computer program that allows the correlation of experimental data with theoretical spectra generated from known protein sequences (18Eng J. McCormack A. Yates J.R. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5367) Google Scholar). In this work, the general criteria for a preliminary positive peptide identification for a doubly charged peptide were a correlation factor greater than 2.5, a delta cross-correlation factor greater than 0.1 (indicating a significant difference between the best match reported and the next best match), a high preliminary scoring, and a minimum of one tryptic peptide terminus. For triply charged peptides, the correlation factor threshold was set at 3.5. All of the matched peptides were confirmed by visual examination of the spectra. All of the spectra were searched against the data in FASTA format generated from pig α-tubulin (NCBI accession number P02550) and pig β-tubulin (NCBI accession number P02554) in the data base of National Center for Biotechnology Information.Measurement of Cysteine Residues in Tubulin—The number of cysteine residues in the tubulin was determined by titrating the sulfhydryl group in tubulin with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. Phosphocellulose-purified tubulin (0.1 mg/ml) was incubated with 10 μm DATS or vehicle at 25 °C for 20 min. After the incubation, tubulin samples were mixed with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (1 mm), and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured. The number of cysteine residues was calculated from the standard curve drawn by using cysteine (Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan).Antitumor Effect of DATS on Mice Xenograft Model—All of the animal experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidelines for Animal Experiments of the College of Bioresource Sciences at Nihon University. Tumor xenografts were maintained by serial subcutaneous transplantation of 2 × 2 × 2-mm fragments of HCT-15 tumor into the right subaxillary region of 6-week-old female athymic CAnN.Cg-Foxn1nu/CrlCrlj mice (Charles River Laboratories Japan, Inc., Yokohama, Japan) on day 0. DATS (dissolved in 90% saline, 5% ethanol, and 5% Cremophore EL; Sigma, 6 mg/kg) or vehicle was injected into a tail vein on days 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, and 25 (every 3 days, 7 doses in total). Body weight and tumor sizes were measured every 5 days. Tumor volume was calculated by the equation V = [L × W2] × 0.52 (where V is volume, L is length, and W is width). The tumors excised were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h at 4 °C, embedded in paraffin, sectioned in 1.5-μm-thick sections, and stained with hematoxyline and eosine.RESULTSInhibition of the Growth of Human Colon Cancer Cells by Allyl Sulfides in Vitro—We initially examined the effect of allyl sulfides (structures shown in Fig. 1) on the growth of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells. The cell growth was significantly reduced by DATS in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50 = 11.5 ± 0.8 μm for HCT-15, IC50 = 13.3 ± 0.7 μm for DLD-1). In contrast, neither DAS nor DADS showed any effect on both cell lines. Microscopic observation revealed that most HCT-15 cells in the control cultures were in interphase, with only a small fraction (1-2%) of them in the M phase (Fig. 2B, 0 h). On the contrary, HCT-15 cells cultured in the presence of DATS exhibited mitotic arrest as early as 6 h. More than 60% of the cells were arrested at the M phase by the treatment with DATS for 12 h, and the mitotic morphology was observed for up to 18 h (Fig. 2B, 6, 12, and 18 h). In these cells, characteristic changes such as chromosome aggregation and disappearance of nuclear membrane were observed.FIGURE 2The effect of allyl sulfides on the proliferation and morphology of colon cancer cells. A, comparison of the effect of allyl sulfides on the proliferation of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells. The cells were incubated with various concentrations of DAS, DADS, or DATS for 24 h. The cell growth was expressed as a percentage of that of the vehicletreated control. B, morphological changes in HCT-15 cells treated with 20 μm DATS for the times indicated. The cells were stained with Giemsa. Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Cell Cycle Progression and Induction of Apoptosis by DATS—The effect of DATS on the cell cycle progression of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells was analyzed further by using flow cytometry. Under a normal condition in the absence of DATS, the cell cycle distribution of most HCT-15 and DLD-1 growing asynchronously was as follows: HCT-15 (51% in G1 phase, 35% in S phase, and 14% in G2/M phase) and DLD-1 (69% in G1 phase, 31% in S phase, and 9% in G2/M phase; Fig. 3A, 0h). When DATS was added to the cultures, the percentages of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells at G1 and S phase decreased, and the cell population at G2/M phase markedly increased in a time-dependent manner. HCT-15 cells at 12 h after the addition of DATS, ∼70% of the cells were at the G2/M phase (Fig. 3A, 12 h). The population of DLD-1 cells in the G2/M phase at 16 h after the addition of DATS reached maximum (Fig. 3A, 16 h). The cells with a sub-G1 DNA content, which is an indicator of apoptosis, appeared at 12-16 h and increased thereafter in HCT-15 and DLD-1 cultures treated with DATS (Fig. 3A, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h). Cyclin B1, a protein known to increase during the transition from the G2 through the M phase, was accumulated at 6-12 h after the DATS treatment (Fig. 3B). The time of expressing cyclin B1 in DATS-treated DLD-1 cells was slightly later than that in DATS-treated HCT-15 cells. This delay might be due to the difference in the doubling time of these cells. Caspase-3 activity also dramatically increase after the cells arrested at the G2/M phase (Fig. 3C). Hoechst 33258 staining of HCT-15 cells demonstrated that DATS treatment caused more chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation than found in the vehicle-treated control cells (Fig. 3D).FIGURE 3Effect of DATS on cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis. A, effect of DATS on the cell cycle distribution. HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells were treated with DATS (20 μm) for the times indicated, and the cell cycle distribution was analyzed by use of a flow cytometer. B, cyclin B1 expression detected by Western blotting. C, percentage of the cells arrested at the G2/M phase and the caspase-3 activity in the cells. HCT-15 cells were treated with 20 μm DATS for the times indicated. Cells at the G2/M phase were analyzed by using a flow cytometer, and caspase-3 activity in the cells was measured by using the fluorescent substrate acetyl-l-aspartic-l-glutamic-l-valyl-l-aspartic acid α-(4-methylcoumaryl-7-amide). The release of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) was monitored spectrofluorometrically with excitation at 380 nm and emission at 460 nm. D, morphological changes in nuclei were demonstrated by the staining with Hoechst 33258. HCT-15 cells were incubated with DATS for 24 h and then stained with Hoechst 33258. The scale bar represents 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Induction by DATS of Cell Cycle-dependent Apoptosis through the Transition of G2/M to G1 Phase—To determine whether the DATS-induced apoptosis originated from a specific stage of the cell cycle, we synchronized HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells at the G1/S boundary by the thymidine-hydroxyurea double-block method. After arrest of the cells at the G1/S boundary, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium containing vehicle (thymidine/hydroxyurea → vehicle) or DATS (thymidine/hydroxyurea → DATS). In HCT-15 cells, after releasing from the block at G1/S boundary, the vehicle-treated cells went into the late S phase at 4 h and the G2/M phase at 6 h (Fig. 4A). At 8 h post-release, the vehicle-treated cells already at the G2/M phase entered into the next G1 phase. Most of the cells were located in the G1 phase of the next cycle by 10 h after replacement of the culture medium. On the contrary, the cells released from the G1/S block in the presence of DATS exhibited a delayed cell cycle progression. At 8 h, 80% of the DATS-treated cells were in the G2/M phase. At 10-12 h, 60% of the cells still remained in the G2/M phase. After 10 h, the cells at sub-G1 markedly increased in number in a time-dependent manner. DLD-1 cells showed more delayed cell cycle progression than HCT-15 cells (Fig. 4B). DATS did not induce apoptosis of HCT-15 cells arrested at the G1/S phase, and the cells with a sub-G1 DNA content was 6.3% in the vehicle-treated cells and 7.8% in the DATS-treated cells, respectively. There was no apparent morphological difference between these two groups. These results suggest that induction of apoptosis by DATS requires the cell cycle progression from the G2/M to the G1 phase.FIGURE 4Detection of cell cycle-dependent apoptosis in DATS-treated HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells. The cell cycle of HCT-15 and DLD-1 cells was synchronized at the G1/S boundary by the thymidine-hydroxyurea (TdR/HU) double-block method. The cells were presynchronized at the S phase by incubation with 2.5 mm thymidine for 12 h, and then the cells were released by changing the medium to the thymidine-free fresh medium and incubated for 12 h and then resynchronized at the G1/S transition point by incubation with 1 mm hydroxyurea for 12 h. The cell cycle synchronized HCT-15 (A) and DLD-1 cells (B) were treated with vehicle or DATS, and the changes in the cell cycle distribution were monitored by flow cytometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Inhibition of Tubulin Polymerization by DATS in a Cell-free System— Based on the finding that DATS inhibited the mitosis of HCT-15 cells (Fig. 2B), we next examined the effect of DATS on the polymerization-depolymerization cycle of tubulin. Polymerization of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was measured in the presence of glycerol and GTP as an increase in turbidity (absorbance at 340 nm). As shown in Fig. 5A, colcemid, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, inhibited tubulin polymerization, whereas paclitaxel, a microtubule-stabilizing agent, enhanced it. DATS (10 μm) also completely inhibited microtubule formation. Neither DAS (100 μm) nor DADS (100 μm) showed any effect on the microtubule formation (Fig. 5B). These data indicate that like a microtubule-depolymerizing agent, DATS inhibits tubulin polymerization in a cellfree system.FIGURE 5Effect of DATS on the microtubule network formation. A and B, assembly of phosphocellulose-purified tubulin was measured by conducting a turbidity assay. Tubulin (1.5 mg/ml) was mixed with DAS, DADS, DATS, colcemid, or paclitaxel at 4 °C and then warmed at 37 °C to initiate the polymerization. The increase in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. C, the effect of DATS (10 μm), colcemid (100 ng/ml), or paclitacel (50 nm) on the microtubule network formation in DLD-1 cells was assessed by the immunofluorescence method using anti-β-tubulin antibody (green). The nucleus was counterstained with propidium iodide (magenta).

The normal microtubule distribution and its network formation were observed in the cytoplasm of vehicle-treated DLD-1 cells at interphase (Fig. 5C, Vehicle). Colcemid caused the disruption of microtubule network formation, whereas paclitaxel did not show any apparent influence on microtubule network formation at interphase (Fig. 5C, Colcemid (3 h) and Paclitaxel (3 h)). DATS caused the disruption of microtubule network formation by depolymerization of the microtubules, and most cells had shorter microtubule fragments than those observed in the cells at interphase. The shorter microtubules were scattered throughout the cytoplasm of the cells at 3 h after the DATS treatment (Fig. 5C, DATS (3 h)). Because the mitotic spindle is a highly dynamic structure, it is susceptible to antimitotic agents. DATS inhibited spindle formation, and the nuclear membrane disappeared from the cells treated with DATS. Treatment of DLD-1cells with DATS caused the accumulation of the cells at prometaphase; the nuclear membranes of the cells disappeared, and there was no spindle formation (Fig. 5C, DATS (12 h)). When the test compounds were added after having reached the maximum turbidity, both DATS and colcemid caused the decrease in the turbidity. On the contrary, paclitaxel further increased the turbidity in the assay system. Taken together, DATS altered the microtubule structure by acting as a microtubule-depolymerizing agent.Identification of DATS Modification Site in the Tubulin Molecule— Tubulin contains reactive sulfhydryl groups in its molecular structure (19Luduena R.F. Roach M.C. Pharmacol. Ther. 1991; 49: 133-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). To examine whether DATS directly reacted with the tubulin molecule, we digested both DATS-treated and native tubulin samples with trypsin and analyzed the digests by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Peptide mass mapping of the DATS-treated tubulin identified 28.8% of it as α-tubulin peptides and 40.0% as β-tubulin peptides. The DATS-modified β-tubulin peptide revealed an increase in mass by 72.1 Da, corresponding to the mass of a fragment molecule derived from DATS, S-allylmercaptocysteine, i.e. conversion of a protein sulfhydryl group (protein-SH) to an oxidized form by DATS (protein-SS-allyl). In the β-tubulin, evidence of cysteine residue modification was proved by the detection of peptide 3EIVHIQAGQCGNQIGAK10 ([M + 2H]2+ of m/z 919.65) and peptide 351TAVCDIPPR359 ([M + 2H]2+ of m/z 522.47; Fig. 6). Cys-12β and Cys-354β were identified as the residues that increased the peptide mass of 72.1 Da, suggesting that DATS-modified residues were included in the cysteine-containing peptide fragments. On the other hand, DATS-related modification of cysteine residues other than Cys-12β or Cys-354β could not be detected in either α- or β-tubulin (data not shown). These data suggest that among the tubulin structure, only 2 amino acid residues, Cys-12β and Cys-354β, are the specific amino acid residues oxidized by DATS. To examine the specificity further, we also measured the number of cysteine residues in the tubulin incubated with DATS by titrating the -SH group with 5,5′-dithiobis-2-nitrobenzoic acid. The number of -SH groups present in the tubulin was decreased from 20 to 18.5 by the incubation of tubulin with 10 μm DATS for 20 min. This result also supports the oxidation of two sulfhydryl groups by DATS at Cys-12β and Cys-354β as could be seen by mass spectrometry.FIGURE 6Analysis of the modification of tubulin by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A, collision-induced dissociation spectrum of the DATS-modified peptide ([M + 2H]2+ m/z 919.65) with the sequence3EIVHIQAGQCGNQIGAK19. The b ions (*b10 and *b12-16) and y ions (*y8-14 and *y16) were observed to increase 72.1 Da, suggesting that the DATS-oxidative modification site is in the sequence on cysteine 12 of β-tubulin.

https://openalex.org/W2039192244,"4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is one of the major end products of lipid peroxidation. It has been widely accepted that 4-HNE can induce oxidative stress, implicating into extensive stress-related diseases. In the present study, however, 4-HNE was found to exert adaptive cytoprotective effect at low concentrations, which was primarily through induction of thioredoxin reductase 1 (TR1) via transcriptional activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Pretreatment with 4-HNE at sublethal concentrations significantly protected PC12 cells against the subsequent oxidative cell death induced by H2O2 and 6-hydroxydopamine. The cellular antioxidative glutathione system did not show any considerable changes, whereas the TR1 activity as well as the mRNA level was significantly elevated by the 4-HNE treatment. Cells treated with TR1 small interfering RNA exhibited less resistance to oxidative stress, and the adaptive response was completely abolished. The Nrf2 was transcriptionally activated by 4-HNE. Cells treated with Nrf2-small interfering RNA exerted lower constitutive levels of TR1 and exhibited less resistance to oxidative stress, and the 4-HNE-induced TR1 expression and subsequent adaptive response were again abolished in such cells. Treatment with 4-HNE at the adaptive concentration induced transient activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and Akt/protein kinase B. Pharmacological inhibition of both these kinase pathways effectively attenuated 4-HNE-induced TR1 expression and subsequent adaptive protection. The above findings, taken together, suggest that stimulation with 4-HNE at sublethal concentrations induces adaptive response and enhances cell tolerance, primarily through induction of TR1 via transcriptional activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway, thereby protecting cells against the forthcoming oxidative stress. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is one of the major end products of lipid peroxidation.

Oxidative Stress. Academic Press, Ltd., London1985: 1-8Crossref Google Scholar). However, even if the level of stress is less than that of antioxidant capacity, stress functions as a signal to which the body responds irrespective of its level. When the stress level exceeds defense capacity, it may induce oxidative damage, whereas the low level stress may stimulate defense network and acts as a good stress, “eustress.” 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) 2The abbreviations used are: 4-HNE4-hydroxynonenalAREantioxidant response elementHO-1heme oxygenase-1Keap1kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1Nrf2NF-E2-related factor 26-OHDA6-hydroxydopamineROSreactive oxygen speciessiRNAsmall interfering RNATrxthioredoxinTRthioredoxin reductaseMTTdimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideRTreal timePBSphosphate-buffered saline.2The abbreviations used are: 4-HNE4-hydroxynonenalAREantioxidant response elementHO-1heme oxygenase-1Keap1kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1Nrf2NF-E2-related factor 26-OHDA6-hydroxydopamineROSreactive oxygen speciessiRNAsmall interfering RNATrxthioredoxinTRthioredoxin reductaseMTTdimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromideRTreal timePBSphosphate-buffered saline. is one of the major end products of lipid peroxidation and has been found to induce oxidative stress, as it is involved in the pathogenesis of a number of degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (2Sayre L.M.

Thus, it has been suggested that 4-HNE could act as a potential activator of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and induce the expression of phase II detoxification enzymes (13Ishii T. Itoh K. Ruiz E.

The transcription factor Nrf2 has been implicated as the central protein that interacts with the antioxidant response element (ARE) to activate gene transcription constitutively or in response to an oxidative stress signal (16Chan K. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12731-12736Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). Under homeostatic conditions, Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) binds to Nrf2 and facilitates the degradation of Nrf2 via the proteasome system (17Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D.

Upon stimulation, Nrf2 dissociates from its cytoplasmic inhibitor Keap1, translocates to the nucleus, and by heterodimerizing with a small Maf protein, transactivates the expression of ARE-dependent genes (18Alam J.

To date, three TR isozymes have been identified, predominantly cytosolic TR1, mitochondrial TR2, and the recently cloned TR3 (29Sun Q.A. Wu Y. Zappacosta F. Jeang K.T. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Gladyshev V.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24522-24530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Among these three isozymes of TR, TR1 is widely expressed and up-regulated by various stimuli and thought to take a prominent role in the cell defense against oxidative stress (30Nordberg J. Arner E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2118) Google Scholar). The detailed mechanisms by which TR1 is regulated have not been clearly clarified, and Nrf2 is considered to be one of the potential candidates (31Sakurai A. Nishimoto M. Himeno S. Imura N. Tsujimoto M. Kunimoto M. Hara S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Although 4-HNE at low concentrations has been suggested to take an important role in cell signal transduction, the detailed molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. In the present study we attempted to explore the possible adaptive response of 4-HNE in neuronal PC12 cells. We found that stimulation of PC12 cells with sublethal concentrations of 4-HNE induced adaptive response and protected cells against the subsequent oxidative stress, which was critically mediated through induction of TR1 via transcriptional activation of the Nrf2 signaling pathway. Materials—Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, horse serum, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen. NADPH was the product of Nacalai, Kyoto, Japan. Zinc protoporphyrin was purchased from Wako, Osaka, Japan. 4-HNE was from Calbiochem. 6-Hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), LY294002, and U0126 were obtained from Sigma. 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) was from Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan. Nrf2, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (p-ERK), and actin antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) antibody was purchased from Stressgen Biotechnologies. The antibody of phosphorylated Akt was product of Cell Signaling Technology. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with l-glutamine, sodium bicarbonate, and pyridoxine hydrochloride supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% horse serum. Cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Determination of Cell Viability—For determination the cell viability, the conventional MTT reduction assay was used. The treated cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml MTT in fresh medium at 37 °C for 1 h. Isopropyl alcohol containing 0.04 n HCl was added to the culture medium (3:2 by volume) and mixed with a pipette until the formazan was completely dissolved. The optical density of formazan was measured at 570 nm using a Multiskan Ascent plate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Preparation of the Cytosolic Fractions—The cytosolic fractions were prepared for the following TR1 enzyme assay, as described previously (32Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Akazawa T. Takahashi K. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39428-39434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). After treatment cells were harvested, and the cell pellets were suspended into 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer at pH 7.4 containing 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.7 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.25 m sucrose and followed by brief sonication. The cell homogenate was subjected to the ultracentrifugation at 105,000 × g for 60 min to obtain the cytosolic fractions. TR1 Assay—For the TR1 activity assay, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm NADPH, 0.8 μm human recombinant Trx, and 80 μm insulin were used as described previously (32Saito Y. Yoshida Y. Akazawa T. Takahashi K. Niki E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39428-39434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The oxidation of NADPH was recorded at 340 nm. The TR1 activity was calculated by nmol of oxidized NADPH/min and expressed as relative activity. Transfection of siRNA—Rat Nrf2- and TR1-siRNA were designed and manufactured by Invitrogen according to the current guidelines for effective knockdown by this method. The target sequences for Nrf2- and TR1-siRNA are 5′-UUU GAG UCU AAG GAG UUC AGC UGG C-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCC AGC UGA ACU CCU UAG ACU CAA A-3′ (reverse), and 5′-UUG UUG ACA GCU UUC GAA GUA GGC C-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGC CUA CUU CGA AAG CUG UCA ACA A-3′ (reverse), respectively. The siRNA was transfected into PC12 cells at a concentration of 20 pmol/105 cells by Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) 24 h before further experiments. Real Time (RT)-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan). cDNA synthesis was performed with a GeneAmp RNA PCR core kit (Applied Biosystems). Real time PCR was conducted using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems), and the PCR amplification was then detected with the SYBR Green I nucleic acid gel stain (Cambrex Bio Science Rockland, Inc., Rockland, ME). The housekeeping gene of rat GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was used as an endogenous control. The primers for amplification are: GAPDH, 5′-GGT GGA CCT CAT GGC CTA CAT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCC TCT CTC TTG CTC TCA GTA TCC T-3′ (reverse); TR1, 5′-CCT GCA GTA CTG AGT GGC GTT-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGA TCT GAG GGA GCC TCG TG-3′ (reverse). Western Blotting Analysis—Nuclear fractions or whole lysate of cells were prepared as described previously (33Chen Z.H. Hurh Y.J. Na H.K. Kim J.H. Chun Y.J. Kim D.H. Kang K.S. Cho M.H. Surh Y.J. Carcinogenesis. 2004; 25: 2005-2013Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The protein concentration was determined by using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Protein samples were solubilized with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer and electrophoresed on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in fresh blocking buffer (0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 5% nonfat dry milk). Dilutions of primary antibodies were made in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 3% nonfat dry milk. The blots were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the diluted primary antibody. After three washes with PBS and 0.1% Tween 20), the blots were incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in PBS with 3% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were again washed three times in PBS and 0.1% Tween 20 buffer, and the transferred proteins were incubated with ECL solution (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 min, in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions, and visualized on radiographic film. Statistics—All data of at least three independent experiments are expressed as the mean ± S.D. and analyzed by Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. 4-HNE Induced Adaptive Response in PC12 Cells—As an initial approach toward determining the possible adaptive response by 4-HNE in PC12 cells, the conventional MTT assay was used for monitoring the 4-HNE-induced cytotoxicity. At concentrations higher than 20 μm, 4-HNE significantly decreased the cell viability in PC12 cells (Fig. 1A). Based on the above observations, 20 μm was regarded as a quasi-toxicological threshold at which 4-HNE caused no appreciable cytotoxicity in PC12 cells, and concentrations below that were then selected for further studies to examine the possible adaptive effect of 4-HNE. Pretreatment with 15 μm 4-HNE for 24 h significantly protected PC12 cells against cell death induced by the subsequent treatment of H2O2 (Fig. 1B) or 6-OHDA (Fig. 1C), which both have been demonstrated to induce oxidative damage in neural system and are implicated in neuro-degenerative disorders (34Blum D. Torch S. Lambeng N. Nissou M. Benabid A.L. Sadoul R. Verna J.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2001; 65: 135-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 35Grunblatt E. Mandel S. Youdim M.B. J. Neurol. 2000; 247: 95-102Google Scholar). TR1 Was Responsible for the 4-HNE-induced Adaptive Response—We then attempted to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms responsible for such an adaptive response in PC12 cells. The cellular antioxidative glutathione system, including cellular glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, glutathione reductase, and total glutathione contents, did not show any considerable changes in cells treated with 15 μm 4-HNE for 24 h (data not shown), whereas the TR1 activity was significantly elevated by the treatment with sublethal concentrations of 4-HNE (Fig. 2A). The TR1 mRNA transcript was also significantly induced by 15 μm 4-HNE at initial time, with the maximum 5-fold increase peaked at 6 h (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the role of TR1 in the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response, the effect of TR1-siRNA was explored. PC12 cells treated with TR1-siRNA for 24 h exhibited a marked decline of the constitutive mRNA levels (∼28% of control, Fig. 2C) as well as the TR1 activity (∼60% of control, Fig. 2D), and the cells demonstrated a less resistance to oxidative stress (Fig. 2E). In such cells treated with TR1-siRNA, 4-HNE at 15 μm and 6-OHDA at 10 μm significantly decreased the cell viability, whereas in cells treated with nonspecific control RNA sample, they did not cause any appreciable cytotoxicity at the same concentrations (Fig. 2E). Moreover, the adaptive response was completely abolished in the TR1-siRNA-treated cells. Pretreatment of such cells with low concentrations of 4-HNE (5, 10, or 15 μm) did not induce any cytoprotection but even enhanced the cytotoxicity (Fig. 2F), indicating a pivotal role of TR1 in the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response. Pivotal Role of Nrf2 in the Induction of TR1 and in the Adaptive Response—The induction of TR1 may be regulated by several transcription factors, including Nrf2 (31Sakurai A. Nishimoto M. Himeno S. Imura N. Tsujimoto M. Kunimoto M. Hara S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 203: 529-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possible involvement of Nrf2 transcription pathway in the expression of TR1. The nuclear Nrf2 level was rapidly accumulated by the treatment of 15 μm 4-HNE (Fig. 3A), suggesting a possible involvement of the Nrf2 signaling pathway in the adaptive response. Cells treated with Nrf2-siRNA showed distinctly lower levels of constitutive Nrf2 protein (Fig. 3B) and lower TR1 mRNA transcript (∼80% that of control, Fig. 3C) as well as decreased TR1 activity (∼80% of control, Fig. 3D). Moreover, the 4-HNE-induced TR1 expression was completely abolished in cells treated with Nrf2-siRNA (Fig. 3E). In such cells 4-HNE at low concentrations (5, 10, or 15 μm) did not induce any considerable changes on the TR1 mRNA levels. All these findings strongly suggested a pivotal role of the Nrf2 transcription pathway in regulation of TR1 in PC12 cells. Similar to the effect of TR1-siRNA, treatment with Nrf2-siRNA also sensitized PC12 cells to the oxidative stress induced by 4-HNE or 6-OHDA, which both again caused higher cytotoxicity than they did in control cells (Fig. 3F). The adaptive response was abolished in such cells as well without any considerable protective effect by 4-HNE at low concentrations (Fig. 3G). Lesser Predominant Role of HO-1 in the Adaptive Response—The transcriptional activation of Nrf2 would evoke a series of phase II detoxifying enzymes, including HO-1, which is able to be induced by a wide variety of stimuli and protect cells against oxidative damage (36Alam J.

Treatment with 4-HNE at 15 μm for 24 h significantly induced the expression of HO-1 (Fig. 4A). However, the constitutive level of HO-1 only significantly declined in such cells treated with Nrf2-siRNA but did not show any considerable variations in cells treated with TR1-siRNA (Fig. 4B), in which the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response was completely abolished (Fig. 2F). In addition, zinc protoporphyrin, a pharmacological HO-1 inhibitor widely used in a variety of biosystems (41Choi B.M. Kim Y.M. Jeong Y.R. Pae H.O. Song C.E. Park J.E. Ahn Y.K. Chung H.T. Biochem.

Res. Commun. 2005; 331: 993-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar), only slightly but not significantly attenuated the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response (Fig. 4C). All these findings strongly suggested that, although HO-1 was induced by 4-HNE, it appeared to take a less predominant role in the 4-HNE-induced adaptive response. Role of Extracellular Signal-regulated Protein Kinase 1/2 and Akt/Protein Kinase B Signaling Pathways in the 4-HNE-induced Adaptive Response—The transcriptional activation of Nrf2 may be due to the direct Michael addition reaction with 4-HNE, which modified the thiol that resides in Keap1 and, consequently, liberated Nrf2 (13Ishii T.

Alternatively, it could also be regulated by several upstream protein kinase pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases, protein kinase C, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which modified either Keap1 or Nrf2 through phosphorylation and disassociated Nrf2 from Keap1 (15Numazawa S.

We then investigated the possible involvement of these kinases in the adaptive response. Cells treated with 15 μm 4-HNE transiently activated the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and Akt via phosphorylation, which both peaked at ∼60 min and slightly decreased thereafter (Fig. 5A). The 4-HNE-induced nuclear Nrf2 accumulation, TR1 mRNA expression, and adaptive protection were effectively attenuated by U0126 (25 μm) and LY294002 (10 μm) (Fig. 5, B–D), the pharmacologic inhibitor of MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which are upstream of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 and Akt. It has been widely accepted that low levels of H2O2 and the related reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles in the cell signal transduction (47Suh Y.A. Arnold R.S. Lassegue B. Shi J. Xu X. Sorescu D. Chung A.B. Griendling K.K. Lambeth J.D. Nature. 1999; 401: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar) and can induce adaptive response (48Demple B. Halbrook J.

Such roles of some other physiological oxidative stimuli or oxidation products in modulating and participating in signal transduction have received increased attention. For instance, cyclopentenone prostaglandins, which were derived from arachidonic acid via enzymatic conversion by cyclooxygenase and have been widely known to have proapoptotic effect in a variety of cell types (53Kim I.K.

A large number of DNA base modifications are formed by oxidative damage to DNA (for review, see Ref. 1Evans M.D. Dizdaroglu M. Cooke M.S. Mutat. Res. 2004; 567: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). Some of these lesions are generated at high rates, even in the absence of exogenous DNA-damaging agents. For instance, it was estimated that 100–500 8-hydroxyguanines (8-oxoGs) 3The abbreviations used are: 8-oxoG8-hydroxyguanine8-oxo-dG8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosineOGG1oxoguanine DNA glycosylaseNTH1endonuclease III homologueFapyG2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidineFapyA4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidineMe-FapyG2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidineMLMEmouse liver mitochondrial extractsMLNEmouse liver nuclear extractsTgthymine glycolWTwild typeLC/MSliquid chromatography/mass spectrometryGC/MSgas chromatography/mass spectrometry. are formed per day in a human cell (2Lindahl T.

However, ring-opened formamidopyrimidine lesions, 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyG) and 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyA), are formed at equal or higher levels than 8-oxoG after oxidative stress (3Dizdaroglu M.

These lesions result from hydroxyl radical attack on guanine and adenine, respectively, followed by one-electron reduction of the hydroxyl adduct radicals (1Evans M.D. Dizdaroglu M. Cooke M.S. Mutat. Res. 2004; 567: 1-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar), which are also intermediates in the formation of 8-oxoG and 8-oxoA (6Candeias L.P. Steenken S. Chemistry. 2000; 6: 475-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Formation of Fapy lesions in DNA upon UV radiation has also been reported (7Doetsch P. Zastawny T. Martin A. Dizdaroglu M.

Soc. 2002; 124: 7278-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) are miscoding in vitro, both directing the preferential misincorporation of adenine opposite the lesions by a bacterial DNA polymerase (Klenow exo-). Experiments using the methylated analogue of FapyG, i.e. 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-N-methylformamidopyrimidine (Me-FapyG), have suggested that formamidopyrimidines might also constitute blocks to DNA polymerases (10Graziewicz M.A. Zastawny T.H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 14589-14597Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that FapyG and FapyA are chemically distinct from Me-FapyG. FapyG and FapyA are formed from purines in DNA by oxidative attack or UV radiation, whereas Me-FapyG is the product of alkylation damage to guanine in DNA. Consequently, any results obtained with Me-FapyG should not be directly extrapolated to FapyG or FapyA. Oxidative DNA damage is primarily repaired by the base excision repair pathway. Base excision repair is initiated by a DNA glycosylase that recognizes the modified base and hydrolyzes the N-glycosidic bond. Repair then proceeds through the coordinated actions of an abasic site endonuclease, DNA polymerase, and DNA ligase (12Wilson D.M. II I. Sofinowski T.M. McNeill D.R. Front Biosci. 2003; 8: d963-d981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Numerous DNA glycosylases have been identified in mammals, and although they show distinct substrate specificities, there is a considerable degree of overlap, most notably among DNA glycosylases that repair oxidative DNA damage (for review, see Ref. 13Dizdaroglu M. Mutat. Res. 2003; 531: 109-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Studies with purified enzymes from various sources have identified several glycosylases that can release FapyG and FapyA from irradiated DNA, such as the bacterial Fpg, Nei, and Nth; the yeast, plant, and mammalian oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1); and the recently identified human and mouse homologues of Escherichia coli endonuclease VIII (Nei) (NEIL1) (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Jaruga P. Birincioglu M.

However, to date, no study has directly addressed repair of FapyG and FapyA in cellular extracts from mammalian cells. Synthetic single lesion oligonucleotide constructs have been instrumental for the understanding of repair pathways for modified DNA bases (16Wang D. Kreutzer D.A. Essigmann J.M. Mutat. Res. 1998; 400: 99-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). A method for the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing FapyG and FapyA at defined sites was recently developed (17Haraguchi K.

Here, we have reported the first study of the repair of FapyG and FapyA in these oligonucleotides, using nuclear and mitochondrial extracts of wild type and mice deficient in the two major glycosylases for the repair of oxidative DNA damage, OGG1 and NTH1. We determined the endogenous levels of FapyA, FapyG, and 8-oxoG in genomic DNA from wild type mice and found that FapyG levels are significantly higher than 8-oxoG. Our results showed that FapyG is repaired mainly by OGG1, both in nucleus and in mitochondria. NTH1 is the major glycosylase for the repair of FapyA. We found significantly higher levels of FapyG and FapyA in DNA from the knock-out mice, emphasizing the biological significance of OGG1 and NTH1 in the repair of these lesions.

The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h and stopped with the addition of 5 μg of proteinase K and 1 μl of 10% SDS followed by 30 min of incubation at 55 °C. To promote complete strand cleavage at the abasic sites, 100 mm NaOH was added and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min. An equal amount of formamide loading dye was added, and the samples were incubated at 90 °C for 5 min and resolved by electrophoresis on a 20% polyacrylamide/7 m urea gel. Gels were visualized by PhosphorImager and analyzed using the ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). The percentage of incision was calculated as the amount of radioactivity present in the product band relative to the total radioactivity and converted into fmol of substrate incised. Incision of 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide was performed as described above, except that 89 fmol of substrate were used. Incision of FapyA- and Tg-containing oligonucleotides was carried out using 150 and 250 fmol of substrate, respectively. The experiments were processed as described above, without incubation with NaOH. DNA Trapping Assay—DNA trapping assays were performed as described for the glycosylase assay, with the addition of 50 mm NaBH4. After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the reactions were terminated by adding 5 μl of 5× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Trapped protein-DNA complexes were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE. The gels were visualized using PhosphorImager. Preparation of Total DNA from Mouse Liver—Genomic DNA was isolated using a modification of the salting-out method. Half of freshly removed livers were chopped and homogenized in 2 ml of buffer containing 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.4, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.75 mm spermidine. The homogenates were then diluted in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, 2 mm EDTA, 400 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, and 2 mg/ml proteinase K and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h to promote cell lysis. One-forth volume of saturated NaCl was added, and the samples were incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. After a brief incubation in ice, proteins were precipitated by centrifugation at 16,100 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was recovered, and the DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volumes of 96% ethanol overnight at -20 °C. The precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation, suspended in 5 ml of 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA and incubated with RNaseA (0.1 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h. The samples were then subjected to another proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) digestion in lysis buffer at 55 °C for 3 h. After precipitation in ice and centrifugation as above, DNA was precipitated from the supernatant with ethanol, dried, and suspended in water. Analysis by Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (LC/MS) and Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS—LC/MS was used to identify and quantify 8-oxoG as its nucleoside 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) in DNA samples isolated from WT and knock-out mice. Fifty μg of DNA were supplemented with 5 pmol of 8-oxo-dG-15N5 as an internal standard. DNA samples were hydrolyzed with nuclease P1, snake venom phosphodiesterase, and alkaline phosphatase for 24 h and then analyzed by LC/MS as described in Ref. 22Jaruga P. Theruvathu J. Dizdaroglu M. Brooks P.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: e87Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar. For identification and quantification, selected-ion monitoring was used to monitor the characteristic ions of 8-oxo-dG (m/z 168 and 306) and 8-oxo-dG-15N5 (m/z 173 and 311) (23Dizdaroglu M. Jaruga P. Rodriguez H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 30: 774-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The identification and quantification of FapyG and FapyA in DNA was performed by GC/MS following hydrolysis by E. coli Fpg (isolated as described in Ref. 24Reddy P. Jaruga P. O'Connor T. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Fifty μg of DNA were supplemented with 8 pmol of FapyA-13C,15N2 and 8 pmol of FapyG-13C,15N2 as internal standards and then hydrolyzed with 2 μg of Fpg. Following ethanol precipitation, DNA pellets and supernatant fractions were separated by centrifugation. Supernatant fractions were lyophilized, trimethylsilylated, and analyzed by GC/MS as described (24Reddy P. Jaruga P. O'Connor T. Rodriguez H. Dizdaroglu M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For identification and quantification, selected-ion monitoring was used to monitor the characteristic ions of trimethylsilylated FapyA and FapyG and their stable isotope-labeled analogues (25Dizdaroglu M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 315: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Endogenous Levels of FapyG and FapyA in Mouse Liver DNA—Formamidopyrimidine levels in cellular DNA have previously been determined only in mice subjected to γ-irradiation (4Mori T. Hori Y. Dizdaroglu M. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1993; 64: 645-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We determined background levels of 8-oxoG, FapyA, and FapyG in liver DNA from 4–6-month-old WT mice (Fig. 1). Levels of 8-oxoG and FapyA were quite similar, ∼1 lesion/106 nucleotides. FapyG levels, on the other hand, were significantly higher than 8-oxoG and FapyA, at about 6.5 lesions/106 nucleotides. Jaruga et al. (26Jaruga P. Speina E. Gackowski D. Tudek B. Olinski R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: E16Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) also found FapyG levels to be higher than 8-oxoG levels in rat liver DNA. Excision of FapyG in Liver Mitochondria—Mitochondria are the major cellular source of reactive oxygen species, and the mitochondrial DNA has been shown to be subjected to higher oxidative damage than nuclear DNA (27Hudson E.K. Hogue B.A. Souza-Pinto N.C. Croteau D.L. Anson R.M. Bohr V.A. Hansford R.G. Free Radic. Res. 1998; 29: 573-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We investigated how FapyG and FapyA are repaired in mammalian mitochondria using mouse liver mitochondrial extracts (MLME) from WT and knock-out mice for OGG1 and NTH1, the two major DNA glycosylases responsible for repairing oxidative base lesions. These extracts were free of nuclear contamination, as assessed by Western blot (Supplemental Fig. 2) against Lamin B2, an abundant nuclear matrix protein. Cytochrome oxidase subunit IV was used as a marker for mitochondrial content. MLME extracts from WT mice incised the FapyG-containing oligonucleotide in a protein concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2A and Supplemental Fig. 3), with the reaction reaching saturation between 25 and 100 μg of extract. MLME from NTH1-/- mice showed only slightly less incision at lower protein concentrations but similar incision efficiency with more than 25 μg of extract. Extracts from OGG1-/- mice had significantly less incision of the FapyG-containing substrate, and extracts from (OGG1/NTH1)-/- mice showed very limited incision, only detectable at very high protein concentrations. DNA glycosylases that catalyze β-elimination reaction form Schiff base intermediates with the substrate, which can be covalently trapped in the presence of NaBH4 (28Sun B. Latham K.A. Dodson M.L. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we detected the formation of substrate-enzyme complexes in MLME from WT, OGG1-/-, and NTH1-/- mice but not in extract from the double knock-out (Fig. 2B). We observed two closely migrating bands in the WT extracts. OGG1 and NTH1 knock-out extracts showed only one band each, corresponding to the two bands observed in the WT. The band in NTH1-/- extract co-migrated with recombinant OGG1 (lane 6). These results suggest that both OGG1 and NTH1 can form covalent intermediates with a FapyG-containing substrate. However, the results presented in Fig. 2A suggest that OGG1 is the major DNA glycosylase for FapyG in mouse liver mitochondria and that NTH1 plays only a secondary role. The small residual incision observed with extracts from the double knock-out mice suggests that another DNA glycosylase may play a minor role in FapyG repair in liver mitochondria. We previously showed that OGG1 is likely the only DNA glycosylase for removal of 8-oxoG from mtDNA (29Souza-Pinto N.C. Eide L. Hogue B.A. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Bohr V.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5378-5381PubMed Google Scholar). Since steady-state levels of FapyG in DNA in vivo are higher than those of 8-oxoG (Fig. 1), we compared the kinetics of base excision by WT MLME for FapyG- and 8-oxoG-contaning substrates (Fig. 2C). Because of technical limitations, we had to use different amounts of each substrate; thus, incision activity is presented as the percentage of substrate cleaved instead of fmol of product generated. Under saturating conditions (excess substrate), FapyG incision activity was about 2-fold higher than that of 8-oxoG. Cleavage of both lesions was greatly decreased in extracts from OGG1 knock-out mice (Fig. 2D). However, OGG1-/- extracts still retained some FapyG incision, once again indicating that another DNA glycosylase may participate in FapyG repair in the absence of OGG1. Excision of FapyA in Liver Mitochondria—We next investigated the repair of FapyA lesions in mitochondrial extracts. FapyA-containing oligonucleotides were incised by WT MLME in a protein-dependent manner (Fig. 3A and Supplemental Fig. 4). Similar incision activity was observed for extracts from OGG1-/- mice. In contrast, NTH1-/- and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- extracts showed a significant decrease in incision activity with protein concentrations higher than 50 μg. There was no difference in activity between the two latter extracts. This suggests that NTH1 is the major glycosylase for FapyA removal in mitochondrial extracts and that OGG1 most likely does not participate in this process. In agreement with the incision results, we observed trapped DNA/enzyme complexes in WT and OGG1-/- but not in NTH1-/- and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- extracts (Fig. 3B). FapyA incision in NTH1-/- and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- was comparable with WT at lower protein concentrations, indicating that another DNA glycosylase may partially compensate for the absence of NTH1. However, we did not detect any additional trapped band in NTH1-/- extracts with sodium borohydride (lines 2 and 4). Tgs are repaired in mouse liver mitochondria solely by NTH1 (30Karahalil B. Souza-Pinto N.C. Parsons J.L. Elder R.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33701-33707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Thus, we compared excision efficiency of FapyA and Tg. WT extracts incised the FapyA-containing substrate with similar efficiency as that of a substrate containing Tg (Fig. 3C). In support of a major role for NTH1 in the removal of these two lesions in liver mitochondria, incision activity for both lesions was greatly reduced in NTH1-/- extracts, although Tg incision activity was lower than FapyA incision (Fig. 3D). Detection of NEIL1 in Liver Mitochondria—The observation that mitochondrial extracts from (OGG1/NTH1)-/- still retained a limited excision activity toward FapyG- or FapyA-containing substrates suggested the existence of another DNA glycosylase recognizing those lesions. Recently, Fpg mammalian homologues have been identified, and three new DNA glycosylases, NEIL (for nei-like)-1, 2, and 3, have been cloned (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W.

Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The substrate specificity of human and mouse NEIL1 proteins indicate that FapyA and FapyG are preferred substrates (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rosenquist T.A. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). NEIL1 has been identified as the backup glycosylase for oxidized pyrimidines in nuclear extracts from NTH1-/- mice (34Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Thus, NEIL1 is a likely candidate for the residual incision activity we detected in mitochondria from the double-knock-out mice. However, to date, none of the NEIL glycosylases have been localized to mitochondria. We investigated whether liver mitochondria contain NEIL1 by Western blot, with recombinant human NEIL1 (hNEIL1) as a positive control (Fig. 4). NEIL1 was detected, at similar levels, in both WT and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- MLME, indicating that this glycosylase is present in mouse mitochondria and thus could account for the residual excision activity we observed in the absence of OGG1 and NTH1. Excision of FapyG/FapyA in Liver Nuclei—We next investigated the excision of FapyG- and FapyA-containing substrates by liver nuclear extracts (MLNE) from the same knock-out mice used for preparation of mitochondria. FapyG was excised with similar efficiency by nuclear extracts from WT and NTH1-/- (Fig. 5A and supplemental Fig. 5). A significant reduction in incision was observed with MLNE from OGG1-/-, demonstrating a major role for OGG1 in FapyG repair in the nucleus. Although we did not observe any difference in incision activity in WT and NTH1-/-, the small decrease in extracts from (OGG1/NTH1)-/- mice when compared with OGG1-/- alone (Fig. 5A) may imply that, similar to what we observed in the mitochondrial extracts, NTH1 plays a minor role in FapyG removal in the nucleus in the absence of OGG1. FapyA was also efficiently incised by WT MLNE (Fig. 5B), but incision was very limited in extracts from NTH1-/-. No additional decrease in activity was observed in (OGG1/NTH1)-/- MLNE, suggesting that OGG1 does not participate in the repair of FapyA in the nucleus, as we observed in mitochondria. On the other hand, FapyA incision was more efficient in OGG1-/- extracts than in WT (Fig. 5B, triangle symbols), suggesting a possible up-regulation of one or more DNA glycosylases in the OGG1-/- background. FapyA is an efficient substrate for both NTH1 and NEIL1, and our previous data established a role for NTH1 in FapyA repair in vivo. To determine whether NEIL1 could also contribute to the repair of FapyA in vivo, we measured FapyA incision in whole cell extracts from heart, liver, and spleen of WT and knock-out mice (Fig. 5C) because the relative expression of these two glycosylases is known to vary significantly among different mouse tissues (34Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In heart, NEIL1 is expressed at a significantly higher level than NTH1; in liver, NTH1 is more abundant than NEIL1, and in spleen, similar mRNA levels for both glycosylases have been detected (34Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). FapyA incision by whole cell extracts from liver, heart, and spleen from WT and knock-out mice showed a striking correlation with the mRNA levels determined by Takao et al. (34Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar); incision activity was significantly decreased in liver whole cell extracts lacking NTH1 (from NTH1-/- and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- mice) but only slightly lower in heart from these animals. Spleen whole cell extracts from mice lacking NTH1 (NTH1-/- and (OGG1/NTH1)-/-) had about 50% of WT incision. Not surprisingly, these results suggested that the contribution of each glycosylase for the repair of FapyA (and perhaps FapyG) depends largely on their relative expression levels. Detection of Oxidized DNA Bases in Genomic DNA from Knock-out Mice—One prediction ensuing from the above results is that mice lacking OGG1 and/or NTH1 would accumulate Fapy lesions in their DNA. We tested this hypothesis by measuring levels of FapyG (Fig. 6B) and of FapyA and 8-oxoG (Fig. 6A) in liver genomic DNA from OGG1-/-, NTH1-/-, and (OGG1/NTH1)-/- mice (Fig. 6). The levels of these lesions in WT mice shown in Fig. 1 are presented here again to facilitate comparison with the knock-out mice. DNA from NTH1-/- mice had significantly higher levels of both FapyA (Fig. 6A) and FapyG (Fig. 6B) than the WT, consistent with our observation that NTH1 is the major DNA glycosylase for FapyA and may also contribute to the removal of FapyG. In contrast, DNA from OGG1 knock-out mice had significantly higher levels of 8-oxoG and FapyG, but not FapyA, again, in agreement with the incision data. DNA from the double knock-out mice had significantly higher levels of all three modified bases. We have shown here that FapyG accumulates in mouse liver DNA at much higher levels than 8-oxoG, which is considered a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage. Since Fapy lesions have been shown to be miscoding and/or blockers of polymerases (9Wiederholt C.J. Greenberg M.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 7278-7279Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 35Tudek B. Graziewicz M. Kazanova O. Zastawny T.H. Obtulowicz T. Laval J. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1999; 46: 785-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 36Tudek B. J. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 36: 12-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), their efficient repair is necessary for stability of both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes. The vast majority of the previous studies on the repair of formamidopyrimidines used either a Me-FapyG analogue or γ-irradiated DNA, which contains numerous oxidatively induced DNA modifications. In this study, we investigated the repair of Fapy lesions by mitochondrial and nuclear extracts using oligonucleotides containing a single FapyG or FapyA. We have shown that both lesions are efficiently repaired in mouse liver mitochondria and nuclei. FapyG is excised with higher efficiency than 8-oxoG in mitochondrial extracts from WT mice, and FapyA is repaired with the same efficiency as thymine glycol lesions. Furthermore, we have shown that FapyG, FapyA, and 8-oxoG accumulate in liver DNA from knock-out mice lacking OGG1 and NTH1, underscoring the biological role of these glycosylases in the repair of formamidopyrimidines. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the specific removal of formamidopyrimidines from DNA using mammalian cell extracts. We found that FapyG is preferentially removed by OGG1, both in mitochondria and in nuclei. In a minor role, NTH1 can also participate in FapyG repair, especially if opposite G (not shown), a base composition that could be formed by the misincorporation of Gs opposite FapyG during DNA replication occurs. Equivalently, purified E. coli endonuclease III removed both FapyA and FapyG from DNA, although FapyA was excised more rapidly (37Wiederholt C.J. Patro J.N. Jiang Y.L. Haraguchi K. Greenberg M.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3331-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The small contribution of NTH1 to FapyG repair was also confirmed by the presence of a sodium borohydride-trapped DNA-enzyme complex in extracts from OGG1-/- liver mitochondria not seen in extracts from (OGG1/NTH1)-/- animals and by the elevated levels of FapyG in liver genomic DNA from NTH1-/- mice. On the other hand, we did not find any evidence that OGG1 can act upon FapyA in mitochondrial or nuclear extracts. This is in agreement with the observation that purified human OGG1 (hOGG1) does not release FapyA lesions from γ-irradiated DNA (38Dherin C. Radicella J.P. Dizdaroglu M. Boiteux S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4001-4007Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Although a significant percentage of the incision activity against FapyG and FapyA was lost in extracts from the double knock-out mice lacking OGG1 and NTH1, we consistently observed some residual incision activity, both in mitochondrial and in nuclear extracts, suggesting that another glycosylase could contribute to the incision activity. The newly identified human and mouse NEIL1 proteins efficiently excise FapyG and FapyA from γ-irradiated DNA in vitro (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 15Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rosenquist T.A. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), making them likely candidates for this residual activity. It has been previously suggested that NEIL1 (33Morland I. Rolseth V. Luna L. Rognes T. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4926-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) and NEIL2 (31Hazra T.K. Kow Y.W. Hatahet Z. Imhoff B. Boldogh I. Mokkapati S.K. Mitra S. Izumi T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30417-30420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) localize exclusively to the nucleus. However, our results have shown for the first time that NEIL1 is also found in mouse liver mitochondria and thus could account for the residual incision observed in the double knock-out extracts. It is of importance to determine the relative contribution of each DNA glycosylase to the repair of one particular lesion in the whole cell, where all enzymes are present and likely competing for the substrate. We addressed this question with regards to FapyA incision using whole cell extracts from tissues with different expressions of NTH1 and NEIL1. Our results suggested that the relative expression level of each protein strongly impacts their contribution to the overall repair efficiency. Both NEIL1 (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and NTH1 (39Luna L. Bjoras M. Hoff E. Rognes T. Seeberg E. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) mRNA levels increase in early-mid S phase, suggesting a role for both glycosylases in replication-associated repair. However, their tissue-specific expression patterns are quite distinct, with NTH1 being highly expressed in lung and testis and NEIL1 being highly expressed in heart and spleen. Thus, it is possible that these two glycosylases display overlapping biological roles in different tissues. Another possibility is that their biological roles are differentiated on the basis of post-translational modifications. For example, OGG1 serine-phosphorylation by protein kinase C modulates its intracellular localization (40Dantzer F. Luna L. Bjoras M. Seeberg E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 2349-2357Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), whereas its serine/threonine phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4) modulates its catalytic properties (41Hu J. Imam S.Z. Hashiguchi K. Souza-Pinto N.C. Bohr V.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 3271-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that mouse liver mitochondria contain NEIL1, as originally suggested by Hazra et al. (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 3523-3528Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and Takao et al. (34Takao M. Kanno S. Kobayashi K. Zhang Q.M. Yonei S. van der Horst G.T. Yasui A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42205-42213Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) can function as a backup activity for 8-oxoG and thymine glycol repair. However, we previously showed that in mouse liver mitochondria, 8-oxoG is repaired solely by OGG1 protein (29Souza-Pinto N.C. Eide L. Hogue B.A. Thybo T. Stevnsner T. Seeberg E. Klungland A. Bohr V.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 5378-5381PubMed Google Scholar) and that thymine glycol lesions are repaired solely by NTH1 (30Karahalil B. Souza-Pinto N.C. Parsons J.L. Elder R.H. Bohr V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33701-33707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We confirmed our previous results in this study, and additionally, we showed that in the absence of OGG1 or NTH1, mitochondrial extracts can still excise some FapyG and FapyA, respectively. Together, our results suggested that NEIL1 may function as a backup glycosylase for Fapys in mouse mitochondria but not for 8-oxoG and Tg removal. More recent studies failed to detect 8-oxoG excision by recombinant human (14Hazra T.K. Izumi T. Boldogh I. Imhoff B. Kow Y.W. Jaruga P. Dizdaroglu M. Mitra S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DNA Repair. 2003; 2: 581-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and mouse NEIL1 (15Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rosenquist T.A. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and showed a much lower efficiency for the excision of Tg in comparison with FapyG/FapyA by mouse NEIL1 (15Jaruga P. Birincioglu M. Rosenquist T.A. Dizdaroglu M. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15909-15914Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). These results with purified enzymes supported our conclusion that NEIL1 does not participate in the repair of 8-oxoG and Tg in mouse mitochondria. This study has shown for the first time that formamidopyrimidines are efficiently repaired in cellular extracts and that OGG1 and NTH1 play major roles in this process. The results have also indicated that NEIL1 may participate in base excision repair of formamidopyrimidines, particularly in tissues in which it is highly expressed. Our results strongly suggested that Fapy lesions are physiological substrates of these enzymes and that these lesions may be important oxidized DNA modifications leading to mutagenicity and cytotoxicity.

https://openalex.org/W2068191984,"The steroid hormone aldosterone stimulates sodium (Na+) transport in tight epithelia by altering the expression of target genes that regulate the activity and trafficking of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). We performed microarray analysis to identify aldosterone-regulated transcripts in mammalian kidney epithelial cells (mpkC-CDc14). One target, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ), was previously identified by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE); however, its function in epithelial ion transport was unknown. Here we show that GILZ expression is rapidly stimulated by aldosterone in mpkCCDc14 and that GILZ, in turn, strongly stimulates ENaC-mediated Na+ transport by inhibiting extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling. In Xenopus oocytes with activated ERK, heterologous GILZ expression consistently inhibited phospho-ERK expression and markedly stimulated ENaC-mediated Na+ current, in a manner similar to that of U0126 (a pharmacologic inhibitor of ERK signaling). In mpkCCDc14 cells, GILZ transfection similarly consistently inhibited phospho-ERK expression and stimulated transepithelial Na+ transport. Furthermore, aldosterone treatment of mpkCCDc14 cells suppressed phospho-ERK levels with a time course that paralleled their increase of Na+ transport. Finally, GILZ expression markedly increased cell surface ENaC expression in epidermal growth factor-treated mammalian kidney epithelial cells, HEK 293. These observations suggest a novel link between GILZ and regulation of epithelial sodium transport through modulation of ERK signaling and could represent an important pathway for mediating aldosterone actions in health and disease.

These observations suggest a novel link between GILZ and regulation of epithelial sodium transport through modulation of ERK signaling and could represent an important pathway for mediating aldosterone actions in health and disease. Hormone-regulated sodium (Na+) transport in tight epithelia is essential for the control of circulatory volume, blood pressure, and extracellular fluid composition in vertebrates.

Bhargava A. Cole T.J. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Several studies using candidate gene approaches (2Verrey F. Schaerer E. Zoerkler P. Paccolat M.P.

As with other steroid-regulated processes (9King-Jones K. Thummel C.S. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2005; 6: 311-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), two major classes of target genes have been identified: early and late. Early response genes appear to be required for initiation of the response, whereas the late response genes participate in consolidation (10Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: F319-F327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter include components of the ion transport machinery itself (for example, ENaC subunits and subunits of the Na,K-ATPase) and genes that encode regulatory proteins that likely act to limit the extent of the aldosterone response (for example, activators of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) or its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (11Grossmann C. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Krug A.W. Gekle M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The former category encodes primarily signaling molecules, implicated in pathways that control ENaC activity and/or trafficking (1Pearce D. Bhargava A. Cole T.J. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The best characterized of these targets is the serine-threonine kinase serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase-1 (SGK1) (1Pearce D. Bhargava A. Cole T.J. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which acts to increase apical membrane ENaC, at least in part, by inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4–2, itself a modulator of ENaC trafficking and degradation (12Snyder P.M.

Recently, several lines of evidence have suggested that aldosterone-regulated mediators other than SGK1 provide stimulatory input into this system (1Pearce D. Bhargava A. Cole T.J. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Most notably, although SGK1 knock-out mice have aldosterone resistance, their phenotype is substantially less severe than that of either mineralocorticoid receptor or αENaC knock-out mice (1Pearce D. Bhargava A. Cole T.J. Vitam. Horm. 2003; 66: 29-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 14Wulff P. Vallon V. Huang D.Y. Volkl H. Yu F. Richter K. Jansen M. Schlunz M. Klingel K. Loffing J.

Feraille E. Kaissling B. Asher C. Rossier B.C. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that renal ENaC function and renal mineralocorticoid action are partially but not completely dependent on SGK1. The observation that short term aldosterone treatment induces an accumulation of SGK1 in the entire aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, whereas the apical insertion of ENaC takes place only in the connecting tubule and early collecting duct, indicates that other factors are probably required as well to drive ENaC cell surface expression and activity and, thus, Na+ reabsorption (15Loffing J. Zecevic M. Feraille E. Kaissling B. Asher C. Rossier B.C. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Verrey F. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 675-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is also notable that inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (which is responsible for activation of SGK1) do not completely abolish aldosterone-induced Na+ transport (16Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 303-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting the idea that aldosterone may act through multiple pathways to stimulate Na+ reabsorption, some of which are SGK1- and phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase-independent. Other regulators, including K-Ras (17Staruschenko A. Patel P. Tong Q. Medina J.L. Stockand J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37771-37778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and KS-WNK1 (18Naray-Fejes-Toth A. Snyder P.M. Fejes-Toth G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17434-17439Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), have been identified and shown to stimulate Na+ transport; however, aldosterone regulation has not been demonstrated in animals, and their physiological importance has not yet been established. The broad aim of the present study, therefore, was to identify and characterize key genes (other than SGK1) that stimulate ENaC-mediated Na+ transport and mediate the early response to aldosterone. Toward this end, we performed microarray analysis in the aldosterone-responsive cortical collecting duct (CCD) cell line, mpkCCDc14, which exhibit typical electrophysiologic features of a tight epithelium, express functional ENaC, and respond to aldosterone (1 μm) with increased amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents (19Vandewalle A. Bens M. Duong Van Huyen J.P. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1999; 8: 581-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This manuscript and associated additional data deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data base (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo) report the results of this screen and characterization of one up-regulated transcript, glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper protein (GILZ). This corticosteroid early response gene was identified previously as an aldosterone-regulated transcript by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and shown to be rapidly and robustly stimulated by aldosterone in mpkCCDc14 cells (5Robert-Nicoud M. Flahaut M. Elalouf J.M. Nicod M. Salinas M. Bens M. Doucet A. Wincker P. Artiguenave F. Horisberger J.D. Vandewalle A. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2712-2716Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) as well as in native CCD (20Muller O.G. Parnova R.G. Centeno G. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. Horisberger J.D. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). However, it has not been shown to stimulate (or inhibit) Na+ current, and a role in epithelial ion transport has not been established. In addition to its early marked induction by aldosterone, two independent lines of evidence suggested that GILZ might represent an important mediator of aldosterone action in collecting duct cells. 1) GILZ has been found to act as an inhibitor of ERK1/2 signaling in T-lymphocytes (21Ayroldi E. Zollo O. Macchiarulo A. Di Marco B. Marchetti C. Riccardi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7929-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In this context, GILZ interacted with and blocked activation of Raf, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase implicated in ERK1/2 activation. 2) ERK activation, for example by EGF (in cultured CD cells) (11Grossmann C. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Krug A.W. Gekle M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 22Falin R. Veizis I.E. Cotton C.U. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) or by progesterone (in ENaC-expressing oocytes) (23Nicod M. Michlig S. Flahaut M. Salinas M. Fowler Jaeger N. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5109-5117Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), inhibits Na+ current and has been suggested to serve as a late brake, providing feedback inhibition to limit aldosterone-stimulatory effects (11Grossmann C. Freudinger R. Mildenberger S. Krug A.W. Gekle M. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 286: 1226-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, along these same lines, although short term (<1 h) blockade of ERK activation with pharmacologic inhibitors diminishes Na+ current in CD cells (24Michlig S. Mercier A. Doucet A. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51002-51012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), longer term (>4 h) inhibition stimulates it (22Falin R. Veizis I.E. Cotton C.U. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2005; 288: 1003-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 25Shen J.P. Cotton C.U. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2003; 284: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Finally, in contrast to other nephron segments, ERK1/2 appears to be constitutively active in distal nephron cells (24Michlig S. Mercier A. Doucet A. Schild L. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Firsov D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51002-51012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Andreucci M. Michael A. Kramers C. Park K.M. Chen A. Matthaeus T. Alessandrini A. Haq S.

Nephrol. 2004; 15: 1835-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), consistent with tonic inhibition of Na+ transport by the ERK pathway. Taken together, the above observations suggested that GILZ might function as a mineralocorticoid-induced inhibitor of ERK signaling implicated in the early induction of ENaC-mediated Na+ transport. We, therefore, examined its ability to inhibit ERK1/2 and stimulate Na+ current in oocytes and cultured cells. Cell Culture and Electrophysiological Measurements—mpkCCDc14 cells were maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks in a modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1) medium (regular medium) as described previously (16Wang J. Barbry P. Maiyar A.C. Rozansky D.J. Bhargava A. Leong M. Firestone G.L. Pearce D. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2001; 280: 303-313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, the cells were seeded and grown in regular medium on collagen-coated filters (Transwell, pore-size 0.4 μm, Corning Costar) until the cell monolayers reached transepithelial resistance greater than 1000 ohms-cm2. They were then maintained in hormone-free, serum-free medium (29Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for at least 24 h before treatment with aldosterone (10–6 m, apical and basolateral sides) or equal volumes of vehicle as the control for specified periods of time. After electrophysiological measurements, cells were harvested and processed for RNA or protein analysis. For the EGF experiments, cell monolayers exhibiting high transepithelial resistance were maintained (for 72 h) in modified medium supplemented with 1× serum substitute (Celox Laboratories, Inc.) (medium deprived of growth factors (including EGF), mitogens, insulin, transferrin, and dexamethasone) and then treated with EGF (Sigma; 20 ng/ml; apical and basolateral sides) or U0126 (Cell Signaling; 10 μm; apical and basolateral sides) for a period of 24 h. Some groups were pretreated with U0126 for 2 h before EGF treatment. All experiments were performed in parallel with appropriate vehicle controls (aldosterone was dissolved in ethanol; U0126 was dissolved in Me2SO). Transepithelial resistance and potential difference across the cell monolayers were measured using a mini-volt-ohmmeter (MilliCell ERS, Millipore) at specified time periods after treatment. The equivalent short circuit current (Ieq) was calculated using Ohm's law (29Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amiloride (1 μm) added to the medium completely inhibited this current, thereby indicating its ENaC dependence (data not shown). The use of equivalent current as a surrogate for true short circuit current for our specific purposes is well established (30Bhargava A. Fullerton M.J. Myles K. Purdy T.M. Funder J.W. Pearce D. Cole T.J. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 1587-1594Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 31Pearce D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 12: 341-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from aldosterone- or vehicle-treated cells (after electrophysiological measurements, as above) using standard procedures and made free of residual genomic DNA contamination using the DNase treatment and removal kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Microarray analysis was performed after the protocol recommended by the University of California at San Franscisco Genomics Core Laboratories (the original document can be found at www.arrays.ucsf.edu). Briefly, first strand cDNA was synthesized with 20 μg of total RNA, 1 μg of oligo dT, 830 μm each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 166 μm dTTP, 666 μm 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (Ambion), 0.1 m dithiothreitol, 1 μl of RNase inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences), 600 units of RT (Promega Corp.), 10× RT buffer, and diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water to a final volume of 30 μl for 2 h at 42 °C. After hydrolysis with 10 μl of 1 n NaOH and 10 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, cDNA was purified and recovered using Microcon 30 (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences) was then coupled with cDNA in 0.05 m NaHCO3 (pH 9.0) in the dark at room temperature for more than 1.5 h. After clean-up with CyScribe GFX purification kit (Amersham Biosciences), the labeled cDNA was hybridized with the microarray slide at 50 °C for >40 h. Arrays were printed by University of California at San Franscisco Genomics Core Laboratories using 40-mer oligo library (Qiagen, Valencia, CA; Mouse Version 2.0). Data were collected using Genepix 4.0 scanner. Array Data Analysis—After array hybridization and scanning, quality of the array was examined with RBioconductor. First, the uniformity of spot and labeling and the intensity of labeling were checked with an MA plot (M = log2(Cy5/Cy3), A = log2((Cy5*Cy3)/2)). A quantitative assessment such as measurement of signal-to-noise ratio and the median signal intensity was also performed. Only those arrays having reasonable quality were used for further analysis. The statistically significant differentially expressed genes were selected with SAM using the one-class response with data (log2 Cy5/Cy3) normalized in RBioconductor. Hierarchical clustering was performed with Acuity 4.0 (Axon Instruments). Four independent microarray experiments were performed. Real-time Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was isolated from aldosterone- or vehicle-treated cells using standard procedures and made free of residual genomic DNA contamination using the DNase treatment and removal kit (Qiagen). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed with MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and PCR reactions were set up using the SYBR Green PCR kit (PE Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fluorescence changes during real-time quantitative PCR were measured with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosystems) as previously described (32Esposito L. Gan L. Yu G.Q. Essrich C. Mucke L. J. Neurochem. 2004; 91: 1260-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The following primers were used for PCR: 5′-GGG ACA ACG TCC ACC TTC TG (SGK1), 3′-CGG CTG CTT ATG GAG AAC CT (SGK1), 5′-GTG TGC ACC CTT AAT CCT TAC AGA T (αENaC), 3′-TCC AGC TCT TCC AGA TCC TCT T (αENaC), 5′-TCG ACA AAG CCC TGG TGA A (FKBP5), 3′-AAA ACC ATA GCG TGG TCC AA (FKBP-5), 5′-TGG TGG CCC TAG ACA ACA AGA (GILZ), 3′-TCA CAG CGT ACA TCA GGT GGT T (GILZ), 5′-TTT TTT ATC TGC ACT GCC AAG ACT (cyclophilin), 3′-CAC CTT CCC AAA GAC CAC ATG (cyclophilin). All primers were specifically designed to span intron-exon junctions. The results obtained for different genes are given normalized to the control values relative to cyclophilin. All PCR reactions were performed in triplicate using samples obtained from three independent experiments. A–RT negative control was included with every run. The validity of the method was also independently verified using semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR using a completely different set of primers (data not shown). Xenopus laevis Oocyte Co-expression Assay—The use of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC pSDEasy expression vectors has been described previously (7Chen S.Y. Bhargava A. Mastroberardino L. Meijer O.C. Wang J. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Verrey F. Pearce D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 2514-2519Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Full-length GILZ cDNA was cloned from the mouse cortical collecting duct cell line mpkCCDc14 cells (mGILZ) using RT-PCR into the in vitro expression vector, pMO. An N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was added to facilitate analysis of expression. After preparation of linearized DNA, capped RNAs were synthesized using SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase (mMessage mMachine kit, Ambion). Stage V-VI Xenopus oocytes were microinjected with a mixture of α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunit cRNAs (3 ng each) either alone or in combination with mGILZ cRNA (3 ng). As a control, one group of oocytes was microinjected with an equal volume of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. After injection the oocytes were incubated for 24 h in low Na+ Barth's solution containing 10 mm NaCl, 86 mm N-methyl-d-glutamine·Cl (pH 7.4), 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). For some experiments, 24 h after microinjection the oocytes were treated with 2 μg/ml progesterone (Sigma) (or an equal volume of ethanol as the vehicle control) for 6 h. Some groups were pretreated with 50 μm U0126 (Cell Signaling) (or an equal volume of Me2SO as vehicle control) for 2 h before treatment with progesterone. Electrophysiological measurements were performed at a holding potential of –100 mV in high Na+ Barth's solution containing 96 mm NaCl (other ions as above) using a laboratory-built two-electrode voltage clamp (33Fouladkou F. Koopaei R.A. Vogt B. Flores S.Y. Malbert-Colas L. Lecomte M.C. Loffing J. Frey F.J. Frey B.M. Staub O. Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2004; 287: 550-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Oocytes (six in each group) were continuously superfused in a 200-μl chamber at 6 μl/min. The macroscopic phenamil-sensitive current was defined as the difference between currents obtained in the presence (2 μm) and absence of phenamil. Water-injected oocytes had negligible phenamil-sensitive current (data not shown). After electrophysiological measurements, oocytes were snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C for protein analysis. The figures shown are representative of data obtained from at least three independent batches of oocytes (from at least three separate Xenopus females) with similar results. Transient Transfection of GILZ in mpkCCDc14 Cells—Full-length GILZ cDNA was cloned from mpkCCDc14 cells (mGILZ) using RT-PCR into the in vitro expression vector, pIRES2-EGFP (BD Biosciences). An N-terminal Myc tag (EQKLISEEDL) was added to facilitate analysis of expression. mpkCCDc14 cells (at 70–80% confluency) were transfected with pIRES2-EGFP-Myc-mGILZ or the empty vector alone (4 μgDNA per 2 × 106 cells) using a high efficiency electroporation protocol (nucleofection, Amaxa Biosystems Inc.) according to manufacturer's instructions. In some experiments pMO-Myc-mGilZ was used instead of pIRES2-EGFP-Myc-mGilZ. Both vectors yielded similar results. Preparation of Protein Lysates—After electrophysiological measurements, the mpkCCDc14 cell monolayers were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100) (34Debonneville C. Staub O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2397-2409Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1× phosphatase inhibitors Set-1 and Set-2 (Calbiochem), 1 mm Na3VO4 (Calbiochem), and 2 μm Microcystin-LR (Sigma). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and used for Western blot analysis or immunoprecipitation after protein estimation (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar). Stored Xenopus oocytes were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 137 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4) containing 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture. Lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C to separate out yolk and debris, and the remaining solution was used directly for Western blot analysis. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation of transfected Myc-GILZ was carried out using anti-c-Myc-agarose conjugate (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions with minor modifications. Briefly, cell lysates (1 mg of whole cell lysate) were incubated with 40 μl of the agarose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed 4 times in wash buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl) and collected by brief centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 s. Immunoblotting for Myc-GILZ was performed as described under “Western Blot Analysis.” Western Blot Analysis—Equal quantities of protein (100 μg of mpkC-CDc14 cell lysate or 2 oocyte-lysate equivalents per lane) or immunoprecipitated samples were electrophoresed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (36Rama S. Petrusz P. Rao A.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2004; 218: 79-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Biosciences). The blots were first probed for phospho-ERK (E10 monoclonal phospho-ERK1/2 antibody; Cell Signaling, 1:1000 dilution). Each phospho-ERK blot was subsequently stripped and re-probed for total-ERK to ensure equality of protein loading. The total-ERK 1/2 antibody (goat polyclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used at a dilution of 1:100. In some experiments the blot was stripped yet again and re-probed with anti-Myc antibody (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Cell Signaling, 1:500 dilution) to assess heterologously expressed Myc-tagged GILZ expression. For densitometric analysis, signal intensities of various bands were determined using the NIH Imaging software. The expression levels of specific phospho-ERK bands were inferred upon normalizing their signal intensities to that of total-ERK within the same lane (for quantification of mpkCCDc14 ERK blots, signal intensities corresponding to both ERK1 and ERK2 were added to provide one value). Values so obtained were used to determine mean ± S.E. for a graphical representation. Significance was determined using standard statistical tests as described below.

Several studies have indicated extensive apoptotic cell death in the infarcted area as well as in the penumbra region of the infarcted tissue. Studies with transgenic animals suggest that the mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis pathway is involved in ischemia-related cell death. This pathway is triggered by activation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members such as Bax. Here, we have identified and synthesized two low molecular weight compounds that block Bax channel activity. The Bax channel inhibitors prevented cytochrome c release from mitochondria, inhibited the decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential, and protected cells against apoptosis. The Bax channel inhibitors did not affect the conformational activation of Bax or its translocation and insertion into the mitochondrial membrane in cells undergoing apoptosis. Furthermore, the compounds protected neurons in an animal model of global brain ischemia. The protective effect in the animal model correlated with decreased cytochrome c release in the infarcted area. This is the first demonstration that Bax channel activity is required in apoptosis.

Apoptosis is a conserved cell death mechanism essential for normal development and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Although apoptosis presumably participates in the development of all cell lineages, aberrations in the expression of pro- or anti-apoptotic proteins have been implicated in the initiation of a variety of human diseases, including arteriosclerosis, heart failure, infertility, autoimmunity, immunodeficiency, and cancer, in addition to diseases affecting the nervous system such as neurodegeneration and ischemia (1Yin X.M.

Several intracellular apoptosis signaling pathways have been identified, including the death receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway (4Schmitz I. Kirchhoff S. Krammer P.H. Int. J. Biochem.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). The induction of apoptosis ultimately converges upon the activation of cysteine proteases of the caspase family. The Bcl-2 family proteins are located upstream at organelle membranes and control the activation of downstream caspases, representing a critical proximal intracellular checkpoint in the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. The Bcl-2 family is composed of pro- and anti-apoptotic members. Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members display sequence homology in four α-helical domains called BH1–BH4. 3The abbreviations used are: BHBcl-2 homologyPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBci1Bax channel inhibitor-1Bci2Bax channel inhibitor-2HEKhuman embryonic kidneyFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterMEFmurine embryonic fibroblast.3The abbreviations used are: BHBcl-2 homologyPBSphosphate-buffered salineMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidVDACvoltage-dependent anion channelCHAPS3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acidBci1Bax channel inhibitor-1Bci2Bax channel inhibitor-2HEKhuman embryonic kidneyFACSfluorescence-activated cell sorterMEFmurine embryonic fibroblast. Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members can be further subdivided into more fully conserved, “multidomain” members with homology in the BH1–BH3 domains (e.g. Bax and Bak) or the “BH3-only” members (e.g. Bid, Bad, and Bim). Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that the multidomain proteins Bax and Bak function as the essential gateway to the intrinsic cell death pathway operating at the mitochondria. The upstream BH3-only members respond to particular apoptotic signals and subsequently, either directly or indirectly, trigger the conformational activation of Bax and/or Bak. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 or deletion of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax increases resistance to ischemic insults, indicating that the mitochondrial pathway is involved in ischemia-related apoptosis (7Martinou J.-C.

Further evidence for the crucial role of Bax in neuronal cell death was provided by a recent study showing that cerebellum granule neurons are protected against prion-induced apoptosis in Bax–/– mice (9Chiesa R.

In normal cells, Bax is present as a soluble monomeric protein in the cytosol. When cells are exposed to various apoptotic stimuli, including hypoxia, the protein translocates specifically to the mitochondria (10Gross A. Jockel J. Wei M.C. Korsmeyer S.J.

A. 2001; 98: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). At the mitochondria, Bax forms oligomers, which are inserted into the outer mitochondrial membrane, permeabilizing the membrane and triggering the release of proteins, including cytochrome c, from the mitochondrial intermembrane space (11Hsu Y.T.

In the cytosol, cytochrome c forms a complex with the cytosolic proteins Apaf-1 and procaspase-9 (15Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6199) Google Scholar). Upon complex formation, caspase-9 is proteolytically modified, leading to its activation. The active caspase-9 activates downstream executor caspases, which subsequently cleave several substrates, ultimately leading to apoptotic cell death.

Recombinant oligomeric Bax possesses channel-forming activity in artificial lipid membranes and triggers cytochrome c release from liposomes and purified mitochondria (16Saito M. Korsmeyer S.J.

Although it is clear that Bax has a central function in the regulation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, it remains unclear how the protein executes its pro-apoptotic activity at the molecular level and whether its channel-forming activity is required. To elucidate the function of Bax, we have identified low molecular weight compounds that function as Bax channel blockers and that do not alter Bax homo-oligomerization. Using this pharmacological tool, we show that Bax channel activity is required for cytochrome c release from mitochondria and that blocking Bax channel activity inhibits mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis in cells in vitro. In addition, the compounds protected neurons against apoptotic cell death in an animal model of global brain ischemia. The effect in vitro is Bax-specific because the channel inhibitors did not prevent apoptosis in Bax-deficient cells, whereas they did in Bak-deficient and wild-type cells. These findings strongly suggest that the mechanism by which these compounds inhibit apoptosis in vivo is through blockage of Bax channel activity and thus, for the first time, demonstrate involvement of Bax channel activity in the regulation of apoptotic cell death. Recombinant Proteins—C-terminally truncated oligomeric Bax was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (19Lewis S. Bethell S.S. Patel S. Martinou J.-C. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1998; 13: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Full-length oligomeric Bax with an N-terminal His tag was expressed in and purified from E. coli (20Montessuit S. Mazzei G. Magnenat E. Antonsson B. Protein Expression Purif. 1999; 15: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bid with an N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose as described (21Kudla G. Montessuit S. Eskes R. Berrier C. Martinou J.-C. Ghazi A. Antonsson B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 22713-22718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). tcBid was generated through cleavage of purified Bid with caspase-8. Liposome Channel Assay—Liposomes containing 20 mm 5,6-carboxyfluorescein in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were prepared as described (18Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C. Science. 1997; 277: 370-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The liposomes were diluted in PBS to give a suitable fluorescence value. The channel activity assay was performed in 96-well plates on a fluorescence plate reader (FLIPR™, Novel Tech Systems Inc.). For the assay, 70 ml of PBS, 15 ml of oligomeric Bax (1 μm) in PBS, and 10 ml of compound in eight dilutions (final concentrations of 22 nm to 3.8 μm) in 10% Me2SO in PBS were mixed in a 96-well plate and incubated at room temperature for 1 min. At the end of the incubation, 20 μl of liposomes in PBS was added, and the fluorescence was monitored in the FLIPR™ every 3 s for 3 min. The fluorescence values at 120 s were used to calculate the IC50 values. Electrophysiological Recordings—Planar lipid membranes were formed from monolayers made from 1% (w/v) lipids in hexane on 70–80-μm diameter orifices in a 15-μm-thick Teflon partition that separated the two chambers as described (22Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1590) Google Scholar, 23Rostovtseva T.K. Bezrukov S.M. Biophys. J. 1998; 74: 2365-2373Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The lipid-forming solutions contained 90% asolectin (soybean phospholipids) and 10% cholesterol or 42% asolectin, 42% diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine, 8% cardiolipin, and 8% cholesterol. Asolectin, diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine, and cardiolipin were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL), and cholesterol was purchased from Sigma. The membranes were made in aqueous solutions containing 250 mm KCl and 1 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 buffered with 5 mm HEPES or MES at pH 7.0 or 5.5, correspondingly. VDAC channels were isolated from rat liver mitochondrial outer membranes and purified according to the standard method (24Parsons D.F. Williams G.R. Chance B. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1966; 137: 643-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 25Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Conductance measurements were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) in the voltage clamp mode. Data were filtered by a low pass 8-pole Butterworth filter (Model 9002, Frequency Devices, Inc., Haverhill, MA) at 15 kHz, recorded on a chart recorder, and directly saved in the computer memory with a sampling frequency of 50 kHz. The inhibitory effect of the compounds was determined as follows. After 20 min of continuous recording of Bax-induced channel activity, the inhibitors (50–60 nm) were added either to the trans-side or to both sides of the membrane under constant stirring for 2 min. The currents were recorded for 10 min, followed by a series of additions of the inhibitor until a significant decrease or complete inhibition of the conductance was obtained. Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release Assay—Mitochondria were isolated from HeLa cells as described (14Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In summary, the cells were suspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and disrupted by passage through a 25 G1 0.5 × 25 needle, and the mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation. The mitochondria were diluted to 0.4 mg/ml in buffer B (10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 125 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm succinate, pH 7.5). The compound was added to 1 ml of mitochondrial suspension, and the samples were incubated for 5 min at room temperature. tcBid was subsequently added to a final concentration of 10 nm, and the samples were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min and centrifuged twice at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was removed and analyzed by Western blotting with an in house-raised rabbit anti-cytochrome c polyclonal antibody. The blots were developed with an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences), and the intensity of the cytochrome c bands was determined by densitometry. Mitochondria incubated without addition of tcBid were taken as the blank value, and 100% cytochrome c release corresponds to mitochondria treated with tcBid in the absence of inhibitor. Quaternary Structure of Purified Bax—Purified recombinant monomeric Bax at a concentration of 0.4 mg/ml was incubated in the presence and absence of the compounds (10 μm) for 1 h at 37°C. Alternatively, Bax was preincubated as described above; at the end of the incubation 2% octyl glucoside was added to induce Bax oligomerization; and the samples were further incubated for 2 h. At the end of the incubation periods, the samples were analyzed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column (PC 3.2/30) equilibrated in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% (w/v) CHAPS, pH 7.5, in the SMART system (Amersham Biosciences). 50 μl of the sample was loaded and eluted at 50 μl/min; 50-μl fractions were collected; and the eluate was monitored at 280 nm. Quaternary Structure of Bax in Cells—HeLa cells were seeded and grown to confluence in 15-cm plates. The cells were then treated with 1 μm staurosporine in the presence and absence of 2 μm Bax channel inhibitor-1 (Bci1) and Bax channel inhibitor-2 (Bci2) for 16 h. In addition, cells were also treated with the compounds in the absence of staurosporine. Untreated cells were used as a negative control. At the end of the incubation, all cells were collected and washed, and the mitochondria were isolated as described above. The mitochondria isolated from the staurosporine-treated cells were washed with 0.1 m Na2CO3, pH 12, to remove non-membrane integrated proteins. Untreated cells and cells treated with the compounds alone were not because this would have removed non-activated Bax completely (14Antonsson B. Montessuit S. Sanchez B. Martinou J.-C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 11615-11623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The washed mitochondria were solubilized in 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 2% (w/v) CHAPS, pH 7.5. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the solubilized mitochondrial proteins was analyzed by gel filtration as described above. The fractions eluted from the column were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Bax antibodies (anti-Bax NT, catalog no. 06-499, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Alternatively, Bax activation was monitored by immunofluorescence in cells treated with staurosporine using anti-Bax NT antibodies (which do not react with non-activated Bax) following the protocol described previously (26Hetz C. Russelakis-Carneiro M. Walchli S. Carboni S. Vial-Knecht E. Maundrell K. Castilla J. Soto C. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 2793-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Induction of Apoptosis in Cell Lines—HeLa cells or SV40 immortalized murine embryonic fibroblasts from wild-type or knockout cells were seeded in 6-well plates; and after 24 h, the cells were treated with 2 μm staurosporine for 3 h with and without a 30-min pretreatment with the inhibitors (10 μm). At the end of the incubation, the mitochondrial membrane potential and cell volume were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) after staining the cells with 3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide (Molecular Probes) as described (27Hetz C. Bono M.R. Barros L.F. Lagos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Analysis was performed using the CellQuest program. In parallel, cells were treated with 2 μm staurosporine for 6 h with and without pretreatment with the inhibitors (2 μm), and nuclear morphology was analyzed by staining with Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes). Alternatively, cell viability was quantified using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium and phenazine methosulfate (CellTiter 96® AQueous, Promega Corp., Madison, WI) according to the recommendations of the supplier. For Bax or Bak overexpression, human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells were transfected using SuperFect reagent (Qiagen Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. After 16 h in the presence or absence of the compounds (2 μm), the cells were collected, and hypodiploid cells were quantified by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis after propidium iodide staining as described previously (27Hetz C. Bono M.R. Barros L.F. Lagos R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2696-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Alternatively, apoptosis was induced by overexpression of tcBid in wild-type, Bax–/–, and Bak–/– murine embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells. tcBid was expressed by retroviral delivery as described previously, and cell viability was determined after 24 h by FACS analysis after propidium iodide staining (28Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3332) Google Scholar). Global Brain Ischemia in Gerbils—Adult male Mongolian gerbils (Elevage Janvier, Le Genest St. Isle, France) weighing 60–80 g were kept in a temperature-controlled (23 ± 1 °C) and light/dark cycle-controlled animal room (lights on at 7 a.m. and off at 7 p.m.). All experiments (eight animals/group) were performed under spontaneous respiration. Anesthesia was induced with 4% isoflurane in a gas mixture of medical air administered via facemask and maintained at 2% isoflurane in the same gas mixture. Bilateral common carotid arteries were dissected and occluded with bulldog clamps for 5 min. To examine the effect of the Bax channel inhibitor on brain ischemia, Bci1 (3 and 30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) and Bci2 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) solubilized in saline were injected 15 min, 24 h, and 48 h after reperfusion. Orotic acid (300 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was used as the reference compound. 7 days after the onset of occlusion, the gerbils were killed by decapitation. The brains were frozen in isopentane (–20 °C) and cut into 20-μm-thick sections in a microtome. The sections were stained with cresyl violet, and infarcts in the right and left parts of the hippocampus were scored with a 4-point scale. Pyramidal cells showing atrophy, shrinkage, nuclear pyknosis, dark cytoplasmic coloration, and vacuolation and the disappearance of the radial striated zone indicated cell degeneration: 0, no loss of CA1 neurons; 1, weak damage of CA1 (CA1/subiculum or CA1/CA3 border); 2, loss of CA1 neurons (less than half); 3, loss of CA1 neurons (more than half); and 4, total loss of CA1 neurons and expansion into other areas (CA3, dentate gyrus, and cortex). The total score is the sum of the scores for the left and right hemispheres (29Gerhardt S.C. Boast C.A. Behav. Neurosci. 1988; 102: 301-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 30Gronborg M.

Global Brain Ischemia-induced Cytochrome c Release in Gerbil Hippocampus—Gerbils were submitted to a 5-min bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries as described above. The ischemic gerbils (n = 2–6) were killed 2, 4, 24, 48, 96, 120, or 168 h after the onset of ischemia. To evaluate the effects of the Bax inhibitor on the global ischemia-induced cytochrome c release in gerbil hippocampus, the animals were treated with Bci1 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 15 min, 24 h, and 48 h after reperfusion. They were killed 5 days after the onset of ischemia. The hippocampi were excised and kept on ice. They were cut into small pieces and subsequently suspended in 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, 210 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), pH 7.4. The cells were disrupted by passage through a 25-gauge 1-inch needle, and the mitochondria were removed by differential centrifugation as described above for isolation of mitochondria from HeLa cells. Three breaking cycles through the needle were performed, and the supernatant fraction from each one was treated and analyzed separately. The supernatant fractions corresponding to the cytosolic cell fraction were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-cytochrome c antibody. Most cytochrome c was detected in the first and second fractions. The Western blots were scanned with a densitometer, and the intensity of the band corresponding to cytochrome c was determined. All cytochrome c values were normalized to the cytochrome c content in the cytosolic fraction from non-ischemic animals, which corresponded to a value of 1. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance, followed by Dunnett's t test. Significance was considered as p < 0.05 versus the control group. Bax Channel Inhibitors in the Liposome Channel Assay—To elucidate the molecular mechanism by which Bax exerts its pro-apoptotic activity, a large collection of low molecular weight compounds was screened for Bax channel inhibitors. The results enabled us to identify and synthesize compounds possessing specific Bax channel inhibitory activity. Here, we describe the mechanism of two of these inhibitors, Bci1 and Bci2 (Fig. 1A). Bax channel-forming activity was first studied using liposomes charged with the fluorescent dye 5,6-carboxyfluorescein. When the liposomes were incubated with either C-terminally truncated or full-length oligomeric Bax, its channel-forming activity induced the release of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein from the liposomes, which was measured as an increase in fluorescence over time. Addition of Bci1 or Bci2 to the assay solution inhibited Bax channel-forming activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B and D). The IC50 values were determined to be 0.81 ± 0.22 and 0.89 ± 0.29 μm, respectively (Fig. 1, C and E). At 2.4 μm, the activity was completely inhibited in both cases. Electrophysiological Characterization of the Bax Inhibitors—Because the liposome assay cannot distinguish between various possible mechanisms of inhibition such as inhibition of Bax insertion into the lipid membrane, the prevention of Bax channel assembly, or a genuine blockage of the Bax channels, we characterized the compounds electrophysiologically. Two typical experiments are illustrated in Fig. 2. Fig. 2A shows an example of Bax channel activity 15 min after addition of 20 nm full-length oligomeric Bax. Addition of 0.15 μm Bci1 caused a gradual decrease in Bax-induced conductance from ∼9 to 0.7 nanosiemens over 10 min (Fig. 2B). The conductance was completely inhibited after addition of 0.20 μm Bci1 (Fig. 2C). The inhibitory effect of Bci2 is illustrated in Fig. 2 (D–F). To avoid any possible interaction between the inhibitor and Bax other than on the Bax-formed channels, the protein and the compound were added to the opposite sides of the membrane. Fig. 2D shows Bax-induced channels 5 min after addition of 30 nm full-length oligomeric Bax to the cis-compartment. Addition of 0.15 μm Bci2 to the trans-compartment caused a gradual decrease in Bax-induced conductance (Fig. 2E), with complete inhibition after addition of 0.2 μm Bci2 (Fig. 2F). The inhibitory effects of both Bci1 and Bci2 were seen in the 0.10–0.22 μm range. We previously demonstrated that full-length oligomeric Bax channels have a wide distribution of conductances, ranging from 100 picosiemens to tens of nanosiemens (18Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.-C.

J. 2002; 368: 915-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). When the Bax-induced conductance was large (more than ∼20 nanosiemens), addition of Bci1 up to 2.6 μm did not inhibit the channels. Bax channel activity is enhanced at acidic pH. The possibility that acidic pH might influence the interaction between Bax channels and the inhibitor was tested by performing experiments at both neutral (pH 7.0, n = 4) and acidic (pH 5.5, n = 9) pH. No difference in inhibition was detected (data not shown). VDAC is one of the major proteins in the mitochondrial outer membrane. It has been suggested that VDAC could play a role in cytochrome c release during apoptosis (32Shimizu S. Narita M. Tsujimoto Y. Nature. 1999; 399: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (1910) Google Scholar). To test the specificity of the inhibitors, we performed control experiments with VDAC channels. No effect on either VDAC channel conductance or gating properties was observed in the presence of 0.20–0.75 μm Bci1 (n = 5) or 0.1–2.0 μm Bci2 (n = 2) (data not shown). Bid is another pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 protein family. We have found that Bid forms stable pores in planar lipid membranes containing cardiolipin after cleavage with caspase-8 (tcBid) (33Rostovtseva T.K. Antonsson B. Suzuki M. Youle R.J. Colombini M.

The Cys loop superfamily of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels plays a prominent role in mediating fast synaptic transmission.

Malfunctions in these receptors are responsible for a number of “channelopathies,” and the receptors are targets of pharmaceutical efforts toward treatments for a wide range of neurological disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, addiction, schizophrenia, and depression (1Leite J.F.

The gating mechanism for the Cys loop superfamily is one of the most challenging questions in molecular neuroscience. At issue is how the binding of a small molecule neurotransmitter can induce a structural change in a large, multisubunit, integral membrane protein sufficient to open (gate) a previously closed ion channel contained within the receptor (3Changeux J.P. Edelstein S.J. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 369-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 4Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). All evidence indicates that the neurotransmitter-binding site is quite remote (50-60 Å) from the channel gate, the region that blocks the channel when the neurotransmitter is absent and that must move to open the channel. The quest for a gating mechanism has been greatly aided by several recent structural advances. First, crystal structures of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP) (5Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Second, continued refinement of cryo-EM images of the Torpedo nAChR by Unwin and co-workers (8Unwin N. Miyazawa A. Li J. Fujiyoshi Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 1165-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar), incorporating insights gained from the AChBP structure, has produced a full atomic scale model (Protein Data Bank code 2BG9) of the nAChR. It is important to appreciate from the outset that 2BG9, although heuristically quite valuable, is not a crystal structure of the nAChR. It is a model built from low resolution data and homology modeling. Nevertheless, it represents a substantial advance for the field, and all modern attempts to obtain molecular scale information on the structure and function of Cys loop receptors must consider this as a starting point. The full 2BG9 model of the nAChR (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar) immediately suggested ways in which the agonist-binding site could couple to the transmembrane region and thus initiate gating. As summarized in Fig. 1, loops 2, 7, and 9 from the AChBP structure are oriented toward the transmembrane region, and indeed, in 2BG9 these loops make contacts with parts of the transmembrane domain. Note that loop 7 is the eponymous Cys loop. The transmembrane region consists of four α-helices per subunit, labeled M1-M4. It is accepted that M2 lines all or most of the channel. Helix M1 extends out of the transmembrane region toward the extracellular domain, creating a segment termed pre-M1. Although M4 is somewhat separated from the rest of the protein in 2BG9, recent modeling studies produce a more compact structure in which M4 is more intimately involved (11Taly A. Delarue M. Grutter T. Nilges M. Novere Le Corringer N. Changeux P.J.J.P. Biophys. J. 2005; 88: 3954-3965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In particular, the C terminus of M4, a region we will term post-M4, can contact the extracellular domain. A key structure is the M2-M3 loop, a short connector between the two transmembrane helices. Topological considerations have long placed this loop at the interface between the transmembrane and extracellular domains. That expectation was resoundingly confirmed by Protein Data Bank code 2BG9, and many workers have anticipated that this loop could play an important role in gating. Indeed, recent work (12Lummis S.C.R.L. Beene D.L. Lee L.W. Lester H.A. Broadhurst R.W. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) has established that a key proline at the apex of the M2-M3 loop provides the conformational switch that gates the channel in the 5-HT3 receptor. Several groups have attempted to identify key interactions in the interface between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain, and we discuss some of these results below. This interface contains a number of charged residues, and most efforts have focused on these, attempting to find crucial electrostatic interactions that regulate gating. Specific hydrophobic interactions have also been proposed (9Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar, 13Kash T.L. Kim T. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 371: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Several interacting pairs have been identified in various receptors (14Kash T.L. Dizon M-J.F. Trudell J.R.

Nature. 2003; 421: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), and specific gating models based on critical electrostatic interactions have been proposed (16Schofield C.M. Jenkins A. Harrison N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34079-34083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Kash T.L. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Biochem. Soc.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 10058-10063Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). We note from the start, however, the curious fact that none of the proposed interactions is conserved across the superfamily. We have been puzzled by the notion that in this closely related family of receptors, the mechanism of action of the essential function of the receptors seems to vary from system to system. In the present work we argue that specific, pairwise electrostatic interactions at the interface between the transmembrane and extracellular domains are not critical to gating. Rather, we argue it is the global charging of this region and the network of interacting ionic residues that are critical to receptor function. We present an overall analysis of charged interfacial residues in the Cys loop superfamily, extensive mutagenesis studies of potential electrostatic interactions in the nAChR, and a reconsideration of previously published data on other receptors to support the model. From such an analysis, a more nearly unified, but less precise, image of the gating mechanism in the Cys loop superfamily emerges. Mutagenesis and mRNA Synthesis—The mRNA that codes for the muscle type nAChR subunits (α, β, γ, and δ) was obtained by linearization of the expression vector (pAMV) with NotI, followed by in vitro transcription using the mMessage mMachine kit purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). The mutations in all subunits were made following the QuickChange mutagenesis protocol (Stratagene). Electrophysiology and Data Analysis—mRNAs of α, β, γ, and δ subunits were mixed in the ratio of 2:1:1:1 and microinjected into stage VI oocytes of Xenopus laevis. Electrophysiology recordings were performed 24-48 h after injection in two-electrode voltage clamp mode using the OpusXpress 6000A (Molecular Devices Axon Instruments). The holding potential was -60 mV and agonist was applied for 15 s (20Cashin A.L. Petersson E.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Acetylcholine chloride and succinylcholine chloride dihydrate were purchased from Sigma. All drugs were diluted to the desired concentrations with calcium-free ND96 buffer. Dose-response data were obtained for at least eight concentrations of agonists and for a minimum of five oocytes. Mutants with Imax equal to or greater than 100 nA were defined as functional. EC50 and Hill coefficients were calculated by fitting the dose-response relation to the Hill equation. All data are reported as mean ± S.E. If saturation was not reached at 1000 μm concentrations of acetylcholine, the EC50 value could not be calculated. For two mutations, αV46A and αV46T, a second mutation was incorporated at the 9′ position of the β subunit (βL251S). This mutation is known to reduce the wild type EC50 to 1.2 μm (21Kearney P.C. Zhang H. Zhong W. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The EC50 of the double mutant was then determined as described. For scatter plots (supplemental Figs. i-iii) the EC50 value of the double mutant was multiplied by 41.7 (50/1.2) to get a corrected EC50 value. The corrected EC50 value was used for the linear regression analysis. EC50 values for succinylcholine were measured in the same manner. Maximal currents elicited by acetylcholine Imax(acetylcholine) and by succinylcholine Imax(succinylcholine) were measured sequentially at saturating concentrations on the same cells. The ratio of Imax(succinylcholine)/Imax(acetylcholine) was calculated for each cell and is reported as mean ± S.E. Unnatural Amino Acid Suppression—The preparation of the unnatural amino acid O-methylthreonine is described elsewhere (21Kearney P.C. Zhang H. Zhong W. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Neuron. 1996; 17: 1221-1229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). O-Methylserine was purchased from Sigma and was protected and activated as described (22Kearney P.C. Nowak N.W. Zhong W. Silverman S. Lester K. Dougherty H.A.D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 1401-1412PubMed Google Scholar). Unnatural amino acids were conjugated to the dinucleotide dCA and ligated to the truncated 74-nucleotide tRNA. The aminoacyl tRNA was deprotected by photolysis immediately prior to co-injection with mRNA containing an amber (TAG) stop codon at the site of interest. Negative and positive controls were employed as reported previously (20Cashin A.L. Petersson E.J. Lester H.A. Dougherty D.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 350-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Bungarotoxin Binding and Western Blotting—48-72 h after injection, oocytes were prewashed with calcium-free ND96 buffer with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, then transferred to the same buffer with the addition of 10 nm 125I-α-bungarotoxin (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and incubated for 1 h at room temperature (23Yoshii K. Lei Y. Mayne K.M. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1987; 90: 553-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Oocytes were then washed four times and counted individually in a gamma counter. Oocytes injected with 50 nl of water were used to determine background. Mutants with more than five times the background reading are regarded to have sufficient expression. In order to detect γ subunit incorporation for several mutants, an HA tag (hemagglutinin epitope) was incorporated at the C terminus in the γ subunit (position γ497). 24-48 h after injection, 10-20 oocytes were incubated in hypotonic solution (5 mm HEPES, 5 mm NaCl) for 10 min, and the vitelline/plasma membranes were then isolated by physical dissection and centrifugation (24Tong Y. Brandt G.S. Li M. Shapovalov G. Slimko E. Karschin A. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The pelleted membranes were resuspended in 5 μl of 2× SDS loading buffer, and SDS-PAGE was performed in 10% Tris-Cl ReadyGels (Bio-Rad). The samples were subjected to Western blot analysis using the anti-hemagglutinin antibody and visualized using an ECL detection kit (Amersham Biosciences). Electrostatics at the Gating Interface—For the purposes of discussion and analysis, we have defined a “gating interface” between the extracellular domain and the transmembrane domain. It is comprised of the following six segments: three from the extracellular domain (all or parts of loops 2, 7, and 9) and three from the transmembrane domain (pre-M1, M2-M3, and post-M4). The precise residues considered are given in TABLE ONE. Unless otherwise noted, we will use the residue numbering system accepted for the nAChR α1 subunit. The selection criterion for the gating interface was geometric; only residues that could reasonably be considered to experience a meaningful electrostatic interaction with another component of the gating interface were included. Because of the low resolution of the nAChR structure and the further uncertainty introduced by extrapolating to other Cys loop receptors, precise distance constraints were not applied. Rather, as illustrated in Fig. 1, we chose a contiguous band of residues in the region where the extracellular and transmembrane domains meet. Some leeway must be given in selecting possible interactions, as residues that are not in direct contact in 2BG9 could become so on transit from the closed state to the open state or going from one receptor to another. We recognize there is some arbitrariness to this assignment, but our studies suggested that extending the definition further out from the interface did not significantly impact the analysis. We will refer to the extracellular component (from loops 2, 7, and 9) and the transmembrane component (from pre-M1, M2-M3, and post-M4) when discussing the gating interface.TABLE ONESelected sequences in the gating interface, highlighting cationic (italic) and anionic (boldface) residuesLoop 2Loop 7L9Pre-M1M2-M3 linkerPost-M4Tor αDEVNQ IIIVTHFPFDQEWMQIRPSTSSAVPLIGKYFAGRLIELSQEGTor βNEKIEEIKVMYFPFDWQWIQRKPETSLSVPIIIRYFLDASHNVPPDNTor γNEKEEAIAVTYFPFDWEWIQRKPETSLNVPLIGKYFLTGHFNQVPEFTor δKETDETINVLYFPFDWEWIRRKPETALAVPLIGKYFVMGNFNHPPAKnACh α1DEVNQIIIVTHFPFDEEWMQRLPSTSSAVPLIGKYFAGRLIELHQQGnACh β1NEKDEEIQVTYFPFDWQWIRRKPETSLAVPIIIKYFLDATYHLPPPEnACh γNEREEAISVTYFPFDWEWIQRKPETSQAVPLISKYFLMAHYNQVPDLnACh δKEVEETISVTYFPFDWEWIRRKPATSMAIPLVGKFFLQGVYNQPPLQnACh α4DEKNQMIDVTFFPFDQEWIRRLPSTSLVIPLIGEYFLPP–WLAGMInACh α7DEKNQVIDVRWFPFDVEWMRRRTATSDSVPLIAQYLMSAPNFVEAVS5HT3ADEKNQVLDIYNFPFDVEWIRRRPATAIGTPLIGVYVMLWSIWQYA–GABA α1SDHDMEMHLEDFPMDAQYLKRKIKVAYATAM-DWFLNREPQLKAPTPGABA α2SDTDMEMHLEDFPMDAQYLKRKIKVAYATAM-DWFLNREPVLGVSP-GABA α3SDTDMEMHLEDFPMDVQYLKRKIKVAYATAM-DWFVNRESAIKGMIRGABA α4SDVEMEMRLVDFPMDGQYLRRKMKVSYLTAM-DWFLSKDTMEKSESLGABA α5SDTEMEMQLEDFPMDAQYLKRKIKVAYATAM-DWFLNREPVIKGAASGABA α6SDVEMEMRLVNFPMDGQYLQRKMKVSYATAM-DWFLSKDTMEVSSSVGABA β1SEVNMDMDLRRYPLDEQFLKRNIKIPY-VKAIDIYVN———-GABA β2SEVNMDMDLRRYPLDEQFLKRNIKIPY-VKAIDMYVN———-GABA β3SEVNMDMDLRRYPLDEQFLKRNIKIPY-VKAIDMYVN———-Gly-α1AETTMDMDLKNFPMDVQFLERQMKVSY-VKAIDIWKIVRREDVHNQ-Gly=α2TETTMDMDLKNFPMDVQFLERQMKVSY-VKAIDIWKIIRHEDVHKK-44 49130 139175207 211266 277426 Open table in a new tab To search for patterns of charged residues, we considered the sequences of 124 subunits from the Cys loop superfamily, 74 cationic and 50 anionic channel subunits (see the Supplemental Material). TABLE ONE shows 22 representative subunits, 11 cationic (excitatory) channels and 11 anionic (inhibitory) channels, and also serves to define the various segments. TABLE TWO summarizes the analysis of the full collection of the 124 subunits. Shown for each segment of the interface are the number of cationic residues (Lys and Arg), the number of anionic residues (Asp and Glu), the net charge (Z), and the number of charged residues (N).TABLE TWOCharge characteristics of the gating interface+−ZNLoop 20.52.3−1.82.8Loop 70.41.9−1.52.4Loop 90.00.5−0.50.5Pre-M12.30.12.22.3M2-M31.00.80.21.8Post-M40.60.7−0.11.3Extracellular0.94.8−3.95.7Transmembrane3.91.62.35.5Gating interface4.86.4−1.611.1 Open table in a new tab Although there is some variation, the typical gating interface contains 47 residues: 18 in the extracellular component and 29 in the transmembrane component. On average, 11.1 or 24% of these residues are charged. This is not significantly different from expectation based on the overall frequencies of occurrence of Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys in proteins (July, 2004, Swiss Protein Database). Most of the residues of the gating interface are or can be easily imagined to be water-exposed to some extent; therefore, this global result is not surprising. Of the ∼11 charged residues found in the gating interface, only two are universally conserved, Asp-138 and Arg-209. So, although all Cys loop receptors have a large number of ionic residues in the gating interface, their locations and absolute charges are variable. Although the two components of the gating interface do not have the same number of amino acids, the total number of charges is essentially the same (5.7 versus 5.5) for the two. There is, however, a dramatic difference in the net charge of the two components. The extracellular component has an overall negative charge, averaging -3.9 over the 124 subunits considered. The transmembrane component has an overall positive charge, averaging +2.3. Thus, there is a global electrostatic attraction in the interface, holding together the extracellular component and the transmembrane component. This interfacial electrostatic interaction is not created by simply putting anions in the extracellular component and cations in the transmembrane component; typically, there are one cationic and five anionic side chains in the extracellular component but four cationic and two anionic side chains in the transmembrane component. We propose that it is the balance among all these charges that controls receptor function. With all these charges packed into a fairly compact space, we felt it more reasonable to consider a network of electrostatic interactions, rather than emphasizing any particular charged pair, as discussed below. There is variability in the charging pattern. Considering only GABAA subunits, α1 shows Z =-6 in the extracellular component and Z =+4 in the transmembrane component. In contrast, the α4 subunit shows Z =-4 in the extracellular component and Z =+2 in the transmembrane component. Despite the smaller Z values, the α4 subunit actually has more ionic residues overall than α1 (n = 16 versus 14). Looking more closely, it is clear that loop 2 carries the most negative charge per residue, followed by loop 7. The largest net positive charge is associated with pre-M1. The total number of charges (N) is slightly larger for the inhibitory channels (average of 11.8 versus 10.7). The “additional charge” is usually cationic, as the net charge is slightly more positive for the inhibitory channels (-1.1 versus -1.9). We propose that Cys loop receptors can function as long as the essential features of the electrostatic network are intact. As shown below, mutations that alter the charge balance are often well tolerated, apparently because they can be absorbed by the larger collection of charges. In fact, full charge reversals (replacing a plus with a minus or vice versa) are often quite acceptable. It appears that the important thing is to have a number of charges in this region, rather than any specific interaction. Studies of the Muscle-type nAChR α Subunit—We have evaluated a number of residues in the gating interface by both conventional mutagenesis and unnatural amino acid mutagenesis (25Nowak M.W. Gallivan J.P. Silverman S.K. Labarca C.G. Dougherty D.A. Lester H.A. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 504-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Many mutations are meant to parallel studies in other receptors, but as noted above, conservation is not strong across the family. We studied the embryonic mouse muscle nAChR with a subunit composition of (α1)2β1γδ. This receptor shows extremely high homology with and is thus directly comparable with the Torpedo receptor modeled by 2BG9. A goal of this work was to conduct an extensive survey of the gating interface, complementing the statistical analysis presented above. As such, we report the results of two-electrode voltage clamp determinations of EC50, rather than the more time-consuming patch clamp studies of single channel behaviors. Because EC50 is a measure of channel function, it reflects contributions from agonist binding and gating. However, the residues studied are not part of the agonist-binding site and so seem unlikely to contribute directly to binding. Furthermore, we show that representative mutations in the gating interface alter the relative efficacy of succinylcholine, a partial agonist of the mouse muscle nAChR (26Placzek A.N. Grassi F. Papke T. Meyer E.M. Papke R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2004; 66: 169-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), supporting a change in the gating of the mutants (14Kash T.L. Dizon M-J.F. Trudell J.R.

Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). In addition, we recently showed that a range of mutations of a key proline at the heart of the gating interface in the M2-M3 loop of the 5HT3A receptor significantly affected EC50 values but did not alter the binding properties of the receptor, establishing a role in gating (12Lummis S.C.R.L. Beene D.L. Lee L.W. Lester H.A. Broadhurst R.W. Dougherty D.A. Nature. 2005; 438: 248-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Extensive mutagenesis studies by Auerbach and co-workers (28Chakrapani S. Bailey T.D. Auerbach A. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) on loops 2 and 7 show that mutations of the sort considered here affect the gating equilibrium. As such, we concluded that the most reasonable interpretation of the changes in EC50 values reported here is that they reflect alterations in channel gating behavior. Our primary focus has been on the α subunits, as these make the largest contribution to the agonist-binding site and are thought to play a prominent role in the gating mechanism (29Corringer P.J.

Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). A “pin-into-socket” arrangement was proposed, ascribing a critical gating role to Val-46. Although it was immediately appreciated by many workers that Val-46 is not conserved in the Cys loop superfamily, the proposal merited investigation. Studies by Harrison and co-workers (13Kash T.L. Kim T. Trudell J.R. Harrison N.L. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 371: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) on analogous residues in the GABAA α1 and β2 subunits and the glycine receptor α1 subunit (the residue is His, Val, and Thr, respectively) provided no support for the pin-into-socket proposal. We have explicitly evaluated Val-46 in the nAChR (TABLE THREE). We wished to determine whether a precise geometrical arrangement of the sort implied by a pin-into-socket interaction was essential for proper receptor function. Not surprisingly, the V46A mutation was substantially deleterious, whereas the more subtle V46I mutant showed near wild type behavior. An advantage of the unnatural amino acid methodology is that i"

Because of their involvement in pathological conditions such as post-ischemic injury and Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, calpains form a class of pharmacologically significant targets for inhibition. We have determined the sequence preference for the hydrolysis of peptide substrates of the ubiquitous μ-calpain isoform by a peptide library-based approach using the proteolytic core of μ-calpain (μI-II). The approach, first described by Turk et al. (Turk, B. E., Huang, L. L., Piro, E. T., and Cantley, L. C. (2001) Nat. Biotechnol. 19, 661–667), involved the digestion of an N-terminally acetylated degenerate peptide library in conjunction with Edman sequencing to determine the specificity for residues found at primed positions. The cleavage consensus for these positions was then used to design a second, partially degenerate library, to determine specificity at unprimed positions. We have improved upon the original methodology by using a degenerate peptide dendrimer for determination of specificity at unprimed positions. By using this modified approach, the complete cleavage specificity profile for μI-II was determined for all positions flanking the cleaved peptide. A previously known preference of calpains for hydrophobic amino acids at unprimed positions was confirmed. In addition, a novel residue specificity for primed positions was revealed to highlight the importance of these sites for substrate recognition. The optimal primed site motif (MER) was shown to be capable of directing cleavage to a specific peptide bond. Accordingly, we designed a fluorescent resonance energy transfer-based substrate with optimal cleavage motifs on the primed and non-primed sides (PLFAER). The μ-calpain core shows a far greater turnover rate for our substrate than for those based on the cleavage site of α-spectrin or the proteolytic sequence consensus compiled from substrate alignments.

Calpains (clan CA, family C2 in the MEROPS data base (1Barrett A.J. Curr. Opin. Drug Discovery Dev. 2004; 7: 334-341PubMed Google Scholar)), a family of calcium-activated intracellular proteases, are found in animals, plants, and possibly bacteria (2Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). They convert intracellular calcium signals (3Carafoli E. Santella L. Branca D. Brini M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2001; 36: 107-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) into a proteolytic signal by catalyzing the limited cleavage of target proteins (4Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar, 5Croall D.E. DeMartino G.N. Physiol. Rev. 1991; 71: 813-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). Among the known cellular substrates of calpain are numerous cytoskeletal proteins, as well as some receptors and integral membrane proteins like the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger, NCX-3 (6Bano D. Young K.W. Guerin C.J. Lefeuvre R. Rothwell N.J. Naldini L. Rizzuto R. Carafoli E. Nicotera P. Cell. 2005; 120: 275-285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Calpains must be strictly regulated because they catalyze irreversible processing in the cell. In one scenario, calpains localize to the plasma membrane under activating conditions (7Gil-Parrado S. Popp O. Knoch T.A. Zahler S. Bestvater F. Felgentrager M. Holloschi A. Fernandez-Montalvan A. Auerswald E.A. Fritz H. Fuentes-Prior P. Machleidt W. Spiess E. J. Biol.

Acta. 1989; 985: 51-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This placement may act to position calpains where they can respond to brief calcium influxes from the opening of calcium channels, resulting in very localized and transient activity. Deactivation of calpain can come about in several ways: binding to the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin (9Wendt A. Thompson V.F. Goll D.E. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 465-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar); autoproteolytic inactivation; or simply the dissipation of local high calcium levels. Unregulated intracellular calcium influx leads to hyperactivation of calpain and is associated with a large numbers of pathologies such as post-ischemic injury (10Kambe A. Yokota M. Saido T.C. Satokata I. Fujikawa H. Tabuchi S. Kamitani H. Watanabe T. Brain Res. 2005; 1040: 36-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Calpains are thus of great biomedical and therapeutic interest, and there is a need for calpain-specific inhibitors that will not affect other cysteine proteases. The active site of any enzyme serves the dual purpose of binding substrates and performing catalysis. For proteases, improvements in the selectivity constant (kcat/Km) for small substrates are mainly driven though improvements in Km. Optimized cleavage sequences are therefore strongly linked to an optimized binding and are valuable for the design of sensitive and specific peptidomimetic substrates, as well for the design of lead compounds in drug and inhibitor design (12Richardson P.L. Curr Pharm Des. 2002; 8: 2559-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 13Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Fukui I. Murachi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Because of the broad substrate specificity of calpains, the determination of their optimal cleavage sequence has been elusive. This is reflected in the paucity of sensitive substrates and highly specific, active site-directed inhibitors. The wide range of residues that flank known calpain cleavage sites suggests that the conventional calpains can accommodate a variety of side chains within their active site binding pocket (14Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol.

Early kinetic studies of synthetic peptidyl compounds possessing a variety of unprimed side 4Standard nomenclature of peptidyl substrates of proteases defines residue positions C-terminal to the cleaved bond as P′ (or primed) positions and those N-terminal to the cleaved bond as P (or unprimed) positions. Also, these positions are numerically and sequentially identified from their distance to the cleaved bond, such that P2′ is the second residue position C-terminal to the cleaved bond. Similarly, the subsite on the protease where residue P2′ interacts is known as the S2′ subsite. residues revealed some preferences at the P1 and P2 positions (13Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Fukui I. Murachi T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 16Sasaki T. Kikuchi T. Yumoto N. Yoshimura N. Murachi T. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12489-12494Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high cost and effort of synthesis limited the early studies to certain residues that reflected observed cleavages in natural peptides, and this created a bias in the observed specificity. Other attempts to deduce a sequence motif from observed cleavage sites in proteins and naturally occurring peptides revealed no consistent sequence preference, other than that observed from synthetic substrates (17Banik N.L. Chou C.H. Deibler G.E. Krutzch H.C. Hogan E.L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 37: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 19Hirao T. Hara K. Takahashi K. J. Biochem.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1986; 367: 1147-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This suggests that higher order structural features, such as peptide bond accessibility, backbone conformation, or three-dimensional structure, are key factors in cleavage site determination. A recent compilation of 106 known calpain cleavage sites in protein substrates has revealed propensities for certain residues at positions P4 to P7′ (14Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20775-20785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). However, because such proteome studies ignore the kinetics of cleavage, the ability to extrapolate these results to small peptidyl or peptidomimetic substrates and inhibitors is limited. Moreover, because the data were compiled from protein substrates, the primary sequences of the cleavage sites may have a minimal role in directing the cleavage, which would be expected if higher order structural factors were involved in the recognition. It is also plausible that substrates of calpain may have evolved to possess a suboptimal primary sequence, surrounding the presumably exposed scissile peptide bond, to control its susceptibility to the protease. In this case optimal sequence data would not be observed from a natural substrate. Results from a number of other recent studies suggest that, contrary to the dogma of papain-like cysteine proteases, calpains possess significant structural determinants at primed positions (14Tompa P. Buzder-Lantos P. Tantos A. Farkas A. Szilagyi A. Banoczi Z. Hudecz F. Friedrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20775-20785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 23Mittoo S. Sundstrom L.E. Bradley M. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 319: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Substrates designed to include primed side interactions are kinetically superior to other commercially available substrates that use only unprimed positions. A systematic kinetic analysis of residue preference remains to be done for primed positions. Library-based approaches for the determination of substrate specificity allow for fast and exhaustive surveys of a large number of residue-subsite combinations (24Turk B.E. Cantley L.C. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2003; 7: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Also, mixture-based libraries are relatively inexpensive to generate. Short peptides of random sequence are unlikely to possess extensive secondary structure, confining cleavage determinants to the primary structure, and control of the digestion time allows for selection of kinetically favored cleavages. Recently, a methodology was published to allow for the quick, systematic determination of the cleavage specificity of proteases using a limited number of mixture-based peptide libraries. This method, first described by Turk et al. (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), involves a minimum of two rounds of digestion of different peptide library mixtures, followed by N-terminal sequencing to determine the relative abundance of each residue (see Fig. 1). Each sequencing cycle corresponds to a specific position in the substrate. The first round reveals primed side residue specificity (see Fig. 1A), and this is applied in the design of a second, partially degenerate library, used to reveal unprimed side residue specificities (see Fig. 1B) (25Turk B.E. Huang L.L. Piro E.T. Cantley L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar, 26Turk B.E. Cantley L.C. Methods. 2004; 32: 398-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We have applied and improved upon this methodology (see Fig. 1C) to determine the complete cleavage specificity profile as well as the optimal cleavage sequence for the protease core of μ-calpain. Members of the calpain family share a calcium-dependent papain-like protease core that can be divided into two domains (I and II) or subdomains (IIa and IIb) (27Hosfield C.M. Elce J.S. Davies P.L. Jia Z. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6880-6889Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 28Strobl S. Fernandez-Catalan C. Braun M. Huber R. Masumoto H. Nakagawa K. Irie A. Sorimachi H. Bourenkow G. Bartunik H. Suzuki K. Bode W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 588-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Each protease core domain possesses a calcium-binding site that upon occupation cooperatively drives the catalytic triad into an active configuration (29Moldoveanu T. Jia Z. Davies P.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6106-6114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of the proteolytic core of the μ-calpain isoform (μI-II), as an isolated construct, results in a soluble calpain, which when compared with the full-length calpain has a similar specificity for cleavage of protein substrates and a similar response to active site-directed inhibitors (30Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M. Lim D. Elce J.S. Jia Z. Davies P.L. Cell. 2002; 108: 649-660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Although this mini-calpain has a much lower catalytic efficiency, unlike the native enzyme, it resists autolysis. Also, it maintains its solubility in the presence of calcium and so presents a useful model for determining the specificity of μ-calpain. The results obtained in this study reveal that μI-II possesses a general preference for hydrophobic amino acids at unprimed positions, which is consistent with previous literature. Also, a novel residue specificity for primed positions is revealed, one that is not apparent from studies of protein substrate cleavage sites. Specifically it shows a preference for methionine or alanine at P1′, glutamic acid at P2′, and basic amino acids at P3′. The optimal (MER) sequence derived from primed side specificity was validated by its ability to successfully direct cleavage to a specific bond within a partially degenerate peptide. The incorporation of the optimal cleavage sequence (PLFAER) in an internally quenched fluorescent substrate resulted in a significantly faster turnover of the substrate compared with analogous compounds incorporating other known calpain cleavage sequences. Materials—Peptide libraries (see TABLE ONE) were obtained from the Tufts University Core Facility (Boston, MA). Typical yields were 100–200 mg of crude peptide.

All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The recombinant protease core of μ-calpain, μI-II, was purified from Escherichia coli as previously described (30Moldoveanu T. Hosfield C.M.

Proteolytic Digestion of Libraries—The crude peptide libraries (see TABLE ONE) were dissolved in Me2SO prior to a 20-fold dilution to stock concentrations of 5–10 mg/ml with 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.6). Digestion of the degenerate library by the protease Asp-N was performed at 37 °C in 20 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.6), using 0.4 mg/ml peptide library and 1.3 μg/ml of Asp-N. All digestions by μI-II were carried out at 37 °C in 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.6), 1 mm EDTA, 6 mm CaCl2, 50–100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, using 50 μg/ml final concentration of the protease μI-II. The digestion was initiated by the addition of 0.4 mg/ml of the N-acetylated library or 1.0 mg/ml of the MAP-conjugated library. Control digests had either the peptide library or the calcium omitted. Digestion was stopped after a specific time period by adding 0.5 m EDTA (pH 8.0) to 11 mm final concentration. Digested samples were stored frozen when necessary. Monitoring the Extent of Digestion with Fluorescamine—An aliquot (10 μl) of 0.2% (w/v) fluorescamine in acetone was added to 100 μl of digest and allowed to react for at least 5 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was read in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS-50-B fluorimeter using an excitation wavelength of 388 nm and an emission wavelength of 475 nm. Determination of the Cleavage Profile at Primed Positions—The degenerate N-acetylated 12-mer library (see TABLE ONE) was digested by μI-II as described above. After 0.5 h of digestion (corresponding to ∼15% completeness, where 100% digestion refers to the fluorescence value at the asymptote for the digestion curve for μI-II (see Fig. 2)), a 400-μl aliquot was stopped by the addition of EDTA and lyophilized prior to N-terminal sequencing. Determination of the Cleavage Profile at Unprimed Positions—A partially degenerate library conjugated to a MAP scaffold (see TABLE ONE) was partially digested by μI-II as described above. A 0.5-h digest (0.5 ml) was quenched with EDTA and applied onto a 30-cm × 0.6-cm column containing Sephadex G-25(M) gel permeation resin previously equilibrated in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. Fractions (0.4 ml) were collected and analyzed for peptide content using fluorescamine as described above. This gel permeation step was repeated a total of eight times to recover enough N-terminal fragments for Edman degradation. The fractions containing the N-terminal fragments (fractions 12–15 inclusive) from all eight runs were then pooled, concentrated by lyophilization, and reapplied onto the column to remove any contaminating scaffold. The pool of N-terminal fragments was then lyophilized to dryness, with three cycles of resuspension in water to remove traces of residual ammonium bicarbonate that could interfere with the peptide sequencing. Peptide Analysis—Edman degradation of samples was performed either at the Alberta Peptide Institute (Edmonton, Canada) or the Advanced Protein Technology Center (Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Canada). The HPLC profiles resulting from phenylthiohydantoin-derivative analysis were calibrated using 10 pmol of each phenylthiohydantoin-derivative standard. For the N-acetylated library, the background resulting from a small percentage (∼5%) of unacetylated peptides was obtained by sequencing an undigested aliquot and subtracting the values obtained from the sequencing results of the digest. No background subtraction was necessary for the MAP-conjugated library. The selectivity of a residue at any one position is defined as the ratio of the abundance of the residue observed at the position to the abundance of the residue expected in the absence of any specificity. The latter was determined by amino acid analysis (Advanced Protein Technology Center) for the N-acetylated library or from the N-terminal sequencing of an aliquot of undigested library for the MAP-conjugated library. The values were not calculated for tryptophan because of its instability during amino acid analysis and sequencing conditions. Digestion analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed at the Protein Function Discovery Facility (Queen's University, Kingston, Canada) on a [email protected] (Micromass) instrument. For sample preparation, a 1.0-μl volume of freshly prepared and recrystallized α-cyano-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix was overlaid with 1.0 μl of a digestion sample. The spectra shown are a sum of 100 shots, with peak signals of 3–95% intensity collected. Kinetic Analysis of FRET-based Substrates—The crude FRET-based peptides were purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a C18 column. The purified product was lyophilized and dissolved in Me2SO ((EDANS)-EPLKSPPK-(DABCYL), (EDANS)-EPLFAERK-(DABCYL), SLY-MCA), or dimethyl formamide ((EDANS)-EEVYGMMK-(DABCYL)) and stored at -20 °C. The concentrations of these substrate stocks were normalized by diluting the substrates in 8 m guanidine HCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) and using the observed 477 nm absorbance peak of DABCYL as an indication of their relative concentration. Kinetic assays were done in 50 mm MOPS-NaOH (pH 7.7), 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl at 35 °C. The reaction was initiated by the addition of a calcium chloride solution to a final free calcium concentration of 5 mm using enzyme concentrations of either 2.5 μm (for (EDANS)-EPLKSPPK-(DABCYL), (EDANS)-EEVYGMMK-(DABCYL), and SLY-MCA) or 250 nm (for (EDANS)-EPLFAERK-(DABCYL)) μI-II. The reactions were monitored in a 50-μl micro-cuvette (Hellma, Plainview, NY) to minimize sample volume and the inner filter effect. Excitation/emission wavelengths of 335/500 nm for the FRET-based substrates and 360/460 nm for SLY-MCA were used. No increase in fluorescence was observed in the absence of calcium. Correction factors to compensate for the inner filter effect were determined empirically for each individual reaction from the equation shown below, where Co and Io are the substrate concentration and initial fluorescence (prior to hydrolysis) of the experimental sample, respectively, and Crf and Irf are the substrate concentration and initial fluorescence of the reference sample, respectively. IEFCorrectionfactor=(Co×Irf)/(Crf×Io)(Eq. 1) The reference contained a low concentration of substrate that had been verified to show an insignificant inner filter effect (IFE) (usually 10 μm). The Io value was determined by extrapolation of the linear portion of the reaction curve back to the time of initiation of the reaction. Under these conditions, a typical correction factor for 50 μm of a FRET-based substrate was ∼1.4. The fluorescence coefficients to convert changes in fluorescence to changes in concentrations of cleaved substrate were determined by allowing the hydrolysis of a known amount of substrate to go to completion using a vast excess of μI-II. The turnover rate was obtained by dividing the molar rate of substrate hydrolysis (m/s) observed at each substrate concentration by the enzyme concentration used. Specificity Profile at Primed Positions—To obtain the specificity profile at primed positions, an N-acetylated, completely degenerate peptide library (TABLE ONE) was digested and subjected to N-terminal Edman degradation to reveal the proportion of residues found at each primed position (Fig. 1A). This method was validated and calibrated using a protease with a strict specificity at primed positions. Digestion of the library with the endoprotease Asp-N yielded almost exclusively Asp residues in the first cycle of sequencing (results not shown), agreeing with the known specificity of the protease (31Drapeau G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 839-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Digestion of the library was monitored by observing the production of N termini using fluorescamine, which reacts with primary amino groups (including those of the ϵ-amino group from lysine side chains) to form a fluorescent product (32Udenfriend S. Stein S. Bohlen P. Dairman W. Leimgruber W. Weigele M. Science. 1972; 178: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (2202) Google Scholar). The calcium dependence of this digestion, demonstrated by the production of new N termini in the presence of CaCl2 but not in its absence, establishes that cleavage results from the action of μI-II and not a co-purifying E. coli protease (Fig. 2). Because Asp residues should occur at a frequency of approximately one residue for every two degenerate peptides, the comparison of the fluorescence signal arising from the complete digestion of the peptide library by Asp-N with the signal from digestion by μI-II allows an estimate of ≥0.5 cuts/peptide catalyzed by μI-II within the first 12 h. To select for kinetically favored cleavages, an early time point from the digestion (0.5 h, equivalent to 15–20% completeness) was subjected to N-terminal sequencing (Fig. 3A). The sequencing results show a strong selection for Ala (selectivity, 2.8) and Met (4.1) in the first sequencing cycle, indicating a preference for these residues at position P1′ of a peptide substrate. The second cycle, representing position P2′, shows a preference for the residues Glu (selectivity, 2.1), Met (selectivity, 2.3), and Ala (selectivity, 2.0). Incomplete cleavage in the first cycle may partially explain the apparent selection for Ala and Met in the second cycle, whereas Glu shows a distinct 3-fold increase in selectivity from the first to the second cycle. This indicates a genuine preference for Glu at position P2′. The third sequencing cycle features a selectivity for Arg (selectivity, 2.9), with Lys (selectivity, 2.1) also ranking high, suggesting that the residue at P3′ may interact with the protease-binding subsite through ionic interactions with acidic residues. The fourth and fifth cycles show no distinct preference for a residue (specificity ratio < 1.8 for all residues), apart from a general overabundance of residues bearing hydrophilic side chains relative to those bearing hydrophobic ones (data not shown), indicating no specificity for positions more distal than P3′.

Mapping by yeast two-hybrid analysis and co-immunoprecipitation showed that phospho-WOX1 physically interacted with Ser46-phosphorylated p53. Knockdown of WOX1 protein expression by small interfering RNA resulted in L929 fibroblast resistance to apoptosis by tumor necrosis factor, staurosporine, UV light, and ectopic p53, indicating an essential role of WOX1 in stress stimuli-induced apoptosis. Notably, UV light could not induce p53 protein expression in these WOX1 knockdown cells, although p53 mRNA levels were not reduced. Suppression of WOX1 by dominant negative WOX1 (to block Tyr33 phosphorylation) also abolished UV light-induced p53 protein expression. Time course analysis showed that the stability of ectopic wild type p53, tagged with DsRed, was decreased in WOX1 knockdown cells. Inhibition of MDM2 by nutlin-3 increased the binding of p53 and WOX1 and stability of p53.

Also, absent expression of these family proteins in metastatic cancer cells is not necessarily due to disruption of the WWOX gene.

Briefly, binding of a cytosolic Sos-tagged bait protein to a cell membrane-anchored target protein (tagged with a myristoylation signal) results in activation of the Ras signaling pathway in yeast. This activation allows mutant yeast cdc25H to grow in 37 °C using a selective agarose plate containing galactose. Without binding, yeast cells fail to grow at 37 °C.

Recent evidence suggests that hypothalamic malonyl-CoA functions in the regulation of feeding behavior by altering the expression of key orexigenic and anorexigenic neuropeptides. Here we report that 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR), a 5′-AMP kinase activator, rapidly lowers malonyl-CoA both in GT1-7 hypothalamic neurons and in the hypothalami of mice. These effects correlate closely with the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, an established target of AMP kinase. Intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of AICAR rapidly lowers hypothalamic [malonyl-CoA] and increases food intake. Expression of an adenoviral cytosolic malonyl-CoA decarboxylase vector (Ad-cMCD) in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells decreases malonyl-CoA. When delivered by bilateral stereotaxic injection into the ventral hypothalamus (encompassing the arcuate nucleus) of mice, Ad-cMCD increases food intake and body weight. Ad-MCD delivered into the ventral hypothalamus also reverses the rapid suppression of food intake caused by i.c.v.-administered C75, a fatty acid synthase inhibitor that increases hypothalamic [malonyl-CoA].

Taken together these findings implicate malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior. A unique hypothalamic mechanism appears to link fatty acid synthesis to the expression of the key neuropeptides that regulate feeding behavior. The steady-state level of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid synthetic pathway, is thought to have a regulatory role in this system (1Dowell P. Hu Z. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar).

Administration of C75, a potent inhibitor of FAS (2Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 2004; 317: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). With obese mice this weight loss is due primarily to a reduction of body fat (5Kumar M.V. Shimokawa T. Nagy T.R. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1921-1925Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). These effects are independent of leptin, since C75 causes weight loss in both leptin-deficient (ob/ob) or leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice (3Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L.

Thus, C75 blocks the fasting-induced up-regulation of orexigenic (AgRP and NPY) and down-regulation of anorexigenic (CART and POMC) neuropeptides in the hypothalamus (3Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E.

Consistent with this hypothesis the administration of C75 leads to an increase of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA (7Hu Z. Cha S.H. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).Recent studies suggest that the changes in hypothalamic malonyl-CoA may depend upon the activity of hypothalamic AMP kinase (8Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol.

It has long been recognized that AMP kinase in peripheral tissues (e.g. liver, adipose, and muscle) acts as a “sensor” of cellular energy charge (10Yeh L.A. Lee K.H. Kim K.H. J. Biol.

Only recently, however, has evidence been obtained for the involvement of AMP kinase sensing in the hypothalamus (8Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H.

Biochem. 2005; 74: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Conditions under which AMP kinase would be expected to be active and ACC inactive, e.g. in the fasted state, hypothalamic malonyl-CoA is extremely low (7Hu Z. Cha S.H. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Consistent with this finding, the anorexigenic hormone leptin lowers AMP kinase activity in the hypothalamus (13Minokoshi Y. Alquier T. Furukawa N. Kim Y.B. Lee A. Xue B. Mu J. Foufelle F. Ferre P. Birnbaum M.J. Stuck B.J. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2004; 428: 569-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (1317) Google Scholar). Likewise, the anorexigenic FAS inhibitor, C75, appears to reduce hypothalamic AMP kinase activity (8Kim E.K. Miller I. Aja S. Landree L.E. Pinn M. McFadden J. Kuhajda F.P. Moran T.H. Ronnett G.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19970-19976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that lowering hypothalamic AMP kinase activity is required to elicit the anorexigenic effects of leptin or C75. Lowering hypothalamic AMP kinase activity might be expected to activate ACC and elevate hypothalamic malonyl-CoA. While a direct linkage of the AMP kinase signaling system to changes in malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamus is suspected, it has not been demonstrated.Moreover, the role of malonyl-CoA as a regulator of feeding behavior in studies with C75 remains controversial because the specificity of the FAS inhibitor has been questioned (14Lawrence D.S.

In the present paper, we describe two independent approaches that provide compelling evidence for the direct involvement of malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamic regulation of feeding behavior. It was found that overexpression of cytosolic MCD (cMCD) or treatment with a 5′-AMP kinase agonist, AICAR, decreases malonyl-CoA in hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons. We also show that intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of AICAR to mice activates the phosphorylation of ACC, lowers hypothalamic [malonyl-CoA], and increases food intake. Likewise, bilateral stereotaxic injection of adenoviral cMCD into the ventral hypothalamus increases food intake.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—Male BALB/c mice (20–25 g) from Charles River Laboratories were acclimated for 1 week to a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle at 22 °C before experimentation.

The injection was directed to stereotaxic coordinates 1.5 mm posterior to the bregma, ±0.5 mm lateral to midline, and 5.8 mm below the surface of the skull. Adenovirus vectors, either Ad-LacZ (6.3 × 1012 pfu/ml) or Ad-cMCD (7.8 × 1012 pfu/ml), were delivered with a syringe injector pump (World Precision Instruments Inc., Sarasota, FL) at a rate of 100 nl/min for 2.5 min (250 nl/injection site), and the entire injector system was left in place for an additional 10 min after the injections were completed. After the procedure was complete, mice were placed in a heated cage until they recovered from anesthesia after which they were returned to their cages. Food intake and body weight were measured daily for 2 weeks starting from day 3 following surgery.i.c.v. Injection of AICAR and C75—BALB/c mice were either fed ad libitum or were fasted for 23 h, then anesthetized with isoflurane before i.c.v. injection of AICAR (6 μg) or C75 (10 μg) in 2 μl of RPMI 1640 medium, respectively. i.c.v. injections were delivered into the lateral ventricle with a calibrated 10-μl Hamilton syringe 1 h before the start of the dark cycle. After C75 administration, where indicated, mice were refed 30 min later. Two and a half hours after i.c.v. injection, cumulative food intake was measured and hypothalami were removed. Mice receiving C75 i.c.v. exhibited drastically reduced (>90%) food intake.Immunohistochemical Analyses—On day 17 after adenovirus injection, mice were placed under deep ketamine/xylazine anesthesia and perfused with 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.4) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Perfused brains were removed, placed in the same fixative for an additional 4 h at room temperature, and then cryoprotected in 30% sucrose, 0.1 m PBS overnight. Brains were snap-frozen on dry ice and stored at –80 °C for further analysis. Coronal brain sections (16 mm) were washed in PBS and incubated in X-gal staining solution (1 mg/ml X-gal, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5mm K4Fe(CN)6) overnight to visualize β-galactosidase activity.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONEffects of an AMP Kinase Activator and an Adenoviral cMCD Vector on Hypothalamic GT1-7 Neurons—The phosphorylation of ACC1 and ACC2 by 5′-AMP kinase is known to decrease its catalytic activity (10Yeh L.A. Lee K.H. Kim K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hardie D.G. Carling D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1126) Google Scholar). Preliminary to testing the effect of AICAR, a precursor of a potent AMP kinase activator, on hypothalamic malonyl-CoA and feeding behavior in vivo, AICAR was first tested on hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons in cell culture. As illustrated in Fig. 1A treatment of GT1-7 cells with AICAR rapidly activated the phosphorylation of ACC without altering expression of the enzyme. Closely correlated with phosphorylation, the cellular level of its carboxylation product, malonyl-CoA, decreased by ≥70% (Fig. 1B).To assess the effect of overexpressing cytosolic cMCD on malonyl-CoA, hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons were transduced with an adenoviral cMCD expression vector (Ad-cMCD). Ad-cMCD harbors the mouse cDNA encoding a cMCD in which both the peroxisome and mitochondrial targeting signals have been deleted to promote expression in the cytoplasm (19Roduit R. Nolan C. Alarcon C. Moore P. Barbeau A. Delghingaro-Augusto V. Przybykowski E. Morin J. Masse F. Massie B. Ruderman N. Rhodes C. Poitout V. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2004; 53: 1007-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). As verified by immunoblotting the expression vector markedly increased the cellular level of cMCD relative to that of endogenous MCD (Fig. 1C and inset). Moreover, overexpression of cMCD leads to a marked decrease in malonyl-CoA. This observation, and that described above (Fig. 1, A and B), validate two approaches by which malonyl-CoA can be lowered in hypothalamic neurons ex vivo, either by preventing its formation or by accelerating its removal.Effect of i.c.v. Administration of the AMP Kinase Activator, AICAR—To investigate the effect of activating AMP kinase in vivo, AICAR was administered to mice by i.c.v. injection. Following injection, food intake was measured during the next 2 h at which time hypothalamic extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting for ACC and phospho-ACC and analysis for malonyl-CoA content. As shown in Fig. 2A the phosphorylation of ACC was rapidly and significantly increased without affecting the level of ACC protein. This increase in phospho-ACC was accompanied by a decrease in [malonyl-CoA] and an increase of food intake (Fig. 2, B and C, respectively).FIGURE 2Effect of i.c.v. administration of AICAR on ACC phosphorylation and malonyl-CoA in the hypothalamus. AICAR (6 μg) was administered to BALB/c mice by i.c.v. injection. After 2 h hypothalamic tissue was quickly (≤60 s) removed and subjected to: immunoblotting with anti-phospho(Ser79)-ACC2 or ACC antibodies (A) and quantification of malonyl-CoA content (B). C, food intake was measured for 2 h after i.c.v. administration of AICAR. * and **, p < 0.05 or p < 0.01, respectively, versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Effect of Stereotaxic Delivery of Ad-cMCD into the Ventral Hypothalamus—To determine the effect of overexpressing cMCD in the ventral hypothalamus on food intake and weight gain, an Ad-cMCD expression vector was delivered directly into the ventral hypothalamus of mice by bilateral stereotaxic injection. To verify the delivery of the viral construct to the ventral hypothalamus, a control adenoviral β-galactosidase vector (Ad-LacZ) was tested using the same stereotaxic injection procedure. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, 3 days after bilateral stereotaxic injection β-galactosidase expression was detected in the ventral hypothalamus adjacent to and below the third ventricle. Expression was particularly pronounced in the region encompassing the arcurate nucleus, a region that contains sets of neurons known to function in the regulation of feeding behavior (20Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). This staining pattern is typical of many other stereotaxic injection experiments, thus verifying the appropriate placement of the adenoviral expression vectors in the ventral hypothalamus.FIGURE 3Effect of stereotaxic injection of Ad-cMCD into the ventral hypothalamus on food intake and body weight of mice given i.c.v. C75. Ad-cMCD or Ad-LacZ expression vectors were administered by bilateral stereotaxic injection into the ventral hypothalamus of BALB/c mice. A, after 3 days the brain was sectioned and stained for β-galactosidase expression. Shown is the typical β-galactosidase staining pattern obtained in the ventral hypothalamus with prominent staining in the region of the arcuate nucleus. 3V refers to third ventricle. B and C, food intake (B) and body weight (C) were measured during the next 12 days. D, two groups of mice were given stereotaxic injections of the Ad-cMCD or Ad-LacZ expression vectors. Fourteen days later half of the mice in each group were given i.c.v. injections of 10 μg of the FAS inhibitor C75 after which food intake was measured during the next 2 h. MCD and LacZ refer to mice that received stereotaxic injections (ventral hypothalamus) of the Ad-cMCD or Ad-LacZ expression vectors, respectively; in B and C, there were 10 mice in the LacZ group and 13 mice in the Ad-cMCD group. The differences between groups approached statistical significance at the p = 0.05; in D, 5 mice/group; *, p < 0.001 versus Ad-LacZ, MCD and MCD + C75.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Three days after delivery of the Ad-cMCD vector into the ventral hypothalamus the mice began to exhibit modest, but consistent, increases in food intake and body weight that continued over the next 12 days (Fig. 3, B and C). Since the region into which the cMCD expression vector was delivered comprises only a small fraction of the entire hypothalamus, reliable quantification of the malonyl-CoA concentration within this limited region was not possible. Nevertheless, the same Ad-cMCD vector was shown to lower [malonyl-CoA] ex vivo when transduced into hypothalamic GT1-7 neurons (Fig. 1C).In contrast to the modest effect on food intake of mice chronically exposed to hypothalamic cMCD (Fig. 3, B and C), cMCD dramatically altered food intake in mice given C75 (Fig. 3D). Thus, while i.c.v. C75 almost completely suppressed food intake in control (Ad-LacZ) mice, Ad-cMCD completely reversed the C75-induced blockade of food intake (Fig. 3D). It should be noted that in previous studies (7Hu Z. Cha S.H. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) it was shown that i.c.v. C75 caused a 4-fold increase in hypothalamic malonyl-CoA. Since Ad-cMCD was stereotaxically delivered into the ventral hypothalamus, it is likely that the neurons targeted include those found in the arcuate nucleus, e.g. NPY/AgRP and POMC/CART neurons, which function in the regulation of feeding behavior (20Schwartz M.W. Woods S.C. Porte Jr., D. Seeley R.J. Baskin D.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 661-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar).Why the introduction of Ad-cMCD into the ventral hypothalamus does not produce a greater effect on food intake is unclear. Conceivably, the chronic hypothalamic exposure to cMCD may prompt compensatory changes in the expression of regulatory factors in attempt to normalize food intake. Such compensatory effects occur in gene knock-out models, e.g. NPY and AgRP knock-out mice do not exhibit the expected decreases in food intake (21Palmiter R.D. Erickson J.C. Hollopeter G. Baraban S.C. Schwartz M.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 163-199PubMed Google Scholar, 22Qian S. Chen H. Weingarth D. Trumbauer M.E. Novi D.E. Guan X. Yu H. Shen Z. Feng Y. Frazier E. Chen A.

However, when placed in the context of leptin deficiency, as in NPY–/–-ob/ob mice, the expected phenotype of NPY deficiency occurs (23Erickson J.C. Clegg K.E. Palmiter R.D. Nature. 1996; 381: 415-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar).Taken together with previous findings (7Hu Z. Cha S.H. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 17Cha S.H. Hu Z. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 14557-14562Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), these results provide compelling evidence that malonyl-CoA plays a major role in the hypothalamic control of food intake. Thus, malonyl-CoA appears to be a key cellular indicator of fuel abundance that controls multiple functions related to body weight and fuel including insulin secretion (24Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), insulin action (25Ruderman N. Prentki M. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2004; 3: 340-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), and food intake (1Dowell P. Hu Z. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). A unique hypothalamic mechanism appears to link fatty acid synthesis to the expression of the key neuropeptides that regulate feeding behavior. The steady-state level of malonyl-CoA, an intermediate in fatty acid synthetic pathway, is thought to have a regulatory role in this system (1Dowell P. Hu Z. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 515-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The cellular level of malonyl-CoA is determined by its rate of formation catalyzed by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), 3The abbreviations used are: ACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseFASfatty acid synthaseMCDmalonyl-CoA decarboxylasecMCDcytosolic MCDAd-cMCDadenoviral cMCDi.c.v.intracerebroventricularpfuplaque-forming unitPBSphosphate-buffered salineX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. 3The abbreviations used are: ACCacetyl-CoA carboxylaseFASfatty acid synthaseMCDmalonyl-CoA decarboxylasecMCDcytosolic MCDAd-cMCDadenoviral cMCDi.c.v.intracerebroventricularpfuplaque-forming unitPBSphosphate-buffered salineX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside. relative to its rate of utilization and degradation catalyzed by fatty acid synthase (FAS) and malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD), respectively. Administration of C75, a potent inhibitor of FAS (2Kuhajda F.P. Pizer E.S. Li J.N. Mani N.S. Frehywot G.L. Townsend C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These effects are independent of leptin, since C75 causes weight loss in both leptin-deficient (ob/ob) or leptin receptor-deficient (db/db) mice (3Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E. Frehywot G.L.

C75 appears to exert its anorectic effect by disrupting the signaling system that regulates expression of the hypothalamic neuropeptides that control feeding behavior. Thus, C75 blocks the fasting-induced up-regulation of orexigenic (AgRP and NPY) and down-regulation of anorexigenic (CART and POMC) neuropeptides in the hypothalamus (3Loftus T.M. Jaworsky D.E.

A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) that the accumulation of malonyl-CoA, a substrate of FAS and MCD, may mediate the changes in the expression of these neuropeptides and, therefore, food intake. Consistent with this hypothesis the administration of C75 leads to an increase of hypothalamic malonyl-CoA (7Hu Z. Cha S.H. Chohnan S. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12624-12629Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar).

Through phosphorylation of proteins assembled at the cytoplasmic tails of integrins, FAK promotes signaling events that modulate cellular growth, survival, and migration. The amino-terminal region of FAK contains a region of sequence homology with band 4.1 and ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) proteins termed a FERM domain. FERM domains are found in a variety of signaling and cytoskeletal proteins and are thought to mediate intermolecular interactions with partner proteins and phospholipids at the plasma membrane and intramolecular regulatory interactions. Here we report two crystal structures of an NH2-terminal fragment of avian FAK containing the FERM domain and a portion of the regulatory linker that connects the FERM and kinase domains. The tertiary folds of the three subdomains (F1, F2, and F3) are similar to those of known FERM structures despite low sequence conservation. Differences in the sequence and relative orientation of the F3 subdomain alters the nature of the interdomain interface, and the phosphoinositide binding site found in ERM family FERM domains is not present in FAK. A putative protein interaction site on the F3 lobe is masked by the proximal region of the linker. Additionally, in one structure the adjacent Src SH3 and SH2 binding sites in the linker associate with the surfaces of the F3 and F1 lobes, respectively.

FAK and the related tyrosine kinase Pyk2 (also referred to as CAK-β, RAFTK, or CADTK) comprise a subfamily of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases defined by a central tyrosine kinase domain flanked by an amino-terminal FERM domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain. The latter domain contains a proline-rich region that interacts with other signaling molecules and a distal focal adhesion targeting domain (Fig. 1A).

Association with activated growth factor receptors and the promotion of cell migration in response to growth factor signaling is dependent on an intact FERM domain of FAK (36Sieg D.J. Hauck C.R.

Immunolocalization experiments have suggested that the FERM domain of FAK is sufficient for localization to membrane substructures such as at the leading edge of lamellipodia and cell-cell junctions, and although not directly responsible for focal adhesion targeting, can modulate the localization of the protein (37Dunty J.M.

Interestingly, sequences in the F2 subdomain of the FAK FERM domain play a role in activation of FAK signaling following cell adhesion (40Dunty J.M. Gabarra-Niecko V. King M.L. Ceccarelli D.F. Eck M.J. Schaller M.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 5353-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The physical nature of these interactions remains to be elucidated. To better understand the function of the FERM domain of FAK, and as a starting point for dissecting its inter- and intramolecular interactions, we have determined its structure in two crystal forms at resolutions of 2.5 Å and 2.35 Å. The tri-lobed architecture of ERM family FERM domains is preserved in FAK (22Hamada K. Shimizu T. Masui T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T.

The structures show that the phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2 binding site found in ERM family FERM domains is not preserved in FAK. Additionally, the structures reveal that the FERM-kinase linker segment masks a potential protein interaction site on the F3 lobe; the corresponding site in the talin and radixin FERM domains has been shown to bind the cytoplasmic tails of β integrins and ICAM-2, respectively (21Hamada K. Shimizu T. Yonemura S. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 48Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S.

We hypothesize that this masking interaction could be released by binding of Src family proteins to their adjacent docking sites in the linker. Materials—Restriction and modifying enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs. Oligonucleotides were from Sigma; B834 Escherichia coli cells were from Novagen. Seleno-l-methionine was from Sigma; metal chelating, ion exchange, and gel filtration columns were from Amersham Biosciences. Protein Expression and Purification—The FERM domain of avian FAK was amplified by PCR from cDNA (Swiss-Prot accession number Q00944). DNA fragments encoding amino acids 1–405, 31–405, and 31–399 were each ligated into a modified pET vector containing an amino-terminal His6 tag with a tobacco etch virus cleavage site and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The expression of recombinant protein in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells was induced at an optical density (A600) of 0.8 by the addition of 0.2 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for an additional 12–16 h at 18 °C. The cells were harvested and the pellets were stored frozen at –70 °C. Cell pellets were thawed in buffer A (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) with the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm benzamadine, 10 mg/ml lysozyme, and 1 mg/ml DNase. Cell membranes were disrupted by sonication on ice and supernatants obtained following a 30-min centrifugation at 50,000 × g were loaded onto a Ni-chelating column. Protein was eluted with buffer A containing 200 mm imidazole. FERM domain-containing fractions were pooled and the His6 tag was cleaved by incubation with 1 μg of tobacco etch virus protease per mg of protein overnight at 4 °C. The concentration of NaCl was reduced to 50 mm by dilution, and the protein was loaded onto a HiTrap Q column and eluted with buffer A containing 500 mm NaCl. The FERM domain was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 75 size exclusion column previously equilibrated in buffer A containing 100 mm NaCl. The eluted FERM domain of FAK was greater than 95% pure as estimated by SDS-PAGE and was concentrated to 6–10 mg/ml and stored at –70 °C. Selenomethionine (SeMet)-substituted protein was prepared using the methionine auxotroph B834(DE3) strain. Cells were grown in M9 minimal media supplemented with SeMet (40 μg/ml). The subsequent steps for SeMet-labeled FERM domain proceeded as described for the native protein. Crystallization and Data Collection—Protein crystals of FAK399 (residues 31–399 of avian FAK) were obtained by the hanging drop method using 6–10 mg/ml protein mixed in a 1:1 volume ratio with precipitation solution containing 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 16–22% polyethylene glycol 4000, 20% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 100 mm CsCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol. Crystals grew over 1–2 weeks at room temperature reaching maximum dimensions of 40 × 100 × 20 μm. Diffraction data were recorded to 2.5-Å resolution from a single, frozen native crystal with a monoclinic space group, P21 and unit cell parameters a = 44.2, b = 146.2, c = 68.9Å, β = 96.4°. Multiple anomalous diffraction data on a single, frozen, SeMet-derivatized FAK399 crystal was collected at the NSLS X12C beamline to 2.9-Å resolution (see Table 1 for details). Crystals of FAK405 (residues 31–405) were grown in 22.5% polyethylene glycol 4000, 0.1 m citrate, pH 5.5, 0.2 m ammonium acetate, 20% glycerol, and in the presence of 1:2 molar ratio of inositol (1,4,5)P3. The phosphoinositide head group did not affect crystallization and is not present in the crystal structure. Diffraction data from a single frozen crystal with an orthorhombic space group (unit cell a = 50.54, b = 123.99, c = 133.93 Å) was collected at APS (14-ID-B) to 2.35-Å maximum resolution.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statistics for FAK FERM domain31-399 SeMet (multiple anomalous diffraction)31-399InflectionPeakRemote31-405Data collection Wavelength (Å)0.978970.97960.97930.950041.12714 Resolution (Å) (outer shell)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.30-2.5 (2.57-2.50)30-2.8 (2.9-2.8)30-2.8 (2.9-2.8)30-2.9 (3.0-2.9)30-2.35 (2.45-2.35) Space groupP21P21P21P21P212121 Total reflections139,555147,041147,59273,310274,336 Unique reflections29,89721,45621,50919,21035,886 Completeness (%)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.100 (100)98.7 (97.2)99.3 (97.9)99.4 (99.6)99.7 (99.9) I/σaValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.22.5 (2.7)24.6 (2.6)25.3 (3.0)15.7 (2.1)13.7 (2.7) Rmerge (%)aValues in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.,bRmerge = ΣhΣi|I(h,i)- 〈 |I(h) 〉|/ΣhΣi |I(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of h and 〈I(h) 〉 is the corresponding average value for all i measurements.0.073 (0.50)0.09 (0.76)0.088 (0.68)0.111 (0.79)0.038 (0.28)Figure of meritcFigure of merit = |ΣP(α)eiα[ρ]/ΣP |(α)|, where P(α) is the phase probability distribution and α is the phase. before/after DM0.39 for 20-2.9 Å/0.64 for 39-2.5 ÅRefinement Resolution range (Å)20-2.530-2.35 Reflections (free/test)27,037/1,40534,091/1,795 Rwork/Rfree (%)dRwork and Rfree = Σ∥Fo|-|Fc |∥/Σ|Fo| for the working set and test set (5%) of reflections.19.6/24.921.0/25.2 Protein5,3695,465 Water243155 r.m.s. bond length (Å)0.00580.0067 r.m.s. bond angles (°)1.161.15Average B-value (Å2) Protein50.650.6 Water48.747.8a Values in parentheses are for reflections in the highest resolution bin.b Rmerge = ΣhΣi|I(h,i)- 〈 |I(h) 〉|/ΣhΣi |I(h,i), where I(h,i) is the intensity of the ith measurement of h and 〈I(h) 〉 is the corresponding average value for all i measurements.c Figure of merit = |ΣP(α)eiα[ρ]/ΣP |(α)|, where P(α) is the phase probability distribution and α is the phase.d Rwork and Rfree = Σ∥Fo|-|Fc |∥/Σ|Fo| for the working set and test set (5%) of reflections. Open table in a new tab Structure Determination—The program SOLVE was used to determine the position of 10 selenium atoms from two copies of the FERM domain in the asymmetric unit in the FAK399 structure. The initial electron density map was improved by solvent flattening and phase-extension to 2.5-Å resolution using program DM (49Cowtan K. Zhang K. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 72: 245-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). A partial model was built automatically using the program ARP/wARP (50Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). The structure was completed and refined with several rounds of manual rebuilding using the program O and atomic refinement with CNS. The model was assessed using PROCHECK (51Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and waters were added by CNS. The refined model contains residues 33–363 of FAK, whereas residues 31–32 and 364–399 were not visible in the electron density maps and presumed to be disordered. The structure of FAK405 was phased by molecular replacement using the previously determined FAK399 FERM structure as the search model and the program Phaser (52McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2005; 61: 458-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1599) Google Scholar). Difference electron density maps revealed that the ordered portion of one of the two molecules in the asymmetric unit extended to residue 375, and also revealed density corresponding to residues 394–403 and 394–401 in the linker regions of the two molecules. These regions were built and the FAK405 structure was refined as described above for the FAK399 structure. Domain Mapping, Crystallization, and Structure Determination— The amino-terminal fragment of FAK (residues 1–405) containing the predicted FERM domain and autophosphorylation site Tyr397 was expressed in E. coli and purified. Limited proteolysis with the protease trypsin and amino-terminal sequencing of the resulting polypeptide identified a cleavage event that removed the NH2-terminal 28 residues of FAK (data not shown). Analysis of the FERM region of FAK and PYK2 from a number of species revealed that sequence conservation initiated with Arg35 (numbering refers to avian FAK). A truncated protein containing residues 31–399 (referred to here as FAK399) was generated and produced monoclinic crystals that diffracted x-rays to better than 2.5-Å resolution. The FAK399 structure was determined by multiwavelength anomalous diffraction methods using SeMet-substituted protein. We also obtained crystals with a longer construct spanning residues 31–405 (FAK405); this structure was determined by molecular replacement using the FAK399 structure as a model. The two structures are essentially the same; the only notable exception is that in the FAK405 structure, we observe electron density for a portion of the FERM-kinase linker corresponding to the Src SH3 binding site (residues 364 to 375) and for the segment containing the Tyr397 autophosphorylation site (residues 394–403). These segments are not ordered or completely present in the FAK399 crystals. Our description of the structure below is based upon the FAK399 crystals, but we refer explicitly to FAK399 or FAK405 as necessary for correctness and clarity. The FAK399 protein crystallized in monoclinic space group P21 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. The final model contains two molecules of the FERM domain and 243 water molecules and has been refined to an R value of 19.6% (Rfree = 24.9%) at 2.5-Å resolution with excellent stereochemistry (Table 1). The first 2 residues (Gly31-Ala32) and the COOH-terminal 37 residues (Lys364-Glu399) in each molecule are not visible in the electron density; this disordered region includes the Src SH3 binding site (Arg368-Pro374) and the Tyr397 phosphorylation site. FAK405 protein crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P212121, also with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Residues Ser307-Arg312, Leu376-Glu393, and Glu404-Asp405 were not observed in the electron density and are not included in the final model. The FAK405 structure has been refined to an R value of 21.0% (Rfree = 25.2%) with good stereochemistry (Table 1 and “Experimental Procedures”).

Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The three subdomains (labeled F1, F2, and F3) intimately associate with one another to form a compact structure with the overall shape of a cloverleaf. Each of the three lobes of the FERM domain bears striking similarity to otherwise unrelated single-domain protein structures as previously noted (43Pearson M.A. Reczek D. Bretshcer A. Karplus P.A. Cell. 2000; 101: 259-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The F1 lobe spans residues 33–127 and exhibits a ubiquitin-like fold (53Vijay-kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) consisting of a five-stranded β-sheet capped by an α-helix. The F2 subdomain (residues 128–253) is all α-helical and contains a core 4-helix bundle similar to that found in the acyl-CoA-binding protein (54Kragelund B.B. Anderson K.V. Madsen J.C. Knudsen J. Poulsen F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1260-1277Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The F3 lobe (residues 254–352) is a β-sandwich capped by a COOH-terminal α-helix that very closely resembles a pleckstrin homology domain. The pleckstrin homology domain shares the same three-dimensional fold with other modular signaling domains including phosphotyrosine binding and EVH1 domains in addition to the F3 lobe of the FERM domain (55Blomberg N. Baraldi E. Nilges M. Saraste M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 441-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). It has evolved distinct binding sites for diverse protein and phospholipid ligands (56Lemmon M.A. Keleti D. Cesareni G. Gimona M. Sudol M. Yaffe M. Modular Protein Domains. Wiley, New York2005: 337-357Crossref Google Scholar). Both phosphotyrosine binding domains and the F3 lobe of some FERM domains bind peptide ligands in a groove formed between one edge of the β-sandwich and the COOH-terminal α-helix. Interestingly, this groove is occupied in the FAK FERM domain by residues just COOH-terminal to the FERM domain in the FERM-kinase linker segment (Fig. 4). This interaction is observed in both FAK399 and FAK405 and is discussed more fully in a following section. The two protein molecules in the asymmetric unit are quite similar. They superimpose with a root mean square (r.m.s.) deviation of 0.9 Å over 330 amino acids. The only significant structural deviations in the two molecules are found in loop regions (the loop connecting α2 and α3 in the F2 lobe, the loop between strands β3 and β4, and the loop between strands β5 and β6 loop in the F3 lobe). Similarly, the FAK405 structure superimposes well with that of FAK399 (r.m.s. deviation of 1.2 Å for 324 equivalent residues). Both structures reveal a similar noncrystallographic dimer interface, but the con"

The enzyme is also one of the SULTs responsible for metabolic activation of mutagenic and carcinogenic compounds and therefore is implicated in various cancer forms. Further, it is not well understood how substrate inhibition takes place with rigid fused multiring substrates such as 17β-estradiol (E2) at high substrate concentrations when subcellular fractions or recombinant enzymes are used. To investigate how estradiol binds to SULT1A1, we co-crystallized SULT1A1 with sulfated estradiol and the cofactor product, PAP (3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphate). The crystal structure of SULT1A1 that we present here has PAP and one molecule of E2 bound in a nonproductive mode in the active site. The structure reveals how the SULT1A1 binding site undergoes conformational changes to accept fused ring substrates such as steroids. In agreement with previous reports, the enzyme shows partial substrate inhibition at high concentrations of E2.

SULT1A1 has a broad tissue distribution and has been shown to metabolize a wide range of xenobiotics and play a significant role in the metabolism of estrogens and iodothyronines. In resolving the crystal structure (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) of SULT1A1 we showed that it contains a very hydrophobic L-shaped substrate-binding region, which explains how it can accommodate small planar compounds as well as larger L-shaped aromatics such as iodothyronines. However, in those studies we could not explain how extended fused ring systems, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), can act as substrates of SULT1A1. In addition, no real information has been provided as to why the metabolism of E2 is inhibited at high concentrations of substrate when subcellular fractions or recombinant enzymes are employed as the catalytic sources. Recent studies from our laboratory on the crystal structure of SULT1A1 gave the first insight into understanding how substrate inhibition takes place with small planar substrates such as p-nitrophenol (pNP). In that study we showed that the active site of SULT1A1 is capable of binding two molecules of pNP simultaneously (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Further, we have demonstrated, using both molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, that SULT1A3 can bind two molecules of dopamine in its active site (12Barnett A.C. Tsvetanov S. Gamage N.U.

From these studies we have been able to conclude that substrate inhibition at high concentrations is caused by impeded catalysis when both binding sites are occupied. In the present study, we have determined the crystal structure of the SULT1A1·PAP·E2 complex. The results demonstrate how the enzyme adapts its substrate binding site to enable binding of the fused steroid ring system, supporting the notion of active site plasticity. The structure also reveals that E2 interacts in a nonproductive manner when co-crystallized with PAP. The relationship of this binding mode to the phenomenon of substrate inhibition that has been observed with E2 was investigated, and a general model of substrate inhibition, relevant to all SULTs with any substrate bound, has been proposed. Protein Expression and Purification—Human SULT1A1 cDNA was expressed in Escherichia coli as an N-terminal hexahistidine fusion protein, using a pET-28a(+) vector as described previously (13Brix L.A. Duggleby R.G. Gaedigk A. McManus M.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 337: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 14Bidwell L.M. McManus M.E. Gaedigk A. Kakuta Y. Negishi M. Pedersen L. Martin J.L. J.

The protein was purified by TALON cobalt affinity resin (Clontech) and gel filtration chromatography and then concentrated to 20 mg ml-1 in 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mm dithiothreitol. The purity of the protein was assessed using SDS-PAGE. Crystallization—Crystallization of SULT1A1 was carried out by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Initial conditions were identified using commercial (Hampton Research) and polyethylene glycol screens and optimized by incremental scanning around initial conditions. The optimized conditions for crystallization were as follows. Purified SULT1A1 (20 mg ml-1) was preincubated with 45 mm PAP and 5 mm estradiol or sulfated estradiol (β-estradiol 3-sulfate sodium salt in 70% N-methyl-d-glucamine) on ice for at least 30 min. Then, 1 μl of the protein solution was mixed with 1 μl of the well solution (0.1 m Tris-HCL, pH 8.0, 20% polyethylene glycol 4000) on a coverslip, placed over the well solution, and equilibrated at 20 °C. Crystals (∼0.3 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm) appeared 3-4 days after microseeding. X-ray Diffraction Data Measurement—Data were measured on an R-AXIS IV++/RU-200 x-ray generator with Osmic Blue mirror optics. Cryocooling was evaluated for data measurement. However, without added cryoprotectant the diffraction was weak and streaky. Increasing the polyethylene glycol concentration to 25% gave the same result. Dunking crystals into solutions containing cryoprotectant (glycerol) caused immediate crystal cracking, and stepwise soaking resulted in crystal cracking above 5% glycerol. Therefore, the diffraction data were measured at room temperature (17 °C); crystals were mounted in quartz capillary tubes, and diffraction data were measured to 2.3 Å resolution and processed with Crystal Clear© (Rigaku Corp.). Structure Determination—The structure of SULT1A1 (Protein Data Bank code 1LS6) with ligands pNP and PAP removed was used as the search model for phasing by molecular replacement. The molecular replacement solution from CNS (crystallography and NMR system) (16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P Grosse-Kunstleve R Jiang W. Kuszewski R.W. Nilges J. Pannu M.

Rigid body refinement of this solution gave initial R-factor and R-free values of 34.2 and 34.9%, respectively. Simulated annealing by cartesian molecular dynamics followed by B-factor refinement improved these values to 26.9 and 31.8%, respectively. After several rounds of model building in O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Residues 8-295 were modeled for both SULT1A1 molecules in the asymmetric unit, and each molecule contains a bound PAP and E2. 120 water molecules were included (TABLE ONE), and alternate conformations were modeled for the side chains of Glu166, Met260, and Cys287.

Acta. 1973; 327: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 20 μm [35S]PAPS, 0.1 μg/ml SULT1A1, and varying concentrations of E2. E2 was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and the maximum ethanol concentration used in the reaction mixture was 1% to prevent inhibition of the enzyme by ethanol. The final volume of the reaction mix was 500 μl. Reactions were initiated by adding the enzyme to the reaction mixture and incubating this mixture for 20 min at 37 °C. The sulfonation reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 m barium acetate, barium hydroxide, and zinc sulfate. Incubation times and protein concentrations used were within the linear range for product formation with E2 as the substrate. Assays were performed in duplicate, and background activity was corrected using controls with no substrate added. Radioactivity of the sulfonated E2 was measured using a liquid scintillation counter (Tri-Carb 2500, Packard). Molecular Modeling—To dock E2 in the catalytically productive mode, PAPS was modeled into the SULT1A1 structure based on the SULT1E1-PAPS structure (Protein Data Bank code 1HY3 (20Pedersen L.C. Petrotchenko E. Shevtsov S. Negishi M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17928-17932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). E2 was docked using GOLD (21Jones G. Willett P. Glen R.C. Leach A.R. Taylor R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 267: 727-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (5291) Google Scholar) with 10 genetic algorithm runs and default parameters. Figures were prepared using Molscript (22Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 940-950Crossref Google Scholar) and Raster 3d (23Merritt E.A. Bacon D. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 505-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (3873) Google Scholar). Structural comparisons of SULT1A1, mouse SULT1E1 (24Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and DHEA-ST (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) were performed using the lsq options of O (17Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjelgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13006) Google Scholar). DHEA-ST is referred to as SULT2A1, according to the new SULT nomenclature (26Blanchard R.L. Freimuth R.R. Buck J. Weinshilboum R.M. Coughtrie M.W.H. Pharmacogenetics. 2004; 14: 199-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the SULT1A1·PAP·E2 complex was solved to 2.3 Å resolution (Fig. 1). Crystals were orthorhombic (space group P21212 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit). The overall structure is similar to that for SULT1A1·PAP·pNP (Protein Data Bank code 1LS6 (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar)) with the core α/β domain found in all SULTs comprising a central five-stranded parallel β-sheet that forms the catalytic and PAPS binding sites (Fig. 1). The binding mode of the product, PAP, is similar to that described for the SULT1A1·PAP·pNP structure (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Substrate Binding Site—We first attempted to crystallize SULT1A1 with PAP and E2, but the bound conformation of E2 was not catalytically competent. Therefore, crystallization was repeated, replacing E2 with a saturating concentration of sulfonated E2 (E2S). However, E2 rather than E2S was again bound at the active site in a noncatalytic mode. NMR analysis of the sample revealed >90% E2S. This suggested that E2 is formed from E2S under the crystallization conditions. Could the enzyme catalyze the reverse reaction? Because E2S is a sulfate ester, whereas PAPS is an acid anhydride, thermodynamics would not favor the reverse reaction. However, a reasonable ΔGo′ of 15.5 kJ/mol under the conditions employed would allow formation of ∼0.6 mm E2, equal to the enzyme concentration used for crystallization. If E2 binds to the enzyme in preference to E2S, this would account for the formation of the observed complex. In addition, if the PAPS formed in this reverse reaction is hydrolyzed, it would push the equilibrium in this direction and thus increase the amount of E2 formed. Although PAPS is fairly stable, an accelerated breakdown by aminolysis might be expected (27Bedford C.T. Kirby A.J. Logan C.J. Drummond J.N. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1995; 3: 167-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) during crystallization, which in our experiment required incubation for several days in Tris buffer. The O-3 hydroxyl of E2 is the target for sulfonation by SULT1A1, but in the noncatalytic binding mode reported here, the O-3 atom is located very close to the cofactor product, PAP. In this mode, there is no room to model a sulfonate onto either PAP or E2. The E2 hydroxyl forms hydrogen bonds to the PAP phosphate (2.6 Å, Fig. 2A) and to the backbone nitrogen of Lys48 (3.2 Å, not shown). The superimposition of noncatalytic E2 with modeled E2 in a catalytically competent binding mode and with E2 from the SULT1E1 structure (24Kakuta Y. Pedersen L.G. Carter C.W. Negishi M Pedersen L.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 904-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) is also shown (Fig. 2A). E2 is shifted ∼2 Å toward PAP in the noncatalytic mode compared with the catalytic binding mode. The docked E2 has a binding mode similar to that observed in the SULT1E1 crystal structure (both are 2.9-3.0 Å from the catalytic His108). The binding pocket for E2 is well ordered in the SULT1A1 structure, and the substrate is surrounded by hydrophobic residues. As in the SULT1A1·PAP·pNP structure, Phe142 and Phe81 form a substrate access gate that permits binding of planar substrates. Kinetics of E2 Sulfonation by SULT1A1—SULT1A1 shows strong substrate inhibition by E2 (Fig. 3, A and B). The inhibition at high E2 concentrations can be explained in the following manner. For E2 to behave both as a substrate and a competitive inhibitor, binding in the productive and nonproductive orientations must be mutually exclusive. Using the standard equation for competitive inhibition, we get a+b v=Vm[E2]/{Km(1+[E2]/Ki)+[E2]} where Vm is the maximum rate, Km is the Michaelis constant for E2, and Ki is the inhibition constant for E2. This can be simplified to a+b v=Vmapp[E2]/{Kmapp+[E2]} where, a+b Vmapp=Vm/(1+Km/Ki) a+b Kmapp=Km/(1+Km/Ki) Thus, Michaelis-Menten kinetics will be followed in this situation, and substrate misorientation will be undetectable from the substrate saturation curve. The formation by SULTs of dead-end complexes, containing one of the substrates and one of the products, has been discussed previously (28Duffel M.W. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11123-11127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Yang Y-S. Tsai S.-W. Lin E.-S. Chem. Biol. Interact. 1998; 109: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 30Marshall A.D. McPhie P. Jakoby W.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 382: 95-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The existence of such complexes has been deduced from kinetic experiments, and the complex that is crystallized here is a direct demonstration of its existence. If this SULT·PAP·E2 complex forms during catalysis, it provides a ready explanation for substrate inhibition as depicted in the proposed mechanism (Fig. 3C). After substrate binding and catalysis, the SULT·PAP·E2S complex releases E2S. The SULT·PAP complex can then release PAP, to complete the catalytic cycle, or bind E2 in the nonproductive mode. The formation of this complex would be favored at high E2 concentration, resulting in substrate inhibition. However, we observed (Fig. 3, A and B) that substrate inhibition was incomplete, which suggests that this complex can reenter the catalytic pathway by release of PAP followed by release of E2. The rate equation for this situation (at saturating [PAPS]) is a+b v={Vm[E2]+Vlim[E2]2/Ki}/{Km+[E2]+[E2]2/Ki} where Vm, Km, and Ki are as described for Equation 1 and Vlim is the limiting rate at high [E2]. Fitting this equation to the data gives the kinetic constants shown in the legend to Fig. 3. There is excellent agreement between Equation 5 and the experimental data. It is of interest that the misoriented E2 is not a necessary feature of the model. If E2 was correctly oriented the SULT·E2 complex could move directly back into catalysis by binding PAPS to form SULT·PAPS·E2. In Fig. 3C, this corresponds to the reaction shown by the broken line. The rate equation for this alternative model is the same as Equation 5. We emphasize that the structure we have determined containing one of the substrates (E2) and one of the products (PAP) (Fig. 2A) is a dead-end complex rather than an intermediate on the normal catalytic pathway. Formation of this complex during catalysis, by binding of the substrate E2 before PAP is released, is the reason that there is substrate inhibition. The misorientation of E2 in this complex is a secondary consequence arising because neither E2 nor PAP has a sulfonate group. This allows E2 to penetrate further into the active site and to form hydrogen bonds to PAP and the backbone of Lys48. Substrate inhibition results because the dead-end complex can form and would still be expected even if E2 was oriented correctly. Human SULT1A1 is involved in detoxification and bioactivation of a broad range of substrates including iodothyronines, hydroxyaryl amines, estrogens, and phenolic xenobiotics. These substrates can be small planar aromatics (phenols), large L-shaped aromatics (iodothyronines), or extended planar aromatic ring systems (estrogen, hydroxylamines, and heterocyclic hydroxylamines). The crystal structure of SULT1A1 and modeling studies have shown how small planar molecules such as pNP and L-shaped aromatics (iodothyronines) can bind to the active site (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) but have not explained how extended multi-ring systems such as E2 interact with the enzyme. We proposed that the SULT1A1 active site is plastic and adopts various shapes to accept different types of molecules (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported an L-shaped binding site in the structure when SULT1A1 was crystallized with pNP (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). However, E2 has a fused ring system that cannot adopt an L-shaped conformation. Instead, a conformational change in the binding site of the enzyme extends the accessible surface to allow binding of the fused ring substrate. Two loop regions that close tightly over the SULT1A1·pNP complex are opened up in the present structure (Fig. 2B, residues 146-154 between α6 and α7, and particularly residues 84-90 just preceding α4), increasing the space available for E2 binding. Another flexible region is the loop that connects α12 and α13 in SULT1A1; this loop covers the substrate upon binding and is involved in several direct contacts with bound E2. Phe247 is located in this loop and appears to play an important role in E2 binding in SULT1A1. When 3,3′-diiodothyronine (T2) was modeled into the SULT1A1 structure, a catalytically competent binding mode was possible only if Phe247 adopted an alternate rotamer conformation (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). We showed, using molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, that this residue also plays an important role in substrate inhibition of SULT1A1 (12Barnett A.C. Tsvetanov S. Gamage N.U. Martin J.L. Duggleby R.G. McManus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18799-18805Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the present structure we observed that Phe247 does indeed adopt a conformation different from that in the SULT1A1·pNP crystal structure, thereby increasing the space available to bind the fused ring structure of the steroid. A characteristic feature of SULTs is substrate inhibition at high concentrations of their preferred substrates (31Raftogianis R.B. Wood T.C. Weinshilboum R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 32Reiter C. Mwaluko G. Dunnette J. Loon Van Weinshilboum J.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1983; 324: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). We have proposed a kinetic model for pNP substrate inhibition in SULT1A1 based on the crystallographic evidence of two pNP molecules in the active site (11Gamage N.U. Duggleby R.G. Barnett A.C. Tresillian M. Latham C.F. Liyou N.E. McManus M.E. Martin J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7655-7662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). In that structure, one pNP molecule is in the correct position for sulfonation, whereas the second pNP molecule blocks the channel that leads to the active site. This suggests impeded catalysis when both binding sites are occupied. When only the second pNP is bound, access to the catalytic residues is likely be blocked. We proposed that it is the combination of these two events that gives rise to the substrate inhibition in SULT1A1 with pNP. The crystal structure of SULT2A1 revealed that the substrate steroid DHEA can bind in either a productive or nonproductive mode (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In the productive or catalytic orientation, DHEA has the O-3 hydroxyl positioned correctly for catalysis with respect to His99 and a modeled PAP. The alternative orientation places O-3 2.9 Å away and closer to the modeled PAP. The two binding modes overlap so that, in the absence of PAPS, the binding of DHEA in the productive and nonproductive modes must be mutually exclusive; only one DHEA molecule can be present in the active site at any given time, and it is likely that the ligand can adopt each orientation with similar probability. Rehse et al. (25Rehse P.H. Zhou M. Lin S.X. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 165-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) suggested that the alternative binding orientation could be the source of substrate inhibition in this enzyme, but our analysis (Equations 2-4) shows that this would not result in substrate inhibition (characterized by a decreasing rate with increasing substrate concentration, compare Equations 2-4 with Equation 5). As the substrate concentration increases, the amounts of productive and nonproductive modes would increase in the same proportion to one another, whereas substrate inhibition would require a relative increase in the proportion of the nonproductive mode. We observed a nonproductive substrate orientation for E2 in SULT1A1, resembling the orientation for DHEA in SULT2A1, except that there is also a 45° rotation of the DHEA steroid with respect to the catalytic orientation (Fig. 4). Our explanation for substrate inhibition is that E2 binds to the SULT1A1·PAP complex after catalysis and release of E2S (Fig. 3). The resulting complex is the one that we have crystallized, providing clear evidence that such an entity exists. This complex is capable of releasing PAP but more slowly than it would be released without bound E2. However, in the presence of PAPS, SULT1A1 binds E2 in a catalytically competent mode that allows transfer of sulfonate from the cofactor to E2, as shown in Fig. 2A. This model explains the observed partial substrate inhibition of SULT1A1 by E2 and provides a more general explanation for the substrate inhibition that appears to be a common feature of SULTs."
https://openalex.org/W2013110945,"There is growing evidence that members of the extended Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones, including the Hsp110 and Grp170 subgroups, collaborate in vivo to carry out essential cellular processes. However, relatively little is known regarding the interactions and cellular functions of Sse1, the yeast Hsp110 homolog. Through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that Sse1 forms heterodimeric complexes with the abundant cytosolic Hsp70s Ssa and Ssb in vivo. Furthermore, these complexes can be efficiently reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins. Binding of Ssa or Ssb to Sse1 was mutually exclusive. The ATPase domain of Sse1 was found to be critical for interaction as inactivating point mutations severely reduced interaction with Ssa and Ssb. Sse1 stimulated Ssa1 ATPase activity synergistically with the co-chaperone Ydj1, and stimulation required complex formation. Ssa1 is required for post-translational translocation of the yeast mating pheromone α-factor into the endoplasmic reticulum. Like ssa mutants, we demonstrate that sse1Δ cells accumulate prepro-α-factor, but not the co-translationally imported protein Kar2, indicating that interaction between Sse1 and Ssa is functionally significant in vivo. These data suggest that the Hsp110 chaperone operates in concert with Hsp70 in yeast and that this collaboration is required for cellular Hsp70 functions. There is growing evidence that members of the extended Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones, including the Hsp110 and Grp170 subgroups, collaborate in vivo to carry out essential cellular processes. However, relatively little is known regarding the interactions and cellular functions of Sse1, the yeast Hsp110 homolog. Through co-immunoprecipitation analysis, we found that Sse1 forms heterodimeric complexes with the abundant cytosolic Hsp70s Ssa and Ssb in vivo. Furthermore, these complexes can be efficiently reconstituted in vitro using purified proteins. Binding of Ssa or Ssb to Sse1 was mutually exclusive. The ATPase domain of Sse1 was found to be critical for interaction as inactivating point mutations severely reduced interaction with Ssa and Ssb. Sse1 stimulated Ssa1 ATPase activity synergistically with the co-chaperone Ydj1, and stimulation required complex formation. Ssa1 is required for post-translational translocation of the yeast mating pheromone α-factor into the endoplasmic reticulum. Like ssa mutants, we demonstrate that sse1Δ cells accumulate prepro-α-factor, but not the co-translationally imported protein Kar2, indicating that interaction between Sse1 and Ssa is functionally significant in vivo. These data suggest that the Hsp110 chaperone operates in concert with Hsp70 in yeast and that this collaboration is required for cellular Hsp70 functions. Cells respond to protein-denaturing stresses such as heat by rapidly inducing expression of a wide array of heat shock genes. Chief among these are the molecular chaperones, highly conserved proteins that associate with and protect unfolded proteins, preventing their aggregation and supporting refolding (1Hartl F.U. Hayer-Hartl M. Science. 2002; 295: 1852-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2765) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most abundant and well characterized chaperones are the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) 2The abbreviations used are: Hsp70heat shock protein 70DTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidSsastress seventy AERendoplasmic reticulumPGKphosphoglycerate kinaseppαFprepro-α-factor.2The abbreviations used are: Hsp70heat shock protein 70DTTdithiothreitolMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidSsastress seventy AERendoplasmic reticulumPGKphosphoglycerate kinaseppαFprepro-α-factor. family, found in all cell types from bacteria to eukaryotes (2Mayer M.P. Brehmer D. Gassler C.S. Bukau B. Adv. Protein Chem. 2001; 59: 1-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 3Craig E.A. Gambill B.D. Nelson R.J. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 402-414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hsp70s assist in protein refolding by binding of exposed hydrophobic surfaces of a substrate to a C-terminal peptide binding domain. Cycles of substrate binding and release are brought about by transition between low and high affinity binding states regulated by nucleotide occupancy in the N-terminal ATPase domain (4Slepenkov S.V. Witt S.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar).In eukaryotic cells Hsp70 class chaperones can be divided into three subfamilies: 1) DnaK-like, 2) Hsp110, and 3) Grp170 (5Easton D.P. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 276-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, possesses 14 Hsp70 homologs with family members present in the cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria (6James P. Pfund C. Craig E.A. Science. 1997; 275: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The most well studied Hsp70s in yeast are the cytoplasmic Ssa proteins (stress seventy A), encoded by the differentially expressed SSA1-4 genes. Ssa1-4 (collectively referred to as “Ssa”) perform largely redundant functions and the presence of at least one SSA gene is required for viability (7Werner-Washburne M. Stone D.E. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1987; 7: 2568-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Ssa chaperones are involved in cellular processes such as translation, translocation of proteins across cellular membranes, and general protein folding (8Frydman J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 603-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Cells depleted of Ssa exhibit multiple cellular defects, including: (i) growth arrest in G2/M phase, (ii) accumulation of precursor proteins destined for the ER and mitochondria, (iii) abnormal nuclear distribution, and (iv) aberrant microtubule formation (9Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 10Oka M. Nakai M. Endo T. Lim C.R. Kimata Y. Kohno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29727-29737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Ssa ATPase activity, and therefore protein folding capacity, is in turn governed by modulatory proteins such as the DnaJ homolog, Ydj1, which stimulates ATPase activity up to 10-fold, and Fes1, recently identified as a nucleotide exchange factor (11Kabani M. Beckerich J.M. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 4677-4689Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 12Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Sti1 and Cns1, two tetratricopeptide repeat proteins associated with the Hsp90 chaperone complex, were recently demonstrated to strongly activate Ssa1 (13Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Hainzl O. Wegele H. Richter K. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23267-23273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Another pair of Hsp70 proteins in yeast, functionally distinct from the Ssa chaperones, are encoded by SSB1 and SSB2. Ssb1/2 are associated with both the ribosome and nascent chains emerging from the ribosomal exit channel (15Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Strains lacking SSB1/2 are cold-sensitive and exhibit enhanced sensitivity to translational inhibitors, indicative of a role in translation (16Nelson R.J. Ziegelhoffer T. Nicolet C. Werner-Washburne M. Craig E.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 97-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). Thus far, Ssb has not been shown to bind peptide substrates in vitro, nor is it stimulated by classic Hsp70 substrates (17Pfund C. Huang P. Lopez-Hoyo N. Craig E.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 3773-3782Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the ribosome-associated complex (RAC), a heterodimer composed of the Hsp70 Ssz1 and the J-protein Zuo1, potently and specifically activates Ssb ATPase activity (18Huang P. Gautschi M. Walter W. Rospert S. Craig E.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 19Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4209-4214Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 20Hundley H. Eisenman H. Walter W. Evans T. Hotokezaka Y. Wiedmann M. Craig E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 4203-4208Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar).Unlike the ubiquitous DnaK Hsp70 subfamily, the Hsp110 molecular chaperones are found only in eukaryotic cells. The defining characteristics of the Hsp110 family are an extended linker region (∼98 residues versus ∼9 in Hsp70) separating the β-sandwich peptide binding fold from the α-helical lid domain, and an extended C-terminal tail region whose structure and function is unknown (5Easton D.P. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 2000; 5: 276-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Importantly, Hsp110 cannot actively refold proteins but is able to hold thermally denatured model substrates such as luciferase in a protected state such that they can be more efficiently renatured by folding-competent chaperones such as Hsp70 (21Oh H.J. Easton D. Murawski M. Kaneko Y. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15712-15718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Because of this property, Hsp110 is classified as a “holdase,” similar to Hsp90 and many of its co-chaperones, rather than a “foldase.” In contrast to the Hsp70s, very little is known about Hsp110 in vivo functions. Overexpression of mammalian Hsp110 in Rat-1 and HeLa cells confers increased thermoresistance (22Oh H.J. Chen X. Subjeck J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31636-31640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Recently, overexpression of Hsp110 was found to suppress cell toxicity caused by induction of the polyglutamine tract-containing truncated androgen receptor (tAR) in COS-7 cells (23Ishihara K. Yamagishi N. Saito Y. Adachi H. Kobayashi Y. Sobue G. Ohtsuka K. Hatayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25143-25150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with the general chaperone activity demonstrated in vitro, but to date, no endogenous cellular targets have been identified.The Hsp110 family is represented in S. cerevisiae by the Sse1 and Sse2 proteins. Loss of SSE1 renders cells slow growing and temperature-sensitive, whereas loss of SSE2 causes no observable phenotypes (24Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, in some strain backgrounds SSE1 and SSE2 may constitute an essential gene pair, as inactivation of both genes is lethal (25Trott A. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Like mammalian Hsp110, Sse1 acts as a holdase in vitro, binding to denatured substrates, preventing aggregation and enhancing renaturation by folding-competent chaperones (26Brodsky J.L. Werner E.D. Dubas M.E. Goeckeler J.L. Kruse K.B. McCracken A.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3453-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Sse1 was isolated as a calmodulin-binding protein and is required for modulation of protein kinase A signaling (24Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 25Trott A. Shaner L. Morano K.A. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Shirayama M. Kawakami K. Matsui Y. Tanaka K. Toh-e A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 323-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Sse1 also functions as an Hsp90 co-chaperone and is required for full function of several client proteins (28Liu X.D. Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, the molecular role Sse1 plays in the Hsp90 chaperone cycle has not been elucidated. Sse1 was recently shown to function in vivo by a mechanism likely distinct from that of Hsp70; multiple ATPase domain mutations previously demonstrated to inactivate both Kar2 and Ssa1 had no phenotypic effect on Sse1 (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Moreover, the ATPase and peptide binding domains of Sse1 exhibit trans-complementation in vivo and functionally interact, suggesting that the chaperone may exist in higher order complexes (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hsp110 in mammalian cells has been reported to form large complexes (400-700 kDa) with Hsp70 and Hsp25 chaperones (30Wang X.Y. Chen X. Oh H.J. Repasky E. Kazim L. Subjeck J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 465: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Ishihara K. Yasuda K. Hatayama T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1444: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition, the Hsp105α isoform was recently demonstrated to inhibit ATPase activity of Hsc70 (32Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Hatayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41727-41733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the functional significance of this interaction in vivo is unknown. Similarly, a recent report demonstrated that Kar2 and the Grp170 subfamily member, Lhs1 interact and reciprocally regulate both ATPase activities. This biochemical effect has functional significance, as mutation of Lhs1 severely impairs the ability of Kar2 to support post-translational translocation of prepro-α-factor (ppαF) (33Steel G.J. Fullerton D.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Science. 2004; 303: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar).In this report, we demonstrate that Sse1 exists in heterodimeric complexes with the Ssa and Ssb chaperones. Using purified proteins, we show that the dimeric complexes are able to form in vitro in the absence of additional yeast components. The ATPase domain of Sse1 appears to be important for this interaction, as several inactivating point mutants in this domain block complex formation. Sse1 stimulates Ssa1 ATPase activity in steady-state assays synergistically with Ydj1, and this stimulation requires stable complex formation. Similar to cells depleted of Ssa, sse1Δ cells accumulate ppαF, indicating a potential role for Sse1 with Ssa in mediating protein translocation. Together, these results demonstrate a functional interaction between cytosolic Hsp110 and Hsp70 protein chaperones in yeast.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study were W303 (MATa ura3-52 trp1 leu2-3,112 his3-11,15 ade2-1 can1-100), sse1Δ(W303 sse1Δ::kanMX), ssb1/2Δ (MATa ssb1::HIS3 ssb2::LEU2, lys1, lys2, leu2-3,112, ura3-52, his3-11,15, trp1-Δ1), JN516 (MATα his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-Δ1 lys2 SSA1 ssa2::LEU2 ssa3::TRP1 ssa4::LYS2) and JB67 (MATα his3-11,15 leu2-3,112 ura3-52 trp1-Δ1 lys2 ssa1::ssa1-45 ssa2::LEU2 ssa3::TRP1 ssa4::LYS2). Strains RSY1293 (MATα can 1-100 leu2-3,-112 his3-11,-15 trp1-1 ura3-1 ade2-1 sec61::HIS3 [pDQ1]) and RSY1295 (RSY1293 except (psec61-41)) were obtained from R. Schekman (UC Berkeley) (34Pilon M. Schekman R. Romisch K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking the appropriate nutrient for plasmid selection was purchased from BIO101 (Carlsbad, CA). Standard yeast propagation and transformation procedures were employed. Isogenic MATα variants of W303 and sse1Δ strains were generated by mating type switching the with the pGALHO plasmid (35Herskowitz I. Jensen R.E. Guthrie C. Fink G. Methods in Enzymology. 1991: 132-146Google Scholar). FLAG-Sse1 and mutant derivatives were overexpressed in BL21 Escherichia coli (B F-, ompT, hsdS (rB-,mB-), gal, dcm) (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant FLAG-Sse1 proteins were expressed in yeast from the low copy plasmid p416TEF (36Mumberg D. Muller R. Funk M. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 156: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1569) Google Scholar).Immunoblot Analysis—SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis was performed as described (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Anti-Sse1 polyclonal antibody was used at 1:2000 dilution (obtained from J. Brodsky, University of Pittsburgh). Anti-Ssa1/2 polyclonal antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution. Anti-Ssb1/2 polyclonal antibody was used at 1:5000 dilution (both obtained from E. Craig, University of Wisconsin). M2 monoclonal antibody (recognizes FLAG epitope, Sigma) was used at 1:1000 dilution. Anti-Kar2 polyclonal antibody was used at 1:1000 dilution (obtained from J. Gaut, University of Michigan). Anti-ppαF antibody was used at 1:2000 dilution (obtained from R. Schekman, UC, Berkeley). Anti-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) monoclonal antibody (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used at 1:1000 dilution.Immunoprecipitation Analysis and Native-PAGE—For immunoprecipitation of FLAG-Sse1 complexes from yeast, soluble protein extracts were prepared from 20 ml of mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5) cultures of the appropriate strains expressing the wild-type and mutant FLAG-Sse1 fusions using the glass bead lysis method exactly as described (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of M2 resin (Sigma) in TEGN (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl) were added to protein extracts (∼1 mg of total protein). The volume was adjusted to 800 μl with TEGN followed by incubation with mixing at 4 °C for 2 h. Resin was then collected by centrifugation and washed four times with TEGN. For elution of bound proteins, 50 μl of 200 μg/ml FLAG peptide in TEGN was added to the resin pellet and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. For native PAGE, 6× native sample buffer (0.35 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 36% glycerol) was added to eluted protein samples. For SDS-PAGE, 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to eluted protein samples and boiled for 3 min. Native-PAGE was carried out using a previously described imidazole/HEPES (I/H) buffer system (43 mm imidazole, 35 mm HEPES) (37Tomashek J.J. Sonnenburg J.L. Artimovich J.M. Klionsky D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10397-10404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6% polyacrylamide gels made with I/H buffer were pre-run at 4 °C for 90 min followed by addition of fresh buffer and loading of samples. Samples were resolved at 90 V for 3 h. Gels were then either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblot analysis.Protein Purification—Ssa1 was either purified from yeast strain JN516 using the method of Cyr et al. (12Cyr D.M. Lu X. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20927-20931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or according to Wegele et al. (13Wegele H. Haslbeck M. Buchner J. J. Chromatogr. B Analyt. Technol. Biomed. Life Sci. 2003; 786: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). For purification of His6-Ssb1, plasmid p416TEF His6-SSB1 (kindly provided by E. Craig) was transformed into yeast strain W303 for expression. Protein was purified as described by Pfund et al. (15Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) with a 5-ml Talon resin column (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA) used for metal affinity chromatography in place of His-bind resin. Aliquots of purified protein at a concentration of 0.5 mg/ml were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. FLAG-Sse1 and the K69Q and G233D mutant proteins were overexpressed in E. coli as described. E. coli extracts containing overexpressed FLAG-Sse1 proteins were passed over 2 ml of M2 resin (Sigma) columns using gravity flow and washed with 15 ml of TEGN followed by elution with 10 ml of TEGN + 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. Eluted proteins were buffer-exchanged using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter Devices (Millipore) into Buffer 88 (20 mm HEPES pH 6.8, 150 mm KOAc, 5 mm MgOAc, and 250 mm sorbitol) and applied to a 2.5-ml Q-Sepharose column and washed and eluted as described (38McClellan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Genetics. 2000; 156: 501-512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Eluted proteins were again buffer exchanged with Amicon filters into Standard Buffer II (20 mm HEPES, pH 7, 200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 2.5% glycerol) and applied to a 160-ml Sephacryl S-300 column. FLAG-Sse1-containing fractions were buffer-exchanged, concentrated to 2 mg/ml using Amicon filters into Sse1 storage buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm DTT, 2 mm MgCl2, and 5% glycerol), aliquoted, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The YDJ1 open reading frame was cloned into pFLAG and overexpressed in E. coli as described above with FLAG-Sse1. FLAG-Ydj1 protein extracts were applied to a 2-ml M2 resin column, washed, and eluted as above. Eluted proteins were buffer exchanged with Amicon filters into Buffer A (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT) and applied to a 10-ml DE52 column (Whatman). Column was washed with 25 ml of Buffer A followed by elution with a 30-ml 0-300 mm NaCl gradient in Buffer A. FLAG-Ydj1 containing fractions were concentrated and buffer exchanged into Standard Buffer II and applied to a 160 mm Sephacryl S-300 column. Ydj1 containing fractions were buffer-exchanged and concentrated to 2 mg/ml into Buffer C (10 mm HEPES, pH 7, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT, 10% glycerol), aliquoted, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.ATPase Assay—All reactions were performed in a volume of 20 μl for 45 min at 30 °C in ATPase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES-KOH, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2,10mm DTT). For the Sse1 titration experiment, 3 μg of Ssa1 was preincubated with the indicated molar ratio of FLAG-Sse1 on ice for 60 min, followed by addition of 6 μg of FLAG-Ydj1, 50 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. For the steady-state ATPase assay, reactions contained 3 μg of Ssa, 6 μg of FLAG-Sse1 (or mutant versions), 6 μg of FLAG-Ydj1 in the combinations indicated. Reactions were stopped with 20 μl of Stop Buffer (2 m formic acid, 1 m LiCl) on ice. 1-μl aliquots were then spotted in duplicate on PEI-cellulose TLC plates and resolved in 1 m formic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. TLC plates were developed by phosphorimage analysis using a Storm 840 Imager and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). Spontaneous ATP hydrolysis and background hydrolysis from the Ydj1 preparation were subtracted. Percent conversion of ATP to ADP was then calculated. For Fig. 5A, values were normalized to the reaction containing Ssa1 and Ydj1 alone. In Fig. 5B, values were normalized to the reaction containing Ssa1 alone. Basal (unstimulated) activity of Ssa1 was near the limit of detection in our assay system with the protein amounts utilized. In pilot experiments, increasing amounts of Ssa1 produced greater ATPase activity, whereas increasing amounts of wild-type or mutant Sse1 proteins did not.Reconstitution of Sse1·Hsp70 Complexes in Vitro—For reconstitution studies, 200 μg of E. coli protein extract containing overexpressed FLAG-Sse1 was combined with 6 μg of purified Ssa1 or H6-Ssb1, 50 μl of a 1:1 slurry of M2 resin and adjusted to 800 μl with TEGN followed by incubation at 4 °C for 2 h. Resin was washed four times and eluted as described above. The eluate was divided into two equal portions and prepared for native- and SDS-PAGE as described above. To determine if Ssa and Ssb compete for binding to Sse1, 100 μg of FLAG-Sse1 and 200 μg of Ssa1 were incubated together on ice for 2 h and precipitated with M2 resin. The resin was washed and split evenly into five tubes. 0, 10, 25, 100, or 200 μg of His6-Ssb1 were added and incubated for 2 h on ice. Resin-bound complexes were washed and eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining.ppαF Accumulation Assay—Yeast strains JN516, JB67, and MATα mating type W303 and sse1Δ were grown at 24 °C in 50 ml of YPD to mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5). 25 ml were harvested and stored at -80 °C (t0). The remaining culture was then shifted to 39 °C for 30 min and harvested. Soluble protein was prepared by glass bead lysis as described previously (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins were resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to immunoblot analysis. In a separate experiment to investigate if co-translational import of Kar2 was affected in an sse1Δ mutant, JN516 and JB67 were grown at 30 °C to mid-log phase, half the culture shifted to 37 °C for 2 h, and extracts prepared from both cultures, while extracts were prepared from W303 and sse1Δ strains grown at 30 °C. As a control, a cold-sensitive sec61-41 mutant and its isogenic parent strain were shifted to 17 °C for 2 h to block all ER translocation. Extracts from all cultures were resolved on the same 8% SDS-PAGE gel and immunoblotted with anti-Kar2 antibody.RESULTSSsa1/2 and Ssb1/2 Co-immunoprecipitate with Sse1—As part of ongoing studies to elucidate the roles of Sse1 in yeast, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments to identify interacting proteins. For these experiments, a strain expressing a functional FLAG-tagged SSE1 allele was constructed. We have previously demonstrated that this modified protein is abundantly expressed, allowing facile immunoprecipitation and visualization by gel staining with Coomassie Blue dye (29Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). FLAG-Sse1 was affinity-purified using M2-agarose resin from soluble whole cell extracts, and proteins resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 1A, three bands were detected that were not present in the negative control lane lacking FLAG-Sse1. The band with the slowest mobility migrated slightly above 75 kDa, in agreement with the predicted size of FLAG-Sse1 (∼78 kDa). The other two proteins migrated very closely together at ∼70 kDa. Quantitation of all three bands suggested that the sum of the two 70-kDa band intensities was approximately equal to the intensity of FLAG-Sse1, consistent with the possibility that Sse1 may exist in one or more protein complexes at a near stoichiometric ratio. No other bands copurified with FLAG-Sse1.FIGURE 1Co-immunoprecipitation of the Hsp70 chaperones Ssa1/2 and Ssb1/2 with Sse1.

Acta. 1999; 1444: 138-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that the two 70-kDa proteins corresponded to yeast Hsp70s. Given the cytosolic localization of Sse1, the most likely candidates were the Ssa and Ssb chaperones. To test this possibility, immunoblot analysis of the precipitated proteins using antibodies specific to Sse1, Ssa1/2, and Ssb1/2 was employed, as shown in Fig. 1B. The anti-Ssa and anti-Ssb antisera are not capable of discriminating between the nearly identical isoforms of each class. As expected, the highest molecular mass band corresponded to FLAG-Sse1. The larger of the two ∼70-kDa bands reacted with anti-Ssa1/2 antibody, confirming the identity of this protein as either Ssa1 or Ssa2, although under these experimental conditions Ssa1 is likely to be more abundant. The faster migrating band reacted positively with anti-Ssb1/2 antibody. We did not observe co-purification of bacterial DnaK when FLAG-Sse1 was purified from E. coli cell extracts.To further confirm the identity of the two co-immunoprecipitated proteins, FLAG-Sse1 was immunoprecipitated from a yeast strain lacking both SSB1 and SSB2, as well as yeast strain JB67, lacking SSA2-4 and harboring a temperature-sensitive allele of SSA1 (ssa1-45) (9Becker J. Walter W. Yan W. Craig E.A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 4378-4386Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). When FLAG-Sse1 was precipitated from ssb1/2Δ cell extracts, the lower band could no longer be seen after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining, confirming the identity of the faster migrating band as that of Ssb1/2 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). We also noted the intensity of the remaining Ssa1/2 band increased significantly. The immunoprecipitation pattern from ssa1-45 extracts was identical to wild ty"
https://openalex.org/W2060496772,"The structurally related ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (ATM-Rad3-related) protein kinases fulfill overlapping yet non-redundant functions as key regulators of cellular DNA damage responses. We recently showed that ATM phosphorylates the cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, CREB, following exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and other DNA-damaging stimuli. Here, we show that a phospho-specific antibody recognizing the major ATM phosphorylation site in CREB cross-reacts with SV40 large tumor antigen (LTag), a multifunctional oncoprotein required for replication of the SV40 minichromosome. The relevant IR-induced phosphorylation site in LTag recognized by phospho-CREB antibody was mapped to Ser-120. IR strongly induced the phosphorylation of Ser-120 in an ATM-dependent manner in mouse embryo fibroblasts. Infection of African green monkey CV1 cells with SV40 resulted in the activation of ATM and phosphorylation of LTag and endogenous ATM substrates. Infection-induced LTag phosphorylation correlated with the onset of DNA replication, was ATM-dependent, and peaked when viral DNA levels reached their maximum. SV40 replication in CV1 cells required an intact LTag Ser-120 phosphorylation site and was inhibited following transfection with ATM small interfering RNA suggesting that ATM is required for optimal SV40 replication in primate cells. Our findings uncover a direct link between ATM and SV40 LTag that may have implications for understanding the replication cycle of oncogenic polyoma viruses."
https://openalex.org/W2062602107,"Notch signaling is a component of a wide variety of developmental processes in many organisms. Notch activity can be modulated by O-fucosylation (mediated by protein O-fucosyltransferase-1) and Fringe, a β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase that modifies O-fucose in the context of epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats. Fringe was initially described in Drosophila, and three mammalian homologues have been identified, Manic fringe, Lunatic fringe, and Radical fringe. Here for the first time we have demonstrated that, similar to Manic and Lunatic, Radical fringe is also a fucose-specific β1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. The fact that three Fringe homologues exist in mammals raises the question of whether and how these enzymes differ. Although Notch contains numerous EGF repeats that are predicted to be modified by O-fucose, previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that not all O-fucosylated EGF repeats of Notch are further modified by Fringe, suggesting that the Fringe enzymes can differentiate between them. In this work, we have sought to identify specificity determinants for the recognition of an individual O-fucosylated EGF repeat by the Fringe enzymes. We have also sought to determine differences in the biochemical behavior of the Fringes with regard to their in vitro enzymatic activities. Using both in vivo and in vitro experiments, we have found two amino acids that appear to be important for the recognition of an O-fucosylated EGF repeat by all three mammalian Fringes.

The Notch protein is a transmembrane receptor involved in various cell fate decisions. It was initially characterized in Drosophila and has subsequently been found in all known metazoans (1Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Rand M.D. Lake R.J. Science. 1999; 284: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (4951) Google Scholar). Notch becomes activated upon binding to its ligands located on apposing cells. These ligands, known collectively as the DSL (for Delta-Serrate-Lag2) family, fall into two classes, Serrate/Jagged and Delta. A large portion of the extracellular domain of Notch is composed of epidermal growth factor (EGF) 3The abbreviations used are: EGFepidermal growth factor-likeBnz-fucbenzyl-α-O-fucoseMfngManic fringeLfngLunatic fringeRfngRadical fringeDfngDrosophila fringeO-FucT-1protein O-fucosyltransferase-1CHOChinese hamster ovaryHPAEChigh pH anion exchange chromatographyNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acidMS/MSmass spectrometry/mass spectrometryHPLChigh pressure liquid chromatography.-like repeats, and many of these EGF repeats contain consensus sites for modification by O-fucose (a process mediated by the protein O-fucosyltransferase-1 (O-FucT-1) (2Moloney D.J.

Some of these O-fucosylated EGF repeats can be further modified by the actions of Fringe, a β1,3-GlcNAc transferase (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y.

Cell. 1994; 79: 595-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Further studies reveal that Fringe functions specifically by modulating the response of Notch to its ligands, potentiating Delta signaling while inhibiting Serrate signaling (10Panin V.M. Papayannopoulos V. Wilson R. Irvine K.D. Nature. 1997; 387: 908-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar, 11Fleming R.J. Gu Y. Hukriede N.A.

Three mammalian homologues to Drosophila Fringe (Dfng) have been identified, Manic fringe (Mfng), Lunatic fringe (Lfng), and Radical fringe (Rfng). Lfng and Rfng are known to play important roles in developmental processes in vertebrates. For example, disruption of Lfng expression in chick or mouse embryos severely disrupts the formation of somitic borders (13Dale J.K. Maroto M. Dequeant M.L. Malapert P. McGrew M. Pourquie O. Nature. 2003; 421: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 14Zhang N. Gridley T. Nature. 1998; 394: 374-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar, 15Zhang N. Norton C.R. Gridley T. Genesis. 2002; 33: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In mice lacking Lfng, there is increased perinatal death due to rib malformation. Mice that survive into adulthood display multiple defects related to somitogenesis (malformation of the vertebral column and ribs, fusion of the neural arches, and shortened tails). Rfng also functions in chick wing development (16Grammont M. Irvine K.D. Development (Camb.). 2001; 128: 2243-2253Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Rodriguez-Esteban C. Schwabe J.W. De La Pena J. Foys B. Eshelman B. Izpisua Belmonte J.C. Nature. 1997; 386: 360-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). In contrast, Rfng knock-outs in mice exhibit no obvious phenotype, and Lfng/Rfng double knock-outs in mice display phenotypes similar to those observed in Lfng knock-outs (15Zhang N. Norton C.R. Gridley T. Genesis. 2002; 33: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Data regarding knock-out of Mfng in mice is not currently available. Characterization of Dfng, Lfng, and Mfng has revealed that these enzymes are fucose-specific β1,3-GlcNAc transferases (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 5Bruckner K. Perez L. Clausen H. Cohen S. Nature. 2000; 406: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). No data on the enzymatic activity of Rfng has yet been reported. Dfng, Lfng, and Mfng all require manganese for activity, as is the case for most other glycosyltransferases, and utilize uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as a donor substrate (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Little else is known about their specificity. The question of whether and how these enzymes differ is important for a complete understanding of how they modulate the Notch-signaling pathway. Furthermore, although Notch contains numerous EGF repeats that are modified by O-fucose, not all are subsequently modified by one of the Fringes (i.e. Fringes show a preference for some fucosylated EGF repeats over others) (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The information necessary for the Fringes to differentiate between O-fucosylated EGF repeats appears to be encoded in the EGF repeats themselves (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the question of how the Fringe enzymes differentiate between O-fucosylated EGF repeats remains. Here we have begun to examine the specificity determinants for the recognition of individual O-fucosylated EGF repeats by the Fringe enzymes. We have also demonstrated that Rfng is indeed a fucose-specific β1,3-N-GlcNAc transferase (similar to Lfng and Mfng (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar)), and we have sought to determine the differences in the biochemical behavior of Lfng, Rfng, and Mfng with regard to their in vitro enzymatic activities. Preparation of Constructs—Amino acids 93-129 of human factor IX and amino acids 106-147 of human factor VII were cloned into pSecTag2 (Invitrogen) using the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites. pSecTag2 encodes an Igκ signal sequence for secretion and C-terminal Myc and hexahistidine tags. Point mutations were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with wild-type factor VII and factor IX pSecTag2 constructs as templates. Constructs for expression of the mouse Fringe enzymes were produced by amplification from constructs containing the full-length sequence of each enzyme (generously provided by Dr. Tom Vogt (18Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). In the case of Lfng and Rfng, sequences corresponding to the predicted lumenal domain (as described in Ref. 18Johnston S.H. Rauskolb C. Wilson R. Prabhakaran B. Irvine K.D. Vogt T.F. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 2245-2254Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pSecTag2 (Invitrogen). The mature peptide corresponds to amino acids 86-378 (Lfng) and 39-332 (Rfng). The primers used for amplification of Lfng were: forward, 5′-GCATATCATAAAGCTTTACAGAGGATGATACAGGGCGCG-3′ and reverse, 3′-TATATATCTCGAGCGGGCGCTGCCAGCGGACA-5′. The products were digested with HindIII and XhoI and subcloned into pSecTag2 (restriction sites on primers are underlined). Primers used for amplification of Rfng were: forward, 5′-GCATATCATAAAGCTTTACCGGACCCCGATCGGCTC-3′ and reverse, 3′-AAGCGGATATCCCCTGGAAAGCTCCCTCAACCCT-5′. The products were digested with HindIII and EcoRV and subcloned into pSecTag2. In the case of Mfng, the full-length sequence was used (including the endogenous signal sequence/transmembrane domain, amino acids 1-31), as attempts to express the protein using the predicted lumenal domain cloned into pSecTag2 failed. The primers used for extension were: forward, 5′-TTTAAACTTAAGCTTATGCACTGCCGACTTTTT-3′ and reverse, 3′-GAAGGGCCCTCTAGAGGGGCGTGCCAGCGGACA-5′. The products were digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into pCDNA4 (Invitrogen); this plasmid also encodes C-terminal Myc and hexahistidine tags. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For bacterial expression of EGF repeats, pET20b (Novagen) constructs encoding the first EGF repeat from human factor IX (amino acids 93-129) and factor IX bearing a double mutation were created using the constructs described above. Sequences were amplified from these constructs and subcloned into pET20b vector using BamHI and XhoI restriction sites in-frame with the pelB signal sequence for bacterial expression. The pET20b constructs were generated by the Stony Brook University Cloning Center and confirmed by sequencing. A pET20b construct encoding mouse Notch1 EGF 26 was similarly created using a previously reported pSecTag2 construct of EGF 26 (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Cell Lines—The Lec1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line (19Stanley P. Siminovitch L. Somatic Cell Genet. 1977; 3: 391-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Lec1-CHO cells were developed by the laboratory of Dr. Pamela Stanley (Albert Einstein College of Medicine). Lec1-CHO cells were grown in α-minimum essential medium (MEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% calf serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Metabolic Labeling—Lec1-CHO cells were transiently transfected with pSecTag2 constructs encoding the first EGF repeat of human clotting factors VII or IX or versions of these plasmids containing point mutants as described previously (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfection was accomplished using Geneporter (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Following transfection, the cells were incubated with 20 μCi/ml [6-3H]fucose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) in α-MEM/10% calf serum for 48 h. Proteins were purified from medium using Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen), and O-glycans were released by alkali-induced β elimination and analyzed by gel filtration chromatography as previously described (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar, 20Moloney D.J.

Purification of Fringe Enzyme—Constructs encoding each of the mouse Fringe enzymes were transfected into Lec1-CHO cells using Geneporter reagent (Gene Therapy Systems) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Stable transfectants were selected by the addition of 680 μg/ml hygromycin B (Calbiochem) (Lfng and Rfng) or 250 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) (Mfng) and identified by dilution cloning. The expression levels of different clones were determined by immunoblot of the medium using an anti-hexahistidine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and clones expressing the highest level of protein were identified. Cells were grown to confluency in 100-mm dishes with α-MEM supplemented with 10% calf serum. Subsequently, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed once with 5 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.15 m NaCl (TBS) and then switched to 10 ml of OptiMEM (Invitrogen) for ∼60 h. The medium was collected and clarified by centrifugation and then incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) for 1 h at 4°C with rotation. Approximately 60 μl of Ni-NTA-agarose were used/ml of medium. The slurry was poured into a 0.8 × 4-cm Bio-Rad disposable column, and the Ni-NTA-agarose was then washed sequentially with 10 volumes of 0.5 m NaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), followed by 10 volumes of TBS and three 1-ml aliquots of 25 mm imidazole in TBS. Protein was eluted with 5 1-ml aliquots of 50 mm imidazole in TBS. Aliquots of elutions were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and immunoblot with mouse anti-hexahistidine antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The identity of enzymes was confirmed by proteomic analysis. Briefly, protein samples were reduced in SDS sample buffer (lacking reducing agents) using 10 mm Tris (2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (Pierce) for 5 min at 95 °C and then carboxyamidomethylated with 30 mm iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark prior to loading onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The band corresponding to Lfng, Rfng, or Mfng was identified after staining the gel with Gel Stain (Pierce), cutting it out, and subjecting it to in-gel digestion with modified trypsin (Promega), essentially as described previously (21Li G. Yan Q. Nita-Lazar A. Haltiwanger R.S. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1864-1871Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The resulting peptides were extracted from the gel pieces and desalted on a C18 ZipTip microcolumn (Millipore). The peptides were then fractionated by reversed phase liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry using a Zorbax C8 capillary column (0.3 × 150 mm diameter) (Agilent) with a 60-min linear gradient from 0 to 95% Buffer B (Buffer A = 0.1% formic acid; Buffer B = 95% CH3CN, 0.1% formic acid) at 5 μl/min. The column effluent was sprayed into an XCT ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent). MS/MS of the two major ions in each scan was performed automatically to identify peptides. The data were analyzed using data analysis software (Agilent) combined with the on-line Mascot and Global Protein Machine data base-searching programs. The activity of the enzymes was confirmed using the assays described below. The enzymes were quantified by Coomassie Blue staining on a 10% SDS gel and comparison of the density of bands with those of bovine serum albumin standards using NIH Image program. Fringe Assays—Fringe assays were carried out essentially as described previously (4Moloney D.J. Panin V.M. Johnston S.H. Chen J. Shao L. Wilson R. Wang Y. Stanley P. Irvine K.D. Haltiwanger R.S. Vogt T.F. Nature. 2000; 406: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Briefly, reactions were carried out in a volume of 50 μl containing 10 mm MnCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 6.8), 0.5 μCi UDP-[3H]GlcNAc as the donor substrate and 10 mm benzyl-α-O-fucose (generously provided by Dr. Khushi Matta, Roswell Park Cancer Institute) as the acceptor substrate. For UDP-GlcNAc saturation curves and activity curves employing EGF-26-O-fucose as the acceptor substrate, unlabeled UDP-GlcNAc was added to the reactions to bring the total concentration of UDP-GlcNAc to above Km. Reactions were carried out for 30 min at 37 °C unless otherwise indicated. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 900 μl of 30 mm EDTA (pH 8.0). Reaction mixtures were loaded onto C18 cartridges (100 mg, Agilent). The cartridges were washed with 8 ml of water and eluted in 1.5 ml of 80% methanol. The samples were then subject to liquid scintillation counting. For determination of optimal pH of Fringe reactions, 50 mm Tris acetate was used as the buffer in reactions and adjusted to the appropriate pH. Preparation of EGF Repeats—The first EGF repeat of factor IX, the factor IX double mutant, and EGF repeat 26 were produced in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) (the first EGF repeat from factor VII was a kind gift of Dr. Yang Wang (described in Ref. 22Wang Y. Lee G.F. Kelley R.F. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 837-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar)). Transformation and growth of E. coli BL21 (DE3) was carried out as previously described (23Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The bacteria were pelleted and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0) and sonicated 10 times for 20 s each on ice. The suspension was clarified by centrifugation and incubated with Ni-NTA-agarose for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. The slurry was poured into a 0.8 × 4-cm Bio-Rad disposable column, and the Ni-NTA-agarose was washed twice with 10 ml of 10 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). Protein was eluted from beads with eight 1-ml washes of 250 mm imidazole in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0). EGF repeats were further purified by reversed phase HPLC on a 250 × 4.6-mm Dynamax C18 column (Rainin) as previously described (23Shao L. Luo Y. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R. Glycobiology. 2002; 12: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Purified EGF repeats were then dried in a SpeedVac (Savant) to near dryness. In vitro O-fucosylation of EGF repeats was carried out by resuspending the EGF repeat in 1 ml of 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.4), 5 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm GDP-l-fucose (Sigma). Purified human His6-O-FucT-1 (∼40 microunits, purified as described for Fringe above) (24Luo Y. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) was added to the reaction mixture, and the reaction was allowed to proceed overnight at 37 °C. The O-fucosylated EGF repeat was then purified by reversed phase HPLC as described above using a 90-min 0-80% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. To confirm fucosylation of the EGF repeats, samples of HPLC fractions containing the EGF repeats were dried in the SpeedVac (Savant) and resuspended in 20% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. The resuspended sample was centrifuged to pellet insoluble material and directly infused into the XCT ion trap mass spectrometer (Agilent) at a rate of 5 μl/min. The MS peaks for MS/MS were chosen manually, and the data were analyzed using Agilent data analysis software. To quantify the amount of the fucosylated EGF repeat, carbohydrate compositional analysis was performed (25Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 26Sturla L. Rampal R. Haltiwanger R.S. Fruscione F. Etzioni A. Tonetti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26727-26733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample of each O-fucosylated EGF repeat was hydrolyzed in 2 m trifluoroacetic acid for 2 h at 100 °C. The samples were dried in a SpeedVac (Savant) and resuspended in water. The samples were then analyzed by high pH anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) on a Dionex DX300 using a PA-1 column. The amount of fucose was determined by comparing the signal from the hydrolyzed EGF repeats with that obtained by injecting known amounts of L-fucose. Other Methods—Analysis of the Rfng product was performed essentially as described previously (2Moloney D.J. Shair L. Lu F.M. Xia J. Locke R. Matta K.L. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol.

Specificity of Fringe for Individual EGF Repeats Is Encoded by Distinct Amino Acids of EGF Repeats—Many of the EGF repeats of Notch1 contain O-fucose sites; however, not all are subsequently modified by Fringe (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Furthermore, previous studies have demonstrated that the specificity of Fringe for an EGF repeat is encoded by the amino acid sequence of a given EGF repeat. More specifically, the endogenous Fringes found in Lec1-CHO cells (Rfng and Lfng) have been shown to modify O-fucose on EGF repeat 26 (but not EGF repeat 24) of mouse Notch1 (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Another important example of Fringe specificity is provided by comparison of the O-fucose saccharides on human clotting factors VII and IX, both of which are modified with O-fucose on their first EGF repeat (27Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Even though both proteins are produced in the same cell, only the O-fucose on factor IX is elongated to a tetrasaccharide (27Harris R.J. Spellman M.W. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Because the elongation to tetrasaccharide requires action by a Fringe, this suggests that the O-fucose on factor IX is recognized by a Fringe, whereas that on factor VII is not. A comparison of the amino acid sequence of the first EGF repeat of factor IX and EGF repeat 26 of mouse Notch1 (both recognized by Fringe) versus those of the first EGF repeat of factor VII and EGF repeat 24 of mouse Notch1 (not recognized by Fringe) reveals differences in the amino acid sequence between the EGF repeats that are recognized by Fringe and those that are not (Fig. 1). Importantly, many of these differences represent non-conservative changes in amino acids (e.g. significant differences in size or charge of amino acid side chains; see highlighted residues in Fig. 1). These non-conservative amino acid differences may account for important structural differences in these EGF repeats and therefore differences in the ability of the EGF repeats to be recognized by the Fringe enzymes. Using factors VII and IX as model systems for analysis, the first EGF repeat of both proteins was cloned into a mammalian expression vector (pSecTag2) that contains an N-terminal Igκ signal sequence for protein secretion and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag for purification (Fig. 2A). The constructs were transiently transfected into Lec1-CHO cells (which express endogenous Lfng and Rfng (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 28Chen J. Moloney D.J. Stanley P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 13716-13721Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar)). After metabolic radiolabeling with [3H]fucose, the secreted proteins were purified from the medium by Ni2+ chromatography using previously described methods (6Shao L. Moloney D.J. Haltiwanger R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7775-7782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The O-fucose glycans were released from the purified protein by alkali-induced β elimination and characterized by gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2, B and C). This analysis revealed that essentially all of the O-fucose glycans recovered from factor VII EGF-1 were in the form of monosaccharide (Fig. 2B), whereas the majority of O-fucose glycans from factor IX were in the form of tetrasaccharide (indicating Fringe elongation, Fig. 2C). These results indicate that we can replicate what is observed on full-length factor VII (monosaccharide) and factor IX (tetrasaccharide) isolated from serum using the Lec1-CHO cell system. This result also adds further support to the concept that the information necessary for Fringe recognition is encoded within the EGF repeat itself. Site mutants were then made to interchange the non-conservative amino acids between the factor IX and factor VII EGF repeats (Fig. 1). Analysis of the point mutations introduced into factor IX (Fig. 2D) revealed that substitution of the glutamic acid for isoleucine at position 24 (E24I) and the proline at position 28 for leucine (P28L) each independently led to a reduction in the elongation of O-fucose, indicating that these residues are important for Fringe recognition. None of the other mutations had a major effect on tetrasaccharide formation on factor IX. When both the E24I and P28L mutations were simultaneously introduced into factor IX, there was significant reduction in tetrasaccharide and an increase in monosaccharide. This change in tetrasaccharide/monosaccharide ratio was greater than that observed for either mutation alone, indicating an additive effect of the mutations. In the case of factor VII (Fig. 2E), there was no change in the relative amounts of tetrasaccharide and monosaccharide observed in any of the factor VII site mutants. However, when glutamic acid and proline were introduced into positions 24 and 28 of factor VII, respectively, a slight increase in tetrasaccharide, and a slight decrease in monosaccharide, was observed. Thus, the glutamic acid at position 24 and the proline at position 28 of factor IX appear necessary but not sufficient for Fringe recognition of O-fucose on these EGF repeats. In Vitro Analysis of Lfng, Rfng, and Mfng Activity—The cell-based analysis of factor VII and factor IX elongation shown in Fig. 2 is constrained by the fact that several parameters (e.g. relative expression levels of the tra"

The catalytic domain of the AMPK-related protein kinases is located in the N terminus of their catalytic subunit. Some of the AMPK-related protein kinases, including MELK, have an ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain adjacent to the catalytic domain and a C-terminal kinase-associated 1 (KA1) domain. The function of the latter domains are poorly understood. UBA domains are known to bind (poly)ubiquitin and have been suggested to thereby prevent additional ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of the target protein (9Buchberger A.

Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7104-7115Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In some proteins, UBA domains appear to function as dimerization domains (13Bertolaet B.L. Clarke D.J. Wolff M. Watson M.H. Henze M. Divita G. Reed S.I. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Between the UBA and the KA1 domains, MELK contains a TP dipeptide-rich domain that is phosphorylated in mitotically arrested cells and mediates binding to the transcription and splicing factor NIPP1 (14Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Van Eynde A. Rider M.H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8642-8647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Preliminary evidence implicates MELK in various cellular processes. MELK binds tightly to the zinc finger-like protein ZPR9 and causes its nuclear accumulation (15Seong H.-A. Gil M. Kim K.-T. Ha H. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 597-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Seong H.-A. Kim K.-T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9655-9662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the nucleus, ZPR9 itself interacts with the transcription factor B-Myb, a regulator of cell proliferation and differentiation, and enhances its transcriptional activity. Another interactor of MELK is the transcription and splicing factor NIPP1, but the binding of NIPP1 requires the phosphorylation of MELK on a specific threonine in its TP dipeptide-rich domain (14Vulsteke V.

Because wild-type MELK, but not a NIPP1-binding mutant, is a potent inhibitor of pre-mRNA splicing in nuclear extracts and because the MELK-NIPP1 interaction is increased during mitosis, it has been proposed that MELK contributes to the ending of pre-mRNA splicing just before mitosis (14Vulsteke V.

A third protein ligand of MELK is Cdc25B, a protein-tyrosine phosphatase that triggers mitosis by the activation of protein kinase Cdk1. Davezac et al. (17Davezac N. Baldin V. Blot J. Ducommun B. Tassan J.-P. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7630-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that the ectopic expression of MELK induces an accumulation of cells in G2 and that this effect was counteracted by the overexpression of Cdc25B. Intriguingly, MELK is expressed at high levels in both embryonic (18Heyer B.S. Warsowe J. Solter D. Knowles B.B. Ackerman S.L. Mol. Reprod.

Biol. 2003; 264: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), indicating that it may also play a role in stem cell functions of multipotency and self-renewal. Finally, MELK possibly contributes to oncogenesis because its expression is increased in tumor-derived progenitor cells (22Hemmati H.D. Nakano I. Lazareff J.A. Masterman-Smith M. Geschwind D.H.

Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7630-7641Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) are also MELK substrates, but the significance of their phosphorylation is not clear. A major limitation in studying the role of MELK as a protein kinase is that it is not known what controls its activity and that MELK expressed in mammalian cells seems to be inactive (5Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). This has prompted us to examine what determines the activity and substrate specificity of MELK, expressed in either bacteria or mammalian cells. We show here that MELK has a rather broad substrate specificity and that its activity is complexly regulated by autophosphorylation, autoinhibition, Ca2+ ions, and reducing agents. Materials—Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies were obtained from Stratagene. Anti-phosphothreonine antibodies were obtained from Zymogen, and anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Reduced and oxidized glutathione and PHOS-Select™ gel were purchased from Sigma. 45CaCl2 (2.2 mCi/ml, 134 μg of Ca2+/ml) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Preparation of Recombinant MELK (Mutants)—Wild-type MELK and the indicated MELK mutants and fragments were cloned in the pET16b vector, in-frame with the polyhistidine tag. The His-tagged proteins were purified on Ni2+-Sepharose™6 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The constructs encoding FLAG-tagged MELK (fragments) have been described previously (14Vulsteke V.

Point mutations were made according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol of Stratagene, using the appropriate primers and templates. The sequences of the DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Cell Cultures and Immunoprecipitations—COS-1 and HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum. 48 h after transfection, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 50 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.5 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm benzamidine, and 5 μm leupeptin. After sonication, the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation (10 min at 10,000 × g), and the supernatants were used for immunoprecipitations. The cleared cell lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG antibodies coupled to protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h at 10 °C. After one wash with Tris-buffered saline supplemented with 0.2 m LiCl and three washes with Tris-buffered saline plus 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, the beads were resuspended in 25 mm Tris at pH 7.5 and used for kinase assays and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibodies. Protein Kinase Assays—The kinase activities of MELK (mutants) and fragments were determined with the indicated substrates for 1 h at 30 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 mm magnesium acetate. Reactions with peptide substrates were stopped by transfer of the assay mixture to P81 papers and washing with 75 mm orthophosphoric acid. Reactions with myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrate were run on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Peptide Chip—The Trial PepChip kinase array (Pepscan Systems B.V.) contains 2 × 192 peptides, divided in 2 × 4 subarrays of 6 × 4 spots. The incubation was done as described in the manual. Briefly, the PepChip kinase slide was incubated for 2 h at 30°C in the following reaction mixture: 50 mm Hepes at pH 7.4, 20 mm MgCl2, 0.02 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.01% Brij-35, 20 mm DTT, 10 μm [γ-33P]ATP, and 0.5 μm MELK. After the incubation, the chip was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, washed twice with 2 m NaCl plus 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 and then rinsed twice with Milli Q water before drying. The dry PepChip kinase array was analyzed on a phosphorimaging device (Storm 640; Molecular Dynamics). 45Ca2+ Overlay and Ca2+ Buffer—The indicated amounts of MELK or NIPP1 were spotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Hybond-P; Amersham Biosciences), and the 45Ca2+ binding was carried out as described previously (24Sienaert I. Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. Sipma H. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25899-25906Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The free Ca2+ concentration in bath solutions was calculated with the CaBuf program (Droogmans G., KULeuven), taking into consideration the values of pH, temperature, ionic strength, association constants, and Mg2+ concentration. Mapping of Autophosphorylation Sites of MELK—Phospho-amino acid analysis by thin-layer chromatography was done as described previously (25Beullens M. Van Eynde A. Bollen M. Stalmans W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13172-13177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MELK-(1-340) was incubated for 3 h at 30 °C in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris at pH 7.5, 0.1 mm [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 mm magnesium acetate to allow complete autophosphorylation. The autophosphorylation sites of 32P-labeled MELK-(1-340) were determined by phosphopeptide sequencing as well as by mass spectrometry. For this purpose, 32P-labeled MELK-(1-340) was first subjected to a reduction for 45 min at 60 °C with 10 mm DTT and then to an alkylation for 45 min at room temperature in the dark with 35 mm iodoacetamide. The remaining iodoacetamide was neutralized by an incubation with 15 mm DTT for 45 min at room temperature in the dark. Subsequently, the proteins were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the aceton-washed pellet was digested overnight with 5 μg/μl trypsin in 200 mm ammonium bicarbonate plus 0.1% RapiGest (Waters). The resulting peptides were separated on a μRPC C2/C18 SC2.1/10 column (SMART System; Amersham Biosciences), equilibrated in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and eluted with a linear gradient of 0-70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The radioactive fractions were either analyzed by a 492 Procise (Applied Biosystems) amino acid sequencer, operated in the pulsed liquid mode, or by electrospray mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer. The latter was equipped with a Protana nanospray source. Identification of the phosphopeptides and determination of the phosphorylation sites were performed using the neutral loss scan mode and the product ion scan mode, respectively. The autophosphorylation sites of full-length MELK-(1-651) were also determined by mass spectrometry, using a different protocol. Wild-type MELK was digested in-gel with trypsin (5 μg/ml) in ammonium bicarbonate plus 0.1% N-octyl-glucoside as described previously (5Lizcano J.M. Goransson O. Toth R. Deak M. Morrice N.A. Boudeau J. Hawley S.A. Udd L. Makela T.P. Hardie D.G. Alessi D.R. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Digests were diluted to 0.1 ml with PHOS-Select™ wash/bind buffer (0.25 m acetic acid, 30% acetonitrile) and supplemented with 30 μl of a 10% (v/v) PHOS-Select™ gel, equilibrated in the wash/bind buffer. After an incubation for 20 min, the beads were captured in an Eppendorf gel loader tip to form a mini-column. The beads were washed three times with 30 μl wash/bind buffer and eluted with two times 25 μlof0.4 m ammonium hydroxide. The eluate was dried under vacuum and resuspended in 5% formic acid for analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on an Applied Biosystems 4700 Proteomics Analyser using α-cyano-4-hydroxy cinnamic acid (5 mg/ml + 10 mm ammonium phosphate in 50% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) as matrix. Electrospray liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed on a Dionex Ultimate capillary high pressure liquid chromatography system coupled to an Applied Biosystems 4000 Q TRAP mass spectrometer. The peptides were separated on a PepMap C18 column equilibrated in 0.1% formic acid/water and developed with a discontinuous acetonitrile gradient at 350 μl/min.

EMBO J. 2004; 23: 833-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), bacterially expressed human MELK was spontaneously active and phosphorylated the AMARA peptide, a classical substrate of the subfamily of AMPK-related protein kinases (Fig. 1A). Another widely used substrate for these kinases, the SAMS peptide, was an even better in vitro substrate of MELK. Surprisingly, MELK also phosphorylated a broad range of structurally unrelated proteins, such as MBP, Histone H1, and the splicing factors CDC5L, NIPP1, and SAP155 (not shown). To obtain some insights into the substrate determinants of MELK, we screened a peptide chip for candidate substrates (Fig. 1B). The used chip contained two identical sets of 192 peptides that all comprise established in vivo phosphorylation sites. Numerous peptides on this chip were phosphorylated by MELK. The three best MELK substrates were peptides derived from casein, eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, and lamin B1. These peptides did not show any structural similarity and were also very different from the AMARA and SAMS peptides (Fig. 1C) and from the sequences surrounding the established MELK phosphorylation sites of ZPR9, CDC25B, and NIPP1 (not shown). Using phospho-epitope-specific antibodies, we have confirmed that Ser51 of full-length, recombinant eukaryotic initiation factor 2α is phosphorylated by MELK (not shown). Collectively, our data indicate that MELK has a rather broad substrate specificity in vitro. MELK Contains an Autoinhibitory Domain—The catalytic domain of MELK is located in its N terminus. The C-terminal 60% of MELK comprises consecutively a UBA domain, a TP dipeptide-rich domain, and a KA1 domain (Fig. 2A). To examine whether the latter domains affect the catalytic activity of MELK, we generated various MELK mutants (Fig. 2B). Deletion of the KA1 domain or the KA1 plus TP-rich domains increased the Kcat/Km ratio 2-4-fold, using either the SAMS peptide or MBP as substrates (Fig. 2C). However, the additional deletion of the UBA domain, as in MELK-(1-266), resulted in an inactive enzyme, indicating that the UBA domain is essential for the expression of catalytic activity. Consistent with this notion, we found that the deletion of the UBA domain from full-length MELK also resulted in an inactive kinase. Likewise, MELK was completely inactive following the fortuitous mutation of the three first residues (D283K/D284K/D285K) of the UBA domain. Our observation that the N-terminal half of MELK is more active than the full-length protein (Fig. 2) suggested that the C-terminal half of MELK functions as an autoinhibitory domain. Accordingly, we found that the catalytic activity of full-length MELK (not shown) or MELK-(1-340) was inhibited by the addition of MELK-(326-651) (Fig. 3A). With MBP as substrate, a nearly complete inhibition was obtained with 15 μm MELK-(326-651) (Fig. 3A). Using smaller MELK fragments, we could delineate an inhibitory fragment to residues 326-530, which largely corresponds to the TP-rich domain (Fig. 2A). MELK-(602-651), essentially comprising the KA1 domain, was not inhibitory. The latter finding was unexpected because the deletion of the KA1 domain increased the catalytic efficiency of MELK (Fig. 2C). Lineweaver-Burk plots showed that the inhibition of MELK-(1-340) by MELK-(326-601) was largely accounted for by a decreased Vmax (Fig. 3B), consistent with the increased Kcat for MELK-(1-340) as compared with the Kcat of wild-type MELK (Fig. 2C). The inhibition of MELK-(1-340) by MELK-(326-651), MELK-(326-601), and MELK-(326-530) was also detected when the SAMS peptide was used as substrate, but the maximal extent of inhibition was less pronounced with this substrate and amounted to only about 65% (not shown). Autophosphorylation of MELK—Using immunoblotting with phospho-epitope-specific antibodies and phospho-amino acid analysis by thin-layer chromatography, we found that bacterially expressed MELK was phosphorylated on serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues and that the level of phosphorylation was further augmented by incubation of the purified enzyme with MgATP (not shown). The phosphorylation on Ser and Thr could be reversed by incubation with the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase-1, whereas the phosphorylation on tyrosine was reversed by incubation with a protein-tyrosine phosphatase from Yersinia enterocolitica (not shown). The phosphorylation of MELK is likely to be an autocatalytic process because the inactive variant MELK-D150A (14Vulsteke V. Beullens M. Boudrez A. Keppens S. Van Eynde A. Rider M.H. Stalmans W. Bollen M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8642-8647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is mutated in the essential DFG triplet of kinase subdomain VII, was not phosphorylated at all. We have initially used mass spectrometry to map the autophosphorylation sites of bacterially expressed wild-type MELK and MELK-(1-340). This resulted in the identification of 14 autophosphorylation sites, distributed all over the polypeptide chain, with the exclusion of the UBA and KA1 domains (TABLE ONE). Surprisingly, two independent mass spectrometric analyses did not identify tyrosine-phosphorylated peptides, which was in contrast with the data of immunoblot analysis. Because MELK contains a tyrosine in its catalytic loop (Tyr163) that is not conserved in the catalytic loop of the other members of the subfamily of AMPK-activated protein kinases (Fig. 4A) and because MELK is also the only member of this subfamily that is known to be autophosphorylated on tyrosine, we have examined whether it is perhaps Tyr163 that is autophosphorylated by MELK. In accordance with this view, we found that the autophosphorylation on tyrosine was largely lost in MELK-Y163F, despite the fact that this mutant was still catalytically active toward an exogenous substrate (Fig. 4B). We have also used N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation to map autophosphorylation sites in the catalytic loop. A tryptic peptide that was derived from 32P-labeled MELK-(1-340), was phosphorylated on both Thr167 and Ser171 (not shown). The latter site was not identified by mass spectrometry, possibly because Ser171 was phosphorylated substoichiometrically (see “Discussion”). In conclusion, the total number of autophosphorylation sites that we mapped amounted to 16 (Fig. 4C).TABLE ONEMapping of autophosphorylation sites by mass spectrometryPhosphopeptideResiduesMassPhosphorylated residueIKpTEIEALK54–621123.6Thr56IKpTEIEALKNLR54–651508.4Thr56DYHLQpTCCGSLAYAAPELIQGK162–1832670.2Thr167GNKDYHLQpTCCGSLAYAAPELIQGK159–1832969.5Thr167RIpSMK251–255713.6Ser253KRIpSMK250–255841.6Ser253LSpSFSCGQASATPFTDIK334–3512043.9Ser336LSpSFSCGQApSATPFTDIK334–3512123.9Ser336, Ser343NNWpSLEDVTASDK352–3651644.7Ser355TpSQFTKYWpTESNGVESK390–4062150.9Ser391, Thr398YWpTESNGVESK396–4061378.6Thr398pSLTPALCR407–4141044.5Ser407pSAVKNEEYFMFPEPK431–4451894.9Ser431LMpTGVISPER492–5011181.6Thr494CRpSVELDLNQAHMEETPK503–5202284.0Ser505VFGpSLER526–532886.4Ser529GLDKVIpTVLTR533–5431293.7Thr539 Open table in a new tab MELK did not phosphorylate the SAMS peptide when the phosphorylatable residue (Ser79) was replaced by a tyrosine (not shown), indicating that MELK is not a true dual specificity protein kinase and can only phosphorylate tyrosine(s) autocatalytically. Also, the autophosphorylation rate of MELK was independent of its dilution (not shown), suggesting that the autophosphorylation represents an intramolecular rather than an intermolecular process. In further agreement with this view, we found that wild-type MELK neither phosphorylated the recombinant (inactive) catalytic domain of MELK nor a synthetic peptide (residues 159-173) comprising the catalytic loop of MELK and including the autophosphorylation sites Tyr163, Thr167, and Ser171 (not shown). We have subsequently explored the role of autophosphorylation of the catalytic domain of MELK by site-directed mutagenesis (Fig. 5). MELK-(1-340)-T167A was inactive, strongly suggesting that autophosphorylation on this site is essential for activity. However, MELK-(1-340)-T167D was active, indicating that this replacement mimicked the phosphorylation of Thr167. Interestingly, both MELK-(1-340)-S171A and MELK-(1-340)-S171D were inactive, suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser171 is essential for activity but is not mimicked by an acidic residue. Mutation of Thr56 or Ser253 into either an aspartic acid or an alanine did not measurably affect the activity of MELK-(1-340). Mutation of Tyr163 into either a phenylalanine or an aspartic acid residue also had no effect on the activity of MELK-(1-340). The Expression of MELK Activity Requires Reducing Agents—The ability of MELK to autophosphorylate and to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate was completely dependent on the presence of reducing agents (Fig. 6A). A maximal stimulation of the protein kinase activity was obtained with 5-10 mm DTT. GSH was a less potent activator than was DTT, and GSSG did not activate MELK at all. The requirement for reducing agents suggested that MELK is inactivated by the covalent modification of one or several cysteines. The involved cysteine(s) are at least partially located in the catalytic and/or UBA domains because MELK-(1-340) was also fully DTT-dependent (Fig. 6B). Accordingly, the combined mutation of all nine cysteines yielded a MELK-(1-340) variant that no longer required reducing agents to be active (Fig. 6B). However, MELK remained DTT-dependent following the separate mutation (C29V, C70V, C89A, C154A, C168A, C169A, C204A, C286A, or C339A) of each of the nine cysteines that are present in the catalytic and UBA domains (not shown), indicating that MELK-(1-340) contains at least two cysteines that can be modified and thereby cause a complete inactivation of the kinase. Gel filtration chromatography revealed that MELK is a monomer, both in the absence and presence of DTT, indicating that its activation by reducing agents is not the result of the disruption of one or more interchain disulfide bonds (not illustrated). MELK Is Inhibited by the Binding of Ca2+—Following the serendipitous observation that MELK was more active in the presence of the Ca2+ chelator EGTA, we have explored whether the activity of MELK is perhaps controlled by Ca2+. Using a Ca2+-EGTA buffer to generate various concentrations of free Ca2+, we found that the kinase activities of MELK-(1-651) and MELK-(1-340) were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by Ca2+. Using MBP as substrate, we det"

Sterile α motif-containing RNA-binding proteins constitute a novel family of post-transcriptional regulators that recognize a specific RNA sequence motif known as Smaug recognition element (SRE). The Drosophila member of this family, dSmaug, triggers the translational repression and deadenylation of maternal mRNAs by independent mechanisms, and the yeast homologue Vts1 stimulates degradation of SRE-containing messengers. Two homologous genes are present in the mammalian genome. Here we showed that hSmaug 1, encoded in human chromosome 14, represses the translation of reporter transcripts carrying SRE motifs. When expressed in fibroblasts, hSmaug 1 forms cytoplasmic granules that contain polyadenylated mRNA and the RNA-binding proteins Staufen, TIAR, TIA-1, and HuR. Smaug 1 foci are distinct from degradation foci. The murine protein mSmaug 1 is expressed in the central nervous system and is abundant in post-synaptic densities, a subcellular region where translation is tightly regulated by synaptic stimulation.

Drosophila Smaug is involved in translational repression of the maternal mRNA encoding nanos, a posterior determinant, and thus plays a role in defining embryo polarity. Smaug recruits Cup, an eIF4E-binding protein that prevents the association of eIF4E with eIF4G, thus blocking initiation of the translation of SRE-containing messengers (6Nelson M.R. Leidal A.M. Smibert C.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 150-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been reported recently that Drosophila Smaug mediates degradation of maternal Hsp83 mRNAs by an independent mechanism that involves the CCR4 deadenylase and does not require Cup nor SRE motifs (7Semotok J.L.

The predicted coding region of hSmaug 1 from the AK034323 EST was subcloned between HindIII and SacII sites in the pECFP-N1 vector (Clontech) and KpnI and XhoI sites in the pcDNA6.0 vector (Invitrogen).

Primary Antibody against Mammalian Smaug 1—Rabbit polyclonal antisera were raised against the hSmaug 1 SAM domain, which was prepared as similarly described for the Drosophila SAM domain (21Green J.B.

Briefly, XL1-Blue cells were transformed with a pET22b expression vector (Novagen, San Diego) encoding the hSmaug 1-(306-371) fragment. Bacteria were induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 12-16 h at 18 °C. After cell harvesting by centrifugation, recombinant protein was purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Germantown, MD), recovered by elution in 300 mm imidazole, and then dialyzed against PBS. Animals were bled after two boosters. Translation and Real Time PCR Assays—The following three plasmids were cotransfected into BHK-21 cells plated in 60-mm dishes (106 cells per dish) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) without serum and antibiotics: 1) 20-500 ng of pCDNA3.0 vector carrying the firefly-luciferase coding region fused to a SRE tandem repeat, either wild type or mutated (2Aviv T. Lin Z. Lau S. Rendl L.M. Sicheri F. Smibert C.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar); 2) 10 μg of pECFP-hSmaug 1 or 6.7 μg of pECFP vector (Clontech); and 3) 50 ng of pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison WI) encoding Renilla luciferase. Twenty four hours after transfection, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantified using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Cell lysis was performed as indicated by the manufacturers, and measurements were both taken immediately and after freeze-thawing, with no significant variations. Transfections were performed in triplicate, and results were expressed as the average ratio of firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. Real time RT-PCR using SYBR Green (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was performed in triplicates of 1:10 serial dilutions of RNA using the following primers: 5′-tcgcggttgttacttgactg-3′ and 5′-cgatcttgttacaacacccc-3′ for firefly and 5′-ggaaacggatgataactggtcc-3′ and 5′-aggccgcgttaccatgta-3′ for Renilla luciferase. Following Equation 2 in Ref. 22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar, cycle threshold (CT) versus log [RNA dilution] was plotted. Only dilutions where plot slopes (= 1 + E (where E is the efficiency of target amplification), according to Ref. 22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar, were close to 2 and similar for the two templates (difference lower than 5%) were considered, indicating similar amplification efficiencies (22Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). A linear regression was applied to calculate the ΔCT (firefly minus Renilla) and the corresponding S.D. The ratio of firefly luciferase mRNA to Renilla luciferase mRNA was calculated as (1 + E)ΔCT, where (1 + E) was calculated from the slope, and the standard deviation was calculated by error propagation. Cell Transfection, Drug Treatment, and Immunofluorescence—HeLa, BHK-21, and COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Natocor, Córdoba, Argentina), penicillin, and streptomycin (Sigma). Plasmid transfection was performed in subconfluent cells plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Cells were harvested or processed for immunofluorescence 8-16 h after transfection. Fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C, 4% sucrose in PBS was performed with or without prior extraction of living cells in CSK buffer (CSKB: 25 mm KCl, 1 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2) containing 0.25 m sucrose and Triton X-100 0.1% for 1 min. After fixation, cells were permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS and blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were diluted as follows: anti-mammalian Smaug 1, 1:500 to 1:1000, and RLS1, 1:500; anti-PABP rabbit polyclonal antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Evita Mohr, University of Hamburg, Germany), 1:500; anti-TIA-1 goat polyclonal antibody 1:100 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal antibodies and suppliers are as follows: anti-TIAR, SMN (BD Biosciences); anti-HuR and anti-GW182 (Cytostore, Calgary, Alberta, Canada), anti-hPABP (ImmuQuest, Cleveland; UK), 1:100, and anti-V5 (Invitrogen), 1:500. Secondary antibodies were from Molecular Probes or Jackson ImmunoResearch (West Grove, PA). Cells were mounted in Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem, EMD Biosciences, Inc). Images were acquired using an LSM-5 PASCAL confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Proper equipment adjustment was ensured using 1-μm FocalCheck fluorescent microspheres (Molecular Probes). Cycloheximide and puromycin (Sigma) were added to conditioned media from stock aqueous solutions. Treatment with 50 ng/ml leptomycin B (Sigma) was performed in conditioned media for 2 h. Biochemical Fractionation, Sedimentation Velocity Centrifugation, and Western Blotting—Brains from 6-week-old mice were homogenized in 0.8 m sucrose, in CSKB containing the following protease inhibitors: 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride, pepstatin A, E-64, bestatin, leupeptin, and aprotinin (all from Sigma). Synaptoneurosomes, post-synaptic densities, and a membrane fraction were isolated as described previously (23Ma L. Huang Y.Z. Pitcher G.M. Valtschanoff J.G. Ma Y.H. Feng L.Y. Lu B. Xiong W.C. Salter M.W. Weinberg R.J. Mei L. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3164-3175Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For sedimentation velocity centrifugation, brain post-synaptic densities or post-nuclear extracts from cultured cells were prepared in CSKB containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.25 m sucrose. Samples of 0.5-1 mg of protein (determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein kit assay; Sigma) were loaded onto continuous 13-ml sucrose gradients (20-60, 15-45, or 10-30% w/v in CSKB) and centrifuged at 220,000 × g for either 2 or 4 h. When required, 1 unit of β-galactosidase was added as a 20 S marker. The polysomal profile was monitored by absorbance at 260 nm and β-galactosidase activity by colorimetric o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside reaction. Protein from 1-ml fractions was precipitated in chloroform/methanol (1:2) using 20 μg of lysozyme as carrier and analyzed by Western blot. Briefly, protein was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The following primary antibodies were used: anti-mammalian Smaug 1, diluted 1:10,000 to 1:20,000; anti-Staufen 1 RLS1, 1:5000 (20Thomas M.G. Martinez Tosar L.J. Loschi M. Pasquini J.M. Correale J.

Cell. 2005; 16: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); rabbit anti-S6 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), 1:1000; and anti-Drosophila Smaug (generous gift from C. Smibert,), 1:10,000. Detection of peroxidase-conjugated anti-V5 antibody (Invitrogen) and peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Sigma) was performed by chemiluminescence using the LumiGlo system (Cell Signaling). Mammalian Smaug 1 Represses Translation of SRE-containing mRNAs—The two genes homologous to Drosophila Smaug present in mammalian genomes were named as Smaug 1, located in human and mouse chromosome 14, and Smaug 2, located in human chromosome 19 and mouse chromosome 7 (Fig. 1A). We performed a screening of mouse brain, liver, testis, and whole embryo libraries and found two mSmaug 1 transcripts. The most frequent of them corresponds to a previously reported EST (GenBank™ accession number AK034323), and the second most frequent corresponds to a novel late embryonic 5′-untranslated region splicing variant (Fig. 1B). No splicing variants involving the coding region were found in our screening nor in the available data bases, including human and mouse sequences. We confirmed the presence of mSmaug 1 transcripts in brain, kidney, heart, and liver by RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 1C). We sought to investigate the effect of mammalian Smaug 1 on translation and stability of SRE-containing messengers. Although the direct interaction of hSmaug 1 with SRE-containing messengers was not addressed in this study nor in previous reports, it has been shown previously that SAM domains of vertebrate Smaug homologues specifically recognize SREs (2Aviv T.

BHK cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding an enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) or a hSmaug 1-ECFP chimera together with firefly luciferase-translational reporters bearing either wild type or mutated SREs in a trimeric tandem array (3xSRE+ and 3xSRE-, respectively) (19Smibert C.A. Wilson J.E. Kerr K. Macdonald P.M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2600-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A plasmid encoding Renilla luciferase to normalize for transfection efficiency was cotransfected. We found that in the presence of hSmaug 1-ECFP the firefly luciferase activity yielded from 3xSRE+-containing transcripts was reduced to 43% relative to the ECFP control. In contrast, firefly luciferase activity yielded from 3xSRE-reporters was the same in the presence of hSmaug 1-ECFP or ECFP (Fig. 2A). When extracts of cells expressing firefly luciferase were preincubated with extracts of cells expressing hSmaug 1-ECFP, no effects on luciferase activity levels were observed (not shown), further indicating that luciferase reporters are not modulated at the protein level by hSmaug 1. Simultaneously, firefly and Renilla luciferase mRNA levels were determined by real time PCR. The abundance of the firefly reporters relative to the coexpressed control Renilla mRNA was not affected by the expression of hSmaug 1 (Fig. 2B). As expected, the translational repression was proportional to the relative amounts of hSmaug 1 (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that human Smaug 1 represses translation of SRE-containing messengers without affecting their stability. The possibility of an effect on mRNA decay or deadenylation by recruitment of the CCR4 deadenylase, as is the case of the Drosophila molecule (7Semotok J.L. Cooperstock R.L. Pinder B.D. Vari H.K.

Murine Smaug 1 Is Present in Brain Synaptoneurosomes and Forms Small Particles—An antibody raised in our laboratory against the native SAM domain of hSmaug 1 specifically recognized the human protein in Western blot assays of BHK cells expressing hSmaug 1-V5. Expression of endogenous Smaug 1 was not detected in BHK or other fibroblasts cell lines (Fig. 3A and data not shown). Next, we evaluated the expression of Smaug 1 in the brain, as translational regulation is frequent in neurons (11Steward O. Schuman E.M. Annu. Rev.

A protein band of ∼70 kDa was observed in blots of mouse and rat brain extracts, in accordance with the predicted molecular weight of mSmaug 1 (Fig. 3B). We then examined the distribution of mSmaug 1 in brain subcellular fractions. Murine Smaug 1 was enriched in synaptoneurosomes (Fig. 3C), and a further purification indicated that mSmaug 1 concentrates in post-synaptic densities, a fraction from synatoneurosomes almost membrane-free and enriched in cortical cytoskeleton and synapse-associated elements, such as localized mRNAs and polyribosomes and the marker protein PSD-95 (11Steward O. Schuman E.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 24: 299-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 13Ostroff L.E. Fiala J.C. Allwardt B. Harris K.M.

Neuron. 2001; 32: 683-696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In contrast, mSmaug 1 was not detected in the synatoneurosomes membrane fraction (Fig. 3C). It also seems to be absent from myelin, as an oligodendrocyte extract gave no signal (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that mSmaug 1 is localized in neuronal structures associated with dendritic synapses. Next, we investigated the interaction of mSmaug 1 with the synaptoneurosomal translational apparatus by sedimentation velocity analysis. After centrifugation through a sucrose gradient, mSmaug 1 migrated as a 20 S particle and appeared not to be associated with polyribosomes or with ribosomal subunits (Fig. 3D). As expected, the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen 1 was detected in polysomes and in a faster sedimenting fraction (Fig. 3D), as described previously (16Krichevsky A.M. Kosik K.S.

Smaug Forms Cytosolic Granules That Contain Polyadenylated RNA—To analyze further translational repression by mammalian Smaug 1, tagged hSmaug 1 molecules were transiently transfected in fibroblast cell lines, and their subcellular distribution was then analyzed by immunofluorescence and sedimentation velocity gradients. We found that a large proportion of Smaug 1 concentrated in cytoplasmic granules no larger than 0.5-2 μm (Fig. 4A). These granules were observed in COS-7, BHK, and HeLa cells transfected with two different human Smaug 1 chimeras, fused to ECFP or to the small tag His6-V5 (Fig. 4 and data not shown). Most cells (66-85%) showed the representative phenotype depicted in Fig. 4A, granule size, and number as being roughly proportional to expression levels (TABLE ONE). As expected, transfected ECFP presented no granules (data not shown). Human Smaug 1 granules were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and were also observed after Triton X-100 extraction of living cells (Fig. 4B), whereas the nonpunctate hSmaug 1 signal was no longer present (see also TABLE ONE). Treatment with the CRM1-inhibitory drug leptomycin B strikingly increased the otherwise minor nuclear hSmaug 1 staining (Fig. 4, B and C), suggesting that this protein is shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Smaug 1 foci were extremely infrequent in the nuclear compartment; the protein showed a homogeneous distribution throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 4C).TABLE ONEPresence of TIA-1, TIAR, and PABP in hSmaug 1 foci The frequency of hSmaug 1 foci and the presence of marker proteins in those foci were analyzed in independent transient-transfection experiments by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. Determinations were performed after 16 h of expression, unless indicated otherwise. N indicates number of transfected cells analyzed. Cells with more than four hSmaug1 granules larger than 0.5 μm were considered as containing foci. The percentage relative to total transfected cells is indicated. The percentage of cells showing colocalization with the different markers was relative to the number of granule-containing cells. Cells were scored as positive for colocalization when more than 60% of their hSmaug1 foci contained the analyzed marker. Cells positive for PABP colocalization always showed more than 95% of double-stained foci. No differences in colocalization frequency of the distinct markers were observed between high expressing and low expressing cells (not shown).

Moreover, the Drosophila protein colocalized with mammalian Smaug 1 when coexpressed (Fig. 4E), further suggesting a functional similarity between the fly and the mammalian homologues. We then performed a subcellular fractionation of BHK cells expressing hSmaug 1-V5. Transfected hSmaug 1 was quantitatively recovered in the cytosolic fraction. When post-nuclear extracts were analyzed by sedimentation velocity centrifugation, hSmaug 1 migrated close to the 20 S marker (Fig. 4F), similar to the synaptoneurosome-associated mSmaug 1 (Fig. 3D). We simultaneously analyzed the distribution of the Drosophila protein coexpressed in the same conditions. Most interestingly, fly Smaug also migrates as a small ribonucleoparticle or free protein (Fig. 4F). Finally, for comparison, a construct encoding Staufen 1-V5 was cotransfected with hSmaug 1-V5 and analyzed simultaneously. Similarly to the endogenous Staufen 1 (Fig. 3D), Staufen 1-V5 comigrated with polysomes (Fig. 4F), indicating that overexpression is not perturbing the subcellular distribution of the transfected proteins. Furthermore, the absence of the transfected dSmaug and hSmaug 1 in fast sedimentation fractions, together with the plasticity of hSmaug 1 foci (see below), indicate that Smaug foci were not aggregates of mis-folded proteins. Given that hSmaug 1 repressed the translation of SRE-containing transcripts (Fig. 2), we investigated the presence of messenger RNA in the hSmaug 1 foci. Detection of the general PA"
https://openalex.org/W2005308044,"The role of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in regulating intracellular Ca2+ signaling and mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy metabolism is widely recognized in many tissues. However, the ability of skeletal muscle mitochondria to sequester Ca2+ released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during the muscle contraction-relaxation cycle is still disputed. To assess the functional cross-talk of Ca2+ between SR and mitochondria, we examined the mutual relationship connecting cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ dynamics in permeabilized skeletal muscle fibers. Cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients were recorded with digital photometry and confocal microscopy using fura-2 and mag-rhod-2, respectively. In the presence of 0.5 mm slow Ca2+ buffer (EGTA (ethylene glycolbis(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid)), application of caffeine induced a synchronized increase in both cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+]. 5 mm fast Ca2+ buffer (BAPTA (1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid)) nearly eliminated caffeine-induced increases in [Ca2+]c but only partially decreased the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ transients. Confocal imaging revealed that in EGTA, almost all mitochondria picked up Ca2+ released from the SR by caffeine, whereas only about 70% of mitochondria did so in BAPTA. Taken together, these results indicated that a subpopulation of mitochondria is in close functional and presumably structural proximity to the SR, giving rise to subcellular microdomains in which Ca2+ has preferential access to the juxtaposed organelles.

Taken together, these results indicated that a subpopulation of mitochondria is in close functional and presumably structural proximity to the SR, giving rise to subcellular microdomains in which Ca2+ has preferential access to the juxtaposed organelles. Mitochondria are one of the major subcellular structures in mammalian skeletal muscle. The key role of these organelles in muscle physiology was always considered to be the energy production via generation of ATP. In addition to this well documented function, more evidence has recently accumulated regarding the importance of mitochondrial Ca2+ transport in the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis (e.g. Refs. 1Sembrowich W.L. Quintinskie J.J. Li G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1985; 59: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Madsen K. Ertbjerg P. Djurhuus M.S. Pedersen P.K. Am. J.

Some confirmation has also been obtained that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake plays an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ signals during the contraction-relaxation cycle in mammalian skeletal muscle (e.g. Ref. 6Bruton J. Tavi P. Aydin J. Westerblad H. Lannergren J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 551: 179-190Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar, but see Ref. 7Lannergren J. Westerblad H. Bruton J.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Up to now, the most compelling data for a mitochondrial participation in excitation-contraction coupling of skeletal muscle was presented by Rudolf et al. (8Rudolf R. Mongillo M. Magalhaes P.J. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The authors reported rapid increases in mitochondrial [Ca2+] during single twitches or tetanic stimulation of mouse skeletal muscle in vivo. The increases in [Ca2+]m were well synchronized with muscle contraction. These results are quite intriguing as the Kd for the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is believed to be too low and the kinetics of the uptake to be too slow to account for rapid mitochondrial Ca2+ transients during excitation-contraction coupling (for reviews, see e.g. Refs. 9Duchen M.R. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 529: 57-68Crossref Scopus (905) Google Scholar and 10Brini M. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 399-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The apparent contradiction can be resolved, however, if a tight structural connection exists between mitochondria and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) 3The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumEGTAethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidEDLextensor digitorum longusFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. 3The abbreviations used are: SRsarcoplasmic reticulumEGTAethylene glycol-bis-(2-aminoethylether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidBAPTA1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acidEDLextensor digitorum longusFCCPcarbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone. in skeletal muscle. The latter would favor the existence of highly localized microdomains of elevated [Ca2+] during the SR Ca2+ release, which include both SR Ca2+ release sites and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites (for a review, see Ref. 11Rizzuto R. Duchen M.R. Pozzan T. Sci. STKE. 2004; 2004: re1PubMed Google Scholar).Currently available morphological data, although revealing a close proximity of mitochondria to the SR in skeletal muscle (e.g. Ref. 12Ogata T. Yamasaki Y. Cell Tissue Res. 1985; 241: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), place the organelles on the side of the SR/t-tubule junctions opposite to that where SR Ca2+ release takes place. The latter makes it somewhat difficult to conceptualize the intimate functional link between SR Ca2+ release and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake during excitation-contraction coupling. The apparent discrepancies mentioned above underscore the need for additional functional and structural studies of the cross-talk between the two organelles. In the present study, we evaluated the functional proximity of the SR Ca2+ release sites and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites in fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles of rat by comparing caffeine-induced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in the presence of slow (EGTA) and fast (BAPTA) Ca2+ buffers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Skeletal Muscle Fibers and Solutions—Rats (Sprague-Dawley, 175–200 g) were killed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia induced by intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital (100–200 mg/kg of body weight). The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School approved the use and the method of euthanasia of animals in this study. The extensor digitorum longus (EDL) or soleus muscle was removed and pinned in a dissecting chamber. Small fiber segments were cut (as described in Refs. 13Garcia J. Schneider M.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1993; 463: 709-728Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar and 14Shirokova N. Garcia J. Pizarro G. Rios E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), transferred to an experimental chamber, and pushed down against the coverslip floor of the chamber. Segments were first loaded with 5 μm mag-rhod-2 AM for 20 min at room temperature and then washed, permeabilized with saponin (as in Ref. 4Isaeva E.V. Shirokova N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 453-462Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and immersed into one of the “internal solutions.” The total volume of solution in the chamber was ∼500 μl.“EGTA” internal solution contained (in mm): potassium l-glutamate (140), HEPES (10), EGTA (0.5), sodium phosphocreatine (5), Mg-ATP (5), and CaCl2 (0.155) for a nominal [Ca2+] of 150 nm and [Mg2+] of 380 μm. “BAPTA” solutions had 2 or 5 mm BAPTA instead of EGTA. Nominal [Ca2+] and [Mg2+] were also adjusted to 150 nm and 380 μm, respectively. Dissociation constants were taken from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Critically Selected Stability Constants of Metal Complexes Database 46 (U. S. Department of Commerce, Technology Administration, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD). Both solutions contained a low concentration of the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura-2 (2 μm; potassium salt) and 20 μm N-benzyl-p-toluene sulfonamide to minimize the contraction of fast-twitch EDL fibers. To reduce movement artifacts fibers were also stretched to about 3.5 mm sarcomere length. pH was adjusted to 7.0 with KOH, and osmolality was 300 mosmol/kg.Fluorescence Measurements—To study the mutual relationship between ligand-stimulated cytosolic and mitochondrial [Ca2+] transients, we modified the technique introduced by Duke and Steele (15Duke A.M. Steele D.S. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 104-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Throughout the experimental protocol, the permeabilized fiber preloaded with mag-rhod-2 was continuously perfused with internal solution containing fura-2 at a rate of ∼0.5 ml/min. Waste solution was collected at the outlet pool. Solutions containing 20 mm caffeine were rapidly applied (∼2 ml/min) for a duration of 3 s via a dedicated inlet pipette. Cytosolic Ca2+ transients were recorded as ratiometric fura-2 signals. At the same time, changes in mitochondrial [Ca2+] were estimated from the mag-rhod-2 signals. Mag-rhod-2 fluorescence decreased by about 50% after permeabilization, suggesting that most of the dye initially trapped in the cytoplasm was washed out. The rest of the dye was accumulated in mitochondria (as shown in Ref. 4Isaeva E.V. Shirokova N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2003; 547: 453-462Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar).Fluorescence measurements were carried out with a RatioMaster M-40 fluorescence photometer (Photon Technology International, Lawrenceville, NJ) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope (Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany) equipped with a quartz ×40, 1.25 NA, glycerol immersion objective (Partec GmbH, Münster, Germany). The fiber was illuminated with light of 340 or 380 nm (for fura-2) and 540 nm (for mag-rhod-2) at 1 ÷ 20 Hz. The fluorescence emission was detected through a rectangular pinhole placed in the center of the fiber. Cytosolic Ca2+ transients are presented as the excitation ratio (340:380 nm) of light intensities emitted above 500 nm. Mitochondrial transients are presented in arbitrary units as light intensities emitted above 570 nm.Imaging Local Changes in [Ca2+] within Individual Mitochondria—Mitochondria labeled with mag-rhod-2 (as described above) were imaged with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Radiance 2000; Bio-Rad) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 100 inverted microscope equipped with a ×63, 1.2 NA, water immersion lens (Zeiss Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Mag-rhod-2 was excited with the 543 nm line of a HeNe laser. The emitted light was collected above 570 nm.Chemicals and Statistics—Fura-2 was obtained from Biotium (Hayard, CA). Mag-rhod-2 was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals were from Sigma. Values are presented as means ± S.E., and n represents the number of analyzed cells or mitochondria. Student's t test was used for comparing paired observations. p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSCytosolic and Mitochondrial [Ca2+] Transients in 0.5 mm EGTA—Fig. 1A show cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients recorded at the same time from EDL muscle fiber at 1 Hz. In this series of experiments, fibers were constantly perfused with EGTA internal solution, and caffeine (20 mm) was briefly applied at 3-min intervals. Each caffeine application resulted in a transient increase in the fura-2 fluorescence ratio due to SR Ca2+ release (upper panel). Under our experimental conditions, each 3-s exposure to 20 mm caffeine produced a Ca2+ transient of maximal amplitude as more prolonged application of caffeine did not substantially increase the amplitude of the response. From in situ calibration experiments, we know that this was not due to saturation of fura-2 (R340/380 max = 4.68, R340/380 min = 0.74, Kd = 386 nm). Increasing the time interval between caffeine pulses also had no effect on the amplitude of caffeine-induced transients, suggesting that SR was completely reloaded with Ca2+ between the caffeine pulses. In this and 11 other EDL fibers, the amplitude of the cytosolic Ca2+ transients expressed in ΔR340/380 was 0.44 ± 0.05. In Fig. 1A, the bottom panel illustrates that the release of Ca2+ from the SR also resulted in a substantial increase in the mag-rhod-2 fluorescence. The averaged amplitude of the mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in units of ΔF540/F0 540 was 0.23 ± 0.02. To show that the signal measured with mag-rhod-2 indeed reflects changes in mitochondrial [Ca2+], the effect of the protonophore FCCP was examined. Since Ca2+ uptake into mitochondria is largely governed by an electrogenic Ca2+ uniporter, dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential should impair the ability of the organelles to sequester Ca2+ released from the SR by caffeine. As expected, the application of 2.5 μm FCCP significantly decreased the mag-rhod-2 fluorescence and nearly eliminated caffeine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in seven cells studied. At the same time, FCCP significantly increased the amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ signals in five out of seven cells (ΔR340/380 was 0.40 ± 0.06 and 0.48 ± 0.07, respectively, before and after the drug was added).Fig. 1B illustrates a similar set of experiments carried out on 12 permeabilized soleus muscle fibers. The application of caffeine produced substantial cytosolic (ΔR340/380 was 0.34 ± 0.03) and mitochondrial (ΔF540/F0 540 was 0.42 ± 0.07) Ca2+ transients. Similar to the experiments with EDL cells, 2.5 μm FCCP progressively eliminated caffeine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ transients, gradually reduced mitochondrial [Ca2+], and significantly increased the amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ transients (from 0.34 ± 0.05 to 0.50 ± 0.04, n = 4, in units of ΔR340/380).In Fig. 2, the left panels represent superimposed records of cytosolic (black lines) and mitochondrial (gray lines) Ca2+ signals recorded in EDL (panel A) and soleus (panel B) muscle cells at 20 Hz. The caffeine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ transients exhibited a relatively slow time course. The maximal increase in Δ[Ca2+]c was reached 4.1 and 4.9 s after the onset of the application of caffeine in EDL and soleus fibers, respectively. The Ca2+ transients then decreased to the resting value with a half-time (t1/2) of 3.2 and 5.8 s for EDL and soleus cells, respectively. Cytosolic transients were closely accompanied by the mitochondrial Ca2+ signals. The kinetics of mitochondrial transients was somewhat slower than that of cytosolic signals. The maximal increase in [Ca2+]m occurred 5.2 and 7.2 s after caffeine application, and t1/2 was 3.4 and 6.4 s in EDL and soleus fibers, correspondingly. However, mitochondrial [Ca2+] started to increase immediately after cytosolic [Ca2+] rose above the resting level. This is clearly seen in Fig. 2 (right panels), in which Δ[Ca2+]m versus Δ[Ca2+]c are plotted on an expanded time scale. The gray regression lines show a strong positive correlation between the transients at the initial phase of their development.FIGURE 2Temporal characteristics of caffeine-induced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+transients. Left panels show superimposed cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in EDL (A) and soleus (B) fibers, respectively. Right panels plot fura-2 ratio versus mag-rhod-2 fluorescence from the traces on the left. The curved counterclockwise arrow gives an approximation of the time course for each phase of the response. Although during the first 2.5 s both signals changed in a synchronized fashion (as indicated by the gray regression lines), the mitochondrial signal lagged behind the cytosolic Ca2+ transient during later phases of the signal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)On average, the maximal increase in Δ[Ca2+]c occurred 3.40 ± 0.23 s (n = 12) after the onset of the 3-s application of caffeine in EDL fibers and 5.05 ± 0.48 s (n = 12) after the onset in soleus cells. [Ca2+]c decreased to its resting value with a half-time of 3.78 ± 0.37 and 4.78 ± 0.42 s, in EDL and soleus cells, respectively. In the same set of experiments, the time to both the maximal increase in [Ca2+]m and the t1/2 were significantly longer (4.97 ± 0.28 and 6.84 ± 0.51 s; 4.93 ± 0.89 and 6.8 ± 0.82 s in EDL and soleus cells, respectively).Cytosolic and Mitochondrial [Ca2+] Transients in 2 and 5 mm BAPTA—To probe the functional proximity of Ca2+ release sites and mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake sites in fast- and slow-twitch skeletal muscles of rat, we repeated the same type of experiments as illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, in the presence of the fast Ca2+ buffer BAPTA. If the organelles are substantially separated in space such that mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake requires diffusion of Ca2+ released from the SR, then BAPTA would dramatically attenuate (or even eliminate) both caffeine-induced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients. However, if mitochondria and SR are in sufficiently close spatial proximity, this could result in the formation of microdomains of high [Ca2+] during SR Ca2+ release. Ca2+ could then reach the mitochondria by “tunneling” via these microdomains and could not be intercepted by BAPTA. As a consequence, BAPTA (at a suitable concentration) would only suppress the cytosolic Ca2+ signals but not eliminate mitochondrial Ca2+ transients.In our experiments, 2 mm BAPTA partially suppressed both cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals produced by the application of caffeine. Furthermore, 5 mm BAPTA nearly eliminated cytosolic but did not further substantially reduce mitochondrial transients. Fig. 3 shows representative caffeine-induced Δ[Ca2+]c and Δ[Ca2+]m signals recorded from EDL (A) and soleus (B) fibers incubated in 5 mm BAPTA solution. In both fibers, the cytosolic Ca2+ indicator fura-2 failed to detect substantial increases in [Ca2+]c following the application of caffeine, whereas mag-rhod-2 reported considerable Δ[Ca2+]m.FIGURE 3Caffeine-induced Δ[Ca2+]c andΔ[Ca2+]m in 5 mm BAPTA. A and B, cytosolic (top panels) and mitochondrial (bottom panels) Ca2+ transients simultaneously recorded in the presence 5 mm BAPTA in EDL (A) and soleus (B) fibers. Although the cytosolic Ca2+ signals were completely suppressed by the rapid Ca2+ buffer BAPTA, the mitochondrial transients remained clearly visible, suggesting preferential access or tunneling of SR Ca2+ into the mitochondria. The small deflections in the cytosolic traces during the application of caffeine result from small motion artifacts and/or from slight quenching of fura-2 signal by caffeine.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In 11 EDL cells bathed in 2 mm BAPTA, the average amplitude of cytosolic Ca2+ transients in ΔR340/380 units was 0.30 ± 0.04, which constitutes 68.2% of the value obtained in EGTA. A comparable decrease was also observed in mitochondrial Ca2+ transients with respect to control (EGTA). The averaged amplitude of Δ[Ca2+]m expressed in units of ΔF540/F0 540 was 0.14 ± 0.02, which is 60.9% of the control amplitude. In addition, whereas 2 mm BAPTA did not substantially change the kinetics of cytosolic Ca2+ transients (time to the peak was 3.81 ± 0.18 when compared with 3.40 ± 0.23 s in EGTA), it significantly sped up mitochondrial transients (time to the peak was 3.86 ± 0.16 when compared with 4.97 ± 0.28 s in EGTA).A similar observation was also made in 11 soleus fibers. The averaged amplitudes of Δ[Ca2+]c and Δ[Ca2+]m in 2 mm BAPTA were 0.20 ± 0.02 and 0.21 ± 0.03, respectively, which correspond to 58.8 and 52.5% of the control values obtained in EGTA. The kinetics of mitochondrial but not cytosolic transients was also significantly faster in 2 mm BAPTA (see Table 1 for details).TABLE 1Amplitudes and temporal characteristics of caffeine-induced cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in EDL and soleus fibersΔ[Ca2+]cΔ[Ca2+]mAmplitudeTime to the peakAmplitudeTime to the peakΔR340/380sΔF540/F0 540sEDL fibers 0.5 EGTA, n = 120.44 ± 0.053.40 ± 0.230.23 ± 0.024.97 ± 0.28 2 BAPTA, n = 110.30 ± 0.043.81 ± 0.180.14 ± 0.023.86 ± 0.16 5 BAPTA, n = 60.02 ± 0.001NA0.10 ± 0.013.81 ± 0.48Soleus fibers 0.5 EGTA, n = 120.34 ± 0.035.05 ± 0.480.42 ± 0.076.84 ± 0.51 2 BAPTA, n = 110.20 ± 0.025.40 ± 0.790.21 ± 0.035.45 ± 0.72 5 BAPTA, n = 6NANA0.15 ± 0.025.08 ± 0.74 Open table in a new tab When fibers were studied at a higher concentration of BAPTA (5 mm), quantitatively different results were obtained. In six EDL cells, 5 mm BAPTA nearly eliminated cytosolic Ca2+ transients (averaged ΔR 340/380 was 0.02 ± 0.001, or only 4.5% of the value obtained in EGTA). At the same time, the mitochondrial Ca2+ responses remained substantial (the averaged ΔF540/F0 540 was 0.10 ± 0.01, which is 43.5% of the control amplitude). A similar observation was also made in six soleus fibers. Although no caffeine-induced cytosolic Ca2+ signals could be detected in BAPTA, corresponding mitochondrial Ca2+ transients were still recorded. The averaged amplitude of Δ[Ca2+]m was 0.15 ± 0.02, or 37.5% of that measured in EGTA. It also turned out that in both fiber types, the kinetics of Δ[Ca2+]m in high BAPTA was not significantly different from the kinetics of Δ[Ca2+]c in EGTA (time to the peak was 3.81 ± 0.48 and 5.08 ± 0.74 s, for EDL and soleus cells, correspondingly).Local Changes in [Ca2+]m in EGTA—To establish whether all individual mitochondria in skeletal muscle pick up Ca2+ in the same way and whether they are all strategically positioned to do so in BAPTA, we employed confocal imaging and studied local changes in [Ca2+]m in response to caffeine applications. Fig. 4A shows an EDL skeletal muscle fiber, which has been loaded with mag-rhod-2, permeabilized, and immersed in EGTA solution. The subcellular organization of the organelles was very similar to that observed when tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester fluorescence or NADH autofluorescence was used to monitor mitochondrial membrane potential or mitochondrial redox state (4Isaeva E.V.

Panel B also represents pseudocolor images of raw fluorescence obtained from the same location within the fiber before, during, and after application of 20 mm caffeine. Averaged fluorescent signals emitted by mag-rhod-2 trapped inside identified mitochondria were determined at every image of the series, normalized to the corresponding mag-rhod-2 fluorescence values before the application of caffeine, and plotted against time. The line plot on the bottom represents changes in mag-rhod-2-related fluorescence within a mitochondrion (or small groups of mitochondria) indicated by a circle. Δ[Ca2+]m reached its peak of 0.49 (in ΔF540/F0 540) 3.68 s after onset of caffeine application.In this and 21 other EDL fibers studied in EGTA, caffeine produced increases in almost all (454 out of 461) mitochondria identified on the images. Fig. 3, C and D, summarize amplitudes and spatial characteristics of local mitochondrial transients recorded in EGTA. Only transients with an amplitude of ΔF/F0 > 3 S.D. were analyzed. They varied substantially in their peak amplitude and temporal onsets. Similarly to those recorded from a whole cell, caffeine-induced mitochondrial transients were relatively slow (with a time to the peak after the onset of caffeine pulse corresponding to 4.32 ± 0.02 s) and reached maximal amplitude of 0.47 ± 0.01 (in ΔF540/F0 540).Local Changes in [Ca2+]m in 5 mm BAPTA—In this group of experiments, we studied localized mitochondrial Ca2+ transients in EDL fibers incubated in 5 mm BAPTA. Fiber segments were imaged with a fast confocal scanner. Mitochondria were identified on the images obtained before caffeine pulses were applied. Local Ca2+ transients in individual or small groups of mitochondria were analyzed in the same way as in the experiments with EGTA.Fig. 5A represents pseudocolor images of raw fluorescence obtained from the same location within a fiber before, during, and after caffeine was applied. On the left is a mask image of identified mitochondria. In this particular fiber, caffeine produced substantial (with an amplitude ΔF/F0 > 3 S.D.) Ca2+ transients in 6 out of 14 mitochondria.

Mitochondrial transients reached a maximal amplitude of 0.39 ± 0.01 (in ΔF540/F0 540) 4.20 ± 0.04 s after the onset of the caffeine pulse (Fig. 5, B and C).Local Changes in [Ca2+]m in EGTA and 5 mm BAPTA in the Same Population of Mitochondria—Mag-rhod-2 is a non ratiometric Ca2+ indicator. Its concentration inside different mitochondria may vary. The latter, in principle, could contribute to the heterogeneity of mitochondrial Ca2+ responses observed in our experiments. Although the analysis revealed no correlation between the amplitude of mitochondrial Ca2+ transients and resting mag-rhod-2 fluorescence, both in EGTA and in BAPTA (regression coefficients r2 were 0.004 and –0.001, respectively), we used an additional approach to clarify this issue. EDL cells were loaded with mag-rhod-2, and caffeine-induced mitochondrial Ca2+ transients from the same group of mitochondria were recorded first in EGTA and then in 5 mm BAPTA internal solutions. Fig. 6A represents images of fluorescence obtained from a fiber first in EGTA (left panel) and then in BAPTA (right panel) during the application of 20 mm caffeine. In EGTA, caffeine produced substantial Ca2+ transients in all 18 identified mitochondria. After the fiber was immersed in BAPTA, only 10 mitochondria remained capable of sequestering Ca2+.

Eukaryotic cells contain several cytosolic Hsp70 subfamilies. In yeast, these include the Hsp70s SSB and SSA as well as the Hsp110-like Sse1/2p. The cellular functions and interplay between these different Hsp70 systems remain ill-defined. Here we show that the different cytosolic Hsp70 systems functionally interact with Hsp110 to form a chaperone network that interacts with newly translated polypeptides during their biogenesis. Both SSB and SSA Hsp70s form stable complexes with the Hsp110 Sse1p. Pulse-chase analysis indicates that these Hsp70/Hsp110 teams, SSB/SSE and SSA/SSE, transiently associate with newly synthesized polypeptides with different kinetics. SSB Hsp70s bind cotranslationally to a large fraction of nascent chains, suggesting an early role in the stabilization of nascent chains. SSA Hsp70s bind mostly post-translationally to a more restricted subset of newly translated polypeptides, suggesting a downstream function in the folding pathway. Notably, loss of SSB dramatically enhances the cotranslational association of SSA with nascent chains, suggesting SSA can partially fulfill an SSB-like function. On the other hand, the absence of SSE1 enhances polypeptide binding to both SSB and SSA and impairs cell growth. It, thus, appears that Hsp110 is an important regulator of Hsp70-substrate interactions. Based on our data, we propose that Hsp110 cooperates with the SSB and SSA Hsp70 subfamilies, which act sequentially during de novo folding.

Hsp70s are a highly conserved family of proteins ubiquitously distributed in all cellular compartments of prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Most Hsp70s have a molecular mass of ∼70 kDa and consist of two functionally coupled domains, a 44-kDa N-terminal domain that mediates ATP binding and an 18-kDa C-terminal domain that binds the substrate polypeptide (for reviews, see Refs. 2Frydman J.

For instance, the cytosol of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains four functionally redundant Hsp70 homologues called Ssa1-4p, sharing more than 85% identity (herein SSA) and three ribosome-associated Hsp70s, Ssz1p, and the functionally redundant Ssb1p and Ssb2p, sharing more than 99% identity (herein SSB). In addition, yeast has two Hsp110-like homologues called Sse1/2p, sharing 76% identity (5Craig E. Ziegelhoffer T. Nelson J. Laloraya S. Halladay J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant.

On the other hand, in vitro experiments showed that the ribosome-bound SSB can be cross-linked to nascent chains in close proximity to the polypeptide exit channel (20Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N.

It has recently been suggested that SSB function at the ribosome is modulated by another Hsp70, Ssz1p, in a complex with the J-domain protein Zuo1p (21Gautschi M. Mun A. Ross S. Rospert S. Proc.

Cell. 2002; 13: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and have been implicated in thermotolerance (25Santos B.C. Chevaile A. Kojima R. Gullans S.R. Am. J.

Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and genetic studies also implicate Sse1p in Hsp90-dependent processes (24Goeckeler J.L. Stephens A. Lee P. Caplan A.J. Brodsky J.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 2760-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 28Liu X.D. Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Interestingly, biochemical studies suggest that Hsp110 chaperones may be involved in the regulation of Hsp70 ATP hydrolysis and that Hsp70 may have some stimulatory activity on Hsp110 ATPase as well (29Yamagishi N. Ishihara K. Hatayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41727-41733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 30Steel G.J. Fullerton D.M. Tyson J.R. Stirling C.J. Science. 2004; 303: 98-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). However, the ATPase activity of Sse1p appears to be dispensable for its function (31Shaner L. Trott A. Goeckeler J.L. Brodsky J.L. Morano K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21992-22001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To obtain insights into the function of the different cytosolic Hsp70s in de novo folding, we searched for cellular binding partners of the Hsp70s SSB and SSA and examined their interactions with nascent chains. We find that the major cytosolic Hsp70s, SSA and SSB, both associate independently with the cytosolic Hsp110 homologue Sse1p. To evaluate the interplay and relative contribution of each Hsp70 subfamily to de novo protein folding, we examined the flux of newly synthesized proteins through the different Hsp70 chaperones. Our data suggest that the SSB·Sse1p complex plays an early role in cotranslational nascent chain stabilization, whereas SSA·Sse1p acts mostly post-translationally to facilitate the folding of a more restricted protein subset. Analysis of Hsp70 interactions in Δsse1 cells further indicates that Hsp110 is an important regulator for both SSB- and SSA-substrate interactions. Our analysis indicates that a network of different cytosolic Hsp70s cooperates in de novo folding. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—SSA1, SSB2, and SSE1 were N-terminal HA-tagged (or 3HA-tagged for SSE1) and expressed in the copper-inducible vector pCu426 (noted as pCu) (32Labbe S. Thiele D.J. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 306: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Importantly, all the tagged chaperones fully rescued the corresponding null strain (not shown). A chromosomal copy of SSE1 was also 3HA-tagged at the C terminus via the integration of a kanamycin cassette (33Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4193) Google Scholar). Except where indicated, the Hsp70s were expressed in the absence of copper. Expression resulting from leakiness of the promoter closely approached physiological expression levels, as determined by immunoblot analysis with the corresponding antibodies (data not shown). In Fig. 2B, overexpression was achieved by the addition of 200 μm CuSO4. All experiments were done in the BY4743 background (MAT a/α his3Δ1/his3Δ1 leu2Δ0/leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0/LYS2 MET15/met15Δ0 ura3Δ0/ura3Δ0) with log-phase cells. The double mutants Δsse1/2 and Δssb1/2 were generated by mating and sporulation of single deletion mutants (34Brachmann C.B. Davies A. Cost G.J. Caputo E. Li J. Hieter P. Boeke J.D. Yeast. 1998; 14: 115-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (2646) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration Analysis—Wild type cells with chromosomally tagged SSE1-3HA were grown in rich media, harvested in log phase, and lysed at 4 °C in buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) by bead-beating for 10 min. Clarified extracts (∼150 μg) were then separated by size exclusion chromatography in a Amersham Biosciences Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column equilibrated in buffer A. Fractions were collected at 0.5-ml intervals, and Sse1-3HAp was immunoprecipitated with antibodies against the HA tag. The total elution profile and the immunoprecipitates were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibodies against Ssa1/2p, Ssb1/2p, the ribosomal protein Rpl3p, and the HA tag. Chaperone Immunoprecipitations and Mass Spectrometry Analysis— All chaperone immunoprecipitations were done via an HA tag located at the N or C termini of the corresponding chaperone. Yeast lysates were prepared from log-phase cells as described above. Samples were supplemented with 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Inc. monoclonal antibody HA.11, 5 mg/ml) and then incubated on ice for 40 min. The immunoprecipitates were further clarified to remove protein aggregates before rotating with protein G-Sepharose for 30 min at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) plus 0.05% Tween and then 3 times with TBS plus 1% Tween, as described (35Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Samples were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and proteins were visualized by Coomassie Blue or silver staining. Coomassie-stained bands were excised and identified by mass spectrometry. Pulse-Chase Analysis—Cells expressing HA-tagged Hsp70s from the pCu426 vector were grown to log phase and starved for 30 min in complete synthetic medium without methionine. The cells were then labeled with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine for 2.5 min and then chased with 20 mm cold methionine. At the indicated time points cells were quickly chilled and harvested in 250 mm cold azide to deplete of ATP and 0.5 mg/ml cycloheximide to stop protein synthesis. Lysates prepared in buffer A were clarified, and Hsp70-substrate complexes were isolated by immunoprecipitation using HA-specific antibodies as described above. Nascent Chain-Chaperone Interactions—Wild type and Hsp70-deleted cells were grown and labeled with [35S]methionine for 1 min as described above. After lysis in buffer A, ribosome-nascent chain complexes were isolated by ultracentrifugation through a 25% sucrose cushion (25% sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 25 min at 200,000 × g. The ribosomal pellets were resuspended, and the Hsp70-bound polypeptides in the supernatant, sucrose cushion, and ribosomal fractions were immunoprecipitated via the HA tag as described. Quantitation of Hsp70-associated Newly Made Proteins—Hsp70-associated polypeptides were quantitated with ImageQuant software on a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences, Version 5.2) by measuring the radioactivity in each lane in gel exposures that were within the linear range of the instrument. All quantifications were normalized over the total amount of labeled proteins (i.e. the total radioactivity in the ribosomal fraction for Fig. 4 or total amount of labeled protein for Figs. 5 and 6). For pulse-chase samples, the label corresponding to newly synthesized Hsp70 and Hsp110 bands was subtracted from the total radioactivity in each lane. Immunoprecipitations were adjusted for equivalent protein amounts in each time point. To compare the effect of chaperone deletions on substrate binding to Hsp70s, the amount of Hsp70-bound nascent chains within paired experiments in wild type and mutant cells were expressed as a -fold difference over the Hsp70-bound nascent chains in wild type cells.FIGURE 5Newly synthesized proteins transit with different kinetics through the cytosolic Hsp70s SSB, SSA, and Sse1p. A, experimental design. Cells expressing HA-tagged chaperones were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine, chased with cold methionine for the indicated time points, and analyzed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Chaperone-substrate interactions at the indicated chase times were determined after immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies. Control immunoprecipitations were carried out with a nonimmune antibody. B-D, the flux of newly translated proteins through SSB (B), SSA (C), and Sse1p (D) was assessed in wild type cells. NI, nonimmune antibody. The total fraction (Tot, lane 8) represents 5% of the total labeled sample at 0 min of chase and highlights the reproducibility of 35S labeling between experiments.

Upon immunoprecipitation of Ssb2p, a very prominent associated protein of higher molecular weight was readily observable (Fig. 1A, lane 1). Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that the SSB-associated protein was the Hsp110 homologue Sse1p. In like fashion, immunoprecipitation of Sse1p revealed association with two different polypeptides of ∼70 kDa (Fig. 1B, lane 1). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that one of the bands corresponded to Ssb1/2p, and the other band contained the cytosolic Hsp70s Ssa1/2p. The relative amounts of SSB and SSA in the Sse1p immunoprecipitation were comparable, suggesting that both Hsp70s associate to a similar extent with Sse1p (Fig. 1B, lane 1; see also Fig. 1C, lane 2). The interaction between Sse1p and Ssa1/2p was also observed in Δssb1/2 cells, indicating that the complexes can form independently of each other (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Immunoprecipitation of SSA and analysis of its associated proteins confirmed that SSA interacts with Sse1p, but it indicated that only a small fraction of SSA is in a complex with Sse1p (Fig. 1C, lane 1; see Fig. 2). The association between these Hsp70s was unaffected by the presence or absence of Mg2+-ATP in the lysis buffer (not shown) and was independent of the levels of expression of either Hsp70, as was observed using either plasmid-borne or chromosomally encoded chaperones (e.g. compare Fig. 1, B (lane 1) and C (lane 2), for plasmid-borne or chromosomally tagged Sse1p, respectively). Of note, these immunoprecipitation experiments did not detect a direct interaction between SSA and SSB, suggesting that Sse1p forms two distinct complexes with SSA and SSB (Fig. 1, A and C). On the other hand, we did not observe the other Hsp110 homologue, Sse2p, in any of our immunoprecipitations. Experiments using tagged Sse2p indicated an association with SSA Hsp70s but failed to detect association with SSB (not shown). Because the stress-inducible Sse2p is expressed at much lower levels than Sse1p (13Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 36Gasch A.P. Spellman P.T. Kao C.M. Carmel-Harel O. Eisen M.B. Storz G. Botstein D. Brown P.O. Mol. Biol.

Nature. 2003; 425: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (3008) Google Scholar), it is possible that its function is less relevant than Sse1p under normal conditions. Alternatively, the two homologues may have distinct cellular functions whereby only Sse1p can associate with SSB Hsp70s. Notably, immunoprecipitation of HA-Ssa1p using antibodies against the epitope tag also isolated untagged Ssa1/2p, suggesting that this Hsp70 self-associates in vivo, as suggested by in vitro experiments using purified Hsp70 (38Benaroudj N. Batelier G. Triniolles F. Ladjimi M.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15282-15290Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Hsp110 Sse1p Forms Distinct Complexes with the Hsp70s SSA and SSB—We next examined the distribution of Hsp70-containing complexes in cell extracts using size exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2). Lysates obtained from wild type cells carrying a chromosomally integrated 3HA tag at the C terminus of SSE1 were fractionated on a Superdex S200 column, and the elution profiles of the Hsp70s SSA, SSB, and Sse1p were determined by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). As previously described for mammalian Hsp70 (39Hatayama T. Yasuda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 395-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), SSA associated with numerous cellular complexes and migrated very broadly in the separation, ranging in size from monomeric forms to high molecular weight complexes eluting in the void of the column (Fig. 2A). In contrast, SSB complexes were found primarily in two major peaks. One SSB complex of very high molecular weight eluted in the void together with the ribosomes (Fig. 2A) and probably corresponds to ribosome-bound SSB (20Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The other broad peak displayed a molecular mass range between 60 and 200 kDa and probably corresponds to monomeric SSB and soluble complexes containing SSB. This is consistent with previous observations that SSB partitions between ribosome-bound and ribosome-free forms (20Pfund C. Lopez-Hoyo N. Ziegelhoffer T. Schilke B.A. Lopez-Buesa P. Walter W.A. Wiedmann M. Craig E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The elution profile of Sse1p was more restricted than that of SSA or SSB (Fig. 2A). Very little Sse1p eluted at its expected monomeric molecular mass; instead, Sse1p was primarily found in a peak centered around a molecular mass of ∼180 kDa, with a minor shoulder at ∼210 kDa. Because the major Sse1p fraction corresponds in approximate size to a heterodimeric complex between Hsp110 and Hsp70 and the immunoprecipitation analysis suggests that most Sse1p is associated with either SSA or SSB (Fig. 1B), it appears that Sse1p is predominantly in complex with Hsp70. Additionally, a small fraction eluted together with the ribosomal peak. To further examine the Sse1p-containing complexes, we immunoprecipitated individual column fractions for the endogenously tagged Sse1-3HAp followed by immunoblot analysis of SSA and SSB (Fig. 2B). Sse1p and SSA associated in a major complex of ∼180 kDa. SSB also coimmunoprecipitated with Sse1p in defined complexes. One complex coeluted with the ribosomal fraction (lane 18), whereas the other complex peaked at ∼180 kDa, with an elution profile almost identical to that of Sse1p (Fig. 2A). A minor peak at ∼210 kDa, also observed in this analysis of Sse1p complexes with both Hsp70s, may correspond to Sse1p·Hsp70 complexes with either additional cofactors or substrates. The gel filtration analysis of these Hsp70s supports the idea that not all the SSA or SSB Hsp70s are in a complex with Sse1p, but most Sse1p forms complexes with either SSA or SSB. Because we did not detect a ternary SSA·SSE·SSB complex (Fig. 1), it is likely that SSA and SSB complexes with Sse1p are mutually exclusive. Genetic Interaction between Cytosolic Hsp70s—Given the high degree of homology between Sse1p and Sse2p (76% identity), the differences between their association with SSA and SSB prompted us to examine the genetic interactions between the two Hsp110 homologues (Fig. 3A). Deletion of SSE1, although viable, results in a very severe growth phenotype at all temperatures examined (Fig. 3A). In contrast, deletion of SSE2 has no detectable growth defect, even at 37 °C. The severity of phenotype of the doubly deleted Δsse1Δsse2 was comparable with that of the Δsse1 strain. Although these results are in agreement with previous observations (13Mukai H. Kuno T. Tanaka H. Hirata D. Miyakawa T. Tanaka C. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 132: 57-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), a similar analysis in a different strain background observed a less severe phenotype for the Δsse1 cells and a synthetic lethal effect for Δsse1Δsse2 (40Trott A. Shaner L. Morano K. Genetics. 2005; 170: 1009-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In any case, the genetic analysis demonstrates that SSE function plays a fundamental role in normal cell growth. Furthermore, in our genetic background, Sse1p is the major source of Hsp110 activity, in agreement with estimates that Sse1p is >10-fold more abund"

To examine substrate recognition, we expressed in bacteria and purified three A2 (VWF76-(1593–1668), VWF115-(1554–1668), VWFA2-(1473–1668)) and one A2-A3 (VWF115-A3-(1554–1874)) domain fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography analysis, the initial rates of VWF115 cleavage by ADAMTS13 at different substrate concentrations were determined, and from this the kinetic constants were derived (Km 1.61 μm; kcat 0.14 s–1), from which the specificity constant kcat/Km was calculated, 8.70 × 104 m–1 s–1. Similar values of the specificity constant were obtained for VWF76 and VWF115-A3. To identify residues important for recognition and proteolysis of VWF115, we introduced certain type 2A von Willebrand disease mutations by site-directed mutagenesis. Although most were cleaved normally, one (D1614G) was cleaved ∼8-fold slower. Mutagenesis of additional charged residues predicted to be in close proximity to Asp1614on the surface of the A2 domain (R1583A, D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, K1617A, E1638A, E1640A) revealed up to 13-fold reduction in kcat/Km for D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, and K1617A mutants. When introduced into the intact VWFA2 domain, proteolysis of the D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A mutants was also slowed, particularly in the presence of urea. Surface plasmon resonance demonstrated appreciable reduction in binding affinity between ADAMTS13 and VWF115 mutants (KD up to ∼1.3 μm), compared with VWF115 (KD 20 nm). These results demonstrate an important role for Asp1614 and surrounding charged residues in the binding and cleavage of the VWFA2 domain by ADAMTS13.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 395-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1109) Google Scholar). Following endothelial damage, plasma VWF binds to the exposed sub-endothelial collagen (2Roth G.J. Titani K. Hoyer L.W. Hickey M.J. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 8357-8361Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Once immobilized, the shear forces of the flowing blood induce a conformational transition that unravels the VWF molecule (3Siedlecki C.A. Lestini B.J. Kottke-Marchant K.K. Eppell S.J. Wilson D.L. Marchant R.E. Blood. 1996; 88: 2939-2950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This in turn exposes the binding sites for glycoprotein (Gp)Ibα, part of the GpIb-IX-V receptor on the surface of circulating platelets that confer platelet-tethering function (4Ruggeri Z.M. De Marco L. Gatti L. Bader R. Montgomery R.R. J. Clin. Investig. 1983; 72: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Once tethered, platelets become activated and subsequently present GpIIb/IIIa on their surface, which makes a tighter, more stable interaction with both VWF and fibrinogen. Activated platelets provide the phosphatidylserine-rich surface critical for the assembly of the procoagulant enzyme complexes that lead to the generation of thrombin (5Zwaal R.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 433-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). von Willebrand factor high pressure liquid chromatography von Willebrand disease glycoprotein surface plasmon resonance N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. von Willebrand factor high pressure liquid chromatography von Willebrand disease glycoprotein surface plasmon resonance N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. VWF is expressed by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (6Bajaj M.S. Kuppuswamy M.N. Manepalli A.N. Bajaj S.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 1047-1052Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is synthesized as 250-kDa monomers, which undergo intracellular processing-glycosylation, multimerization, and propeptide removal-that leads to formation of mature VWF multimers (7Haberichter S.L. Fahs S.A. Montgomery R.R. Blood. 2000; 96: 1808-1815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although much of endothelial VWF is constitutively secreted into the blood as multimers of varying size, a proportion is stored either within Weibel-Palade bodies in endothelial cells or within α-granules in platelets (8de Wit T.R. van Mourik J.A. Best Pract. Res. Clin. Haematol. 2001; 14: 241-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These stored pools, which can be released upon specific stimulation, contain predominantly hyper-reactive “ultra-large” VWF that can exceed 2 × 104 kDa. A wide range of VWF multimers (500–20,000 kDa) are found in normal plasma that differ only by the number of constituent VWF units. The largest VWF multimers unravel more readily in response to shear forces and contain more platelet binding sites. These species therefore confer the greatest hemostatic potential. The size of plasma VWF, and thus its platelet-tethering function, is regulated to prevent aberrant/spontaneous platelet-rich thrombus formation. VWF multimeric size is modulated by the plasma metalloproteinase ADAMTS13, which cleaves at a single site in the VWF A2 domain between Tyr1605 and Met1606 (9Furlan M. Robles R. Lammle B. Blood. 1996; 87: 4223-4234Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This proteolysis can only proceed once VWF has been unraveled, either by rheological forces or in vitro in the presence of denaturants, both of which induce the exposure of the A2 domain scissile bond (10Tsai H.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 4235-4244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Physiologically, this occurs upon VWF secretion from endothelial cells, limiting the thrombogenic potential of newly secreted ultra-large VWF by converting it into smaller multimeric forms (11Dong J.F. Moake J.L. Nolasco L. Bernardo A. Arceneaux W. Shrimpton C.N. Schade A.J. McIntire L.V. Fujikawa K. Lopez J.A. Blood. 2002; 100: 4033-4039Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). The nature of ADAMTS13 recognition of the A2 domain is poorly understood. In part, this is because of complex folding and interdependence of the A1-A2-A3 domains. This has been illustrated by proteolysis studies conducted with isolated domain fragments and certain VWF mutations that confer type 2A (group II) von Willebrand disease (VWD) (12Kokame K. Matsumoto M. Fujimura Y. Miyata T. Blood. 2004; 103: 607-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 13Nishio K. Anderson P.J. Zheng X.L. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The latter are proximate or within the A2 domain and manifest enhanced ADAMTS13-dependent VWF proteolysis. This is thought to be because of structural changes that lead to constitutive/enhanced exposure of the A2 domain cleavage site (15Tsai H.M. Sussman I.I. Ginsburg D. Lankhof H. Sixma J.J. Nagel R.L. Blood. 1997; 89: 1954-1962Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because of the uncertainty surrounding A2 domain recognition mechanisms by ADAMTS13, we have prepared both wild-type and variant A2 domain fragments that span the Tyr1605-Met1606 cleavage site. For the first time, the cleavage of these by ADAMTS13 has been evaluated kinetically under normal physiological ionic conditions. We show that critical residues in the vicinity of the cleavage site are required for optimum cleavage and form part of an ADAMTS13 docking site within the A2 domain. Expression and Purification of Recombinant ADAMTS13 and VWF Fragments—Recombinant human ADAMTS13 with a C-terminal Myc/His6 tag was expressed and purified as previously described (16Crawley J.T. Lam J.K. Rance J.B. Mollica L.R. O'Donnell J.S. Lane D.A. Blood. 2005; 105: 1085-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). For surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and kinetic analysis experiments, an additional gel filtration step, using a Sephadex 26/10 column (Amersham Biosciences), was employed to obtain higher purity ADAMTS13. The coding regions for different VWF A domain fragments (VWF76, Ser1593-Arg1668; VWF115, Glu1554-Arg1668; VWF115-A3, Glu1554-Glu1874; VWFA2, Met1473-Arg1668) were PCR amplified from the human VWF cDNA using Pfx high fidelity DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fragments were cloned into the bacterial expression vector pET100/D-TOPO (Invitrogen), which fuses a His6 and Xpress epitope tag to the N terminus of cloned sequences. As the VWF A3 domain contains two disulfide bonds, the adjacent paired cysteines at positions 1669 and 1670, at the start of the A3 domain, were mutated to alanine using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). This approach improved yields of VWF115-A3 and ensured that the conserved A domain disulfide bond between Cys1686-Cys1872 was correctly paired. Certain type 2A VWD mutations (R1597W, R1597Q, D1614G, I1628T, G1629R, E1638K) and specific charged residue substitutions (R1583A, D1587A, D1614A, E1615A, K1617A, E1638A, E1640A) were introduced into VWF115 and VWFA2 sequences using the QuikChange XL kit (Stratagene). All vectors were verified by sequencing. VWF76, VWF115, and VWFA2 constructs were expressed in Rosetta Escherichia coli cells (Novagen, Nottingham, UK). VWF115-A3 was expressed in Rosetta-Gami E. coli (Novagen), which allows cytoplasmic disulfide bond formation. Transformed bacteria were grown in 2× yeast tryptone cultures at 37 °C with shaking. Once in log-phase growth, recombinant protein expression was induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside for 16 h. Bacteria were harvested, and soluble (cytoplasmic) or insoluble (inclusion body) fractions were prepared using BugBuster reagent (Novagen). Recombinant His-tagged proteins were purified on an ÄKTA FPLC (Amersham Biosciences) using Ni2+-Hi-Trap-chelating columns (Amersham Biosciences). VWF76 was purified from the soluble fraction according to the manufacturer's instructions and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. VWF115-A3, VWF115, and VWFA2 inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 m urea/20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8)/50 mm imidazole and bound to the Ni2+-chelating column. Protein refolding was achieved using an 8–0 m urea linear gradient (1 ml/min for 40 min). Refolded, soluble material was eluted with 500 mm imidazole. Misfolded, precipitated protein was stripped from the column with 6 m guanidine/0.5 M EDTA. All recombinant proteins (eluted and stripped) were dialyzed into 20 mm Tris (pH 7.8) overnight at 4 °C. For VWFA2 and VWF115-A3, the stripped material was refolded by this process. Thereafter, soluble and insoluble protein fractions were separated by centrifugation. The purity of each recombinant protein was assessed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining and quantified using a BCA total protein assay kit (Perbio, Cramlington, UK). Cleavage of VWF Fragments by ADAMTS13—For time course reactions, recombinant ADAMTS13 (final reaction concentration 5–16.5 nm) was preincubated without substrate at 37 °C for 30 min in reaction buffer (final reaction concentrations 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8/150 mm NaCl/5 mm CaCl2). In preliminary experiments, VWF76, VWF115, VWFA2, or VWF115-A3 were added as final concentrations of 4–8 μm to start each reaction. For analyses of the intact A2 domain, reactions were performed in the presence and absence of 1 m urea. At different time points, 65-μl sub-samples were removed and stopped with EDTA. 15 μl were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (16.5% Tris-Tricine gel; Invitrogen) and Coomassie staining. The remaining 50 μl were analyzed by HPLC. Samples were loaded on a BioBasic C4 column (Thermo Electron, Runcorn, UK), and the full-length and cleaved peptides were eluted/resolved using a specific acetonitrile gradient (20–55% for VWF76, 25–45% for VWF115, 25–60% for VWFA2, 20–65% for VWF115-A3). Mass spectrometry or N-terminal sequencing (Alta Bioscience, Edgbaston, UK) was performed to identify the polypeptide in each eluted peak and establish the precise site of proteolysis. For the determination of the specificity constant, low substrate concentrations <Km were used (250–500 nm substrate/5.5 nm ADAMTS13). Unicorn analysis software was used to calculate the areas under the peaks of the full-length and cleaved fragments. The measure of the catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km, was determined using Enzfitter software by fitting the data to Equation 1 kcat/Km=-ln(1-[AP]/[APf])et(Eq. 1) where [AP] is the area under the cleavage product peak 1 curve at time t, [APf] is the area under cleavage product peak 1 curve after complete cleavage, e is ADAMTS13 concentration, t is time. For individual determination of the Km, Vmax, and kcat, the initial rate of proteolysis of VWF115 (after 5–10 min) was measured at varying substrate concentrations (100 nm-50 μm) as outlined above. Data were transformed into Michaelis-Menten and Lineweaver-Burk plots, and the catalytic constants were derived using Prism 4 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR, using a dual flowcell BIAcore X biosensor system (BIAcore, Eyeworth, UK), was employed for analysis of the interaction between ADAMTS13 and different VWF115 variants. Two different SPR approaches were used. In each case, the surface of a carboxymethylated dextran (CM5) sensor chip (BIAcore) was activated with 0.4 m 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide and 0.1 m N-hydroxysuccinimide, according to the manufacturer's instructions. First, ∼600 response units of wild-type or variant VWF115 was covalently immobilized by amine coupling to one flow cell. To control for nonspecific binding, 600 response units of human endothelial protein C receptor was immobilized onto the other flow cell. All free reactive surface groups on both flow cells were blocked using 1 m ethanolamine. Different concentrations (10–137 nm) of ADAMTS13 in HBS-P buffer (BIAcore) were injected over both flow cells at 30 μl/min, contact time 1–2 min. After each injection, any bound ADAMTS13 was stripped with 10 mm NaOH prior to subsequent injections. Data analysis was performed using the BIAevalutaion software 3.0 (BIAcore), which allowed determination of ka, kd, and KD values by fitting the derived sensograms to 1:1 Langmuir model. For the second approach, ∼8000 response units of ADAMTS13 or anti-endothelial protein C receptor antibody (control) were immobilized to respective flow cells of CM5 chips, as above. Various concentrations (80 nm-1 μm) of VWF115, or VWF115 variants, in HBS-P buffer (BIAcore) were injected over both flow cells at 30 μl/min. The chip surface was regenerated with 10 mm NaOH as before. Using this approach, data were analyzed using a heterogeneous ligand (parallel reaction) model. Modeling of VWF A2 Domain—The VWF A2 domain was computer modeled using its sequence homology to the VWF A3 domain and the coordinates for the crystal structure of this domain (Protein Data Bank code 1atz_A), according to the method outlined by Sutherland et al. (17Sutherland J.J. O'Brien L.A. Lillicrap D. Weaver D.F. J. Mol. Model (Online). 2004; 10: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Models were manipulated using Protein Explorer (www.molvis.sdsc.edu/protexpl/frntdoor.html). Purification of Recombinant VWF Fragments—Different human VWF A2 domain substrate fragments (Fig. 1A) were expressed in, and purified from, bacteria. VWF76 was purified from the soluble, cytoplasmic fraction by Ni2+-chelating column affinity chromatography (Fig. 1B). SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining demonstrated a purified product of 12.5 kDa. VWF115, VWFA2, and VWF115-A3 were purified from inclusion body preparations. Refolding of these proteins was achieved using an 8–0 m urea linear gradient during purification. This technique produced high yields of soluble VWF115 and VWFA2 of the correct predicted size (16.9 and 26.9 kDa, respectively) that were essentially pure (Fig. 1, C and D). VWF115-A3 was initially purified and refolded similarly. However, after elution a relatively low yield of soluble material was purified (Fig. 1E, lane 1). The precipitated protein was stripped from the column and refolded by dialysis, yielding higher amounts of soluble material (lane 2) than the on-column refolded preparation. The eluted material and the refolded/solubilized stripped fraction obtained after dialysis contained a product of 38.6 kDa (lanes 1NR and 2NR). The presence of the disulfide bond between Cys1686 and Cys1872 was confirmed by the band shift upon reduction of this material (lanes 1R and 2R). The insoluble material after dialysis contained VWF115-A3 polymers arising through intermolecular disulfide bond formation (lane 3) and was discarded. Proteolysis of VWF76, VWF115, and VWF115-A3—To first visualize the capability of ADAMTS13 to proteolyze each of the recombinant A2 domain fragment substrates, recombinant ADAMTS13 was incubated at 37 °C with either VWF76, VWF115, or VWF115-A3 in the presence of physiological concentrations of Ca2+ and NaCl. Sub-samples were stopped between 0 and 6 h and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining to give a qualitative assessment of each reaction (Fig. 2, A–C). In each case, only the full-length substrate band was visible at 0 h. Thereafter, the intensity of this band diminished and two smaller cleavage product bands appeared. In each case, these bands corresponded to the predicted molecular masses of fragments generated following cleavage at the Tyr1605–Met1606 bond. N-terminal sequencing was performed upon the smallest cleavage product and confirmed that proteolysis had occurred between the Tyr1605–Met1606 bond. Visually, VWF76, VWF115, and VWF115-A3 appeared to be proteolyzed by ADAMTS13 at similar rates. Parallel samples were also analyzed by HPLC. The resolution of the full-length substrate from the two cleavage fragments (peaks 1 and 2) arising from proteolysis (Fig. 2) of each different substrate allowed precise quantification of the extent of cleavage at each time point, confirming that the rates of proteolysis of VWF76, VWF115, and VWF115-A3 were, as indicated by the Coomassie staining, very similar (not shown). To confirm specific proteolysis by ADAMTS13 and to identify each peak, cleavage product fractions were collected and analyzed by mass spectrometry. For all substrates, peak 1 corresponded to the tagged N-terminal cleavage product up to Tyr1605. Peak 2 corresponded to the C-terminal fragment, in each case starting at Met1606. Type 2A VWD Mutations and ADAMTS13 Proteolysis—The scissile bond in VWF is predicted from a homology model (17Sutherland J.J. O'Brien L.A. Lillicrap D. Weaver D.F. J. Mol. Model (Online). 2004; 10: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to be located in the center of the folded A2 domain (Fig. 3A). Given that VWF is the only known substrate for ADAMTS13 and that it is proteolyzed at just a single site, we hypothesized that other A2 domain amino acids that flank this site dictate the specificity of ADAMTS13 for the 1605–1606 bond. As an initial step toward identifying A2 domain residues that influence VWF proteolysis, we individually introduced six type 2A VWD mutations (see www.sheffield.ac.uk/vwf/) into the VWF115 construct (Fig. 3A). By mutating VWF115, which unlike the intact A2 domain naturally adopts a conformation that is permissive to ADAMTS13 proteolysis, the influence of specific mutations upon substrate specificity (as opposed to effects upon overall A2 domain structure) could be assessed under physiological ionic conditions. HPLC analysis of the proteolysis of VWF115 and VWF115 type 2A mutants (R1597W, R1597Q, D1614G, I1628T, G1629R, and E1638K) demonstrated that most of these mutations (R1597W, R1597Q, I1628T, and G1629R) had little or no effect upon VWF115 proteolysis (Fig. 3B). However, the E1638K mutant was proteolyzed slightly slower than VWF115, and the D1614G mutant was cleaved ∼8 times slower (Fig. 3B). As Glu1638 and Asp1614 are charged residues that are predicted to be located in close proximity to each other on the surface of the VWF A2 domain homology model, we hypothesized that such residues might comprise part of an ADAMTS13 interaction site. Using this model, we subsequently identified additional acidic or basic amino acids predicted to lie on the surface of the A2 domain in the vicinity of Asp1614 and Glu1638 (Fig. 3C) and individually mutated each residue (Arg1583, Asp1587, Asp1614, Glu1615, Lys1617, Glu1638, Glu1640) in VWF115 to alanine (Fig. 3D). Kinetic Analysis of VWF76, VWF115, VWF115-A3, and VWF115 Charged Mutant Proteolysis—As a qualitative assessment of the relative ability of ADAMTS13 to proteolyze each of the charged residue mutants compared with the wild-type VWF76, VWF115, and VWF115-A3 substrates, we analyzed cleavage reactions by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 4A). From these gels, it seemed as if all of the mutants exhibited reduced rates of proteolysis. However, the concentrations of substrates needed to facilitate visualization by gel staining were high. To perform kinetic analysis of proteolysis for different substrates, it was necessary to monitor cleavage using substrate concentrations below the Km for the reaction. Consequently, we determined the individual kinetic constants (Km, kcat) of VWF115 by measuring the initial rates of proteolysis at different concentrations (100 nm-50 μm). For the ADAMTS13-dependent proteolysis of VWF115 (n = 4), we derived a kcat of 0.14 ± 0.06 s–1. The Km for this reaction was determined to be 1.61 ± 0.47 μm, from which a value for the specificity constant (catalytic efficiency, kcat/Km) of 8.70 × 104 m–1 s–1 could be derived. For separate determination of the catalytic efficiency of VWF115, repeated time course experiments were performed using low substrate concentrations (250–500 nm). Repeated time course experiments (n = 8) gave a mean value of 7.83 × 104 m–1 s–1 for kcat/Km (Table 1). Confirmation of the pseudo-first order conditions was obtained by deriving the same kcat/Km value for VWF115 proteolysis at both 250 and 500 nm. Determination of kcat/Km for VWF76 and VWF115-A3 gave values of 6.39 × 104 m–1 s–1 and 6.70 × 104 m–1 s–1, respectively (Table 1). These kinetic data confirmed that the VWFA3 domain does not significantly contribute to the rate of A2 domain proteolysis, despite containing an ADAMTS13 binding site (18Dong J.F. Moake J.L.

The rate of proteolysis of the R1583A mutant was not significantly different from that of VWF115, suggesting that this residue is not important for cleavage. Mutation of Glu1638 and Glu1640 induced a mild (2–3-fold) reduction in catalytic efficiency. The most affected (>12-fold reduction) single mutant was D1587A, the kcat/Km of which was 0.64 ± 0.10 × 104 m–1 s–1. The kcat/Km for K1617A, D1614A, and E1615A, which are predicted to lie on the same surface-exposed loop, were 1.90, 1.36, and 1.13 × 104 m–1 s–1, respectively. These results implied that this loop might play an important role in the cleavage reaction. Consequently, we generated a triple mutant DEK1614/5/7AAA) containing all 3 residues substituted for alanine. Whereas individually these mutations caused a 4–7-fold reduction in kcat/Km, in combination the catalytic efficiency was >13-fold less than wild-type VWF115, implying that the amino acids in this charged loop may act in synergy. Influence of D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A upon VWFA2 Proteolysis—To test whether the effects of the above mutations were maintained in a fully folded A2 domain, we introduced the most affected single charged mutants into the whole A2 domain. A variety of VWF A2 domain mutations appear to alter the conformation of the domain, such that the scissile bond is more readily exposed and thus more accessible for ADAMTS13 cleavage under normal physiological ionic conditions. Therefore, this approach also served to ascertain whether the most affected charged residue mutants (D1587A, D1614A, E1615A) induced gross structural changes. Despite using increased concentrations of ADAMTS13 (16.5 nm) in the absence of a denaturant, the intact wild-type A2 domain was proteolyzed very slowly, as visualized by gel staining (Fig. 5A), when compared with the A2 domain fragments VWF115, VWF76, and VWF115-A3. When samples containing 500 nm VWFA2 were analyzed by HPLC (Fig. 5C), it was clear that the cleavage reaction did not proceed toward completion (∼28% after 5 h), as previously reported (13Nishio K. Anderson P.J. Zheng X.L. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10578-10583Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The D1587A, D1614A, and E1615A VWFA2 mutants were proteolyzed either at a similar or slower rate (Fig. 5, A and C), suggesting that these mutations do not alter the A2 domain structure markedly. Under denaturing conditions (1 m urea), the wild-type VWFA2 was proteolyzed faster, although it still did not reach completion (∼50% after 5 h) (Fig. 5, B and D). Although all the mutants were cleaved at a higher rate under denaturing conditions, they were cleaved appreciably slower than VWFA2, corroborating the direct influence of these mutations upon VWF115 proteolysis. Confirmation of ADAMTS13 Binding Site Residues in VWFA2 Domain—We hypothesized that the most likely cause of the reduced catalytic efficiency of the affected VWF115 charged mutants was impaired binding to ADAMTS13. To measure the influence of each mutation upon the interaction of VWF115 with ADAMTS13, we performed SPR analysis. Monoclonal antibody-mediated orientation-specific coupling of either VWF115 or ADAMTS13 to the sensor chip was not possible due to the relatively fast off-rates of these molecules with the available antibodies to each ligand (not shown). Consequently, we covalently bound either VWF115 or ADAMTS13 to the sensor chip by amine coupling. With VWF115 bound to the chip and ADAMTS13 injected over the sensor, we monitored a concentration-dependent binding response indicative of a high affinity interaction (KD, 20 nm) for this interaction (Fig. 6, inset). Determination of both the association and dissociation rates for the ADAMTS13-VWF115 interaction (n = 3) demonstrated a slow off-rate (1.72 × 10–3 s–1), which would appear to be the"

ATF4 is a substrate of the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase that binds to βTrCP through phosphorylation on a DSGXXXS motif. We show here that ATF4 stability is also modulated by the histone acetyltransferase p300, which induces ATF4 stabilization by inhibiting its ubiquitination. Despite p300 acetylates ATF4, we found that p300-mediated ATF4 stabilization is independent of p300 catalytic activity, using either the inactive form of p300 or the acetylation mutant ATF4-K311R. ATF4 deleted of its p300 binding domain is no more stabilized by p300 nor recruited into nuclear speckles.

ATF4, a member of the ATF/CREB bZIP transcription factor family, plays a crucial role in response to stress, because multiple intracellular stress pathways (endoplasmic reticulum stress, amino acid deprivation, and exposure to oxidant or reactive metals) converge on a single event, phosphorylation of eIF2α, which leads both to a general inhibition of protein synthesis but also to the translational up-regulation of the mRNA encoding ATF4 (1Harding H.P.

Thus the targets of ATF4 are of paramount importance in a generalized stress response. In fact, higher eucaryotes have conserved through activation of ATF4 the same fundamental mechanism used by yeast through up-regulation of GCN4 in response to amino acid starvation (5Scheuner D.

In addition, ATF4 is important for cell proliferation and differentiation, because ATF4 knock-out mice display abnormal lens formation (6Tanaka T. Tsujimura T. Takeda K. Sugihara A. Maekawa A.

The consequences of acetylation on protein function vary from one protein to another depending on where within the protein the acetylation takes place. Acetylation has also been reported to modulate protein-protein interactions, to inhibit nuclear export (20Madison D.L. Yaciuk P. Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38755-38763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and to alter protein stability.We have shown that ATF4 degradation is mediated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase SCFβTrCP (21Lassot I.

Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) that we first identified as the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for the degradation of CD4 induced by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protein Vpu (22Margottin F.

For most of the βTrCP substrates identified up to now, including ATF4, serine phosphorylation of a DSGXX(X)S motif is required for interaction with βTrCP and subsequent degradation by the proteasome. Although phosphorylation of βTrCP substrates is a crucial step for the regulation of their stability, it is probably not the unique event that regulates their destruction.Here, we show that the HAT p300 is associated with ATF4 and interferes with its stability. p300 increased ATF4 stability, independently of its acetyltransferase activity and thus enhances ATF4 mediated transcription. Our results provide a new mechanism for the regulation of ATF4 stability and expression.MATERIALS AND METHODSPlasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—Vectors for FLAG-P/CAF, FLAG-p300, and FLAG-p300ΔHAT were kindly provided by Y.

HA-ATF4Δ1-85 was obtained by subcloning in pAS1B; GST proteins were obtained by subcloning in pGEX4T-3.1. ATF4 lysine mutants were obtained by PCR mutagenesis and FLAG-ATF4 by subcloning in pSG (Sigma).Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—24 h after transfection, cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA. When indicated, 50 μg/ml cycloheximide was added before lysis. For immunoprecipitations, cell lysates were pre-cleared with mouse, rabbit, or goat non-immune antibodies and protein A- or G-agarose for 90 min, and supernatants were incubated overnight with 5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), 5 μg/ml of mouse monoclonal anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science), or 5 μg/ml rabbit anti-ATF4 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and then incubated with proteins A/G-agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h. Immune complexes were eluted with Laemmli buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and revealed by Western blotting. Antibodies used for Western blotting were rabbit anti-ATF4 (C-20) or goat polyclonal anti-ATF4 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rat anti-HA-PER (3F10, Roche Applied Science), mouse anti-FLAG-PER (M2, Sigma), rabbit anti-p300 (C-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-Myc (9E10, Roche Applied Science), anti-actin (sc1616, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-α-tubulin (DM1A, Sigma).GST Pull-down Assays—GSTATF4 and ATF4 mutant fusion proteins were expressed in BL21 Escherichia coli and purified according to standard protocols. 293T cells transfected with 10 μg of FLAG-p300 vector were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100 (pH 8). Lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of purified GST proteins. The beads were then washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA 1% Triton X-100 (pH 8). Bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and revealed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG antibody.Small Interfering RNAs—RNA oligonucleotides (from Eurogentech) anti-p300 (forward: 5′-cagagcaguccuggauuagtt-3′; reverse 5′-cuaauccaggacugcucugtt-3′) and luciferase (25Bres V.

Twenty-four hours later, cells were co-transfected with siRNA and plasmid vectors using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), and then harvested after another 24 h.In Vivo ATF4 Acetylation Assay—293T cells were transfected with HA-ATF4 or ATF4 mutants for 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated in medium minus methionine/cysteine supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at 37°C, then in medium containing [3H]NaAc at 1 mCi/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in lysis buffer (120 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton, pH 8, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 400 nm trichostatin A, protease inhibitors), and immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibody (12CA5, Roche Applied Science).Ubiquitination Assay—293T cells were co-transfected with expression vectors and HA-ubiquitin plasmid. Cell pellets were resuspended in denaturing lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, and 1 mm dithiothreitol), boiled for 10 min, and diluted in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 20 μm MG132 with protease inhibitors, then immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. Ubiquitin species were revealed by Western blotting using anti-HA antibodies.Immunostaining of Cells—The protocol for immunostaining the cells is described in Lassot et al. (21Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-FLAG (M2, Sigma), anti-RNAPollII (8WG16, BabCO), or anti-PML (PG-M3, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with anti-mouse Cy3 antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch), or directly incubated with anti-HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody (3F10, Roche Applied Science). For the second staining, cells were incubated with anti-HA-fluorescein isothiocyanate antibody. Confocal or direct microscopy was carried out under fluorescent light.Luciferase Assays—293T or HeLa cells were plated in 12-well flat bottom plates on the day prior to transfection at a density of 2 × 104 cells/well in DMEM. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method with the Mammalian Transfection Kit (Stratagene) or with oligofectamine (Invitrogen). We used the luciferase reporter 1XAARE-LUC containing sequence placed 5′ to the gene for luciferase. Cells were co-transfected with 1 μg of 1XAARE-LUC, 30 ng of pRL-TK-Renilla (PRL-TK from Promega), and various amounts of plasmids expressing HA-ATF4 or HA-ATF4 mutants, FLAG-p300 and FLAG-p300ΔHAT, or siRNA against p300 as indicated. 24 h post-transfection, cells were lysed and luciferase and Renilla activities were measured with luciferase assay reagent (Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System, Promega) using a Lumat LB9507 luminometer (EG&G instruments). Graphs indicate the average of three independent experiments.RESULTSp300 Enhances ATF4 Stability Independently of Its Acetyltransferase Activity—Because Gachon et al. (15Gachon F. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. Virology. 2002; 299: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) reported recently that ATF4 was acetylated by p300, we investigated the potential role of p300 on ATF4 stability. We found that expression of increasing amounts of p300 leads to the accumulation of endogenous ATF4 (Fig. 1A) and transfected HA-ATF4 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1-3 to lane 4). This effect was specific for p300, because another acetylase, P/CAF, was unable to promote ATF4 accumulation (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 5-7 to lane 8). Surprisingly, p300ΔHAT, an inactive mutant of p300, was still able to accumulate ATF4 (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 9-11 to lane 8), however less efficiently than wild-type p300. We also found, by studying kinetics of ATF4 degradation after cycloheximide treatment, that ATF4 was stabilized by both p300 (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 5-8 to 1-4) and its inactive mutant p300ΔHAT (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 13-16 to 1-4) but not by P/CAF (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 9-12 to 1-4). Indeed, deduced from the scanning of the Western blot shown in Fig. 1C, we found that ∼31% of ATF4 was present after 60 min of cycloheximide treatment, whereas ∼90% of ATF4 was still present in the same conditions in the presence of p300, 85% in the presence of p300ΔHAT, and 36% in the presence of P/CAF.To confirm that p300 regulates ATF4 stability independently of its enzymatic activity, we decided to test the stability of an ATF4-unacetylated mutant. Gachon et al. had shown that ATF4 is acetylated in the bZIP domain, but they did not map a particular residue (15Gachon F. Devaux C. Mesnard J.M. Virology. 2002; 299: 271-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We performed an in vivo acetylation assay using several lysine mutants in the bZIP domain of ATF4 (see Fig. 1D for ATF4 structure), and we found that mutation of the lysine residue 311 (K311R) drastically reduced ATF4 acetylation (Fig. 1E, lane 4). The degradation kinetics of the ATF4K311R mutant was similar to that of wild-type ATF4 (Fig. 1F, compare lanes 4-6 to 1-3), and this mutant was still stabilized by p300 (Fig. 1F, compare lanes 7-9 to 4-6). Overall, these results show that the acetylase p300 is able to stabilize ATF4 independently of its enzymatic activity.p300 Inhibits ATF4 Ubiquitination and Degradation—Because overexpression of p300 leads to ATF4 stabilization, we wanted to check whether inactivation of p300 would destabilize ATF4 and favor its targeting to the ubiquitin proteasome pathway by the SCFβTrCP complex, the E3 ubiquitin ligase for ATF4. For that purpose, we used small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to inactivate endogenous p300, as previously described (26Bres V. Tagami H. Peloponese J.M. Loret E. Jeang K.T. Nakatani Y. Emiliani S. Benkirane M. Kiernan R.E. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6811-6819Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The efficiency of p300 gene silencing by siRNA treatment was assessed by Western blot using anti-p300 antibodies (Fig. 2A). Treatment of HeLa cells with siRNA-inactivating p300 caused a striking diminution in the expression of endogenous ATF4 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1 and 2) as well as transfected HA-ATF4 (Fig. 2C, lanes 1 and 2) up to an almost complete disappearance of both proteins. By contrast, treatment with a control siRNA duplex (siRNA LUC) had no effect (Fig. 2B, lanes 3 and 4 and Fig. 2C, lanes 5 and 6). These results confirm that p300 plays an important role in the control of ATF4 stability. Such a decrease in the level of ATF4 was rescued when cells were treated with MG132 (Fig. 2C, lanes 3 and 4). Indeed, deduced from the scanning of the Western blot, we found that ∼81% of ATF4 was still present when p300 siRNA-treated cells were incubated with MG132, whereas ATF4 was not detected in siRNA p300-treated cells in the absence of MG132. These results suggest that stabilization of ATF4 mediated by p300 interferes with ATF4 targeting to the proteasome. Confirming this hypothesis, we observed less ATF4-ubiquitinated species in the presence of overexpressed FLAG-p300 (Fig. 2D, top panel, compare lane 2 to lane 1), whereas the non-ubiquitinated forms of ATF4 were stabilized (Fig. 2D, bottom panel, compare lane 2 to lane 1). Thus, p300 appears to interfere strongly with the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway to stabilize ATF4 protein.FIGURE 2Silencing of p300 reduces ATF4 expression, and overexpression of p300 inhibits ATF4 ubiquitination and enhances its expression. A, silencing of p300 by siRNA. HeLa cells were transfected by p300 siRNA and p300 was detected by Western blotting using anti-p300 antibodies. B, silencing of p300 expression by siRNAs results in the disappearance of endogenous ATF4. HeLa cells were transfected (+) or not (-) by p300 or luciferase (LUC) siRNAs, and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-ATF4 or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. C, p300 interferes with ATF4 targeting to the proteasome. HeLa cells were transfected with p300 siRNA or Luc siRNA, as indicated, together with HA-ATF4. Cells were treated or not with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and analyzed by Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-α-tubulin antibodies. D, overexpression of p300 decreased ATF4 ubiquitination. 293T cells were co-transfected with FLAG-ATF4, ubiquitin-HA, and FLAG-p300 (lane 2), or only with FLAG-ATF4 and ubiquitin-HA (lane 1) or FLAG-ATF4 (lane 3) or ubiquitin-HA (lane 4), immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and probed with anti-HA (for detection of ubiquitinated ATF4, upper panel) or anti-FLAG antibodies (bottom panel). Because of its high molecular mass, FLAG-p300 is not visible in the part of the gel selected for detection of FLAG-ATF4 ubiquitinated species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The N-terminal Domain of ATF4 Is Required for Interaction with p300—To gain insight into the mechanisms accounting for ATF4 stability, we then asked whether p300 interact with ATF4. By co-immunoprecipitation using anti-ATF4 antibodies, we found that endogenous p300 was indeed associated with endogenous ATF4 (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This interaction was specific, because neither p300 nor ATF4 were found co-immunoprecipitated using an unrelated anti-Raf antibody (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The association between ATF4 and p300 was confirmed in cells transfected with HA-ATF4 and FLAG-p300 by co-immunoprecipitation of HA-ATF4 using anti-FLAG antibodies (Fig. 3B, lane 1). Interestingly, we found that the p300 inactive mutant FLAG-p300ΔHAT, which has conserved the ability to stabilize ATF4 (see Fig. 1), still associated with HA-ATF4 (Fig. 3B, lane 2). In an attempt to further correlate the capacity of p300 to stabilize ATF4 with its ability to interact with ATF4, we decided to map the ATF4 domain required for interaction with p300 in GST pull-down experiments, and then to analyze the effect of p300 on the stability of ATF4 mutants deleted of this domain. We found that ATF4 deleted of residues 1-85 (ATF4Δ1-85) or other larger deletion mutants (ATF4-(152-351) and ATF4-(152-257)), like GST alone used as a control, did not interact with p300 (Fig. 3C, lanes 4-7). In correlation, by contrast with wild-type ATF4 (see Fig. 1B), the stability of the ATF4Δ1-85 mutant was not enhanced by p300 (Fig. 3D). On the contrary, the ATF4 mutant deleted of the bZIP domain, which still interacted with p300 like ATF4 wild-type (see Fig. 3C, lane 3), remained as sensitive as ATF4 wild type to the stabilization mediated by FLAG-p300 (Fig. 3D). These results suggest that p300 needs to interact with ATF4 to promote ATF4 stabilization.FIGURE 3The N-terminal region of ATF4-(1-85) is required for ATF4 binding to p300 and for p300-mediated ATF4 stabilization. A, endogenous p300 and ATF4 are associated in cells. Lysates from 293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-ATF4 antibody (IP α-ATF4) or with the control antibody anti-Raf (IP α-Raf) and analyzed by Western blot using anti-p300 (top) or anti-ATF4 (bottom) antibodies. B, the p300 inactive mutant p300ΔHAT still interacts with HA-ATF4. 293T cells were co-transfected with HA-ATF4 and FLAG-p300 (lane 1), FLAG-p300ΔHAT (lane 2), the empty vector (lane 3), or with FLAG-p300 alone (lane 4), immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies. C, ATF4 residues 1-85 are required for p300-ATF4 interaction. Lysates from 293T cells expressing FLAG-p300 were used in GST pull-down experiments with bacterially expressed ATF4 wt or various ATF4 deletion mutants fused to GST (lanes 2-6). FLAG-p300 bound to the GST-ATF4 constructs was detected by Western blot with anti-FLAG antibodies. 10% of the cell lysate used in the pull-down experiments was loaded in the Input lane 1. D, stabilization of ATF4 by p300 depends on ATF4 residues 1-85 but not on the ATF4 bZIP region. 293T cells were co-transfected with wild type HA-ATF4, HA-ATF4Δ1-85, or HA-ATF4 ΔbZIP and plasmids expressing FLAG-p300 (right panels) or the corresponding empty vector (left panels). Cells were treated with cycloheximide at the indicated times, lysed, and probed with anti-HA or anti-α-tubulin antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)p300 Recruits ATF4 into Nuclear Speckles and Protects It from Proteasome Degradation—When expressed separately, both FLAG-p300 and HA-ATF4 showed a uniform nuclear staining (Fig. 4A, top two left panels). However, when co-expressed simultaneously, FLAG-p300 and HA-ATF4 were co-localized in nuclear speckles (Fig. 4A, second row). Importantly, the simple stabilization and enhancement of HA-ATF4 expression obtained by addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was not sufficient to promote the recruitment of HA-ATF4 into nuclear speckles (Fig. 4A, right top panel). HA-ATF4Δ1-85 that was unable to interact with p300 (see Fig. 3C) was not recruited into nuclear speckles when overexpressed with FLAG-p300 (Fig. 4A, third row). By contrast, the mutant ATF4K311R, which could not be acetylated but still interacted with p300, could be recruited into nuclear speckles (Fig. 4A, fourth row). Hence, the recruitment of overexpressed HA-ATF4 into nuclear speckles when co-expressed with FLAG-p300 correlates with the ability of ATF4 to interact with p300 and not with its high level of expression. The recruitment of HA-ATF4 into nuclear speckles by p300 seemed also independent of p300 enzymatic activity, because an inactive mutant of p300, p300ΔHAT, was still able to delocalize ATF4 in nuclear speckles (Fig. 4A, fifth row). Interestingly, p300 mediated redistribution of ATF4 in nuclear speckles where ATF4 co-localized with the RNA polymerase II (Fig. 4B, the two upper panels). This suggests, in addition to the transcriptional studies in Fig. 6, a functional role of p300 in ATF4 transcriptional activity. These structures co-localized also partially with PML (Fig. 4B, middle and lower panels).FIGURE 4p300 recruits ATF4 in nuclear speckles independently of p300 acetyltransferase activity. A, p300 and ATF4 co-localize in nuclear speckles. HeLa cells were transfected together or separately with HA-ATF4 or ATF4 mutants as indicated, and FLAG-p300 or FLAG-p300ΔHAT, treated or not with MG132 (top right panel), fixed, and stained with primary anti-HA (coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate) or anti-FLAG antibodies (red), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. B, nuclear speckles co-localized with RNA polymerase II and partially with some PML nuclear bodies. HeLa cells transfected with HA-ATF4 and FLAG-p300 were fixed and stained with primary anti-RNApolII or anti-PML antibodies and with anti-HA (coupled to fluorescein isothiocyanate), and analyzed by confocal microscopy. C, ATF4 is protected against degradation in nuclear speckles. HeLa cells were transfected with HA-ATF4, alone or with FLAG-p300, treated with cycloheximide for the indicated times, and then analyzed by immunofluorescence using anti-HA antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 6p300 enhances ATF4-mediated transcription independently of its acetyltransferase activity.

Averages of three independent experiments are represented. B, silencing of p300 expression by siRNAs reduces ATF4 transcriptional activity. HeLa cells were co-transfected (+) or not (-) by p300 siRNAs and with or without ATF4 and a 1XAARE-TK-LUC vector. C, p300ΔHAT still enhances ATF4 transcriptional activity. The experiment was performed as in A using p300 or p300ΔHAT expression vectors. Cells were incubated in DMEM containing leucine. D, transcriptional activity of ATF4K311R mutant is comparable to ATF4 wild type. The experiment was performed as in A using increasing amounts (0.01 to 0.5 μg) of ATF4 mutants expression vectors. E, p300 increases the transcriptional activity of ATF4 wild-type and ATF4-K311R. The experiment was performed as in A using p300 and ATF4 mutants expression vectors.

https://openalex.org/W2125861763,"Human G protein-coupled formyl peptide receptor like 1 (FPRL1) and its mouse homologue murine formyl peptide receptor 2 (mFPR2) mediate the chemotactic activity of amyloid β 1–42 (Aβ42), a key pathogenic peptide in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since mFPR2 is up-regulated in mouse microglia by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Toll-like receptor 4 ligand, we investigated the capacity of CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), a Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9 ligand, to regulate the expression of mFPR2 in mouse microglia. CpG ODN markedly enhanced the expression and function of mFPR2 in microglial cells, which exhibited increased chemotactic responses to mFPR2 agonists, including Aβ42. The effect of CpG ODN is dependent on activation of p38 MAPK. Further studies showed that CpG ODN-treated microglia increased their capacity to endocytose Aβ42 through mFPR2, as this process was abrogated by pertussis toxin, a Gi protein inhibitor, and W peptide, another potent mFPR2 agonist. Our results suggest that TLR9 may play an important role in promoting microglial recognition of Aβ42, thus affecting the pathogenic process of AD."
https://openalex.org/W2059806137,"Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum minichromosome maintenance complex (mtMCM), a cellular replicative helicase, is a useful model for the more complex eukaryotic MCMs. Biochemical and crystallographic evidence indicates that mtMCM assembles as a double hexamer (dHex), but previous electron microscopy studies reported only the presence of single heptamers or single hexamers (Pape, T., Meka, H., Chen, S., Vicentini, G., Van Heel, M., and Onesti, S. (2003) EMBO Rep. 4, 1079-1083; Yu, X., VanLoock, M. S., Poplawski, A., Kelman, Z., Xiang, T., Tye, B. K., and Egelman, E. H. (2002) EMBO Rep. 3, 792-797). Here we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of the full-length mtMCM dHex in which two hexamers contact each other via the structurally well defined N-terminal domains. The dHex has obvious side openings that resemble the side channels of LTag (large T antigen). 6-fold and 7-fold rings were observed in the same mtMCM preparation, but we determined that assembly as a double ring favors 6-fold structures. Additionally, open rings were also detected, which suggests a direct mtMCM loading mechanism onto DNA. Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum minichromosome maintenance complex (mtMCM), a cellular replicative helicase, is a useful model for the more complex eukaryotic MCMs. Biochemical and crystallographic evidence indicates that mtMCM assembles as a double hexamer (dHex), but previous electron microscopy studies reported only the presence of single heptamers or single hexamers (Pape, T., Meka, H., Chen, S., Vicentini, G., Van Heel, M., and Onesti, S. (2003) EMBO Rep. 4, 1079-1083; Yu, X., VanLoock, M. S., Poplawski, A., Kelman, Z., Xiang, T., Tye, B. K., and Egelman, E. H. (2002) EMBO Rep. 3, 792-797). Here we present the first three-dimensional electron microscopy reconstruction of the full-length mtMCM dHex in which two hexamers contact each other via the structurally well defined N-terminal domains. The dHex has obvious side openings that resemble the side channels of LTag (large T antigen). 6-fold and 7-fold rings were observed in the same mtMCM preparation, but we determined that assembly as a double ring favors 6-fold structures. Additionally, open rings were also detected, which suggests a direct mtMCM loading mechanism onto DNA. Throughout nature, replication of DNA begins with the ordered assembly of a number of proteins at the replication origin.

These features make mtMCM a simpler experimental model for studying helicase function in DNA replication in both archaeal and eukaryotic systems. mtMCM is purified as an oligomer of 850-950 kDa, consistent with the mass of a dodecamer (5Kelman Z.

The archaeal protein and all eukaryotic MCMs share a well conserved C-terminal domain, which includes the ATPase Walker motifs (8Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys.

The crystal structure of the mtMCM N-terminal domain (N-mtMCM) reveals a cylindrical structure formed by two hexameric rings bound head to head and traversed by a positively charged channel (9Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Previous EM studies of the full-length protein have produced single 6-fold and 7-fold ring images (10Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H.

Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Until now, the double hexamer (dHex) structure of mtMCM has not been reported. The simian virus 40 large T antigen (SV40 LTag) is a functional homolog of MCM and is the most extensively studied model system for eukaryotic helicases (13Fanning E. Knippers R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 55-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). LTag assembles as a head-to-head oriented dHex on the viral origin of replication (ori), with the C-terminal helicase domains forming the outer tiers of the cylinder and the DNA binding domains in the equator (14Valle M. Gruss C. Halmer L. Carazo J.M. Donate L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Gómez-Lorenzo M.G. Valle M. Frank J. Gruss C. Sorzano C.O. Chen X.S. Donate L.E. Carazo J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The atomic structure of the LTag helicase domain shows a hexameric ring with side channels that are proposed to be exit points for single-stranded DNA during the unwinding reaction (16Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Similar side channels have been observed in the hexameric ring of mtMCM (11Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. Heel Van M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Recent EM evidence indicates that the LTag N-terminal region, including its origin-binding domain, is highly flexible in the absence of DNA and requires dHex formation on the viral ori to adopt a stable structure. 3M. K. Valle, X. S. Chen, L. E. Donate, E. Fanning, and J. M. Carazo, submitted for publication. Here, we report the EM study of full-length mtMCM, which revealed considerable polymorphism. Analysis of the end-on view of the ring-shaped complex revealed several oligomeric forms of mtMCM, including 6-fold, 7-fold, and open rings. However, analysis of the side views indicated that in the double ring the 6-fold arrangement was preferred, forming the dHex architecture. We present the detailed analysis of the data for the three-dimensional reconstruction of the mtMCM dHex in the context of the current knowledge about the N-mtMCM and LTag structures. Protein Purification—The mtMCM N-terminal fragment (residues 2-286) was produced as described by Fletcher et al. in 2003 (9Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The full-length mtMCM was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified from Escherichia coli cells. The GST-mtMCM fusion protein in the supernatant of cell lysates was purified using glutathione affinity column chromatography in a buffer containing 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. After thrombin cleavage, Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography was used to further purify and characterize the mtMCM cleaved from the GST fusion protein. The molecular weight of the elution peak of the protein was estimated using the standard curve obtained by plotting the logarithm of the molecular weight of the known proteins against the elution volume (ml) for the Superose 6 column. Sample Preparation for EM—Protein samples were diluted to ∼100 μg/ml (mtMCM) or 200 μg/ml (N-mtMCM) in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, and 10 mm dithiothreitol with or without nucleotide and incubated as described in Fig. 2. For the NaCl concentration screening, samples were dialyzed for 1 h at room temperature against 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and the appropriate NaCl concentration. Samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged, collodion/carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined in a JEOL 1200 EX-II transmission electron microscope at 80 kV and 60,000× magnification. Micrographs were taken on Kodak SO-163 plates under low dose conditions. Image Processing—Micrographs were digitized in a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a pixel size of 7 μm, then down-sampled to 21 μm (3.5 Å in the sample). Image preprocessing, particle picking, two-dimensional alignment, and classification were performed using XMIPP (18Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martín M.C. Marco S. Fernández J.J. de la Fraga L.G.

Pascual-Montano A. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Ringshaped or rectangle-shaped particles were manually picked, extracted in 64 × 64 (rings) or 128 × 128 (rectangles) pixel images, and independently processed. Images were normalized, centered, and aligned in two dimensions using a reference-free method (20Penczek P. Radermacher M. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1992; 40: 33-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar, 21Marco S. Chagoyen M. de la Fraga L.G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Classification was performed before or after alignment using Kernel Probability Density Estimator Self-Organizing Maps (22Pascual-Montano A. Donate L.E. Valle M. Bárcena M. Pascual-Marquí R.D. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Images in the resulting groups were realigned before calculating averages. Two-dimensional resolution was calculated using the spectral signal-to-noise ratio method with the threshold set at 4 (23Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional Reconstruction—Synthetic N-mtMCM double pentamer and double heptamer models were created with Amira (www.amiravis.com) and MOLEMAN2 (24Kleywegt G.J. Zou J.Y. Kjeldgaard M. Jones T.A. Rossmann M.G. Arnold E. International Tables for Crystallography: Crystallography of Biological Macromolecules. F. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2001: 353-356Google Scholar). Atomic coordinates for one monomer in each hexamer of the N-mtMCM structure (Protein Data Bank identifier 1LTL) were translated to adjust the ring radius and then rotated to generate the corresponding C5 or C7 symmetry-related copies. All reference volumes were created from the coordinates with a 3.5-Å pixel size and low pass filtered to 22 Å. To eliminate symmetry information, volumes were rotationally averaged using XMIPP. Projection matching three-dimensional orientation search was carried out with SPIDER (25Frank J. Radermacher M. Penczek P. Zhu J. Li Y. Ladjadj M. Leith A. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 190-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar). Final reconstructions were calculated with ART (26Marabini R. Herman G.T. Carazo J.M. Ultramicroscopy. 1998; 72: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Resolution was estimated using the three-dimensional spectral signal-to-noise ratio equals 1 criterion (27Unser M. Sorzano C.O. Thevenaz P. Jonic S. El-Bez C. De Carlo S. Conway J.F. Trus B.L. J. Struct. Biol. 2005; 149: 243-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Surface rendering was done with Amira. Modeling—Atomic coordinates for the N-mtMCM structure and the helicase domain of SV40 LTag (Protein Data Bank identifier 1N25) were manually fitted to the mtMCM reconstruction using Amira. Correlation coefficients between the N-mtMCM structure (before and after increasing the relative ring rotation) and the dHex three-dimensional EM reconstruction were calculated within a cylindrical mask using SPIDER. Structural Polymorphism—The mtMCM protein complex expressed and purified from E. coli behaved as a dodecamer in gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1A), which is consistent with prior reports (5Kelman Z. Lee J.K. Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Chong J.P. Hayashi M.K. Simon M.N. Xu R.M. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When examined under EM by negative stain, this mtMCM preparation displayed two different types of morphology, namely ring-shaped objects, consistent with top views of either a single or a double ring, and rectangle-shaped particles with four density bands, consistent with side views of a double ring (Fig. 1B). In view of recent reports showing 6-fold and 7-fold architectures of mtMCM (10Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. Heel Van M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), we experimented with a range of buffer conditions (i.e. different NaCl concentration, presence of Mg and NTP, and temperature) to search for a homogeneous population. Ring and rectangle views were observed in most of the different buffering conditions used, and they were separately picked and analyzed for variability using self-organizing map classification techniques (22Pascual-Montano A. Donate L.E. Valle M. Bárcena M. Pascual-Marquí R.D. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In all cases, analysis of ring views (Fig. 2) revealed a mixture of 6-fold and 7-fold symmetry forms. Furthermore, open ring forms were also found in considerable amounts in two of the conditions (Fig. 2, bottom two rows). Views consistent with projections of tilted single rings were also observed. Double Rings of mtMCM Are dHexs—The rectangle-shaped, four-banded side views in the mtMCM preparations were unequivocally consistent with a double ring architecture. Therefore, these were used to obtain a three-dimensional reconstruction. Double ring side views from the batch of experiments performed at 25 °C in the absence of NTP (Fig. 2) were pooled to make an initial data set of 8883 particles and then aligned. In parallel, a preparation of the isolated N-mtMCM fragment, known to be dHex from the crystal structure (9Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), was also subjected to negative stain, EM, and two-dimensional alignment. Comparison of the average side view of mtMCM with the average side view of N-mtMCM clearly indicated that the N-mtMCM corresponds to the two central bands in the two-dimensional projection of the full-length protein (Fig. 3A). It was also evident from all the side view data sets of the full-length mtMCM (Fig. 2) that these two central bands were always better defined and gave a stronger signal than the two distal segments. For the three-dimensional reconstruction of mtMCM, particle orientations were found using a three-dimensional projection matching technique (28Penczek P.A. Grassucci R.A. Frank J. Ultramicroscopy. 1994; 53: 251-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Because the two-dimensional analysis showed that the N-terminal domain gave the sharpest signal, the orientation search was based in this region. Furthermore, the availability of a high resolution structure for this domain (9Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) immediately suggested an initial reference volume. However, because 6-fold, 7-fold, and sometimes other oligomeric forms had been detected in the top view analysis, we were uncertain about the number of monomers (and therefore the symmetry) in the double rings observed in side view. To tackle this problem, three initial reference volumes with no symmetry assumed were created by rotationally averaging either the low pass filtered N-mtMCM dHex structure (Fig. 3B), a synthetic N-mtMCM double heptamer, or a synthetic N-mtMCM double pentamer. These were then used to create reference projections for the first iteration of three independent orientation search processes. Subsequent iterations used as a reference the volume created from the mtMCM data set with the angles found in the previous round. Reconstructions and reference projections were calculated from the whole particle, whereas angle search was restricted to a sphere with radius 77 Å centered at the center of the volume, which amply included the N-terminal region. No symmetry was imposed throughout angle search or reconstruction. After reaching convergence, final volumes were computed and their rotational symmetry assessed slice by slice. Both the volumes calculated using the rotationally averaged dHex (Fig. 3B) or the double pentamer (not shown) as an initial reference showed a clear predominance of the 6-fold harmonic over the 5-fold and 7-fold, whereas the volume calculated with the double heptamer as the initial model showed very poor values for all three symmetries (not shown). We conclude from this result that most (if not all) of the double ring structures correspond to mtMCM dHexs. Structure of the mtMCM dHex—Once the oligomeric state of the double rings had been determined, an in-depth analysis of the side view variability was carried out. To avoid mixing structural and orientation heterogeneity, the three-dimensional orientation data found with the N-mtMCM rotationally averaged dodecamer as the initial model were used to discard images not corresponding to strict side views (tilt angle >15°). A self-organizing map (Fig. 3C, left) of the remaining particles showed some groups of particles with one or two bands that were extremely ill defined. Images in these groups were not considered further. The remaining projections (corresponding to side views with all four segments well defined) were again aligned in two dimensions and subjected to classification. The new self-organizing map (Fig. 3C, right), which should mainly account for variability due to different rotations around the cylinder axis and to genuine structural differences, confirmed that the two central bands, corresponding to the mtMCM N-terminal domain, are always better defined than the outer segments, which correspond to the helicase C-terminal domains and give a blurred projection. This indicates that the mtMCM C-terminal domain displays a larger variability than the N-terminal region. The final data set, containing only strict side views with the four segments well defined and adequately covering the angular space of rotation around the longitudinal axis, was used to obtain the 25-Å resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction of the mtMCM dHex (Fig. 4A). This reconstruction used a low pass filtered version of the N-mtMCM dodecamer structure as an initial model, and the orientation search was restricted to the N-terminal domain. No symmetry was imposed throughout orientation search and reconstruction, but C6 symmetry was applied to the final volume after filtering to the estimated resolution. A total of 1,256 particles were included in the final map calculation. The dHex of mtMCM is a four-tiered cylinder formed by two rings arranged head to head through their N-terminal domains. The C-terminal helicase domains form the outer tiers of the cylinder. Each tier is slightly rotated with respect to its neighbors, giving a total torsion of ∼24° from one C-terminal to the other (Fig. 4B). A channel runs along the longitudinal axis of the cylinder, and side openings appear between monomers in each ring at the transition between the N- and C-terminal regions. The central channel dimensions (at least 25-Å-wide, 182-Å-long, Fig. 4A) are large enough to accommodate ∼54 bp of B-form double-stranded DNA. The diameter of the side openings varies from 11 to 25 Å. Weak density is present in the central channel (Fig. 4C) and is also observed in some top view averages (Fig. 2). A model for the full-length mtMCM structure was built by combining the atomic coordinates of N-mtMCM (9Fletcher R.J. Bishop B.E. Leon R.P. Sclafani R.A. Ogata C.M. Chen X.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and domains D2 and D3 of the helicase domain of its functional homolog, SV40 LTag (16Li D. Zhao R. Lilyestrom W. Gai D. Zhang R. DeCaprio J.A. Fanning E. Jochimiak A. Szakonyi G. Chen X.S. Nature. 2003; 423: 512-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). These domains form the outermost tier in the LTag dHex and contain the AAA+ sequence motifs. Domain D1, corresponding to the LTag Zn-binding domain, overlapped with the N-mtMCM region and thus was not included in the model. As expected from the side view two-dimensional analysis (Fig. 3A), the dHex N-mtMCM structure fits the two central tiers of the mtMCM map very well (correlation coefficient = 0.830), and a slightly better fit was obtained by increasing the rotation between hexamers by 5° (correlation coefficient = 0.834). Fitting of the SV40 LTag helicase domain onto the outer tiers of the mtMCM map resulted in a volume highly similar to that of the EM reconstruction, including the existence of side openings in each monomer (Fig. 5A). The combined fitted N-mtMCM and D2-D3 LTag domains amount to a total of 512 residues. Given that mtMCM is 666 residues long, density is lacking for ∼150 residues, and these presumably lie in the C-terminal region of each monomer (Fig. 5B). A model has been proposed whereby these C-terminal residues form a belt around the interface between the mtMCM N-terminal and C-terminal tiers (11Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. Heel Van M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In our dHex mtMCM map there is no empty density at this interface. However, we did observe extreme flexibility in the outer tiers of the complex (Fig. 3C), and weak density was present in the channel (Fig. 4C). It is possible that the non-modeled flexible residues may adopt highly variable conformations around the helicase domain and even occasionally in the channel, accounting for the weak density in our reconstructed dHex map. Previous EM studies have shown that the archaeal helicase mtMCM is able to adopt three different oligomeric arrangements, namely hexameric rings, heptameric rings, and helical polymers (10Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 11Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. Heel Van M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Chen Y.J. Yu X. Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For the first time, we report the presence of the dHex structure in an EM study. In addition, we found other oligomeric forms, including 6-fold and 7-fold closed ring structures and, to a lesser extent, open ring structures in the same mtMCM preparation. Interestingly, the mtMCM protein complex behaved like a single oligomeric species when assayed in solution by Superose 6 or Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography; the single elution peak position had an apparent molecular weight consistent with that of a dHex. Caution must be used when relating the oligomerization state of engineered proteins observed in vitro to their function(s) in vivo, especially in ring-forming complexes that can adopt different stoichiometries with minor adjustments of the monomer-monomer interface (see, for example, Refs. 29Toth E.A. Li Y. Sawaya M.R. Cheng Y. Ellenberger T. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 1113-1123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar and 30Trus B.L. Cheng N. Newcomb W.W. Homa F.L. Brown J.C. Steven A.C. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 12668-12671Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have even observed a small population of 8-fold ring structures in mtMCM preparations obtained with a slightly different purification protocol (not shown). However, the fact that all these architectures coexist in the same preparation is an indication of polymorphism in the assembly of mtMCM and possibly of equilibrium between these various forms. It is not possible to know if the ring-shaped particles in our preparations correspond to end-on views (viewing along the central channel) of single or double rings. On the other hand, we found rectangle-shaped particles clearly consistent with side views of a double ring arrangement. However, it was unclear if the double ring was hexameric or heptameric. We have shown that despite the structural heterogeneity present in the preparation, the double ring architecture favors 6-fold symmetric arrangements. Although the functional relevance of each of the structural arrangements is not clear at present, a 6-fold dHex form would correlate best with the presence of six MCM components in the eukaryotic Mcm2-Mcm7complex (31Tye B.K. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), as well as with the high resolution structure of N-mtMCM and the biochemical analysis in solution (5Kelman Z.

A double ring assembly is required in SV40 LTag for the replication of viral DNA, even though single hexamers of LTag also have helicase activity (reviewed in Refs. 32Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sclafani R.A. Fletcher R.J. Chen X.S. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2039-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, the helicase activity of single hexamers of LTag is 15 times lower than that of dHexs (34Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Alexandrov A.I. Botchan M.R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44886-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In mtMCM, multiple point mutations at the hexamer-hexamer interface have proven the critical role of these residues for dHex formation, and the single hexamer mutants also had reduced helicase activity (36Fletcher R.J. Shen J. Gómez-Llorente Y. San Martín C. Carazo J.M. Chen X.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 10.1074/jbc.M509773200Google Scholar). Our three-dimensional reconstruction of the double ring allows direct observation of the dodecameric MCM complex for the first time. It highlights characteristics similar to those found for LTag, such as the head-to-head arrangement of hexamers, a central channel, and side openings in each hexamer (14Valle M. Gruss C. Halmer L. Carazo J.M. Donate L.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 15Gómez-Lorenzo M.G. Valle M. Frank J. Gruss C. Sorzano C.O. Chen X.S. Donate L.E. Carazo J.M.

However, our data show that, unlike in LTag, the mtMCM DNA binding domain is more rigid than the C-terminal helicase domain. This structural difference probably reflects functional differences between the two systems. The LTag dHex is specifically formed on the unique viral ori in the presence of ATP and without the help of any accessory proteins. In LTag, monomers assemble around the specific ori DNA to form two hexameric rings (37Dean F.B. Borowiec J.A. Eki T. Hurwitz J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14129-14137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas mtMCM forms dodecameric ring structures in solution in the absence of any cofactor and may rely on ORC-CDC6 to recognize the origin of replication and to be recruited and loaded onto the DNA (38Kelman L.M. Kelman Z. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 48: 605-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain in LTag is a rather flexible structure that only becomes further structured upon interaction with the other hexamer in the dHex and the DNA 3M. K. Valle, X. S. Chen, L. E. Donate, E. Fanning, and J. M. Carazo, submitted for publication.; this flexibility is required for its specific assembly. In contrast, MCM itself does not seem to perform an origin recognition function, and its N-terminal region is very well structured both in the dHex reported here and in previous EM studies of single hexamers (11Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. Heel Van M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 12Chen Y.J. Yu X. Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It is very tempting to speculate that this absence of flexibility in the MCM system as compared with that of LTag is correlated with a concomitant absence of functionality for specific origin DNA recognition. Interestingly, it is the C-terminal (helicase) region of MCM that presents some structural flexibility, as shown by its reduced density in the dHex three-dimensional reconstruction. Indeed, its flexibility is found to be greater than it is in the LTag system (15Gómez-Lorenzo M.G. Valle M. Frank J. Gruss C. Sorzano C.O. Chen X.S. Donate L.E. Carazo J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6205-6213Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), 3M. K. Valle, X. S. Chen, L. E. Donate, E. Fanning, and J. M. Carazo, submitted for publication. suggesting that a more controlled regulation of the helicase function is required in the MCM system. The presence of open ring forms, reported here for the first time, suggests that the loading of mtMCM onto DNA could be achieved through a ring-opening mechanism even in the absence of a ring loader, similar to that proposed for the bacteriophage T7 helicase/primase (39Ahnert P. Picha K.M. Patel S.S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3418-3427Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) or the bacterial Rho transcription terminator (40Skordalakes E. Berger J.M. Cell. 2003; 114: 135-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The putative loaders mtCdc6-1 and -2 might regulate mtMCM ring opening when placed in the vicinity of DNA. The disordered C-terminal residues for which there is no density in our model may also play a role in ring remodeling upon interaction with other components of the replisome. An unstructured C-terminal region of ∼80 residues is also present in LTAg. This C-terminal fragment plays a role in establishing productive infection of SV40 in certain cell types but is dispensable for viral DNA replication (17Pipas J.M. J. Virol. 1985; 54: 569-575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Simmons D.T. Adv. Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In conclusion, the overall dHex structure of mtMCM reported here exhibits high similarity to that of LTag, including the head-to-head configuration of two hexamers and the presence of the obvious side channels that could be used for extruding unwound single-stranded DNA loops. This structural similarity between mtMCM and LTag may be a reflection of their similar function in unwinding DNA for replication. The open ring conformation of mtMCM oligomers offers a possible mechanism for the loading of mtMCM onto the origin DNA. We thank Dr. R. Marabini and R. Núñez for helpful discussion and suggestions and Dr. M. K. Valle for carefully reading the manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2075799243,"Recent evidence suggests that polycystin-1 (PC1) acts as a mechanosensor, receiving signals from the primary cilia, neighboring cells, and extracellular matrix and transduces them into cellular responses that regulate proliferation, adhesion, and differentiation that are essential for the control of renal tubules and kidney morphogenesis. PC1 has an unusually long extracellular region (∼3000 amino acids) with a multimodular structure. Proteins with a similar architecture have structural and mechanical roles. Based on the structural similarities between PC1 and other modular proteins that have elastic properties we hypothesized that PC1 functions mechanically by providing a flexible and elastic linkage between cells. Here we directly tested this hypothesis by analyzing the mechanical properties of the entire PC1 extracellular region by using single molecule force spectroscopy. We show that the PC1 extracellular region is highly extensible and that this extensibility is mainly caused by the unfolding of its Ig-like domains. Stretching the native PC1 extracellular region results in a sawtooth pattern with equally spaced force peaks that have a wide range of unfolding forces (50-200 pN). By combining single-molecule force spectroscopy and protein engineering techniques, we demonstrate that the sawtooth pattern in native PC1 extracellular region corresponds to the sequential unfolding of individual Ig-like domains. We found that Ig-like domains refold after mechanical unfolding. Hence, the PC1 extracellular region displays a dynamic extensibility whereby the resting length might be regulated through unfolding/refolding of its Ig-like domains. These force-driven reactions may be important for cell elasticity and the regulation of cell signaling events mediated by PC1.

The human kidney is composed of roughly one million nephrons that must develop and maintain their glomerulus-tubule structure to function properly.

In ADPKD, cysts develop from renal tubules and enlarge dramatically, compress the normal parenchyma and ultimately cause renal failure in more than 50% of the affected individuals (1Gabow P.A. Am. J.

In ADPKD the sensing mechanisms for tubule size appear to be lost, and cysts develop and enlarge progressively, in a process that ultimately causes renal failure (3Wilson D.W. Burrow C.R. Exp.

The function of PC1, as well as the mechanisms whereby mutations in this protein lead to the pathogenesis of the disease, remain unknown. In particular, it is not known how PC1 senses the size of the renal tubules, or how this protein controls cell growth and the development of the tubular phenotype.PC1 is a large (∼520 kDa) membrane protein with an extensive N-terminal extracellular portion, comprising some 3,000 amino acids (Fig. 1). This part contains a novel combination of domains: leucine-rich repeats (LRR), a WSC (cell wall integrity and stress response component), a C-type lectin domain, a low density lipoprotein-like domain (LDL domain), 16 copies of a novel immunoglobulin (Ig)-like fold, the polycystic kidney disease (PKD) domain, and a region that extends for ∼1000 amino acids that is homologous to a sea urchin protein called receptor for egg jelly (REJ) (6Hughes J.

Recent data indicated that PC1 may function as a cell adhesion receptor involved in cell-cell or cell-matrix interactions (10Ibraghimov-Beskrovnaya O. Bukanov N.O. Donohue L.C. Dackowski W.R.

Alenghat F.J. Luo Y. Williams E. Vassilev P. Li X. Elia A.E. Lu W. Brown E.M. Quinn S.J. Ingber D.E. Zhou J. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 14Chauvet V.

All of these proteins contain Ig-like domains arranged in tandem. Recent single molecule experiments have shown that such proteins are highly extensible and elastic.Based on the structural similarities between PC1 and other modular proteins that have elastic properties we hypothesized that that PC1 functions mechanically by providing a flexible and elastic linkage between cells. The mechanical properties of PC1 may be vital for maintaining the architectural integrity of the kidney. Mutations may alter PC1 cell adhesion and mechanical properties and lead to the alterations in cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions and abnormal tissue development, which are characteristic of ADPKD.To understand how PC1 senses and mediates mechanical forces a detailed knowledge of its mechanical properties at the molecular level is needed. One technique that has been extremely useful in measuring the mechanical properties of single proteins is single molecule force spectroscopy (19Fisher T.E. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 379-384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). In this technique one uses the cantilever tip of an atomic force microscope (AFM) to pick up and stretch single molecules from their N and C termini. Such experiments have been extremely useful in analyzing the fundamental biophysical properties of proteins that are exposed to mechanical forces (15Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F. Fernandez J.M.

Indeed a recent study demonstrated that the first five PKD domains have remarkably high mechanical stability, suggesting that the PC1 extracellular domain may have a load-bearing function where most modules are designed to resist denaturation when exposed to mechanical forces (24Forman J.R. Qamar S. Paci E. Sandford R.N. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). However, these domains comprise only a small fraction (∼15%) of the long PC1 extracellular region, and it is likely that the other PKD domains may have different mechanical stabilities, as shown for other modular Ig-like proteins such as titin (16Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and fibronectin (17Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 31: 433-447Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Also, the mechanical stability of the long REJ region is not known. This information is essential to better define the putative mechanical role of PC1.Here, we directly examined the mechanical properties of the entire extracellular region of PC1 using single molecule force spectroscopy. This technique offers the most direct way of studying the stability and elasticity of proteins that are exposed to mechanical forces and hence more closely resemble the conditions found in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning and Expression of Fragments of PC1 Extracellular Region Proteins in Mammalian Cells—We cloned and expressed the following constructs (Fig. 1): 1) the full-length human PC1 N-terminal extracellular region (AF20-Fc; amino acids 1-3048), 2) a fragment encompassing the first 412 amino acids containing the signal peptide (SP), LRR domains (amino acids 33-180), the WSC domain (amino acids 181-240), and the first PKD domain (amino acids 268-354) plus the last 180 amino acids (QIF-2; this construct is derived from AF20-Fc by deleting a fragment corresponding to amino acids 413-2963), 3) a fragment containing the SP plus the last 1394 amino acids containing PKD domains 13-16 and the complete REJ region (QIF-4), and 4) a control fragment containing just the SP and the Fc fragment (QIF-8; 296 amino acids long). These constructs were fused into a modified pCI vector (Promega) with an Fc fragment of human IgG1 plus a Stop codon at its C terminus.PC1 ectodomain is rich in cysteine residues, and hence its folding or structure may be sensitive to oxidizing/reducing conditions as shown for VCAM-1 (25Bhasin N. Carl P. Harper S. Feng G. Lu H. Speicher D.W. Discher D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45865-45874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Hence all the protein constructs, except for the PKD no. 1-I27 polyprotein, were expressed and purified in the absence of DTT or any other reducing agent.To express the different protein fragments, we transfected HEK293 cells using Lipofectamine2000 (2.5 μl of reagent for 1 μg of DNA; 20 μg of plasmid for each 150-mm plate). After 6 h, the medium was changed to OptiMEM and incubated for 48 h. After 48 h, the medium was harvested, and the proteins were purified using protein G-agarose beads (Amersham Biosciences). The beads were washed three times with 1 ml of PBS with 0.5% Triton X-100, and the proteins were eluted by 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The eluates were neutralized by adding 1 volume of 0.5 m PBS, pH 7.2 (no DTT). The integrity of the proteins was verified by Western blots using a 4-15% SDS gel using anti-human Fc (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories).Cloning and Expression of PKD Domains 6-10 in Bacteria—A construct coding for PC1 PKD domains 6-10 was obtained by PCR using the pCI-PKD1-FLAG vector (26Hanaoka K. Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Piontek K. Tsiokas L. Sukhatme V.P. Guggino W.B. Germino G.G. Nature. 2000; 408: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The corresponding protein sequence is from EELRGLS at the N terminus to SIFVYVL at the C terminus, with a molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. The DNA was subcloned into the pQ80E expression vector, which has a His6 tag at the N terminus, and the vector was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen). Transformed colonies were grown overnight at 37 °C in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. The overnight culture was reinoculated into fresh LB medium, and the cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A at 600 nm reached 0.6. The cells were collected by centrifugation and sonicated. The insoluble pellet fraction was resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 8 m urea. The solublized pellet was renatured initially by dialyzing against Tris-HCl buffer containing 500 mm urea. The solubilized pellet was then dialysed against the same buffer without urea and centrifuged. The supernatant of the renatured solubilized pellet was purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography. The protein was kept at 4 °C. We also attempted to express other protein fragments containing other PKD domains but encountered difficulties at the level of expression and/or purification making them unsuitable for AFM studies.Cloning and Expression of a PKD Domain 1-Titin I27 Heteropolyprotein—We cloned and expressed in bacteria a heteropolyprotein based on the first PKD domain (PKD no. 1, residues Val268-Glu354) and the titin immunoglobulin domain 27 (I27). The I27 domain has been extensively studied by force spectroscopy and hence serves as an internal fingerprint (16Li H. Linke W.A. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Kerkvliet J.G. Lu H. Marszalek P.E. Fernandez J.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 998-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 17Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 31: 433-447Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar). We assembled an I27-PKD no. 1 heteropolyprotein using a multiple step cloning technique that makes use of four restriction sequences (BamHI, BglII, BstY, and KpnI) to three multiples of the I27-PKD no. 1 dimer (21Carrion-Vazquez M. Oberhauser A.F. Fowler S.B. Marszalek P.E. Broedel S.E. Clarke J. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3694-3699Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The polyprotein was cloned in an E. coli recombination-defective strain, Sure-2 (Stratagene), and expressed in the BLR (DE3) strain (Novagen). The cells were lysed with Triton X-100 and then purified by Ni2+ or Co2+ affinity chromatography. The protein was kept in PBS containing 5 mm DTT and 0.2 mm EDTA at 4 °C.Single Molecule AFM—The mechanical properties of single PC1 proteins were studied using a home-built single molecule atomic force microscope (AFM) that consists of a detector head (Digital Instruments) mounted on top of a single axis piezoelectric positioner with a strain gauge sensor (P841.10, Physik Instrumente). The P841 has a total travel of 15 μm, and it is attached to two piezo-electric positioners (P280.10A, Physik Instrumente) that are used to control the x and y positions. This system has a z-axis resolution of a few nanometers and can measure forces in the range of 10-10,000 pN. The monitoring of the force reported by the cantilever, and the control of the movement of the piezoelectric positioners, are achieved by means of two data acquisition boards (PCI 6052E, PCI 6703, National Instruments) and controlled by custom written software (LabView; National Instruments and Igor, Wavemetrics). With this system, it is possible to measure the force as a function of the extension of the protein (force-extension mode) or measure the elongation of the protein at a constant force (force-feedback mode; Ref. 27Oberhauser A.F. Hansma P.K. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 16: 468-472Crossref Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The spring constant of each individual cantilever (MLCT-AUHW: silicon nitride gold-coated cantilevers; Veeco Metrology Group, Santa Barbara, CA) was calculated using the equipartition theorem (28Florin E.L. Rief M. Lehmann H. Ludwig M. Dornmair C. Moy V.T. Gaub H.E. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1995; 10: 895-901Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Cantilever spring constant varied between 20-80 pN/nm. Unless noted, the pulling speed of the different force extension curves was in the range of 0.5-0.7 nm/ms.Single Protein Mechanics—In a typical experiment, a small aliquot of the purified proteins (∼1-50 μl, 10 μg/ml) was allowed to adsorb to clean glass coverslips (for ∼10 min) and then rinsed with PBS, pH 7.4 (no DTT). We found that PC1 proteins molecules adsorbed well to glass, mica, or gold-coated glass coverslips. We obtained identical data with these different substrates. However, almost all the experiments reported here were done on clean glass coverslips. The glass coverslips were cleaned by sonication in acetone for 20 min following by boiling then for 10 min in 3 n KOH and then 30% H2O2. Between each step, the coverslips were rinsed and sonicated with MilliQ water (>18.2 megohm × cm). Before use, the coverslips were dried in a stream of clean N2 gas. Segments of a protein were picked up randomly by adsorption to the cantilever tip. The probability of picking up a protein was typically kept low (less than one in 50 attempts) by controlling the amount of protein used to prepare the coverslips.Analysis of Force Extension Curves—The elasticity of the stretched proteins were analyzed using the worm-like chain (WLC) model of polymer elasticity (29Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Macromolecules. 1995; 28: 8759-8770Crossref Scopus (1981) Google Scholar) shown in Equation 1, FX=KBT/p×0.25×1−x/LC−2−0.25+x/LC(Eq. 1) where F is force, p is the persistence length, x is end-to-end length, Lc is the contour length of the stretched protein. The adjustable parameters are the persistence length, p, and the contour length, Lc.RESULTSMechanical Properties of the Native Extracellular Region of Human PC1—As a first step in characterizing the mechanical properties of PC1, we have performed single molecule experiments with its native N-terminal extracellular region. For this purpose, we generated the construct, AF20-Fc, expressing the complete N-terminal extracellular region with the adjacent GPS domain of human PC1 (3,048 amino acids), fused with Fc of human IgG1 at the C terminus (Fig. 1). The construct was expressed in a human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK293. The recombinant protein was secreted into culture medium and was purified from it using G-protein agarose for our study. The protein was completely cleaved at the GPS domain by appearance of the C-terminal Fc-stalk fragment by anti-Fc (whereas a point mutation at the critical residue of the cleavage site T3049V or T3049R disrupted the cleavage (not shown). As in the case of full-length PC1 molecule (30Qian F. Boletta A. Bhunia A.K. Xu H. Liu L. Ahrabi A.K. Watnick T.J. Zhou F. Germino G.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16981-16986Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) the N-terminal fragment (NTF) is tethered to the Fc-stalk, as demonstrated by anti-LRR, an antibody against the N-terminal LRR domain present in the NTF. Our sample therefore represents the native full-length PC1 ectodomain. To study its mechanical properties, we used a home-built single molecule atomic force microscope (17Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 31: 433-447Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 19Fisher T.E. Oberhauser A.F. Carrion-Vazquez M. Marszalek P.E.

In a typical experiment, a small aliquot of the purified N-terminal region was allowed to adsorb to a clean glass coverslip (for ∼10 min) and then rinsed with PBS pH 7.4. Segments of the PC1 ectodomain are then picked up randomly by adsorption to the cantilever tip, by pressing it down onto the sample for 1-2 s at forces of several nanoNewtons, and stretched for several hundred nanometers.Fig. 2A shows several examples of force-extension curves obtained after pulling random stretches of the PC1 ectodomain. These traces show regularly spaced force peaks, sawtooth patterns, with a wide range of peak forces and a mean of 107 ± 58 pN (n = 193 force peaks; range: ∼50-200 pN; Fig. 2B). The first 20-50 nm of these force extension curves displays several peaks that are irregular in amplitude and spacing; these events occur randomly in the force-extension curves probably because of nonspecific interactions, and were not further analyzed in the study.FIGURE 2Force-extension relationships of native full-length PC1 extracellular region. A, several examples of force-extension curves obtained after stretching AF20-Fc proteins. To analyze the spacing between peaks in the sawtooth patterns we used the WLC model. The lines were generated using a persistence length of 0.4 nm and contour length increments of 29 nm. B, histogram of force peaks shows a wide range of unfolding forces (mean force peak value: 107 ± 58 pN, n = 193 peaks). C, histogram of contour length increments observed upon unfolding; there is one main peak centered at ∼28 nm (Gaussian fit: 27.8 ± 3.3 nm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To analyze the spacing between peaks in the sawtooth patterns we used the WLC model for polymer elasticity, which predicts the entropic restoring force (F) generated upon the extension (x) of a polymer (29Marko J.F. Siggia E.D. Macromolecules. 1995; 28: 8759-8770Crossref Scopus (1981) Google Scholar; see “Materials and Methods”). The thin lines in Fig. 2A correspond to fits of the WLC equation to the curve that precedes each force peak. We found that the separation between force peaks is 27.8 ± 3.3 nm (n = 102 force peaks; Fig. 2C). This value corresponds very well with the expected increase in contour length of a 90 amino acid PKD domain: 90 amino acids × 0.35 nm (length of an amino acids) - 4 nm (size of folded PKD domain, Ref. 31Bycroft M. Bateman A. Clarke J. Hamill S.J. Sandford R. Thomas R.L. Chothia C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) = 27.5 nm. In addition, these sawtooth patterns are very similar to those found for other modular protein containing tandem Ig-like domains, such as native titin (15Rief M. Gautel M. Oesterhelt F.

Biol. 2002; 31: 433-447Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar), and recombinant PKD constructs (24Forman J.R. Qamar S. Paci E. Sandford R.N. Clarke J. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 349: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Hence, these sawtooth patterns most likely correspond to the sequential unfolding of PKD domains. So far the largest number of force peaks that we have seen is twelve, less than the total number of PKD domains, 16. This could be simply because of the random nature of the attachment of the protein to the cantilever tip making the likelihood of picking up a full-length protein very low. Alternatively, it is possible that some of the PKD domains have a low mechanical stability, and thus the unfolding forces will be below the resolution limit of our instrument (∼10 pN).In summary, our data show that the native extracellular region of PC1 is highly extensible and that this extensibility results from the unfolding of mechanically stable structural folds such as PKD domains. However, based on these data we cannot exclude the possibility that other regions, such as the REJ region, may also contribute to the extensibility and unfolding patterns.The Unfolding of PC1 Extracellular Domains Is Reversible—To test whether PC1 extracellular domains refold after mechanical unfolding, we repeatedly stretched and relaxed the PC1 extracellular region. Fig. 3 shows an experiment in which a single molecule remained attached to the AFM tip allowing for repeated extension and relaxation cycles (up to 15 cycles in this experiment over a period of ∼3 min). After each extension, the molecule was allowed to relax completely (the relaxation traces is shown in gray, Fig. 3A, trace i). To measure the refolding kinetics, we used a double pulse protocol in which the pulse interval was varied (17Oberhauser A.F. Badilla-Fernandez C. Carrion-Vazquez M. Fernandez J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 31: 433-447Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 22Oberhauser A.F. Marszalek P.E. Erickson H.P. Fernandez J.M.

Using size-exclusion chromatography we have studied the capacities of a variety of heparin oligosaccharides to bind FGF1 and FGFR2c both separately and together in ternary complexes. In the absence of heparin, FGF1 had no detectable affinity for FGFR2c. However, 2:2:1 complexes formed spontaneously in solution between FGF1, FGFR2c, and heparin octasaccharide (dp8). The dp8 sample was the shortest chain length that bound FGFR2c, that dimerized FGF1, and that promoted a strong mitogenic response to FGF1 through FGFR2c. Heparin hexasaccharide and various selectively desulfated heparin dp12s failed to bind FGFR2c and could only interact with FGF1 monomerically. These saccharides formed 1:1:1 complexes with FGF1 and FGFR2c, which had no tendency to self-associate, suggesting that binding of two FGF1 molecules to the same saccharide chain is a prerequisite for subsequent FGFR2c dimerization. We found that FGF1 dimerization upon heparin was favored over monomeric interactions even when a large excess of saccharide was present.

Itoh N. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (REVIEWS): 3005Crossref Google Scholar). The FGFs are of fundamental importance during embryogenesis where they orchestrate the complex processes of organ formation and limb development (2Coumoul X. Deng C.X. Birth Defects Res. C Embryo Today. 2003; 69: 286-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Dysregulated FGF expression is often associated with malignant transformation, because it facilitates the growth, survival, and metastatic spread of cancer cells (3Jeffers M. LaRochelle W.J. Lichenstein H.S. Expert Opin. Ther. Targets. 2002; 6: 469-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In humans 22 members of the FGF family have been described along with 4 FGF receptor tyrosine kinases (FGFR1-4). FGF signal transduction is achieved through ligand-dependent dimerization of FGFR subunits and their subsequent activation through transphosphorylation (4Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor 2-aminoacridone 2-O-desulfated (heparin) partially 6-O-desulfated (heparin) N-desulfated/N-reacetylated (heparin) degree of polymerization (equal to the number of monosaccharide units) glycosaminoglycan β-d-glucuronate α-d-N-acetylglucosamine α-d-N-sulfoglucosamine GlcNAc or GlcNS heparan sulfate α-l-iduronate immunoglobulin Stokes radius high-performance liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatography. fibroblast growth factor FGF receptor 2-aminoacridone 2-O-desulfated (heparin) partially 6-O-desulfated (heparin) N-desulfated/N-reacetylated (heparin) degree of polymerization (equal to the number of monosaccharide units) glycosaminoglycan β-d-glucuronate α-d-N-acetylglucosamine α-d-N-sulfoglucosamine GlcNAc or GlcNS heparan sulfate α-l-iduronate immunoglobulin Stokes radius high-performance liquid chromatography size-exclusion chromatography. The FGFRs share a number of common structural features (5Givol D. Yayon A. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 3362-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). All have an intracellular split tyrosine kinase domain, a transmembrane sequence, and an extracellular region composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains (D1-D3). FGF binding is mediated by the D2 and D3 domains, with the D3 domain having the primary influence on ligand specificity (6Yeh B.K. Igarashi M. Eliseenkova A.V. Plotnikov A.N. Sher I. Ron D. Aaronson S.A. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2266-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 7Plotnikov A.N. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Cell. 2000; 101: 413-424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The D1 domain of the FGFRs does not take part in ligand interactions, and engineered receptors that lack this domain bind FGFs at least as strongly as full-length forms (8Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Raucci A. Zhang F. Eliseenkova A.V. Yayon A. Basilico C. Linhardt R.J. Schlessinger J. Mohammadi M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 935-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). For FGFRs1-3, alternative splicing of the D3 domain gives rise to two variants (termed IIIb and IIIc) with different ligand specificities (9Yayon A. Zimmer Y. Shen G.H. Avivi A. Yarden Y. Givol D. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore seven distinct FGF receptors can be expressed on the cell surface, each of which binds specifically to a subset of the FGFs. Significant redundancy is present within this system, because each receptor can be activated by several different FGFs. The FGFs themselves are also not limited to a single FGFR type, for example FGF1 (acidic FGF) is a universal ligand, recognized by all FGF receptors (10Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S. McEwen D.G. MacArthur C.A. Coulier F. Gao G. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15292-15297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). On the other hand, FGF7 (keratinocyte growth factor) is only capable of binding FGFR2b (11Sher I. Yeh B.K. Mohammadi M. Adir N. Ron D. FEBS Lett. 2003; 552: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The D2 domain of the FGFRs contains a short stretch of basic amino acids referred to as the K18K loop (12Kan M. Wang F. Xu J. Crabb J.W. Hou J. McKeehan W.L. Science. 1993; 259: 1918-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). This region mediates interaction with heparin and HS (13Powell A.K. Fernig D.G. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28554-28563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and is essential for receptor function. The FGFs are also heparin-binding proteins, and it is now appreciated that signal transduction requires the formation of a ternary complex at the cell surface formed between FGF, FGFR, and heparan sulfate (HS). Heparin and HS are two structurally and functionally related glycosaminoglycans (GAGs (14Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Casu B. Lindahl U. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 2001; 57: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 16Rabenstein D.L. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2002; 19: 312-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar)). HS is expressed on core proteins in the extracellular matrix and on the surface of almost all mammalian cell types. In contrast, heparin is produced by mast cells where it is stored in granules for release as free chains. Biosynthesis occurs in the Golgi apparatus with the same enzymes involved for both GAGs (17Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). The saccharides are synthesized as 1→4 linked polymers of β-d-glucuronate (GlcA) and α-d-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). During chain elongation, enzymes substitute acetyl groups for sulfates to create α-d-N-sulfoglucosamine (GlcNS) residues (18Kjellen L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Regions of N-sulfation are then acted on by a variety of enzymes, which catalyze further modification steps, most commonly the epimerization of GlcA to α-l-iduronate (IdoA), 2-O-sulfation of IdoA residues and 6-O-sulfation of GlcNAc/GlcNS (collectively, GlcNR). A key feature of heparin/HS synthesis is that not all available substrate sites are acted upon by each enzyme, resulting in a significant degree of structural heterogeneity (17Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). During HS synthesis an unknown mechanism targets the modification steps to discrete regions of the polysaccharide chain. This creates a domain organization where sulfated and unmodified regions of roughly equal length (14-18 disaccharides) alternate in a relatively uniform pattern along the HS chain (19Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Within the sulfated regions are stretches of IdoA(2S)-GlcNS with varying patterns of 6-O-sulfation (S-domains, 2-7 disaccharides long (20Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)), which are flanked by stretches of alternating N-sulfated and N-acetylated disaccharides with highly variable patterns of O-sulfation (19Murphy K.J. Merry C.L. Lyon M. Thompson J.E. Roberts I.S. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27239-27245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast to HS, heparin chains are shorter and highly sulfated throughout. Heparin saccharides can be likened to the S-domains regions of HS, and the relative ease with which they can be prepared means that heparin is often used experimentally as a substitute for HS. The heterogeneity of sulfation present in HS, and to a lesser extent heparin, is key to their functions, because distinct patterns of sulfation define binding sites for specific protein ligands (14Gallagher J.T. J. Clin. Invest. 2001; 108: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Variations in the distribution of basic amino acids upon the surface of the FGFs lead to markedly different heparin-binding properties (21Raman R. Venkataraman G. Ernst S. Sasisekharan V. Sasisekharan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2357-2362Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). FGF2 (basic FGF) will bind to heparin/HS pentasaccharides (dp5) that are devoid of 6-O-sulfate groups as long as they contain one or more critically positioned N- and 2-O-sulfates (22Maccarana M. Casu B. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23898-23905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, FGF1 binding to heparin/HS oligosaccharides is thought to require N-, 2-O-, and 6-O-sulfation (23Kreuger J. Prydz K. Pettersson R.F. Lindahl U. Salmivirta M. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 723-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Heparin adopts a helical secondary structure in solution, leading to the sulfate groups of contiguous disaccharide units alternating between opposite sides of the helical axis (24Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). This conformation allows protein ligands to dimerize through interactions with opposite faces of the same short saccharide sequence. Crystal structures of 2:1 complexes formed between FGF1 and heparin dp10 show this trans binding arrangement (25DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Whether FGF dimerization can occur in vivo on HS chains has important implications for how ternary complexes form and what stoichiometry these complexes adopt. Two crystal structures of FGF·FGFR·heparin ternary complexes have been published. Schlessinger, Mohammadi, and colleagues (26Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) describe a putative 2:2:2 complex formed between FGF2, FGFR1c, and heparin dp10. In each half of this structure a heparin chain bound both FGF2 and FGFR1c, augmenting the ligand-receptor interaction. The two 1:1:1 complexes were then held together through direct FGFR1c-FGFR1c contacts, as well as secondary FGF2-FGFR1c and heparin-FGFR1c interactions. In contrast, Pellegrini et al. (27Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) identified a possible 2:2:1 FGF1·FGFR2c·heparin dp10 structure in which a single heparin chain bridged the gap between two FGF1·FGFR2c complexes, making additional contacts with one of the receptor subunits. The two ternary complex architectures place differing limitations on where they can form upon HS chains (28Pellegrini L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Steric hindrance would only allow the 2:2:2 structure (26Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar) to form between FGF·FGFR complexes on the very end of separate HS chains. In contrast, the heparin-bridged 2:2:1 complex (27Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) could form internally upon a HS chain but, because the two FGF·FGFR half-complexes do not interact directly, they are reliant on the probability that they become aligned upon opposite faces of the same short stretch of HS. A recent study using both analytical ultracentrifugation and mass spectrometry suggests that, in solution, 2:2:1 ternary complexes can be formed in which the FGF·FGFR subunits are arranged in either a Pellegrinior Schlessinger/Mohammadi-like architecture (29Harmer N.J. Ilag L.L. Mulloy B. Pellegrini L. Robinson C.V. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 339: 821-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expanding on these studies, we have used a variety of heparin fragments in a size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) system to investigate the role that heparin plays in the assembly of FGF1·FGFR2c complexes. Materials—Full-length human FGF1 and the ectodomain of human FGFR2c (residues 148-366, encompassing the immunoglobulin-like domains D2 and D3) were prepared separately as described (27Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Sizedefined oligosaccharides were prepared from untreated and selectively desulfated heparin samples (30Lyon M. Rushton G. Askari J.A. Humphries M.J. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4599-4606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) by high resolution SEC of partial heparinase digests (31Ostrovsky O. Berman B. Gallagher J. Mulloy B. Fernig D.G. Delehedde M. Ron D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2444-2453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Fluorescence end-labeling of heparin dp12 with 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) was carried out as described (32Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Lietha D. Gherardi E. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43560-43567Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Heparinase I (Flavobacterium heparinum, EC 4.2.2.7), heparinase II (F. heparinum, no EC number assigned), and heparinase III (F. heparinum, EC 4.2.2.8) were purchased from Grampian Enzymes (Orkney, UK). Blue dextran 2000 was from Amersham Biosciences (Little Chalfont, UK) and sodium dichromate was from Sigma-Aldrich. All solutions were prepared using MilliQ (Millipore, Watford, UK) ultrapure water. HiPerSolv grade NaCl was from BDH-Merck Ltd. (Lutterworth, UK), whereas Ultra grade HEPES was from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents were from BDH-Merck Ltd. High Performance SEC—A Hewlett Packard 1100 Series High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system was used to equilibrate a prepacked Superdex 200 HR column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) at 0.5 ml/min in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2). The same column and HPLC system were used for all runs. Proteins and/or heparin fragments were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature in 240 μl of column running buffer prior to column loading. These samples were then eluted isocratically at 0.5 ml/min, and the absorbance at 280 nm (aromatic amino acid side chains) or 232 nm (unsaturated bonds of heparin fragments) was recorded. The elution of AMAC-labeled heparin dp12 was monitored by fluorescence detection (excitation max., 425 nm; emission max., 520 nm). All elution profiles shown are representative of at least two repeats. The Superdex 200 column was calibrated using gel filtration HMW and LMW protein calibration kits (Amersham Biosciences). The column void (Vo) and total (Vt) volumes were determined using blue dextran 2000 and sodium dichromate, respectively. The elution volumes (Ve) of protein standards were converted in to a calibration chart of Kav against molecular mass [Kav = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo)]. A line of best fit was fitted to the calibration data using Microsoft Excel, and the equation of this line was used to estimate mass according to observed Kav. We also plotted the square root of -log10(Kav) against the Stokes radius for the protein standards. The equation for the line of best fit on this chart was used to calculate the Stokes radius of eluted species. Disaccharide Composition Analysis of Heparin Oligosaccharides—Heparin saccharides (200 μg) were suspended in heparinase buffer (50 mm NaAc, 0.5 mm CaAc2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0). Aliquots of heparinases I, II, and III were added to a concentration of 100 mIU/ml, and digests were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Disaccharides were purified from the heparin digests using a Superdex peptide column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Biosciences) running at 0.5 ml/min in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, while monitoring the absorbance of the eluate at 232 nm. Heparin disaccharides were then repeatedly lyophilized to remove NH4HCO3 until their conductivity in 1 ml of dH2O, pH 3.5, was <200 μS. A single ProPac PA-1 strong anion-exchange HPLC column (4.6 × 250 mm, Dionex, Camberley, UK) was linked to a Hewlett Packard 1100 series high-performance chromatography system. The column was run at a flow rate of 1 ml/min in MilliQ ultrapure water, pH 3.5. Lyophilized disaccharides were resuspended in 1 ml of this buffer and loaded onto the column prior to the application of the gradient (45 min, 0-1.0 m NaCl). The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 232 nm, and peaks were identified by comparison to heparin disaccharide standards. Mitogenesis Assay—BaF-32 cells are a lymphoblastoid cell line deficient for HS synthesis (33Ornitz D.M. Yayon A. Flanagan J.G. Svahn C.M. Levi E. Leder P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 240-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). These cells have no endogenous expression of the FGFs or FGFRs, but were transfected with FGFR2c. FGF1-stimulated proliferation of the transfected cells required the addition of HS or heparin saccharides to the culture medium. BaF-32 cells were routinely maintained in interleukin-3-conditioned medium as described before (34Pye D.A. Vives R.R. Turnbull J.E. Hyde P. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22936-22942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). For the mitogenesis assay, cells were serum-starved for 2 days, washed 3 times in phosphate-buffered saline then seeded at a low density (2.5 × 105 cells/ml) onto a 96-well plate in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum. Cells were incubated for 4 days at 37 °C in medium containing FGF1 (100 ng/ml) and sized heparin oligosaccharides (0.1-2.0 μg/ml) or porcine mucosal HS (10 μg/ml). The CytoLite™ kit (Packard BioScience) was used as a chemiluminometric assay of viable cell number. Size-exclusion Chromatography of FGF1, FGFR2c, and Heparin dp12—In this study we applied the technique to investigate the formation in solution of ternary complexes between FGF1, FGFR2c, and heparin. A Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column was connected to an HPLC system and equilibrated in a buffer of physiological ionic strength. A range of protein standards were used to calibrate the column so that the Stokes radius (RS) and apparent mass could be determined from the Kav values of eluted species (see “Experimental Procedures”). Human FGF1, the ligand-binding domain (D2-D3) of human FGFR2c, and a heparin dodecasaccharide sample were then applied separately to the calibrated column (Fig. 1). FGF1 eluted with a peak at 36.1 min, which corresponds to an apparent mass of 16 kDa, very close to its known mass of 15.8 kDa. FGF1 has a compact globular structure (35Zhu X. Komiya H. Chirino A. Faham S. Fox G.M. Arakawa T. Hsu B.T. Rees D.C. Science. 1991; 251: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) and therefore eluted close to its predicted Kav value on the calibrated column. The ectodomain of FGFR2c had an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa, larger than its actual mass of 24.5 kDa. The receptor protein consists of two contiguous Ig-like motifs rather than a single globular domain (27Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and this was reflected in a larger than expected hydrodynamic volume. Our FGFR2c protein was purified from a bacterial expression system (27Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) and was therefore non-glycosylated. Glycosylation may have an important role in FGFR activity in vivo (36Winterpacht A. Hilbert K. Stelzer C. Schweikardt T. Decker H. Segerer H. Spranger J. Zabel B. Physiol. Genomics. 2000; 2: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but does not appear to affect FGF-binding ability (37Tuominen H. Heikinheimo P. Loo B.M. Kataja K. Oker-Blom C. Uutela M. Jalkanen M. Goldman A. Protein Expr. Purif. 2001; 21: 275-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 38Bergonzoni L. Caccia P. Cletini O. Sarmientos P. Isacchi A. Eur. J.

Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar) used Escherichia coli-expressed FGFR proteins, and therefore the lack of glycosylation should not bias the formation of ternary complexes with a particular stoichiometry. The fully sulfated heparin 12-mer (dp12) had a molecular mass of just 3.44 kDa; however, this oligosaccharide adopts a rigid helical structure in solution (24Mulloy B. Forster M.J. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 1147-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), which resulted in a large observed Stokes radius (21 Å). When run on a Superdex 200 column calibrated with protein standards, the dp12 sample had an apparent molecular mass of 22 kDa.

Protein elution could be followed by absorbance at 280 nm. However, proteins also absorb strongly at 232 nm; therefore, the heparin component could not be monitored at this wavelength. We investigated the use of 2-aminoacridone (AMAC) as a fluorescent tag for the reducing end of our heparin dodecasaccharide. This allowed us to monitor simultaneously the elution of protein (absorbance at 280 nm) and saccharide (fluorescence) from the Superdex 200 column. The presence of the AMAC-tag had no significant effect on the elution position of the FGF1·dp12 and FGF1·F-GFR2c·dp12 complexes observed. The sensitivity of this approach also allowed us to detect the same complexes at concentrations below that which protein absorbance could be monitored (<200 pmol, data not shown). SEC with fluorescent end labeling of saccharides could be used in future studies to investigate protein·heparin complex formation at physiologically relevant concentration levels. A 2:1 incubation of FGF1 and AMAC-dp12 led to the formation of a single complex (RS = 32.6 Å) in which all of the FGF1 and saccharide was present (Fig. 2A). The crystal structure of a 2:1 FGF1·dp10 complex has been previously published (25DiGabriele A.D. Lax I. Chen D.I. Svahn C.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 812-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and has a predicted hydrodynamic radius of 29.1 Å (using the program Crysol (39Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2776) Google Scholar)). These data indicate that the observed FGF1·dp12 complex has a 2:1 stoichiometry. Such a complex would have a mass of 35 kDa, however, the apparent mass of the peak calculated from the calibration data was 57 kDa. This could be explained by the large apparent mass of the heparin dp12. The sum of the apparent masses of the components in the 2:1 complex was 55 kDa (16 + 16 + 22 kDa). Using SEC we failed to detect any interaction between FGF1 and FGFR2c in the absence of heparin (Fig. 2B). However, when these two proteins were incubated in a 2:2:1 ratio with heparin dp12, a single major peak was observed with a much earlier elution position. All of the AMAC-tagged dp12 was present within this complex indicating that a 2:2:1 complex was formed. The Stokes radius of this ternary complex (41.4 Å, using heparin dp12) was also closer to that predicted from the crystal structure of the 2:2:1 Pellegrini complex (40.9 Å, dp10), than that of the 2:2:2 Schlessinger/Mohammadi complex (37.7 Å, dp10, calculated using Crysol (39Svergun D. Barberato C. Koch M.H.J J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1995; 28: 768-773Crossref Scopus (2776) Google Scholar)). An apparent mass of 113 kDa was calculated for the ternary complex. The discrepancy between this mass and the predicted 122-kDa apparent mass of a 2:2:1 FGF1·FGFR2c·dp12 complex is likely to be a consequence of the reduced hydrodynamic volume of the components when they are brought closely t"
https://openalex.org/W2049446884,"The yeast transcriptional regulator Yap1p is a key determinant in oxidative stress resistance. This protein is found in the cytoplasm under non-stressed conditions but rapidly accumulates in the nucleus following oxidant exposure. There it activates transcription of genes encoding antioxidants that return the redox balance of the cell to an acceptable range. Yap1p localization to the nucleus requires the oxidant-specific formation of disulfide bonds in the N-terminal cysteine-rich domain (N-CRD) and/or the C-terminal cysteine-rich domain (C-CRD). H2O2 exposure triggers the formation of two interdomain disulfide bonds between the N-and C-CRDs. This dually disulfide-bonded structure has been argued to mask the nuclear export signal in the C-CRD that would otherwise prevent Yap1p nuclear accumulation. The C-CRD is required for wild-type H2O2 tolerance but dispensable for resistance to diamide. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae TRX2 gene, encoding a thioredoxin protein, cannot be induced by H2O2 in the presence of various mutant forms of Yap1p lacking the normally functioning C-CRD. In this work, we demonstrate that the proper folding of Yap1p in the presence of H2O2 is required for recruitment of the mediator component Rox3p to the TRX2 promoter in addition to the nuclear accumulation of Yap1p during stress by this oxidant.

Cells must detoxify reactive oxygen species that are formed during aerobic metabolism to maintain viability (1Cadenas E. Annu. Rev.

Sensing the resulting changes in the oxidative environment is an essential ability enabling proper regulatory adjustment of the multiple systems that control the intracellular redox potential. Utilization of the uniquely oxidant-sensitive cysteine residue in proteins has emerged as a pervasive theme in proteins that have been designed to monitor the redox milieu (3Paget M.S. Buttner M.J. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2003; 37: 91-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The Saccharomyces cerevisiae transcriptional regulatory protein Yap1p has provided important insight into the mechanism of oxidative stress sensing in eukaryotic cells via changes in the redox status of its cysteine residues (see Refs. 3Paget M.S.

Rorigues-Pousada C. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6982-6993Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In the absence of oxidative challenge, Yap1p resides in a cytoplasmic location (10Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). However, upon stress by addition of oxidants like diamide and H2O2, nuclear export of Yap1p is inhibited (11Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7416-7429Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Kuge S. Toda T. Iizuka N. Nomoto A. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), and the factor rapidly accumulates in the nucleus, where it induces the expression of genes that often encode antioxidant proteins (10Kuge S.

Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This oxidant-regulated nuclear localization has been the focus of much research, and important details have emerged illuminating the molecular mechanism. Yap1p contains two clusters of cysteine residues called cysteine-rich domains located at the N terminus (N-CRD) and the C terminus (C-CRD). These N- and C-CRDs provide all the cysteine residues found in the Yap1p sequence, and control of their redox status is crucial for control of Yap1p activity by oxidative stress. Previous work established that deletion of the C-CRD leads to Yap1p being constitutively located in the nucleus with transcription of an artificial Yap1p-responsive reporter plasmid and diamide tolerance being constitutively elevated (10Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 14Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Interestingly, although elimination of the C-CRD leads to diamide hyper-resistance, H2O2 tolerance is lowered relative to wild-type Yap1p (14Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

Important characterization of this oxidant-selective behavior of Yap1p was provided by the biochemical analysis of Yap1p after diamide and H2O2 exposure. Diamide challenge produces disulfide bonds that appear to form in either the N- or C-CRD (15Kuge S. Arita M. Murayama A. Maeta K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. Nomoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6139-6150Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), whereas H2O2 stress induces the formation of a disulfide bond between the N- and C-CRDs (16Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of cysteine residues in the N- and C-CRDs indicated that Cys303 and Cys598 are required for both normal H2O2 resistance and disulfide bond formation, but these same residues are dispensable for diamide tolerance (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). More recent experiments have demonstrated that two disulfide bonds are formed between residues in the N- and C-CRDs (17Wood M.J. Storz G. Tjandra N. Nature. 2004; 430: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) in response to H2O2 but not diamide. The oxidant-specific defects of Yap1p mutants have been linked to specific defects in the program of Yap1p-dependent gene activation (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin-encoding TRX2 gene is a Yap1p regulatory target that is required for normal H2O2 resistance (7Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Yap1p mutants that cannot form the interdomain disulfide bond between the N- and C-CRDs are unable to elevate TRX2 expression in the presence of H2O2 (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 16Delaunay A. Isnard A.D. Toledano M.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5157-5166Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Experiments using fragments of the TRX2 promoter placed upstream of a CYC1-lacZ fusion gene indicated that TRX2 promoter sequences from positions -141 to -61 prevent overexpression of β-galactosidase activity in response to the presence of a constitutively nuclear Yap1p mutant (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We have determined that the element blocking high-level CYC1-lacZ activation in this TRX2-CYC1-lacZ reporter corresponds to the TRX2 TATA box. Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies have indicated that the mediator component Rox3p is preferentially recruited to the TRX2 promoter during H2O2 stress. Yap1p mutants unable to form the N- and C-CRD interdomain disulfide bonds fail either to recruit Rox3p to TRX2 or to activate expression of this gene in the face of H2O2 challenge. This problem is seen even in a C-CRD mutant that is constitutively located in the nucleus. Together, these data argue that formation of properly disulfide-bonded Yap1p during H2O2 stress is required to generate a new bifunctional protein domain that allows Yap1p to accumulate in the nucleus as well as to recruit Rox3p to TRX2. Yeast Strains and Media—The yeast strains used in this study were as follows: SEY6210 (MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel-), SM13 (MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel- yap1-Δ2::hisG), and YSC21 (MATα leu2-3,112 ura3-52 his3-Δ200 trp1-Δ901 lys2-801 suc2-Δ9 Mel- trx2Δ::LEU2). YSC21 was generated by PCR amplification of the trx2Δ::LEU2 allele from EMY62 (provided by Dr. Eric Muller, University of Washington) (18Muller E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9194-9202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and transformation of yeast strain SEY6210 with the resulting product. Leu+ transformants were recovered and purified. Genomic DNA was recovered from Leu+ cells, and the genome was analyzed for proper disruption of TRX2 by Southern blotting. The S. cerevisiae cells were grown in rich medium (YPD, 2% yeast extract/1% peptone/2% dextrose), minimal medium, or complete minimal medium supplemented with amino acids, adenine, and uracil as described (19Sherman F. Fink G. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1979Google Scholar). Transformation was performed using the LiOAc technique (20Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays for β-galactosidase activity were carried out on permeabilized cells as described (21Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar). H2O2 resistance assays were carried out by spot test (22Wu A.-L. Wemmie J.A. Edgington N.P. Goebl M. Guevara J.L. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18850-18858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids—Low-copy-number URA3-containing plasmids carrying the wild-type or C629A YAP1 gene have been described (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23Wemmie J.A. Wu A.-L. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol.

LEU2 variants of wild-type and C629A YAP1 were generated by moving a SacI/HindIII fragment from pSM58wt or pC629A into SacI/HindIII-cut pRS315 (pSMS51 and pRS315-C629A respectively). The TRX2- (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and GSH1-lacZ (8Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reporter plasmids have been described previously. A low-copy-number plasmid (pSC-T1) bearing the wild-type TRX2 coding region containing a BamHI site introduced after the translation start site was generated by PCR. Wild-type or mutant YRE forms of the TRX2 promoter were generated by PCR and fused to the TRX2 open reading frame (pSC-T1) or lacZ reporter plasmids (pSEYC102) (24Emr S.D. Vassarotti A. Garret J. Geller B.C. Takeda M. Douglas M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The primer used to alter the -218 YRE (GTT TAT ACT Cga gGT AAA GGA TGC TCC) introduced an XhoI site to facilitate identification. (The nucleotides changed are indicated by lowercase letters, and the restriction enzyme site introduced is underlined) The primer used to introduce changes into the -181 YRE (CTG AAC GCG tcT Aga AAG AAA AGA GCC) incorporated an XbaI site to ease identification. The mutant promoters were moved into the context of pSC-T1 or pSEYC102 as EcoRI/BamHI fragments. The 3′-deletion series was created by PCR amplification of a portion of the TRX2 promoter and were then placed upstream of the CYC1 promoter lacking its upstream activating sequence (UAS) and fused to lacZ. The forward primer for all plasmids in this series anneals at 237 bp upstream of the translation start site. Its sequence is GCG GAT CCA TGT GTA ATT GTT TAT ACT C. For the -120 deletion mutant, the reverse primer was CCG AGA TCT ATG GCT TTC TTA TAT ACT GAT. The -104 deletion mutant was created with the reverse primer CCG AGA TCT CTT TTC ATC CCC CGA ATG GCT T. For the -90 deletion mutant, the reverse primer was CCG AGA TCT TTA TTC TCT TGT CAG CTT TTC. These fragments were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and digested with EcoRI and BglII, and the TRX2 segments were inserted into EcoRI/BamHI-cut p314-CLZ as described (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The -155 and -61 deletion mutants have been described (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A 240-bp fragment of the TRX2 promoter containing a mutant TATA box (pSAR28) was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis and cloned into the pCR2.1-TOPO cloning vector. The primer used to mutate the site was GAA AGA GGG ATA TCA GtC GAC AAG AAA GCC ATC GG to create pSAR28, which was then cleaved with EcoRI and BamHI; and the 240-bp fragment was moved into the pSEYC102 plasmid to create a lacZ fusion (pSAR29). A second 240-bp fragment was generated that would replace the TRX2 TATA box with the TRP5 TATA box. This fragment was ligated into pSEYC102 to create a lacZ fusion (pSAR31). The primer used to produce this mutant was GAA AGA GGG ATA TCA GTA TAA GAA AAA GCC ATT CGG. All PCR products were sequenced to ensure that no errors had occurred during amplification. DNase I Footprinting—PCR products of the TRX2 promoter containing either wild-type or mutant YREs were amplified using primers -296-TRX2-For (GAT GGA TCC AAG ATC AGC ATA ACT TG) and TRX2-BglII-Rev (CCG AGA TCT TAT TGA TGT GTT ATT TAA AG) and cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. These plasmids were digested with BamHI, treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and finally cleaved with EcoRI. The appropriate labeled fragments were isolated from an agarose gel using a Qiagen mini-elute column. DNase I protection was performed using bacterially expressed Yap1p as reported previously (25Moye-Rowley W.S. Harshman K.D. Parker C.S. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—For the TATA box-binding protein Tbp1p, a 237-bp segment of the wild-type TRX2 promoter was amplified using primers -236-TRX2-For (TGCGGATTCATGTGTAATTGTTTATAC) and TRX2-BglII-Rev. The resulting PCR fragment was cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO. A 5′-end-labeled fragment was prepared as described above for the DNase I probes. The labeled fragment was isolated and incubated with bacterially produced Tbp1p (provided by Dr. Anthony Weil, Vanderbilt University). In some cases, unlabeled competitor DNAs were included in the binding reaction to verify binding specificity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed basically as described (26Kang J.J. Auble D.T. Ranish J.A. Hahn S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1234-1243Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding was carried out in 4% glycerol, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 20 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) for 45 min at 30 °C. DNA and protein·DNA complexes were resolved by electrophoresis on a 4% native acrylamide gel at 4 °C using 1× buffer containing 45 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 45 mm boric acid, and 1 mm EDTA. The gel was dried and visualized by autoradiography. Primer Extension Mapping of the Transcription Start Site—RNA was isolated from yeast strains grown in YPD medium. Primer CAC TGT CGT ATT CAG AAG CG was first end-labeled with 32P and then mixed with 50 μg of total RNA. This mixture was ethanol-precipitated, and nucleic acids were brought up in 20 μl of annealing buffer (250 mm KCl, 10 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.2), and 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.0)) and heated to 65 °C for 45 min. This mixture was cooled to and allowed to anneal at 37 °C for 6 h. Five units of avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 5 μgof actinomycin D, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2,10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm spermidine, 5 mm each dNTP, and 40 units of RNasin were mixed and brought to a final volume of 100 μl. Reverse transcription took place at 37 °C for 1 h. The DNA·RNA complexes were treated with 30 μg of RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. The DNA was then precipitated, resuspended in stop buffer (95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA, 0.05% bromphenol blue, and 0.05% xylene cyanol), heated to 90 °C, chilled briefly, and then run at 20 watts on a 6% denaturing acrylamide gel. Sequencing reactions were performed with the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—Cells were grown in liquid medium until an A600 nm of 0.8–1.0 was reached. Formaldehyde was directly added to the culture to a final concentration of 2% to form cross-linked protein·DNA complexes. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with occasional swirling. Formaldehyde cross-links were quenched by addition of 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 250 mm. Cells were then lysed in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 140 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitors), and the chromatin was sheared by sonication (Fisher Model 550 sonic dismembrator). The sheared chromatin was then immunoprecipitated using anti-tandem affinity purification (TAP) antibody (Open Biosystems) and protein A-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). The beads were then washed with ChIP wash buffer (10 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 250 mm LiCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm EDTA), and precipitates were eluted. The eluted precipitates were incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse cross-links. DNA was then precipitated and subjected to PCR analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation—All immunoprecipitation assays were performed using lysed spheroplasts. In brief, 100 ml of cells were harvested at A600 nm = 0.8–1.0 and resuspended in Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, centrifuged, and resuspended in 10 ml of spheroplast buffer (1 m sorbitol in 0.5× YPD medium and 50 mm KPO4) with oxylyticase and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min on a shaker. After chilling on ice, cell suspensions were overlaid on a sucrose cushion (20 mm HEPES, 1.2 m sucrose, and 0.02% sodium azide) and pelleted by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 25 min at 4 °C. The resulting spheroplasts (treated and untreated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide at 30 °C for 40 min) were suspended in intracellular (lysis) buffer (100 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm KCl, 20 mm PIPES, and 200 mm sorbitol (pH 6.8)). Protein lysates were prepared by grinding the spheroplasts in the presence of glass beads, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g with recovery of the supernatant. These lysates were precleared by rotation with protein A-agarose mixture (100 μl/ml of lysate) at 4 °C for 1 h, followed by centrifugation. Precleared lysates were rotated with 4 μg of anti-TAP antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. For immunoprecipitation, 50 μl of protein A-agarose were added to samples and further rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then spun down at 10,000 × g for 2 min and washed twice with intracellular buffer. The immunoprecipitated proteins were recovered by adding Twirl buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm Tris (pH 6.8)). These precipitates were then loaded onto 12% polyacrylamide gel and probed with anti-Yap1p antibody (14Wemmie J.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7908-7914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) to detect Yap1p or with peroxidase-conjugated anti-peroxidase antibody to detect TAP-tagged Rox3p as described (27Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M. Seraphin B. Methods (Orlando). 2001; 24: 218-229Google Scholar). Aliquots of the protein lysates prior to immunoprecipitation were also electrophoresed and blotted for Yap1p to ensure that equivalent levels of Yap1p were used in the co-immunoprecipitation assays. Differential Role of the Yap1p C Terminus in Oxidative Stress Induction—The importance of the C terminus of Yap1p in the oxidant-regulated nuclear localization of this factor has been well documented (10Kuge S. Jones N. Nomoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1710-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11Yan C. Lee L.H. Davis L.I.

Previously, we demonstrated that normal function of the C-terminal region of Yap1p is crucial for H2O2-induced activation of the thioredoxin-encoding TRX2 gene but not an artificial Yap1p-responsive reporter gene (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A C-terminal mutant form of Yap1p lacking a cysteine residue in the C-CRD (C629A Yap1p) is constitutively localized to the nucleus and fails to normally induce TRX2 expression upon H2O2 challenge (13Coleman S.T. Epping E.A. Steggerda S.M. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8302-8313Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We compared the ability of this mutant Yap1p derivative to control expression of the oxidant-inducible GSH1 gene (28Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), encoding γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, the first step in glutathione biosynthesis (29Ohtake Y. Yabuuchi S. Yeast. 1991; 7: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). GSH1 transcription has been previously shown to be oxidant-responsive in a Yap1p-dependent fashion (8Wu A.-L. Moye-Rowley W.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5832-5839Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A yap1Δ mutant strain was transformed with low-copy-number plasmids expressing either wild-type or C629A Yap1p along with lacZ gene fusions to either TRX2 or GSH1. Appropriate transformants were then tested for β-galactosidase expression in the presence or absence of oxidative stress (Fig. 1). GSH1-lacZ expression was elevated by ∼2- and 3.5-fold upon oxidative stress induced by H2O2 or diamide, respectively, in the presence of wild-type Yap1p, consistent with the findings of other groups (28Stephen D.W. Rivers S.L. Jamieson D.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 30Sugiyama K. Izawa S. Inoue Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15535-15540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Expression of C629A Yap1p increased GSH1 expression by 2-fold in the absence of oxidant, and this expression failed to increase in the face of H2O2 exposure and was only modestly enhanced during diamide stress. Notably, expression of GSH1 during H2O2 treatment was identical in the presence of either wild-type or C629A Yap1p. This behavior contrasts with a TRX2-lacZ fusion gene that showed a striking expression defect in the presence of C629A Yap1p during H2O2 stress. C629A Yap1p was unable to significantly induce TRX2 upon H2O2 challenge. We believe that this selective inability to drive TRX2 expression in the presence of H2O2 is at the heart of the failure of C-terminal mutant forms of Yap1p to support normal resistance to this oxidant (13Coleman S.T.

This analysis demonstrated that the wild-type Yap1p C-CRD is required for significant induction of TRX2 but not GSH1 during H2O2-induced oxidative stress, indicating that TRX2 places a unique requirement on the C terminus of Yap1p that is not shared by all Yap1p target genes. To explore this unique demand on Yap1p at the TRX2 promoter, we characterized the structure of this promoter. YREs in TRX2—Previous work suggested the presence of two YREs in the 5′-noncoding region of TRX2 located at positions -218 and -181 upstream of the ATG codon (7Kuge S. Jones N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 655-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). A double mutant promoter lacking both of these YREs was unable to respond to Yap1p. To determine the individual contribution of these two putative YREs to Yap1p regulation of TRX2, we constructed a set of mutant TRX2 promoters lacking either one or both of the TRX2 YREs. We carried out DNase I protection analysis using bacterially produced Yap1p to determine whether both YREs were bound by Yap1p in vitro and to ensure that the mutant sites were no longer recognized by the recombinant protein (Fig. 2). The YRE at position -181 was strongly protected from DNase I cleavage by Yap1p. Only very weak interaction was detected at the -218 YRE, and the mutant YREs failed to detectably bind this factor in vitro. To assess the functional contribution of these YREs to TRX2 expression, two analyses were carried out. First, each mutant promoter was fused to lacZ to facilitate measurement of gene expression. Second, each mutant promoter was placed in the context of the wild-type TRX2 gene to evaluate the effect of removal of the YREs on the ability of the resulting constructs to complement the H2O2 sensitivity of a trx2Δ strain. Both the lacZ fusions and the TRX2 clones were returned to yeast on low-copy-number plasmids, and appropriate assays were carried out (Fig. 3). Each TRX2-lacZ fusion plasmid was introduced into either wild-type or yap1Δ cells, and β-g"

The transcriptional activity of ERα and ERβ is known to be modulated by cofactor proteins. We used a yeast two-hybrid system and identified NFAT3 as a novel ERβ-binding protein. NFAT3 interacted with ERα and ERβ both in vitro and in mammalian cells in a ligand-independent fashion. NFAT3 bound specifically to the ERβ region containing the activation function-1 domain, a ligand-independent transactivation domain. Overexpression of NFAT3 enhanced both ERα and ERβ transcriptional activities in a ligand-independent manner and up-regulated downstream estrogen-responsive genes including pS2 and cathepsin D. Reduction of endogenous NFAT3 with NFAT3 small interfering RNA or overexpression of NFAT3 deletion mutants that lack the ER-binding sites reduced the NFAT3 coactivation of ERα and ERβ. NFAT3 increased binding of ERα to the estrogen-responsive element and was recruited to endogenous estrogen-responsive promoters. NFAT3 was expressed differentially in many breast cancer cell lines and overexpressed in a subset of breast cancer patients. Knockdown of endogenous NFAT3 reduced the growth of human breast cancer ZR75-1 cells in a ligand-independent manner. Taken together, these results suggest that NFAT3 may play important roles in ER signaling and represent a novel target for breast cancer therapy.

Both of the two receptors regulate gene transcription either by binding directly to estrogen-responsive elements (ERE) located within the promoter regions of target genes or interacting with other transcription factors such as AP1 and SP1 (4Batistuzzo de Medeiros S.R.

Two distinct activation function (AF) domains contribute to the transcriptional activity of the two receptors. The first activation function AF-1, a ligand-independent transactivation domain, is located at the N terminus, whereas the second, ligand-dependent activation function, AF-2, is located at the C terminus, overlapping the ligand-binding domain. The AF-1 activity of ERβ is weak, compared with that of ERα, whereas their AF-2 activities are similar (6Cowley S.M. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). In most cases, the AF-1 and AF-2 domains interact functionally to enhance transcription in a cooperative manner. The DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the two receptors is centrally located. ERα and ERβ possess similar binding affinities for estrogen and their cognate DNA binding site, which is probably caused by the high degree of sequence homology they share in their ligand and DNA binding domains (7Gustafsson J.A. Semin. Perinatol. 2000; 24: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The ligand binding domain shows 58% homology between ERα and ERβ. The DNA binding domain is identical between the two receptors except for three amino acids. However, the N terminus containing the AF-1 domain of ERβ has only 28% homology with that of ERα. estrogen receptor 17β-estradiol estrogen-responsive element(s) activation function cAMP-response element-binding protein glutathione S-transferase 4-hydroxytamoxifen small interfering RNA reverse transcription chromatin immunoprecipitation DNA-binding domain mutant ERE glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

However, the intracellular signaling pathways modulating ER transcriptional activity are not fully elucidated. In this study, we have identified and characterized a novel ER-interacting protein, NFAT3. NFAT3 is a member of the family of NFAT transcription factors (34Hoey T. Sun Y.L. Williamson K. Xu X. Immunity. 1995; 2: 461-472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 35Rao A. Luo C. Hogan P.G. Annu. Rev.

Acta. 2000; 1498: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We show that NFAT3 interacts with ERα and ERβ in vitro and in vivo and enhances ERα- and ERβ-mediated transcriptional activity in a ligand-independent manner. NFAT3 not only is incorporated in the ERα-ERE complex but also increases binding of ERα to the ERE sequence. NFAT3 significantly increases the transcription of various downstream genes of estrogen signaling. We further demonstrate that NFAT3 is frequently up-regulated in a subset of human breast tumors, and knockdown of endogenous NFAT3 with small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly inhibits breast cancer cell growth. Plasmids—pERE-LUC (estrogen-responsive element-containing luciferase reporter), pcDNA3-ERα, and pCMX-SRC-1 have been described previously (37Ding L. Yan J. Zhu J. Zhong H. Lu Q. Wang Z. Huang C. Ye Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5266-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To construct pcDNA3-ERβ, full-length human ERβ cDNA was obtained by standard PCR amplification from a mammary two-hybrid cDNA library (Clontech). The amplified ERβ cDNA was cloned into pcDNA3. For the yeast two-hybrid assay, the bait plasmid pAS2-ERβ-(1–167) was generated by inserting a PCR-amplified cDNA fragment containing the AF-1 region of ERβ into pAS2–1. pAS2-ERβ-(131–324) and pAS2-ERβ-(286–530) were constructed by inserting into the pAS2–1 vector the ERβ cDNA fragments containing the DNA-binding domain and AF-2 domain of ERβ, respectively. pEGFP-NFAT3 was a generous gift from Dr. Toren Finkel (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (38Ichida M. Finkel T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 3524-3530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The FLAG-tagged NFAT3 expression plasmid was cloned into a pcDNA3 vector linked with FLAG at the amino terminus by PCR using pGFP-NFAT3 as the template. Deletion mutants of NFAT3 were constructed by inserting PCR-generated fragments from the corresponding NFAT3 cDNAs into the pcDNA3-FLAG vector. The lac-tagged ERα and ERβ expression plasmids were constructed by inserting corresponding PCR-generated fragments into a pRC-CMV (Invitrogen) vector linked with amino acids 1–355 of Escherichia coli lac repressor at the amino terminus. Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins were prepared by amplification of each sequence by standard PCR methods, and the resulting fragments were inserted in frame into pGEX-KG (Amersham Biosciences). All plasmids were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and DNA sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—The Matchmaker two-hybrid system kit (Clontech) was used for detecting specific proteins interacting with the ERβ bait protein as described by manufacturer. Briefly, the bait plasmid pAS2-ERβ-(1–167) and a human mammary cDNA prey library (Clontech) were sequentially transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CG1945. Transformants were plated on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but containing 1 mm 3-aminotriazole. Approximately 0.6 million transformants were screened. The candidate clones were rescued from the yeast cells and reintroduced back to the same yeast strain to verify the interaction between the candidates and the ERβ bait. The specificity of the interaction was determined by comparing the interactions between the candidates and various bait constructs. The unrelated prey plasmid pACT2-lamin and the empty vector pACT2 were examined as negative controls. GST Pull-down Assay—The GST alone and GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia). The expression plasmid for the ERα, ERβ, or NFAT3 was used for in vitro transcription and translation in the TNT system (Promega). The 35S-labeled ERα, ERβ, or NFAT3 was incubated with ∼1 μg of GST fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor tablets from Roche Applied Science) at 4 °C. The beads were precipitated, washed four times with binding buffer, eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, radiolabeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. Coimmunoprecipitation—For transfection-based coimmunoprecipitation assays, 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris at pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor tablets from Roche Applied Science), and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with the lysis buffer and eluted in SDS sample buffer. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting with anti-Lac (Stratagene) or anti-FLAG (Sigma) antibody according to the standard procedures. For detecting interaction of endogenous ERα with NFAT3, human breast cancer ZR75-1 cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with anti-ERα or control serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). After extensive washing with the lysis buffer, the immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis using anti-NFAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Luciferase Assay—ZR75-1, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-435 cells were maintained in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transfection, cells were seeded in 12-well plates containing phenol red-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum (Hyclone). The cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 0.2 μg of ERE-LUC, 50 ng of ERα or ERβ expression vector, 250 ng to 1.0 μg of the expression vector for NFAT3, and 0.1 μg of β-galactosidase reporter as an internal control. After treatment with 10 nm 17β-estradiol (E2), 100 nm 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), or 100 nm ICI 182,780 for 24 h, the cells were harvested. Cell extracts were analyzed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activities as described previously (39Ye Q. Chung L.W. Cinar B. Li S. Zhau H.E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2000; 7: 21-31Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. siRNA Experiments—To construct NFAT3 siRNA expression vector, a DNA fragment containing an inverted repeat of the target sequence GTGAGTGAGATCATTGGCC, corresponding to the coding region 2641–2659 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon, spaced by the 9-nt sequence TTCAAGAGA and a poly(T) stretch as a terminator for RNA polymerase III, was synthesized and cloned under control of the U6 promoter into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pSilencer2.1-U6neo (Ambion). Plasmid pSilencer2.1-U6neo negative control (Ambion) was used as a control vector. This control vector produces universal scramble siRNA that has no significant homology to mouse, rat, or human gene sequences. Transient or stable transfection of the vector-based siRNA into ZR75-1 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For stable transfection, transfected cells were selected in 1200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and screened by Western blot using anti-NFAT3 antibody. RT-PCR Analysis—MCF-7 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-FLAG-NFAT3 or empty vector using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Transfected cells were selected in 500 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for 2–3 weeks. Pooled clones were cultured in the presence or absence of 10 nm E2 for 24 h and used for RT-PCR analysis. Briefly, total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA was reverse transcribed from 1.0 μg of total RNA with oligo(dT) primers using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Biolabs). One microliter of the first strand cDNA synthesis reaction mixture was used for PCR amplification in a total volume of 50 μl. The primer sequences for pS2 are 5′-TGACTCGGGGTCGCCTTTGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTGAGCCGAGGCACAGCTGCAG-3′ (reverse); for cathepsin D, 5′-TGAGGCCATTGTGGACAAGGCAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCACGGTCAAACACAGTGTAGTAG-3′(reverse); for HSP27, 5′-CATGGCTACATCTCCCGGTGCTTC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTTTACTTGGCGGCAGTCTCATC-3′ (reverse); for NFAT3, 5′-CCAGACTCCAAGGTGGTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCAGGCAGGAGGCTCTTCTCCA-3′ (reverse); for β-actin, 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3′ (reverse). β-Actin was used as an internal control (40Ye Q. Chung L.W. Li S. Zhau H.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 373-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Gel Shift Assay—The gel shift assay was performed as described previously (37Ding L. Yan J. Zhu J. Zhong H. Lu Q. Wang Z. Huang C. Ye Q. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5266-5274Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, in vitro translated protein or the same amount of unprogrammed lysate (Promega) was combined with the 32P-labeled ERE (5′-AGCTCTTTGATCAGGTCACTGTGACCTGACTTT-3′) or mutant ERE (EREM; 5′-AGCTCTTTGATCAGTACACTGTGACCTGACTTT-3′) double-stranded oligonucleotide in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 4% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 μg/μl poly(dT-dC)) in the presence or absence of E2 (1 μm). The binding reaction was incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a total volume of 20 μl. Increasing amounts of in vitro translated NFAT3 or the same amount of unprogrammed lysate (Promega) were added to the binding reaction. For antibody supershift analyses, the reactions were incubated with 1 μl of anti-ER (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-NFAT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody for 15 min at room temperature. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on a 5% native polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ZR75-1 cells were cultured in phenol red-free medium for at least 3 days and treated with either ethanol (vehicle) or 10 nm E2 for various times as indicated. ChIP assays were performed as described previously with minor modification (41Aiyar S.E. Sun J. Blair A.L. Moskaluk C.A. Lu Y. Ye Q. Yamaguchi Y. Mukherjee A. Ren D. Handa H. Li R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2134-2146Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde, pelleted, and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, at pH 8.1, and protease inhibitors). Cells were sonicated, followed by centrifugation to remove insoluble material. Supernatants were collected and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-ERα or anti-NFAT3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed, and precipitated chromatin complexes were then eluted with 100 μl of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3). Cross-linking was reversed by an overnight incubation at 65 °C. DNA was purified using Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The following primers were used for ChIP PCR analysis: pS2 promoter sense, 5′-GGCCATCTCTCACTATGAATCACT-3′; pS2 promoter antisense, 5′-GGCAGGCTCTGTTTGCTTAAA-3′; pS2 upstream sense, 5′-GCAGTTCCAACAGTATATCACATTG-3′; pS2 upstream antisense, 5′-CATGTTGGCCAGGCTGGTCTCG-3′; cathepsin D promoter sense, 5′-GGTTTCTCTGGAAGCCCTGTAG-3′; cathepsin D promoter antisense, 5′-GTTTGCACCCGGACCGGTCAC-3′; cathepsin D upstream sense, 5′-GTGTCTGTCTGCTCGGGCTTCTGTG-3′; cathepsin D upstream antisense, 5′-GCAGGTCCAAGTCACACAGGAAATG-3′. Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of 20 paired cancerous and noncancerous breasts (obtained from 304th Hospital, Beijing) were used to determine NFAT3 protein expression. The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and pretreated with 3% H2O2 for 20 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. The antibody-binding epitopes of the antigens were retrieved by microwave treatment, and the sections were then preincubated with 10% goat serum to block nonspecific binding. Rabbit anti-human NFAT3 polycolonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:200 was used as the primary antibody, and the specimens were incubated with it for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the addition of biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). 3,3′-Diaminobenzidine was used as a chromogen, and hematoxylin was used for counterstaining. For negative controls, normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or phosphate-buffered saline was substituted for the primary antibody. In addition, preabsorbed antibody with an excess amount of GST-NFAT3 fusion protein or the blocking peptide GSSSLSSWSFFSDASDEAALYA abolished the staining. NFAT3 expression was classified into two categories, depending on the percentage of cells stained and/or the intensity of staining: -, 0–10% positive tumor cells; +, >10% positive tumor cells. Cell Growth Assay—Stable transfection of ZR75-1 cells with expression vector for NFAT3 siRNA or control siRNA was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected in 1200 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) and screened by Western blot with anti-NFAT3 antibody. G418-resistant control and NFAT3 siRNA-transfected pooled or single cell clones were selected in 3 weeks and amplified for cell growth analysis. Briefly, cells were seeded in a 24-well plate. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced by phenol red-free DMEM medium supplemented with 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum and incubated for an additional 24 h. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of 10 nm E2 for 5 days. The medium was changed at day 3. Cell growth was analyzed by crystal violet assay as described previously (42Zhau H.Y. Chang S.M. Chen B.Q. Wang Y. Zhang H. Kao C. Sang Q.A. Pathak S.J. Chung L.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 24: 15152-15157Crossref Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed by 1% glutaraldehyde for 15 min and stained with 0.5% crystal violet for 15 min at room temperature. Plates were washed with distilled water several times and air-dried. The dye was eluted by Sorenson's solution for 30 min at room temperature with constant shaking. A microplate reader was used to read aliquots of eluant at 590 nm. Identification of NFAT3 as an ERβ-interacting Protein—To identify proteins that could be involved in regulation of ER signaling, we screened a human mammary cDNA library using amino acids 1–167 containing the ERβ AF1 domain as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. Several positive clones were identified to interact with the ERβ, one of which carries an in-frame fusion of the carboxyl-terminal region of NFAT3 (residues 613–902) to the GAL4 transactivation domain. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed in a direct two-hybrid binding assay (Fig. 1A). Transformation of yeast cells with NFAT3 in pACT2 vector alone or together with the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) in pAS2-1 vector or together with an unrelated protein, lamin C, fused to the GAL4 DBD instead of ERβ-(1–167), did not activate the his and lacZ reporter genes. To examine which region of ERβ binds to NFAT3, yeast two-hybrid experiments were performed again. As shown in Fig. 1A, the ERβ-(1–167) containing the AF1 specifically interacted with NFAT3, but the ERβ-(131–324) containing the DBD and the ERβ-(286–530) containing the AF2 did not. The specific interaction of the ERβ-(1–167) with NFAT3 was not attributable to its high expression level. Conversely, the expression level of the ERβ-(1–167) was lower than that of the ERβ-(131–324) and the ERβ-(286–530) (Fig. 1B). Interaction of NFAT3 with ERα and ERβ in Vitro—To confirm the interaction between NFAT3 and ERβ, GST pull-down experiments were performed in which in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled NFAT3 was incubated with full-length GST-ERβ in the presence or absence of E2. The binding of NFAT3 to GST-ERβ, but not to GST, was observed both in the absence and in the presence of E2 (Fig. 2A). E2 did not significantly increase the interaction of NFAT3 with GST-ERβ. Like E2, antiestrogens, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT), and ICI 182,780 did not affect the ability of NFAT3 to interact with ERβ. As a control for the effectiveness of E2 and antiestrogens in the GST pull-down assay, however, E2 enhanced the binding of SRC-1, an ERα coactivator, to ERα as previously reported (1Klinge C.M. Steroids. 2000; 65: 227-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). NFAT3 also showed interaction with ERα (Fig. 2B). Mapping of the ERβ and NFAT3 Interaction Domains—To delineate the domains in the ERβ that mediate the protein-protein interaction with NFAT3 in vitro, GST pull-down experiments were performed. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, the GST-ERβ-(1–148) containing the AF1 domain bound specifically to in vitro translated 35S-labeled NFAT3, but the GST-ERβ-(145–315) containing the DBD and the GST-ERβ-(248–530) containing the AF2 did not (Fig. 2C). Since the AF1 domain of ERβ has only about 30% homology with that of ERα, the GST-ERα-(1–180)"

Using isotopically labeled proteins and mass spectrometry, we compared subunit exchange in wild-type transthyretin with that of the variant associated with the most aggressive form of the disease, L55P. Wild-type subunit exchange occurs via both monomers and dimers, whereas exchange via dimers is the dominant mechanism for the L55P variant. Because patients with the L55P mutation are heterozygous, expressing both proteins simultaneously, we also analyzed the subunit exchange reaction between wild-type and L55P tetramers. We found that hybrid tetramers containing two or three L55P subunits dominate in the early stages of the reaction. Surprisingly, we also found that, in the presence of L55P transthyretin, the rate of dissociation of wild-type transthyretin is increased. This implies interactions between the two proteins that accelerate the formation of hybrid tetramers, a result with important implications for transthyretin amyloidosis.

Extracellular deposition of insoluble protein fibrils is characteristic of the amyloidoses and is implicated in serious medical disorders, such as Alzheimer disease and the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. More than 20 disparate, normally soluble proteins have been identified, which form a remarkably universal amyloid structure by an, as yet, unrecognized mechanism (1Selkoe D.J.

Transthyretin is a 55-kDa tetrameric protein found in blood plasma and cerebrospinal fluid that transports the hormone thyroxine and, via interactions with retinol-binding protein, vitamin A (retinol). The secondary structure of transthyretin is predominantly β-sheet, with each monomer consisting of eight β-strands (A-H) arranged into two β-sheets, CBEF and DAGH (Fig. 1). Residue Leu-55 is located on the three-residue D-strand, which becomes a long surface loop between strands C and E when Leu-55 is mutated for proline (5Sebastiao M.P. Saraiva M.J. Damas A.M. J. Biol.

Association of monomers to form dimers across the β-sheet interface gives rise to an extended β-sheet structure between strands F and F′ and H and H′.

A number of models have been proposed to explain the mechanism of fibril formation for transthyretin. Although there is general consensus that dissociation of the tetramer at low pH (7Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8654-8660Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) correlates with the formation of amyloid fibrils in vitro (8Gustavsson A. Engstrom U. Westermark P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1159-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), it has not been established whether it is monomeric or dimeric species that are ultimately involved in fibril formation. Evidence for the role of monomeric transthyretin in amyloidogenesis comes from studies of a variant designed to be monomeric in solution (9Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarstrom P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). This variant was found to form fibrils >100 times faster than wild-type transthyretin under low pH conditions but to remain soluble at physiological pH. Partial denaturation of the monomer is also required to produce a conformation that is then capable of assembly to amyloid fibrils in vitro (9Jiang X. Smith C.S. Petrassi H.M. Hammarstrom P. White J.T. Sacchettini J.C. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11442-11452Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 10McCutchen S.L. Colon W. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12119-12127Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). An alternative model involves dissociation of the transthyretin tetramer into amyloidogenic dimers. Support for this hypothesis comes from investigations of a dimeric variant that is prone to amyloid formation (11Olofsson A. Ippel H.J. Baranov V. Horstedt P. Wijmenga S. Lundgren E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39592-39599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and another that forms cytotoxic spherical aggregates (12Matsubara K. Mizuguchi M. Igarashi K. Shinohara Y. Takeuchi M. Matsuura A. Saitoh T. Mori Y. Shinoda H. Kawano K. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 3280-3288Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Spin labeling experiments have demonstrated that many of the interactions found in the native transthyretin dimer are maintained in fibrils (13Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbell W.L. Yeates T.O. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 734-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The role of dimers is also suggested by the numerous x-ray studies of transthyretin and its disease-associated variants (14Hornberg A. Eneqvist T. Olofsson A. Lundgren E. Sauer-Eriksson A.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 649-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), and it has been hypothesized that the extended β-sheet structure, which comprises the β-sheet interface, is a starting point for amyloid fibril formation (15Blake C. Serpell L. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 989-998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar, 16Serag A.A. Altenbach C. Gingery M. Hubbell W.L. Yeates T.O. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9089-9096Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although it is not clear whether a universal mechanism for transthyretin fibril formation will emerge for the various transthyretin variants, the situation is further complicated in vivo, because individuals suffering from familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy are (in general) heterozygous, co-expressing both wild-type and variant proteins in the liver (17Saraiva M.J. Sherman W. Marboe C. Figueira A. Costa P. de Freitas A.F. Gawinowicz M.A. Scand. J. Immunol. 1990; 32: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 18Murakami T. Yi S. Yamamoto K. Maruyama S. Araki S. Ann. Neurol. 1992; 31: 340-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 19Thylen C. Wahlqvist J. Haettner E. Sandgren O. Holmgren G. Lundgren E. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 743-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the process of subunit exchange, which was first postulated more than 30 years ago (20Bernstein R. Robbins J. Rall J. Endocrinology. 1970; 86: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), before the tetrameric structure of transthyretin was even realized, is of particular interest in the heterozygous case. Although most investigations have focused on homogeneous transthyretin tetramers, formation of hybrid tetramers of V30M or A25T and wild-type transthyretin have been reported from experiments employing a 16-amino-acid anionic tag (21Schneider F. Hammarstrom P. Kelly J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 22Sekijima Y. Hammarstrom P. Matsumura M. Shimizu Y. Iwata M. Tokuda T. Ikeda S. Kelly J.W. Lab. Investig. 2003; 83: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 23Wiseman R.L. Green N.S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9265-9274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Ion exchange chromatographic separation demonstrated that the kinetics of subunit exchange in the V30M mutation are closely similar to those measured for the wild-type protein. Using a similar approach, a model for the subunit exchange process in the wild-type protein has recently been proposed (23Wiseman R.L. Green N.S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9265-9274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In this model, rate-limiting tetramer dissociation to four monomers is followed by rapid reassociation of the monomers to form mixed tetramers. Here we investigated the most aggressive of the disease-associated transthyretin variants, that of L55P. We describe a novel mass spectrometry (MS) 3The abbreviation used is: MS, mass spectrometry. approach whereby the subunit composition of intact wild-type and L55P tetramers was monitored as a function of time by incubating solutions in which one set of homotetramers possessed only natural abundance isotopes and the other was uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N throughout. This methodology avoided the use of chemical modification and allowed us to resolve, in real time, the assembly of the five tetramers with unique masses that formed as a result of subunit exchange. A detailed analysis of the kinetics of this process revealed that different subunit exchange pathways were dominant for the wild-type and the disease-related variant. Importantly, we also observed that dissociation of wild-type transthyretin was accelerated in the presence of L55P, suggesting the existence of interactions between the two proteins. Sample Preparation—Recombinant wild-type and L55P transthyretin were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (24Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Isotopically labeled transthyretin was expressed in minimal medium with [15N]ammonium chloride and [13C]glucose (Spectra Stable Isotopes Inc.) as the sole nitrogen and carbon sources respectively. All four proteins were purified as previously described (24Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), with the exception that dialysis was used in place of ion exchange chromatography. Four different solutions were analyzed: wild-type [12C-14N]transthyretin + wild-type [13C-15N]transthyretin, L55P[12C-14N]transthyretin + L55P[13C-15N]-transthyretin, wild-type [12C-14N]transthyretin + L55P [13C-15 thyretin, and L55P [12C-14N]transthyretin + wild-type [13C-15N]trans-N]transthyretin. Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine was used as the reducing agent at a concentration of 1 mm where necessary. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Poole, Dorset, UK) unless otherwise stated. Mass Spectrometry—Immediately prior to analysis, proteins were buffer-exchanged into 200 mm ammonium acetate, pH 7.0 using Micro Bio-spin 6 columns (Bio-Rad). A concentration of 7 μm for each protein tetramer was used for all experiments as determined by UV absorbance spectroscopy (extinction coefficient E280 = 7.76 × 104 m-1) (25Miroy G.J. Lai Z. Lashuel H.A. Peterson S.A. Strang C. Kelly J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 15051-15056Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and verified by amino acid analysis (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge). Nanoflow electrospray mass spectra were recorded on an LCT (orthogonal time of flight) mass spectrometer with a Z-spray source (Waters, Manchester, UK). Typically, 2 μl of solution containing transthyretin was electrosprayed from gold-coated glass capillaries prepared in-house as previously described (26Nettleton E.J. Sunde M. Lai V. Kelly J.W. Dobson C.M. Robinson C.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 553-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). To preserve the non-covalent interactions in the transthyretin tetramer, the MS parameters used were: capillary voltage, 1.7 kV; sample cone, 80 V; cone gas, 130 liters h-1; ion transfer stage pressure, 5.50 millibars; time-of-flight analyzer pressure 2.15 × 10-6 millibars. Under these conditions, no dissociation of the tetramer was observed in the mass spectrum. All spectra were calibrated externally using a solution of cesium iodide (100 mg ml-1) and processed with Masslynx 3.4 software (Waters, UK). Spectra are shown here with minimal smoothing and without background subtraction. The relative abundance of the different types of tetramer was calculated from the intensities of both the 14+ and the 15+ charge states and expressed as a percentage of the total intensity of the peaks assigned to the tetramers. All graphs were produced using SIGMAPLOT 2001, version 9.0 (Systat Software UK Ltd., London, UK). The modeling software was produced in-house and was written in the C++ programming language. Mass Spectrometry of an Isotopically Labeled Transthyretin System—We examined an equimolar solution of wild-type transthyretin containing protein with natural abundance isotopes and protein uniformly labeled with 13C-15N under MS conditions designed to maintain noncovalent interactions (Fig. 2a). The difference in mass between the labeled and unlabeled protein was ∼3 kDa, enabling us to resolve these species in spectra, with peaks corresponding to the 14+ to 16+ charge states of 12C-14N and 13C-15N intact homotetramers. In addition, peaks at high m/z values were assigned to a range of higher oligomers. The masses calculated for these species were consistent with the association of two, three, and four tetramers, each containing a distribution of labeled and unlabeled tetramers. After 27 h, new peaks were observed between the homotetramer peaks corresponding to tetramers with 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 (labeled:unlabeled) subunits (Fig. 2b). These heterotetramers occurred as a result of subunit exchange, which resulted in five possible tetramers with unique masses. By measuring the total intensity of peaks within both the 15+ and 14+ charge states for these five tetramers, we were therefore able to follow the subunit exchange process quantitatively. Initially we investigated the rate of subunit exchange for both labeled and unlabeled wild-type and L55P solutions at 24 and 4 °C (Fig. 3). It was immediately apparent that the rate of subunit exchange was faster for the L55P than for the wild-type at both temperatures. The results also demonstrated that, although the process was significantly slowed at 24 °C for both variants, subunit exchange was occurring at both temperatures. The use of both labeled and unlabeled wild-type and L55P proteins also allowed us to investigate the effect of the isotopic labeling on the subunit exchange process. By comparing the rate of decay of homotetramers in an equimolar solution of labeled L55P with unlabeled wild-type with that of an equimolar solution of labeled wild-type and unlabeled L55P, we found that the rates were indistinguishable within the experimental error (data not shown). The results of these investigations into the decay of the homotetramers allowed us to establish optimum conditions for our subsequent reactions at 4 °C and to conclude that isotopic labeling of either protein had no impact on the rate of subunit exchange. Comparison of L55P Subunit Exchange with That of the Wild Type—We monitored subunit exchange in an equimolar solution of wild-type transthyretin containing protein with natural abundance isotopes and protein uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N. 9 h after initiating the subunit exchange reaction, additional peaks in the mass spectrum corresponding to 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 (13C-15N:12C-14N) heterotetramers were observed (Fig. 4a). As the homotetramer peaks decreased in intensity, with time these additional peaks increased, with the 2:2 peaks remaining at a higher intensity than the 1:3 and 3:1 throughout. After 68 h, no further change was seen, and the intensity of the peaks (0:4, 1:3, 2:2, 3:1, and 4:0) was found to approximate the expected binomial distribution (1:4:6:4:1). We therefore assumed that at this time the reaction was approaching equilibrium. To investigate the effect of the L55P mutation on subunit exchange, we carried out analogous experiments to those described above using equimolar solutions of [12C-14N]L55P and [13C-15N]L55P-transthyretin (Fig. 4c). After just 18 min of incubation, peaks corresponding in mass to 2:2 heterotetramers could be observed, which remained notably more intense than peaks corresponding to the 1:3 or 3:1 species in the early stages of the reaction. After the first hour, the peaks assigned to the 2:2 tetramer were more intense than those of the homotetramers. After 5 h, the reaction approached equilibrium, and the spectrum acquired after 24 h showed the statistical distribution of the 5 tetramers. Comparison of the results for the variant and wild-type protein revealed that subunit exchange was more rapid for the L55P transthyretin. Minimal subunit exchange occurred before 9 h in the case of the wild-type protein, whereas the 2:2 tetramer was observed after just 18 min for the L55P protein. Importantly, we found that, for the L55P variant, the 2:2 tetramer formed significantly faster than the 1:3 or 3:1 species. By contrast, for the wild-type protein, the 2:2 tetramer was formed at a similar rate to the 1:3 or 3:1 tetramers. In summary, we found that the L55P tetrameric protein not only exchanged significantly faster than the wild-type but also the rate of production of the 2:2 tetramer was increased, indicating that L55P subunit exchange proceeded via a different pathway to that of the wild-type. Kinetic Modeling Revealed Mechanisms of Subunit Exchange—To investigate possible mechanisms of subunit exchange, we plotted the intensity of the various homo- and heterotetramers recorded for the two experiments as a function of time. From the mass spectra, it was apparent that the peaks assigned to the tetramers with 2:2 and 3:1 subunits were clearly resolved from neighboring peaks, whereas those for 1:3 tetramers were not. We therefore focused our investigation on the changes in populations of tetramers containing 0:4, 2:2, and 3:1 labeled to unlabeled subunits. The clear difference in the relative rates of formation of the 2:2 and 3:1 tetramers observed in both wild-type and L55P exchange reactions meant that a simple model, involving dissociation of the tetramer to its component monomers followed by rapid reassociation as employed previously (23Wiseman R.L. Green N.S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9265-9274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), would not be able to explain these differences. We considered instead a scenario in which exchange occurred via the dissociation of a single monomer from the tetramer (leaving a trimer) or dissociation of the tetramer to form two dimers via the disruption of either the hydrophobic or β-sheet interfaces (Fig. 1, A and B, respectively). In all cases the dissociation of the tetramer was taken to be the rate-limiting step as suggested by earlier studies (20Bernstein R. Robbins J. Rall J. Endocrinology. 1970; 86: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 21Schneider F. Hammarstrom P. Kelly J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 23Wiseman R.L. Green N.S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9265-9274Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with subsequent rapid reassociation of either monomers with trimers or dimers with dimers. Further details of the model, including equations, can be found in the supplemental material. In the first instance, we considered only the dissociation to monomer and trimer, which proceeded with a rate constant of kd,mon, setting the two dimer dissociation rate constants kd,dimA and kd,dimB to zero. This model, however, was unable to account for the experimental finding that the rate of formation of the 2:2 tetramer was more rapid than that of the 3:1 tetramer (supplemental Fig. 1, S1 and S2). The next model we considered allowed only exchange via both dimer interfaces, setting kd,mon to zero (allowing exchange across only one dimer interface would not lead to the formation of the 1:3 and 3:1 species). Comparison of this model with the experimental data indicated that, although a reasonable fit can be achieved for the L55P, the model overestimates the rate of formation of the 2:2 with respect to the 3:1 for the wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. 1, S3 and S4). We therefore considered exchange of both dimers and monomers between tetramers, allowing all three of the rate constants to vary independently. This model was in close agreement with the experimental data for both the wild-type and L55P proteins (Fig. 4, e and f). Interestingly this model achieves the best agreement with the experimental data when dissociation of the tetramer across only one of the dimer interfaces is significant, i.e. when either kd,dimA or kd,dimB is set to zero. From these fits, we extracted two rate constants, one for dissociation of tetramers via monomers (kd,mon) and one for dissociation of tetramers to dimers formed by the disruption of only one of the two interfaces (kd,dim). For wild-type transthyretin, the rate constants kd,mon and kd,dim were 0.0006 ± 0.00003 min-1 and 0.0005 ± 0.00003 min-1, respectively. For the L55P variant, kd,mon and kd,dim were determined as 0.0075 ± 0.0003 min-1 and 0.011 ± 0.0003 min-1, respectively. Comparison of these rate constants demonstrated that the dissociation of a tetramer to a monomer was ∼12.5-fold faster for the L55P tetramer than for the wild-type protein, whereas dissociation to two dimers was ∼22-fold faster for the variant. This indicates that, for the wild-type tetramer, exchange via monomers and dimers occurs at similar rates, with a marginal preference for the exchange of monomers. For L55P, both reactions were accelerated compared with the wild type, and exchange of dimers between tetramers was faster than that of monomers. To test the validity of our model, simulated mass spectra of the wildtype and L55P tetramers deduced from the proportions of labeled and unlabeled tetramers were compared at representative time points (Fig. 4, b and d). The results showed that the relative intensities of the peaks in the simulated spectra within each charge state were closely similar to the experimental data. Specifically, the model predicts the ratio of the 1:3, 2:2, and 3:1 tetramers for the wild-type protein after ∼24 h and the prevalence of the 2:2 dimers over other heterotetramers after ∼ 1 h of exchange of the L55P variant. The fact that the model is capable of predicting the tetramer populations implies that the kinetic parameters we have deduced are an accurate description of the subunit exchange that is occurring. Formation of Hybrid Tetramers Was Faster than Anticipated—To investigate the mechanism of subunit exchange of hybrid tetramers, we monitored an equimolar solution of L55P and isotopically labeled wildtype transthyretin (Fig. 5). Interestingly, although the spectra from the homogeneous systems investigated in the previous section were largely symmetrical (with the intensity of the peaks assigned to 3:1 being approximately equal to those 1:3 tetramers and similarly for the 4:0 and 0:4 species), this symmetry was absent from the spectra of the heterogeneous system. First, the peaks corresponding to the L55P homotetramer (0:4) were considerably less intense than those assigned to the wild-type homotetramer (4:0) throughout the time course, despite the fact that they had very similar intensities initially. Second, for early time points, the 1:3 wild-type:L55P was more intense than the 3:1, but at later time points, this situation was reversed. After 22 h, the intensities of the tetramers did not change significantly, and we assumed that the subunit exchange reaction was approaching equilibrium. To extend our model to explore the formation of hybrid tetramers, we employed the dissociation rate constants (kd,dim and kd,mon) determined from the wild-type/wild-type and L55P/L55P exchange reactions. These values were then used to produce kd,dim and kd,mon for each of the 14 possible hybrid tetramers, with the assumption that the rate of dissociation correlates directly with the number of L55P subunits (27Hammarstrom P. Wiseman R.L. Powers E.T. Kelly J.W. Science. 2003; 299: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) (supplemental Table). Comparison of the predicted data obtained using the rate constants derived from the homotetramer exchange reactions provided a surprisingly good fit to the subunit exchange kinetics measured for wild-type and L55P proteins in the same solution (Fig. 5d). Specifically, the rate of decay of the L55P homotetramer was closely similar to the rate measured previously, and the data for formation of the 1:3 and 3:1 tetramers were in reasonable agreement with the model. Surprisingly, however, the rate of formation of the 2:2 hybrid tetramer was faster during the early time points of the reaction than predicted by our model. Moreover, from our data, the 2:2 tetramer formed faster than the 1:3 tetramer, whereas the model predicted formation of the 1:3 tetramer and 2:2 tetramer at closely similar rates. When we used this model to predict populations of different tetramers and compared this with mass spectra recorded at selected time points (Fig. 5a) these differences were again apparent. In summary therefore, we found that at all of the time points in the reaction rates derived from the homogeneous transthyretin reactions were not consistent with the increased rate of formation of the 2:2 hybrid tetramer when L55P and wild-type proteins were incubated in the same solution. We investigated this discrepancy by varying our kinetic parameters. Interestingly, we found that the model was insensitive to changes in the rates of dissociation of the hybrid tetramers and fit the data less well when the rate of dissociation to monomers was increased (data not shown). The critical factor in improving the fit of the model was found to be the rate constant for dissociation of the wild-type homotetramer to dimers. An increase of this rate from 0.0005 to 0.001 min-1 resulted in a close fit to the experimental data (Fig. 5, c and e). Specifically, the revised model successfully predicted both a faster rate of decay for the wild-type homotetramers and more rapid formation of the 2:2 rather than the 1:3 tetramer. This observation suggests that, in solutions containing both proteins, dissociation of wild-type homotetramers to dimers is accelerated by interactions with the L55P variant. Using the MS approach described here, we have demonstrated subunit exchange between tetrameric proteins with natural abundance isotopes and those uniformly labeled with 13C and 15N. We have also monitored the formation of hybrid tetramers containing both wild-type and L55P subunits. The wealth of data accrued from these reactions has enabled us to delineate different mechanisms of subunit exchange. Transthyretin is established as one of an increasing number of disparate proteins that undergo subunit exchange reactions (28Bova M.P. Ding L.L. Horwitz J. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29511-29517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 29Nelson S.W. Honzatko R.B. Fromm H.J.

Abulimiti A. Li W. Chang Z.Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 319: 517-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and given the challenges involved in studying this process, it is likely that the approach described here will be widely applicable to a variety of biological systems. The experiments described here have allowed us to deduce that the most appropriate model for the subunit exchange process is one in which both dimers and monomers are exchanged between tetramers. We have extracted rate constants for the individual mechanisms to demonstrate that exchange of monomers and dimers occurs at similar rates for the wild-type protein. Importantly however, exchange via dimers was found to be the dominant mechanism for the L55P variant. The two dissociation events can be combined to provide overall rate constants of 0.017 min-1 and 0.0011 min-1 for the L55P variant and wild-type protein, respectively, with the latter being in close agreement with that determined previously for the wild-type protein (0.0015 min-1) (21Schneider F. Hammarstrom P. Kelly J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have found that the data are consistent with a model that allows exchange of dimers by dissociation across only one of the two possible dimer interfaces. It therefore seems reasonable, in the light of the structural information known, that dimer dissociation occurs via disruption of the predominantly hydrophobic interface. This is supported by a recent publication that describes the effect of linking wildtype transthyretin subunits across the hydrophobic interface and demonstrates that this prevented subunit exchange (33Foss T.R. Kelker M.S. Wiseman R.L. Wilson I.A. Kelly J.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 347: 841-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). We anticipate that the hydrophobic interface would be particularly destabilized under the conditions of our experiment (4 °C), where hydrophobic interactions, in general (34Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science. 2000; (Julet, M. R., ed) pp. , W. H. Freeman and Company, New York: 508-536Google Scholar) and in the specific case of TTR (35Hammarstrom P. Jiang X. Deechongkit S. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11453-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), are known to be disfavored. Results indicating that the L55P point mutation causes the rate of subunit exchange to increase by more than an order of magnitude relative to the wild-type protein are intriguing, particularly because previous studies have shown that the V30M mutation has very little effect on the subunit exchange rate of the protein (21Schneider F. Hammarstrom P. Kelly J.W. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 1606-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). More rapid dissociation and reassociation of monomers from L55P tetramers than from the wild-type protein might be anticipated, given the established propensity of this variant to form amyloid via dissociation to monomers (24Lashuel H.A. Wurth C. Woo L. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13560-13573Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). We were surprised, however, to find that exchange of dimers is the dominant mechanism of subunit exchange for the L55P variant. One possible explanation for this observation might be that disulfide-bonded dimers form between L55P subunits. This possibility was discounted both by the fact that the addition of reducing agent did not affect the rate of exchange (supplemental Fig. 2) and that dissociation of monomers from the tetramer can be induced, under appropriate conditions that disrupt non-covalent interactions, during MS (data not shown). Consequently, rather than the presence of disulfide bonds, these results imply that the L55P point mutation compromises part of the hydrophobic interface, perturbing interactions important for stability and promoting dissociation to dimers in preference to dissociation to monomers. One of the surprising findings from our study of the L55P wild-type system is the different rates of formation of the two hybrid tetramers linked by symmetry, (i.e. 1:3 and 3:1). Because we have established that the dissociation of hybrid tetramers containing L55P is occurring at a faster rate than that of the wild-type homotetramers, any wild-type subunits that are released by dissociation are rapidly redistributed across a large number of predominantly L55P tetramers (Fig. 6). This essentially makes dissociation of the wild-type protein the rate-limiting step. It is also interesting to note that the 3:1 tetramer, containing three wild-type subunits, is prevalent as the reaction approaches equilibrium. It is established that the thermodynamic stability is greater for wild-type than the L55P variant and that stability correlates directly with the number of subunits of the variant protein (36Hammarstrom P.

Lai Z.H. Kelly J.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17851-17864Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To summarize, we have clear evidence that, during the early stages of the reaction the tetramer with one wild-type subunit and three L55P subunits (1wild-type:3L55P) is predominant, when kinetics dictate the reaction products, whereas at equilibrium, when thermodynamic stability is the crucial factor, the 3wild-type:1L55P tetramer population is prevalent. For the hybrid tetramers, the rate of formation of the 2wild-type: 2L55P tetramer is faster than predicted from rate constants derived from the homogeneous solutions. To correct this discrepancy, an increase in the rate of dissociation of the wild-type homotetramers to dimers is required. This strongly implies interaction between the wildtype homotetramers and the L55P components of the system. A plausible mechanism for such an interaction would be the formation, in solution, of transient oligomers larger than the tetramer. This is in accord with the observation of the higher oligomers in the mass spectrum (Fig. 2). It is also possible that the addition of wild-type protein to a solution containing the aggregation-prone L55P might lead to incorporation of wild-type tetramers into soluble oligomers of L55P. Although the nature of these large transient oligomers is not known, we anticipate that interactions within them may destabilize the hydrophobic interface, leading to an enhanced rate of dissociation of dimers from wild-type transthyretin tetramers. Therefore, when the variant and wild type proteins are incubated together, our model is consistent with both proteins exchanging via a similar mechanism, presumably as a consequence of interactions within large oligomers. Given that both wild-type and variant transthyretin are co-expressed in heterozygous individuals (17Saraiva M.J. Sherman W. Marboe C. Figueira A. Costa P. de Freitas A.F. Gawinowicz M.A. Scand. J.

Murrell J.R. Hanes D. Uemichi T. Bock G. Goode J. Costa P. The Nature and Origin of Amyloid Fibrils. 1996Google Scholar)) are important determinants in the fibril formation process. Although it might be anticipated that incorporation of wild-type subunits would have a stabilizing effect on L55P, as observed for T119M in hybrid tetramers with V30M (39Hammarstrom P. Schneider F. Kelly J.W. Science. 2001; 293: 2459-2462Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), heterozygotes with the L55P mutation develop familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy with the earliest age of onset of all transthyretin-associated diseases, indicating that any protective effect is minimal. Moreover, our results suggest that wild-type homotetramers may be incorporated into transient higher oligomers in the presence of L55P, increasing their propensity to dissociate to dimeric species, which may ultimately become trapped in insoluble aggregates. The fact that these hybrid tetramers and transient oligomers are formed within a physiologically relevant time scale has clear implications for disease mechanisms associated with this mutation and, more importantly, for therapeutic strategies designed to prevent them.

Although the mechanism of the TLR signaling pathway has been well documented, the mechanism of the negative regulation in response to LPS, particularly LPS tolerance, is still poorly understood. In this study we identified and characterized a novel interferon- and LPS-inducible gene, FLN29, which contains a TRAF6-related zinc finger motif and TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator-related sequences. The induction of FLN29 was dependent on STAT1. The forced expression of FLN29 in macrophage-like RAW cells resulted in the suppression of TLR-mediated NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, while a reduced expression of FLN29 by small interfering RNA partly cancelled the down-regulation of LPS signaling. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NF-κB activation induced by TRAF6 and TAB2 was impaired by co-expression of FLN29, suggesting FLN29 may regulate the downstream of TRAF6. Taken together, FLN29 is a new negative feedback regulator of TLR signaling. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activates macrophages through toll-like receptor (TLR) 4.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). Among these responses, the production of inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin (IL)-6, as well as reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide (NO), play important roles in protecting the host against bacterial infection. TLR-mediated signaling enhances the ability of dendritic cells to present antigen to T cells, thus leading to the activation of adaptive immune responses (3Pasare C. Medzhitov R. Science. 2003; 299: 1033-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (1804) Google Scholar). Furthermore, LPS also causes B cells to accelerate their expansion and enhances the expression of co-stimulatory molecules such as CD80 as well as CD86 (4Iwasaki A. Medzhitov R. Nat.

Funami K. Akazawa T. Seya T. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar) through the TIR domain in the receptor. Subsequently, MyD88 signals through association with IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) via the death domain in these proteins (11Li X. Commane M. Burns C. Vithalani K. Cao Z. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4643-4652Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Among four species of the known IRAK family, IRAK-1, IRAK-2, IRAK-4, and IRAK-M, only IRAK-1 and IRAK-4 have kinase activity; IRAK-M functions as a negative regulator acting as a dominant negative version of IRAK-1 (reviewed in Ref. 12Janssens S. Beyaert R. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). IRAK-1 binds to TNF-receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 through P-X-E-X-X-(Ar/Ac) motifs in IRAK and the coiled-coil domain of TRAF6 (13Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar), thus leading to the oligomerization of TRAF6 followed by the ubiquitination of TRAF6 for the activation of TGF-β-activating kinase 1 (TAK1). TRAF6 contains the RING finger domain, a zinc finger domain having E3 ligase activity. Upon stimulation, TRAF6 ubiquitinates itself in the presence of E1, Mms2, and Ubc13 in a lysine 63-linked manner (14Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). The polymerized ubiquitin on TRAF6 is regarded as a binding target of cue1-homologous domain and the zinc finger domain of TGF-β-activating kinase 1-binding protein 2 (TAB2), which induces the formation of a complex with TGF-β-activating kinase 1 (TAK1) and TGF-β-activating kinase 1-binding protein (TAB1) (15Kanayama A.

Subsequently, TGF-β-activating kinase 1 activates IKKβ by phosphorylating serine 181; IKKβ is a kinase that forms a complex with IKKα and NF-κB essential modulator. Next, the activated IKKβ phosphorylates the inhibitor of κB α (IκBα) at serines 32 and 36 (16Wang C. Deng L. Hong M. Akkaraju G.R. Inoue J. Chen Z.J. Nature. 2001; 412: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (1651) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IκBα undergoes degradation by a ubiquitin-mediated process (2Akira S. Takeda K. Kaisho T. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 675-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (3958) Google Scholar). Finally, NF-κB, a transcription factor comprising p65 and p50, translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to initiate the transcription of such proinflammatory genes as TNFα, IL-1β, and inducible NO synthase in macrophages. The activation of macrophages must be strictly regulated by a variety of negative regulators, because the hyperactivation of macrophages is usually harmful, even sometimes inducing fatal septic shock. For example, LPS tolerance, a transient hyporesponsiveness of bodies as well as macrophages to the second LPS challenge after first LPS treatment, has been well described; however, the mechanism of tolerance is still poorly understood (17Greisman S.E. Young E.J. Woodward W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1966; 124: 983-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Frankenberger M. Wedel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent studies on the molecular mechanism imply that multiple molecules may be involved in this event. For example, at the receptor level, single immunoglobulin IL-1R-related molecule (19Wald D. Qin J. Zhao Z. Qian Y. Naramura M. Tian L. Towne J. Sims J.E. Stark G.R. Li X. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 920-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) and ST2 (20Brint E.K. Xu D. Liu H. Dunne A. McKenzie A.N. O'Neill L.A. Liew F.Y. Nat. Immunol. 2004; 5: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar) act as the dominant-negative form of TLR4 to modulate externally mediated signaling from pathogens. The short form of MyD88 blocks NF-κB signaling by competitively binding to TLR4 instead of to MyD88 that makes signals weaker (8Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). IRAK-M, a homolog of IRAK that is induced by LPS after 24 h, alternatively interacts with MyD88 to negatively regulate the signaling to TRAF6 (21Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A Cell. 2002; 110 (Jr.): 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). The suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) and SHIP, which contain a phosphorylated tyrosine residue-interacting domain, namely Src homology 2 domain, have also been shown to be involved in LPS tolerance (22Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). IL-10, a well known anti-inflammatory cytokine, also suppresses the TLR signaling; however, the precise molecular mechanism has not yet been clarified. Despite the accumulation of negatively regulating molecules in TLR signaling acting in the membranous region, the cytosolic factor(s) that act as negative regulators remain uncertain. We herein report a novel interferon- and LPS-inducible gene, FLN29, which attenuates TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling by interacting with TRAF6 in macrophages. When FLN29 is stably overexpressed in macrophage-like RAW cells, we found the NF-κB activation and the production of TNFα and NO to be significantly impaired. In contrast, LPS-induced tolerance in vitro was significantly disrupted in FLN29 siRNA cells. Biochemical assays, including luciferase and protein interaction assays, revealed that FLN29 binds to TRAF6 and attenuates NF-κB signaling. Reagents and Antibodies—LPS from Escherichia coli (L-4005, O55: B5), poly(I:C), zymosan (Z-4250), and anti-FLAG (M2) antibody were purchased from Sigma.

Anti-ERK (C-14), anti-TRAF6 (H-274), anti-NF-κB p65 (C-20), and anti-STAT5 (C-17) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibodies for rabbit IgG and mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Microarray Analysis—The RNA samples from monocytic M1 cells treated with or without IFNγ + LPS were subjected to microarray analysis as described (23Joo A. Aburatani H. Morii E. Iba H. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 726-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—RAW and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 units/ml streptomycin in humidified 5% CO2 at 37 °C in the presence and absence of non-essential amino acids, respectively. 293T cells stably expressing TLR4, MD2, and CD14 were purchased from InvivoGen (San Diego, CA) and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions. Plasmids and Preparation of Stable Transformants—The full-length hFLN29 and mFLN29 were amplified by PCR using cDNA from 293T cells for hFLN29 and IFNγ-stimulated RAW cells for mFLN29 and were cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV14 and p3xFLAG-CMV10, respectively. Deletion mutants and point mutants were generated by PCR by a standard technique and the sequences verified by capillary electrophoretic analysis. We delivered plasmids to RAW264.7 cells by electroporation (250 V, 950 μF), and the transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Northern Blotting—RNA was isolated from the cells using Isogen reagent (Nippongene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FLN29 mRNA was detected by Northern blotting in total cellular RNA using a 1-kb fragment of mFLN29 cDNA probe prepared by the digoxigenin method (Roche Applied Science) liberated from TA vector with ScaI. Total RNA were separated on 1% formaldehyde-containing denaturing agarose gels and then were transferred to positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Applied Science). The membrane was incubated with a digoxigenin-labeled RNA probe in hybridization buffer at 68 °C. Luciferase Assay—The NF-κB reporter gene containing three binding sites of κB has been previously described (24Yasukawa H. Ohishi M. Mori H. Murakami M. Chinen T. Aki D. Hanada T. Takeda K. Akira S.

Plasmids encoding the reporter gene, β-galactosidase, activators for NF-κB signaling as indicated in the figures, and various amounts of FLN29 plasmids were transfected into 293T cells in 24-well plates by the calcium phosphate method. After 48 h, the luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer. The preparation of cell lysates and the measurement of the luciferase activity have been described previously (25Masuhara M.

GST Pull Down and Immunoblotting—Transiently transfected 293 cells (1 × 107) were lysed using Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF,5mm Na3VO4, and protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) and incubated with purified GST-hFLN29 protein (10 μg) and 50% suspension of glutathione-Sepharose (10 μl) (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C overnight. Subsequently, gel was washed with Tris-buffered saline three times, and immunoprecipitated proteins were probed as previously described (27Saeki K. Miura Y. Aki D. Kurosaki T. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Measurement of Cytokines—The concentrations of TNFα were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Amersham Biosciences) (24Yasukawa H. Ohishi M. Mori H. Murakami M. Chinen T. Aki D. Hanada T. Takeda K. Akira S. Hoshijima M. Hirano T. Chien K.R. Yoshimura A. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Changes in the expression of IP10 mRNA were determined by RT-PCR using the following primers, mIP-10 (forward) aagtgctgccgtcattttct and mIP-10 (reversed) accatggcttgaccatcatc. Determination of NO Metabolites— NO2⋅¯ concentration was determined as a measure of NO metabolites using Griess reagent as reported previously (22Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D.

Preparation of GST Fusion Proteins and Antibody Production—DNA fragments encoding hFLN29 were subcloned into GST fusion protein expression vector pGEX-4T3 (Amersham Biosciences) and transformed into E. coli strain BL21. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified by affinity chromatography. Anti-FLN29 antibody was raised against rabbits by immunizing a full-length protein of bacterially expressed recombinant hFLN29-GST. The protocol was essentially the same as that previously reported (27Saeki K. Miura Y. Aki D. Kurosaki T. Yoshimura A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3015-3026Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Short Interference RNA (siRNA)—The expression vector (psiRNA-hH1neo; InvivoGen) was delivered into RAW cells by electroporation as described above. The following hairpin inserts for psiRNA expression vectors were used, forward, 5′-tcccacaagaagttggagaagaggctcaagaggcctcttctccaacttcttgttt-3′, and reverse, 5′-caaaaaacaagaagttggagaagaggcctcttgagcctcttctccaacttcttgt-3′. Stable transfectants were selected in 1 mg/ml G418. Microscopy—Immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (26Suzuki R. Sakamoto H. Yasukawa H. Masuhara M. Wakioka T. Sasaki A. Yuge K. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura A. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2271-2278Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, followed by staining with primary antibody (1:100) for 1 h at room temperature. In addition, secondary antibodies with fluorescent dye Alexa488 and Alexa546 were reacted for 1 h at room temperature. Images were recorded by immunofluorescence microscopy (AxioPlan 2; Zeiss). Isolation of a Novel TRAF6- and TANK-related Gene—To identify the LPS-inducible gene that potentially modulates the cellular function of monocytes/macrophages, we performed a microarray analysis in monocytic M1 cells. Among the many genes induced by LPS, we noticed the Fln29 gene (Fig. 1A) because its protein product contains a TRAF6-related zinc finger domain and a TANK-related domain (Fig. 1B). Human and mouse (m) FLN29 proteins contain 582 and 576 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 1A). The zinc finger domain of mFLN29 (residues 13-107) has a 27% identity and 52% similarity of the amino acid sequence to those of mouse TRAF6 (residues 134-232) (Fig. 1B). STAT1-dependent Induction of FLN29—We further investigated the regulation of FLN29 protein expression using a specific antibody raised against recombinant hFLN29 that was fused to GST. We found that the treatment with not only LPS but also IFNβ and IFNγ increased the protein levels of FLN29 in both RAW cells (Fig. 1C) and mouse peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1D). Leukemia-inducible factor did not induce the production of FLN29 protein. Among them, IFNβ was the most potent and rapid inducer of FLN29. Cytokines such as LPS, IFNγ as well as IFNβ induced the accumulation of phosphorylated STAT1, whereas leukemia-inducible factor induced phosphorylated STAT3 without accumulating any phosphorylated STAT1. In addition, we examined the effect of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4 as well as IL-10 on the expression of FLN29 protein. Neither of these cytokines induced the accumulation of FLN29 protein in RAW cells, whereas these cytokines did induce the phosphorylation of STAT6 and STAT3, respectively. Furthermore, LPS did not induce the production of FLN29 in the presence of IL-4 or IL-10, probably because of the suppression of STAT1 activation by these cytokines (data not shown). Therefore, we confirmed the role of STAT1 in FLN29 induction using bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from STAT1-deficient mice. As shown in Fig. 1E, the accumulation of FLN29 protein in STAT1-deficient BMDM was severely impaired in response to LPS and IFNβ. In addition, the accumulation of mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) was abolished in STAT1-deficient MEFs, thus clearly demonstrating that FLN29 expression entirely depends on STAT1 (data not shown). Because the LPS-induced STAT1 activation is shown to be dependent on IFNβ, which is induced via the TRIF-IRF3 pathway, FLN29 induced by LPS is probably induced by STAT1 activated by IFNβ. We next examined the mRNA levels of FLN29 gene in macrophage-like RAW cells in response to various stimulations (Fig. 1F). A marked accumulation of the mRNA of FLN29 was observed in response to LPS as well as IFNγ, whereas there was no induction in mRNA by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation. Regarding tissue distribution, FLN29 was widely expressed in the tissue from mice (Fig. 1G) and human cell lines (data not shown); however, the expression levels in these tissues were relatively low compared with that in IFN-activated RAW cells. These data suggest that interferon- and LPS-inducible FLN29 may have a potential role in modulating the inflammatory function of macrophages. Effect of Overexpression of FLN29 on LPS Signaling—To address this possibility, we established RAW cell clones in which the FLN29 gene has been stably transformed (Fig. 2A). For this purpose, the expression pCMV vector carrying FLAG-tagged FLN29 was transfected into RAW cells and stable clones were selected. In transformants stably expressing FLN29, the accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα as well as phosphorylated ERK appears to be less than that in parental cells over 60 min after stimulation (Fig. 2B), indicating that FLN29 acts as a suppressor of TLR signaling. We further examined the biological effect of FLN29 using stable transformants. The accumulation of NO2⋅¯ in response to LPS increased up to 24 h in parental cells, whereas such accumulation was impaired in FLN29 transformant cells (Fig. 2C). As shown in Fig. 2D, we found a significant suppression of NO2⋅¯ in the range of 10 ng/ml-10 μg/ml LPS. Similarly, the amount of produced TNFα from FLN29 transformants was significantly attenuated over the 10 ng/ml-10 μg/ml range of LPS. In contrast to LPS signaling, the stimulation of these cells with other macrophage activators such as IFNγ produced an equal secretion of NO2⋅¯, demonstrating that FLN29 transformants have the same capacity to produce NO2⋅¯ in comparison with parental cells (Fig. 2F). To further examine whether FLN29 specifically attenuates the LPS-induced NF-κB pathway, we investigated the accumulation of IP10 mRNA (Fig. 2G). It has been shown that IP10 is induced through the MyD88-independent, IRF3-dependent IFNβ pathway (28Kawai T. Takeuchi O. Fujita T. Inoue J. Muhlradt P.F. Sato S. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 5887-5894Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). There was no difference in the accumulation of IP10 mRNA between the two cell lines, thus suggesting that FLN29 does not impair the IRF3-mediated chemokine production in response to LPS. Effect of FLN29 Knockdown on LPS Tolerance—Next, we established FLN29 siRNA cells (Fig. 3A). After treating the control cells with 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 h, a significant amount of FLN29 protein was accumulated, whereas no such accumulation was observed in FLN29 siRNA-1 cells in which effective FLN29 siRNA was transfected (Fig. 3A, left). However, there was no suppression of FLN29 protein levels after LPS stimulation in ineffective siRNA transformants (Fig. 3A, right, FLN29 siRNA-2). There were no significant changes in the accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα and phosphorylated ERK over 30 min in parental RAW cells and FLN29 siRNA-1 cells (Fig. 3B, pretreatment (-)). This result was expected because FLN29 protein levels were very low in the early stage of LPS stimulation in RAW cells. Then we examined the effect of siRNA on multiple LPS stimulation. The pretreatment of LPS is known to cause cells to be less responsive to second challenge of LPS, known as LPS tolerance. As shown in Fig. 3B, second LPS stimulation induced much less phosphorylation of IκBα in parental RAW cells pretreated with LPS for 8 h. However, a significant accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα was observed in FLN29 siRNA-1 cells even by the second LPS treatment (Fig. 3B, LPS 8h). These data suggest that endogenously produced FLN29 protein suppressed LPS-induced NF-κB activation. We further examined the changes in NO2⋅¯ and TNFα from these cells as a readout of NF-κB activation. As expected, the production of NO2⋅¯ and TNFα from control cells was significantly impaired by the pretreatment with LPS (Fig. 3, C and D, closed squares) in comparison to non-treated cells (open squares). In sharp contrast, significant levels of NO2⋅¯ and TNFα were produced from LPS-pretreated FLN29 siRNA-1 cells (Fig. 3, E and F, closed squares). Such a break of tolerance was not obvious in ineffective FLN29 siRNA-2 (Fig. 3G), suggesting that knock down of FLN29 siRNA was specifically involved in this phenomenon. Although parental RAW cells and FLN29 siRNA cells behaved quite differently in LPS tolerance, these cells produced an equal amount of NO2⋅¯ in response to 10 ng/ml IFNγ (Fig. 3H). The accumulation of IP10 mRNA was also similar in control and FLN29 siRNA-1 cells, suggesting that FLN29 specifically attenuates the MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation pathway (Fig. 3I). These data confirmed that FLN29 plays an important regulatory role in NF-κB activation during TLR tolerance. Role of FLN29 in Signal Transduction by Other TLR Ligands—We asked whether the signaling through other TLR ligands might be similarly inhibited by FLN29. A significant decrease in the phosphorylation of IκBα, ERK, JNK, and p38 was observed in the FLN29 stable transformants (data not shown). Then we examined the effect of LPS pretreatment on other TLR ligand stimulation. As expected, both in control and in FLN29 siRNA cells, there was an accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα and phosphorylated ERK in response to these stimuli. However, pretreatment of 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 h with control cells resulted in no accumulation of phosphorylated IκBα or phosphorylated ERK (Fig. 4A, bottom right). However, such down-regulation was not obvious in the FLN29 siRNA-1 cells (Fig. 4A, top right). We further investigated the accumulation of TNFα from FLN29 siRNA-1 cells as a measure of NF-κB activation in response to different TLR ligands. In control cells, pretreatment of 100 ng/ml LPS for 8 h dramatically attenuated the production of TNFα in response to the second stimulation with LPS as well as CpG and poly(I:C) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the amount of formed TNFα (Fig. 4C) from FLN29 siRNA-1 cells was significantly increased when FLN29 siRNA-1 cells were first treated with LPS for 8 h followed by restimulation with LPS as well as CpG and poly(I:C) for 24 h. We concluded that FLN29 acts as a negative regulator of NF-κB signaling in response to LPS as well as poly(I:C) and CpG in macrophages. FLN29 Inhibits TLR Signaling by Interacting with TRAF6—To define the molecular mechanism of FLN29-mediated suppression of TLR signaling, we performed a transient NF-κB reporter assay in 293 cells. The NF-κB reporter gene was activated in response to LPS in 293 cells stably expressing TLR4, MD2, and CD14, and this NF-κB activation was suppressed by the expression of FLN29 (Fig. 5A). We next examined the effect of FLN29 on NF-κB activation by the TLR signaling components. Although FLN29 significantly attenuated NF-κB activation induced by TRAF6 + TAB2, FLN29 had little effect on the NF-κB activation induced by TGF-β-activating kinase 1 + TAB1 as well as IKKβ, thus suggesting that FLN29 acts between TRAF6 and TAB2. In addition to the classical NF-κB activation pathway involving MyD88, the TRIF-dependent NF-κB activation pathway that uses TRAF6 as an adaptor has been recently revealed (29Sato S. Sugiyama M. Yamamoto M. Watanabe Y. Kawai T. Takeda K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 4304-4310Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). As expected, the expression of FLN29 suppressed TRIF-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 5A). FLN29 also suppressed IL-1β-induced NF-κB activation (data not shown). These data further suggest that FLN29 attenuates NF-κB activation through TRAF6. The association of FLN29 and FLAG-tagged TRAF6 transfected to 293T cells was observed by immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 5B). Using FLN29 overexpressing RAW cells, we were also able to detect FLN29 protein associated with endogenous TRAF6, indicating that FLN29 interacted with TRAF6 in these cells (Fig. 5C). These data suggest that FLN29 inhibits TRAF6 activity by a direct binding to TRAF6. Identification of the Domains of FLN29 Responsible for the Interaction with TRAF6—To examine the relevant region in FLN29 for the inhibition of TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation, we created a series of deletion mutants of FLN29 and then assessed their ability for inhibition (Fig. 6A). The C-terminal deletion mutant FLN29-(1-210) had no inhibitory effect on the TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation. However, FLN29-(1-270) mutant could suppress NF-κB activation, thus suggesting that FLN29 amino acids 210-270 could be one of the inhibitory region(s). This was further supported by N-terminal deletion constructs such as FLN29-(173-576). In N-terminal deletion mutants, we also found that FLN29-(301-576) partially suppressed the TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas FLN29-(391-576) failed to suppress NF-κB activation at all. However, the effect of NF-κB inhibition by the FLN29 C-terminal region (301-576) was relatively weak in comparison to that in the N-terminal region (1-270). These data suggest that there are two inhibitory regions, (210-247) and (301-390), for TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation, although the C-terminal part has a weaker effect compared with the N-terminal part. Because FLN29 contains a TANK-related region in FLN29-(249-304) as indicated in Fig. 1B, we also created a mutant lacking this region, FLN29-(Δ247-304), and performed a reporter assay to test whether the TANK-related region might inhibit TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation. However, the mutant lacking the TANK-related region also attenuated NF-κB activation, clearly demonstrating that this region is irrelevant for inhibition. The central part of FLN29 containing amino acids 173-390 therefore clearly suppressed the TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation. Given that the central part of FLN29 might be the relevant region that causes such inhibition, we hypothesized that FLN29-(173-390) might bind to TRAF6. To examine this possibility, we performed a GST pull-down experiment by reacting GST-tagged TRAF6 and FLAG-tagged FLN29 and its deletion mutants (Fig. 6B). As expected from an NF-κB reporter assay (Fig. 6A), FLN29-(173-390) bound to TRAF6 (Fig. 6B). In contrast, we could not detect the interaction of TRAF6 with FLN29-(391-576) and -(1-210), thus supporting the notion that the central part of FLN29 that inhibits NF-κB activation is physically bound to TRAF6. To explore the binding region in TRAF6 with FLN29, the reaction of His-tagged FLN29 and GST-tagged TRAF6 and its deletion mutants was examined. We found that only the C-terminal region containing the coiled-coil domain of TRAF6 was co-precipitated with FLN29 (Fig. 6C). We concluded that the central region of FLN29 that interacts with the C-terminal region of TRAF6 attenuates TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation. We have herein described the cellular and molecular function of FLN29, a novel interferon- and LPS-inducible gene that acts as a negative regulator in TLR signaling. It has been well recognized that the pretreatment of macrophages with LPS causes endotoxin tolerance, which makes macrophage less responsive to a second challenge of LPS (17Greisman S.E. Young E.J. Woodward W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1966; 124: 983-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Frankenberger M. Wedel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We herein propose that FLN29 functions as an LPS-inducible negative regulator in innate immunity while FLN29 may thus play an important role in endotoxin tolerance. LPS tolerance is a transient hyporesponsive state to second LPS stimulation (17Greisman S.E. Young E.J. Woodward W.E. J. Exp. Med. 1966; 124: 983-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 18Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Frankenberger M. Wedel A. Immunobiology. 1995; 193: 217-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under pathophysiological conditions, it has been well recognized that inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1 reach maximal levels after 1-3 h of LPS injection in serum (30Abbas A.K. Lichtman A.H. Pober J.S. Cellular and Molecular Immunology. 2000; (W.B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia eds)): 235-269Google Scholar). It has been well documented that LPS regulates the expression of multiple genes. They are shown to be involved in LPS tolerance at different times after stimulation. For example, LPS induces SOCS-1 gene expression after 1-3 h of stimulation (22Kinjyo I. Hanada T. Inagaki-Ohara K. Mori H. Aki D. Ohishi M. Yoshida H. Kubo M. Yoshimura A. Immunity. 2002; 17: 583-591Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). In contrast, the induction of IRAK-M, which blocks the signaling at IRAK, occurs after 24 h of LPS stimulation (21Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A Cell. 2002; 110 (Jr.): 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, FLN29 is induced ∼8 h after LPS stimulation and the physiological role of FLN29 could be attributed to a negative regulator of TLR signaling. Although the production of cytokines through the transcription of genes still occurs, many studies have shown the amount of the activated form of upstream signaling molecules, including phosphorylated kinases, reaches the initial levels within several hours. In theory, it is possible that LPS can restimulate macrophages once the dephosphorylation of activated IκBα and mitogen-activated protein kinases occurs. However, because of LPS tolerance, such a case does not normally occur because LPS-inducible protein(s) such as FLN29 block LPS signaling by suppressing the function of adaptor proteins like TRAF6. Alternatively, FLN29 might be involved in the termination of LPS signaling. Further studies are underway to define the physiological relevance of FLN29 in response to LPS in animal models. Because the induction of FLN29 is dependent on STAT1, we speculate that FLN29 induction by LPS or other TLR ligands is a result of IFNβ that is rapidly induced by TLR stimulation through IRF3 or some other unknown mechanisms. In fact, IFNβ is the strongest inducer of FLN29 among IFNβ, IFNγ, and LPS within examined. FLN29 is therefore not like A20 or IκBα, which are directly induced by NF-κB. FLN29 could thus be a relatively late phase negative regulator. On the other hand, in some cases IFNs suppress TLR signaling to abrogate the harmful hyperactivation of macrophages (21Kobayashi K. Hernandez L.D. Galan J.E. Janeway C.A. Medzhitov R. Flavell R.A Cell. 2002; 110 (Jr.): 191-202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar, 31Crespo A. Filla M.B. Murphy W.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 710-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Usually, IFNγ and LPS synergistically activate macrophages. However, SOCS1 induced by TLR ligands suppresses IFNγ signaling. FLN29 could be a mechanism of IFN-mediated suppression of the TLR signaling pathway. SOCS1-deficient mice die within 3 weeks after birth with severe inflammation because of the infiltration of macrophages into most organs. As a result, in a manner similar to SOCS1, FLN29 may inhibit an overactivation of macrophages, and it is therefore necessary to control inflammation. FLN29 knock out mice can therefore help to clarify the physiological function of FLN29 in vivo. FLN29 contains a zinc finger motif (residues 13-107) that is similar to that in TRAF6 protein with 27% of homology. We assumed that the zinc finger moiety of FLN29 might be related to the regulation of NF-κB signaling. However, our biochemical study using an NF-κB reporter assay and a protein interaction assay revealed that the central part of FLN29, but not N- or C-terminal regions, bound to the C-terminal region containing the coiled-coil region of TRAF6 and this region was sufficient to attenuate TRAF6-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 6). The activation of TRAF6 by TLR signaling has been well studied: the mechanism includes the binding of TRAF6 with IRAK, the oligomerization of TRAF6 followed by self-ubiquitination, and activation of TGFβ-activating kinase 1. Among many possibilities, we first thought that FLN29 might prevent the binding of TRAF6 with upstream molecules such as IRAK, because previous studies have reported that the proteins that inhibit NF-κB signaling through TRAF6 normally contain the P-X-E-X-X-(Ar/Ac) motif in the sequences to disturb interaction between IRAK and TRAF6 (13Ye H. Arron J.R. Lamothe B. Cirilli M. Kobayashi T. Shevde N.K. Segal D. Dzivenu O.K. Vologodskaia M. Yim M. Du K. Singh S. Pike J.W. Darnay B.G. Choi Y. Wu H. Nature. 2002; 418: 443-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Actually, mFLN29 contains a TRAF6 binding sequence. We therefore created an EA mutant of mFLN29 in which glutamate at 294 has been replaced by alanine. However, such a mutant also attenuated TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation as FLN29 wild type did (data not shown). Furthermore, FLN29 overexpression did not affect the binding between IRAK and TRAF6 (data not shown). Second, we speculated that attenuation of ubiquitination of TRAF6 by FLN29 contributes to the impairment of TLR-mediated NF-κB signaling, because a RING finger domain and zinc finger domains of TRAF6 protein in its N-terminal catalyze the self-ubiquitination of TRAF6 in the presence of E1, Mms2, and Ubc13 (14Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1524) Google Scholar). However, so far the ubiquitination reaction of TRAF6 has not been affected by the FLN29 overexpression (data not shown). Therefore, we currently hypothesize that FLN29 might inhibit the downstream of TRAF6. Further study is underway to define the precise molecular mechanism of the suppression of the TRAF6-mediated NF-κB signaling by FLN29. We thank T. Yoshioka for technical assistance and Y.

https://openalex.org/W2021951468,"In a yeast two-hybrid screen designed to identify novel effectors of the Gβγ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, we found that Gβγ binds to histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), an enzyme involved in a pathway not previously recognized to be directly impacted by G proteins. Formation of the Gβ1γ2-HDAC5 complex in mammalian cells can be blocked by overexpression of Gαo, and this inhibition is relieved by activation of α2A-adrenergic receptor, suggesting that the interaction occurs in a signal-dependent manner. The C-terminal domain of HDAC5 binds directly to Gβγ through multiple motifs, and overexpression of this domain mimics the C terminus of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2, a known Gβγ scavenger, in its ability to inhibit the Gβγ/HDAC5 interaction. The C terminus of HDAC4 shares significant similarity with that of HDAC5, and accordingly, HDAC4 is also able to form complexes with Gβ1γ2 in cultured cells, suggesting that the C-terminal domain of class II HDACs is a general Gβγ binding motif. Activation of a Gi/o-coupled receptor results in a time-dependent activation of MEF2C, an HDAC5-regulated transcription factor, whereas inhibition of the interaction with a Gβγ scavenger inhibits MEF2C activity, suggesting a reduced potency of HDAC5-mediated inhibition. Taken together, these data imply that HDAC5 and possibly other class II HDACs can be added to the growing list of Gβγ effectors.

Information from such stimuli is initially transduced through heterotrimeric G proteins; activated receptors catalyze the dissociation of the Gα and Gβγ subunits and, thus, modulation of the subunits' downstream effectors (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the activation state of a partner Gα subunit, the Gβγ functional monomer interacts with an increasingly apparent number of signaling proteins (2Clapham D.E. Neer E.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 167-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), including well known effectors such as phosphoinositide 3-kinases and phospholipases C and more recently discovered interacting partners such as the ubiquitin-related protein PLIC-1 (3N′Diaye E.-N.

In a recent effort to expand our understanding of Gβγ function, we conducted a yeast two-hybrid screen seeking to identify novel Gβγ-interacting proteins. Results from this screen led to the identification of an isoform of the receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) and several other WD40-repeat containing proteins as Gβγ binding partners (5Dell E.J.

These results led to the hypothesis that interactions between WD40 domains may be a general phenomenon and that the WD40 domain may serve in part to increase the speed and specificity of signaling events by acting as a versatile scaffold in diverse signaling pathways (5Dell E.J.

Lin F. Dell E.J. Hamm H.E. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 399-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Importantly, RACK1 was identified as an effector-specific modulator of Gβγ signaling in vivo (7Chen S. Dell E.J. Lin F. Sai J. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 17861-17868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). An emerging paradigm in the field of GPCR function that is typified by the RACK1/Gβγ interaction is the role of cross-talk with other signaling paradigms. For example, in its ability to interact with molecules downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases and transforming growth factor receptors, RACK1 may serve as a nexus mediating the cross-talk between numerous types of pathways (8McCahill A. Warwicker J. Bolger G.B. Houslay M.D. Yarwood S.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 1261-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Furthermore, both Gβγ and receptor tyrosine kinases modulate the activity of the β isoform of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (for review, see Ref. 9Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar), and GPCR activation can result in transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases in the modulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades (for review see 10Wetzker R. Bohmer F-D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). One potential signaling partner for G protein pathways that has been largely unexplored is protein acetylation, a signaling mechanism of increasingly apparent importance (11Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1176-1179Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar). The most well studied acetylation events govern access to the information encoded in the genome. At appropriate times, the acetylation states of histones associated with specific genes are controlled by a plethora of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). By altering local chromatin structure and providing binding sites for numerous transcription factors, HATs typically act to increase transcription at a specific site, whereas HDACs often act as transcriptional co-repressors by opposing the actions of HAT enzymes (12Cheung W.L. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 326-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Two types of enzyme catalyze histone deacetylation, namely the NAD+-dependent sirtuins and the Zn2+-dependent HDACs (13Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 14Grozinger C.M. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2002; 9: 3-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The latter family is subdivided into at least two classes. Class I HDACs (HDACs 1, 2, 3, and 8) are most similar to the yeast regulator of potassium dependence 3 (Rpd3p). These enzymes are ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues and cell lines. Homologous to the class I HDACs are class II HDACs, which are most similar to a yeast HDAC known as Hda1p. Class II HDACs (HDACs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11) generally have more restricted distributions than those of class I; HDAC5, for example, is most highly expressed in cardiac smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, and brain (15Grozinger C.M. Hassig C.A. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4868-4873Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, 16Verdel A. Khochbin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2440-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition to distinct tissue distributions, a subset of class II HDACs are characterized by N-terminal extensions with well studied roles in protein-protein interactions (17Berger I. Bieniossek C.

Khochbin S. Epstein A.L. J. Virol. 2004; 78: 6744-6757Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and subcellular distribution. In addition to their long (∼400-600 amino acid) N-terminal domains, some class II HDACs also have a relatively short (∼150 amino acid) and well conserved domain at their extreme C termini. In addition to a signal-responsive nuclear export signal (19McKinsey T.A. Zhang C-L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), other functions of this domain are emerging (20Lee H-J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The current report investigates a role for the interaction of Gβγ with class II histone deacetylases, including HDAC5, which is the second novel Gβγ binding partner discovered in the previous yeast two-hybrid screen. Interestingly, the C terminus of a related class II HDAC, HDAC7, has been shown to interact with a GPCR, endothelin receptor A, and possibly to modulate an endothelin-1-stimulated MAPK pathway (20Lee H-J. Chun M. Kandror K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16597-16600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Here, we show that Gβγ interacts with the C-terminal domain of HDAC5 and provide evidence that signaling through Gβγ has an inhibitory effect on HDAC5 function. Thus, HDAC5 may be added to the long and growing list of effectors of the signaling capacity of Gβγ.

Trichostatin A (TSA) and other chemicals were of the highest grade available and were typically from Sigma. Endogenous Immunoprecipitations and Deacetylase Assays—Heart tissue from two normal adult Sprague-Dawley rats was lysed with 15 strokes of a tight-fitting Dounce homogenizer in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% deoxycholate, 1% Igepal, 0.5% SDS, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors (lysis buffer). The soluble portion of this lysate was pre-cleared by incubation with protein G-Sepharose beads. Four micrograms of purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies against Gβ or the His probe were added, and the mixtures were incubated on ice overnight. A 50-μl bed volume of protein G-Sepharose was added, and the tubes were incubated with gentle mixing at 4 °C for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were collected via centrifugation and washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Ten percent of the resin was removed for Western blot analysis. The remaining resin was assayed for deacetylase activity using a commercially available assay kit essentially as described (Upstate). Plasmid Construction—Plasmids directing the expression of bovine Gγ2 and N-terminally HA-tagged bovine Gβ1 in mammalian cells under the control of the human cytomegalovirus promoter were created using conventional molecular biological techniques. Plasmids directing the expression of C-terminally FLAG-tagged human HDACs 4, 5, and 6 were generously provided by Dr. Ed Seto, University of South Florida. A plasmid directing the expression of GαoA with an internal EE epitope tag was obtained from the Guthrie cDNA Resource Center. The α2A-adrenergic receptor expression vector was obtained from Dr. Lee Limbird, Vanderbilt University. The C termini of HDACs 4 and 5 (HDAC4ct and HDAC5ct) were amplified from the corresponding FLAG tag plasmids with the following primers: HDAC4 sense (5′-CACCATGGAGTTTGCCCCGGATGTGGTG-3′); HDAC4 antisense (5′-AATCTCGAGCTACAGGGGCGGCTCCTCTT-3′); HDAC5 sense (5′-CACCATGGAGTTCTCACCTGATGTGGTC-3′); and HDAC5 antisense (5′-AATCTCGAGCTTTGTACAAGAAAGCTGGGTC-3′). The PCR amplification products were ligated into pENTR/SD/D-TOPO from the Gateway cloning system (Invitrogen). The genes were transferred to pDEST26 or pDEST27 (Invitrogen) for expression in mammalian cells with an N-terminal His6 or glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag, respectively. Additionally, HDAC5ct was transferred to pDEST20 for creation of baculoviruses directing the expression of GST-HDAC5ct in Sf9 cells. Viruses were created and amplified according to the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Protein Purification—Sf9 cells (1 × 106) were infected at an approximate multiplicity of infection of one with baculovirus GST-HDAC5ct. Following a 60-h incubation at 28 °C, cells were collected by centrifugation. The cells were swollen for 20 min on ice in hypotonic buffer (20 mm Tris pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The cells were lysed using a hand-held rotary homogenizer. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 150 mm, and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation. Glutathione-Sepharose purification proceeded as recommended (Amersham Biosciences), except that proteins were eluted overnight at 4 °C with 50 mm Tris, 20 mm glutathione, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The proteins were concentrated, and glutathione was removed by buffer exchange with PBS using centrifugal concentrators (Millipore). Gβ1γ1 was purified from bovine rod outer segments as described (21Yamazaki A. Tatsumi M. Bitensky M.W. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 702-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In Vitro Binding Assays—GST or GST-HDAC5ct were incubated at noted concentrations in a final volume of 100 μl with Gβ1γ1. Binding buffer consisted of PBS with 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, 30 μl of a 50:50 slurry of glutathione-Sepharose resin was added to each reaction. The complexes were allowed to bind to the resin for 30 min at 4 °C with constant mixing. The resin was collected by brief centrifugation and then washed three times with 1 ml of PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 and 5 mm dithiothreitol. The complexes were eluted from the resin with SDS-PAGE running buffer and separated by electrophoresis. Cell Culture and Transfections—Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Typically, for a 6-well plate at 80-90% confluence, 1 μg of total plasmid DNA was complexed with 5 μl of lipid reagent in 500 μl of Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen). After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the complexes were added to the cells with 2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 10% serum but no antibiotics. For some transfections, empty vector (pcDNA3.1) was added to keep total DNA at 1 μg. Immunoprecipitations—Forty-eight hours after transient transfections, cells were washed with PBS, and 400 μl of PBS with 0.5% Igepal, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitors, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (lysis buffer) was added. Following a 5-min incubation at 4 °C, the cells were recovered with a cell lifter. The cells were lysed further by 10 passages through a 23-gauge needle with a 1-cc syringe. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation and a pre-clearing step using protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Complexes were immunoprecipitated for 1 h at 4 °C using either anti-FLAG (M2)-agarose or anti-HA agarose (Sigma). The pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer. Proteins were eluted with SDS-PAGE loading dye prior to electrophoresis. Typically, one-half of the supernatant was analyzed by electrophoresis and Western blot. Western Blots—Samples separated with SDS-PAGE were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore). Primary antibodies were detected with specific secondary antibodies covalently linked to Alexa Fluor 680 (Invitrogen) or IRDye800 (Rockland, Inc.). Fluorescent signal was imaged with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Inc.). Assays for Reporter Gene Transfection—Plasmids encoding MEF2C and luciferase downstream of three MEF2C binding sites (3× MEF2-luciferase) were kindly provided by Dr. Eric Olson (22Zhang C-L. McKinsey T.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7302-7312Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). LacZ under control of a cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen) was included as a transfection control. HEK293A cells on 12-well plates were transfected with 0.1 μg of MEF2C, 0.2 μg of 3× MEF2-luciferase, 0.0125 μg of CMV-LacZ, and other plasmids as noted using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent as described above. Total DNA was adjusted to 0.5 μg with empty vector (pcDNA3.1). Two days after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase were harvested with 250 μl of passive lysis buffer as recommended (Promega). Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined with reagents obtained from Promega. Luciferase output was measured with a Wallac Victor2 V 1420 multi-label HTS counter equipped with a 700-nm infrared cutoff filter. Measurements were linear with respect to time and dose of extract. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—Bovine Gβ1 was used as bait to screen a mouse brain library in a previously described yeast two-hybrid assay (5Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Two clones whose expression resulted in reporter gene transcription were found to encode the C-terminal ∼160 amino acids of HDAC5 (data not shown). This result was confirmed by retransformation of the plasmids and co-immunoprecipitation from yeast lysates as described (5Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) (data not shown). In addition, the interaction was found to be independent of the co-expression of mammalian Gγ (data not shown), suggesting that Gβ1 formed a functional dimer with a yeast Gγ-like protein in situ and that binding was mediated by Gβ rather than Gγ. Investigating an in Vivo Interaction—Because of an apparent insensitivity of several anti-HDAC5 antibodies in immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation experiments, the HDAC content of immunoprecipitated Gβ complexes was assessed with in vitro deacetylase assays to confirm the association of Gβ with HDACs in situ. Lysates of heart tissue from normal adult rats were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-Gβ antibody or a control irrelevant rabbit polyclonal antibody. The anti-Gβ antibody specifically precipitated Gβ, as shown in Fig. 1A. As displayed in Fig. 1B, the anti-Gβ antibody precipitates displayed significantly more deacetylase activity than did the control precipitates. To functionally characterize the activity present in the complex, in vitro assays were performed in the presence of TSA, which is a selective inhibitor of the Zn2+-dependent HDAC family of deacetylases. No activity was detected in control or anti-Gβ immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1B), suggesting that HDAC enzymes exist in stable complexes with Gβ in vivo. Interaction with HDAC5 in Particular—Coimmunoprecipitation of epitope-tagged proteins expressed in cultured cells was employed to confirm that Gβ could interact with HDAC5. First, empty vector or N-terminally HA-tagged Gβ1 and untagged Gγ2 were transiently transfected into HEK293A cells with C-terminally FLAG-tagged HDAC5. Two days after transfection, cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, HA-Gβ1 was specifically purified when HDAC5-FLAG was immunoprecipitated, indicating that the proteins can exist in an identical complex in mammalian cells. In the converse experiment, immunoprecipitation of HA-Gβ1γ2 also specifically co-purified HDAC5-FLAG, further supporting the ability of HDAC5 and Gβγ to form a complex in mammalian cells. Direct Gβ/HDAC5 Interaction—The interaction between HDAC5 and Gβγ has thus been shown in both yeast and mammalian systems, suggesting that the interaction is likely direct. However, to further demonstrate that the interaction is not mediated through other molecules, purified proteins were assayed for binding. The C-terminal domain of HDAC5, HDAC5ct, was expressed and purified as a GST fusion protein from a baculovirus/Sf9 system. This protein was assayed for interaction with Gβ1γ1 highly purified from bovine rod outer segments. Equimolar amounts (50 nm) of GST or GST-HDAC5ct were incubated with increasing concentrations of Gβ1γ1 followed by purification with glutathione-Sepharose. As displayed in Fig. 3, Gβ1 specifically co-purified with GST-HDAC5ct, confirming that the proteins interact directly. In addition, to estimate the HDAC5ct/Gβγ affinity, an apparent EC50 was calculated; at 50 nm GST-HDAC5ct, 50% binding is achieved at 330 ± 120 nm Gβγ. Thus, the apparent affinity is similar to that observed for the interaction of Gβγ with RACK1 (5Dell E.J. Connor J. Chen S. Stebbins E.G. Skiba N.P. Mochly-Rosen D. Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49888-49895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The Gβγ/HDAC5 Interaction Is Controlled by Heterotrimeric G Protein Activation—In regard to the regulation of effector molecules, heterotrimeric G proteins containing Gα-GDP are thought to be inactive, with effector regulation occurring upon the receptor-catalyzed exchange of GTP for GDP on Gα and resultant dissociation of the heterotrimer. This mechanism allows activation of receptors to be involved in the temporal regulation of downstream pathways. Accordingly, we sought to determine whether coexpression of Gα could block the ability of overexpressed Gβγ to form a complex with HDAC5. HEK293A cells transfected with HDAC5-FLAG, HA-Gβ1γ2, EE-tagged GαoA, and the Gi/o-coupled receptor α2A-adrenergic receptor were serum-starved overnight. In subsequent anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation assays we observed that complex formation was greatly reduced by Gαo expression (Fig. 4), and anti-EE reactivity was never observed in the immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Together, these data suggest that HDAC5 binds only to free Gβγ, allowing the possibility that the interaction is controlled by activated receptors. To test the hypothesis that Gβγ interacts with HDAC5 upon G protein activation, the ability of stimulation of a Gi/o-coupled receptor to relieve inhibition of complex formation by GαoA was tested. Following serum starvation as described above, the cells were incubated with a β-adrenergic receptor antagonist, 10 μm propanolol, for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then exposed to 10 μm (-)epinephrine to stimulate the α2A-adrenergic receptor for various times, whereupon complex formation was assayed by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation. As shown in Fig. 4, receptor stimulation relieved the Gαo-mediated inhibition of Gβγ/HDAC5 complex formation, suggesting that the interaction is signal-responsive in vivo. The C Terminus of HDAC5 Mediates Gβγ Binding—The yeast two-hybrid assay identified the C terminus of HDAC5 as sufficient for binding to Gβγ. To demonstrate that this domain is the major binding site for Gβγ, we determined the ability of the C-terminal domain to block the interaction between Gβγ and full-length HDAC5. A construct encompassing the C-terminal 172 amino acids of HDAC5 (residues 951-1122 of human HDAC5) was created by PCR amplification. HEK293A cells were transfected with plasmids encoding HDAC5-FLAG and HA-Gβ1γ2 along with increasing amounts of DNA directing the expression of the C-terminal fragment with an N-terminal His6 tag. As shown in Fig. 5A, subsequent co-immunoprecipitation assays indicated that the C-terminal fragment was capable of inhibiting the interaction between HDAC5 and Gβγ. Identification of the C terminus of HDAC5 as a major Gβγ binding site suggested that it might comprise a novel Gβγ interaction domain. Scanning protein sequence data bases with this minimal domain did not reveal conservation among multiple protein families, but it did identify the C-terminal 164 amino acids of HDAC4 as containing significant similarity (∼68% identity and 80% similarity). The C termini of both HDAC4 and HDAC5 were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector directing the expression of N-terminally GST-tagged proteins. Precipitations with glutathione-Sepharose from lysates of HEK293A cells expressing the GST fusions and HA-tagged Gβ1γ2 demonstrated that Gβγ interacts with both proteins (Fig. 5B). In addition to the C-terminal domain, full-length HDAC4 was tested for Gβγ binding by immunoprecipitating C-terminally FLAG-tagged full-length HDAC4. As shown in Fig. 4C, full-length HDAC4 and HDAC5 formed complexes with HA-Gβ1γ2, demonstrating that HDAC4 is another novel Gβγ-binding protein. Furthermore, HDAC6, which has two catalytic domains that are homologous to those of HDAC4 and HDAC5 but lacks the corresponding C-terminal domain, was not observed to form a complex with Gβγ in a parallel experiment (Fig. 5C), indicating specificity of the interaction of Gβγ with HDACs 4 and 5. The Gβγ Binding Motif Comprises Multiple Non-colinear Sequences—To further distinguish the Gβγ-binding element in the C terminus of HDAC5, the domain was dissected via PCR into several fragments (Fig. 6A). These fragments were expressed with HA-Gβ1γ2 in HEK293A cells and were tested for Gβγ binding by glutathione-Sepharose-mediated precipitation from cell lysates. As displayed in Fig. 6B, fragments consisting of the first 58 (fragment 4) or 88 (fragment 5) amino acids bound Gβγ, as did a fragment consisting of the last 113 amino acids (fragment 6). Because fragments 4 and 6 do not overlap, these results suggest that the domain contains multiple sequences required for full Gβγ binding. Of additional significance, fragments consisting of the extreme C-terminal 55 (fragment 2) or 28 (fragment 3) amino acids did not pull down a significant amount of Gβγ under these conditions, suggesting that Gβγ does not bind to the signal-responsive nuclear export signal located within amino acids 1081 to 1122 (19McKinsey T.A. Zhang C-L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 6312-6321Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Signaling through Gβγ Influences Transcription through an HDAC5-repressible Factor—One well studied role of HDAC5 and other class II HDACs is co-repression of the transcriptional activity of the muscle differentiation factor MEF2C. When HDAC5 is associated with MEF2C, the deacetylase creates a repressive environment, inhibiting the ability of the transcription factor to activate gene transcription. The repressive effect of HDAC5 is controlled in several ways, for instance by prevention of the interaction with MEF2C and by sequestration from the nucleus, which is enhanced by phosphorylation and by binding to 14-3-3 proteins (19McKinsey T.A.

https://openalex.org/W1986086455,"Many autosomal dominant diseases such as familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) mutation may be induced by missense point mutations that result in the production of proteins with toxic properties. Reduction in the encoding of proteins from such mutated genes can therefore be expected to improve the disease phenotype. The duplex of 21-nucleotide RNA, known as small interfering RNA (siRNA), has recently emerged as a powerful gene silencing tool. We made transgenic (Tg) mice with modified siRNA, which had multiple mismatch alternations within the sense strand, to prevent the shutdown phenomenon of transgenic siRNA. Consequently, the in vivo knockdown effect of siRNA on SOD1 expression did not diminish over four generations. When we crossed these anti-SOD1 siRNA Tg mice with SOD1G93A Tg mice, a model for ALS, siRNA prevented the development of disease by inhibiting mutant G93A SOD1 production in the central nervous system. Our findings clearly proved the principle that siRNA-mediated gene silencing can stop the development of familial ALS with SOD1 mutation."

The immune repertoire of Camelidae is unique in that it possesses unusual types of antibodies referred to as heavy chain antibodies (1Hamers-Casterman C. Atarhouch T. Muyldermans S. Robinson G. Hamers C. Songa E.B. Bendahman N. Hamers R. Nature. 1993; 363: 446-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). These antibodies lack light chains and thus their combining sites consist of only one domain, termed VHH. 2The abbreviations used are: VHclassical four-chain antibody heavy chain variable domainVHHvariable domain of a heavy chain antibodyCDRcomplementarity determining regionCHheavy chain constant domain of an antibodyFabantigen-binding fragmentFRframework regionNMRnuclear magnetic resonancePFGpulse field gradientRErefolding efficiencyscFvsingle chain Fv fragment of an antibodysdAbsingle domain antibodySPRsurface plasmon resonanceVLantibody light chain variable domain.2The abbreviations used are: VHclassical four-chain antibody heavy chain variable domainVHHvariable domain of a heavy chain antibodyCDRcomplementarity determining regionCHheavy chain constant domain of an antibodyFabantigen-binding fragmentFRframework regionNMRnuclear magnetic resonancePFGpulse field gradientRErefolding efficiencyscFvsingle chain Fv fragment of an antibodysdAbsingle domain antibodySPRsurface plasmon resonanceVLantibody light chain variable domain. Recombinant VHH single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) are comparable with their single-chain Fv (scFv) counterparts derived from conventional four-chain antibodies in terms of affinity, but outperform scFvs in terms of stability, resistance to aggregation, refolding properties, expression yield, and relative ease of DNA manipulation, library construction, and three-dimensional structural determination (2van der Linden R.H.

Many of the aforementioned properties of VHH sdAbs are desired in applications involving antibodies. However, the non-human nature of VHHs limits their use in human immunotherapy because of the immunogenicity issue. In this respect, human VH sdAbs are ideal candidates for therapeutic applications because they are expected to be least immunogenic. However, human VHs are by and large prone to aggregation, a characteristic common to VHs derived from conventional antibodies (7Davies J. Riechmann L. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 285-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 8Tanha J. Xu P. Chen Z.G. Ni F. Kaplan H. Narang S.A. MacKenzie C.R. J. Biol.

Such VHs also displayed other useful properties typical of VHHs, such as high expression yield, high refoldability, and resistance to aggregation. Synthetic libraries built on these VHs as library scaffolds should serve as a promising source of therapeutic proteins.Camelization (7Davies J. Riechmann L.

Synthetic sdAb libraries constructed based on these VHs and generated by complementarity determining region (CDR) randomization were shown to yield binders to various antigens (8Tanha J. Xu P.

Biotechnology. 1995; 13: 475-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In another approach, fully monomeric human VHs were isolated from human synthetic VH libraries without resorting to engineering of the sort mentioned above. In one experiment a monomeric human VH was discovered when a human VH library was panned against hen egg white lysozyme (11Jespers L. Schon O. James L.C. Veprintsev D. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 337: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). More recently, a selection method based on reversible unfolding and affinity criteria yielded many monomeric VHs from synthetic human VH phage display libraries (12Jespers L. Schon O. Famm K. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This finding underlined the fact that an appropriate selection method is key to efficient capturing of rare human VHs with desirable biophysical properties.Here, we provide yet another approach for obtaining monomeric human VHs. We report the isolation of 15 different VHs originating from germlines DP-38, DP-47, V3-49, V3-53, YAC-5, and 8-1B from a phage-displayed naïve human VH repertoire by a selection method that is based on phage plaque size. The VHs, by and large, are also refoldable, retain their native fold following exposure to trypsin at 37 °C or long incubation at 37 °C, and are expressed in good yields in the Escherichia coli. When used as scaffolds, the diversity of the selected VHs should allow for construction of more comprehensive libraries and provide flexibility in terms of choosing an optimal VH scaffold for humanizing therapeutic camelid VHH binders. The current selection method permits high throughput identification of proteins with good biophysical properties by the naked eye, is very simple, eliminates affinity or stability selection steps, and is of general utility.MATERIALS AND METHODSPhage Display Library Construction and Panning—cDNA was synthesized from human spleen mRNA (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) using random hexanucleotide primers and First Strand cDNA® kit (GE Healthcare, Baie d'Urfé, QC, Canada).

To measure the binding of VHs to protein A, 2000 resonance units of protein A or a reference antigen-binding fragment (Fab) were immobilized on research grade CM5 sensor chips (Biacore Inc.). Immobilizations were carried out at concentrations of 25 μg/ml (protein A) or 50 μg/ml (Fab) in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, using the amine coupling kit provided by the manufacturer.

In all instances, analyses were carried out at 25 °C in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% P20 surfactant at a flow rate of 40 μl/min, and surfaces were regenerated by washing with the running buffer. To determine the binding activities of the refolded proteins, VHs or VHHs were denatured by incubation at 85 °C for 20 min at 10 μg/ml concentrations. The protein samples were then cooled down to room temperature for 30 min to refold and were subsequently centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 × g for 5 min at room temperature to remove any protein precipitates. The supernatants were recovered and analyzed for binding activity by SPR as described above. For both folded and refolded protein, data were fit to a 1:1 interaction model simultaneously using BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore Inc.) and KD values were subsequently determined. REs were determined from RE = (KDn/KDref) × 100, where KDn is the KD of the native protein and KDref is the KD of the refolded protein.Tryptic Digest Experiments—Three μl of a freshly prepared 0.1 μg/μl sequencing grade trypsin (Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Mississauga, ON, Canada) in 1 mm HCl was added to 60 μg of VH in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8. Digestion reactions were carried out in a total volume of 60 μl for 1 h at 37°C and stopped by adding 5 μl of 0.1 μg/μl trypsin inhibitor (Sigma). Following completion of digestion, 5 μl was removed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE; the remaining was desalted using ZipTipC4 (Millipore, Ontario, Canada), eluted with 1% acetic acid in 50:50 methanol:water and subjected to VH mass determination by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry.Protein Stability Experiments at 37 °C—Single-domain antibodies at 0.32–3.2 mg/ml concentrations were incubated at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline buffer for 17 days. Following incubation, the protein samples were spun down in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min even in the absence of any visible aggregate formation. The samples were then applied onto a Superdex 75 size exclusion column and the monomeric peaks were collected for SPR analysis of binding to protein A. SPR analyses were performed as described above except that 500 resonance units of protein A or reference Fab was immobilized and immobilizations were carried out at a concentration of 50 μg/ml.NMR Experiments—VH samples for NMR analysis were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.02% NaN3 at pH 7.0. The protein concentrations were 40 μm to 1.0 mm. All NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K on a Bruker Avance-800 or a Bruker Avance-500 NMR spectrometer. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were recorded with 16,384 data points and the spectral widths were 8,992.81 Hz at 500 MHz and 17,605.63 Hz at 800 MHz, respectively. Two-dimensional 1H-1H NOESY spectra of 2,048 × 400 data points were acquired on a Bruker Avance-800 NMR spectrometer with a spectral width of 11,990.04 Hz and a mixing time of 120 ms. In all NMR experiments, water suppression was achieved using the WATERGATE method implemented through the 3-9-19 pulse train (20Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3499) Google Scholar, 21Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; A102: 241-245Crossref Scopus (1108) Google Scholar). NMR data were processed and analyzed using the Bruker XWINNMR software package. All PFG-NMR diffusion measurements were carried out with the water-suppressed LED sequence (22Altieri A.S. Hilton D.P. Byrd R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7566-7567Crossref Scopus (437) Google Scholar), on a Bruker Avance-500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance probe with three-axis gradients. One-dimensional proton spectra were processed and analyzed using Bruker Xwinnmr software package. NMR signal intensities were obtained by integrating NMR spectra in the methyl and methylene proton region (2.3 to -0.3 ppm) where all NMR signals were attenuated uniformly at all given PFG strengths.RESULTSDuring the course of the construction of fully human and llaminated human VH libraries,3 we learned that the phages displaying monomeric llaminated VHs formed larger plaques on bacterial lawns than phages displaying fully human VHs with aggregation tendencies. We thus decided to use plaque size as a means of identifying rare, naturally occurring monomer VHs from the human VH repertoire (Fig. 1). To this end, a phage library displaying human VHs with a size of 6 × 108 was constructed and propagated as plaques on agar plates. On the titer plates, the library consisted essentially of small plaques interspersed with some large ones. PCR on 20 clones revealed that the small plaques corresponded to the VH-displaying phages, whereas the large ones represented the wild type phages, i.e. phages lacking VH sequence inserts. None of the VH-displaying phages were found with large plaque morphology. This was not unexpected because of the paucity of the monomeric VHs in the human repertoire and the large size of the library. To facilitate the identification of monomeric VHs, it was decided to reduce the library size to a manageable one and remove interfering wild type phage with large plaque-size morphology by panning the library against protein A, which binds to a subset of human VHs from the VH3 family.Following a few rounds of panning, the library became enriched for phage producing large plaques, and PCR and sequencing of more than 110 such plaques showed that all had complete VH open reading frames. The size of the large plaques that were picked for analysis is represented in Fig. 1. Sequencing revealed 15 different VHs that belonged to the VH3 family and utilized DP-38, DP-47, V3-49, V3-53, YAC-5, or 8-1B germline V segments (TABLE ONE; Fig. 2). The DP-38 and DP-47 germline sequences have been previously implicated in protein A binding (12Jespers L. Schon O. Famm K. Winter G. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 23Akerstrom B. Nilson B.H. Hoogenboom H.R. Bjorck L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 177: 151-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, all VHs had a Thr residue at position 57 (Fig. 2), consistent with their protein A binding activity (24Bond C.J. Marsters J.C. Sidhu S.S. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 643-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 25Randen I. Potter K.N. Li Y. Thompson K.M. Pascual V. Forre O. Natvig J.B. Capra J.D. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2682-2686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The most frequently utilized germline V segment was DP-47, which occurred in over 50% of the VHs, but the most frequent clone (i.e. HVHP428, relative frequency 46%) utilized the V3-49 germline V segment. HVHP429 with a DP-47 germline sequence was the second most abundant VH with a relative frequency of 21% (Fig. 2). The VH CDR3 lengths ranged from 4 amino acids for HVHB82 to 16 amino acids for HVHP430, with HVHP430 having a pair of Cys residues in CDR3. Amino acid mutations with respect to the parental germline V segment (residues 1–94) and FR4 (residues 103–113) sequences were observed in all VHs and ranged from two mutations for HVHP44 (L5V and Q105R) and HVHB82 (E1Q and L5Q) to 16 mutations for HVHP426 (TABLE ONE). Mutations were concentrated in the V segments; only two mutations were detected in all the 15 FR4s, at positions 105 and 108. HVHP44 and HVHB82 differed from other VHs in that they both had a positively charged amino acid at position 105 instead of a Gln (TABLE ONE, Fig. 2). However, whereas the positively charged amino acid in HVHP44 was acquired by mutation, the one in HVHB82 was germline-encoded. Except for HVHP423 and HVHP44B, the remaining VHs had the germline residues at the key solubility positions (4Nguyen V.K. Desmyter A. Muyldermans S. Adv. Immunol. 2001; 79: 261-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar): 37V/44G/45L/47W or 37F/44G/45L/47W (HVHP428), HVHP423 and HVHP44B had a V37F mutation. Mutations at other positions, which have been shown or hypothesized to be important in VH solubility, included seven E6Q, three S35T/H, one R83G, one K83R, one A84P, one T84A, and one M108L mutation (5Tanha J.

The total “frequency” value is 114.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)All VHs except HVHP44B, which was essentially the same as HVHP423, were expressed in 1-liter culture volumes in E. coli strain TG1 in fusion with a c-Myc-His5 tag and purified to homogeneity from periplasmic extracts by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The expression yields ranged from 1.8 to 62.1 mg of purified protein per liter of bacterial culture in shake flasks with the majority having yields of several milligrams (TABLE TWO). In the instances of HVHP423 and HVHP430, another trial under “apparently” the same expression conditions gave yields of 2.4 and 6.4 mg as opposed to 62.1 and 23.7 mg, respectively. This implies that for many of the VHs described here, optimal expression conditions should be achieved, without much effort, resulting in expression yields significantly higher than the values reported in TABLE TWO. As expected, all the VHs bound to protein A in SPR analyses, with KD values of 0.2–3 μm, a range and magnitude comparable with affinities reported previously for llama VHH variants with protein A binding activity (24Bond C.J.

All VHs were subjected to Superdex 75 gel filtration chromatography. Similar to a llama VHH, H11C7, all VHs gave a symmetric single peak at the elution volume expected for a monomer, and were essentially free of any aggregates (see the example for HVHP428 in Fig. 3A). In contrast, a typical human VH (i.e. BT32/A6) formed a considerable amount of aggregates. For three of the VHs, a minor peak with a mobility expected for a VH dimer was also observed. SPR analyses of the minor peaks gave off-rate values that were significantly slower than those for the monomer VHs, consistent with them being VH dimers. The dimer peak was also observed in the case of the llama VHH, H11C7. The folding and oligomerization states of the VHs at high concentrations were further studied by NMR spectroscopy. As shown in TABLE TWO, all the VH proteins studied appeared to be relatively soluble and assumed a well folded three-dimensional structure. One-dimensional NMR spectra of the VH fragments (Fig. 3B) showed structure folds characteristic of VH domains. The state of protein aggregation was also assessed by use of an PFG-NMR diffusion experiment for the HVHP414 fragment and two isoforms, VH14 and VH14-cMyc, with and without the c-Myc sequence, of the HVHP414. VH14 is a modified version of HVHP414 with a c-Myc N132E mutation and with an additional methionine residue at the N terminus. In brief, the PFG-NMR data (not shown) indicated that all the protein samples had expected monomeric molecular weights even at the relatively high protein concentrations used for NMR experiments.FIGURE 3Aggregation tendencies of the human VHs.

https://openalex.org/W2097779275,"Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum MCM (mtMCM) is a helicase required for DNA replication. Previous electron microscopy studies have shown mtMCM in several oligomeric forms. However, biochemical studies suggest that mtMCM is a dodecamer, likely a double hexamer (dHex). The crystal structure of the N-terminal fragment of mtMCM reveals a stable dHex architecture. To further confirm that the dHex is not an artifact of crystal packing of two hexamers, we investigated the relevance of the dHex by disrupting the hexamer-hexamer interactions seen in the crystal structure via site-directed mutagenesis and examining various biochemical activities of the mutants in vitro. Using a combination of biochemical and structural assays, we demonstrated that changing arginine to alanine at amino acid position 161 or the insertion of a six-aminoacid peptide at the hexamer-hexamer interface disrupted dHex formation and produced stable single hexamers (sHex). Furthermore, we showed that the sHex mutants retained wild-type level of ATPase and DNA binding activities but had decreased helicase activity when compared with the wild type dHex protein. These biochemical properties of mtMCM are reminiscent of those of SV40 large T antigen, suggesting that the dHex form of mtMCM may be the active helicase for DNA unwinding during the bidirectional DNA replication.

Recent research has been focused on both eukaryotic and mtMCM complex assembly and function in the DNA replication process as a replication helicase. Results of a crystallographic study have revealed that the N-terminal portion of mtMCM (N-mtMCM) assembles as a double hexamer (dHex) (11Fletcher R.J. Sclafani R. Leon R. Ogata G. Chen X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The idea that an active replication helicase has a dHex structure is intriguing. The head-to-head (N terminus to N terminus) conformation of two hexamers, as observed in the N-mtMCM dHex structure, seems awkward at first. Nevertheless, the dHex architecture may make sense from an organizational standpoint inside a cell. One might imagine a fixed point of replication where the helicase pulls double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) toward it from both directions, thereby eliminating the need to coordinate the movement of the vast number of essential proteins involved in replication. Indeed, replication foci attached to the nucleomatrix have been observed in cells (12Cook P.R. Science. 1999; 284: 1790-1795Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). A viral replicative helicase, SV40 large T antigen (LTag), is a functional homolog of the cellular MCM. LTag also functions as a helicase for unwinding replication forks. The single hexameric form (sHex) of LTag has helicase activity in vitro; however, the helicase activity of dHex is ∼10-15 times higher than that of the sHex form (13Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J.

Chem. 2002; 277: 44886-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ample evidence suggests that LTag dHex formation is essential for SV40 DNA replication (15Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Mastrangelo I.A.

Virus Res. 2000; 55: 75-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The high-resolution structures of the helicase domain of LTag reveal the presence of a large chamber inside the helicase domain with outlet side channels. These structural features, together with previous biochemical/genetic data prompted us to promote a looping model for dsDNA unwinding by LTag dHex (18Gai D. Zhao R. Li D. Finkielstein C. Chen X.

This process is triggered by ATP binding and hydrolysis. With the availability of the multiple crystal structures of LTag in different nucleotide binding states, we now have a good understanding of the mechanisms by which the ATP binding and hydrolysis trigger the conformational changes of LTag hexameric helicase that couple the energy of ATP hydrolysis to the dsDNA unwinding (18Gai D.

San Martín, submitted for publication., although a recent model for another archaeal MCM is suggested to also function as a dHex (23McGeoch A.T. Trakselis M.A. Laskey R.A. Bell S.D. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The availability of the N-mtMCM crystal structure and the detailed interactions known to occur at the hexamer-hexamer interface present a unique opportunity for investigating the in vitro biochemical activity of the dHex and sHex forms of mtMCM through structure-guided mutagenesis. Here we report the results of the mutational and functional studies. Specifically, we generated mutants designed to disrupt the hexamer-hexamer interactions and obtained stable sHex mutants. In addition, we compared the biological activities of these sHex mutants to those of the wild type (wt) dHex forms, including ATPase, DNA binding, and helicase activities. Molecular Cloning—We obtained the full-length mtMCM (FL-mtMCM) clone by inserting the PCR product of M. thermoautotrophicum ΔH MCM gene (coding residues 2-666) into a modified pGEX-2T plasmid. PCR was performed using forward primer 5′-CACAGCTCTAGAATGAAAACCGTGGATAAGAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGATGACTCGAGTTAGACTATCTTAAGGTATCCCCT-3′ with unique restriction sites XhoI and XbaI. N-mtMCM (residues 2-286) was cloned into pGEX-2T using the same forward primer as for FL-mtMCM and reverse primer 5′-CGATGACTCGAGTTACTCACGGTAGCCGTGTATGGA-3′. Arg-161 was mutated to Ala using PCR with forward primer 5′-CTGTAACCTGCAGGACGAATCCGAGTTCCTGGACACCCAGACA-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CCGTAACCTGCAGGAGCCTGAAGGATGCCCCACCACACTCTGAGCAGAGTGATGGCTC-3′, both with the unique restriction site SbfI. A six-amino-acid peptide (GSGSGG) was inserted between Cys-158 and Gly-159 using PCR with forward primer 5′-AACTAACGGCCGATCCTTCAGGCTCCTTCAGGACGAATCCGAGTTC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-AACTAACGGCCGCCACCGCTGCCGCTACCGCCACACTCTGAGCAGAGTGATGGCTCTGTGATCATGTTGGTTGA-3′, both with the unique restriction site EagII. All clones were sequenced to confirm the intended mutations. Protein Purification and Native Gel Shift Assay—All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli cells at 24 °C overnight using isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a concentration of 0.2 mm. Cell pellets were lysed by sonication in purification buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT) containing the protease inhibitors pepstatin, leupeptin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The GST-MCM fusion protein in the supernatant was purified using glutathione resin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C. The mtMCM proteins were cleaved from the glutathione S-transferase fusion using thrombin and then further purified by gel filtration FPLC using a pre-equilibrated preparation grade Superose 6 column (16/60 cm) or preparation grade Superdex-200 column (16/60 cm). Peak fractions were collected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra (Millipore) centrifuge devices and quantified first using a Bio-Rad protein assay and then by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. For native gel shift assays, 6% polyacrylamide gels were electrophoresed at 4 °C in Tris/glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 250 mm glycine) for 60 min at 200 volts. Electron Microscopy—wt and mutant N-mtMCM (100 and 250 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 250 mm NaCl, 10 mm DTT) were incubated for 1 h at 37°C. FL-mtMCM mutants were diluted to 20 μg/mlin50mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 3 mm DTT. All samples were adsorbed to glow-discharged, collodion/carbon-coated copper grids and stained with 2% uranyl acetate. Grids were examined in a JEOL 1200 EX-II transmission electron microscope at 80 kV and 60,000× magnification. Low dose micrographs on Kodak SO-163 plates were digitized in a Zeiss SCAI scanner with a pixel size of 7 μm, then binned to 21 μm (3.5 Å in the sample). Image processing was carried out with XMIPP (24Marabini R. Masegosa I.M. San Martin M.C. Marco S. Fernandez J.J. de la Fraga L.G. Vaquerizo C. Carazo J.M. J. Struct.

Biol. 2004; 148: 194-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). Manually picked particles were extracted in 64 × 64 pixel frames, normalized, centered, and aligned in two dimensions using a reference-free method (26Marco S. Chagoyen M. delaFraga G. Carazo J.M. Carrascosa J.L. Ultramicroscopy. 1996; 66: 5-10Crossref Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Classification was performed on the centered particles using neural network-based techniques (27Pascual-Montano A. Donate L.E. Valle M. Barcena M. Pascual-Marqui R.D. Carazo J.M. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 133: 233-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Images in the resulting groups were realigned before calculating averages. Two-dimensional resolution was calculated with the spectral signal to noise ratio method with the threshold set at 4 (28Unser M. Trus B.L. Steven A.C. Ultramicroscopy. 1987; 23: 39-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). 6-Fold symmetry was imposed on the end-on view average images, as this was the predominant symmetry in their rotational spectra. ATPase Assay—10-μl reactions were assembled on ice containing 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, [α-32P]ATP (Amersham, 3000 Ci/mmol), and various amount of protein. After incubation at 50 °C for 30 min, the reactions were stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA. A 5-μl aliquot from each reaction was applied to a prewashed PEI cellulose TLC plate (EMD Chemicals Inc.), dried, and run for 2 h in 2 m acetic acid and 0.5 m LiCl. Plates were dried, autoradiographed using phosphorimaging plates, and quantified. DNA Binding Assays—All primers (Operon) were resuspended in 10 mm NaOH and purified using a Mono Q 10/100 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column by FPLC. Purified DNA was concentrated and quantified using A260. For the double strand assay, complementary primers were mixed, boiled for 10 min in 900 ml of water, and allowed to cool to room temperature overnight. The annealed dsDNA was then purified using FPLC over a Superdex-75 16/60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column in 50 mm NaCl. The DNA used for the single strand binding was 5′-AAAGCGCTGACCTATCGCGTATAGCTCGAGGA-3′ and the complementary oligonucleotides used for the double strand assay were 5′-GCGCTGACCTATCGACCTATACGGTTAGCC and 5′-GGCTAACCGTATAGGTCGATAGGTCAGCGC. The primers were labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham, 3000 Ci/mmol). The labeled primer was purified using Microspin G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and stored at 4 °C. 20-μl reactions were assembled at room temperature with 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,50mm Tris, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 15 nm DNA, and various amount of mtMCM protein. Reactions were incubated at 25 °C for 30 min and then 5 μl of loading buffer (50% glycerol, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) were added. Reactions were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and electrophoresed for 1 h at 80 volts in 1× TBE buffer. Gels were dried and exposed to film and phosphorimaging plates for quantification. Helicase Assay—The helicase assay was performed essentially as described in Ref. 10Poplawski A. Grabowski B. Long S.E. Kelman Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49371-49377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar. Briefly, a 60-nucleotide primer, 5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCGCGCGGGGAGAGGCGGTTTGCGTATTGGGCGCC (Operon), was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to M13mp18 (NEB) ssDNA in a 2:1 ratio in 300 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, resulting in a 34-base-pair dsDNA region and a 26-nucleotide 3′-overhang. The dsDNA substrate was then purified using 700 μl of Sephacryl 300HR resin in a 2-ml glass column (Bio-Rad). 20-μl reactions containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.25 nm dsDNA substrate, and various amount of mtMCM protein were assembled on ice and then incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, followed by the addition of 5× stop solution (10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 50% glycerol). The reactions were electrophoresed for 50 min at 150 volts on a 12% acrylamide gel in 1× TBE on ice. The gel was dried and then exposed to film and phosphorimaging plate for quantification. Mutations, Protein Expression, and Purification—The sHex mutants that specifically disrupt dHex formation were designed based on the crystal structure of the N-mtMCM (11Fletcher R.J. Sclafani R. Leon R. Ogata G. Chen X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The interface between the two hexamers in the dHex structure of N-mtMCM is extensive and is mediated by both main chain packing and side chain interactions through the amino acids located within the zinc binding domain (Fig. 1A). One of the amino acid residues, Arg-161 (Fig. 1B), forms five hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) at the interface. Because there are 12 Arg-161 residues in a dHex complex, Arg-161 is predicted to play an important role in the hexamer-hexamer interactions. To disrupt formation of the dHex, we generated two mutants: a point mutation, R161A, and a six-amino-acid insertion mutant (6Ins) in which the amino acid sequence GSGSGG was inserted between residues Cys-158 and Gly-159. The six-amino-acid peptide in the 6Ins mutant was designed to be positioned at the interface between the two hexamers, providing a short bulge of six amino acids that should hinder the ability of Arg-161 to H-bond to the opposing hexamer, thereby achieving an effect similar to that of the R161A mutation. R161A and 6Ins were constructed not only in the context of the complete protein, FL-mtMCM, but also in the N-terminal construct, N-mtMCM, used for crystallographic studies. Because N-mtMCM alone forms dHex, the parallel mutations on N-mtMCM can provide an additional line of evidence for disruption of the dHex formation. The six constructs used for this study are listed in Fig. 1C. All six proteins were expressed and purified to near homogeneity using the conditions described herein and as shown in Fig. 2, A and B. Disruption of dHex by Mutations—To evaluate the ability of the R161A and 6Ins mutations to disrupt dHex formation in both the N-mtMCM and FL-mtMCM constructs, we used a combination of three methods, gel filtration chromatography, native gel shift, and electron microscopy (EM), to analyze the oligomeric states of the proteins. Using gel filtration chromatography, we found that the elution profile of wt N-mtMCM had a peak with an apparent molecular mass of ∼380 kDa, consistent with the size of a dodecamer (or dHex). In contrast, the elution peaks for the two mutants of N-mtMCM displayed a clear shift toward an apparent molecular mass of ∼190 kDa (Fig. 2C), consistent with the size of a hexamer. Similarly, the elution peak for FL-mtMCM had an apparent molecular mass of ∼960 kDa, consistent with a dodecamer assembly, whereas the two mutants eluted at peaks with an apparent molecular mass of ∼450-500 kDa (Fig. 2D), consistent with sHex. The identity of the proteins from all the peaks was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2, A and B). The wt proteins of both FL-mtMCM and N-mtMCM behaved as dodecamers and the mutant proteins as hexamers. To further analyze the disruption of dHex assembly in mutants, proteins from all six mtMCM constructs were subjected to a native gel shift assay. Despite the use of a wide variety of buffer and salt conditions, the three FL-mtMCM (wt and two mutants) proteins did not show a distinct band pattern on the native gel shift assays. However, the N-mtMCM constructs displayed clear band patterns in the native gel shift assays (Fig. 2E). The two mutant proteins migrated faster than the wt (Fig. 2E, lanes 1-3), suggesting that dHex assembly was disrupted. The faster migration of R161A on native gel could also be caused by the elimination of the positively charged arginine residues (6/hexamer). To examine the charge effect on native gel migration, we used another mutant with two arginine residues (Arg-227 and Arg-230) mutated to alanine as a control (Fig. 2E, lane 4). The mutations were not expected to affect dHex formation because both residues are away from the hexamer-hexamer interface. This mutant behaved like a wt dHex in gel filtration (data not shown) and migrated in a manner similar to that of the wt dHex protein in native gel (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that the loss of two arginines in one molecule (or 12/hexamer) was not sufficient to change the migration in the native gel shift assay. Thus, the faster migration of R161A is not the result of charge changes but likely because of disruption of the hexamer-hexamer interactions needed for dHex formation. We used EM to directly visualize the presence of dHex in the wt and mutant proteins for both FL-mtMCM and N-mtMCM. We will focus on the data of the N-mtMCM proteins here because the availability of the crystal structure of this construct allows the direct comparison of the EM results with the atomic model (Fig. 3). For the wt N-mtMCM, images corresponding to the side view of the dHex (Fig. 3A) and to the end-on view looking down the channel of the complex (Fig. 3B) were observed. However, for the R161A and 6Ins mutants, no dHex side images were present, and somewhat different end-on views were observed (Fig. 3, C and D). Notably, the difference in the chirality of the end-on average images of the wt and the mutants is striking (Fig. 3 compare B with C and D). The end-on view of the wt dHex has no chirality (Fig. 3B), as was the case for an end-on projection of a low pass-filtered map calculated from the dHex crystal structure (Fig. 3E). In contrast, the end-on views of the two mutants have obvious chirality (Fig. 3, C and D), similar to the chirality seen in a projection of the low pass-filtered map of a sHex atomic model from the crystal structure (Fig. 3F). Fig. 3G summarizes the presence or absence of side views and chirality in wt and mutant N-mtMCM complexes. These EM results further demonstrated that R161A and 6Ins mutants disrupted dHex formation of the mtMCM complex. ATP Hydrolysis—ATPase assays were done only with FL-mtMCM because the FL constructs contain the ATPase domain and the N-mtMCM constructs lack this domain. For this reason, the DNA binding and helicase assay described below were also performed only on the FL-mtMCM constructs. The ATPase assays showed that the two mutant FL-mtMCM proteins, R161A-FL and 6Ins-FL, were capable of hydrolyzing ATP (Fig. 4A). Quantification of the assays (Fig. 4B) revealed no significant difference in ATP hydrolysis between the wt and the two mutants. DNA Binding—The assays of ssDNA and dsDNA binding showed that the mutant FL-mtMCM proteins bound DNA over a range of protein concentrations (Fig. 5, A and B), and quantification of the assays revealed a similar level of DNA binding activity for the wt and the sHex mutants (Fig. 5, C and D). Helicase Assay—When we examined the helicase activity of the wt and sHex mutants of the FL-mtMCM, all showed helicase activity (Fig. 6A). However, the sHex mutants consistently exhibited lower helicase activity than wt protein at multiple protein concentrations (Fig. 6B). The activity difference was the greatest at 0.5 nm protein concentration, where both mutants had minimal level of activity (∼1.2% released the ssDNA, Fig. 6B), but the wt showed ∼13 times higher activity (with ∼16% released ssDNA, Fig. 6B). The difference between mutant and wt helicase activity decreased as the protein concentrations increased over the range between 0.5 and 8.0 nm (Fig. 6B), with up to 5 times lower activity for mutant R161A-FL and up to 2 times lower for mutant 6Ins-FL when compared with the wt helicase activity. The R161A mutation appeared to have a greater effect on helicase activity than the 6Ins, perhaps because of the flexibility of the peptide (GSGSGG) inserted at the hexamer-hexamer interface. By a combination of mutagenesis and biochemical and structural assays, the results in this report unequivocally confirm for the first time that the hexamer-hexamer interactions seen in the x-ray dHex structure of mtMCM is not a crystal packing artifact and that the dHex architecture is functionally relevant. These results are consistent with prior observations that wt mtMCM behaved as an oligomeric complex of dHexs or dodecamers in solution (7Shechter D. Ying C. Gautier J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15049-15059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Chong J. Hayashi M. Simon M. Xu R. Stillman B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 792-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or single hexamer (30Pape T. Meka H. Chen S. Vicentini G. van Heel M. Onesti S. EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) observed in previous EM studies may not be the natural oligomeric state under physiological conditions. Using gel filtration chromatography, native gel shift analysis, and EM, we have demonstrated that the mutations of R161A and 6Ins of both the FL-mtMCM and the N-mtMCM constructs disrupted dHex formation and generated sHex complex. The sHexs of the mutant proteins were stable in solution. Interestingly, residue Arg-161 is not a highly conserved residue among other archaeal MCMs, which could explain why no other archaeal MCMs have been shown to behave like a dHex in solution. Previous EM studies of the mtMCM protein complex did not observe dHex structure, but only showed heptamer, hexamer, and polymers (22Chen Y.J. Yu X. Kasiviswanathan R. Shin J.H. Kelman Z. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Yu X. VanLoock M.S. Poplawski A. Kelman Z. Xiang T. Tye B.K. Egelman E.H.

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 1079-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Using EM, we have also detected oligomeric forms of 6- and 7-fold rings and an occasional open ring structure. 3Y. Gómez-Llorente, R. Fletcher, X. Chen, J. Carazo, and C. San Martín, submitted for publication. However, we consistently observed dodecamer (dHex) formation in a variety of salt and protein concentrations as assayed using native gel shift, gel filtration chromatography, and by direct EM observation. Moreover, the dHex structure accounted for a large portion of the images detected by EM in those buffers closest to physiological conditions (50-100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8.0) 3Y. Gómez-Llorente, R. Fletcher, X. Chen, J. Carazo, and C. San Martín, submitted for publication.. Using gel filtration chromatography, we obtained the pure FL-mtMCM proteins either from the peak corresponding to dHex form for the wt construct or from the peak corresponding to sHex form for the mutant constructs (Fig. 2, C and D). These isolated pure complexes remained in the sHex and dHex peaks, respectively, in a second run of gel filtration analysis. These isolated sHex and dHex complexes were used for functional assays. We found no significant differences in ATPase activity and DNA binding between the sHex mutants and the wt protein. This result is not necessarily surprising, because the ATP binding sites are in the helicase domain, distal to the hexamer-hexamer interface, and the DNA binding areas are located inside the hexameric channel (11Fletcher R.J. Sclafani R. Leon R. Ogata G. Chen X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The helicase activity assay revealed that the wt dHex and mutant sHex proteins were all capable of unwinding dsDNA. However, the two sHex mutants consistently displayed lower helicase activity over the range of the tested protein concentrations. The helicase activity difference was the most dramatic at a lower protein concentration of 0.5 nm, at which the wt protein has ∼13 times higher helicase activity than either of the two mutants (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, SV40 LTag, the viral functional homologue of the MCM complex, also exhibits helicase activity in vitro both as sHex and dHex complexes, and the in vitro helicase activity of the single hexamers is ∼10-15 times less than that of the dHex form (13Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8676-8681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Alexandrov A.I. Botchan M.R. Cozzarelli N.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44886-44897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, LTag dHex formation has been shown to be essential for DNA replication in vivo (15Smelkova N.V. Borowiec J.A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 8766-8773Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The determination of whether the dHex structure and the hexamer-hexamer interactions play an essential role for mtMCM function in DNA replication will require in vivo studies. The in vitro helicase assay also revealed that the two mutants, R161A-FL and 6Ins-FL, had different helicase activity. Mutant R161A-FL consistently displayed lower helicase activity than mutant 6Ins-FL at protein concentrations equal to or above 1.0 nm (Fig. 6B). Because neither mutant could form dHex, we reasoned that the lower helicase activity of R161A could be because of a role of residue Arg-161 beyond mediation of the hexamer-hexamer interaction. An alternative explanation is that mutation of R161A more efficiently disrupts dHex formation than 6Ins. The inserted string of glycine and serine residues was designed to disrupt the hexamer-hexamer interaction but not the protein folding. The flexible nature of the peptide could allow certain forms of hexamer-hexamer interaction. Another noteworthy observation is that the helicase activity of the mutants approached to that of the wt at higher protein concentration (e.g. at 8.0 nm). A convenient speculation is that at higher protein concentration the sHexs of the mutants might come together to form hexamers to give the higher helicase activity. Unfortunately, we could not use much higher mtMCM protein concentrations for a further helicase activity test, because the higher protein concentration of the wt and mutant proteins started to inhibit the helicase activity, a phenomenon also observed for SV40 large T antigen helicase. In summary, we successfully generated sHex mutants through structure-guided mutagenesis. Studies of the biochemical activities of the sHex mutants with the wt dHex proteins revealed that they had similar ATPase and DNA binding activities but that the sHex mutants had lower helicase activity than the wt dHex protein. These biochemical results, together other structural and biochemical data (7Shechter D. Ying C. Gautier J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2028191700,"An interesting property of certain peptides presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules is their acquisition of a dual binding mode within the peptide binding groove. Using x-ray crystallography at 1.4 A resolution, we show here that the glucagon receptor-derived self-peptide pGR (412RRRWHRWRL420) is presented by the disease-associated human MHC class I subtype HLA-B*2705 in a dual conformation as well, with the middle of the peptide bent toward the floor of the peptide binding groove of the molecule in both binding modes. The conformations of pGR are compared here with those of another self-peptide (pVIPR, RRKWRRWHL) that is also displayed in two binding modes by HLA-B*2705 antigens and with that of the viral peptide pLMP2 (RRRWRRLTV). Conserved structural features suggest that the N-terminal halves of the peptides are crucial in allowing cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) cross-reactivity. In addition, an analysis of T cell receptors (TCRs) from pGR- or pVIPR-directed, HLA-B27-restricted CTL clones demonstrates that TCR from distinct clones but with comparable reactivity may share CDR3α but not CDR3β regions. Therefore, the cross-reactivity of these CTLs depends on TCR-CDR3α, is modulated by TCR-CDR3β sequences, and is ultimately a consequence of the conformational dimorphism that characterizes binding of the self-peptides to HLA-B*2705. These results lend support to the concept that conformational dimorphisms of MHC class I-bound peptides might be connected with the occurrence of self-reactive CTL."
https://openalex.org/W2076262897,"N-Linked glycans have been shown to have an important role in the cell biology of a variety of cell surface glycoproteins, including PrP protein. It has been suggested that glycosylation of PrP can influence the susceptibility to transmissible spongiform encephalopathy and determine the characteristics of the many different strains observed in this particular type of disease. To understand the role of carbohydrates in influencing the PrP maturation, stability, and cell biology, we have produced and analyzed gene-targeted murine models expressing differentially glycosylated PrP. Transgenic mice carrying the PrP substitution threonine for asparagine 180 (G1) or threonine for asparagine 196 (G2) or both mutations combined (G3), which eliminate the first, second, and both glycosylation sites, respectively, have been generated by double replacement gene targeting. An in vivo analysis of altered PrP has been carried out in transgenic mouse brains, and our data show that the lack of glycans does not influence PrP maturation and stability. The presence of one chain of sugar is sufficient for the trafficking to the cell membrane, whereas the unglycosylated PrP localization is mainly intracellular. However, this altered cellular localization of PrP does not lead to any overt phenotype in the G3 transgenic mice. Most importantly, we found that, in vivo, unglycosylated PrP does not acquire the characteristics of the aberrant pathogenic form (PrPSc), as was previously reported using in vitro models.

Glycoproteins are subject to a number of post-translational modifications as they pass through the secretory pathway. During polypeptide chain synthesis, N-glycosylation is initiated by the transfer of core glycans to target asparagines. Processing of core glycans into the complex type is then achieved in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) 4The abbreviations used are: ERendoplasmic reticulumBSAbovine serum albuminESembryonic stemFFIfatal familial insomniaGPIglycosylphosphatidylinositolPBSphosphate-buffered salinePIPLCphosphatidylinositol phospholipase CPKproteinase KTSEtransmissible spongiform encephalopathyPMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. and Golgi apparatus compartments (1Helenius A.

Whereas its normal function has yet to be defined, expression of PrP is essential for the development of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) or prion disease (6Bueler H. Aguzzi A. Sailer A.

The TSEs are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that can be sporadic, inherited, or acquired by infection. TSE diseases include scrapie of sheep and goats, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and a number of human forms of the disease such as Creutzfeldt-Jackob disease, variant Creutzfeldt-Jackob disease linked with bovine spongiform encephalopathy, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, Kuru, and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) (8Will R.G.

A central event in all prion diseases appears to be a conformational modification of the normal cellular prion protein (PrPC) from a soluble form with a predominant α-helical conformation to the pathogenic form (PrPSc) that is aggregated, rich in β-sheets, partially resistant to proteinase K digestion, and insoluble in nondenaturing detergents (11Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5155) Google Scholar). PrP contains two N-glycan attachment sequences (NXT) at amino acids 180 and 196 in mice. These sites are variably glycosylated in vivo such that un-, mono-, and diglycosylated glycotypes are observed (12Stimson E. Hope J. Chong A. Burlingame A.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4885-4895Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 13Rudd P.M. Endo T. Colominas C. Groth D. Wheeler S.F. Harvey D.J. Wormald M.R. Serban H. Prusiner S.B. Kobata A.

The biological significance of each of the glycotypes of PrP (un-, mono-, and diglycosylated) is unknown. Both N-glycosylation sites are conserved in the PrP gene (Prnp) from all species, suggesting that N-glycans play an important role in the protein function (14van Rheede T. Smolenaars M.M. Madsen O. de Jong W.W. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2003; 20: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). A number of reports have shown that the lack of sugars can induce the PrPC to PrPSc transition in vitro, suggesting that perturbations in glycosylation may contribute to the development of disease, destabilizing PrP structure and allowing it to acquire spontaneously PrP-like properties (15Kocisko D.A.

To investigate the in vivo effect of glycosylation on PrP biochemical properties and its cellular biology, we have developed a gene-targeted transgenic model in which the host Prnp is replaced by a modified Prnp transgene in the correct genomic location (23Manson J.C. Tuzi N.L. Exp. Rev. Mol. Med. 2001; http://www.expertreviews.org/01002952h.htmPubMed Google Scholar). This model represents a valid tool to analyze the effect of mutations of the host Prnp in TSE susceptibility, since the Prnp gene expression is controlled by the normal regulatory elements of endogenous PrP (24Moore R.C.

Three transgenic lines have been generated, each containing a point mutation in the Prnp gene eliminating the first, second, or both of the glycosylation sites: N180T (G1), N196T (G2), and N180T-N196T (G3). Using these mice, we have investigated whether the lack of glycans can alter the expression level of the PrP protein, its conformation and intracellular localization, and its ability to acquire the biochemical characteristics of the pathogenic form. We report here that whereas glycans appear to control the cellular location of PrP, the presence of sugars does not dramatically change the biology of PrP, and there is no evidence of PrPSc-like properties in either mono- or unglycosylated PrP. The results reported here are important in determining the physiological function of PrP glycoforms and in understanding their role in the infectious and pathogenic process of TSEs. Mouse monoclonal antibody 8H4, epitope (residues 145–220) binding is independent of the N-linked glycosylation, because it reacts with both recombinant PrP and all native glycoforms (29Zanusso G. Liu D. Ferrari S. Hegyi I. Yin X. Aguzzi A. Hornemann S. Liemann S. Glockshuber R. Manson J.C. Brown P. Petersen R.B. Gambetti P. Sy M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FH11 is a mouse monoclonal antibody that binds the N-terminal region of PrP and is used extensively in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (31Foster J.D. Wilson M. Hunter N. Vet. Rec. 1996; 139: 512-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). AG4 is a mouse monoclonal antibody with epitope recognition between residues 31 and 51, with a further area of binding between amino acids 147 and 163. 1B3 and 1A8 are both rabbit polyclonal antibodies against PrP. Rat monoclonal anti-tubulin antibody (Abcam) has been used as loading control in Western blot experiments. Alexa Fluor ® 488 and Alexa Fluor ® 568 are IgG-labeled with fluorescent dye (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Rabbit anti-cow glial fibrillary acidic protein (DAKO) is an antibody recognizing a specific astrocytic marker. The endoplasmic reticulum marker anti-ERp60 is raised in rabbit against porcine ERp60 peptide PIIQEEKPKKKKKAQEDL in the C terminus of the protein (32Rouiller I. Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Windsor M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2373-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Golgi marker 23C rat monoclonal, IgG2c, clone 23c was raised in rats against recombinant mouse TCP-1α, C-terminal half (33Willison K. Lewis V. Zuckerman K.S. Cordell J. Dean C. Miller K. Lyon M.F. Marsh M. Cell. 1989; 57: 621-632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PrP codon 180 and 196 alterations were introduced into HM-1 embryonic stem (ES) cells. Briefly, a gene-targeting vector was constructed using isogenic 129/Ola Prnpa DNA from a HM-1 genomic library in λ DASH II (Stratagene). The PrP codon 180 and 196 alterations were introduced into a 1.1-kb XmaIII-EcoRI exon 3 fragment containing the open reading frame by the Kunkel method (34Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). This was ligated with the 5′ and 3′ homologous sequences derived from a 7.8-kb BamHI-EcoRV genomic clone spanning 129/OlaPrnp exon 3. A LoxPneomycin/thymidine kinase-selectable cassette (provided by Alan Clarke, University of Cardiff, UK) was ligated into a unique SalI site 1600 bases downstream of exon 3 in the pBluescript plasmid (Stratagene). The pBluescript vector previously had its SalI site removed, so this was a unique site in the targeting vector. The open reading frame encoding PrP in the targeting vector was sequenced at each step in the cloning procedure to confirm the presence of the alterations and the absence of any other cloning artifacts. Culture conditions for the ES cell line HM-1 have been described previously (35Selfridge J. Pow A.M. McWhir J. Magin T.M. Melton D.W. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1992; 18: 325-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). HM-1 cells (5 × 107) were electroporated using a gene pulser (Bio-Rad) at 800 V and 3 millifarads with 250 μg of linearized targeting vector DNA in 0.8 ml of Hepes-phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.05. Cells were rested for 15 min and plated at 5 × 105/10-cm plate. 24–48 h after electroporation, G418 selection medium was added. Medium was changed every 2–3 days, and colonies were selected for PCR screening 15 days after electroporation. 107 targeted HM-1 cells in 0.8 ml of serum-free growth medium were electroporated with 25 μg of the plasmid pCre2 (provided by Alan Clarke). Two pulses of 230 V, 500 microfarads were given. Cells were rested for 15 min and plated at 104 cell/10-cm plate. On day 6 after electroporation, 2 mm gancylovir was added to the growth medium. Colonies were picked and screened on day 15. Half of the cells from surviving colonies were used to prepare DNA for all PCR analyses Detection of Homologous Recombination Events—A 1600-bp PCR product was synthesized between the neomycin/thymidine kinase cassette and a site outside the targeting vector. The reaction-specific oligonucleotides are LoxP, situated immediately upstream of the 3′ loxP site (TCGATCGACTAGAGCTTGCGGA), and 3′Map1, located 200 bases 3′ to the EcoRV site (CTAAGTGACCTAGGCACATGTC). The cycle conditions were 3 min at 94 °C and then 35 cycles of 1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C, and 2 min at 72 °C and then 10 min at 72 °C (GeneAmp 9700; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Those positive for the selection cassette were then analyzed for the glycosylation mutation using the mismatch-specific PCR reaction described below for genotyping. Removal of the Selectable Marker—The removal of the selectable marker left one LoxP site. This is screened for using oligonucleotides 5′ and 3′ to the PrP gene SalI site NLTVitro creA (AGAACAGGTCTGACCACACTGGTT) and NLTVitro creB (AATGGTTAAACTTTCGTTAAGGAT). Wild type PrP alleles will give a PCR product of 242 bp, whereas those containing a loxP site will be 342 bp. Sites containing an unexcised neomycin/thymidine kinase cassette would be over 5 kb. The cycle conditions were 3 min at 94 °C and then 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 °C, 45 s at 60 °C, and 45 s at 72 °C and then 10 min at 72 °C. Targeted ES cells were used to generate chimeric mice as described previously (25Manson J.C. Jamieson E. Baybutt H. Tuzi N.L. Barron R. McConnell I. Somerville R. Ironside J. Will R. Sy M.S. Melton D.W. Hope J. Bostock C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6855-6864Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) to obtain G1 and G2 heterozygous mice expressing mono- and unglycosylated PrP and G3 heterozygous mice expressing unglycosylated PrP. Heterozygous mice were bred to produce an inbred homozygous line. 129/Ola mice were used as wild type controls, since the had been generated on a 129/Ola background. NPU PrP–/– mice (7Manson J.C. Clarke A.R. Hooper M.L. Aitchison L. McConnell I. Hope J. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 8: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar) were used as negative controls in all of the experiments performed. G1 and G2 mutant alleles were detected using a mismatch PCR technique. An oligonucleotide mixture was used at 1 pmol that contained a forward oligonucleotide 9910 (AACCTCAAGCATGTGGCAGGGGCTGCGGCAGCTGG), a reverse oligonucleotide 9912 (TCAGTGCCAGGGGTATTAGCCTATGGGGGACACAG), and a mutant-specific or wild type oligonucleotide (also in the reverse orientation) in a ratio of 20:1:20. The reaction-specific oligonucleotides are G1-mut (GCTGCTTGATGGTGATAG), G1-WT (GCTGCTTGATGGTGATAT), G2-mut (CATCGGTCTCGGTGAAGG), and G2-WT (CATCGGTCTCGGTGAAGT) (mutated nucleotides are in boldface type). The cycle conditions were 3 min at 94 °C and then 35 cycles of 50 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 60 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C and then 10 min at 72 °C. All other reaction components were those recommended by the supplier (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA was prepared using a Puregene Isolation kit (Gentra Systems). DNA (15 mg/reaction) was digested with restriction enzymes and then separated on a 1% agarose gel and blotted to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization was performed using ULTAhyb solution (Ambion) using a 700-bp EcoRV-BamHI fragment (3′ probe) and an 884-bp PCR product as probes. Following stringent wash procedures (0.1× SSC at 65 °C), the blots were exposed to x-ray film for 2 days. Total RNA was isolated using RNAzolTM B (Biogenesis) based on the guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (36Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63196) Google Scholar). A 20-μg aliquot of total RNA was separated on a 1.0% agarose-formaldehyde denaturing gel, transferred to Hybond N (Amersham Biosciences), and probed with a 32P-labeled 936-bp KpnI-EcoRI fragment from exon 3 of Prnp. Mice were killed by cervical dislocation, and brains were removed, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and then stored at –70 °C until required. Half or whole brains were weighed and mechanically homogenized from frozen in nine volumes of ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet 40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5) with the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) (final concentration 1 μm; Sigma) to prevent protein degradation by endogenous proteases. The homogenate was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min to remove debris. Total protein was denatured in 1× Novex Tris/glycine SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and 1× NuPage sample-reducing agent (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 95 °C. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis at 125 V through a Novex precast Tris/glycine gel (12 or 14% acrylamide, Tris/glycine; Invitrogen). Proteins in the acrylamide gel were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 25 V (125 A/gel) using a semidry transfer blotter (Bio-Rad) in 1× transfer solution (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glycine, 0.375% SDS, 20% methanol). Total brain proteins (5% brain homogenate, Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were denatured in 1× glycoprotein denaturing buffer (0.5% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol; New England Biolabs) at 100 °C for 10 min prior to incubation with Peptide N-glycosidase F (30,000 units/ml; New England Biolabs) in 1% Nonidet 40 (New England Biolabs) and 1× G7 reaction buffer (50 mm NaPO4; New England Biolabs) at 37 °C for 2–4 h. The reaction was terminated by freezing at –20 °C or SDS denaturation. Mouse brain homogenates (10%) were prepared in ice-cold Nonidet P-40 buffer. Each homogenate was then split into two aliquots, one treated with proteinase K (PK; Roche Applied Science) and one not. In order to assess the sensitivity to enzyme digestion, wild type, G1, G2, and G3 brain homogenates were each treated with varying concentrations of PK: 20, 10, and 5 μg/ml at 37 °C for 1 h. A milder treatment was also carried out, incubating the samples with PK (20 μg/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h. The samples were then analyzed by Western blotting using 8H4 or 7A12 monoclonal antibodies for PrP detection. The method is an adaptation of that of Barnard et al. (37Barnard G. Helmick B. Madden S. Gilbourne C. Patel R. Luminescence. 2000; 15: 357-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PrPC was extracted from brain homogenate (10– 1 tissue, Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by mechanical homogenization in 1 m guanidine hydrochloride (25 mm Tris, 1 m guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma); 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma)). This was then diluted in DELFIA ® assay buffer (Tris-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (BSA), bovine γ-globulins, Tween 40, diethylenetiaminepentacetic acid (PerkinElmer), leading to a final concentration equivalent to of 10 mg/ml original tissue. Capture antibodies FH11 (1:200) or AG4 (1:200) were bound to 96-well plates by overnight incubation at 4 °C. Wells were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin (Roche Applied Science) in sterile 1× PBS (Oxoid) with 3 m NaN3, for 1 h shaking at room temperature. The plate was then incubated with samples and standards, shaken at room temperature for 1 h, and then incubated with europium (Eu3+)-labeled detector antibodies 7A12 (FH11 or AG4 captures) or 8H4 (1:3000) (FH11 capture only). DELFIA ® enhancement solution was added to the samples to facilitate the formation of Eu-(2-NTA)3(TOPO)2–3. After 5 min of shaking at room temperature, Eu3+ emission (615 nm) was calculated using a time-resolved technique. Between each step, the plate was washed in 1× DELFIA ® wash concentrate (TBST; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) using the DELFIA ® automatic plate washer (Wallace). The program WorkOut was used to analyze absorbance from standard and samples and to produce the standard curve (based on a linear model of emission). PrPC was extracted from brain homogenate (10–1 tissue; Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer; 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by mechanical homogenization in 1 m guanidine hydrochloride (25 mm Tris, 1 m guanidine hydrochloride (Sigma); 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma)). This was then diluted in DELFIA ® assay buffer, leading to a final concentration equivalent to of 10 mg/ml of original tissue. Proteins insoluble in 1 m guanidine hydrochloride (PrPSc) were separated from those that were soluble (PrPC) by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride prior to dilution in DELFIA ® assay buffer, to a concentration equivalent to 10 mg/ml original tissue. Measurement of the sample concentration was then performed as described above (DELFIA ® analysis). Mouse brain homogenates (10%) were prepared by homogenizing in ice-cold PBS containing 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Each sample was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of cold PBS, and then each sample was split. One half was treated with phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C (PIPLC; 0.5 units/ml; Sigma), whereas the second remained untreated. The samples were incubated for 10 h at 4 °C. Samples were then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (membrane-released fraction) and the pellet (membrane-associated fraction) were analyzed by Western blotting using the monoclonal antibody 8H4. A group of 10 homozygous G3 mice were monitored up to 850 days and compared with a group of wild type mice. The animals were age- and sex-matched. Animals were monitored constantly by a group of independent observers for any neurodegenerative signs. Between 800 and 900 days, mice were culled. Brains were retained; half of the brain was fixed for standard lesion profiling and plaque analysis, and the other half was flash frozen for biochemical analysis. Brain Sections were hematoxylin and eosin-stained and scored for vacuolar degeneration on a scale of 0 to 5 in nine standard gray matter areas and three standard white matter areas as described previously (38Fraser H. Dickinson A.G. Nature. 1967; 216: 1310-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Sections were immunostained using standard procedures. Briefly, sections were blocked with normal goat serum and probed overnight with polyclonal antibody anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein at a dilution of 1:400. A parallel panel of sections was also probed with normal mouse serum as a control. Antibody binding was detected with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson) and the Vectastain Elite ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories). Reaction products were visualized with diaminobenzidine, and sections were lightly counterstained with hematoxylin. Pictures were taken using a Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope. Mouse brains were fixed in periodate/lysine/paraformaldehyde or in a paraformaldehyde/glutaraldehyde mix (4% paraformaldehyde, 0.025% glutaraldehyde) for 4 h. Brain sections were cut at a thickness of 70 μm using a vibrating microtome (Leica). The sections were permeabilized for 1 h in PBS, 0.1% Triton at room temperature before blocking overnight at room temperature in PBS, 0.5% BSA in a humid chamber. Sections were blocked for a further 1 h at 37°C in Mouse On Mouse Ig blocking reagent/PBS when mouse monoclonal antibodies were used (Vector Laboratories). After blocking, the tissues were incubated at 37 °C with primary antibody (diluted in PBS/protein concentrate when mouse monoclonals were used; Vector Laboratories) for 90 min (39Monaghan P. Watson P.R. Cook H. Scott L. Wallis T.S. Robertson D. J. Microsc. 2001; 203: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To get a specific signal, several anti-PrP antibodies were used at different concentrations: 8H4 (1:1000 and 1:2000), AG4 (1:1000 and 1:2000), 1B3 (1:800, 1:1000, and 1:2000), and 1A8 (1:1000 and 1:2000). After extensive washes in a calcium/magnesium-free PBS solution, the sections were incubated at 37 °C with the secondary antibody goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor ® 488 conjugate diluted 1:200 in PBS/BSA for 90 min. The samples were then washed with a calcium/magnesium-free PBS solution for 20 min and then stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole nuclear marker (1:10,000; Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. After extensive washes in ultrapure water, the sections were mounted for microscopic analysis. Co-localization experiments were carried out using the same basic method as above with some modifications. For ERp60/8H4 (1:400 and 1:500), the primary antibodies were mixed in PBS/BSA so that the tissue was incubated with them simultaneously. Similarly, the secondary antibodies, Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies and Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, were simultaneously incubated. Controls for cross-reactivity were used, and none was detected. For 23C/8H4, cross-reactivity was detected; to eliminate it, a sequential staining method was used. Sections were first incubated with 8H4 (1:500) diluted in PBS/protein concentrate (Vector Laboratories), washed in PBS, and then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse using a method identical to that for single 8H4 labeling. Sections were then washed 10 times in PBS before being blocked for 1 h in MOM Ig-blocking reagent (Vector Laboratories). Block was removed by washing for 10 min in PBS/protein concentrate before incubation of the section with 23C (1:50) in PBS/protein concentrate. The sections were then washed and incubated with Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-rat. The sections were washed, stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and mounted for analysis. Sections were imaged with a Leica TCS SP2 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Construction of Gene-targeted Mice with Altered N-Linked Glycosylation of PrP—Using the Cre-loxP recombination and gene-targeting approaches, three inbred lines of transgenic mice with alterations in the N-linked glycosylation consensus sites Asn-Xaa-Thr were generated. Gene targeting was used to alter the Asn residue to Thr at 180 (N180T), 196 (N196T), or both 180 and 196 (N180T/N196T) (Fig. 1) in the HM-1 ES cell line. The positive ES clones were subsequent"

A low density subfraction of these vesicles (MV1), highly enriched in phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), is required for nuclear envelope formation. Membrane fusion of MV1 with a second fraction that contributes most of the nuclear envelope can be initiated without GTP by an exogenous bacterial PtdIns-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) which hydrolyzes PtdIns to form diacylglycerides and inositol 1-phosphate.

Large unilammelar vesicles (LUVs) enriched in PtdIns can substitute for MV1 in PI-PLC induced nuclear envelope formation. Moreover, MV1 prehydrolyzed with PI-PLC and washed to remove inositols leads to spontaneous nuclear envelope formation with MV2 without further PI-PLC treatment. LUVs enriched in diacylglycerol mimic prehydrolyzed MV1.

At the end of each mitosis in eukaryotes, the nuclear envelope is typically reconstituted by membrane fusion, forming the nuclear compartment and segregating the chromosomes from the cytoplasm. A similar process encloses sperm chromatin in egg cytoplasm following fertilization. A number of studies emphasizing the role of proteins have addressed the mechanism of nuclear envelope assembly, many utilizing cell-free systems derived from eggs or somatic cells (1Lohka M. Masui Y. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1222-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 2Burke B. Gerace L. Cell. 1986; 44: 639-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 3Ulitzur N.

However, relatively little attention has been paid to the essential role(s) played by membrane lipids in this process. Male pronuclear or somatic nuclear envelope formation involves binding of nuclear membrane precursors to the chromatin surface followed by fusion to create a double membrane enclosing the chromatin (1Lohka M.

We have previously reported that envelope formation in a cell-free system derived from sea urchin eggs requires the fusion of three egg membrane vesicle populations and remnants of the sperm nuclear envelope at the tip and base of the conical nucleus (8Collas P.

It is a low density fraction highly enriched in the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Larijani B. Poccia D.L. Dickinson L.C. Lipids. 2000; 35: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MV1 binds at the tip and base of the sperm nucleus and is required for nuclear envelope formation, which can be induced by addition of GTP or a bacterial PtdIns-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The endogenous sea urchin PI-PLC activity probably resembles a typical eukaryotic enzyme whose substrate is PtdIns(4,5)P2. GTP-initiated envelope formation is inhibited by GTPγS and by the PI 3-kinase inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002 (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem.

Initiation of the fusion process by exogenous bacterial PI-PLC or human recombinant PI-PLCγ can be inhibited by the PI-PLC inhibitors ET-18-OCH3 or U73122 (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L.

PtdIns hydrolysis is best known as an intermediate step in G-protein signaling pathways in which PtdIns(4,5)P2 is hydrolyzed by PI-PLC to form diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate (InsP3). Typically, such signaling occurs in membranes containing 3-10% PtdIns with much lower amounts of PtdIns(4,5)P2 (15Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar). However, the large amount of PtdIns present in MV1 (up to 80% of the phospholipid) suggested to us that the PtdIns hydrolysis may be important in altering membrane structure rather than in initiating a signaling pathway (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Since MV1 binds to the tip and base of the nucleus, hydrolysis at these points might lead to fusion initiation through localized formation of DAG. The hydrolysis products of PtdIns catalyzed by the bacterial PI-PLC are diglycerides (normally DAG) and inositol 1-phosphate (from the intermediate d-myo-inositol-1,2-cyclic phosphate) (16Griffith O.H. Ryan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). DAG produced enzymatically by phospholipases acting on synthetic membranes has been shown to be membrane destabilizing and induce membrane fusion (17Basanez G. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Alonso A. Goni F. Karlsson G. Edwards K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2630-2637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 18Nieva J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A.

We show here that under fusion-stimulating conditions, bacterial PI-PLC treatment of sea urchin egg membranes results in large increases of a small subset of diradylglyceride (diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, and alkenylacylglycerol) molecular species, in particular, DAG 18:0/20:4. To test whether fusion of natural membranes induced by PI-PLC in our cell-free system might result from localized production of DAG, we took two complementary approaches. First, MV1 was hydrolyzed with PI-PLC and washed to remove the water-soluble inositol products. The resulting prehydrolyzed MV1 when added to a cell-free system containing other nuclear envelope precursor MVs and cytosol led to nuclear envelope formation with no added inducer. Second, we used synthetic large unilamellar membrane vesicles (LUVs) to substitute for MV1 and varied the phospholipid composition of these membranes. LUVs containing 75% PtdIns mimicked MV1. In the presence of cytosol these LUVs bound to the tips of nuclei and initiated fusion when exogenous PI-PLC was added. Furthermore, LUVs containing 75% DAG led to fusion without exogenously added PI-PLC, mimicking prehydrolyzed MV1. These results indicate that production of substantial amounts of diglycerides from the PtdIns of MV1 can lead to nuclear envelope formation and offer a possible role for PtdIns-rich membranes in local initiation of nuclear envelope formation. Buffers and Reagents—Egg lysis buffer (LB), nuclear preparation buffer, membrane wash buffer (MWB), and Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, buffer (TN) were prepared as previously described (21Collas P. Poccia D. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 417-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Lytechinus pictus and Paracentrotus lividus (sea urchins) were obtained from Marinus (Long Beach, CA) and Universidade Lusófona, Portugal, respectively (L. pictus was used for all experiments unless otherwise stated). The ATP generation system was 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, and 1 mg/ml creatine kinase (Type I), all from Sigma in LB. GTP (Sigma, Type II) stock was 1 mm in LB buffer. The stock of lipophilic membrane probe 3,3′-dihexylocarbocyanine iodide (DiOC6) from Molecular Probes was 0.1 mg/ml in methanol. Synaptojanin1 (Syn1-5ptase) phosphatase construct (S470-R962; lacking the Sac phosphatase and proline-rich domains) from R. Woscholski (Imperial College London). PI-PLC from Bacillus cereus was from Sigma. PI-PLC stocks (3.14 units/ml) were made by dissolving 0.8 mg in 1 ml of 144 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 0.02% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 600 μl of glycerol were added, and aliquots were stored up to 1 month at 4 °C. 1-O-Octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine (ET-18-OCH3) stock solution was 9.6 mm dissolved in Me2SO, aliquoted, and stored at -20 °C up to 3 months. Lipids for LUVs were d-myo-phosphatidylinositol (Di-C16) from Echelon, egg yolk dioleoylglycerol (Grade 1) from Lipid Products, and 1,2-dipalmitoleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine from Avanti Polar Lipids. Lipid Extraction of Cytoplasmic Membrane Vesicles Hydrolyzed with PI-PLC—MV0 from P. lividus was isolated from 1 ml of S10 and resuspended in 400 μl of LB. The suspension was divided into two equal parts and either left untreated or treated with 0.16 unit/ml bacterial PI-PLC for 2 h at room temperature. Total lipids were extracted from each using a modified Folch procedure (11Larijani B. Poccia D.L. Dickinson L.C. Lipids. 2000; 35: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). An internal standard mix containing 12:0/12:0 species of DAG, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylserine (500 ng each) was added to each sample followed by 1.5 ml of methanol. Chloroform (3 ml) was then added to each, and samples were mixed and left for 10 min. To split the phases, 1.5 ml of 0.88% KCl was added. The upper aqueous phase was removed and the lower organic phase containing total lipids was dried under a stream of nitrogen, dissolved in 150 μl chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v), transferred into a silanized autosampler vial insert, dried again on a rotary vacuum evaporator, and dissolved in 15 μl of chloroform. LC-MS Separation of Diradylglycerols (DRGs)—Isolation of diradylglycerols (diacylglycerol, alkylacylglycerol, and alkenylacylglycerol) was by gradient separation on a Luna silica column (3 μm, 1.0 × 150 mm; Phenomenex) using 100% chloroform/hexane/propan-2-ol/water (30: 70:1.5:0.025), held for 3 min, then changed to 100% acetonitrile/chloroform/methanol/water (30:30:35:5) containing 5 mm ethylamine over the next 37 min at 100 μl/min. Post-column addition of 10 mm ammonium formate in methanol at 50 μl/min was required for diradylglycerol ionization. The 1,2-diradylglycerols eluted at 2-2.5 min were detected as sodiated adducts ([M + Na]+) by positive electrospray ionization on a Shimadzu QP8000α single quadrapole MS (probe voltage, 1 kV; nebulizer gas, 4 liters/min N2; curved desolvation line temperature, 275 °C). Sperm Nuclei Permeabilization, Fertilized Egg Extracts, and MV Preparation—Sperm nuclei of L. pictus were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 as described previously (21Collas P. Poccia D. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 417-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Demembranated nuclei were washed and resuspended at 108 nuclei/ml. Nuclei were diluted 1:25 and added to egg extracts to a final ratio of approximately one sperm nucleus per egg equivalent. Eggs and sperm were collected and eggs fertilized as described (21Collas P. Poccia D. Methods Cell Biol. 1998; 53: 417-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fertilized eggs were washed twice in Millipore HAWP-filtered sea water at 100 × g for 1 min in a 5403 Eppendorf swinging bucket microcentrifuge at 15 °C. At 13 min post-fertilization, 2.5 ml of packed eggs were washed twice with an equal volume of cold LB buffer and homogenized by passing twice vigorously through a 22-gauge needle. The lysate was cleared at 10,000 × g for 10 min in a 5417R Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The recovered supernatant, referred to as cytoplasmic extract or S10, includes cytosol and cytoplasmic membrane vesicles. S10 was used directly or frozen and stored in small aliquots at -80 °C. Cytosol (S150) was prepared by fractionating the S10 at 150,000 × g for 3 h in a Beckman Ti50 rotor at 4 °C. S150 supernatant was used immediately or frozen in aliquots at -80 °C. The pellet of membrane vesicles (MV0) was washed twice in MWB with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride added freshly to a final concentration of 1 mm for 10 min at 45,000 × g in a Ti50 rotor. MV0 was resuspended in 0.10 of the volume of the original S10 and used immediately or quick frozen in aliquots at -80 °C. To prepare MV1 and MV2, MV0 from 2.5 ml of packed eggs was carefully resuspended in 100 μl of TN, and then 900 μl of MWB buffer was added. Complete suspension was achieved by passing through a series of increasingly smaller plastic micropipette tips (1 ml to 20 μl). MVs were stained with DiOC6 at a final concentration of 10 μg/ml and observed in a fluorescence microscope with a fluorescein filter set to confirm the absence of MV aggregates. A linear sucrose gradient of 0.1-2.0 m sucrose (15 ml) in TN buffer was made in a 16-ml Ultra-Clear Beckman centrifuge tube. The MV0 suspension was carefully applied to the top of the gradient and overlaid with mineral oil. MVs were subfractionated by sedimentation to density equilibrium at 150,000 × g for 20 h at 4 °C. Each band was recovered by side puncture with a 22-gauge needle on a 5-ml syringe. Median densities of MV1 and MV2 were 1.02 and 1.04 g/ml, respectively. Each band was diluted with 4 volumes of ice-cold MWB and concentrated at 150,000 × g for 30 min in an SW28 rotor. Each pellet was suspended in 250 μl of MWB, and the samples were aliquoted and frozen at -80 °C. Binding, Fusion, and Inhibition Assays with MVs—To 20 μl of S10 and 1.2 μl of ATP-generating system, demembranated nuclei at a final concentration of 8 × 105 were added as described (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After 1 h at room temperature, a 0.10 volume of DiOC6 stock was added and samples observed using a Zeiss Neofluar 100× oil-immersion objective and a fluorescein filter set (λex 460 ± 20 nm; λem > 500 nm). Images were captured in gray scale with a Hamamatsu Photonics C2400 SIT video camera using a frame image averaging and background subtraction with a Hamamatsu Argus-10 image processor. Decondensed nuclei with bound MVs were underlaid with 0.5 m sucrose in nuclear preparation buffer and centrifuged for 20 min at 500 × g at 4 °C. Pellets were resuspended in 20 μl of S100 or S150, and the appropriate inducer was added. Samples were incubated for 2 h. Nuclear envelope formation was scored as a continuous fluorescent rim, in contrast to the patchy appearance of bound MVs. GTP inducer was added from the stock solution to a final concentration of 0.25 mm. PI-PLC was added to a final concentration of 0.07 unit/ml. Inhibition reactions were performed by addition of inhibitors to S150. The final concentration of ET-18-OCH3 (Sigma) was 19.6 μm and of wortmannin (Sigma) was 25 nm. Each experiment was repeated at least three times, 100 nuclei were counted in each sample and standard deviations calculated. For the synaptojanin1 experiments, MVs from S10 were assembled around chromatin in the presence of ATP for an hour. Fusion was induced with 1 mm GTP for 2 h. Alternatively, nuclei were treated with 1 μg/ml of the Syn1-5ptase protein for 15 min prior to the addition of GTP, and a further 1 μg/ml Syn1-5ptase was added simultaneously with GTP. An average of 24 nuclei were scored on three independent occasions and the mean and S.E. of these results calculated. Pretreatment of MV1—MV1 was diluted in MWB, and either the inducer alone or the inducer and inhibitor was added to the reaction mix as above. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Vesicles were stained with DiOC6 as described above and were pelleted by centrifugation at 45,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed in MWB and resuspended. The pretreated MV1 was added to MV2 and S150 in presence of the ATP-generation system and decondensed nuclei. The reaction was incubated for 2 h and observed as described. LUV Preparation—LUVs were made by extrusion with a mini-extruder from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Lipids were dissolved in chloroform and mixed in the desired proportions by weight. The organic solvent was evaporated with an argon stream in a fume hood to yield a lipid film, which was hydrated in LB buffer by agitation at 4 °C. The lipid suspension was successively extruded with an Avanti Mini-Extruder (Avanti Polar Lipds) through polycarbonate filters of pore sizes 1.0 and 0.4 μm, the latter approximately the size of MVs in S10. GTP-induced Nuclear Envelope Formation Is Blocked by Depletion of the Putative Substrate of the Endogenous PI-PLC—Nuclear envelope formation in a cell-free system can be induced by adding GTP or PI-PLC (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). GTP induction of nuclear envelope formation is inhibited by the PI-PLC inhibitor U73122 (14Byrne R.D. Barona T. Garnier M. Koster G. Katan M. Poccia D.L. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To further demonstrate that GTP induction of nuclear envelope formation in the cell-free system requires endogenous PI-PLC activity, GTP was added to cytoplasmic extracts depleted of the PI-PLC substrate phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate. We used a construct of synaptojanin1 (Syn1-5ptase) phosphatase (S470-R962; lacking the Sac phosphatase and proline-rich domains), which has a strong specificity for the D5-phosphate of the inositol ring. Enzyme kinetics have shown that this construct has the greatest preference for PtdIns(4,5)P218:0/20:4 over other phosphoinositide substrates (22Schmid A.C. Wise H.M. Mitchell C.A. Nussbaum R.

Nuclear envelope formation by GTP was severely inhibited by treatment with this phosphatase indicating that an endogenous PI-PLC is required for GTP induction (Fig. 1.). Bacterial PI-PLC Treatment of Sea Urchin Membrane Vesicles Produces a Subset of Diacylglycerol Species—Bacterial PI-PLC, which hydrolyzes unphosphorylated PtdIns and has been reported to have no activity toward PtdIns(4,5)P2 (16Griffith O.H. Ryan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), was chosen for our experiments to minimize complications of rates of PtdIns phosphorylation upon the kinetics of DAG production from PtdIns(4,5)P2. In addition this enzyme does not produce inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and therefore a resulting increase in free Ca2+ associated with this effector. Hydrolysis of sea urchin cytoplasmic membrane vesicles by bacterial PLC resulted in ∼75% increase in total DAG content of the vesicles (41 ± 14 to 68 ± 18 nmol/200 μl MV0; ±S.E., n = 4). The DRG species were resolved using a novel LC-MS procedure. Direct detection of underivatized DRG in very low amounts by mass spectrometry has previously been difficult to achieve, primarily because of extremely poor ionization of the lipid. To address this we developed a novel HPLC separation of the diradylglycerols with post-column addition of ammonium formate, which permitted the formation of positively charged adducts that could then be detected by ESI-MS. In untreated membrane vesicles, the major DRG species was the alkylacyl structure 1-O-18:0/22:6 representing ∼18% of total species (Fig. 2). Following PI-PLC hydrolysis, the species profile changed, with almost a 5-fold increase in the proportion of DAG 18:0/20:4, which became the predominant species representing ∼24% of the total. Several other species initially present in lower proportions also increased, but only two of these to comparable degrees (18:0/22:4 and 1-O-18:0/22:4). A few others showed increases of ∼2-fold (18:0/20:5, 16:0/22:5; 18:1/20:2, 18:0/20:3; 18:0/22:5, and 1-O-18:0/22:4). Most species, including the predominant 1-O-18:0/22:6 present in untreated vesicles, decreased in relative amount ∼2-fold, which would be expected if their masses had not changed, while total DAG mass almost doubled. Most of the species whose relative proportions increased after PI-PLC treatment contained relatively long chain, polyunsaturated fatty acids. These result show that under the conditions used here, bacterial PI-PLC produces a large increase in a minor subset of diglycerides present in sea urchin membrane vesicles, in particular DAG 18:0/20:4. Pretreatment of MV1 with PI-PLC Renders It Fusogenic—We have previously hypothesized that, upon hydrolysis, high levels of PtdIns in MV1 provide sufficient DAGs to facilitate fusion of nuclear envelope precursors (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We tested this idea by pretreating MV1 with PI-PLC to produce diglycerides, then washing the membranes to remove soluble inositol phosphates and incubating pretreated MV1 in extracts containing the remaining egg MV nuclear envelope precursors (collectively termed MV2). As shown in TABLE ONE, nuclear envelope formation can be induced by either GTP or PI-PLC in a complete system containing decondensed sperm nuclei, cytosol (S150), an ATP generating system and MV0 (cytoplasmic MVs, which include MV1, MV2, and other unnecessary MV fractions (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Similar levels of NE formation were seen in a more defined system when purified MV1 and MV2 were substituted for MV0. If MV1 was omitted, basal levels of envelope formation were detected, indicating that MV1, although it contributes a minor fraction of total nuclear envelope, is required for envelope formation. GTP-induced fusion was blocked by wortmannin (a PI 3-kinase inhibitor), and PI-PLC induced fusion by ET-18-OCH3 (a PI-PLC inhibitor). Representative nuclei corresponding to some experiments in TABLE ONE (and keyed there) are shown in Fig. 3.TABLE ONENuclear envelope formation in vitro requires MV1 Nuclear envelopes (NEs) were formed around membrane-stripped sperm nuclei in a cell-free system. MV0 contained total cytoplasmic membrane vesicles from a 10,000g supernatant of fertilized egg extract. MV1 and MV2 were separated by buoyant density and contain all of the MV0 membrane precursors necessary to form the NE (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Formation is dependent on MV1, stimulated by GTP hydrolysis or PI-PLC activity, and inhibited, respectively, by wortmannin and ET-18-OCH3. All reactions contained decondensed sperm nuclei, cytosol (S150), and an ATP-generating system.

As shown in TABLE TWO, MV1 prehydrolyzed with PI-PLC led to nuclear envelope formation even in the absence of the PI-PLC inducer. Envelope assembly using pretreated MV1 was no longer sensitive to ET-18-OCH3 inhibition during incubation in extract, although ET-18-OCH3 blocked the effect of PI-PLC pretreatment. MV2 was required, since it provides most of the nuclear envelope (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Representative nuclei corresponding to some experiments of TABLE TWO (and keyed there) are shown in Fig. 4.TABLE TWOPretreatment of MV1 with PI-PLC renders it fusogenic NEs were formed around membrane-stripped sperm nuclei in a cell-free system.

PtdIns-rich LUVs Can Substitute for MV1—To better define the role of MV1 in the formation of nuclear envelopes, we prepared protein-free model membranes with a phospholipid composition mimicking MV1 (75% PtdIns/25% PtdCho (w/w)). These vesicles, when added to a system containing cytosol, an ATP-generating system and sperm nuclei but no MV2, bound to the nuclei at two positions corresponding to the sites of the sperm nuclear envelope remnants, thus mimicking MV1 (Fig. 5A). Binding did not occur in LB buffer (data not shown), presumably because proteins in the S150 (cytosol) are necessary to mediate specific binding. That these LUVs are capable of assuming the role of MV1 in membrane fusion was tested as shown in TABLE THREE. TABLE ONE shows that induction by PI-PLC requires the MV1 fraction. TABLE THREE shows that when MV1 is substituted by PtdIns-rich LUVs, either GTP or PI-PLC will initiate fusion, each subject to the appropriate inhibition. No envelope formation was seen when the LUV, MV2, or inducer were omitted. Some representative examples of induction of nuclear envelope formation by GTP and PI-PLC of PtdIns-rich LUVs in the presence of MV2 are shown in Fig. 5, B-E (keyed in TABLE THREE).TABLE THREEPtdIns-rich LUVs can substitute for MV1 in nuclear envelope assembly NEs were formed around membrane-stripped sperm nuclei in a cell-free system.

These vesicles bound to the same regions as MV1 and conferred GTP or PI-PLC regulation of nuclear envelope formation. DAG-rich LUVs Are Fusigenic—The experiments in TABLE TWO suggest that diglycerides in the hydrolyzed MV1 fraction are responsible for fusion. To directly test this idea, we made LUVs in which DAG was quantitatively substituted for PtdIns. When 75% DAG/25% PtdCho (w/w) LUVs were added to a system containing MV2, cytosol, and an ATP-generating system, envelope formation occurred with or without the inducers GTP or PI-PLC (TABLE FOUR). The percent of nuclei showing fusion was in all cases well above the background levels in the absence of LUVs or MV1 (TABLE ONE). No envelopes were formed without MV2 so that the LUVs by themselves did not form an envelope. Fusion was not altered by the inclusion of inhibitors of the normal inducers. Fig. 6 shows some representative examples (keyed in TABLE FOUR). These data indicate that DAG vesicles are fusigenic in a natural membrane system and suggest a mechanism for the fusion of PtdIns-rich vesicles upon hydrolysis by PI-PLC.TABLE FOURDAG-containing LUVs are fusigenic NEs were formed around membrane-stripped sperm nuclei in a cell-free system.

Nuclear Envelope Assembly in Embryos and Somatic Cells. 2002; : 111-130Crossref Google Scholar). Exogenously added bacterial PI-PLC can also induce nuclear membrane formation (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, Fig. 7). Each is dependent on a minor membrane fraction MV1, highly enriched in PtdIns (12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). MV1 contributes only 10% of the nuclear membrane vesicle precursor population and binds exclusively to the regions of the sperm nucleus containing remnants of the sperm nuclear envelope (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most of the nuclear membrane is contributed by the major fraction MV2 enriched in a marker enzyme of the endoplasmic reticulum (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biological function of MV1 is not known. A natural membrane fraction so rich in PtdIns had never been reported previously (11Larijani B. Poccia D.L. Dickinson L.C. Lipids. 2000; 35: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MV1 binds via peripheral proteins to two specific regions of the sperm nucleus (9Collas P. Poccia D. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1275-1283Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing that portion of the sperm nuclear membrane that does not break down following fertilization (23Longo F.J. Anderson E. J. Cell Biol. 1968; 39: 339-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and that is characterized by an unusual underlying osmiophilic “cup” (10Poccia D. Barona T. Collas P. Larijani B. Nuclear Envelope Assembly in Embryos and Somatic Cells. 2002; : 111-130Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, the major MV2 subfraction binds all around the nuclear periphery through lamin B receptor, a chromatin-binding intrinsic inner nuclear membrane protein (24Collas P. Courvalin J.-C. Poccia D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1715-1725Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The high concentration of PtdIns in MV1 prompted us to hypothesize that its role was to generate, upon PI-PLC catalyzed hydrolysis, a local enrichment of membrane destabilizing DAG leading to initiation of fusion with the other membrane vesicles that make up the bulk of the envelope precursors (10Poccia D. Barona T. Collas P. Larijani B. Nuclear Envelope Assembly in Embryos and Somatic Cells. 2002; : 111-130Crossref Google Scholar, 12Larijani B. Barona T.M. Poccia D.L. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 495-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence presented here support this hypothesis. First, PI-PLC-mediated fusion requires that MV1 be present. Second, pretreatment of MV1 with bacterial PI-PLC renders it fusigenic. These observations are consistent with the notion that exogenous PI-PLC acts to induce fusion in the cell-free system by production of DAG in the MV1 membrane fraction. Use of synthetic membranes of known composition permitted a third test. LUVs of 75% PtdIns/25% PtdCho mimic MV1, binding to the same regions as MV1 and conferring both GTP and PI-PLC induced fusion in the presence of MV2. Moreover, similar model membranes containing 75% DAG are also fusigenic in the absence of inducers. Although the relevant endogenous PI-PLC activities required for nuclear envelope formation (which are blocked by the inhibitor U73122 but not its inactive analog U73343 (14Byrne R.D. Barona T. Garnier M. Koster G. Katan M. Poccia D.L. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) would act upon PtdIns(4,5)P2, and the bacterial enzyme acts upon PtdIns, both produce membrane diglycerides (16Griffith O.H. Ryan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Their soluble products are InsP3 or inositol 1-phosphate, respectively. To avoid the classic signaling pathway involving InsP3 production and kinetic complications of kinase activities required for PtdIns(4,5)P2 production, we chose to use the prokaryotic PI-PLC (16Griffith O.H. Ryan M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1441: 237-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Since prehydrolyzed and washed MV1 was capable of initiating nuclear envelope formation, the effects of soluble inositols were eliminated. Use of DAG-rich LUVs also ruled out a role for production of these soluble inositols from MV1 in nuclear envelope formation in the cell-free system. Since MV2 hydrolyzed with PI-PLC was unable to form nuclear envelopes in the absence of MV1, despite containing (typically low levels of) PtdIns (11Larijani B. Poccia D.L. Dickinson L.C. Lipids. 2000; 35: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and DAG, a requirement for MV1 may be understood on the basis of its lipid ratios. We propose that high levels of PtdIns, either in a membrane domain or in a separate set of vesicles, may provide sufficient DAG upon PtdIns hydrolysis to locally initiate membrane fusion. DAG, by virtue of its physical properties, facilitates the phase transition of the lipid bilayer from lamellar to hexagonal II. This type of phase transition induces a localized destabilization of the membrane structure, which in turn favors membrane fusion. That DAG can lead to membrane fusion is supported by several reports using synthetic membrane systems treated with PLCs (17Basanez G. Ruiz-Arguello M.B. Alonso A. Goni F. Karlsson G. Edwards K. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2630-2637Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 19Villar A.V. Alonso A. Goni F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14012-14018Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 20Villar A.V. Goni F.M. Alonso A. FEBS Lett. 2001; 494: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The fatty acid chains of the PtdIns and DAG species may play an additional role. The new method for quantification of DAGs by LC-MS presented here permitted a detail of analysis and sensitivity previously unattained in a natural membrane fusion system. That the PI-PLC preferentially produces diglycerides of long chain, polyunsaturated fatty acid content is intriguing, since these are expected to have major effects on increased membrane fluidity and alteration of other structural properties that could facilitate or fine-tune membrane fusion processes. Our current and previous work emphasizes a role for DAG that is distinct from the classical pathways of signaling utilizing protein kinase C or other C-1 domain containing receptors, which typically involve low levels of DAG (Ref. 14Byrne R.D. Barona T. Garnier M. Koster G. Katan M. Poccia D.L. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar and Fig. 7). Although DAG can be generated in several ways, such as through PC-PLC hydrolysis of PtdCho or PLD pathways starting with PtdCho, it is worth noting there are no known eukaryotic PC PLCs. Moreover, we have neither been able to induce NE formation with bacterial PC-PLC nor inhibit it with D609 (29Larijani B. Role of Lipid Signaling Pathways in an Intra- and Extracellular Phenomenon. 1999; Google Scholar), a compound that inhibits both PC-PLC and PLD activities (30Kiss Z. Tomono M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1259: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the molecular species composition of PtdIns changes during fusion, whereas PtdCho is identical before and after binding and hydrolysis (14Byrne R.D. Barona T. Garnier M. Koster G. Katan M. Poccia D.L. Larijani B. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Since PI-PLC pretreatment of MV1 is sufficient to lead to NE formation in the absence of further inducers in the cell-free system, it is unlikely that other sources of DAG are necessary. We additionally suggest an important role for lipid modification in biological membrane fusion reactions. We propose that at high DAG levels, alterations of structure of natural membranes in localized regions can affect fusion events."

We showed by overlay blot that PKCalpha directly binds a 180-kDa protein, corresponding to IRS-1, and a 30-kDa molecular species, identified as 14-3-3epsilon. In intact NIH-3T3 cells overexpressing insulin receptors (3T3-hIR), insulin selectively increased PKCalpha co-precipitation with IRS-1, but not with IRS-2, and with 14-3-3epsilon, but not with other 14-3-3 isoforms. Overexpression of 14-3-3epsilon in 3T3-hIR cells significantly reduced IRS-1-bound PKCalpha activity, without altering IRS-1/PKCalpha co-precipitation. 14-3-3epsilon overexpression also increased insulin-stimulated insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, followed by increased activation of Raf1, ERK1/2, and Akt/protein kinase B. Insulin-induced glycogen synthase activity and thymidine incorporation were also augmented. Consistently, selective depletion of 14-3-3epsilon by antisense oligonucleotides caused a 3-fold increase of IRS-1-bound PKCalpha activity and a similarly sized reduction of insulin receptor and IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and signaling. In turn, selective inhibition of PKCalpha expression by antisense oligonucleotides reverted the negative effect of 14-3-3epsilon depletion on insulin signaling. Moreover, PKCalpha inhibition was accompanied by a >2-fold decrease of insulin degradation. Similar results were also obtained by overexpressing 14-3-3epsilon. Thus, in NIH-3T3 cells, insulin induces the formation of multimolecular complexes, including IRS-1, PKCalpha, and 14-3-3epsilon. The presence of 14-3-3epsilon in the complex is not necessary for IRS-1/PKCalpha interaction but modulates PKCalpha activity, thereby regulating insulin signaling and degradation."

Neither drug is completely effective, but the development of new therapies is hindered by the fact that the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of lithium and VPA are not known. The inositol depletion hypothesis has been proposed to explain the therapeutic effects of lithium in the treatment of bipolar disorder (2Berridge M.J. Downes C.P. Hanley M.R. Cell. 1989; 59: 411-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is based on the evidence that inositol monophosphatase is inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of lithium, which can, thus, disrupt the phosphoinositide cycle. More recently, VPA has also been linked to inositol depletion. VPA was found to decrease the concentration of myo-inositol in rat brain after chronic administration (3O'Donnell T. Rotzinger S. Nakashima T.T. Hanstock C.C. Ulrich M. Silverstone P.H. Brain Res. 2000; 880: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Both lithium and VPA cause a decrease in intracellular inositol in yeast (4Vaden D.L. Ding D. Peterson B. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol.

Moreover, a recent study showed that lithium, VPA, and carbamazepine, another mood-stabilizing drug, decreased growth cone collapse and increased growth cone area in sensory neurons in culture. These effects were abolished by the addition of inositol (5Williams R.S. Cheng L. Mudge A.W. Harwood A.J. Nature. 2002; 417: 292-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar).

The de novo biosynthesis of inositol has been extensively characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Isolation of spontaneous mutants unable to grow in the absence of inositol in S. cerevisiae was first carried out three decades ago (6Culbertson M.R. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1975; 80: 23-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inositol auxotroph mutants undergo inositol-less death, the abrupt decrease in viable cells when deprived of inositol (7Henry S.A. Donahue T.F. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the rate-limiting step of inositol synthesis, glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) is converted to myo-inositol 3-phosphate (MIP), catalyzed by the INO1-encoded MIP synthase (8Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 245-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). MIP is then dephosphorylated to myo-inositol by inositol monophosphatase (8Majumder A.L. Johnson M.D. Henry S.A. Biochim. Biophys.

The extensive genetic and biochemical characterization of inositol metabolism in yeast make it an excellent model for investigating the mechanisms of action of inositol-depleting drugs. Furthermore, MIP synthase is highly conserved from yeast to humans, as expression of human MIP synthase complements the inositol auxotrophy of yeast ino1 null mutants (17Ju S. Shaltiel G. Shamir A. Agam G. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21759-21765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Consistent with the hypothesis that VPA depletes inositol by indirect inhibition of MIP synthase, human MIP synthase activity is decreased in vivo in the presence of VPA (17Ju S. Shaltiel G. Shamir A. Agam G. Greenberg M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 21759-21765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). To determine how lithium and VPA affect the inositol metabolic pathway, we used a genetic approach to identify mutants hypersensitive to lithium and VPA in the absence of inositol. We identified a yeast mutant defective in TPI1, which encodes triose phosphate isomerase. This enzyme catalyzes the interconversion of DHAP and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P). In humans, TPI deficiency is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by autosomal recessive inheritance (18Schneider A.S. Valentine W.N. Hattori M. Heins Jr., H.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1965; 272: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). It is associated with chronic hemolytic anemia, recurrent infections, cardiomyopathy, progressive neurologic dysfunction, and death in childhood (18Schneider A.S. Valentine W.N. Hattori M. Heins Jr., H.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1965; 272: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The crystal structures of Tpi1p from different species indicate that the enzyme is a dimer of two identical subunits (19Wierenga R.K. Kalk K.H. Hol W.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 109-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20Lolis E. Alber T. Davenport R.C. Rose D. Hartman F.C. Petsko G.A.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2594-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The subunit interface is of particular interest because it is critical for dimer stability (23Sun A.Q. Yuksel K.U. Gracy R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20168-20174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Casal J.I. Ahern T.J. Davenport R.C. Petsko G.A. Klibanov A.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1258-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In humans, 80% of TPI-deficient patients carry an inherited substitution of aspartate for glutamate at residue 104 (E104D). This mutation is located at the subunit interface of the Tpi1p dimer, which leads to loss of enzyme activity due to instability of the mutant dimer (25Arya R. Lalloz M.R. Bellingham A.J. Layton D.M. Hum. Mutat. 1997; 10: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In this report we show that a single mutation (N65K) in the dimer interface region of TPi1p completely abolished enzyme activity and led to a 30-fold increase in the intracellular DHAP level. Interestingly, tpi1 exhibited the inositol auxotrophy phenotype. Consistent with inositol auxotrophy, MIP synthase was inhibited by DHAP, and other metabolites of carbohydrate metabolism also inhibited the enzyme. This is the first report indicating that the perturbation of glycolysis inhibits the inositol biosynthetic pathway. Materials—All chemicals used were reagent grade or better.

Complete synthetic defined medium contained glucose (2% w/v), ammonium sulfate (2 g/liter), and the amino acids and nucleotides arginine (20 mg/liter), adenine (20 mg/liter), histidine (10 mg/liter), leucine (60 mg/liter), lysine (20 mg/liter), methionine (20 mg/liter), threonine (0.3 g/liter), tryptophan (20 g/liter), and uracil (40 mg/liter). The salts added are essentially the components of Difco vitamin-free yeast base and the full vitamin supplement. Minimal synthetic sporulation medium contained 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% dextrose, 1% potassium acetate, and 2% agarose and was supplemented with methionine, histidine, and uracil. Chemical Mutagenesis—Ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis was carried out according to the method of Lindegren et al. (26Lindegren G. Hwang Y.L. Oshima Y. Lindegren C.C. Can. J. Genet. Cytol. 1965; 7: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Cells were mutagenized to 50–90% kill. Screen for Lithium- and VPA-hypersensitive (lvs) Mutants—Mutagenized cells were plated on YPD plates and replica-plated to complete synthetic inositol-free medium with or without 60 mm LiCl or 6 mm VPA. lvs mutants were identified, patched to YPD plates, and replica-plated to medium containing or lacking lithium, VPA, or myo-inositol (75 μm). Mutants in which hypersensitivity to lithium and VPA was reversed in the presence of inositol were chosen for further analysis. Identification of Mutant Genes—Mutants containing mutations in a single nuclear gene were transformed by electroporation with a genomic library in the YCp50 plasmid (pBR236) containing ∼10–15 kilobases of yeast genomic DNA or a cDNA library (λYES), and transformants were selected by uracil prototrophy. The transformants were replica-plated onto plates containing lithium or VPA to select for increased drug resistance. To confirm that colonies acquired resistance from the plasmid, plasmid DNA was extracted from yeast using a Zymoprep yeast plasmid miniprep kit, amplified in Escherichia coli, extracted using a Wizard Miniprep DNA purification kit, and retransformed into the mutant. DNA Sequencing—The plasmid inserts of the complementary clones were sequenced using ABI fluorescence technology with primers that flank the insertion site. The nucleotide sequences obtained from the forward and reverse primers were used to identify the cloned genes. Primers were designed that flanked the insertion site (the BamHI site, nucleotide 378) of the genomic fragment in the YCp50 vector. The forward primer begins at nucleotide 329, 5′-TTGGAGCCACTATCGACTACG-3′, and the reverse primer begins at nucleotide 399, 5′-ATGCGTCCGGCGTAGAGGATC-3′. The primer designed for the λYES vector flanked the XhoI site, the forward primer beginning at nucleotide 7767, 5′-GGAATTACCAAGACCATTGGC-3′, and reverse primer beginning at nucleotide 95, 5′-ATGTTGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCG-3′. Cycle sequencing was performed with ABI PRISM Dye terminators. The sequences obtained were analyzed by a data base search using Blast in the Saccharomyces Genomic Database to search for sequences showing homology to the sequenced clones. The TPI1 alleles were isolated from genomic DNA of wild type SMY15 and lvs5 strains. Several internal primers were designed to sequence the entire coding regions of the TPI1 gene and 1-kilobase sequences upstream of the start codon. Cycle sequencing using ABI PRISM Dye terminators was carried out, and data base searching and alignment were performed. Growth Conditions—Cells were precultured in the presence of 75 μm inositol for 24 h. Precultured cells grown in inositol were washed twice and suspended in fresh medium for inoculation. Liquid cultures were inoculated to an A550 of 0.1 and grown to the indicated growth phase. Cell number was determined by microscopic counting using a hemocytometer, and the desired numbers of cells were spotted on the indicated plates. Cell viability was determined by serial dilution and plating on YPD plates. Plasmid Construction—A 2012-bp sequence (Chromosome IV, 555639–557651) containing the TPI1 gene was excised from the isolated genomic plasmid clone by the restriction enzymes HindIII and ClaI and cloned into the YCp50 vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid YCp50-TPI1 contains the complete TPI1 coding sequence with flanking sequences 1187 bp upstream and 82 bp downstream. A 426-bp TPI1 sequence was amplified from yeast chromosomal DNA using the TPI1 5′ primer, 5′-AGAAGCCACAAGTCACTGTCG-3′, and TPI1 3′ primer, 5′-CCAACTTGGAAGCCAAGAAC-3′. The PCR reaction products were cloned into the pGEM-T EASY vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid pGEM-426 was linearized with NdeI for synthesis of the TPI1 riboprobe. Measurement of TPI1 and INO1 Expression—Cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated by hot phenol extraction (27Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Strul K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley Interscience, John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1994: 13.12Google Scholar), fractionated on an agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The blots were hybridized with 32P-labeled TPI or INO1 riboprobes followed by a riboprobe for the constitutively expressed ribosomal protein gene TCM1 to normalize for loading variation. RNA probes for Northern analysis were synthesized using the Promega Riboprobe system from plasmids linearized with restriction enzymes as follows (listed as plasmid, restriction enzyme, and RNA polymerase): pGEM-426, NdeI, T7 (TPI1); pJH310, HindIII, T7 (INO1); pAB309, EcoRI, SP6 (TCM1). The results of Northern blot hybridization were quantitated by phosphorimaging. Protein Assay—Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Triose Phosphate Isomerase Assay—The specific activity of triose phosphate isomerase was determined in cell-free extracts as described by Maitra and Lobo (29Maitra P.K. Lobo Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 475-488Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Determination of Intracellular DHAP Concentration—Determination of intracellular DHAP concentration was performed in cell-free extracts as described by Compagno et al. (30Compagno C. Boschi F. Ranzi B.M. c. 1996; 12: 591-595Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were rapidly collected by filtration through a 0.8-μm filter and resuspended in precooled 9% HClO4. The acidic cell suspension was frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on ice three times. Neutralization of the cell-free extract was carried out with 2 m KHCO3 at pH 7. The DHAP assay was performed in 0.1 m triethanolamine buffer, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm NADH, and 1 unit/ml glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. To calculate the intracellular DHAP concentration, a yeast cytosolic volume of 1.67 μl per mg of dry yeast biomass was assumed (31de Koning W. van Dam K. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 204: 118-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Purification of Recombinant MIP Synthase—Yeast (32Stein A.J. Geiger J.H. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 21759-21765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) MIP synthases were isolated and purified as previously described. MIP Synthase Assay—Two well established methods were used to measure the MIP synthase activity; the paper chromatographic method of Chen and Charalampous (33Chen I.W. Charalampous C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2194-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the colorimetric method of Barnett et al. (34Barnett J.E. Brice R.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The effect of high concentrations of DHAP on yeast MIP synthase was assayed by the chromatographic method of Chen and Charalampous (33Chen I.W. Charalampous C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 2194-2199Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), because contaminating phosphate in high concentrations of DHAP interfered with the latter procedure. Activity was measured in the presence of 100 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 20 mm NH4Cl, 0.8 mm NAD+, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm G6P, and 0.2 mg of purified yeast MIP synthase protein. Specific activities, Michaelis constants (Km), and inhibition constants (Ki) for DHAP, G3P, and oxaloacetate (OAA) on yeast and human MIP synthase were determined by the colorimetric method of Barnett et al. (34Barnett J.E. Brice R.E. Corina D.L. Biochem. J. 1970; 119: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reaction tubes contained 100 mm Tris acetate, 20 mm NH4Cl, 0.8 mm NAD+, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg of purified protein buffered to pH 7.0 for yeast MIP synthase and pH 8.0 for human MIP synthase. Michaelis constants (Km) for G6P and inhibition constants (Ki) for DHAP, G3P, and OAA were determined by employing Lineweaver-Burk analysis of enzyme velocity in the reaction buffer with varying concentrations of G6P (0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mm), DHAP(0, 100, 250, and 500 μm), G3P (0, 100, 250, and 500 μm), and OAA (0, 100, 250, and 500 μm). Identification of tpi1—To identify common targets of lithium and VPA, we implemented a genetic screen to isolate mutants hypersensitive to both drugs in the absence of inositol, in which hypersensitivity was rescued by exogenous inositol. Ethylmethane sulfonate mutagenesis was carried out according to the method of Lindegren et al. (26Lindegren G. Hwang Y.L. Oshima Y. Lindegren C.C. Can. J. Genet. Cytol. 1965; 7: 491-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mutagenized wild type cells (35,000) were screened, and 26 mutants, termed lvs mutants (lithium and valproate sensitive), were isolated. All mutants were recessive, and 12 complementation groups were identified, including 6 in which mutants displayed a temperature-sensitive (ts) growth phenotype. One of the ts mutants, lvs5, was characterized further. Phenotypic analysis revealed that lvs5 is auxotrophic for inositol and temperature-sensitive (Fig. 1A). The mutant was unable to grow at 30 °C on synthetic media lacking inositol, but 5 μm inositol supported growth. The mutant was hypersensitive to lithium or VPA in the presence of 5 μm inositol. Supplementation with 75 μm inositol could partially restore growth of the mutant in the presence of lithium and VPA (Fig. 1B) but did not restore growth of the mutant at 39 °C (Fig. 1A). Further analysis indicated that the mutant exhibited inositol-less death, the precipitous decrease in viability when cells are starved for inositol (7Henry S.A. Donahue T.F. Culbertson M.R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1975; 143: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2, lvs5 cells shifted from I+ to I– media lost viability similar to ino1Δ cells, in which MIP synthase is deleted.FIGURE 2The lvs5 mutant undergoes inositol-less death when starved for inositol. Cells of ino1Δ (left panel), lvs5 (right panel), and isogenic wild type (WT) strains (BY4741 and SMY15, respectively) were grown in I+ SC media to the middle logarithmic phase of growth. Cells were harvested, washed twice, and shifted at time 0 to I+ or I– media. Cells were harvested at the indicated times after the shift, serially diluted, plated on YPD plates, and incubated at 30 °C for 48 h.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To clone the gene mutated in lvs5, the lvs5 mutant was transformed with genomic and cDNA libraries, and transformants were screened for the ability to grow at 30 °C in the absence of inositol, in the presence of 60 mm lithium or 6 mm VPA, and at the non-permissive temperature of 39 °C on synthetic uracil drop out media. A genomic library plasmid bearing a 7.4-kilobase DNA sequence containing the TPI1 locus and a cDNA library plasmid containing the TPI1 gene complemented the mutant phenotypes, including drug sensitivity, inositol dependence, and temperature-sensitive growth. The TPI1 gene was subsequently cloned into the YCp50 plasmid and transformed into the lvs5 mutant. Expression of the TPI1 gene restored growth in the absence of inositol, in the presence of lithium and VPA, and at 39 °C (Fig. 3). Sequencing analysis revealed a single C-to-A mutation in the TPI1 locus of lvs5, resulting in a missense codon leading to a single amino acid change, Asn to Lys, at residue 65 (N65K). The Asn-65 residue is at the dimer interface and is conserved in all species for which the gene has been sequenced (NCBI GenBank™) (Fig. 4). The lvs5 mutant will be referred to as tpi1.FIGURE 4Conserved Tpi1p amino acid sequences. The comparison was carried out using the ClustalW program.

As seen in TABLE TWO, triose phosphate isomerase activity is not detectable in tpi1 mutant cells, which accumulate about 30-fold more DHAP than wild type cells. This is consistent with levels found in a previously identified tpi1 mutant (30Compagno C. Boschi F. Ranzi B.M. c. 1996; 12: 591-595Google Scholar). The presence of a plasmid-born TPI1 gene in tpi1 restored wild type levels of enzyme activity and intracellular DHAP. The loss of triose phosphate isomerase activity in the tpi1 mutant is not due to decreased expression of TPI1, the levels of which were similar in tpi1 and wild type cells (Fig. 5).TABLE TWOTriose phosphate isomerase activity and intracellular DHAP concentration in tpi1StrainsTriose phosphate isomerase activityIntracellular DHAPunits/mg of proteinmmWild type11.3 ± 1.60.76 ± 0.05tpi1ND23.67 ± 4.04tpi1 + TPI19.5 ± 1.20.77 ± 0.04tpi1 + YCp50ND25.7 ± 3.51WT + YCp509.8 ± 1.40.75 ± 0.04 Open table in a new tab High Levels of DHAP Inhibit MIP Synthase Activity—To determine whether inositol auxotrophy could be explained by inhibition of MIP synthase by DHAP, we assayed the activity of purified yeast MIP synthase in the presence of DHAP. As seen in Fig. 6, DHAP inhibits MIP synthase activity. At 22 mm DHAP, the concentration observed in the tpi1 mutant, yeast MIP synthase activity was completely abolished. This result suggested that inositol auxotrophy of tpi1 is due to inhibition of MIP synthase by increased DHAP levels and predicted that other glycolysis mutants that accumulate DHAP are also inositol auxotrophs. The glycolysis mutant pgk1 is defective in the conversion of 3-phosphoglyceroyl phosphate to 3-phosphoglycerate, and accumulation of DHAP has been demonstrated in this mutant (35Ciriacy M. Breitenbach I. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 139: 152-160Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this prediction, pgk1 was also unable to grow in the absence of inositol (Fig. 7A) and exhibited inositol-less death when deprived of inositol (Fig. 7B). Inositol auxotrophy of tpi1 could not be explained by the inability to derepress INO1. As seen in Fig. 8A, INO1 is derepressible in the tpi1 mutant when deprived of inositol. INO1 abundance was quantified by Northern analysis of RNA extracted from cells after the shift from I+ to I– media. INO1 expression was similar in tpi1 and wild type cells (Fig. 8A). Furthermore, when assayed in the absence of DHAP, MIP synthase was active in tpi1 cell extracts (Fig. 8B). These results indicate that INO1 is expressed normally in tpi1 and translated into an active protein.FIGURE 7The pgk1 mutant is unable to grow in the absence of inositol and undergoes inositol-less death. Cells of the pgk1 mutant and isogenic wild type (WT) strain N501–1B were grown in I+ SC media to the middle logarithmic phase of growth.

Data represent the average of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We wished to determine whether other intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism similar to DHAP inhibit MIP synthase at elevated concentrations. This might indicate tight control of MIP synthase during perturbation of carbohydrate metabolism. The glycolytic pathway intermediate, G3P, and the TCA cycle intermediate, OAA, inhibited MIP synthase activity as well (TABLE THREE). The Michaelis constant (Km) for G6P, the substrate of yeast MIP synthase, was 250 μm. As seen in TABLE THREE, DHAP, G3P, and OAA were all competitive inhibitors of yeast MIP synthase with respective Ki values of 156, 127, and 109 μm. Our result is consistent with the previous finding that DHAP is a competitive inhibitor of yeast MIP synthase. For human MIP synthase, we observed similar results. The Km for G6P was 185 μm. The Ki values for DHAP, G3P, and OAA were 115, 102, and 88 μm, respectively. In patients with triose phosphate deficiency, DHAP levels as high as 3.772 μmol/g Hb (36Ationu A. Humphries A. Lalloz M.R. Arya R. Wild B. Warrilow J. Morgan J. Bellingham A.J. Layton D.M. Blood. 1999; 94: 3193-3198Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or 904.9 nmol/ml of RBC (37Hollan S. Dey I. Szollar L. Horanyi M.

These levels can be extrapolated to ∼1–3 mm, which is in the range that can inhibit human MIP synthase activity in vitro.TABLE THREEInhibition of MIP synthase by DHAP, G-3-P, and OAAInhibitorType of inhibitionKiμmYeast MIP synthase Km for G6P, 250 μmDHAPCompetitive156G3PCompetitive127OAACompetitive109Human MIP synthase Km for G6P, 185 μmDHAPCompetitive115G3PCompetitive102OAACompetitive88 Open table in a new tab The demonstration of inositol auxotrophy in the tpi1 mutant intriguingly links perturbation of glycolysis to the inositol biosynthetic pathway. Intracellular DHAP increased about 30-fold in tpi1, consistent with DHAP levels reported for a previously isolated tpi1 mutant (30Compagno C. Boschi F. Ranzi B.M. c. 1996; 12: 591-595Google Scholar). DHAP is a competitive inhibitor of MIP synthase, probably due to its structural similarity to the ketone and phosphate moieties of myo-2-inosose 1-phosphate, an intermediate in the MIP synthase reaction. In the tpi1 mutant the INO1 gene is derepressed, and MIP synthase protein is expressed when inositol is limiting, as shown in Fig. 6. Therefore, inhibition of MIP synthase by DHAP is the most likely explanation for inositol auxotrophy of tpi1. Consistent with this, the glycolysis mutant pgk1, which also accumulates DHAP, was also auxotrophic for inositol. Purified yeast and human MIP synthases were inhibited by DHAP as well as by other metabolites of carbohydrate metabolism, including G3P and OAA. These results suggest that genetic perturbation of glycolysis leads to inhibition of inositol de novo biosynthesis by direct inhibition of MIP synthase. This report demonstrates a direct link between glycolysis and inositol biosynthesis and differs mechanistically and qualitatively from previous studies linking regulation of carbohydrate utilization to INO1 expression. Expression of INO1 is affected by the glucose response pathway, an energy-saving mechanism that turns off expression of genes required for utilization of carbon sources other than glucose when glucose is present, and turns them on when glucose is limiting (38Ronne H. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 12-17Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 39Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). In yeast, the glucose response pathway is mediated by the Snf1p·Snf4p kinase complex and the Reg1p·Glc7p phosphatase complex, which regulate Mig1p, a repressor of genes required for utilization of non-glucose carbon sources (39Carlson M. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). When glucose is limiting, the Snf1p·Snf4p kinase inactivates Mig1p. When glucose is abundant, Mig1p is activated by Reg1p·Glc7p phosphatase. Interestingly, the glucose repression pathway affects inositol synthesis at the level of INO1 expression. The snf1Δ and snf4Δ mutants display low levels of INO1 expression and are inositol auxotrophs (40Hirschhorn J.N. Brown S.A. Clark C.D. Winston F. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2288-2298Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 41Shirra M.K. Arndt K.M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 73-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the reg1 mutant exhibits increased expression of INO1 and has an inositol excretion phenotype (41Shirra M.K. Arndt K.M. Genetics. 1999; 152: 73-87Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 42Ouyang Q. Ruiz-Noriega M. Henry S.A. Genetics. 1999; 152: 89-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, expression of INO1 is altered when the response to glucose is genetically perturbed. The results reported here have implications for the pathology associated with TPI deficiency, one of several well studied glycolytic enzyme deficiencies (18Schneider A.S. Valentine W.N. Hattori M.

Hematol. 1995; 50: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In contrast to other deficiencies, TPI-deficient patients have a progressive, severe neurologic disorder (44Olah J. Orosz F. Keseru G.M. Kovari Z. Kovacs J. Hollan S. Ovadi J. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 30-38Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The neurological defects may be, in part, a result of inositol deficiency. The brain possesses ∼6 mm inositol, and alterations in brain inositol concentrations have been reported in a number of pathological conditions, including bipolar disorder, Down syndrome, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (45Fisher S.K. Novak J.E. Agranoff B.W. J. Neurochem. 2002; 82: 736-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). A recent study indicated that MIP synthase activity is inhibited by VPA in crude homogenates of human prefrontal cortex (46Shaltiel G. Shamir A. Shapiro J. Ding D. Dalton E. Bialer M. Harwood A.J. Belmaker R.H. Greenberg M.L. Agam G. Biol. Psychiatry. 2004; 56: 868-874Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which may explain the observed decrease in intracellular inositol in the brain (3O'Donnell T. Rotzinger S. Nakashima T.T. Hanstock C.C. Ulrich M. Silverstone P.H. Brain Res. 2000; 880: 84-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). In patients with TPI deficiency, DHAP levels of 1–3 mm are as much as 100-fold higher than normal (36Ationu A. Humphries A. Lalloz M.R. Arya R. Wild B. Warrilow J. Morgan J. Bellingham A.J.

A. 1995; 92: 268-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Human MIP synthase activity is inhibited by 25% in the presence of 1 mm DHAP (data not shown). It is possible that inhibition of MIP synthase by increased DHAP in TPI deficiency leads to inositol depletion in the brain, which may be alleviated by inositol supplementation. It is noteworthy in this regard that inositol has been documented to be an effective treatment for several central nervous system disorders, such as depression, Alzheimer disease, panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (47Colodny L. Hoffman R.L. Altern. Med. Rev. 1998; 3: 432-447PubMed Google Scholar). This study may have implications for responsiveness to the inositol depleting drugs, lithium and VPA. For example, diabetes-related hyperglycemia is associated with a 3–10-fold increase in DHAP and G3P levels (48Trueblood N. Ramasamy R. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: H75-Y83Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 49Stevens V.J. Vlassara H. Abati A. Cerami A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2998-3002Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Obrosova I. Cao X. Greene D.A. Stevens M.J. Diabetologia. 1998; 41: 1442-1450Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The accumulation of both DHAP and G3P might affect inositol de novo biosynthesis by inhibition of MIP synthase activity and could, thus, have a potential synergistic effect with inositol depleting drugs. Further analysis of the interconnection between glycolysis and inositol de novo biosynthesis may enable us to better understand and treat disorders affecting these metabolic pathways.

LXR activation is induced by oxysterol end products of the mevalonate pathway and is inhibited by the upstream non-sterol isoprenoid, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Whether isoprenoids play a role in regulating the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis is unknown. In CaCo-2 colon epithelial cells, depletion of mevalonate and its derivatives, including oxysterol ligands for LXR, increased fatty acid synthesis. Addition of mevalonate or its isoprenoid derivative, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), prevented this increase. The effects of FPP were likely due to itself or its degradation products, because none of its downstream derivatives, GGPP, ubiquinone, or cholesterol, were effective. Moreover, the effects of FPP could not be accounted for by protein prenylation, because inhibition of farnesylation did not alter fatty acid synthesis in mevalonate-depleted cells incubated with the isoprenoid. Neither was fatty acid synthesis in these cells altered by inhibition of β-oxidation. Mevalonate depletion increased fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA by transcriptional mechanisms, without increasing gene expression of other enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis or of SREBP-1c. The abundance of mature SREBP-2 but not SREBP-1 was increased following mevalonate depletion. FPP prevented the increase in FAS mRNA in mevalonate-depleted cells without altering SREBP-2 activation. Thus, FPP regulates fatty acid synthesis by a mechanism that is likely independent of the SREBP pathway.

Enzymes catalyzing the synthesis and metabolism of both lipids are coordinately regulated by the same transcription factors, the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) 2The abbreviations used are: SREBPsterol regulatory element-binding proteinLXRliver X receptorACCacetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylaseACLATP-citrate lyaseFASfatty acid synthaseFOHfarnesolFPPfarnesyl pyrophosphateFTIfarnesyl pyrophosphate transferase inhibitorFXRfarnesoid X receptorGPPgeranyl pyrophosphategeranylgeraniolgeranylgeraniolGGPPgeranylgeranyl pyrophosphateHMG-CoA reductase3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductaseIPPisopentenyl pyrophosphateRXRretinoid X receptorC/EBPCCAAT enhancer-binding protein. and the liver X receptors (LXRs) (1Horton J.D.

Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). They form obligate heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs), another member of this receptor family, and subsequently bind to specific response elements in regulatory regions of their target genes (3Repa J.J. Mangelsdorf D.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar, 4Willy P.J. Umesono K. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 459-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). In addition, the nuclear receptor heterodimer also induces the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis by activating another transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) (2Repa J.J. Liang G. Ou J. Bashmakov Y. Lobaccaro J.M. Shimomura I. Shan B. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Mangelsdorf D.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (1423) Google Scholar). Three SREBPs have been described, SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2. SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c are products of a single gene through alternative splicing, whereas SREBP-2 is a product of separate gene (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). Although SREBP-1c activates genes involved in the synthesis of fatty acids, SREBP-2 preferentially activates genes for cholesterol synthesis and the low density lipoprotein receptor (1Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1125-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar). Ligands for LXRs include various oxidized derivatives of cholesterol, which is an end product of the mevalonate pathway (see Fig. 1) (5Janowski B.A. Grogan M.J. Jones S.A. Wisely G.B. Kliewer S.A.

Depletion of cholesterol and its oxysterol derivatives decreases transcriptional activity of the LXR/RXR heterodimer (8Forman B.M. Ruan B. Chen J. Schroepfer Jr., G.J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10588-10593Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Addition of mevalonate and oxysterol ligands for LXRs restores transcription mediated by the nuclear receptor complex. In contrast, the upstream non-sterol isoprenoid derivative of mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and its alcohol derivative, geranylgeraniol, inhibit the activity of the LXR/RXR heterodimer by interfering with LXR activation (8Forman B.M.

As a result, GGPP decreases transcription of an LXR target gene, the ATP-binding cassette protein A1, that is involved in cholesterol efflux from cells (9Gan X. Kaplan R. Menke J.G. MacNaul K.

It is not known whether other target genes of LXRs, such as enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis, are similarly altered by non-sterol isoprenoid derivatives of mevalonate. sterol regulatory element-binding protein liver X receptor acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase ATP-citrate lyase fatty acid synthase farnesol farnesyl pyrophosphate farnesyl pyrophosphate transferase inhibitor farnesoid X receptor geranyl pyrophosphate geranylgeraniol geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase isopentenyl pyrophosphate retinoid X receptor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein. Depletion of both sterol and non-sterol derivatives of mevalonate by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase has previously been observed to enhance fatty acid and triglyceride synthesis (10Roglans N. Verd J.C. Peris C. Alegret M. Vazquez M. Adzet T. Diaz C. Hernandez G. Laguna J.C. Sanchez R.M. Lipids. 2002; 37: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 11Fujioka T. Tsujita Y. Shimotsu H. Eur J Pharmacol. 1997; 328: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Although this was accompanied by increased expression of some of the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, it is unclear whether the underlying mechanism involved increased activation of SREBP-1c. Because inhibition of mevalonate synthesis would limit the availability of cholesterol and its oxidized derivatives, enhanced lipogenesis under such conditions cannot be due to increased ligand-mediated activation of LXRs. In fact, under such conditions, LXR activation and transcription of SREBP-1c would be decreased. We, therefore, postulated that the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition on increasing fatty acid synthesis is independent of SREBP-1c and is due to limited availability of non-sterol isoprenoid derivatives of mevalonate. It has been suggested that isoprenoids affect cellular processes by multiple mechanisms. Isoprenoids, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and GGPP, are utilized for prenylating membrane-bound small GTPases, such as members of the Ras superfamily, which play critical roles in cell proliferation and cytoskeletal maintenance (12Sahai E. Marshall C.J. Nat Rev Cancer. 2002; 2: 133-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1227) Google Scholar, 13Coleman M.L. Marshall C.J. Olson M.F. Nat Rev Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 355-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Isoprenylation of these proteins is necessary for their translocation to the plasma membrane and subsequent activation. Besides serving as substrates for post-translational modification, FPP and GGPP have been reported to regulate the transcription of some of these proteins (14Holstein S.A. Wohlford-Lenane C.L. Hohl R.J. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13698-13704Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which isoprenoids may directly or indirectly affect transcription of proteins are not well understood. In this respect, GGPP has been shown to inhibit the transcription of ATP-binding cassette protein A1 by acting as a direct antagonist of ligand-mediated activation of LXRs (9Gan X. Kaplan R. Menke J.G. MacNaul K. Chen Y. Sparrow C.P. Zhou G. Wright S.D. Cai T.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48702-48708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). However, the one or more mechanisms by which FPP could alter transcriptional events are not defined. CaCo-2 colon epithelial cells have active lipogenic pathways and thus serve as a model for examining the interaction between isoprenoids and fatty acid synthesis. Using these cells, we demonstrate that depletion of mevalonate and all its derivatives causes a transcriptional-dependent increase in fatty acid synthesis and fatty acid synthase (FAS) mRNA levels. Exogenous mevalonate and its isoprenoid derivative, FPP, prevent this increase, whereas other derivatives of mevalonate do not. Gene expression of SREBP-1c and of its other lipogenic targets, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL), and the abundance of mature SREBP-1 protein remain unaltered. In contrast, the abundance of mature SREBP-2 and the expression of its lipogenic targets genes are enhanced following mevalonate depletion. FPP prevents the increase in fatty acid synthesis and FAS mRNA without altering the activation of SREBP-2. Thus, FPP regulates fatty acid synthesis by a transcriptional mechanism that is likely mediated by FAS and is independent of SREBP. Materials—Lovastatin, mevalonolactone, isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP), dimethylallyl pyrophosphate, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP), FPP, farnesol (FOH), GGPP, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, squalene, actinomycin D, and etomoxir were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Cholesterol was purchased from Steraloids (Newport, RI). Lovastatin and mevalonolactone were dissolved in 0.1N sodium hydroxide to generate their respective active open acid forms and the pH was adjusted to 7.4 with 0.1 n hydrochloric acid. FTI-277 and ubiquinone were from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). [14C]Sodium acetate (56.5 mCi/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [1-14C]palmitic acid (50 mCi/mmol) was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals (St. Louis, MO). Silica gel thin layer chromatography plates (250 μm) were purchased from Analtech (Newark, DE). Monoclonal antibodies to human SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal antibody to human caspase-3 and rabbit polyclonal antibody to lamin A (H102) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Rabbit polyclonal antibody, raised against the carboxyl terminus of prelamin A, was a generous gift from Dr. Scott Kaufmann (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Anti-mouse IgG-HRP, anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, and ECL Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrates were from Pierce. All other materials were reagent grade. Cell Culture—CaCo-2 cells, obtained from Dr. F. J. Field (University of Iowa), were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in T-75 cm2 or T-150 cm2 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 mg/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 2 mml-glutamine, and 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids and supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin. Cells were subcultured in 6-well plates at a density of 0.08 million per well. Near confluent monolayers, obtained after 5 days in culture, were incubated for 24 h in serum-free M199 containing the various treatments. Appropriate vehicle controls for every treatment were included. Serum was excluded from the incubation media to avoid the effect of exogenous sterols and fatty acids on de novo fatty acid synthesis. Fatty Acid Synthesis—Cells were pulsed for the last 2 h of a 24-h incubation with 1 μCi/well [14C]sodium acetate. After the incubation, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, and cellular lipids were extracted and saponified as previously described (15Field F.J. Born E. Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Labeled sterols and free fatty acids were sequentially extracted, with 2 × 3 ml of hexane, under alkaline and acidic conditions, respectively. Incorporation of labeled acetate into each fraction was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To ensure that there was no cross-contamination of counts between the two lipid fractions, fatty acid and sterol extracts from a few separate experiments were isolated as above. Total extracts of each lipid fraction were dried under nitrogen, taken up in 100 μlof chloroform and spotted on thin layer chromatography plates together with fatty acid and cholesterol standards (Nuchek, Elysian, MN). The plates were then eluted in a solvent system of hexanes:ethyl ether:acetic acid, 75:25:1, v/v, and visualized under iodine vapor. Incorporation of labeled acetate into bands corresponding to free fatty acids and cholesterol was determined by scanning the plates using the AMBIS radioisotope detection scanner (Scanalytics, Billerica, MA). Over 95% of counts incorporated into the total sterol or fatty acid extracts were recovered in bands corresponding to the respective lipid. β-Oxidation of Palmitic Acid—Cells were collected from T-150 cm2 flasks by trypsinization and then counted. One million cells were preincubated with 10 μm etomoxir in Krebs Ringer bicarbonate buffer in flasks fitted with central wells. After 30 min 0.1 μCi of 2 μm [1-14C]palmitic acid was added to each flask, and 400 μl of hyamine hydroxide (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to each central well. The total volume of the incubation mixture per flask was 1 ml. Hyamine hydroxide was used to trap released [14C]CO2. Flasks were made air-tight with non-vented caps. Following incubation for 1 h at 37°C, hyamine hydroxide was transferred to 10 ml of Emulsifier Safe liquid scintillation mixture (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), dark-adapted overnight, and counted by liquid scintillation counting. Estimation of Relative mRNA Abundance by Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). DNase-free RNA was reverse transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and then subjected to real-time quantitative PCR using Sybr Green (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the appropriate forward and reverse primers on an ABI Prism model 7000 sequence-detection system (Applied Biosystems). Results are expressed relative to control after normalizing to 18 S rRNA. Single products for each RT-PCR reaction were obtained.

The cell pellet was lysed in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, containing 100 mm sodium chloride, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease and phosphatase inhibitor mixtures (Sigma). Cells were mechanically disrupted by repeated passage through a 27-gauge syringe and needle and centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in a tabletop microcentrifuge. Equivalent amounts of the supernatant containing the solubilized proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels (for the detection of caspase-3) or 7.5% gels (for all other proteins) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. For detection of prelamin A, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (TBS containing 5% nonfat milk and 0.05% Tween 20). Nitrocellulose membranes were blocked in TBS containing 10% nonfat dry milk and 0.05% Tween 20. Membranes were then incubated for an additional hour with anti-SREBP-1 (diluted 250-fold), anti-SREBP-2 (diluted 250-fold), anti-lamin A (diluted 200-fold), or anti-caspase-3 (diluted 100-fold) antibodies dissolved in blocking buffer containing 5% milk. For the detection of prelamin A nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with blocking buffer containing 10% milk and anti-prelamin A antibody diluted 500-fold. Membranes were washed six times for 5 min each with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. They were then incubated for 1 h with their respective secondary antibodies diluted 3000-fold in blocking buffer containing 5% milk. After washing six times with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membranes were exposed to HRP substrates for 5 min. SuperSignal West Pico substrate detection kit was used for the detection of SREBP proteins, and ECL detection kit was used for the other proteins. All incubations and washes were performed at 37 °C. Exposures to blue-sensitive autoradiography x-ray films (Midwest Scientific, St. Louis, MO) were between 1 and 30 min in duration. X-ray films were scanned, and the intensity of bands was determined using the image processing and analysis software, Image J (1.34s, National Institutes of Health). Determination of FPP—Cells were incubated for 18 h with 25 μm lovastatin. FPP, 10 μm, was added per well for an additional hour in the continued presence of lovastatin. After the incubation cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and collected by low speed centrifugation. Cells were then extracted with butanol/75 mm ammonium hydroxide/ethanol, 1:1.25:2.75 (v/v), and processed for determination of FPP mass by high-performance liquid chromatography as described previously (16Tong H. Holstein S.A. Hohl R.J. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 336: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Cell Viability—The number of viable and non-viable cells remaining after incubation with the treatments was counted by Trypan Blue exclusion. In addition, cell viability was also assessed by the conversion of the tetrazolium compound, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, to its colored formazan product by mitochondrial dehydrogenase as described previously (17Murthy S. Mathur S.N. Varilek G. Bishop W. Field F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G94-102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative to control cells, none of the treatments at the concentrations examined, significantly altered the number of viable cells, milligrams of protein/well or mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity. To evaluate the effect of lovastatin on apoptosis, cells were incubated for 24 h with either M199 or M199 containing 10 μm lovastatin. Following incubation, cellular proteins were extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels and immunoblotted for caspase-3. Statistical Analyses—Differences between treatments were assessed for statistical significance using analysis of variance followed by Tukey's t test (18Kleinbaum D.G. Kupper L.C. Applied regression analysis and other multivariable methods. Duxberry Press, Wadsworth Publishing Company, Inc., Belmont, CA1978Google Scholar). Effect of Mevalonate Depletion on Fatty Acid Synthesis—To address the effect of mevalonate and its derivatives on fatty acid synthesis, CaCo-2 cells were depleted of mevalonate by incubation for 24 h with lovastatin. Lovastatin is a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in the rate-limiting step of the mevalonate pathway (Fig. 1). During the last 2 h of incubation with lovastatin, cells were pulsed with radiolabeled acetate, and the incorporation of the precursor into fatty acids was estimated. Results are shown in Fig. 2. Lovastatin caused a dose-dependent increase in fatty acid synthesis (Fig. 2A) and, as expected, decreased the synthesis of sterols (Fig. 2B). Lovastatin did not alter cell viability, cell number or protein concentration (data not shown). Thus, results were similar whether expressed per milligram of protein or per well. Neither were these results due to changes in apoptosis. In cells incubated with either medium alone or medium supplemented with 10 μm lovastatin there was little appreciable cleavage of caspase-3, an early marker of apoptosis (Fig. 2C). In contrast, etoposide, a known inducer of apoptosis, caused breakdown of the enzyme into its active products. Lovastatin was therefore used at 10 μm in all subsequent experiments. The incorporation of labeled acetate into fatty acids was linear with increasing times of incubation with the precursor and was greater in cells incubated with lovastatin (Fig. 2D). To examine the time-dependent effects of lovastatin on fatty acid synthesis, cells were incubated for increasing times with the inhibitor, and the incorporation of labeled acetate into fatty acids was estimated. Results are shown in Fig. 3 and demonstrate that fatty acid synthesis increased significantly in cells incubated with lovastatin only after 12 h of incubation. To confirm that the effects of lovastatin were due to mevalonate depletion, fatty acid synthesis was estimated in cells incubated with lovastatin and increasing concentrations of mevalonate. In results shown in Fig. 4, mevalonate prevented the effects of lovastatin on fatty acid synthesis in a dose-dependent manner. At the highest concentration examined, there was no difference in fatty acid synthesis between cells incubated with mevalonate alone and cells incubated with mevalonate and lovastatin. At this concentration, compared with control cells, mevalonate alone caused a modest increase in fatty acid synthesis.FIGURE 3Time-dependent effects of mevalonate depletion on fatty acid and sterol synthesis. Cells were incubated for increasing times with M199 (•) alone or with 10 μm lovastatin (○) and pulsed with radiolabeled acetate for the last 2 h of every incubation.

Oxysterol end products of the mevalonate pathway are ligands for LXRs and can therefore stimulate the expression of LXR target genes such as SREBP-1c and genes involved in fatty acid synthesis (2Repa J.J.

However, because lovastatin caused a marked inhibition in the synthesis of sterols, it is unlikely that oxysterol-mediated activation of LXR was responsible for the increase in fatty acid synthesis observed in mevalonate-depleted cells. Instead, these results suggest that derivatives of mevalonate upstream of sterols are involved in fatty acid synthesis. To identify the one or more derivatives, cells were incubated for 24 h with lovastatin alone or together with each of the isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway. These intermediates were added to cells in concentrations that are equivalent in terms of their conversion to downstream products in the pathway. Incorporation of labeled acetate into fatty acids was then determined.

https://openalex.org/W1970779889,"Phosphorylation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is a required step in signal deactivation. Rhodopsin, a prototypical GPCR, exhibits high gain phosphorylation in vitro whereby a hundred-fold molar excess of phosphates are incorporated into the rhodopsin pool per molecule of activated rhodopsin. The extent by which high gain phosphorylation occurs in the intact mammalian photoreceptor cell, and the molecular mechanism underlying this reaction in vivo, is not known. Trans-phosphorylation is a mechanism proposed for high gain phosphorylation, whereby rhodopsin kinase, upon phosphorylating the activated receptor, continues to phosphorylate nearby nonactivated rhodopsin. We used two different transgenic mouse models to test whether trans-phosphorylation occurs in the intact photoreceptor cell. The first transgenic model expressed a murine cone pigment, S-opsin, together with the endogenous rhodopsin in the rod cell. We showed that selective stimulation of rhodopsin also led to phosphorylation of S-opsin. The second mouse model expressed the constitutively active human opsin mutant K296E. K296E, in the arrestin-/- background, also led to phosphorylation of endogenous mouse rhodopsin in the dark-adapted retina. Both mouse models provide strong support of trans-phosphorylation as an underlying mechanism of high gain phosphorylation, and provide evidence that a substantial fraction of nonactivated visual pigments becomes phosphorylated through this mechanism. Because activated, phosphorylated receptors exhibit decreased catalytic activity, our results suggest that dephosphorylation would be an important step in the full recovery of visual sensitivity during dark adaptation. These results may also have implications for other GPCR signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2060055311,"Overexpression of the oncogenic serine/threonine kinase Pim-1 has been shown to induce chromosomal missegregation and polyploidy in prostate epithelial cell lines (1). Here we demonstrated that Pim-1-induced polyploidy develops in a passage-dependent manner in culture consistent with a stochastic mode of progression. Induction of chromosomal instability by Pim-1 was not restricted to prostate cells as it was also observed in telomerase-immortalized normal human mammary epithelial cells. Elevated levels of cyclin B1 protein, but not its messenger RNA, were evident in early passage Pim-1 overexpressing cells, suggesting that increased cyclin B1 levels contribute to the development of polyploidy. Furthermore, regulation of cyclin B1 protein and cyclin B1/CDK1 activity after treatment with anti-microtubule agents was impaired. Small interfering RNA targeting cyclin B1 reversed the cytokinesis delay but not the mitotic checkpoint defect in Pim-1 overexpressing cells. These results indicated that chronic Pim-1 overexpression dysregulates cyclin B1 protein expression, which contributes to the development of polyploidy by delaying cytokinesis."

Previously, we have shown that a photoreactive probe incorporated into a nascent polypeptide chain carrying a cryptic glycosylation sequence (Gln-Lys*-Thr, where Lys* carries the photoactivatable group) can be cross-linked to the mammalian STT3 in dog pancreas microsomes (11Nilsson I.

No significant photocrosslinking to other OST subunits was detected, and therefore our results strongly indicated that the active site of the OST complex is located in STT3. To further characterize the co-translational interaction between STT3 and nascent polypeptide chains, we have now studied the effect on nascent chain cross-linking of introducing bona fide Asn-Xaa-Thr glycosylation sites close to the Gln-Lys*-Thr cross-linking site. We find that cross-linking to STT3 is greatly reduced when a glycosylated Asn-Xaa-Thr site is present between positions -9 (N-terminal) and +4 (C-terminal) relative to the Gln-Lys*-Thr site. Additionally, we find that two closely spaced Asn-Xaa-Thr sites are less efficiently glycosylated than when they are placed further apart.

The pPL-sK polypeptide lacks residues 2-9 of natural pPL and therefore does not have any lysines in its signal sequence. In all nascent chains the lysine codons at position 91, 128, 146, 164, and 181 in pPL-sK were altered to a non-lysine codon, and this Lys-less construct was used as a basis for the following mutagenesis (11Nilsson I.

The second series pPL-sK(NKT) contains a glycosylation site N66KT and a second glycosylation site NST in the same positions as above.

The sequence of the endogenous glycosylation site,..NET.. at position 215-217, was replaced by the amino acid sequence..NNTT.. or..NSTNST.. to make Lep constructs with neighboring glycosylation sites. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. All mutants were confirmed by the sequencing of plasmid DNA at BM labbet AB (Furulund, Sweden). All cloning steps were done according to standard procedures using restriction enzymes from Promega. Transcription in Vitro—Transcription of full-length pPL-sK mRNAs from the preprolactin plasmid and full-length Lep mRNAs from the pGEM1 plasmid using SP6 RNA polymerase was performed as described previously (18Nilsson I.

The DNA template for in vitro transcription of truncated pPL-sK mRNAs was prepared using PCR to amplify a fragment from the plasmid. The 5′-primer was situated 100 bases upstream of the translation start, and the amplified fragment thus contained the SP6 transcriptional promoter. The 3′-primer was chosen to produce a truncated fragment ending at the desired codon (156), and no stop codon was included. Truncated mRNAs were transcribed from the amplified DNA fragments as described (13Liao S. Lin J. Do H. Johnson A.E.

Samples were photolyzed on ice for 15 min using a 500-W mercury arc lamp and filters that only transmitted light with a wavelength greater than 300 nm. After photolysis, membranes were sedimented through a 0.5 m sucrose cushion in a Beckman TLA ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 4 min at 100,000 rpm in a TLA100 rotor. For immunoprecipitation using STT3-A-specific antibodies, microsome pellets were resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA) containing 2% (w/v) SDS and placed at 55 °C for a minimum of 30 min. The samples were then diluted 10 times with buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 95 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 1.25% (v/v) Triton X-100, 0.2% (w/v) SDS) and precleared by rocking with protein A-Sepharose at room temperature for 60 min. The Sepharose beads were removed by sedimentation. STT3-A-specific antiserum was added to a precleared sample, and the samples were rocked overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was then added to each sample and incubated for a minimum of 2 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by sedimentation, washed twice with buffer B, and then washed a final time with the same buffer containing no detergent. The immunoprecipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized in a Bio-Rad FX Molecular Imager using the Quantity One Quantification software. Translations of full-length pPL-sK mRNAs and full-length Lep mRNAs were performed at 30 °C for 60 min as described (20Liljeström P. Garoff H. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 147-154Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in a total volume of 14 μl containing nuclease treated reticulocyte lysate, 40 units of RNase inhibitor, [35S]Met (0.7 μCi/μl), 70 μm concentration of each amino acid except Met, and 4 eq of CRMs. Samples were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and proteins were visualized in a Fuji FLA-3000 PhosphorImager using the Image Reader V1.8J/Image Gauge V 3.45 software. Using photocrosslinking from an engineered Gln-Lys*-Thr (QK*T) site in a nascent polypeptide chain, we have shown previously (11Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) that nascent secretory proteins are adjacent to the OST component STT3 during their translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. We also showed that the efficiency of photocrosslinking to STT3 reached a maximum when the QK*T site was positioned 70-100 amino acids from the P-site in the ribosome, in agreement with the observation that an Asn-Ser-Thr (NST) glycosylation acceptor site must be located at least 65-75 residues from the P-site for efficient glycosylation (21Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). To probe the interaction between STT3 and nascent chains in more detail, we sought to block photocrosslinking to the QK*T site by introducing a nearby bona fide Asn-Xaa-Thr (NXT) glycosylation acceptor site. In parallel, we also determined the inhibitory effect on glycosylation when two NXT sites are placed close to each other. In a first set of constructs, a potential glycosylation acceptor site (NST) was engineered at various positions either N- or C-terminal to the QK*T cross-linking site in the model secretory protein pPL, and the efficiency of photocrosslinking to STT3 was determined for each construct after in vitro translation of truncated mRNAs in the presence of dog pancreas rough microsomes (11Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In a second set, an NST site was placed either N- or C-terminal to an authentic glycosylation site (NKT), and the fraction of singly and doubly glycosylated molecules was determined after in vitro translation of full-length pPL in the presence of RM. Glycosylation Inhibits Cross-linking to STT3—For the first set of constructs, translocation intermediates for the photocrosslinking experiments were prepared by in vitro translation in the presence of SRP, endoplasmic reticulum microsomes, and the photoreactive ϵANB-Lys-tRNA. In these experiments the mRNAs were truncated within the coding region and hence lacked a stop codon, causing the ribosomes to stall at the 3′-end of the mRNA and form a stable ribosome-nascent chain complex (15Krieg U.C. Walter P. Johnson A.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8604-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), Fig. 1A. All nascent chains had the same length (156 residues), with 89 residues between the modified lysine in the QK*T site and the C-terminal end of the polypeptide in the ribosomal P-site; these nascent chains were long enough to be targeted efficiently to the translocon in the microsomal membrane and to be processed by the signal peptidase (data not shown). Because each mRNA contained a single Lys codon, each photoreactive nascent chain contained only one probe at position 67 in the QK*T site. Each of the potential NST glycosylation acceptor sites used in the constructs was efficiently glycosylated (Fig. 1B) except when the NST site was located 24 or 29 residues C-terminal of QK*T, too close to the nascent chain C terminus for efficient glycosylation (21Whitley P. Nilsson I.M. von Heijne G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6241-6244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). As shown previously (11Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), no glycans were transferred to a polypeptide containing only a QK*T sequence, but the nascent chain was photocrosslinked to STT3 (Fig. 1B). Only weak STT3 photocrosslinks (11Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) were detected for constructs where the asparagine in the NST sequence was placed between residues 57 and 71 (positions -9 to +5 relative to the Gln in the QK*T sequence) compared with constructs where the NST site was placed further away, Fig. 1, B and C. We conclude that the introduction of a bulky glycan moiety in a stretch of ∼15 residues surrounding the QK*T cross-linking site impairs the interaction between the nascent chain and STT3. Modification of Neighboring Glycosylation Sites—Because a glycosylated NST sequence placed near the QK*T sequence inhibits cross-linking to STT3, we considered the possibility that there may be a similar interference between two closely spaced bona fide NXT glycosylation acceptor sites. We therefore made a second set of constructs where a NST glycosylation site was located at the same distances from an NKT acceptor site as from the QK*T cross-linking site in the first set of constructs. Indeed, a decrease in the fraction of chains carrying two glycans was seen when the NST site was placed in positions -10 to +4 relative to the NKT site, Fig. 2. The inhibitory effect on glycosylation was less pronounced than the inhibition of STT3 photocrosslinking, but the sensitive region was approximately the same size and had the same asymmetry as the region identified by photocrosslinking. Only one of the two overlapping acceptor sites in the sequence NNTT was modified, Fig. 3A, and, for very closely spaced sites, glycosylation efficiency was found to depend to some extent on sequence context. Thus, the extent of double glycosylation of chains was smaller for two NNTNNT sites than for two NSTNST sites. Comparing the sequences NSTNKT and NKTNST, 45% of the NSTNKT-containing chains had two glycans, whereas 73% of NKTNST had two glycans (Fig. 2B). Clearly, when glycosylation efficiency is reduced, sequence context becomes important, as has been seen earlier for single, non-optimal glycosylation sites (22Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The sequence context surrounding two glycosylation sites seems in some cases more important than the distance between them; e.g. the glycosylation efficiency of the sequences NSTRNKT (18%) is lower than for the more closely spaced sequences NSTNKT (45%) (Fig. 2B) (positions of NST site are -4 and -3, respectively). The result for overlapping sites was confirmed using another well characterized model protein, Lep, which is normally located in the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. Lep is efficiently glycosylated on N215ET when expressed as a full-length protein in the presence of microsomes (17Johansson M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 239: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3B, only one site in the sequence NNTT in Lep was efficiently glycosylated, whereas both sites in construct with NST-NST sequence were glycosylated. The finding that a “cryptic” QK*T-site can be cross-linked to OST (11Nilsson I. Kelleher D.J. Miao Y. Shao Y. Kreibich G. Gilmore R. von Heijne G. Johnson A.E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 715-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) suggests that QXS/T sequences might affect the glycosylation efficiency of a nearby NXT/S acceptor site. To test this, we made a third set of pPL constructs with overlapping QXT/S and NXT/S sites, Fig. 3C. Indeed, a QXT sequence overlapping with the less than optimal NXS acceptor site (22Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Spitalnik S.L. Kasturi L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6363-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 23Mellquist J.L. Kasturi L. Spitalnik S.L. Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6833-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar) reduced glycosylation of the latter (compare constructs NTS and QNTS) but had no effect on the glycosylation efficiency of the optimal NXT sequence (construct QNTT and QNST). Here we have carried out a detailed study of how the interaction between a nascent chain and the STT3 subunit of the OST is affected by the presence of a nearby glycosylated residue. Two different assays of nascent chain interaction with STT3-photocrosslinking from a nearby QK*T site and glycosylation of a nearby NKT site yield similar results, a glycan located between 9 residues N-terminal and 4 residues C-terminal of the QK*T or the NKT target site markedly affects the nascent chain interaction with STT3. The simplest interpretation of these data is that the OST complex contacts roughly 15 residues of the nascent chain. Our data for constructs carrying two closely spaced bona fide glycosylation sites are in agreement with previous work where it has been noted that the smallest separation between neighboring glycosylated sites found so far in a natural protein (24Gavel Y. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 433-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) is three residues (a NHSENAT sequence in haptoglobin-1 (25Kurosky A. Barnett D.R. Lee T.H. Touchstone B. Hay R.E. Arnott M.S.

Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 660-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (1266) Google Scholar)). It may be that steric hindrance prevents more closely spaced sites from being glycosylated in the same nascent chain, as we found for the sequence NNTT in our constructs and as was found for the sequence NNST in human cholinesterase with the second, but not the first, Asn glycosylated (27Lockridge O. Bartels C.F. Vaughan T.A. Wong C.K. Norton S.E. Johnson L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 549-557Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the first, but not the second, Asn residue is glycosylated in vivo in the sequence NNTS in yeast invertase (28Reddy V.A. Johnson R.S. Biemann K. Williams R.S. Ziegler F.D. Trimble R.B. Maley F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6978-6985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of the overlapping acceptor sites to NNST in yeast invertase resulted in glycosylation of the second Asn residue (29Reddy A. Gibbs B.S. Liu Y.L. Coward J.K. Changchien L.M. Maley F. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Both the efficiency of transfer and the selection of a preferred site within closely spaced or overlapping glycosylation sites (29Reddy A. Gibbs B.S. Liu Y.L. Coward J.K. Changchien L.M. Maley F. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) therefore seem to be influenced by the preference of OST for Asn-Xaa-Thr sites relative to Asn-Xaa-Ser sites (22Shakin-Eshleman S.H.

By using confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, we examined trafficking of the neuronal and endocrine peptide precursor VGF that is stored in large dense core vesicles and undergoes regulated secretion. VGF cofractionated with secretory vesicle membranes but was not detected in detergent-resistant lipid rafts. Deletional analysis using epitope-tagged VGF suggested that the C-terminal 73-amino acid fragment of VGF, containing two predicted α-helical loops and four potential prohormone convertase (PC) cleavage sites, was necessary and sufficient with an N-terminal signal peptide-containing domain, for large dense core vesicle sorting and regulated secretion from PC12 and INS-1 cells. Further transfection analysis identified the sorting sequence as a compact C-terminal α-helix and embedded 564RRR566 PC cleavage site; mutation of the 564RRR566 PC site in VGF-(1-65): GFP:VGF-(545-617) blocked regulated secretion, whereas disruption of the α-helix had no effect. Mutation of the adjacent 567HFHH570 motif, a charged region that might enhance PC cleavage in acidic environments, also blocked regulated release. Finally, inhibition of PC cleavage in PC12 cells using the membrane-permeable synthetic peptide chloromethyl ketone (decanoyl-RVKR-CMK) blocked regulated secretion of VGF. Our studies define a critical RRR-containing C-terminal domain that targets VGF into the regulated pathway in neuronal PC12 and endocrine INS-1 cells, providing additional support for the proposed role that PCs and their cleavage sites play in regulated peptide secretion.

Regulated secretion of polypeptides from neuronal and endocrine cells, which relies on packaging of proteins into the appropriate vesicle pools within the cell, is a critical control point for regulating peptide levels and ultimately function. Polypeptide motifs that target cell surface proteins to specific vesicle populations or to discrete locations within the cell, such as the basolateral or apical surface of a polarized epithelial cell, have been relatively well characterized (1Bredt D.S. Cell. 1998; 94: 691-694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Protein domains that are responsible for targeting soluble proteins into the regulated release pathway appear to be more heterogeneous, and thus generalized sorting domains and consensus motifs have been more difficult to identify. Perhaps as a consequence, several models that explain targeting into the regulated secretory pathway by selective sorting and/or selective retention have been proposed (2Arvan P. Castle D. Biochem.

Constitutive secretory vesicles transit directly from the TGN to the plasma membrane where their protein contents are discharged. Secretory granules destined for regulated release undergo a process of maturation that redirects select proteins into smaller non-clathrin-coated vesicles of the constitutive pathway, and these are rapidly shuttled toward the plasma membrane. The remaining proteins that will undergo regulated release are often selectively aggregated, most likely in the mildly acidic, calcium-rich conditions of the TGN lumen. trans-Golgi network large dense core vesicle prohormone convertase carboxypeptidase E enhanced green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin prohormone convertase 2 prohormone convertase 1 neuropeptide Y proopiomelanocortin decanoyl chloromethyl ketone cycloheximide 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid deoxycholic acid phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. trans-Golgi network large dense core vesicle prohormone convertase carboxypeptidase E enhanced green fluorescent protein hemagglutinin prohormone convertase 2 prohormone convertase 1 neuropeptide Y proopiomelanocortin decanoyl chloromethyl ketone cycloheximide 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid deoxycholic acid phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.

Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1996; 96: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is secreted through the regulated release pathway in neuroendocrine PC12 and endocrine INS-1 cells (9Possenti R.

Functional studies based on the analysis of VGF mutant mice indicate that the encoded protein plays a critical role in the control over feeding and energy expenditure (13Hahm S. Mizuno T.M. Wu T.J. Wisor J.P. Priest C.A. Kozak C.A. Boozer C.N. Peng B. McEvoy R.C. Good P. Kelley K.A. Takahashi J.S. Pintar J.E. Roberts J.L. Mobbs C.V. Salton S.R.

VGF peptides have been identified in several endocrine organs including the pituitary and pancreas, as well as in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (11Salton S.R. Ferri G.L. Hahm S. Snyder S.E. Wilson A.J. Possenti R. Levi A. Front Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recent studies have further demonstrated that expression of the vgf gene is induced in response to hippocampus-dependent learning paradigms, and that the C-terminal VGF peptides regulate hippocampal neuronal excitability (15Alder J. Thakker-Varia S. Bangasser D.A. Kuroiwa M. Plummer M.R. Shors T.J. Black I.B. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 10800-10808Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ∼68-kDa VGF polypeptide is relatively rich in proline and glutamic acid, contains a number of paired (di)basic residues, and is differentially processed in a cell type-specific manner in neuronal, neuroendocrine, and endocrine cells (11Salton S.R. Ferri G.L. Hahm S. Snyder S.E. Wilson A.J. Possenti R. Levi A. Front Neuroendocrinol. 2000; 21: 199-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). This coupled with its localization in dense core secretory vesicles has suggested a similarity to the chromogranin/secretogranin family despite a lack of obvious similarities between their primary amino acid sequences. VGF, like chromogranin A, is not targeted to the regulated release pathway by the carboxypeptidase E (CPE) sorting receptor, 5E. Normant, S. R. J. Salton, and Y. P. Loh, unpublished observations.5E. Normant, S. R. J. Salton, and Y. P. Loh, unpublished observations. so to identify potential intracellular targeting motifs, we transfected a series of plasmid constructs encoding epitope-tagged VGF, various VGF deletions, and VGF-enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion proteins into neuroendocrine PC12 and endocrine INS-1 cells. Our studies suggest that both an N-terminal signal peptide-containing domain and the VGF 73-amino acid C-terminal domain, the latter with a predicted α-helical loop that contains a critical 564RRR566 prohormone convertase (PC) cleavage site, are required and sufficient for sorting and/or retention of VGF in LDCVs and secretion via the regulated release pathway. Plasmid Constructs—The parental hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged VGF was created by inserting the peptide sequence SYPYDVPDYAGT between Gly27 and Arg28 of the rat VGF polypeptide. Additional fulllength VGF constructs were created by subcloning the rat VGF coding sequence, with the translation stop codon replaced by a BglII site, into Kpn-Bam-cut pcDNA3.1/MycHisB (Invitrogen) or pEGFP-N1 (Clontech). To create the Myc deletion series shown in Fig. 1, restriction fragments of the rat VGF coding sequence were subcloned in-frame into the appropriate pcDNA3.1/MycHisB vector. A related series of constructs was made by truncating the full-length HA-tagged VGF using PCR primers to introduce termination codons following amino acids 177, 282, 367, 480, and 543 of rat VGF. The VGF:GFP constructs, which directly fuse VGF and GFP sequences in the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at the indicated sites, were created by PCR using pEGFP-N1 and the rat VGF cDNA (7Salton S.R. J.

Cells were re-fed, and selection in G418 (500 μg/ml) or hygromycin (100 μg/ml) was initiated 48-72 h after transfection. Mixed stable transfectants were selected in approximately 3 weeks, and aliquots were frozen; and cells, passaged for an additional one to five generations under antibiotic selection, were employed for the release and subcellular fractionation experiments. A series of constructs was analyzed by transient transfection of PC12 cells using an Amaxa Nucleoporator. For these experiments, aliquots of 5-6 × 106 cells were nucleoporated with 5-6 μg of plasmid DNA, according to manufacturer's instructions, and the cells were evenly divided into two 35-mm wells for measurement of basal and stimulated secretion 24-48 h post-transfection. Two different release experiments were carried out. For measurement of regulated release, “sister cultures” grown in parallel were rinsed and fed with serum-free medium. Medium was collected after 3 h (basal release), and cultures were then re-fed with either serum-free medium (basal release) or release was stimulated with serum-free media containing 50 mm KCl (PC12 cells), PMA (INS-1), or 8-bromo-cAMP (INS-1), and these were collected after 3 h and the cells saved for analysis. Equal volumes of media were precipitated with 0.1 volume of 100% trichloroacetic acid, 0.4% deoxycholic acid (DOC) for 1 h at 4°C and centrifuged, and the pellets were washed with acetone, dried, and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer. For select transfectants, to investigate whether the pattern of basal secretion was constitutive or “burst release,” cells were incubated in 10 ml of serum-free medium, and 1-ml aliquots were removed after 30, 120, 210, and 300 min of incubation, essentially as described (19El Meskini R.

After 2 or 4 days, PC12 cells were rinsed with serum-free medium and treated with serum-free medium (with or without 100 μm dec-RVKR-CMK) for 3 h (basal release) and finally with serum-free medium containing 50 mm KCl (with or without 100 μm dec-RVKR-CMK) for 3 h (stimulated release).

Gradients were centrifuged 274,000 × g for 3 h at 4°C in a Sorvall TH641 rotor and were fractionated from the top. Each of the 11 1-ml fractions was precipitated with trichloroacetic acid/DOC as described above and resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar).

Lysates were made up to 1.2 m sucrose (3.9 ml), loaded in the bottom of a centrifuge tube, and overlaid with 5.4 ml of 1.1 m sucrose and 2.7 ml 0.5 m sucrose. Following centrifugation at 29,000 rpm in a Sorvall TH641 rotor for 15 h at 4 °C, 1-ml fractions were collected from the top, diluted with an equal volume of TNE, precipitated at 4 °C by addition of 100% trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 20% trichloroacetic acid, and were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western analysis as described above. Preparation of LDCV Membranes and Protein Aggregation Analysis—PC12 post-nuclear supernatants were fractionated as described above, and VGF-containing LDCV fractions 5-10 were pooled. An aliquot was saved for later analysis, and the remainder was diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7, and centrifuged at 274,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a Sorvall TH641 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in the presence of 0.1% saponin under aggregating (10 mm MES, pH 6.4, 10 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm leupeptin) or non-aggregating (10 mm MES, pH 7.4, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1.2 mm leupeptin) conditions (26Glombik M.M.

Immunostaining and Confocal Microscopy—Cultures were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 4% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100. Immunostaining was carried out as described previously (28Benson D.L. Watkins F.H. Steward O. Banker G. J. Neurocytol. 1994; 23: 279-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) using the primary antibodies described above. Antibody binding was visualized either by incubating cells with a biotinylated secondary antibody followed by fluorescein-labeled streptavidin (both from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or with Texas Red-(Vector Laboratories) or Alexa-labeled (Molecular Probes) secondary antibodies. For all studies where two antibodies were used simultaneously, staining was compared with that obtained in cultures that were incubated with a single primary antibody and with cultures incubated with different combinations of secondary antibodies. Immunocytochemically identified proteins were localized using a Zeiss LSM 410 and a ×100, 1.4 N.A. oil immersion objective, an Ar/Kr laser, a red-reflecting dichroic beam splitter, and filters λ575-640 and λ515-540. Brightness and contrast settings for each label in double-labeled preparations were kept within close range of one another. Single optical sections were used to compare localization of two labels. Data obtained from two channels simultaneously using a dichroic beam splitter were compared with data obtained sequentially using one laser line to ensure that emission spectra were clearly separated. The extent of colocalization was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity along lines, 5-10 μm in length, drawn through the overlaid red and green images using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) (29Dickson T.C. Mintz C.D. Benson D.L. Salton S.R. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 1105-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Data were exported into Excel, and coincidence of intensity peaks (rather than levels of fluorescence) was assayed by determining correlation coefficients using Statview. Secondary Structure Analysis—For sequence analysis and structure prediction, we employed a suite of programs that are obtainable at cubic.bioc.columbia.edu/predictprotein/predictprotein.html. Included within this suite is a neural network algorithm, PHDsec, a secondary structure prediction paradigm with a multiple alignment-based neural net system that is cross-validated by 720 unique proteins. Predictions were also generated using a program, employing a “tandem” neural network containing two simulated networks, that has a higher reliability in detecting correct structures. 6M. J. Glucksman, unpublished data. Results were additionally validated using AGADIR and JPRED at the University of Dundee. VGF and Epitope-tagged VGF Are Localized in LDCVs and Secreted via the Regulated Release Pathway—VGF can be differentially processed, and the C terminus is rich in paired basic amino acids (7Salton S.R. J. Neurochem. 1991; 57: 991-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 9Possenti R. Eldridge J.D. Paterson B.M. Grasso A. Levi A.

Additionally, N-terminal signal peptide sequences and loop structures have been implicated in sorting, so two series of plasmids that contained either N- or C-terminal modifications were constructed. Sequence encoding rat VGF was modified to remove the stop codon and to fuse a Myc epitope to the C terminus (Fig. 1), and a series of deletion mutants with a C-terminal Myc epitope was generated as shown. In the other group of constructs, the N terminus of VGF was tagged with an HA epitope immediately C-terminal to the predicted signal peptide cleavage site, and a related series of deletion mutants was generated using the indicated restriction sites (Fig. 1). Plasmid constructs were transfected into PC12 cells, and individual G418-resistant clones or mixed stable populations were selected and analyzed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Neither the C-terminal Myc (data not shown) nor the N-terminal HA tag affected regulated release of epitope-tagged VGF or endogenous VGF (Fig. 2, panel A). Fractionation of PC12 post-nuclear supernatants by differential centrifugation on sucrose gradients indicated that VGF, chromogranin B, and HA-tagged VGF cosedimented, primarily in dense fractions that correspond to presumptive LDCVs. Synaptophysin, a marker of small clear vesicles, was found in fractions of lower density (Fig. 2, panel B). VGF and chromogranin B were also identified at the top of the gradient in soluble fractions corresponding to cytosol and possibly fractured vesicles, essentially as noted previously for VGF and for chromogranins A and B in similar density centrifugation experiments (9Possenti R.

Pept. 2002; 103: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Both N- and C-terminal VGF Sequences Are Required for Sorting into LDCV-like Particles by Confocal Microscopy—We used indirect immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy to examine PC12 cells that had been transfected with plasmid constructs encoding the various tagged, truncated forms of VGF. Full-length VGF, tagged either with Myc or with HA, was found to sort into LDCV-like particles, based on particle size and distribution, and lack of overlap with immunostaining for synaptophysin, a protein restricted to small clear or synaptic vesicles (Fig. 3, panel D). Progressive deletion of C-terminal VGF sequences changed the overall appearance of the VGF-Myc labeling pattern, with particles becoming less granular and more difficult to resolve (Fig. 3, panels A and B, right column, and data not shown), suggesting that N-terminal sequences alone, including the signal sequence, were insufficient to allow efficient sorting and/or retention in LDCV-like particles. None of the truncated VGF proteins appeared to codistribute with synaptophysin, suggesting that these polypeptides might be targeted to a vesicle population distinct from synaptic-like vesicles (Fig. 3 and data not shown). In contrast, a protein in which the N-terminal 80 amino acids of VGF were fused in-frame with the C-terminal 163 amino acids of VGF and a Myc tag was localized in a granular distribution that was strikingly reminiscent of intact VGF (Fig. 3, panel C, VGF1-80:VGF452-617), consistent with a possible requirement for both N- and C-terminal VGF sequences in the sorting and/or retention of these proteins in LDCV-like particles. N- and C-terminal VGF Domains Are Necessary and Sufficient to Target the Cytoplasmic Protein GFP into LDCV-like Particles—Because our results using confocal microscopy suggested that both N- and C-terminal VGF domains were required for targeting into LDCV-like vesicles, we investigated whether addition of VGF sequences to enhanced GFP, a cytosolic protein with no known sorting motifs, would be sufficient to similarly target the resultant fusion proteins. Plasmids encoding a series of VGF:GFP fusion proteins (see Fig. 1) were transfected into PC12 cells, and protein localization was examined by confocal microscopy and compared with native VGF using an antibody that recognizes an epitope contained within the region deleted in the GFP fusion proteins, or to chromagranin B which is also concentrated in LDCVs (31Schwarzenbrunner U. Schmidle T. Obendorf D. Scherman D. Hook V. Fischer-Colbrie R. Winkler H. Neuroscience. 1990; 37: 819-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The extent of codistribution was assessed by determining the correlation coefficient for the distribution of the two labels along a line drawn through the cell (see “Experimental Procedures” and TABLE ONE). The granular appearance of GFP labeling was most similar to that of VGF, and the extent of colocalization was highest when GFP was flanked by the VGF N-terminal sequence (amino acids 1-65) and either VGF C-terminal sequence 452-617 (TABLE ONE) or 452-544 (Fig. 4, panel A, and TABLE ONE). Colocalization was nearly absent when the C terminus was deleted altogether (VGF-(1-65):GFP) (Fig. 4, panel B and TABLE ONE). To determine whether the VGF N-terminal sequence conveyed unique targeting information or whether an unrelated leader sequence would be sufficient, the VGF signal peptide and N-terminal sequence (amino acids 1-65) were replaced by the Igκ signal peptide. As analyzed by confocal microscopy, the Igκ leader sequence behaved similarly to the native VGF N-terminal sequence. When Igκ was fused to GFP alone (Fig. 4, panel D), a fine granular distribution was obtained, slightly more diffuse than that seen with VGF-(1-65):GFP (Fig. 4, panel B), whereas fusion of Igκ to GFP:VGF-(452-617) resulted in a vesicular pattern similar to native VGF (Fig. 4, panel C, and TABLE ONE).TABLE ONEColocalization of native VGF or chromagranin B and GFP-tagged fusion proteins in PC12 cellsConstructCorrelation coefficient for native VGF vs. GFPCorrelation coefficient for chromagranin B vs. GFPVGF-(1-65):GFP:VGF-(452-617)0.680.71VGF-(1-65):GFP:VGF-(452-544)0.500.77VGF-(1-65):GFP0.260.48Igκ signal:GFP:VGF-(452-617)0.590.75Igκ signal:GFP:VGF-(452-544)0.160.64 Open table in a new tab Cellular fractionation and equilibrium density centrifugation were employed to better characterize the vesicle populations into which VGF:GFP fusion proteins were targeted.

In this study we have addressed post-synaptic contributions to assembly that may arise from the NMJ basement membrane with cultured myotubes. We show that the cell surface-binding LG domains of non-neural (muscle) agrin and perlecan promote AChR clustering in the presence of laminin-2. This type of AChR clustering occurs with a several hour lag, requires muscle-specific kinase (MuSK), and is accompanied by tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK and βAChR. It also requires conjugation of the agrin or perlecan to laminin together with laminin polymerization. Furthermore, AChR clustering can be mimicked with antibody binding to non-neural agrin, supporting a mechanism of ligand aggregation. Neural agrin, in addition to its unique ability to cluster AChRs through its B/z sequence insert, also exhibits laminin-dependent AChR clustering, the latter enhancing and stabilizing its activity. Finally, we show that type IV collagen, which lacks clustering activity on its own, stabilizes laminin-dependent AChR clusters. These findings provide evidence for cooperative and partially redundant MuSK-dependent functions of basement membrane in AChR assembly that can enhance neural agrin activity yet operate in its absence. Such interactions may contribute to the assembly of aneural AChR clusters that precede neural agrin release as well as affect later NMJ development.

Proteins bearing these domains are found in the basement membrane of the motoneuron endplate of skeletal muscle.

The basement membrane of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is enriched in laminins containing the α2 subunit, with predominance of α2β2γ1 in the mature endplate (3Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12601-12604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Laminins are critical for formation of basement membrane, self-assembling into cell-adherent polymers that serve as scaffolds for the tethering of agrins, nidogens, and perlecan, and are connected to a type IV collagen network (reviewed in Ref. 4Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Laminins have also been found to play a role in NMJ assembly, with different subunits contributing to their size, pre- and post-synaptic alignment, infoldings, and degree of ensheathment (4Yurchenco P.D. Amenta P.S. Patton B.L. Matrix Biol. 2004; 22: 521-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). The α1- and α2-laminins have been found to induce AChR clustering in vitro (6Sugiyama J.E.

Loss of the α2-laminin subunit is associated with reduced depths and complexity of the post-synaptic infoldings of the NMJ accompanied by defects of myelination and muscular dystrophy (3Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12601-12604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Agrins are heparan sulfate proteoglycans coded by a single gene and expressed as several variant forms because of alternative RNA splicing (11Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J.

Agrins that possess an N-terminal NtA domain (“LN-agrins”) bind with high affinity to the coiled-coil domain of γ1-laminins (12Burgess R.W. Skarnes W.C. Sanes J.R. J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of agrin at two loci within the laminin-type LG domain coding sequence gives rise to isoforms with different properties (11Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). The LN-agrins that possess a 4-amino acid residue insert within the chick A site (mammalian y site) confer heparin binding activity and a sequence of 8-19 residues within the chick B site (mammalian z site) affecting MuSK-dependent AChR clustering activity. The isoforms with the insertions are selectively released by the motor nerve termini to induce the coalescence and alignment of large AChR postsynaptic aggregates during NMJ assembly (11Gesemann M. Denzer A.J. Ruegg M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 625-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 17Lin W. Burgess R.W. Dominguez B. Pfaff S.L. Sanes J.R. Lee K.F. Nature. 2001; 410: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). The agrin variant lacking these insertions (A0B0/y0z0, muscle agrin), whose functions are poorly understood, is widely distributed in the basement membranes of non-neuronal tissues including the muscle sarcolemma (18Bezakova G. Ruegg M.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 295-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Perlecan is another basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan found in the NMJ whose C-terminal domain V contains three LG domains that interacts with α2β1 integrin and dystroglycan (19Bix G. Fu J. Gonzalez E.M. Macro L. Barker A. Campbell S. Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Kim J.K. Hook M. Reed C.C. Iozzo R.V. J.

The perlecan IG3 repeat in domain IV is the principal locus that binds to the G2 domain of nidogen-1. Nidogen-1 in turn binds to the laminin γ1-subunit, providing a bridge between the two proteins (21Hopf M. Gohring W. Mann K. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 22Brown J.C. Sasaki T. Gohring W. Yamada Y. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 250: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Perlecan mutations result in chondrodysplasia and myotonia, the latter because of its role in binding to acetylcholinesterase in the NMJ (23Arikawa-Hirasawa E. Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. Yamada Y. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this study we address the role of basement membrane components in AChR receptor assembly, examining relationships among neural agrin, non-neural agrin, perlecan, laminin-2 (“laminin-211”; Ref. 24Aumailley M.

Matrix Biol. 2005; 24: 326-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar), and type IV collagen. For this study we have used “minigene” versions of non-neural (nNA) and neural agrin (NA) that consist of the N-terminal (NtA) laminin-binding domain and the C-terminal LG domains that have been shown to possess biological activity (25Meier T.

Engvall E. Muller U. Ruegg M.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and that were chosen to simplify the analysis of domain contributions. We have also evaluated full-length perlecan and a protein consisting of the NtA domain fused to the LG domains of perlecan (NP). We report that the minigene version of non-neural agrin and that full-length and fusion versions of perlecan induce AChR clustering when bound to laminin-2. Clustering induced by these proteins is MuSK-dependent and requires laminin polymerization. Finally, type IV collagen stabilizes those clusters requiring laminin conjugation. Collectively, the findings reveal new roles of basement membrane in the promotion and stabilization of AChR clusters that may be relevant for understanding neuromuscular development. Chick Minigene Neural—Chick minigene neural (containing the A4B8 insertions) agrin (pCepN25C954,8His) and non-neural (A0B0) (pCepN25C950,0His) agrin plasmids were used to express protein with an N-terminal sequence containing a His6 tag, NtA domain, and the first follistatin repeat fused to the C-terminal neural or non-neural three G-repeats (11Gesemann M.

The NtA-FS.1 construct and minigene versions of NA and nNA (pCepN25C954,8His and pCepN25C950,0His, respectively) were transfected into adenovirus-transformed HEK 293 cells (ATCC CRL 1573) with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Clones stably expressing recombinant agrin proteins were expanded and secreted protein was affinity purified by His-Select HC Ni-affinity Gel (Sigma) chromatography. Laminin-2—Recombinant laminin-2 heterotrimers, both wild-type furin-processed (rLm2) and with LG domains deleted (rLm2ΔG1-5), were prepared and purified as described (7Smirnov S.P. McDearmon E.L.

Sasaki, MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) as a template with the sense primer 5′-GTCAGATCTCTGCAGGTGCCAGAGCGA-3′ and antisense primer 5′-GTAGGATCCTGAGGGGCAGGGCCGTGT-3′. The resulting expression construct encoded a signal sequence, NtA, and the FS domain of chick agrin followed by domain V (nucleotide 9518 until the poly(A) signal including the 3′ untranslated region). Positive 293 cell clones were selected and serum-free media of the clone was collected and concentrated by a factor of 30 by ultrafiltration with a 100,000 MWECO filter (Millipore). Nidogen-1—A pCIS vector encoding full-length mouse nidogen-1 (gift of Rupert Timpl, MPI for Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany) was used to stably transfect 293 cells. Secreted protein was purified from medium by metal chelating chromatography (27Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Krieg T. Engel J. Chu M-L.

Rabbit antiserum specific for chick agrin was used at a dilution of 1:300 for immunostaining and immunoblotting. Rabbit antiserum specific for MuSK was used for immunoprecipitation of protein and immunoblotting at a 1:500 dilution.

The concentration of NP was determined by comparing immunoblots of aliquots with known amounts of recombinant NtA with anti-agrin polyclonal antibody. A solid-phase assay was used to detect laminin-2 binding to the NtA domain of agrin. nNA was coated onto plastic wells at 10 μg/ml, and unbound sites were blocked with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS containing 0.06% Triton X-100 (blocking buffer). Recombinant Lm2 was incubated in the blocking buffer on the mini-agrin plate for 1 h at room temperature. For competition, recombinant Lm2 was mixed with dilutions of NtA. Binding was detected with anti-α2G laminin polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml) followed by incubation with a 1:1000 dilution of protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma). Absorbance (492 nm) was measured on a Spectrafluor (Tecan) plate reader after color development with o-phenylenediamine. Binding of perlecan and NP to laminin-2 was evaluated in a solid phase assay in which Lm2 was coated on 96-well plates as above, blocked with 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with perlecan or NP for 1 h at room temperature. Bound proteins were labeled with rabbit anti-perlecan antibody (5 μg/ml) and detected with anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Mouse C2C12 (6Sugiyama J.E. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D.

Myotubes were incubated with recombinant proteins diluted into fusion medium after 3-5 days (6Sugiyama J.E. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). AChR clusters were labeled by adding 5 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate/α-bungarotoxin (Molecular Probes) to live myotubes for 1 h, washed, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS (15 min at room temperature), and immunostained as described (6Sugiyama J.E. Glass D.J. Yancopoulos G.D. Hall Z.W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Digital fluorescent images of myotubes were recorded with a 12-bit CCD camera from a ×20 objective microscope using 2 × 2 binned fields (corresponding to 650 × 515 pixels after binning; 0.672 μm/pixel) using IPLab 3.5 (Scanalytics, Inc.). AChR clusters were counted if they contained more than a 3 × 3 group of contiguous pixels with a minimum mean pixel intensity at least 3 times background intensity. Clusters were counted from 10 field images for determination of average density and mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Cluster density was expressed as the number of clusters per (437 × 233 μm) imaged field for C2C12 myotubes (which were densely distributed and filled the fields) or as the number of clusters per μm2 of projected myotube surface for MuSK-/- myotubes (which were more sparsely distributed). MuSK-/- clusters were additionally evaluated for immunostaining to the AChR α-subunit (mAb 398, Chemicon) and counted when BTX staining co-localized with that of the antibody. AChR Phosphorylation (9Marangi P.A. Wieland S.T. Fuhrer C. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)—Myotubes were washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA in PBS containing a protease/phosphatase inhibiting mixture (Sigma). The supernatant was incubated with biotin-bungarotoxin (5 mg/ml) for 1 h, then streptavidin-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma) for 1 h (room temperature) to precipitate AChRs. After washing, precipitates were electrophoresed (9% acrylamide SDS-PAGE) under reducing conditions and transferred to membranes that were immunoblotted with monoclonal antibodies 4G10 (Upstate Biotech) and PY-20 (Transduction Labs) and detected by ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). MuSK Phosphorylation—Myotubes were washed with cold PBS and solubilized by incubation for 15 min on ice in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1:500 anti-MuSK antisera. Antibody-bound proteins were precipitated with 30 μl of a 30% suspension of protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) in 0.14 m sodium phosphate, pH 8.3, for 2 h at 4 °C and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology). Chemiluminescence—Chemiluminescence intensity was measured from films or blots using digitalized images recorded with a Chemidoc-XRS CCD camera (Bio-Rad). Basement Membrane Binding Interactions—Laminin-2, like other polymerizing laminins, is thought to exist as a cell surface-associated network tethered to nidogens and agrins, with nidogen bound to perlecan and (not shown) type IV collagen (Fig. 1). Recombinant laminin-2 (furin-processed form found in muscle and other tissues), minigene versions of nNA and NA, isolated NtA domain, perlecan derived from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm matrix, and NP were used in this study (Fig. 1b). NA has previously been shown to possess AChR clustering and NMJ assembly properties of full-length agrin, whereas nNA was found to substantially ameliorate the dystrophic muscle histology and phenotype, prolonging animal survival when overexpressed in the muscle of laminin α2-deficient mice (25Meier T. Marangi P.A. Moll J. Hauser D.M. Brenner H.R. Ruegg M.A. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1998; 10: 3141-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 26Moll J. Barzaghi P. Lin S. Bezakova G. Lochmuller H. Engvall E. Muller U. Ruegg M.A. Nature. 2001; 413: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins and their binding interactions were characterized (supplemental Fig. S1). Laminin-2 binding to nNA was inhibited by excess NtA fragment. Native perlecan binding to laminin-2 depended upon the presence of nidogen-1, whereas NP binding to laminin-2 depended upon interaction through the chimeric NtA domain. Conditioned medium of cultured C2C12 myotubes contained nidogen-1 (1-2 μg/ml) but otherwise contained little or none of the basement membrane components described in this work (data not shown). Thus, it is unlikely that any of the effects described here are based on laminins, agrins, perlecan, or type IV collagen released from the myotubes. Agrin-induced Acetylcholine Receptor Clustering—Myotubes were incubated for 18 h with laminin-2, NA, and/or nNA (Fig. 2). AChR clusters were visualized with fluorescent bungarotoxin (Fig. 2, a and b). Laminin-2 induced AChR clusters severalfold above spontaneous levels (∼7 clusters/×20 field), whereas NA (1 μg/ml) induced AChR clustering to even higher levels. Whereas nNA (1 μg/ml) failed to affect clustering as a single added component, a striking increase in the number of AChR clusters was observed when myotubes were treated with a mixture of nNA and laminin-2. The highest clustering levels were achieved when NA, nNA, and laminin-2 were incubated as a mixture. Plots of the AChR cluster density dependence on ligand concentration were empirically found to be well fitted (solid lines) using the simple binding equation substituted with terms for clustering, i.e. c = (Cm · L)/(EC50 + L), where c is the cluster density, L is the ligand concentration, Cm is the maximal possible cluster density, and EC50 is the ligand concentration that induces half-maximal AChR clustering. The average EC50 of laminin-2 was determined to be 3.7 nm (±1.3 nm, n = 4). This value did not change for laminin when NA, nNA, or a mixture of NA and nNA were added to the laminin. AChR cluster density also depended upon the concentration of agrins (Fig. 3). Maintaining laminin-2 constant at 28 nm (20 μg/ml; which produces a near-saturating clustering effect), nNA was observed to substantially increase cluster density from 50 to 131/field, reaching near maximal values by 0.8 nm nNA (Fig. 3a). The EC50 for nNA in this paradigm was 0.05 nm compared with 4 nm for laminin-2 alone. This higher activity was comparable with that observed for NA alone (0.06 nm) as well as NA in the presence of laminin-2 (0.11 nm NA, Fig. 3b). The maximal clustering observed when NA was mixed with laminin-2 (254/field at 8 nm NA, 28 nm laminin-2) was greater than the sum of the maximal laminin (50/field) and maximal NA (101/field) values, interpreted that the laminin enhancement was synergistic. Maximal clustering was achieved at NA or nNA molar concentrations substantially below that of laminin, indicating that the population of molecules in the complex likely contained many more laminins than agrins. Furthermore, we found that if Lm2ΔG1-5 and intact laminin were mixed in a 9:1 ratio, almost no loss of AChR clustering was observed despite a 10-fold dilution of cell-interactive laminin G-domains (data not shown). This suggests that the relatively high laminin concentration to mediate clustering is primarily needed to drive polymerization. The data further reveal that NA induces clustering through both a laminin-dependent and laminin-independent mechanism but that nNA is strictly laminin-dependent, i.e. that NA possesses a unique activity because of its B/z splice insert that is laminin-independent and that is superimposed upon a laminin-dependent activity common to both agrins. To evaluate this further, the contributions of NtA domain interactions, laminin polymerization, and laminin LG domains to AChR clustering were examined (Fig. 4). nNA and NA were separately incubated with laminin-2 in the presence of either a molar excess of the NtA domain to inhibit agrin binding to laminin or with a molar excess of laminin fragment E1′ to inhibit polymerization of laminin (7Smirnov S.P.

There were several expectations. First, E1′ should block clustering dependent upon laminin polymerization, i.e. all clustering induced by either laminin or nNA but only the laminin-dependent component of NA. Second, the NtA fragment should block clustering that depends upon tethering to laminin through the coiled-coil, i.e. all clustering induced by nNA but not that of laminin alone and only the laminin-dependent component of NA. Third, if laminin-mediated clustering requires laminin anchorage to the cell surface through its own LG domains, then deletion of the laminin LG domains should prevent all laminin-associated clustering. When the AChR cluster densities were compared for the different conditions, E1′ treatment to inhibit laminin polymerization was found to reduce the laminin-2-induced AChR density to spontaneous (baseline) levels and the high nNA/laminin density to that of the bas"
https://openalex.org/W2048416341,"A microsecond-resolved absorption spectrometer was developed to investigate the elementary steps in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation reaction of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) at ambient temperature. The kinetic absorption spectra of HRP upon the mixing with various concentrations of H2O2 (0.5-3 mm) were monitored in the time range from 50 to 300 μs. The time-resolved spectra in the Soret region possessed isosbestic points that were close to those between the resting state and compound I. The kinetic changes in the Soret absorbance could be well fitted by a single exponential function. Accordingly, no distinct spectrum of the putative intermediate between the resting state and compound I was identified. These results were consistent with the proposal that the O-O bond activation in heme peroxidases is promoted by the imidazolium form of the distal histidine that exists only transiently. It was estimated that the rate constant for the breakage of the O-O bond in H2O2 by HRP is significantly faster than 1 × 104 s-1.

Heme peroxidases are oxidative metabolizing enzymes ubiquitously distributed in plants, animal tissues, and micro-organisms and oxidize a broad range of substrates by utilizing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)asan oxidant (1Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York1999Google Scholar, 2Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 51: 107-162Crossref Google Scholar). The substrates are oxidized by two common intermediates of heme peroxidases called compounds I and II. Compound I is formed upon the activation of H2O2 with the resting enzymes and contains an oxyferryl porphyrin π-cation radical (3Penner-Harn J.E. Eble K.S. Mcmurry T.J. Renner M. Balch A.L. Groves J.T. Dawson J.H. Hodgson K.O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 7819-7825Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Compound I oxidizes the substrate and converts to compound II containing an oxyferryl heme, which returns to the resting state by oxidizing another molecule of the substrate. Heme peroxidases develop an efficient mechanism to capture and activate H2O2 rapidly and specifically. The bimolecular rate constant for the formation of compound I (1.7 × 107 m-1 s-1) is close to that of the diffusion-limited reactions (∼109 m-1s-1) (4Dunford H.B. Hewson W.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The H2O2 activation conducted by heme peroxidases produces little reactive oxygen radicals as side products. Thus, intensive experimental and theoretical investigations have been conducted to reveal the molecular mechanism for the H2O2 activation steps of heme peroxidases (5Isaac I.S. Dawson J.H. Esssays Biochem. 1999; 34: 51-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Ozaki S. Roach M.P. Matsui T. Watanabe Y. Acc. Chem.

The heme-peroxidase reactions are also important as models for other heme enzymes, such as catalase-peroxidase, cytochrome P450, and cytochrome oxidase, whose catalytic reactions involve heme species similar to those found in compounds I and II. The molecular mechanism of the H2O2 activation by heme peroxidases was first hypothesized by Poulos and Kraut (8Poulos T.L. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8199-8205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Poulos T.L. Freer S.T. Alden R.A. Edwards S.L. Skogland U. Takio K. Eriksson B. Xuong N. Yonetani T. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 575-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of cytochrome c peroxidase. They propose that the conserved His-52 in the distal heme pocket assists the formation of a putative iron-peroxide complex by deprotonating H2O2 and the heterolysis of the O-O bond by protonating to the outer oxygen (Fig. 1A). They further propose that an electrostatic interaction between Arg-48 and the outer oxygen atom promotes the O-O bond heterolysis. The proposal has been examined by numerous mutational studies on the distal His and Arg residues of cytochrome c peroxidase (10Erman J.E. Vitello L.B. Miller M.A. Shaw A. Brown K.A. Kraut J.

In addition, the roles of the hydrogen bonding network that regulates the protonation state of the distal His were investigated for HRP (19Nagano S. Tanaka M. Watanabe Y. Morishima I. Biochem.

Despite the progressed understanding on the functions of the distal residues of heme peroxidases, the putative precursor for compound I (the iron-peroxide complex) has never been identified at ambient temperature for wild type enzymes. It has been known that the lifetime of the precursor at room temperature is shorter than the dead time of conventional stopped-flow devices (several ms). The cryogenic stopped-flow experiments on HRP, using methanol or Me2SO as cryosolvents, suggest the presence of the precursory state (24∼26). The subsequent theoretical study assigned the spectrum of the state to the ferric peroxide anion complex (Fe3+-OOH) (27Harris D.L. Loew G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10588-10594Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The cryoradiolysis experiment on the ferrous oxygen-bound form of HRP identifies the Fe3+-OOH species in the low spin form, which however, cannot convert to compound I and directly returns to the resting state upon the temperature increase (28Gazyna Z. FEBS Lett. 1979; 106: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 29Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol.

A similar cryoradiolysis experiment based on x-ray crystallographic analysis, however, detected the formation of compound I (30Bergund G.I. Carlsson G.H. Smith A.T. Szöke H. Hendriksen A. Hajdu J. Nature. 2002; 417: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). The stopped-flow experiments at room temperature for the formation process of compound I in the Arg-38→ Leu mutant (R38L) of HRP suggest the existence of an intermediate in the ferric high spin state (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N.

Soc. 1996; 118: 10588-10594Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The low temperature results for the polyethylene-glycolated HRP suggests the high spin intermediate (31Ozaki S. Inada Y. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8020-8025Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Thus, although several cryogenic experiments have detected the putative precursory state, the information is conflicting, and no evidence has been presented that the species is relevant at room temperature. A clue to understand the conflicting information is proposed by Denisov et al. (29Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Egawa et al. (32Egawa T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Nagano S. Shimada H. Ishimori K.

To explain the observation that the Fe3+-OOH species created by the cryoradiolysis of the ferrous oxygen-bound HRP cannot convert to compound I, Denisov et al. point out that the species lacks a proton required for the O-O bond heterolysis (29Denisov I.G.

They detected the Fe3+-OOH species only in alkaline conditions and explain that the absence of the Nδ proton the distal His decelerates the conversion of the Fe3+ from -OOH species (Fig. 1B, (c)) to compound I (Fig. 1B, (e)) due to the lack of a proton for the O-O bond heterolysis. Egawa et al. (32Egawa T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Nagano S. Shimada H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. J. Biol.

To confirm the Poulos-Kraut mechanism and its implementation by Denisov et al. and Egawa et al., it is important to demonstrate the absence of the Fe3+-OOH species in the formation process of compound I upon the mixing of HRP and H2O2. In our previous study, we utilized a rapid freeze-quench device that can initiate and terminate biological reactions within 200 μs and monitored the compound I formation process of HRP (35Tanaka M. Matsuura K. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H. Morishima I. Biophys. J. 2003; 84: 1998-2004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The EPR spectrum for the sample trapped at 200 μs after mixing H2O2 and HRP shows the complete formation of compound I (35Tanaka M. Matsuura K. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Ishimori K. Hori H.

In the current study, we further improved the time resolution of the observation system, and developed a new kinetic absorption spectrometer having a 50-μs time resolution. The spectrometer consisted of a continuous fast-flow mixer using a stainless mixing plate sandwiched by quartz glasses (36Akiyama S. Takahashi S. Kimura T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nishikawa Y.

Utilizing this apparatus to the reaction of HRP with H2O2, we confirmed that the Fe3+-OOH species could not be identified, even with the improved time resolution.

Horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Wako, and isozymes B and C were purified using the reported method at 4 °C (37Shannon L.M. Kay E. Lew J.Y. J. Biol.

In brief, the enzyme was dialyzed against 5 mm acetate buffer at pH 4.4, transferred to a CM-cellulose column, and eluted with a gradient of the acetate concentration until reaching a concentration of 100 mm. The eluted sample was dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer at pH 8.4 and applied to a DEAE-cellulose column and eluted with the same buffer. The purified enzyme containing isozymes B and C possessed the RZ value of 3.3 and was used for the kinetic measurements. Experimental Setup—The T-shaped flow mixer originally reported by Akiyama et al. (36Akiyama S. Takahashi S. Kimura T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nishikawa Y. Fujisawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) was employed (Fig. 2A). Two solutions to be mixed were introduced in syringes and were supplied continuously to the mixing cell, which was constructed with a stainless mixing plate and two quartz plates. The two solutions were accelerated in the narrow channel (35 × 100 μm), created turbulent flow at the center of the T-shaped channel, and were mixed. The mixed solution flowed inside the 100-μm square channel, where reactions were monitored using optical absorption spectroscopy. The efficiency of the mixer was initially evaluated by observing the acid-base discoloration reaction. A solution containing 1 mg/ml bromocresol purple (BCP) and 10 mm sodium hydroxide at pH 12 and a solution of 50 mm sodium succinate at pH 4.0 were injected into the mixer at the flow rate of 0.084 ml/s for each solution (Fig. 2A, inset). The discoloration of BCP implied the mixing. The line speed of the mixed solution was 16.8 mm/ms along the flow channel. The distance along the channel required for the complete discoloration was <500 μm, which corresponded to 30 μs. Thus, kinetic absorption spectra in the time domain after 50 μs can be reliably observed using the system. The optical setup of the developed system was shown schematically in Fig. 2B. The defocused white light from a xenon lamp (Hamamatsu, 150 W) was passed through the flow channel, and the image of the channel was focused at the entrance slit of an imaging spectrograph (Chromex, model number 250is). A heat absorbing filter was placed in front of the slit. The image of the channel was dispersed by the spectrograph and was detected by a cooled charge-coupled device (Princeton Instruments, TE/CCD 1340/400) as the two-dimensional image. The axes of the image parallel and perpendicular to the entrance slit corresponds to the time after the mixing and wavelength, respectively. The kinetic absorption spectra (A) were calculated by comparing the two-dimensional images for the sample (I) and for the buffer reference (I0) after subtracting the dark image (D) based on the following equation. A=-logI-DI0-D(Eq. 1) Approximately 25 s were required for a measurement of the time-resolved spectra in the Soret region, with optical densities of ∼0.04, which was achieved at the HRP concentration of 50 μm. The wavelength calibration of the spectra was performed with the bright lines of a mercury lamp. Reaction of HRP with Peroxides—A buffered solution containing the ferric form of HRP and another buffered solution containing various concentrations of H2O2 were passed through cellulose syringe filters (0.22 μm pore) and were introduced into 5-ml gas-tight syringes. They were injected into the mixer at the rate of 0.084 μl/ms for each solution. The line speed of the mixed solution in the observation channel was 16.8 mm/ms. The buffer employed for the kinetic measurements was 50 mm sodium phosphate at pH 7. All kinetic measurements were performed at room temperature (∼20 °C). Construction of the Kinetic Absorption Spectrometer for the Microsecond Time Domain—We constructed a new kinetic spectrometer, which could monitor biological reactions in the time domain from 50 to 300 μs based on the T-shaped flow mixer originally reported by Akiyama et al. (36Akiyama S. Takahashi S. Kimura T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Nishikawa Y. Fujisawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1329-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and the imaging spectrograph with the two-dimensional detection system (Fig. 2, A and B). We could reduce the mixing time to <50 μs by constructing the small flow channel with a width of 100 μm. A preliminary report of the improved mixer has been described previously (38Kimura T. Takahashi S. Akiyama S. Uzawa T. Ishimori K. Morishima I. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 11596-11597Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The mixing cell requires the continuous supply of sample solutions and a rather large amount of samples; however, the sample consumption was reduced considerably by utilizing imaging spectrograph that could monitor the entire observation channel simultaneously. A similar kinetic observation system developed independently has been reported recently (39Roder H. Maki K. Cheng H. Shastry M.C.R. Methods (Duluth). 2004; 34: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The mixing dead time of the system could be roughly estimated to be <50 μs as demonstrated by the discoloration reaction of the pH-sensitive dye (Fig. 2A, inset). For the quantitative estimation of the mixing rates, we monitored the reduction reaction of [Ir4+Cl6-]2- by [Fe2+(CN)6]4- (40Jacobs S.A. Nemeth M.T. Kramer G.W. Ridley T.Y. Margerum D.W. Anal. Chem. 1984; 56: 1058-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We confirmed that kinetic traces monitored at the absorbance peak for [Ir4+Cl6]2- showed a single exponential decay in the time domain after 50 μs and that the apparent rate constants obtained by fitting the kinetic traces reproduced the reported values in the range of <1 × 104 s-1 (see “Supporting Information” in the on-line supplemental text). We concluded that the device could correctly monitor the process after 50 μs of mixing and at rate constants <1 × 104 s-1. Compound I Formation in the Microsecond Time Domain—To investigate the sub-ms time range in the formation of compound I in HRP, the reaction of ferric HRP and 1 mm H2O2 at pH 7 was observed with the developed apparatus. The obtained spectra are shown in Fig. 3A. The absorption maximum in the Soret region of the ferric resting enzyme is 403 nm, whose intensity is reduced without changing the wavelength upon the addition of H2O2. An isosbestic point was observed at 430 nm, which is identical to that between ferric resting enzyme and compound I (41Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is another isosbestic point at 357 nm between the resting state and compound I (41Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The corresponding isosbestic point in Fig. 3 is obscure due to the low signal to noise ratio and does not allow a further discussion. These spectral changes are characteristic of the formation of compound I. We next utilized the higher concentration of H2O2, which would result in a larger accumulation of the intermediate; however, the time-resolved absorption spectra after 50 μs are almost identical to that of compound I, even with 3 mm H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Thus, we could not identify a distinct spectrum for the putative intermediate. In an attempt to lengthen the lifetime of the intermediate, we utilized tert-butylhydroperoxide as an oxidant, because the formation rate of compound I using the oxidant is depressed >1000-fold compared with that of H2O2. The microsecond time-resolved absorption spectra for the reaction of HRP and 250 mm tert-butylhydroperoxide only showed the slow formation of compound I (not shown). We therefore concluded that the initial association of the alkyl peroxide to HRP is reduced without drastically affecting the lifetime of the intermediate. Although we could not identify a distinct spectrum for the primary intermediate, it could be possible to infer the elementary steps of the compound I formation using the Michaelis-Menten analysis. We therefore investigated the H2O2 concentration dependence of the formation process of compound I. The time course of the absorbance at 403 nm for all concentrations of H2O2 utilized could be fitted well with a single exponential function (Fig. 4A). The apparent rate constants (kobs) were determined from the fitting and plotted against the H2O2 concentration as shown in Fig. 4B. The plot shows the saturation behavior similar to that expected for the Michaelis-Menten plot; however, it is more likely that the saturation was caused by the mixing process of the current mixer. In fact, the plot in reduction Fig. 4B is very similar to that observed for the reaction of [Ir Cl6]2 (see “Supporting Information” in the on-line supplemental text). We concluded that the lifetime of the primary intermediate should be significantly shorter than the time resolution of the device (1 × 104 s-1). We succeeded in reducing the observation dead time of the kinetic absorption spectrometer to <50 μs with the continuous flow mixing system. The spectra for the resting state and compound I of HRP obtained by the new system are identical to those obtained by the conventional system (41Schonbaum G.R. Lo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3353-3360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The absorption spectra detected by the device were reliable in the time domain after 50 μs. Furthermore, the second order rate constant estimated from kobs at 0.5 mm of H2O2, which was free from the mixing artifact, was ∼2 × 107 m-1 s-1. The constant agreed well with the value of the stopped-flow experiment (1.7 × 107 m-1 s-1) (4Dunford H.B. Hewson W.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2949-2957Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Using the developed system, we systematically investigated the reaction between HRP and H2O2; however, we could not identify a distinct absorption spectrum for the putative intermediate before the formation of compound I, even with the high concentration of H2O2. Considering that the Fe3+-OOH species of HRP possesses a Soret maximum at 419 nm and is distinct from the resting enzyme possessing a maximum at 403 nm (29Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we concluded that the Fe3+-OOH compound did not exist in the time domain after 50 μs. There remained a possibility that the species possessing a spectrum similar to that of the resting enzyme could exist. As reported for the R38L mutant of HRP, the Fe3+-HOOH species is considered to possess a Soret maximum ∼404 nm (16Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 136-142Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The saturation behavior of kobs against H2O2 concentration could also suggest the presence of the intermediate (Fig. 4B); however, the saturation was more likely caused by the limitation of the mixing time (see “Supporting Information” in the on-line supplemental text). Thus, although there existed the possibility that the Fe3+-HOOH species was present at a low concentration in the time domain after 50 μs, we concluded that the lifetime of the species should have been much faster than the highest rate detectable by the current device (1 × 104 s-1). The absence of the Fe3+-OOH species in the time domain after 50 μs did not agree with some of the previous results. The cryogenic stopped-flow experiments detected the intermediate in the compound I formation (24Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5714-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), which had been later assigned to the Fe3+-OOH species (27Harris D.L. Loew G.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 10588-10594Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). However, the rate constant for the O-O bond heterolysis estimated from the extrapolation of the low temperature data to room temperature is ∼103 s-1, which is significantly smaller than the value from the current study (>1 × 104 s-1). It should be noted that the small rate constant is cited in several recent reviews (2Veitch N.C. Smith A.T. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 2001; 51: 107-162Crossref Google Scholar, 23Hinter A.N.P. Raven E.L. Thorneley R.N.F. García-Cánovas F. Rodríguez-López J.N. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2002; 91: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Together with the observation that the Fe3+-OOH species created by reducing the ferrous oxygen-bound HRP at cryogenic temperature cannot convert to compound I (29Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we concluded that the Fe3+-OOH species observed previously was caused by the non-physiological solvent, temperature, and the method of initiating reactions. Although the current data do not provide direct evidence for the Fe3+-HOOH species, the absence of the Fe3+-OOH species with a detectable lifetime is rather consistent with the recent proposals on the activation of H2O2 by heme peroxidases (29Denisov I.G. Makris T.M. Sligar S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42706-42710Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 32Egawa T. Yoshioka S. Takahashi S. Hori H. Nagano S. Shimada H. Ishimori K. Morishima I. Suematsu M. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 41597-41606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It is explained that the lifetime of the Fe3+-OOH species in heme peroxidases is short, because the distal His becomes an unstable imidazolium cation after accepting a proton from H2O2 at the Nϵ site because of the conserved Asn residue (Asn-70 in HRP), stabilizing the Nδ proton (19∼21). We suggest that the O-O bond heterolysis in heme peroxidases is more likely approximated by a 1,2-proton shift from the inner to outer oxygen assisted by the distal His acting as the base catalyst (42Bruice T.C. Zipplies M.F. Lee W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4646-4649Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The current estimate for the lower limit of the O-O bond heterolysis (>1 × 104 s-1) has important implications for the heme peroxidase reaction cycle. It was reported that the Fe3+-HOOH species is the intermediate state for the compound I formation of R38L (17Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Smith A.T. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4023-4030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 18Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Lowe D. Heranndez-Ruiz J. Hiner J.A.N.P. Garcia-Canovas F. Thorneley R.N.F. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 11838-11847Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and that the rate constant for the heterolysis is 1.4 × 102 s-1. From our improved estimate of the rate of O-O bond cleavage, we can conclude that Arg-38 plays a more important role in the heterolysis than the assumed role based on the wrong estimate. Furthermore, the previous rate constant (∼103 s-1) was a basis for considering the O-O bond heterolysis as the rate-limiting step in turnover reactions of HRP with fast substrates (43Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Gilabert M.A. Tudela J. Thorneley R.N.F. Garcia-Canovas F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13201-13209Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Our data show that some other step or steps, such as electron transfer in the compound II-substrate complex (44Folkes L.K. Candeias L.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), are likely to be rate-limiting and not the O-O bond cleavage as previously stated (43Rodriguez-Lopez J.N. Gilabert M.A. Tudela J. Thorneley R.N.F. Garcia-Canovas F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 13201-13209Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In conclusion, the microsecond-resolved absorption spectrometer was developed, and the kinetic absorption spectra of HRP upon mixing with H2O2 were systematically investigated. Although the developed device possesses a significantly faster time resolution compared with other stopped-flow devices, it was still impossible to obtain evidence for the new intermediate before the formation of compound I. We estimate that the rate constant for the breakage of the O-O bond in H2O2 by HRP should be significantly faster than 1 × 104 s-1. Download .pdf (.28 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2107857455,"Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) shows many features of the metabolic syndrome. The strong genetic component makes it an excellent model to study the genetic background of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is believed to contribute to, or even underlie, the FCHL phenotype and is an interesting target tissue for gene expression studies. However, interpretation of adipose tissue gene expression experiments is complex since expression differences cannot only arise as a direct consequence of a genetic trait, but may also reflect an adaptation to metabolic influences at the cellular level. In the present study, we measured gene expression levels in cultured primary human preadipocytes from FCHL and control subjects. Since isolated preadipocytes were allowed to replicate for weeks under standardized conditions, the contribution of previous metabolic influences is rather small whereas genetic defects are preserved and expressed in vitro. The main finding was up-regulation of CD36/FAT in FCHL preadipocytes, confirmed in two independent groups of subjects, and a concomitant increase in CD36/FAT-mediated fatty acid uptake. CD36/FAT overexpression has previously been shown to be associated with other insulin-resistant states. The present data suggest that CD36/FAT overexpression in FCHL occurs very early in adipocyte differentiation and may be of genetic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2131967018,"We previously analyzed strand transfers catalyzed by human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 reverse transcriptase (RT) in a hairpin-containing RNA template system. In this system, RT produces a series of adjacent RNase H cuts before the hairpin base on the first, or donor template that clears a region of the donor, facilitating invasion by the second, or acceptor RNA. Here we analyze characteristics of the prominent cuts before the hairpin base and their role in strand transfers. Analysis of the template cleavage pattern during synthesis suggested that the RT performs DNA 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cuts while paused at the hairpin base and that these cuts contribute to creation of the invasion site. RT catalyzed similar cleavages on a substrate representing a paused cDNA-template intermediate. DNA 3′ end-directed secondary cuts, which require positioning of the polymerase active site downstream of the primer terminus, had previously not been specifically identified during synthesis.

RT is a p66/p51 heterodimer that possesses both RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity and RNase H activity. The polymerase and RNase H active sites reside in the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the p66 subdomain, respectively.

During minus strand synthesis, the polymerizing RT binds to the 3′ end of the primer and cleaves the RNA template concomitant with DNA synthesis (3Furfine E.S. Reardon J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 406-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative rate of polymerization is 7–10 times faster than RNase H cleavage and the two activities are uncoupled (5Kati W.M. Johnson K.A. Jerva L.F. Anderson K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25988-25997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical studies indicate that the RNase H cuts generate various sized fragments of RNA some of which are left behind still bound to the newly synthesized cDNA during minus strand synthesis (6DeStefano J.J.

For example, an RNA oligonucleotide recessed on a longer DNA segment can represent the products that remain behind after the RT has synthesized a segment of minus strand DNA. On such substrates RT preferentially cleaves ∼18 and 8 nt from the 5′ end of the RNA to produce primary and secondary cleavage products, respectively (8Palaniappan C. Fuentes G.M.

For the RT to make the secondary cut, it must bind ∼10 nt closer to the 5′ end of the RNA relative to positioning for the primary cut. Finally, the RT has also been shown to make internal cleavages not directed by terminus alignment, but occurring with some sequence preference (12Schultz S.J. Zhang M. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 635-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vivo, both RNA 5′ end-directed primary and secondary cleavages and internal cleavages are believed to occur on the RNA fragments that remain annealed to the DNA template following synthesis and cleavage by the polymerizing RT.Similar to the primary/secondary cleavage pattern observed when RT utilizes an RNA 5′ end to direct binding, primary and secondary cleavages have also been observed roughly 18 and 8 nt from the DNA 3′ end, respectively (13Wisniewski M.

DNA 3′ end-directed primary cleavage arises from binding of the DNA primer terminus within the polymerase active site resulting in the positioning of the RNase H active site 18–19 nt upstream.

Secondary cuts of this type likely require movement of the polymerase active site away from the primer terminus to allow repositioning of the RNase H active site ∼8 nt behind the primer terminus. Movement of the polymerase active site away from the primer terminus during synthesis is unanticipated, because DNA polymerases are thought to remain bound to the 3′ terminus of the primer during elongation. The possible roles and effects of DNA 3′ end-directed secondary cleavages have not been explored because these cleavages have only been analyzed and characterized as such in the absence of synthesis.In the crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed to an RNA:DNA hybrid, the highly conserved histidine at position 539 is shown to interact with the scissile phosphate of the RNA (1Sarafianos S.G.

Biol. 1991; 220: 801-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In addition, substitution of the His539 residue with phenylalanine was shown to reduce RNase H activity, however, inhibition of particular types of RNase H cleavage were not characterized (18Schatz O.

Results from these and other studies have shown that mutation of the 539 position has little effect on the polymerase activity of RT, however, the RNase H activity and specificity were altered to varying extents (17Wohrl B.M.

Pause sites are positions where synthesis products accumulate because of a slow rate of synthesis, often as a result of an encounter with a secondary structure, such as a hairpin, on the template (30Suo Z.

The steps in strand transfer with these templates were as follows. During primer extension, RT produced a series of cuts on the first, or donor template, upstream of the hairpin base. This generated an invasion site, a region where the nascent cDNA could interact with the second, or acceptor RNA, to facilitate transfer. Primer extension continued on the donor template and the acceptor:cDNA hybrid propagated toward the primer terminus. At a site downstream of the invasion site, predominantly within the loop region, the primer terminus switched templates from the donor to the acceptor. In this two-step “dock and lock” model for strand transfer an important component of the transfer mechanism is clearing of a region of the donor template (creation of an invasion site) to allow acceptor interaction with the nascent cDNA. In this study we seek to further expand our understanding of strand transfer in this system by determining the characteristics of cleavages that promote efficient creation of an invasion site.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—DNA oligonucleotides were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). NotI, HindIII, and Escherichia coli RNase H were purchased from Invitrogen. Poly(rA)-oligo(dT) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Radionucleotides were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. All other enzymes and dNTP solutions were obtained from Roche Applied Science.Preparation of WT RT and His539 Mutants—Expression plasmids (HXB2 strain) pKK-p66(His6) and pKK-p51(His6) (35Lee R. Kaushik N. Modak M.J. Vinayak R. Pandey V.N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 900-910Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) were kindly obtained as a gift from N. Kaushik. PCR primer-based mutagenesis of pKK-p66(His6) was used to create RT clones with TTT, GAC, and AGA coding for phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and arginine at the 539 position, respectively. The entire RT coding region of WT RT and the three mutant clones were sequenced to verify that the sequence was conserved with the exception of codon 539. RT was purified as previously described (29Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Hanson M.N. Wohrl B.M. Le Grice S.F. Roques B.P. Gorelick R.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol.

The specific activities of the RT preparations were determined by measuring the rate of [α-32P]dTTP incorporation using poly(rA)-oligo(dT) as substrates in a filter binding assay. The specific activities of the RTs were 18,000, 18,000, 21,000, and 24,000 units/mg for WT, H539F, H539D, and H539R RT, respectively. One unit of RT activity is defined as the amount required to incorporate 1 nmol of dTTP into nucleic acid product in a 10-min reaction at 37 °C using poly(rA)-oligo(dT) as template-primer.Generation of RNA Templates—The donor and acceptor constructs pEIAV-Donor and pEIAV-A2 have been previously described (28Roda R.H.

RNA templates were generated by in vitro run-off transcription from linearized plasmids using T7 RNA polymerase as previously described (28Roda R.H. Balakrishnan M. Kim J.K. Roques B.P. Fay P.J.

RNA donor DI was generated from pEIAV-Donor linearized with NotI and RNA AI-2 was generated from pEIAV-A2 linearized with HindIII. Internally labeled donor DI was synthesized by adding [α-32P]CTP to the in vitro transcription reaction. All RNAs were purified by PAGE. To assess the purity of the isolated transcripts, all RNAs were treated with calf alkaline phosphatase, 5′ end radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP, and run on a polyacrylamide gel.Preparation of Substrates—To prepare RNA templates for 5′ end labeling, the 5′ phosphate was removed by calf alkaline phosphatase as per the manufacturer's protocol. RNA and DNA were radiolabeled with polynucleotide kinase as per the manufacturer's protocol using [γ-32P]ATP. Unincorporated ATP was removed by a Bio-Rad P-30 Micro BioSpin size exclusion column. Substrates were prepared by mixing together the RNA and DNA in the appropriate ratio and heating at 95 °C for 5 min followed by slow cooling in a heat block to room temperature. The sequences of the primers used were: dP1, 5′-TACGATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′; dP2, 5′-ACACTATAGAATATGCATCACTAGTAAGCTTCAGGTATGGTCTGC-3′; and dP3, 5′-GGCCGCAGATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATATGCATCAC-3′. Primers ddP2 and ddP3 were the same sequence as dP2 and dP3, respectively, except that the 3′ terminal base was a 2′,3′-dideoxycytidine instead of 2′-deoxycytidine. The 41-mer RNA and 77-mer DNA have been previously described (9Wisniewski M. Balakrishnan M. Palaniappan C. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

DI donor and radiolabeled dP1 primer were mixed in a 1:2 ratio prior to annealing for primer extension experiments. For strand transfer reactions a 1:2:2 ratio of donor:acceptor:primer was used. RT was preincubated with annealed primer and template for 5 min prior to initiation by addition of MgCl2 and dNTPs. The final reaction contained 4 nm primer, 2 nm donor, 4 units of RT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 μm dNTPs, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. Strand transfer reactions additionally contained 4 nm acceptor. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C and were terminated at appropriate time points by the addition of 2× termination dye (20 mm EDTA (pH 8.0), 90% formamide, and 0.1% each of bromphenol blue and xylene cyanol). The products were separated by denaturing PAGE and visualized and quantitated by Storm PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) and ImageQuant software version 1.2 (GE Healthcare). A 10-bp DNA ladder, 5′ end radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase per the manufacturer's protocol, was loaded to serve as a size marker (labeled L in the figures).RNase H Cleavage Assays—Reactions were performed as described above with some minor variations. DNA and radiolabeled RNA were mixed in a 10:1 ratio prior to annealing for donor cleavage experiments. The final reaction contained 2 nm template, 20 nm primer, 4 units of RT, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA. The concentration of dNTPs was 50 μm unless otherwise described. To determine the exact position of the cleavage fragments, reaction samples were run alongside RNase T1 and alkaline hydrolysis ladders generated from the donor template. For polymerase trap experiments, 1 μg of poly(rA)-oligo(dT) per 12.5-μl reaction was added when the reaction was initiated.RESULTSWe reasoned that the ability of RT to generate a series of adjacent cuts at the primary invasion site influences the efficiency of acceptor invasion. Experiments were designed to determine the origin of these cuts and their relevance to the transfer process.Primer Extension and Donor RNA Cleavage by WT HIV-1 RT on EIAV Templates—The hairpin-containing template system used in this study has been previously described (28Roda R.H.

The donor template region from +1 to +78 folds into a stable hairpin as predicted by mfold (37Zuker M.

The acceptor shares a 97-nt region of homology with the donor that begins 19 nt before the hairpin base and extends to the 5′ end of the hairpin. The primer binds to a unique sequence at the 3′ end of the donor RNA. Primer extension by RT was monitored using a 5′ end-labeled DNA primer annealed to the donor template. Extension of the dP1 primer by WT RT resulted in a full-length product (FL) that was 136 nt long and a self-priming product (SP) that was 194 nt long (Fig. 2A). Early in the reaction (1–3 min) the majority of extended primers were stalled at the base of the hairpin (+58/+59). Over time, synthesis proceeded beyond the base of the hairpin and the amount of FL product increased. However, the +58/+59 pause products remained prominent in these reactions. Aside from the major pause site at the hairpin base, pausing of WT RT was also observed at +44, +80, +93, +120, and numerous minor sites.FIGURE 2Primer extension on donor template.

Degradation of the donor template during primer extension was monitored by use of a 5′ end radiolabeled donor template. Fig. 3A illustrates the 5′ terminal donor fragments generated during synthesis by WT RT. By synthesis, we mean the overall primer extension reaction carried out by RT in the presence of primer-template and dNTPs, including primers that are extended, paused, or terminated. In the first minute of the reaction, extension of the primer to about 80 nt was detected. During this time, progressive cleavages on the donor generated products in the range of 120–60 nt (compare Figs. 2A and 3A). In previous studies using this template system we have shown that the 19-nt region of homology between the donor and acceptor RNA, before the hairpin base is important for transfer (28Roda R.H.

Efficient cleavage of the donor within this region creates a site on the cDNA accessible for acceptor interaction. Two prominent cleavages within this region were those at +93 and +83, which corresponds to 15 and 5 nt before the hairpin base, respectively. By 3 min of reaction, the 93-nt product was cleaved and lost, whereas the 83-nt product persisted for the duration of the reaction.FIGURE 3Degradation of donor template during primer extension.

We considered that some of the cuts were the result of DNA 3′ end-directed primary and secondary cleavages made at the pause site, during the course of synthesis. To test this idea, we designed substrates that modeled an extended primer paused at the base of the hairpin and examined the cleavages that were made. The dP2 primer anneals to the template such that its 3′ terminus is base paired to the template 1 nt before the hairpin base (+79 on DI) (Fig. 4). To enable detection of 3′ end-directed cleavages associated with the fixed length primer, the reactions were performed in the absence of dNTPs to prevent primer extension. Addition of WT RT to a"

Importantly, mannose-rich PSMA persists as a trypsin-sensitive protein throughout its entire life cycle, and only Golgi-located PSMA glycoforms acquire trypsin resistance.

The conformational transition of PSMA to a correctly folded molecule is likely to occur in the Golgi and does not implicate ER molecular chaperones, such as BiP. We show here that PSMA is not only heavily N-but also O-glycosylated. The question arising is whether glycans, which do not play a role in folding of PSMA, are implicated in its transport to the cell surface. Neither the cell-surface expression of PSMA nor its efficient apical sorting in polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells are influenced by modulators of N- and O-glycosylation.

Prostate cancer is one of the most common malignancies diagnosed in men and represents a significant worldwide health problem. No conventional treatment is effective following relapse or in case of metastatic disease. In fact, in nearly all of the patients relapsing, cancer progresses despite initial treatment even with the most updated forms of therapy. Biomarkers of prostate cancer have become available recently for the diagnosis, immunotherapy, and predicting of disease progression of prostate cancer (1Landers K.A. Burger M.J.

Paolucci F. Pau B. Poncelet P. Richer G. Vidal H. Voisin G.A. Immunol. Rev. 1982; 62: 185-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Indeed, results obtained in our laboratory demonstrated that PSMA-positive cells are intoxicated by anti-PSMA antibody linked to the ricin toxin A-chain with high efficiency (14Fracasso G. Bellisola G. Cingarlini S. Castelletti D. Prayer-Galetti T. Pagano F. Tridente G. Colombatti M. Prostate. 2002; 53: 9-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Most types of immunotoxins need to be internalized and transported through intracellular compartments before exerting their cytotoxic effect. This requires that a complex series of phenomena take place in an orderly fashion in appropriate locations within the cell. These events in turn are likely to be influenced by the properties and physiology of the relevant target molecules. The enzymatic activity of PSMA and presumably also its folding and antibody recognition may be influenced by a differential glycosylation in tumor or normal cells (15Holmes E.H. Greene T.G. Tino W.T. Boynton A.L. Aldape H.C. Misrock S.L. Murphy G.P. Prostate Suppl. 1996; 7: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The optimization of the overall cytocidal potential of immunotoxins requires therefore elucidation of the properties and physiology of PSMA in cells. In particular, phenomena like rate of translation, maturation during biosynthesis, association with membrane microdomains, cell-surface expression, internalization, and turnover all may have important consequences on the sensitivity of prostate tumor and normal cells to treatment with immunotoxins. Similar to many other type II transmembrane proteins, PSMA is highly glycosylated (16Barinka C. Sacha P. Sklenar J. Man P. Bezouska K. Slusher B.S. Konvalinka J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In particular, PSMA has ten potential N-glycosylation sites. At least nine of them, located in the PSMA ectodomain, are indeed modified by carbohydrates that contribute to the 20-25% of the molecular weight of the native PSMA. As expected, a severe impairment of glycosylation, induced for instance by treatments with tunicamycin, causes the generation of an enzymatically inactive protein that is retained intracellularly (16Barinka C. Sacha P. Sklenar J. Man P. Bezouska K. Slusher B.S. Konvalinka J. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1627-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 17Ghosh A. Heston W.D. Prostate. 2003; 57: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). This is likely to be due to misfolding or inhibition of dimerization, which are crucial for the generation of an active protein (18Schulke N. Varlamova O.A. Donovan G.P. Ma D. Gardner J.P. Morrissey D.M. Arrigale R.R. Zhan C. Chodera A.J. Surowitz K.G. Maddon P.J. Heston W.D. Olson W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12590-12595Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). In the present study we report first on the biosynthesis, processing, and transport of PSMA in transfected COS-1 cells, where PSMA is expressed as a complex glycosylated protein on the cell surface, similar to PSMA molecules found in tumor tissues or serum (15Holmes E.H. Greene T.G. Tino W.T. Boynton A.L. Aldape H.C. Misrock S.L. Murphy G.P. Prostate Suppl. 1996; 7: 25-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The possible role of glycans on the trafficking of PSMA toward the cell surface was investigated by using specific inhibitors of O- and N-glycosylation. A similar experimental approach was also used in polarized MDCK cells to determine whether or not apical sorting signals of PSMA are located in its O- and N-glycans. Furthermore, the folding status of PSMA in the early biosynthetic stages and in particular its association with typical ER-resident chaperones were examined. Materials and Reagents—Tissue culture dishes were obtained from Greiner (Hamburg, Germany). Streptomycin, penicillin, glutamine, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and methionine-free DMEM were purchased from Invitrogen. Fetal calf serum, pepstatin, leupeptin, aprotinin, trypsin inhibitor, molecular mass standards for SDS-PAGE, biotin-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Biotin-NHS), streptavidin horseradish peroxidase, inhibitors of specific N-glycosylation reactions (deoxymannojirimycin, swainsonine, and monensin), and an inhibitor of O-glycosylation, benzyl-N-acetylgalactosamine (benzyl-GalNAc) were purchased from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). Phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antipain, and soybean trypsin inhibitor were purchased from Roche Diagnostics (Mannheim). l-[35S]Methionine (>1000 Ci/mmol) and protein A-Sepharose were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (Freiberg, Germany). Acrylamide, N,N′-methyl-enebisacrylamide, and TEMED were purchased from Carl Roth GmbH (Karlsruhe, Germany). SDS, ammonium persulfate, dithiothreitol, and Triton X-100 (TX-100) were obtained from Merck, (Darmstadt, Germany). Endo-β-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H) and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase F-glycosidase (Endo F) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The anti-PSMA mAb J591, described by H. Liu et al. (12Liu H. Rajasekaran A.K. Moy P. Xia Y. Kim S. Navarro V. Rahmati R. Bander N.H. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4055-4060PubMed Google Scholar), was kindly supplied by Dr. N. H. Bander (Medical College of Cornell University, New York). The murine 7E11c mAb (3Horoszewicz J.S. Kawinski E. Murphy G.P. Anticancer Res. 1987; 7: 927-935PubMed Google Scholar), recognizing the cytosolic tail of PSMA, was purified from the supernatant of the hybridoma HB-10494 (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville Pike, MD) according to standard chromatographic methods. The anti-sucrase-isomaltase antibodies, mGlu1, mGlu2, and mGlu3, were a generous gift of Dr. D. Swallow (The Galton Laboratory, University College London, UK). The anti-BiP and anti-calnexin antibodies were purchased from Stressgen (Victoria, Canada). The anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. The SuperSignal® ELISA Fempto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit was from Pierce, and Kodak BioMax XAR films were from Sigma-Aldrich. Cloning of Human PSMA—A cDNA encoding the human PSMA (hPSMA) was cloned from LNCaP cells using as a template the mRNA purified from LNCaP cells. The following primers were designed based on the nucleotide sequence reported by R. S. Israeli et al. (5Israeli R.S. Powell C.T. Corr J.G. Fair W.R. Heston W.D. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 1807-1811PubMed Google Scholar) and used to obtain two PSMA fragments of 1471 bp and 1426 bp in length, respectively. The primers TGCAGGGCTGATAAGCGAG and AGCCACGCCACGCTCTTG were used to generate a fragment spanning the 5′-region of PSMA that was subcloned into the pBS vector (Invitrogen) in correspondence of a SmaI and a EcoRI restriction enzyme sites. Two other oligonucleotides (the forward primer TCATCCAATTGGATACTATG and the reverse primer TCTTTCTGAGTGACATAC) enabled to amplify a second PCR product that was cloned into the same vector (between EcoRV and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites) and overlapped with the first fragment of PSMA. The complete cDNA sequence of PSMA was finally digested with BamHI and XhoI enzymes and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) to obtain the pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA construct. Transient Transfection of COS-1 Cells, Biosynthetic Labeling, Immunoprecipitation of Total Cellular Extracts, and Western Blotting—COS-1 cells were cultured in 10-cm Petri dishes and in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mm l-glutamine. When the cells reached a confluence of ∼30-40%, they were transiently transfected with 5 μg of pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA. The transfection was carried out according to the DEAE-dextran-based method described previously (19Naim H.Y. Lacey S.W. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12313-12320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in the presence of DNA and DEAD-dextran for 1 h at the standard culturing conditions and then left for further 3 h in the complete DMEM supplemented with 1 μg/ml chloroquine. After washings, the cells were biosynthetically labeled with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine for different time intervals, according to the experimental protocol. In pulse-chase experiments, the cells were pulsed for 30 min and then incubated for further 30 min, 1, 1.5, 2, 4, or 6 h at 37 °C in the presence of fresh medium containing cold methionine. The cells were solubilized on ice for 1 h by using a combination of 0.5% TX-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, dissolved in PBS, supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor). After removal of cell debris by centrifugation and pre-clearing of the total extract with protein A-Sepharose (as described in more detail in Ref. 20Jacob R. Weiner J.R. Stadge S. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10630-10637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the supernatant was immunoprecipitated with a combination of the J591 and 7E11c anti-PSMA mAb. In some experiments immunoprecipitation with each individual antibody, i.e. 7E11c or J591, was performed. Solubilization of cells was also performed under denaturing conditions. Here, the cells were treated for 10 min at room temperature with 0.1% SDS in PBS and the mixture of protease inhibitors. TX-100 was then added to the extracts at a final concentration of 1% to obtain a 10-fold concentration of TX-100 versus SDS. Immunoprecipitation was then carried out using the 7E11c antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were recovered by using 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads and then eluted by boiling in 1% SDS and processed by SDS-PAGE on 7% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were finally detected by exposure of the gel to a Kodak X-Omat AR film and autoradiography (using a PhosphorImager purchased by Bio-Rad). When required, immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to enzymatic digestion with either Endo H or with Endo F according to a method described previously (21Naim H.Y. Sterchi E.E. Lentze M.J. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 427-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the effect of proteases on PSMA immunoprecipitated in its native form was investigated. After washings, the protein A-Sepharose beads binding the immunocomplexes were resuspended in 25 μl of 0.1% TX-100/PBS containing different amounts of either trypsin or chymotrypsin (see “Results”) and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin, used as a carrier. The reaction was prolonged for 30 min at 37 °C and blocked by boiling the samples at 95 °C in the presence of additional 25 μl of Laemmli-containing reducing buffer. The intensity of the protein bands obtained by autoradiography was then quantified by using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Western blot analysis was also performed using total lysates from COS-1 cells that were transfected with pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA. Here, 50 μg cellular proteins were used. The antibody 7E11c was used for antigenic detection. This antibody recognizes denatured forms of both the mannose-rich and complex glycosylated form of PSMA (see “Results”). Co-immunoprecipitation with BiP and Calnexin—To assess the possible interaction of PSMA with BiP or calnexin, total cellular extracts from four plates of transiently transfected COS-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with either anti-BiP or anti-calnexin mAb (22Jacob R. Bulleid N.J. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18678-18684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To study the interaction with BiP, pulse-chase experiments were performed by chasing the cells for 30 min, 1, 2, 4, or 6 h after 30-min labeling with [35S]methionine. After the indicated time intervals, the cells were washed with cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 1% TX-100 and supplemented with a mixture of protease inhibitors (see above) and 10 μg of apyrase (Sigma). When a possible interaction with calnexin was assayed, cells were pulsed for 1 h at 37 °C and chased for 4 h either at 37 °C or at 15 °C. Immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted from protein A-Sepharose by boiling for 5 min at 95 °C in the presence of 1% SDS. Following dilution with 1% TX-100, samples were further processed to detect PSMA with J591 and 7E11c. Protein fractions depleted from BiP or calnexin were separately immunoprecipitated to detect non-interacting PSMA molecules. The possible interaction of PSMA and sucrase-isomaltase with these chaperones was investigated also by Western blotting, after immunoprecipitation of PSMA or sucrase-isomaltase from transiently transfected COS-1 cells. Human sucrase-isomaltase, expressed using the pSG8-hSI-vector (23Ouwendijk J. Moolenaar C.E. Peters W.J. Hollenberg C.P. Ginsel L.A. Fransen J.A. Naim H.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), was immunoprecipitated with a combination of mAbs mGlu1, mGlu2, and mGlu3. Proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE on 7% polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane according to manufacturers' instructions. Anti-BiP and anti-calnexin antibodies were added to the membranes followed by anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. The antigenic detection in a chemiluminescent reaction employed the SuperSignal® ELISA Fempto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit. Cell-surface Immunoprecipitation from COS-1 Cells—COS-1 cells were transfected and labeled following the same procedure described above. Two days post-transfection, cells were labeled for 6 h, and surface-expressed PSMA molecules were immunoprecipitated from intact cells by using the mAb J591. Unbound antibodies were removed by washing the cells three times with cold PBS and were further subtracted by using a cold-lysate of COS-1 cells transfected with PSMA. Cells were lysed for 1 h at 4°C, and the antigen-antibody complexes from the cell surface were recovered with the addition of protein A-Sepharose. Intracellular PSMA was then immunoprecipitated from the supernatant by J591 and 7E11c mAb used in combination. To test the role of inhibitors on the maturation process of membrane proteins, inhibitors of the glycosylation were separately added to the medium during the preincubation of transfected COS-1 cells in methionine-free medium as well as during the labeling with [35S]methionine. Benzyl-GalNAc was used as an inhibitor of the O-glycosylation at 4 mm final concentration, whereas the following inhibitors of the N-glycosylation process were considered: deoxymannojirimycin (dMM), which inhibits the cis-Golgi mannosidase I, and swainsonine and monensin, active in the medial-Golgi and the trans-Golgi, respectively. dMM was used at 5 mm, whereas swainsonine and monensin were given to cells at 4 μg/μl and 1 μm final concentrations, respectively. Detection of Cell-surface Antigens by Biotinylation—COS-1 cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA as described above and incubated 2 h post-transfection with the glycosylation inhibitors dMM (5 mm), swainsonine (4 μg/μl), benzyl-GalNAc (4 mm), or without the inhibitors. The media were changed three times during a period of 48 h, and fresh glycosylation inhibitors were added at the same concentrations. Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS to remove amine-containing culture media and cellular proteins. Biotin-NHS in PBS at 1 μg/ml was added to the cells and left on ice for 30 min. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, quenched with 100 mm glycine, and solubilized as described above. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PSMA antibodies (J591/7E11c) was performed, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis. The chemiluminescent detection of PSMA was carried out using streptavidin horseradish peroxidase and the SuperSignal® ELISA Fempto Maximum Sensitivity Substrate kit. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Subcellular localization of PSMA in transfected COS-1 cells in the presence or absence of glycosylation inhibitors was performed using indirect immunofluorescence. Here, the transfected cells were incubated on coverslips with or without the glycosylation inhibitors dMM, swainsonine, and benzyl-GalNAc using similar procedure as described above. The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.5% saponin to visualize intracellular PSMA. The cell-surface localization was analyzed in non-permeabilized cells. Immunolabeling was carried out using anti-PSMA antibodies (combination of J591 and 7E11c) at 1:100 dilution. The secondary antibody was rabbit anti-mouse conjugated to Alex Fluor 488. The fluorescence images were visualized using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser microscope with a 63× water planapochromat lens (Leica Microsystems). Generation of MDCK Stable Cell Lines Expressing hPSMA and Cell-surface Immunoprecipitation—Stable MDCK cells expressing hPSMA were obtained by using an Eppendorf microinjector (FemtoJet Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Selection of cells containing pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA were positively selected by adding neomycin (500 μg/ml) to the DMEM medium. PSMA expression was finally confirmed by immunoprecipitation (see above). To immunoprecipitate selectively PSMA molecules from the apical or from the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK, cells were cultured to complete confluence on transmembrane filters (24Jacob R. Alfalah M. Grunberg J. Obendorf M. Naim H.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6566-6572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). During the preincubation with methionine-free medium and the 4-h pulse, cells were treated either with 5 mm dMM or with 4 mm benzyl-GalNAc, as inhibitors of the N- and the O-glycosylation, respectively. The J591 anti-PSMA mAb was used to immunoprecipitate PSMA from both the apical and the basolateral surface of MDCK cells, whereas a combination of both J591 and 7E11c mAb precipitated intracellular PSMA molecules. Biosynthesis and Glycosylation of PSMA—COS-1 cells were transiently transfected with a cDNA encoding human PSMA (pcDNA 3.1-hPSMA) and biosynthetically labeled with [35S]methionine for 4 h. After solubilization with a combination of TX-100 and sodium deoxycholate, PSMA was immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates by using a combination of two anti-PSMA mAb, J591 and 7E11c. Preliminary experiments elucidated that mAb J591, directed against a luminal epitope of PSMA, immunoprecipitated both the immature precursor and the complex glycosylated form (of ∼100 and 110 kDa, respectively) with comparable efficiency, whereas 7E11c, recognizing the cytosolic tail, preferentially binds to the immature protein. The immature and the mature forms were discriminated based on their sensitivity to treatment with Endo H (Fig. 1). Endo H digests mannose-rich N-linked glycans, whereas complex carbohydrates are resistant to this enzyme. The substantial shift in the size of the lower 100-kDa band upon Endo H treatment confirmed that this band corresponds to the ER-localized precursor of PSMA. To gather information on the trafficking rate of PSMA between the ER and the Golgi and the kinetics of the glycosylation event, transfected COS-1 cells were labeled with [35S]methionine for 30 min followed by several chase times (Fig. 1). 1 h into the chase, the biosynthetic forms of PSMA comprised a major mannose-rich form and a faint protein band that has acquired a substantial Endo H-resistance indicative of complex glycosylation and maturation. The half-life for the conversion of mannose-rich PSMA to a complex glycosylated species was ∼120 min (Fig. 1B). After 4 and 6 h the proportion of the mature protein progressively increased. The persistence of major proportions of PSMA as a mannose-rich glycosylated polypeptide after 6 h of chase supports the notion that the transport rates of PSMA are very slow. Implication of N- and O-Glycosylation in the Transport and Cell-surface Expression of PSMA—Altered and aberrant glycosylation has been described to occur in essentially all types of experimental and human cancers and many glycosyl-epitopes constitute tumor-associated antigens (25Hakomori S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10231-10233Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). It is still unclear whether altered glycosylation in tumors affects the trafficking and therefore the exposure of tumor-associated antigens at the cell surface. We wanted therefore to investigate the glycosylation pattern of PSMA and its possible implication in the targeting and sorting of the protein. Treatment of PSMA with Endo F, which cleaves both mannose-rich as well as complex glycans, has resulted in a drastic shift in the apparent molecular weight of PSMA concomitant with a high level of N-linked glycosylation of the protein (Fig. 2). The diffuse heterogeneous pattern of the protein band after Endo F treatment is most likely due to the sialylation of Endo F-resistant O-glycans. This type of glycosylation was examined by utilizing the sugar analogue benzyl-GalNAc in biosynthetic labeling experiments of transfected COS-1 cells. Benzyl-GalNAc strongly interferes with the O-glycosylation events by competing with GalNAc (26Kojima N. Handa K. Newman W. Hakomori S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 1288-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and has been frequently used to examine the presence of O-glycan units in glycoproteins (27Alfalah M. Jacob R. Preuss U.

In human tumor mouse xenograft models, radiolabeled HuCC49ΔCH2 was shown to accumulate and be retained to appreciable levels in tumor, exhibit favorable tumor to normal tissue ratios, but demonstrate rapid serum clearance compared with full-length HuCC49 IgG (9Slavin-Chiorini D.C.

Recent clinical studies with low dose 131I-HuCC49ΔCH2 in a small group of patients with meta-static colorectal carcinoma have shown the radioimmunotherapeutic to be well tolerated and to exhibit a demonstrably reduced serum half-life (mean serum half-life of ∼20 h) compared with earlier studies with the 131I-murine CC49 IgG (11Forero A.

HuCC49ΔCH2, by virtue of its rapid serum half-life and presumably reduced risk of eliciting a human anti-murine antibody response, holds promise as being clinically useful for both radioimmunotherapeutic and radioimmunodiagnostic applications (12Agnese D.M.

The variable light and variable heavy domains of HuCC49ΔCH2 are humanized. The light chain constant domain is a human Cκ, and the human γ1 chain has been genetically modified to produce a heavy chain composed of a CH1 domain followed by a partial IgG1 hinge region tethered to the CH3 heavy chain domain by addition of a flexible 10-amino acid GGGSSGGGSG spacer; thus HuCC49ΔCH2 can be described as containing an atypical hinge region. Native human antibody hinge regions can be structurally defined as consisting of an upper hinge region (UH) extending from the last residue of CH1 up to but not including the first inter-heavy chain cysteine, a middle hinge region (MH) extending from the first inter-heavy chain cysteine to a proline residue adjacent to the carboxyl-end of the last MH cysteine, and a highly conserved 7-8-amino acid lower hinge (LH) (14Roux K.H. Strelets L. Brekke O.H. Sandlie I. Michaelsen T.E. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 4083-4090PubMed Google Scholar). The atypical hinge region in HuCC49ΔCH2 is similar to that described in the anti-carcinoembryonic antigen minibody (15Hu S. Shively L. Raubitschek A. Sherman M. Williams L.E. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Wu A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3055-3061PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the MH proline at position 243 (Kabat numbering system (16Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Perry H.M. Gottesman K.S. Foeller C. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. 1991; (5 Ed., pp. -lvii, U. S. Department of Health and Human Services, Washington, D. C.): lviGoogle Scholar)) and the entire CH2 domain, including the LH residues, APELLGGP (the first eight amino-terminal residues of the IgG1 CH2 domain), are deleted and replaced by the 10-amino acid peptide Gly/Ser spacer. Biosynthesis of HuCC49ΔCH2 in mammalian Chinese hamster ovary cells has been observed to produce two homodimeric isoforms present in approximately a 50:50 mixture. 3P. Chinn, personal communication.3P. Chinn, personal communication. The presence of two species has also been shown previously with protein G-purified chimeric B72.3 or chimeric CC49 CH2 domain-deleted antibodies (7Calvo B. Kashmiri S.V. Hutzell P. Hand P.H.

For HuCC49ΔCH2, one isoform, referred to as form A, contains covalent interchain disulfide bonds at heavy chain MH positions 239 and 242, Kabat numbering system. The second isoform, form B, is held together by noncovalent interactions through the CH3 domains, and it fails to develop an interchain hinge disulfide bond as evidenced by the formation of a 60-kDa product following nonreducing, denaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1). The form B isoform is thought to contain heavy chain intrachain disulfide bonds covalently linking the cysteine residue at position 239 to that at position 242. Compound stability studies support form A HuCC49ΔCH2 as the preferred molecule for therapeutic development, and methods for the separation and purification of form A from form B using hydrophobic interaction chromatography have been described (17Brawslasky G. Glaser S. Yang T.-H. Hopp J. Chinn P. U. S. Patent PCT/US2004/020944. 2005; ((July 28, 2005 U. S. Patent PCT/US2004/020944)Google Scholar). However, we projected that development of a cell line that expressed only form A would avoid synthesis of unwanted antibody by-product and, in turn, eliminate the requirement for physical separation of form A from form B, resulting in a more efficient recombinant protein production process. We hypothesized that generation of the two HuCC49ΔCH2 antibody isoforms is a consequence of hinge heterogeneity because of variation in disulfide bond formation. It follows, therefore, that stabilization of the hinge region should favor production of the desired form A isoform. By using a protein engineering strategy, we describe here a series of variant hinge-connecting peptides that were found to improve significantly the homogeneity and yield of CH2 domain-deleted antibodies. Synthetic oligonucleotides (Sigma Genosys) encoding the various hinge region connecting peptides were introduced into the HuCC49ΔCH2 vector using PCR and splicing by overlap extension (SOE) methods. The HuCC49ΔCH2 vector contains a translation-impaired modified (intron-containing) neomycin phosphotransferase gene to select for transcriptionally active integration events and a murine dihydrofolate reductase gene to permit amplification with methotrexate (18Barnett R.S. Limoli K.L. Huynh T.B. Ople E.A. Reff M.E. Wang H.Y. Imanaka T. Antibody Expression and Engineering. 1995: 27-40Google Scholar). Middle and lower hinge mutations were introduced into the parent HuCC49ΔCH2 heavy chain gene by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis (19Kadowaki H. Kadowaki T. Wondisford F.E. Taylor S.I. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 76: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). PCR primer sets were designed with 5′ AgeI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites for cloning the hinge region PCR products into HuCC49ΔCH2 as AgeI/XhoI fragments. PCRs consisted of HuCC49ΔCH2 DNA template, the 5′ primer, MB-04F 5′-CTTCCCCGAACCGGTGACGGTG-3′ and the following 3′ primers: Pro-243 (MB-06R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCGGGGCACGGTGGGCATGTGTG-3′); PAP (MB-010R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCCGGTGCGGGGCACGGTGGGCATGTGTG-3′); C242S + Pro-243 (MB-08R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCGGGGGACGGTGGGCATGTGTG-3′); C242S + PAP (MB-09R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCCGGTGCGGGGGACGGTGGGCATGTGTG-3′); C239S + Pro-243 (MB-11R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCGGGGCACGGTGGGGATGTGTG-3′); and C239S + PAP (MB-012R, 5′-GATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCAGGTGCTGGGCACGGTGGGGATGTGTG-3′). PCRs were initiated with HotStarTaq™ DNA polymerase (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cycle conditions were of 15 min denaturation at 95 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 54 °C, and 1 min of synthesis at 72 °C, followed by a final strand extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Construction of hinge regions containing a cysteine-rich 15-amino acid IgG3 hinge insertion (CPEPKSCDTPPPCPR) in addition to middle and lower hinge mutations were performed using SOE (20Horton R.M. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. 1993; 15 (White, B. A., ed) Vol., pp., Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ: 251-261Crossref Google Scholar). PCR primer sets were also designed with 5′ AgeI and 3′ XhoI restriction sites and consisted of HuCC49ΔCH2 DNA template, the 5′ primer MB-04F, and the following 3′ primers: G1/G3 “SOE overlap” (MB-13R, 5′-GCACCGTGGGCATGGGGGAGGTGTGTCACAAGATTTGGGCTCTGGGCACGGTGGGCATGTG-3′); G1/G3:PAP (MB-14R, 5′-GGATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCAGGTGCTGGGCACCGTGGGCATGGGGGAG-3′); and G1/G3:P243 (MB-15R, 5′-GGATCCGCCTCCACTCGAGCCACCTCCTGGGCACCGTGGGCATGGGGGAG-3′). Briefly, the first PCR contained DNA template, 0.8 μm of the forward primer MB-04F, and a limiting concentration (0.2 μm) of the reverse SOE primer MB-13R. The reaction mixture was denatured for 15 min at 95 °C followed by 20 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 54 °C, and 1 min of synthesis at 72 °C. The second PCR was performed by adding either 0.8 μm MB-14R or MB-15R reverse primer for an additional 20 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 94 °C, 30 s of annealing at 54 °C, 1 min of synthesis at 72 °C followed by 10-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products were purified, digested with restriction endonucleases, and ligated into AgeI/XhoI-digested HuCC49ΔCH2 vector. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for plasmid propagation. Correct modifications to the hinge region were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Plasmid DNA was used to transform CHO DG44 cells for stable production of antibody protein. The CHO cell line, DG44, was grown in CHO-SSFMII medium supplemented with hypoxanthine and thymidine (Invitrogen). Approximately 1 μg of PacI-linearized plasmid DNA was transfected into 4 × 106 CHO cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II electroporation device (Bio-Rad). Conditions for electroporation were 350 V, 600 microfarads, with high capacitance setting. Each electroporation was plated into a 96-well dish (about 400,000 cells/well). Dishes were fed with media containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Geneticin; Invitrogen) beginning 2 days after electroporation and thereafter every 2nd or 3rd day until colonies arose. Supernatants from colonies were assayed for the presence of antibody by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay specific for human antibody. Colonies producing various amounts of antibody were further tested by Western blot analysis to evaluate the secreted isoforms. Briefly, 3 ng of total antibody protein was analyzed by nonreducing 4-20% Tris-glycine SDS-PAGE (Invitrogen) followed by Western blot probed with an anti-human κ antibody (Roche Applied Science), and then an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase antibody (Amersham Biosciences) to detect form A and form B isoforms. Membranes were processed with the ECL Western blotting analysis system according to the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). Colonies producing the highest amount of antibody were expanded, and supernatant dilutions ranging from 30 to 0.23 ng were tested by Western blot analysis as described above. Band intensities corresponding to the A and B isoforms were semi-quantified by imaging the developed film with a CCD camera (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). Band intensities from four lanes that fell within the linear range of the exposed film were measured using the spot densitometry function. The relative ratios of the form A and B isoforms were calculated (mean ± S.E.). Select G418-resistant CHO cell lines producing HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibodies were adapted to CD-CHO media (21Nakamura T. Kloetzer W.S. Brams P. Hariharan K. Chamat S. Cao X. LaBarre M.J. Chinn P.C. Morena R.A. Shestowsky W.S. Li Y.P. Chen A. Reff M.E. Int. J. Immunopharmacol. 2000; 22: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Cell line cultures were scaled up in 25-liter cell bags in a WAVE BIOREACTOR (wave BIOTECH, LLC; Bridgewater, NJ), and supernatants were harvested for affinity purification by protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). In some cases protein G-enriched immunoglobulin isoforms were further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The elution peaks representing form A and form B isoforms were separately pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated, and the amount of protein determined by modified Lowry (Bio-Rad) proteins were analyzed for purity by scanning densitometry (SI 375 personal densitometer; Amersham Biosciences) of reduced and nonreduced SDS-PAGE stained with Coomassie Blue. Size exclusion HPLC was used to analyze the percentage of monomer antibody products. A 96-well assay plate was coated with 8 μg/ml bovine submaxillary mucin, a source of the TAG-72 antigen, and blocked with 1% phosphate-buffered saline:bovine serum albumin. HuCC49ΔCH2, HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP, and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibodies were incubated for 2 h at room temperature starting at 100 μg/ml in 3.5-fold serial dilution with 0.2 μg/ml of Eu3+-labeled HuCC49ΔCH2 tracer, followed by incubation with 200 μl/well DELFIA enhancement solution (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Time-resolved fluorescence was read using the Europium protocol. IC50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (San Diego, CA). Trypsin Digestion of HuCC49ΔCH2 and Hinge Variant Antibodies—Samples of the HuCC49ΔCH2, HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP, and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibodies were denatured, reduced, and digested with trypsin as follows. Aliquots of 150 μg were diluted to 100 μl in HPLC water and denatured in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The samples were reduced by the addition of 20 mm DTT and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The reduced samples were alkylated with 50 mm iodoacetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The alkylation reaction was quenched by the addition of excess DTT. The reduced and alkylated samples were buffer-exchanged into 25 mm Tris, 20 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5, using PD-10 columns. Trypsin was added to each sample in a 1:15 (w/w) ratio and incubated for 4 h at 37°C. The digestion was stopped by the addition of trifluoroacetic acid to a final concentration of 0.1%. Trypsin-digested samples (15 μg) were then analyzed according to the chromatographic procedure described below under “HPLC/Mass Spectrometry Analysis.” Endoproteinase Lys-C Digestion of HuCC49ΔCH2 and Hinge Variant Antibodies (Determination of Disulfide Linkages)—Denatured and reduced samples were prepared by adding a final concentration of 4 m guanidine HCl and 25 mm DTT to 1.5 mg/ml sample. Nonreduced samples were prepared by adding a final concentration of 4 m guanidine HCl to 1.5 mg/ml sample. Samples were incubated for 2 h at 37°C. Digestion buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.0, and 0.062 absorbance units/ml endoproteinase Lys-C) was then added to the samples at 1:1 (v/v), and samples were incubated for 15 h at 37 °C. At 15 h, a second aliquot of enzyme (0.29 milli-absorbance units/μg of antibody) was added, and samples were incubated for an additional 6 h at 37°C. To quench the reaction, trifluoroacetic acid was added at 0.1% final concentration. Nonreduced and reduced endoproteinase Lys-C digested samples (12 μg) were then analyzed according to the procedure described below. HPLC/Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Samples were analyzed on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system connected to an Agilent MSD single quadrupole mass spectrometer. A reverse phase C18 column (Vydac catalog number 218TP52) was used with an eluant system of water, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) (Buffer A) and acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v) (Buffer B), at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min. A post-column “trifluoroacetic acid fixative” solution of acetonitrile and acetic acid (1:1 v/v) at 0.1 ml/min was added to enhance ionization. The column temperature was controlled at 45 °C, and the elution profile was monitored by absorbance at 215 and 280 nm. The total ion chromatogram was monitored in positive ion mode. Samples were injected onto the column, and the gradient was held at 0% Buffer B for 5 min. Elution was accomplished with a linear gradient of 0-50% Buffer B over 125 min, followed by a 75% Buffer B wash over 10 min and a 0% Buffer B re-equilibration over 30 min. Hinge-engineered HuCC49ΔCH2 Antibodies, Expression, and Western Blot Analysis—To examine the effect that hinge region modifications have on the secreted fraction of HuCC49ΔCH2 form A and form B isoforms, a series of genetically engineered HuCC49ΔCH2 hinge variants were constructed and the proteins expressed in CHO cells. TABLE ONE shows the UH and MH amino acid sequences for the parent HuCC49ΔCH2 antibody and the engineered hinge variants. Supernatants from ∼10 individually isolated transfected cell lines representing each hinge variant were collected, and the concentration of antibody in the culture supernatants was determined by immunoassay. Expression levels among the entire set of hinge variants ranged from 300 to 1200 ng/ml with no set of variants showing preferentially high or low expression (data not shown). This would imply that the hinge modifications do not have a major effect on protein expression. 3 ng of total antibody protein from each isolate was analyzed by nonreducing SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with an anti-human κ chain antibody to detect HuCC49ΔCH2 form A and form B isoforms using methods shown in Fig. 1 (data not shown). This preliminary screen showed that differences in the observed ratios of the A:B isoforms among the different engineered antibodies were independent of expression levels and also indicated that the A:B isoform ratios were consistent within the set of approximate 10 clones for each of the hinge-engineered variants. We then performed a more comprehensive Western blot analysis examining a series of supernatant dilutions from representative cell lines for each of the hinge-engineered antibodies (Fig. 2). Under these denaturing conditions, form A antibodies migrate as single 120-kDa disulfide-linked homodimers, and form B antibodies, which fail to form inter-heavy chain disulfide bonds, migrate as two 60-kDa half-molecules. Also visible are disulfide-linked κ dimers and κ chain monomers. A number of lesser intense bands are visible between the A and B antibody isoforms and most likely represent degradation products. The HuCC49ΔCH2 Pro-243 antibody contains an insertion of a single middle hinge proline residue at Kabat position 243, resulting in a modest increase in the form A isoform fraction relative to parent HuCC49ΔCH2 antibody as evidenced by the presence of a 120-kDa band relative to the 60-kDa band at dilute sample concentrations (Fig. 2A). The HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP antibody containing the MH and LH PAP insertion (Kabat positions 243-245) further enhances production of the form A isoform (Fig. 2A). Substituting the cysteine at position 239 with serine in both molecules HuCC49ΔCH2 C239S:Pro-243 and HuCC49ΔCH2 C239S:PAP conversely favored production of the form B isoform (Fig. 2B). Substituting the cysteine at position 242 with serine in HuCC49ΔCH2 C242S:Pro-243 had a marginal effect on the relative quantity of secreted A:B isoforms, yet in contrast it dramatically increased production of the B isoform in HuCC49ΔCH2 C242S:PAP (Fig. 2B). Both antibodies containing the cysteine-rich 15-amino acid IgG3 hinge peptide CPEPKSCDTPPPCPR, HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:Pro-243 and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP, produced predominantly form A isoform with little or no detectable form B (Fig. 2C). In a similar trend as seen with the HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP antibody, the presence of the PAP addition in the HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibody resulted in a greater enhancement of secreted form A isoform compared with HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:Pro-243 containing only the Pro-243 insertion.TABLE ONEParental HuCC49ΔCH2 hinge and variant hinge region amino acid sequences Open table in a new tab Spot densitometry was used to semi-quantify form A and form B band intensities from exposed films shown in Fig. 2 (TABLE TWO). Addition of a single proline residue at position 243 showed modest, albeit statistically insignificant, enhanced production levels of form A relative to the parent HuCC49ΔCH2 molecule (51 ± 7.2% versus 39 ± 7.5%, respectively). Addition of PAP at positions 243-245 increased the fraction of form A to 72 ± 3.1%, whereas the addition of the cysteine-rich 15-amino acid IgG3 hinge peptide sequence plus PAP resulted in up to 98 ± 1.2% secreted form A.TABLE TWOSemi-quantitation of A and B isoforms secreted by CHO cell lines expressing HuCC49ΔCH2 hinge region variant antibodiesConstructFraction form AFraction form B%%HuCC49ΔCH2 (parent)39±7.561±7.5Pro-24351±7.249±7.2PAP72±3.128±3.1C239S:Pro-24323±1.877±1.8C239S:PAP34±0.866±0.8C242S:Pro-24336±2.364±2.3C242S:PAP22±4.578±4.5G1/G3:Pro-24391±1.79±1.7G1/G3:PAP98±1.22±1.2 Open table in a new tab Protein Purification and Characterization—HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibodies were selected for scale-up biosynthesis by mammalian expression in CHO cells. Antibodies from precleared culture supernatants harvested from 10- to 25-liter capacity cell bags were purified by protein G affinity chromatography. HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP form A antibody was efficiently purified using protein G. 41.3 mg of HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP form A antibody was recovered by protein G chromatography from 7.5 liters of supernatant for a yield of 5.5 mg/liter and purity of 98.2% as assessed by scanning densitometry of Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gels. 213 mg of HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP form A:form B mixture was recovered by protein G chromatography with the form A isoform being further purified by hydrophobic interaction chromatography for a final yield of 138 mg from 25 liters or 5.52 mg/liter. Final purity of HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP A isoform was 98.4%. Nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis of purified HuCC49ΔCH2, HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP, and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibodies showed that the protein G affinity chromatography step resulted in form A protein yields consistent with the results seen by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3, lanes 1, 4, and 7). HuCC49ΔCH2 yielded ∼45% form A antibody, HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP yielded 83% form A, and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3: PAP yielded 98.2% form A antibody. Form A HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP antibody elution profiles were analyzed by gel filtration HPLC (Fig. 4). Both antibodies eluted predominantly as single peaks with similar retention times. No aggregates or breakdown products were detected. Competitive Binding Activity—The binding activities of purified HuCC49ΔCH2, HuCC49ΔCH2 PAP, and HuCC49ΔCH2 G1/G3:PAP form A antibodies were compared in a DELFIA time-resolved fluorescence competitive binding assay to bovine submaxillary mucin, a source of the TAG-72 antigen (Fig. 5). In this assay increasing concentrations of unlabeled hinge-engineered antibodies are used to compete with a Eu3+-labeled form A HuCC49ΔCH2 antibody for binding to antigen. The data were analyzed using a one-site competition equilibrium binding model. For both of the hinge-engineered antibodies, HuCC49Δ"
