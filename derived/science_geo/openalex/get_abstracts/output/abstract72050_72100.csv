https://openalex.org/W1556407565,"Thirteen tryptic peptides, which accounted for all of the 102 amino acid residues of calf thymus histone IV, were obtained from the maleylated protein. In addition, eight chymotryptic peptides were isolated from the unmaleylated protein. Six of the chymotryptic peptides were smaller fragments of the other two chymotryptic peptides (37 and 65 residues, respectively). All of the residues of the protein were present in the two large chymotryptic peptides as well as in the six smaller chymotryptic peptides. The sequence studies performed on these peptides, together with the sequence of the COOH-terminal cyanogen bromide peptide previously reported, established the complete amino acid sequence of calf thymus histone IV. Two unusual amino acid residues, e-N-methyllysine (Lys(Me)) and e-N-acetyllysine (Lys(Ac)), were identified and positioned in a cluster of 5 basic residues (Lys(Ac)-Arg-His-Arg-Lys(Me)) starting at residue 16 in the protein. The acetylated lysyl residue was apparently present in only half of the calf thymus histone IV fraction. Other clusters of 2 to 3 basic residues were found throughout the protein with the longest consecutive sequence, lacking a basic residue, being 11 residues (residues 80 to 90). The distribution of residues of various types in histone IV is uneven and suggests a high degree of specificity and a unique conformation. The NH2-terminal portion of the molecule is exceedingly rich in positive charges and the COOH-terminal part contains most of the aromatic, other hydrophobic, threonine residues and negative charges. This distribution suggests that the NH2-terminal part of the histone may involve the major binding sites to DNA whereas the COOH-terminal region appears to be capable of possessing a specific protein conformation."
https://openalex.org/W1543142265,"Abstract The apparent turnovers of mitochondrial DNA and of the phospholipids, cardiolipin, lecithin, and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, have been determined simultaneously in the mitochondria of rat liver, kidney, brain, and heart. The turnover rate of mitochondrial DNA in liver was similar to previously reported turnover rates of other mitochondrial components. Mitochondrial DNA has a half-life of 6.7 days in heart, 9.4 days in liver, 10.4 days in kidney, and about 31 days in brain. The turnover of mitochondrial phospholipids is complex: in the liver and kidney their turnover rates are similar to that of the mitochondrial DNA. In the other organs studied slower and nonexponential turnover rates were found. There was no apparent turnover of nuclear DNA in liver, kidney, or brain during the experiment. A relatively rapid rate of turnover with a half-life of about 30 days was found for heart nuclear DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1552457962,"Abstract The reduced glutathione of normal and glucose-6-P dehydrogenase-deficient human erythrocytes was oxidized by subjecting the cells to H2O2 diffusion or to treatment with methyl phenylazoformate. A portion of the oxidized glutathione thus formed disappeared from the erythrocytes and could be recovered from the medium when the normal cells were incubated in the absence of glucose or when glucose-6-P dehydrogenase-deficient cells were incubated in the absence or the presence of glucose. The movement of GSSG was strictly unidirectional: no GSSG entered the red cell when the normal red cells were incubated in a medium containing a high concentration of added GSSG, so that the ratio of GSSG in the medium to GSSG in the RBC was approximately 600. The rate of GSSG transport from the red cells was found to be approximately linear over a period of 4 hours and could proceed even against a concentration gradient. The transport of GSSG was halted almost entirely by exhausting endogenous high energy compounds such as ATP by preliminary incubation of red cells in a glucose-free medium for 8 hours or by the presence of 0.1 m fluoride in the incubation medium. The rate of GSSG transport from red cells was also found to be markedly temperature-sensitive. Active transport of GSSG from red cells may explain the low levels of total glutathione observed in glucose-6-P dehydrogenase-deficient erythrocytes and the fate of intraerythrocytic glutathione, which has a normal half-life of 2 to 3 days. It may serve as a defense mechanism against inhibition of intracellular enzymes by high levels of GSSG."
https://openalex.org/W1971926900,"Administration of pure 1-Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol to mice had the following dose-dependent neurochemical and behavioral effects: a slight but significant increase in concentrations of 5-hydroxytryptamine in whole brain; a decrease in concentration of norepinephrine in brain after administration of low doses and an increase after high doses; diminished spontaneous activity, moderate hypothermia, hypersensitivity to tactile and auditory stimuli, and ataxia after low doses; and sedation, pronounced hypothermia, and markedly diminished spontaneous activity and reactivity after high doses. The duration of the effects on body temperature and spontaneous activity correlated generally with the changes in brain amines. The characteristic changes in brain amines do not correspond exactly to those observed with other psychotropic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W1516201991,"Abstract The mechanism of hyaluronic acid chain growth in a particulate enzyme preparation obtained from Group A Streptococcus has been examined and additional characteristics of the enzyme detailed. Hyaluronic acid chain elongation occurs by the transfer of monosaccharide units from uridine nucleoside diphosphate derivatives to the nonreducing ends of endogenous oligosaccharide. This oligosaccharide which appeared to be chemically identical with hyaluronic acid was released from the enzyme by either acid hydrolysis or digestion with streptococcal hyaluronidase. The only detectable uridine nucleotide product of hyaluronic acid synthesis was UDP, and synthesis was not inhibited by bacitracin. There was no evidence for the participation of lipid-extractable intermediates during hyaluronic acid formation. The pH optimum for polysaccharide formation is 7.1. The enzyme exhibits an absolute dependence upon divalent metal ion and is maximally activated by 10 mm Mg++ or 1 mm Mn++. Michaelis constants for UDP-GlcUA and UDP-GlcNAc are 5 x 10-5 m and 5 x 10-4 m, respectively. The enzyme is inactivated by treatment with 4% 1-butanol. Addition of Mg++ and UDP, UDP-GlcUA, UDP-GlcNAc, or other uridine nucleoside diphosphate sugars prior to butanol treatment prevented inactivation. Fifty per cent stabilization of the enzyme during butanol treatment occurred at 7 x 10-5 m UDP."
https://openalex.org/W1558998530,"Abstract The reversible and irreversible inactivation of pig muscle glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (d-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase (phosphorylating), EC 1.2.1.12) with tetrathionate, o-iodosobenzoate, and iodine monochloride has been studied. This investigation has revealed that tetrathionate reacts stoichiometrically with the catalytically active sulfhydryl group of the enzyme to form a sulfenyl thiosulfate derivative under reversible conditions. The sulfenyl thiosulfate derivative of the enzyme is stable at 0°, but decomposes at higher temperatures. During this decomposition the enzyme is irreversibly inactivated. The experimental evidence presented strongly indicates that the catalytically active sulfhydryl group is converted to a stabilized sulfenic acid during its stoichiometric reaction with o-iodosobenzoate at 0°. The reaction of iodine monochloride is complex. However, at 0° it reacts with the catalytically active sulfhydryl group of the enzyme. The product of this reaction is in part a sulfenyl iodide derivative and in part what again appears to be a sulfenic acid derivative of this essential sulfhydryl group. At 26° iodine monochloride irreversibly inactivates the enzyme. During this irreversible inactivation, iodine is not substituted into tyrosine or histidine."
https://openalex.org/W1968588058,"Lactose synthesis in the mammary gland is dependent on the hormonally controlled synthesis of the two protein components of lactose synthetase, α-lactalbumin and a galactosyltransferase. Prolactin induces the synthesis of both proteins in mammary gland explants treated with insulin and hydrocortisone, but the induction kinetics cannot account for the asynchronous synthesis of the two proteins that are observed in vivo. Progesterone appears to take part in the control of lactose synthesis and acts to repress the formation of α-lactalbumin throughout pregnancy. At parturition, when the concentration of progesterone in the plasma decreases, the rate of α-lactalbumin synthesis increases."
https://openalex.org/W1554968189,"Specific activities of phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase and diglyceride acyltransferase, which catalyze the biosynthesis of 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol, respectively, from the common substrate 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol, were measured in liver microsomal preparations from alloxan-diabetic rats and from rats treated with triiodothyronine and propylthiouracil. Diglyceride acyltransferase was induced in both the ketotic diabetic and the triiodothyronine-treated animals but was repressed in the propylthiouracil-treated group. Phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase specific activity was unchanged by propylthiouracil treatment. In the ketotic diabetic and triiodothyronine-treated animals the magnitude of changes in phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase activity differed from that of diglyceride acyltransferase. The direction and magnitude of changes in the specific activity of these enzymes are compatible with their acting as regulators of 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol synthesis at the 1,2-diacyl-snglycerol branch point in the complex lipid biosynthetic pathway. The data are compatible with a possible association between the regulation of synthesis de novo of 3-sn-phosphatidylcholine and the assembly and release of lipoproteins from the liver. Methods for the chemical synthesis of phosphorylcholine and palmityl coenzyme A are described which are suitable for preparation of radioactively labeled substrates."
https://openalex.org/W1577628093,"Abstract With the use of purified chondroitinase of Proteus vulgaris, a method has been devised for the determination of relative amounts of chondroitin, chondroitin-4-SO4, and chondroitin-6-SO4 in cartilage. This method was applied to the analysis of embryonic chick epiphyseal cartilage. With 35SO4 and 14C-acetate it was possible to study the relationship of embryo age to rate of formation of chondroitin, chondroitin-4-SO4, and chondroitin-6-SO4. Between 10 and 19 days there is a progressive decrease in synthesis of chondroitin and chondroitin-4-SO4 and a progressive increase in synthesis of chondroitin-6-SO4."
https://openalex.org/W1551134780,"Abstract Interactions of specific and nonspecific agents at the dihydroxyacetone-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P sites of rabbit muscle aldolase are shown by several methods: quenching of protein fluorescence, protection against the destructive action of trypsin, the inhibition of initial rates and of equilibrium exchange rates, and the inactivation caused by NaBH4. It is concluded from inactivation and labeling studies that glycolaldehyde-P can form a Schiff's base at the dihydroxyacetone-P site. d-Glyceraldehyde-3-P and erythrose-4-P, like dihydroxyacetone-P, cause fluorescence quenching at low concentration, whereas l-glyceraldehyde-3-P, which is a good acceptor for dihydroxyacetone-P, does not. The competitive inhibition shown by small anions such as Cl-, Pi, and ethyl-P is first order for these anions with fructose-1-P as the substrate but approximately second order with fructose-1,6-di-P as substrate. This suggests that binding of fructose-1-P to the enzyme is prevented by an anion bound to the dihydroxyacetone-P site, but not by one at the aldehyde-P site, whereas fructose-di-P binding is prevented by anion interaction with either site. Acetol-P ([see PDF for equation]) is a substrate for the proton exchange reaction of aldolase. It has a much higher Km than dihydroxyacetone-P, the maximum velocity of exchange is about 17% as great, and its rate of condensation with glyceraldehyde-3-P only about 1% that found with dihydroxyacetone-P. l-Glyceraldehyde-3-P is a competitive inhibitor of the proton exchange reaction of acetol-P but does not react with the dihydroxyacetone-P site as shown by lack of fluorescence quenching. This suggests that, although the enzyme can bind aldehyde, the complex is inappropriate for productive reaction with dihydroxyacetone-P. This is consistent with earlier studies requiring that the condensation is an ordered reaction with dihydroxyacetone-P reacting before aldehyde. The inactivation of aldolase as a result of reaction with l-glyceraldehyde-3-P is like that produced by carboxypeptidase in that it seems to inhibit the rate of —C—H bond cleavage and not —C—C bond cleavage of fructose-di-P. This is concluded since that transaldolase action of the treated enzyme with acetaldehyde as an acceptor is not much slower than that of untreated enzyme. The rate of inactivation with l-glyceraldehyde-3-P shows saturation kinetics with a Kinactivation that agrees with its Ki as a competitive inhibitor of fructose-1-P cleavage. However, in view of the finding that the transaldolase activity of the treated enzyme is unimpaired, the locus of this l-glyceraldehyde-3-P action cannot be that of the fructose-di-P binding. Those compounds that quench protein fluorescence also protect aldolase from inactivation by trypsin, whereas aldehydes such as dl-glyceraldehyde and l-glyceraldehyde-3-P form complexes that are more susceptible to trypsin action. Carboxypeptidase treatment of aldolase is observed to produce a large decrease in Km of fructose-di-P. This is contrary to the findings of others, but is required by theory if the ordered reaction mechanism is correct and if the effect of carboxypeptidase action is restricted to the step for protonation of the enzyme-dihydroxyacetone-P eneamine, as is believed."
https://openalex.org/W1486117268,"Abstract The effects of vitamin D on transport of inorganic phosphate into and across rat intestinal mucosa in vitro were studied, and the results used to interpret observations on incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphate into mucosal lipid, protein, and nucleic acids. Vitamin D given to intact rats increases phosphate transport in vitro selectively in the direction mucosa to serosa. The sterol in vivo acts directly in the intestine with no prior activation in other organs. 32Pi transport is via restricted channels in the mucosa, as indicated by the observation that the specific radioactivity of transported 32P-labeled phosphate is miscible with approximately one-third or less of the mucosal Pi pool. Because of this compartmentalization specific radioactivities of individual mucosal precursor pools of 32Pi are difficult or impossible to estimate. Consequently, effects of vitamin D on incorporation of 32P-labeled phosphate into mucosal constituents cannot be interpreted definitively in terms of rates of synthesis. The relative effects of vitamin D on calcium as compared to phosphate transport in various segments of intestine, and other evidence, suggests that the sterol influences separately these two intestinal transport mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1491603175,"Abstract Spinach leaf ribulose 1,5-diphosphate carboxylase is reversibly inhibited by cyanide at low concentration; 10-5 m and 10-4 m cyanide inhibit the carboxylation reaction 51% and 91%, respectively. Inhibition by cyanide (Ki = 1.6 x 10-5 m) is uncompetitive (anticompetitive) with respect to ribulose 1,5-diphosphate (ribulose-1,5-di-P) and is of mixed character with respect to Mg2+ and HCO3-. This and other kinetic evidence suggest that cyanide combines readily with enzyme-ribulose-1,5-di-P complex, but not with enzyme. The inference that enzyme-ribulose-1,5-di-P complex reacts with cyanide to form an inactive ternary complex is supported by binding studies with the use of the gel filtration technique. Ribulose-1,5-di-P uniformly labeled with 14C is tightly bound to the carboxylase (1.04 moles of ribulose-1,5-di-P per mole of enzyme) only in the presence of cyanide and 14C-cyanide is bound to the carboxylase (1.06 moles of cyanide per mole of enzyme) only in the presence of ribulose-1,5-di-P. The presence of Mg2+ is without effect on 14C-ribulose-1,5-di-P binding in the presence of cyanide or on 14C-cyanide binding in the presence of ribulose-1,5-di-P under the conditions used. A ternary complex of ribulose-1,5-di-P carboxylase, ribulose-1,5-di-P, and cyanide in a mole ratio of 1:1:1 is indicated. Attempts to demonstrate Schiff base formation between the carboxylase and ribulose-1,5-di-P under a wide variety of conditions were unsuccessful."
https://openalex.org/W1512474368,"Abstract Low concentrations of calcium (l100µm) cause a marked inhibition of 14C-carbon dioxide production from carboxyl-labeled pyruvate by isolated rat liver mitochondria. This effect disappears in the presence of agents which preclude pyruvate carboxylase activity such as dinitrophenol plus oligomycin. Adding ATP in combination with these agents restores carboxylase activity and the inhibitory effect of calcium returns. If malate is added, the system again becomes less dependent on pyruvate carboxylase activity and calcium loses its effectiveness. Malate can also overcome inhibition caused by dinitrophenol. Pyruvate carboxylase activity can be monitored more directly by measuring the net accumulation of Krebs cycle intermediates formed from pyruvate or incorporation of pyruvate-carboxyl-14C to the cycle intermediates. Calcium (100µm) inhibited both of these processes by as much as 75%. Studies with partially purified carboxylase confirm the concept that calcium is an effective inhibitor, and indicate that the effect may be due to competition with magnesium ion. Mitochondria from vitamin D-deficient or cortisone-treated animals exhibited higher carboxylase activities than those of control animals as measured by the indirect 14CO2 assay method. These changes are consistent with the known effects of those agents on calcium metabolism in vivo. Results are discussed in terms of the possibility that calcium may play an important role in regulating the initial steps of gluconeogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1593811929,"Abstract A model amino acid, 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid, highly specific to the Na+-independent transport agency for neutral amino acids with large apolar side chains, has been shown to be excreted slowly by the intact rat, to be metabolized to a very small extent if at all, and to be accumulated by tissues, especially by pancreas. One of the two isomeric forms of this substance was retained in the rat longer than the other, although both were taken up by tissues, and both presumably were resorbed from the glomerular filtrate. When 5 to 10 mmoles per kg of body weight were injected intraperitoneally, the urinary excretion of several ordinary amino acids was increased. In addition, the plasma levels of several amino acids were decreased, although that of phenylalanine may have increased. These effects appeared to be at least as severe in adrenalectomized rats, which were easily prostrated by 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid administration. The injections were found to lower the blood glucose, the effect being especially strong in animals first treated with tolbutamide. The effect was more prolonged than that of leucine. This behavior leads us to propose that the stimulation of insulin secretion may be triggered by binding at strategically situated transport receptor sites. The uptake of 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid by the isolated, intact rat diaphragm was, however, not stimulated by insulin."
https://openalex.org/W1588233911,"Abstract The phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactor from Pseudomonas species (ATCC 11299a) has been purified. The techniques used included dialysis, Florisil chromatography, carboxymethyl Sephadex chromatography, and paper chromatography with butyl alcohol-acetic acid-H2O as solvent. After oxidation of the purified material, several pteridines were isolated. The major component was shown to be 2-amino-4-hydroxy - 6 -(l - threotrihydroxypropyl) pteridine, l - threoneopterin. Also present were 6-carboxypterin, pterin, and xanthopterin. Some evidence was also obtained for the presence of erythroneopterin and a cyclic phosphate of neopterin. The observations suggest that the phenylalanine hydroxylase cofactor from Pseudomonas is reduced l-threoneopterin."
https://openalex.org/W1517857166,"Abstract Derivatives of staphylococcal nuclease containing monoaminotyrosyl residues in position 85 or 115 were treated at pH 5 with two bifunctional reagents, p,p'-difluoro-m,m'-dinitrodiphenylsulfone (F2DPS) and 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (F2DNB). Monofunctional reaction occurred exclusively at the aminotyrosyl residue, and there was no significant hydrolysis of the second fluorine atom. The excess bifunctional reagent was then removed by gel filtration, and the pH was raised to 9.4 to allow reaction of the other end of the reagent molecule. This final cross-linking procedure could be followed spectrophotometrically. The peptides containing the cross-links were purified from tryptic digests of each of the cross-linked proteins. The positions of the cross-linked peptides in the primary sequence of nuclease were determined. The aminotyrosyl residue at position 85 cross-links to tyrosine 115 with F2DPS and to lysine 116 with F2DNB, whereas aminotyrosine 115 is probably bridged by F2DPS to lysine 53 and by F2DNB to lysine 136. The results confirm the stereochemical proximity of the tyrosine residues at positions 85 and 115. This had been predicted from catalytic and physicochemical properties of the corresponding nitrotyrosine derivatives, which suggested a functional cooperatively between these two tyrosine residues. Unique intramolecular cross-links did not form when the native enzyme was treated with bifunctional reagents at pH 8 to 10. This was presumably due to the facile reaction of many amino groups with these reagents."
https://openalex.org/W1510519637,"Abstract The circular dichroism of human hemoglobin and its isolated chains has been measured in the 210 to 460 mµ region. In the Soret region, human hemoglobin exhibits a complex circular dichroism with a large positive extremum and a small negative trough. Although α and β chains are much alike in tertiary structure, α chains exhibit a single positive band and β chains give a complex circular dichroism with a positive and a negative band in the Soret region. The circular dichroism spectra of reconstituted hemoglobin, which are essentially identical with those of native hemoglobin, are not simply the sum of the circular dichroism spectra of the isolated subunits. The positive ellipticity of deoxygenated hemoglobin is about twice as great as the value calculated from those of the isolated chains. Horse heart myoglobin exhibits a single positive band similar to that of α chains."
https://openalex.org/W1593645090,"Abstract Purified bovine growth hormone, consisting of a single polypeptide chain, has been found to contain NH2-terminal alanine, phenylalanine, and methionine in nearly equal amounts. The minimum molecular weight calculated from its amino acid composition is 20,846. Five unique fragments have been prepared from bovine growth hormone by cleavage at 4 methionyl residues with cyanogen bromide. In the order of their elution from Sephadex G-50 and G-75, these have been designated Fragment A, with 109 amino acids; Fragment B, 31 amino acids; Fragment C, 25 amino acids; Fragment D, 12 amino acids; and Fragment E, a pentapeptide. Partial characterization of these fragments indicates a high degree of similarity between this molecule and human growth hormone. Isolation of tryptic peptides derived from Fragment C lends additional support to the apparent homology."
https://openalex.org/W1597683725,"Abstract 1. Oleate, 2,4-dinitrophenol, and other uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation have been compared with respect to their ability to stimulate the production of phosphoenolpyruvate from citric acid cycle intermediates and to alter the pathways of oxidation of pyruvate, glutamate, glutamine, and proline by rabbit liver mitochondria. 2. Oleate or 2,4-dinitrophenol stimulated the production of phosphoenolpyruvate from citrate or α-ketoglutarate even at concentrations of uncouplers which completely block respiratory chain-linked oxidative phosphorylation. 3. With malate or oxalacetate as substrate, uncouplers stimulated respiration and formation of phosphoenolpyruvate. In the presence of arsenite, production of phosphoenolpyruvate was blocked and pyruvate accumulated from these substrates. Added ATP restored phosphoenolpyruvate formation. 4. With pyruvate as substrate, low levels of uncouplers stimulated respiration, formation of citric acid cycle intermediates, and phosphoenolpyruvate. As the concentrations of uncouplers were increased, net formation of citrate, malate, and phosphoenolpyruvate was abolished, and pyruvate was diverted to acetoacetate. The level of added inorganic phosphate markedly influenced the rate of carboxylation of pyruvate. 5. With glutamate, glutamine, or proline as substrate, relatively low levels of oleate or 2,4-dinitrophenol gave optimal stimulation of respiration. However, at higher concentrations of uncouplers, formation of phosphoenolpyruvate was further increased without alteration of the respiratory rate. These effects may be explained by alterations in the relative rates of glutamic dehydrogenase and glutamicoxalacetic transaminase, the oxidation-reduction state of NAD(P), and the steady state level of oxalacetate. 6. The accumulated evidence supports the view that increased hepatic free fatty acids may facilitate gluconeogenesis in rabbit liver by uncoupling mitochondrial respiration."
https://openalex.org/W1805097703,"Abstract l-Glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD oxidoreductase (EC 1.1.1.8) from rabbit skeletal muscle obtained commercially in several separate lots was purified and examined for absence of contaminating proteins. Amino acid analysis showed 3 tyrosine, 2 tryptophan, 7 arginine, 7 histidine, 9 cysteine or half-cystine, and 22 lysine residues per minimal molecular weight which was 30,133. Peptide mapping of trypsin and of trypsin-chymotrypsin digests of the 14C-S-carboxymethylated enzyme under a variety of conditions showed 3 tyrosine, 2 tryptophan, 7 arginine, 5 or 6 histidine, 9 or 10 14C-S-carboxymethylcysteine, and 28 to 31 tryptic peptides. Molecular weight estimation on Sephadex G-75, G-100, and G-200 gave values ranging from 61,000 to 66,000. An s20,w of 4.2 was obtained by sedimentation velocity and by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Equilibrium ultracentrifugation by the LaBar method gave a molecular weight of 66,000 to 69,000. These chemical studies in conjunction with the physical determinations show that the enzyme has a molecular weight of 60,266 (excluding the nonprotein component) and is composed of subunits that are indistinguishable by peptide mapping. Thus, the substantial difference in molecular weight that was previously indicated between the enzyme from rabbit muscle as compared to that from rat or bee muscle does not exist. The possibility that l-glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase may be related in primary structure is suggested based on substrate specificity, molecular weight, and difference index between their propsective amino acid compositions, but definitive evidence is not yet available."

Radioactivity was incorporated into a band of mitochondrial DNA which had a higher buoyant density than previously existing unlabeled DNA. The difference in density between labeled and unlabeled mitochondrial DNA bands doubled if the DNA was denatured after the introduction of strand breakages to allow complete separation of complementary strands. The result suggests that replication of mitochondrial DNA is by a semiconservative mechanism and that there is little, if any, repair of the DNA. Similar results leading to the same conclusions were obtained for nuclear DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1642691213,"Abstract RNA made in vitro on a DNA (from T2, T3, T4, or T7 phage) template was subjected to a limited digestion with ribonuclease T1 and fractionated according to chain length. The oligonucleotides of various chain lengths were annealed at various temperatures to denatured DNAs immobilized on membrane filters. In the absence of Mg++, a chain length of 10 or more ribonucleotides is required to form a ribonuclease-resistant complex with denatured DNA. In the presence of Mg++, oligonucleotides as small as octanucleotides can form a detectable complex with denatured DNA. The shortest oligonucleotides capable of forming a complex with denatured DNA do so with a high degree of specificity for species; oligonucleotides produced from T-even phage DNAs will form a complex only with T-even DNAs, not with T-odd DNAs, and vice versa. The expression of heterology between the T-even and T-odd phage DNAs seems to occur on passing from a chain length of 9 to 10. As expected, the temperatures for optimum complex formation and the melting temperatures of the oligoribonucleotide-denatured DNA complexes increase with the chain length of the oligonucleotides. When chain length is constant, these temperatures are considerably higher for the oligonucleotides produced from T-odd phage DNAs than for those produced from T-even ones, suggesting that the former oligonucleotides, having higher guanine + cytosine contents, form complexes that are considerably more stable than those formed by the latter."
https://openalex.org/W1556325488,"Abstract An enzyme was found in the muscle layers of Ascaris lumbricoides which was similar to the protocollagen proline hydroxylase found in chick embryos and other vertebrates in that it synthesized 14C-hydroxyproline when incubated with 14C-proline-labeled protocollagen from chick cartilage. The Ascaris enzyme was also similar in that it required atmospheric oxygen, α-ketoglutarate, iron, and ascorbate in order to synthesize 14C-hydroxyproline. A further similarity between the Ascaris hydroxylase and the one in chick embryos was that preparations of proline-labeled protocollagen from the cuticle of Ascaris served as substrates only after they were boiled. The Ascaris hydroxylase differed from the chick embryo enzyme in that it was partially inhibited by incubation in normal atmospheric air, and the rate of the reaction increased by about 50% as the oxygen content of the gas phase was reduced to 1%. The Km for α-ketoglutarate for the Ascaris enzyme was about 4 x 10-4 m, or about 100-fold greater than the Km for α-ketoglutarate with the chick embryo enzyme. A further difference was that the Ascaris enzyme was not inhibited by poly-l-proline form II which competitively inhibits the chick embryo enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1573329752,"Abstract An enzyme which catalyzes a reversible transamination between d-β-aminoisobutyrate and pyruvate was found in the liver of rat, guinea pig, and hog, and the enzyme in an extract of hog liver acetone powder was purified about 200-fold. The enzyme was localized almost exclusively in the liver among the tissues examined in the guinea pig. It was most active against d-β-aminoisobutyrate among the ω-amino acids examined, and had little effect on the l isomer; this specificity is markedly different from that of β-aminoisobutyrate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, for which the d isomer is not a substrate. Since the β-aminoisobutyrate in human urine and liver has the d configuration and a genetically determined high excretor cannot destroy the amino acid, it was postulated that the enzyme activity might be absent from the liver of genetic high excretors of β-aminoisobutyrate. The activity of the enzyme in liver and the concentration of β-aminoisobutyrate in urine were measured in material obtained at autopsy of 15 bodies. The enzyme activity was always found in the liver specimens from eight low excretors and not found in five of seven high excretors. Thus the genetically determined high excretion of β-aminoisobutyrate occurs most probably because of the absence of the aminotransferase from the liver of excretors."

The visible absorption spectra of the reaction mixtures were resolved to show that identical species of the peptide complexes gave identical wave lengths of maximum absorbance with some variation in the molar extinction values. 3. Cotton effects were observed in the visible range for peptide complexes containing optically active amino acid residues. In each case the circular dichroism spectrum showed a single negative band or perhaps closely overlapping negative bands. The general form of the spectra was similar to that observed with tripeptide complexes containing l-alanyl residues, and indications of an additivity effect in substitutions in the chelate rings are presented. In all cases optically active transitions were observed near 300 mµ. 4. The contribution of the NH2-terminal l-alanyl moiety in complexes of peptides containing 2,3, or 4 more subsequent glycyl residues was constant as to optical rotatory power, in the visible range, although the tripeptide complex differed in wave length of the extremum from the tetra- and pentapeptide complexes. 5. The optical rotatory properties of the fully formed complex with l-valyl-l-leucyl-l-seryl-l-glutamylglycine, corresponding to the NH2-terminal sequence in sperm whale myoglobin, can be distinguished qualitatively from that of complexes with histidine-containing peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1939089109,"Abstract After intravenous injection of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-3H (homocysteine-labeled) into rats, less than 15% of the radioisotope was incorporated into protein methionine or excreted in the urine as α-ketobutyrate. The remaining radioisotope was found associated with an unknown keto acid excreted in the urine. Intravenous injection of S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine-35S or S-adenosyl-3H-l-homocysteine (adenosine-labeled) revealed that both the sulfur atom and purine moiety remained associated with this compound. These findings suggest that S-adenosylhomocysteine undergoes direct deamination. This compound was isolated by ion exchange chromatography and precipitated with phosphotungstic acid. After decomposition of the phosphotungstate complex with organic solvents, crystallization was effected from aqueous ethanol. This compound has an absorption maximum at 262 mµ, em = 12,300, is ninhydrin-negative, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine-positive, reduces platinic iodide, and reacts with orcinol. Further analytical data including elemental analysis and infrared spectral analysis indicate the chemical structure of this compound to be S-adenosyl-γ-thio-α-ketobutyrate."

After preliminary fractionation by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 columns, 0.9 × 400 cm, they were purified by column chromatography on Dowex 50-X2, Dowex 1-X2, and Sephadex G-25. The amino acid sequence of each peptide was determined by subtractive Edman degradation and specific enzymatic hydrolysis. The peptides, isolated in 38 to 94% yield, account for 55 of 56 amino acid residues in the parent single chain polypeptide."
https://openalex.org/W1599709682,"Abstract Rat epididymal fat pad segments were incubated with glucose labeled uniformly with 14C, and with tritium in position 2, and in positions 1,3, and 6. Under conditions of high lipogenesis, 70 to 80% of tritium (T) from position 2 was recovered in water, with the remainder in lipid glycerol, fatty acids, and lactate. The highest tritium retention, relative to carbon, was in glycerol, with T:14C ratios from glucose uniformly labeled with 14C and with tritium in position 2 in the presence of insulin of 0.6 to 0.8. Of this tritium, 12 to 15% was on C-1 of glycerol. In the presence of epinephrine, when the pentose cycle was low, retention of tritium in position 2 was decreased. Retention and distribution of tritium from position 2 of glucose in hexose 6-phosphates is a function of four factors: (a) the rate of hexose 6-phosphate isomerase reaction; (b) the ratio of exchange to transfer of hydrogen in this reaction; (c) isotope discrimination against tritium in the isomerization; and (d) the contribution of the pentose cycle to glucose metabolism. Attempts to evaluate some of these parameters in adipose tissue are presented. It was estimated that about half of the hydrogen from position 2 of glucose 6-phosphate was exchanged with protons via the phosphohexose isomerase reaction. The observed high retention of tritium reflects the high level of pentose cycle in this tissue, isotope discrimination effects, and relatively slow rate of hexose 6-phosphate isomerase."
https://openalex.org/W1504269959,"Abstract The fluorescence emission spectrum of papain is attributable to the tryptophan residues in this protein with little contribution from tyrosine residues. The pH dependence of the fluorescence intensity of unactivated papain follows closely the titration curve for a residue of apparent pK' of 6.6 at 25°, while that of active papain can be fitted by a curve obtained by the summation of the titration curves for groups of apparent pK' of 6.6 and 8.5 at 25°. Examination of the temperature dependence of the pH fluorescence profiles, as well as a study of several inactive papain derivatives in which the thiol group at the active site has been alkylated, indicates that the above pK' values can be ascribed to the side chain of a histidine residue and to the thiol group at the active site of the enzyme, respectively. The fluorescence of both active and unactivated papain is unchanged in the presence of ethylene glycol (40%, v/v), methanol (50%, v/v), or dioxane (20%, v/v). The circular dichroism spectra, as well as ultraviolet difference spectra produced by solvent perturbation, of active and unactivated papain were superimposable, indicating that activation of this enzyme is associated with little, if any, conformational change."
https://openalex.org/W1486336224,"Abstract Guinea pig liver transglutaminase is rapidly and progressively inactivated during incubation with copper salts in the presence of calcium, a divalent cation essential for enzymatic activity. Substrate exerts some protection against this inactivation. Complete loss of transglutaminase activity is accompanied by a concomitant loss of approximately 4 sulfhydryl residues. This loss of enzyme sulfhydryl groups appears to be the result of formation of 2 intramolecular disulfide bridges. The Cu++-inactivated enzyme is readily reactivated by treatment with dithiothreitol or potassium cyanide. Peptide mapping experiments show that a sulfhydryl group of transglutaminase previously identified as essential for catalytic activity is not a component of the disulfide bonds formed as a result of Cu++ treatment. The dissociation constant (Kd) for calcium (7.1 ± 1.0 x 10-3 m) estimated from the rate of inactivation of transglutaminase by Cu++ as a function of calcium ion concentration is in close agreement with Kd values for calcium determined by other direct binding experiments. It is suggested, on the basis of earlier findings, that a calcium-induced conformational change in the enzyme protein is essential for Cu++-catalyzed formation of an inactive disulfide form of transglutaminase."
https://openalex.org/W1531577368,"Abstract Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase has been partially purified from bovine liver and some of its kinetic properties studied. This enzyme is easily separable from niacin ribonucleotidase. ATP is not a required substrate for bovine liver nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase, as has been reported, but activates the enzyme by lowering the apparent Michaelis constants for both nicotinate and ribosylpyrophosphate 5-phosphate by approximately 10-fold. The stimulation by ATP appears to be highly specific. The kinetics of ATP activation indicate that ATP is binding at only one site on the enzyme. When ATP is present in the reaction, it is cleaved to form ADP in an amount approximately stoichiometric with nicotinic acid mononucleotide formation. It is suggested that ATP cleavage may be required for the activation of the enzyme."

The alternative possibility, in which one structural cistron with multiple mutational sites controls the synthesis of a single molecule cannot be excluded."
https://openalex.org/W1487151075,"Abstract Extracts of Clostridium pasteurianum have been separated into five protein fractions, which are necessary for nitrogen fixation when pyruvate is used as the source of energy and electrons. Pyruvate oxidase is shown to be heat-stable and to have gel filtration properties corresponding to a molecular weight of 100,000 or greater. The function of ferredoxin as an electron carrier for nitrogen fixation is verified. In addition, it is shown here that reduced ferredoxin can act as the sole source of electrons for nitrogen fixation and for acetylene reduction. Fraction C1S1, which is necessary for both nitrogen fixation and acetylene reduction, has gel filtration properties corresponding to a molecular weight of 100,000 or greater. Its activity is stable at 0° but not at 60°, and is found in nitrogen-grown cells but not in ammonium sulfate-grown cells. Fraction IVn, which is necessary for nitrogen fixation but not for acetylene reduction, is of a size corresponding to a molecular weight of 40,000. Its activity is present only in cells grown on nitrogen gas, and this activity is stable at 0° as well as at 60°. Fraction IVs is necessary for both nitrogen fixation and acetylene reduction, and its size corresponds to a molecular weight of about 45,000. Its activity, which is found in cells grown on either nitrogen gas or ammonium sulfate, is stable at 60° but not at 0°. The properties of these fractions are compared with those of similar fractions previously described."

https://openalex.org/W2098315691,"Abstract The circular dichroism of pyrocatechase exhibited several strong positive bands between 250 and 300 mµ, a moderate negative band at 327 mµ, and a weak and broad negative one around 500 mµ, in addition to a strong negative band at 222 mµ, which is characteristic of an α-helix in proteins. In the optical rotatory dispersion curve of the enzyme were discerned a few faint Cotton effects at 250 to 650 mµ and a strong one at 215 to 250 mµ. The negative circular dichroic bands at 327 and 500 mµ and a part of the positive bands between 250 and 300 mµ were associated with the enzyme activity. Upon removal of the bound iron, the bands at 327 and 500 mµ completely disappeared and those between 250 and 300 mµ were partially diminished. Upon incubation with ferrous ion under aerobic conditions these bands were restored to almost the original level. Therefore, the iron bound to the enzyme may be responsible for the circular dichroic bands as well as the enzyme activity. The disappearance of the bands above 300 mµ also occurred on addition of reducing agents, an indication that the iron in the enzyme is in the trivalent state, which is consistent with the previous results. In the presence of the substrate, catechol, under anerobic conditions, the magnitude and the position of the circular dichroic bands related to the enzyme activity changed, indicating the alteration of the state of ligands around the iron on binding of the substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1543763382,Abstract The binding of pyridoxamine 5-phosphate to the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase from pig heart was investigated by fluorescence spectroscopy. The substantial decrease in fluorescence intensity at 390 mµ that follows the interaction of pyridoxamine 5-phosphate with the apoenzyme was used to determine the affinity constant. The effect of pH on the stability of the apoenzyme-pyridoxamine 5-phosphate complex was examined and it is shown that at neutral pH the complex is characterized by an association constant of 1.5 x 107 m-1. These studies provide information on the firmness of binding of pyridoxamine 5-phosphate to the active site on the enzyme.
https://openalex.org/W1560802171,"Abstract Crystalline l-aspartate β-decarboxylase of Pseudomonas dacunhae was prepared by the following steps: sonic disruption, ammonium sulfate fractionation, heat treatment, DEAE-Sephadex chromatography, Sephadex G-150 gel filtration, and hydroxylapatite chromatography, followed by crystallization. This procedure yields a pure enzyme with a 32% recovery of the activity in crude cell-free extracts. The specific activity (84 µmoles of CO2 per min per mg) and the yield were significantly higher than those so far reported for the enzyme. The purified enzyme appeared to be homogeneous in the ultracentrifuge (s020,w = 20.7 S). Diffusion coefficient at zero protein concentration is 2.26 x 10-7 cm2 per sec. The intrinsic viscosity is 0.054 dl per g. The partial specific volume, V, is 0.72 ml per g. The molecular weight computed from sedimentation-diffusion data (795,000) is in good agreement with the value obtained from the Archibald method (820,000). The frictional ratio, f/fmin is 1.55. Electrolysis with carrier ampholytes revealed that this enzyme has an isoelectric point at around pH 4.2. The enzyme exhibits an absorption maxima at 278 mµ and about 360 mµ at pH 6.8. This enzyme contains approximately 16 moles of pyridoxal phosphate per mole of enzyme."

The rate of digestion was lower in suspensions pre-pared from rats treated with trypan blue than in control suspensions, but rates of lysosome breakage were not different. T'hese results and other experimental evidence suggest that trypanblue concentrated within lysosomes can inhibit intralysosomal digestion, probably by inhibition of lysosomal proteinases."

https://openalex.org/W1787562888,"Abstract The homopolymer complex, (dAn·dTn), will direct the synthesis of r(A)n or r(U)n, or both, in the presence of highly purified RNA polymerase from Micrococcus lysodeikticus. When either 14C-ATP or 3H-UTP is present with saturating amounts of (dAn·dTn), AMP incorporation is considerably greater than UMP incorporation. This difference appears to reflect a product inhibition which is observed only in the case of r(U)n synthesis. When both ATP and UTP are present with (dAn·dTn), each substrate exerts an influence on the incorporation rate of the other. UTP nonspecifically decreases AMP incorporation, whereas ATP specifically enhances UMP incorporation resulting in similar rates of incorporation for both substrates. This phenomenon occurs at all Mn++ and Mg++ concentrations, although the UMP:AMP incorporation ratio is highly dependent upon the metal ion concentration. Since the specific enhancement of UMP incorporation by ATP is not related to the template activity of nascent r(A)n, the coupling phenomenon is interpreted in terms of an interaction of the nascent r(A)n product with the nascent r(U)n product. Nascent r(A)n probably enhances the rate of UMP incorporation by facilitating the release of r(U)n, which would otherwise form a triple stranded complex with (dAn·dTn). This hypothesis is supported by the finding that r(U)n, added to the (dAn·dTn) template before the addition of RNA polymerase, completely blocks UMP incorporation but does not affect AMP incorporation. Since this interaction of the two complementary product strands must be immediate, it is suggested that both are simultaneously synthesized at the same site by a dimeric enzyme. A similar coupling phenomenon does not occur with the double stranded ribosyl template, r(A)n·r(U)n, and comparative studies indicate large kinetic differences between ribosyl and deoxyribosyl templates."
https://openalex.org/W2139190258,"Abstract In 0.05 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 20°), native rabbit muscle aldolase has been found to exhibit a molecular weight (Mn ∼ Mw ∼ Mz) close to 160,000, in agreement with previous findings. Upon exposure to cold alkaline borate buffer (pH 12.5, µ = 0.17, 0°), the enzyme spontaneously dissociates into its monomers which subsequently undergo slow hydrolytic degradation. Compensating for electrostatic charge effects and extrapolating the data to zero time in alkali, a subunit molecular weight of 41,400 to 42,000 is obtained. If the native enzyme is exposed to alkaline conditions at 20°, the subunits undergo an initial rapid degradation which eventually yields alkali-resistant material. Similar results are obtained with succinyl aldolase subunits under equivalent conditions. Acrylamide gel electrophoresis of alkali-treated succinyl aldolase (pH 12.5, 30°) results in the appearance of a limited number of electrophoretic bands. This finding suggests that specific alkali-labile peptide bonds are involved in the degradation process. As a further consequence of the action of alkali, native aldolase shows increased solubility properties. Both native and succinyl aldolase manifest new NH2-terminal serine, threonine, and glycine residues after treatment with borate buffer at pH 12.5 and 30°. Prolonged exposure to alkali results in increased liberation of the above end groups, but no evidence is obtained for other NH2-terminal residues except for a small amount of proline."
https://openalex.org/W1580230757,"Abstract Glutamate, a proposed precursor of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine, was isolated and degraded after metabolism of 14CO2 for 6 hours by Nicotiana rustica and Nicotiana glutinosa and after metabolism of acetate-2-14C for 2 hours by N. rustica. The 14C distribution in glutamate from N. glutinosa after 6 hours of 14CO2 metabolism was 20.2, 14.3, 13.9, 24.4, and 26.6%, in C-1 through C-5, respectively. The 14C distribution in nicotine under the same conditions was pyridine ring, 77.8%; C-2', 4.3%; C-3', 4.4%; C-4', 4.7%; C-5', 4.1%; and methyl carbon, 5.0%. The labeling pattern of the pyrrolidine ring is in agreement with the symmetrical intermediate pathway proposed for the formation of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine from glutamate. Similar results were obtained after 6 hours of 14CO2 incorporation into nicotine by N. rustica. After 3 hours of 14CO2 metabolism by N. glutinosa, 90.4% of the radioactivity was in the pyridine ring, 5.4% in the methyl group, and the remaining radioactivity was distributed equally among the carbon atoms of the pyrrolidine ring. Acetate-2-14C labeled glutamate in N. rustica as would be anticipated if acetate were metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid cycle: 1.5%, 5.4%, 4.6%, 81.0%, 2.8% in C-1 through C-5, respectively. The distribution of 14C in nicotine was: pyridine ring, 64.4%; C-2', 2.6%; C-3', 16.4%; C-4', 15.6%; C-5', 1.8%; and methyl carbon, 1.6%. These results support the symmetrical intermediate hypothesis for the formation of the pyrrolidine ring of nicotine proposed on the basis of previous precursor experiments."

https://openalex.org/W1504601754,"Abstract 1. When inorganic sulfide is included in the assay medium the activity of a glycyl transfer RNA synthetase from yeast becomes completely dependent upon glutathione or an alkali-denatured protein, although in a conventional test without sulfide no additive of this kind is required. At low concentrations, GSH and alkali-denatured protein potentiate each other's effect, suggesting that they function in the presence of sulfide as activators which associate with two different sites in the enzyme molecule. GSH cannot be replaced by dithiothreitol or mercaptoethanol, but cysteine and cysteamine are effective. 2. When the partially purified enzyme was stored for 10 months the catalytic activity fell to about 5% of the original, even if measured in the presence of dithiothreitol or sulfide plus GSH and denatured protein. It could be most effectively retrieved by a relatively severe treatment with inorganic sulfide. 3. The two sets of observations summarized above are interpreted to indicate that the isolated enzyme can contain artifactual disulfide bonds which are unusually resistant to reduction by thiols but can be cleaved with sulfide. One such artifactual bond may prevent normal operation of the regulatory mechanism in the first case above, and another may inhibit the catalytic mechanism in the second. The suggestion is made that this type of phenomenon could underlie certain anomalous properties found in vitro with other enzymes."

https://openalex.org/W1518240940,"Abstract Phosphoglucomutase from rabbit skeletal muscle has been labeled with 32P by incubation with 1-32P-labeled 1,3-diphosphoglycerate. The product was not retained on columns of carboxymethyl cellulose and could thus be separated from nonphosphorylated species. Incubation with 1,3-diphosphoglycerate caused an increase in the proportion of phosphoenzyme as judged chromatographically. The evidence that the labeling occurred at the enzyme's active site is that (a) the incorporation was inhibited by glucose 1-phosphate; (b) the incorporated label was not removed by boiling in n acid but was labile to weak alkali; (c) incubation of the reisolated enzyme with glucose-1-P released the label as organic phosphate; and (d) in all studies, the labeled enzyme behaved the same as that labeled by exchange with glucose phosphates. Phosphoryl transfer from 1,3-diphosphoglycerate to phosphoglyceratemutase, phosphorylase b, or the phosphoenzyme form of phosphoglucomutase was not observed."
