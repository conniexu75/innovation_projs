https://openalex.org/W2075618444,"MANY reports1–5 indicate that plants in a closed system will reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air to a minimum value between 50 and 100 p.p.m. Gabrielsen2 postulates “there exists a threshold value for carbon dioxide in photosynthesis, which for elder leaves is about 0.0090 volume per cent. Below the threshold no assimilation takes place. Thus it seems that only about two-thirds of the atmospheric carbon dioxide is available for photosynthesis”."

The responses were of two types. Under conditions of direct-coupled amplification, with glass pipette electrodes recording extracellularly from the retinal surface, the response consisted of an increase in negativity maintained throughout prolonged illumination. With capacitance-coupled amplification and metal electrodes, brisk mass discharges of nerve impulses were detected at the onset and cessation of illumination. During illumination a less vigorous maintained discharge was observed."

https://openalex.org/W2345716877,"Numerous investigations have led to the point at which refined enzyme systems may be used to study the biosynthesis of saturated fatty acids (2, 3). The biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids has not been so thoroughly elucidated. Formation of unsaturated fatty acids has been observed experimentally in viva (4-9) and in vitro (10, 11) but several of these studies showed that incorporated radioactivity was distributed in the fatty acids in proportions quite different from the naturally occurring fatty acid composition. Whenever differences were found, the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids was low. Early experiments with slices, homogenates, and cell-free preparations from avocado mesocarp produced variable amounts of oleic and saturated fatty acid. It was, therefore, not feasible to compare the avocado system with that in a strain of Saccharomyces ceretisiae, which converted saturated fatty acids to unsaturated fatty acids by reactions requiring reduced triphosphopyridine nucleotide and oxygen (11). This report described conditions under which oleic acid is the principal acid formed from acetate by particulate preparations from avocado mesocarp. It is shown that oxygen is an absolute requirement for oleate biosynthesis in avocado."

https://openalex.org/W1970184257,"A STRAIN of mice suffering from hæmolytic anæmia of the autoimmune type has been established by one of us (M. B.). This strain designated NZB/Bl is now in the 52nd generation of brother–sister mating. Serological signs of the disease, such as agglutinating antibodies1 and positive Coombs's tests2, appear in a few animals from the 4th month of life onward, the incidence rising to virtually 100 per cent in animals older than 9 months."

https://openalex.org/W2020392520,A melanotic cell line derived from a malignant melanoma of the golden hamster has retained its ability to produce melanin in vitro. This cell line provides an opportunity for studying the synthesis of melanin under various controlled conditions. The modal chromosome number in this cell line is 68.

https://openalex.org/W1984429603,"Tonic immobility (""animal hypnosis"" or catatonic trance) could not be induced in 1-year-old foster lambs and kids. Control animals, conforming to a characteristic of their species, could be readily immobilized. The suggested explanation for this difference in behavior is that the foster animals did not develop a normal flight distance because of the ambivalent behavior of the ""stepmother,"" who alternately permitted and refused nursing."

https://openalex.org/W1984368789,"There is a marked decline in some intellectual abilities in old age. It is frequently hypothesized that impaired cerebral physiology accounts for some of this deficit. In old age the critical flicker frequency, a measure sensitive to cerebral dysfunction, is correlated with aging intellectual abilities. This is interpreted as evidence supporting the above hypothesis."

https://openalex.org/W2076373980,The study of exchange reaction kinetics between sulfur-35 and organic compounds which contain sulfur can be made much easier by use of radiochromatography. Activity ratios of the components of the reaction mixture can be estimated by use of very small amounts of radioactive materials. The reaction need not be halted and individual components need not be isolated. Any degradation of reacting substances can be measured quantitatively at the same time.
