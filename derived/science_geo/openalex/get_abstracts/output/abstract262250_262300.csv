https://openalex.org/W2098508266,"Tandem solar cells, in which two solar cells with different absorption characteristics are linked to use a wider range of the solar spectrum, were fabricated with each layer processed from solution with the use of bulk heterojunction materials comprising semiconducting polymers and fullerene derivatives. A transparent titanium oxide (TiO x ) layer separates and connects the front cell and the back cell. The TiO x layer serves as an electron transport and collecting layer for the first cell and as a stable foundation that enables the fabrication of the second cell to complete the tandem cell architecture. We use an inverted structure with the low band-gap polymer-fullerene composite as the charge-separating layer in the front cell and the high band-gap polymer composite as that in the back cell. Power-conversion efficiencies of more than 6% were achieved at illuminations of 200 milliwatts per square centimeter."

https://openalex.org/W1994602890,"Plants sense potential microbial invaders by using pattern-recognition receptors to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). In Arabidopsis thaliana, the leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases flagellin-sensitive 2 (FLS2) (ref. 2) and elongation factor Tu receptor (EFR) (ref. 3) act as pattern-recognition receptors for the bacterial PAMPs flagellin and elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) (ref. 5) and contribute to resistance against bacterial pathogens. Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that link receptor activation to intracellular signal transduction. Here we show that BAK1 (BRI1-associated receptor kinase 1), a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase that has been reported to regulate the brassinosteroid receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), is involved in signalling by FLS2 and EFR. Plants carrying bak1 mutations show normal flagellin binding but abnormal early and late flagellin-triggered responses, indicating that BAK1 acts as a positive regulator in signalling. The bak1-mutant plants also show a reduction in early, but not late, EF-Tu-triggered responses. The decrease in responses to PAMPs is not due to reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids. We provide evidence that FLS2 and BAK1 form a complex in vivo, in a specific ligand-dependent manner, within the first minutes of stimulation with flagellin. Thus, BAK1 is not only associated with developmental regulation through the plant hormone receptor BRI1 (refs 6,7), but also has a functional role in PRR-dependent signalling, which initiates innate immunity."

https://openalex.org/W2078527697,"Substances that accumulate to hazardous levels in living organisms pose environmental and human-health risks, which governments seek to reduce or eliminate. Regulatory authorities identify bioaccumulative substances as hydrophobic, fat-soluble chemicals having high octanol-water partition coefficients ( K OW )(≥100,000). Here we show that poorly metabolizable, moderately hydrophobic substances with a K OW between 100 and 100,000, which do not biomagnify (that is, increase in chemical concentration in organisms with increasing trophic level) in aquatic food webs, can biomagnify to a high degree in food webs containing air-breathing animals (including humans) because of their high octanol-air partition coefficient ( K OA ) and corresponding low rate of respiratory elimination to air. These low K OW –high K OA chemicals, representing a third of organic chemicals in commercial use, constitute an unidentified class of potentially bioaccumulative substances that require regulatory assessment to prevent possible ecosystem and human-health consequences."

https://openalex.org/W2008394459,"A single sheet of carbon, graphene, exhibits unexpected electronic properties that arise from quantum state symmetries, which restrict the scattering of its charge carriers. Understanding the role of defects in the transport properties of graphene is central to realizing future electronics based on carbon. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy was used to measure quasiparticle interference patterns in epitaxial graphene grown on SiC(0001). Energy-resolved maps of the local density of states reveal modulations on two different length scales, reflecting both intravalley and intervalley scattering. Although such scattering in graphene can be suppressed because of the symmetries of the Dirac quasiparticles, we show that, when its source is atomic-scale lattice defects, wave functions of different symmetries can mix."

https://openalex.org/W1978291265,"Water is predicted to be among the most abundant (if not the most abundant) molecular species after hydrogen in the atmospheres of close-in extrasolar giant planets ('hot Jupiters'). Several attempts have been made to detect water on such planets, but have either failed to find compelling evidence for it or led to claims that should be taken with caution. Here we report an analysis of recent observations of the hot Jupiter HD 189733b (ref. 6) taken during the transit, when the planet passed in front of its parent star. We find that absorption by water vapour is the most likely cause of the wavelength-dependent variations in the effective radius of the planet at the infrared wavelengths 3.6 mum, 5.8 mum (both ref. 7) and 8 mum (ref. 8). The larger effective radius observed at visible wavelengths may arise from either stellar variability or the presence of clouds/hazes. We explain the report of a non-detection of water on HD 189733b (ref. 4) as being a consequence of the nearly isothermal vertical profile of the planet's atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W2088640169,"Whether memories can be suppressed has been a controversial issue in psychology and cognitive neuroscience for decades. We found evidence that emotional memories are suppressed via two time-differentiated neural mechanisms: (i) an initial suppression by the right inferior frontal gyrus over regions supporting sensory components of the memory representation (visual cortex, thalamus), followed by (ii) right medial frontal gyrus control over regions supporting multimodal and emotional components of the memory representation (hippocampus, amygdala), both of which are influenced by fronto-polar regions. These results indicate that memory suppression does occur and, at least in nonpsychiatric populations, is under the control of prefrontal regions."
https://openalex.org/W2054607545,"Many human cancers involve up-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase PI3Kα, with oncogenic mutations identified in both the p110α catalytic and the p85α regulatory subunits. We used crystallographic and biochemical approaches to gain insight into activating mutations in two noncatalytic p110α domains—the adaptor-binding and the helical domains. A structure of the adaptor-binding domain of p110α in a complex with the p85α inter–Src homology 2 (inter-SH2) domain shows that oncogenic mutations in the adaptor-binding domain are not at the inter-SH2 interface but in a polar surface patch that is a plausible docking site for other domains in the holo p110/p85 complex. We also examined helical domain mutations and found that the Glu 545 to Lys 545 (E545K) oncogenic mutant disrupts an inhibitory charge-charge interaction with the p85 N-terminal SH2 domain. These studies extend our understanding of the architecture of PI3Ks and provide insight into how two classes of mutations that cause a gain in function can lead to cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2088339088,"Type Ia supernovae are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs that reach a critical mass limit. Despite their importance as cosmological distance indicators, the nature of their progenitors has remained controversial. Here we report the detection of circumstellar material in a normal Type Ia supernova. The expansion velocities, densities and dimensions of the circumstellar envelope indicate that this material was ejected from the progenitor system. The relatively low expansion velocities appear to favor a progenitor system where a white dwarf accretes material from a companion star which is in the red-giant phase at the time of explosion."
https://openalex.org/W1991138062,"Strombolian-type eruptive activity, common at many volcanoes, consists of regular explosions driven by the bursting of gas slugs that rise faster than surrounding magma. Explosion quakes associated with this activity are usually localized at shallow depth; however, where and how slugs actually form remain poorly constrained. We used spectroscopic measurements performed during both quiescent degassing and explosions on Stromboli volcano (Italy) to demonstrate that gas slugs originate from as deep as the volcano-crust interface (approximately 3 kilometers), where both structural discontinuities and differential bubble-rise speed can promote slug coalescence. The observed decoupling between deep slug genesis and shallow (approximately 250-meter) explosion quakes may be a common feature of strombolian activity, determined by the geometry of plumbing systems."
https://openalex.org/W2078427400,"Faithful chromosome segregation and repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) require cohesin, the protein complex that mediates sister-chromatid cohesion. Cohesion between sister chromatids is thought to be generated only during ongoing DNA replication by an obligate coupling between cohesion establishment factors such as Eco1 (Ctf7) and the replisome. Using budding yeast, we challenge this model by showing that cohesion is generated by an Eco1-dependent but replication-independent mechanism in response to DSBs in G 2 /M. Furthermore, our studies reveal that Eco1 has two functions: a cohesive activity and a conserved acetyltransferase activity, which triggers the generation of cohesion in response to the DSB and the DNA damage checkpoint. Finally, the DSB-induced cohesion is not limited to broken chromosomes but occurs also on unbroken chromosomes, suggesting that the DNA damage checkpoint through Eco1 provides genome-wide protection of chromosome integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1982367970,"Sister-chromatid cohesion, established during replication by the protein complex cohesin, is essential for both chromosome segregation and double-strand break (DSB) repair. Normally, cohesion formation is strictly limited to the S phase of the cell cycle, but DSBs can trigger cohesion also after DNA replication has been completed. The function of this damage-induced cohesion remains unknown. In this investigation, we show that damage-induced cohesion is essential for repair in postreplicative cells in yeast. Furthermore, it is established genome-wide after induction of a single DSB, and it is controlled by the DNA damage response and cohesin-regulating factors. We thus define a cohesion establishment pathway that is independent of DNA duplication and acts together with cohesion formed during replication in sister chromatid-based DSB repair."
https://openalex.org/W2075639945,"The temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression in mammalian development is linked to the establishment of functional chromatin domains. Here, we report that tissue-specific transcription of a retrotransposon repeat in the murine growth hormone locus is required for gene activation. This repeat serves as a boundary to block the influence of repressive chromatin modifications. The repeat element is able to generate short, overlapping Pol II-and Pol III-driven transcripts, both of which are necessary and sufficient to enable a restructuring of the regulated locus into nuclear compartments. These data suggest that transcription of interspersed repetitive sequences may represent a developmental strategy for the establishment of functionally distinct domains within the mammalian genome to control gene activation."

https://openalex.org/W2091381804,"Diffraction restricts the ability of most electromagnetic devices to image or selectively target objects smaller than the wavelength. We describe planar subwavelength structures capable of focusing well beyond the diffraction limit, operating at arbitrary frequencies. The structure design, related to that of Fresnel plates, forces the input field to converge to a spot on the focal plane. However, unlike the diffraction-limited zone plates, for which focusing results from the interference of traveling waves, the subwavelength plates control the near field and, as such, their superlensing properties originate from a static form of interference. Practical implementations of these plates hold promise for near-field data storage, noncontact sensing, imaging, and nanolithography applications."

https://openalex.org/W1968940692,"Hepatocyte lipoapoptosis, a critical feature of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, can be replicated in vitro by incubating hepatocytes with saturated free fatty acids (FFA). These toxic FFA induce Bim expression, which is requisite for their cytotoxicity. Because the FoxO3a transcription factor has been implicated in Bim expression, our aim was to determine if FFA induce Bim by a FoxO3a-dependent mechanism. In Huh-7 cells, the saturated FFA, palmitic and stearic acid, increased Bim mRNA 16-fold. Treatment of cells with the saturated FFA induced FoxO3a dephosphorylation (activation) and nuclear translocation and stimulated a FoxO luciferase-based reporter assay; direct binding of FoxO3a to the Bim promoter was also confirmed by a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. A small interfering RNA-targeted knockdown of FoxO3a abrogated FFA-mediated Bim induction and apoptosis. FoxO3a was activated by a phosphatase 2A-dependent mechanism, since okadaic acid- and small interfering RNA-targeted knockdown of this phosphatase blocked FoxO3a dephosphorylation, Bim expression, and apoptosis. Consistent with these data, phosphatase 2A activity was also stimulated 3-fold by saturated FFA. Immunoprecpitation studies revealed an FFA-dependent association between FoxO3a and protein phosphatase 2A. FFA-mediated FoxO3a activation by protein phosphatase 2A was also observed in HepG2 cells and murine hepatocytes. In conclusion, saturated FFA stimulate protein phosphatase 2A activity, which activates FoxO3a, inducing expression of the intracellular death mediator Bim.

This hepatic inflammatory disorder can progress to cirrhosis, chronic liver disease with portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Matteoni C.A. Younossi Z.M. Gramlich T. Boparai N.

A major risk factor for NASH is insulin resistance occurring within the context of the metabolic syndrome (3Angulo P. Keach J.C. Batts K.P. Lindor K.D.

Marchesini G. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 987-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). This lipolysis liberates free fatty acids from neutral fat. The liberated intracellular free fatty acids (FFA) are released into the serum, where they are taken up by the liver (6Donnelly K.L. Smith C.I. Schwarzenberg S.J. Jessurun J. Boldt M.D. Parks E.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 1343-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (2280) Google Scholar). Indeed, the bulk of hepatic neutral fat in NASH is derived from re-esterification of circulating FFA (6Donnelly K.L.

Given this information, it is not surprising that elevated serum FFA are a hallmark of NASH (7Nehra V. Angulo P. Buchman A.L. Lindor K.D. Dig. Dis. Sci. 2001; 46: 2347-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 8Feldstein A.E. Canbay A. Guicciardi M.E. Higuchi H. Bronk S.F. Gores G.J. J.

Therapies that improve NASH by enhancing insulin sensitivity also decrease plasma FFA (9Belfort R. Harrison S.A. Brown K. Darland C. Finch J. Hardies J. Balas B. Gastaldelli A. Tio F. Pulcini J.

Med. 2002; 53: 319-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Indeed, hepatocyte apoptosis is a cardinal feature of NASH and correlates with hepatic inflammation and fibrosis (8Feldstein A.E.

Consistent with this concept, elevated serum cytokeratin-18 fragments, markers of hepatocyte apoptosis, distinguish simple hepatic steatosis from NASH (13Wieckowska A. Zein N.N. Yerian L.M. Lopez A.R. McCullough A.J. Feldstein A.E. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). FFA also induce hepatocyte apoptosis in vitro; in this model, saturated FFA (e.g. stearic or palmitic acid) are more toxic than the unsaturated FFA (e.g. oleic acid). Toxic, saturated FFA induce hepatocyte apoptosis, in part, by the up-regulation of Bim (Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death), a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) protein family (10Malhi H. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12093-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In fact, FFA-mediated hepatocyte apoptosis is abrogated by siRNA-targeted knockdown of Bim (10Malhi H. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12093-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Bim belongs to a subset of the Bcl-2 protein family which displays sequence conservation exclusively in the short Bcl-2 homology 3 (BH3) domain and are referred to as BH3-only proteins. These proteins are biosensors of cellular stress and induce apoptosis by functioning as intracellular death ligands (14Willis S.N. Adams J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2005; 17: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). BH3-only proteins such as Bim bind to multidomain members of the Bcl-2 family, causing mitochondria dysfunction, with release of proapoptotic factors into the cytosol (e.g. cytochrome c, SMAC/Diablo, endonuclease G, and AIF) (15Martinou J.C. Green D.R. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 63-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar). Cytosolic cytochrome c promotes activation of downstream effector caspase-3 and -7, proteases that dismantle the cell, causing cell death by apoptosis (16Guicciardi M.E. Gores G.J. Gut. 2005; 54: 1024-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Bim exists at the protein level as three isoforms, including Bim extra long (BimEL), Bim long (BimL), and Bim short (BimS) (17Bouillet P. Huang D.C. O'Reilly L.A. Puthalakath H. O'Connor L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). All three isoforms are regulated by both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. FFA markedly enhance cellular Bim mRNA levels and therefore probably regulate Bim expression by a transcriptional mechanism (10Malhi H. Bronk S.F. Werneburg N.W. Gores G.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12093-12101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Bim mRNA expression is regulated by a member of the FoxO (Forkhead box-containing protein, class O) family of transcription factors, FoxO3a (18Dijkers P.F. Medema R.H. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. Coffer P.J. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 1201-1204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 19Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M. Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M. Medema R.H. J.

This transcription factor is deactivated by kinase-directed phosphorylation and activated by phosphatase-mediated dephosphorylation (21Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 22Yin K.J. Hsu C.Y. Hu X.Y. Chen H. Chen S.W. Xu J. Lee J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2290-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). FoxO3a factor resides in the nucleus, where it is a positive regulator of gene expression. However, upon phosphorylation, FoxO3a is transported out of the nucleus and sequestered in the cytosol, where it is bound to the protein 14-3-3 (21Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Once sequestered in the cytoplasm, it can be reactivated by dephospohorylation via a serine/threonine phosphatase pathway (22Yin K.J. Hsu C.Y. Hu X.Y. Chen H. Chen S.W. Xu J. Lee J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2290-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Both Akt and serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) phosphorylate FoxO3a at the same sites, albeit with different affinities, Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315 (23Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J.

Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). There is cooperativity between these sites such that identification of Thr32 phosphorylation can be used to indicate phosphorylation of the other two sites (24Brunet A. Park J. Tran H. Hu L.S. Hemmings B.A. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 952-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Reactivation of phosphorylated FoxO3a probably occurs via the ubiquitous threonine/serine phosphatase, protein phosphatase 2A (22Yin K.J. Hsu C.Y. Hu X.Y. Chen H. Chen S.W. Xu J. Lee J.M. J. Neurosci. 2006; 26: 2290-2299Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, both cellular localization, nuclear versus cytosolic, and Thr32 phosphorylation (negative regulator) can be used to assess the FoxO3a activation status. The major objectives of this study were to determine if FFA regulate Bim expression via FoxO3a. The results indicate that toxic FFA preferentially induce Bim expression and cell death by a FoxO3a-dependent mechanism. This activation (dephosphorylation) of FoxO3a is mediated by FFA-stimulated protein phosphatase 2A activity. Cells—Huh-7 cells, a human hepatoma cell line, and HepG2 cells, a human hepatoblastoma cell line, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose (25 mm), 100,000 units/liter penicillin, 100 mg/liter streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. Mouse hepatocytes were isolated from C57BL/6 (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) by collagenase perfusion, purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation, and plated as primary cultures (25Faubion W.A. Guicciardi M.E. Miyoshi H. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Svingen P.A. Kaufmann S.H. Gores G.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar).

Stably transfected clones were selected in medium containing 1200 mg/liter G418 and screened by immunoblot analysis. Fatty Acid Treatment—Stearic, palmitic, and oleic acid were from Sigma. All three FFA were individually dissolved in isopropyl alcohol at a concentration of 40 mm. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin was used in all experiments. The concentration of fatty acids used was 400 μm. The concentration of the vehicle, isopropyl alcohol, was 1% in final incubations. Control cells were treated with vehicle alone. Cells were treated when ∼60% confluent. Quantitation of Apoptosis—Nuclei were stained with 5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidine-2′-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 30 min at room temperature and visualized under fluorescence microscopy (Nikon Eclipse TE200, Nikon Corporation, Japan). Apoptotic cells were quantified by counting 400 random cells per study. Cells with the characteristic nuclear changes of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were considered apoptotic. Apoptosis was expressed as a percentage of total cells counted. Caspase-3/7 Activity—Cells were plated in 96-well plates (Corning Glass). A caspase assay was performed using the commercially available Apo-ONE homogeneous caspase-3/7 assay (Promega Corp.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, this assay involves cleavage of a profluorescent caspase-3/7 consensus substrate, bis-(N-benzyloxycarbonyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-aspartic acid amide) conjugated to rhodamine 110 (benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-R110) on its C-terminal side. Proteolytic cleavage liberates rhodamine 110, unquenching its fluorescence, and was measured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 498 and 521 nm, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was acquired by a microplate fluorescence reader (FLx800; Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT). The amount of fluorescent product generated is proportional to the amount of caspase-3/7 cleavage activity present in the sample. Immunocytochemistry—Cells were cultured on collagen-coated coverslips. The medium was aspirated, and the cells were washed three times with PBS and then fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. After another washing step with PBS, cells were permeabilized using 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 20 min at room temperature. Next the cells were incubated in PBS containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 N NaN3, and 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 20 min. Primary antibody incubation was carried out with anti-FoxO3a (1:200 dilution, rabbit, 07-702; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) for 1 h at room temperature. After another washing step with PBS, the cells were incubated with the secondary antibody, Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:1000; Jackson Immunological Research Laboratories, Inc.), for 30 min at room temperature. All antibodies were diluted in PBS plus 5% fetal bovine serum. The slides were stained with 0.2 μg/ml DAPI diluted in PBS for 5 min at room temperature and then washed three times in PBS. Next, the coverslips were removed, and Prolong antifade (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) was used as mounting medium. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy with an inverted Zeiss laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Inc., Thornwood, NJ). Individual nuclei were outlined using DAPI fluorescence, and the nuclear fluorescence of Cy3 was quantified using Zeiss KS400 image analysis software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Oberkochen, Germany). Nuclear FoxO3a fluorescence was expressed as an increase in total nuclear fluorescence intensity per cell (pixels above threshold × fluorescence intensity). Immunoblot Analysis—Cells were lysed for 30 min on ice with lysis buffer (50 mm/liter Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/mol aprotinin, 1 μg/mol leupeptin, 1 μg/mol pepstatin, 1 m Na3VO4, and 1 mm NaF). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 15 min, protein concentration in the supernatant was measured using Bradford's reagent (Bio-Rad). The supernatant protein was denatured by boiling for 10 min. Protein (40 μg) was resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4–15% gradient gel and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Blocking was carried out using 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies (Ab) were diluted in blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C: polyclonal Ab to FoxO3a (7-702) and polyclonal Ab to phopho-FoxO3a (Thr32) (7-695) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology); monoclonal Ab to Bim (MAB17001) (rat, 1:1000 dilution; Chemicon, Australia); monoclonal Ab to phospho-Akt (Ser473) (4051) (mouse, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); polyclonal Ab to Akt (9272) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal Ab to IKK-β (2684) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal Ab to phospho-IKK-α/β (2694) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal Ab to IkB-α (sc-371) (goat, 1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA); polyclonal Ab to PP2A catalytic subunit α isoform clone 1D6 (05-421) (mouse, 1:5000 dilution; Upstate Biotechnology); monoclonal phospho-PP2A (Tyr307) (1155-1) (rabbit, 1:5000 dilution; Epitomics, Burlingame, CA); polyclonal Ab to PTEN (9552) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology); polyclonal Ab to phospho-PTEN (Ser380/Thr382/383) (9554) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); polyclonal Ab to SGK (3272) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA); polyclonal Ab to phospho-SGK (Ser255/Thr256) (9554) (rabbit, 1:1000 dilution; Upstate Technology); monoclonal Ab to γ-tubulin (T6557) (mouse, 1:5000 dilution; Sigma); polyclonal Ab to actin (sc-1615) (goat, 1:2000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). To detect antigen-antibody complexes, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:3000; BIO-SOURCE, Camarillo, CA) were diluted in blocking solution and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. Immune complexes were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (ECL; Amersham Biosciences), and Eastman Kodak Co. X-Omat film. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation for HA-FoxO3a was performed with 2 μg of anti-HA (rat monoclonal Ab; Roche Applied Science) or 2 μg of anti-PP2A-C (Upstate Biotechnology) in 1.0 mg of whole lysate protein. Samples were first precleared with protein G-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories, Inc.) for 30 min. Precleared lysates were centrifuged to discard the beads and incubated with anti-HA or anti-PP2A-C for 4 h and then incubated overnight with protein G-Sepharose. Samples were washed six times with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoblot analysis as described above. Akt and Phospho-Akt Immunoreactivity by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—Akt and phospho-Akt immunoreactivity were measured using a commercially available fast activated cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde followed by quenching of endogenous peroxidase with 1% H2O2 and 0.1% sodium azide in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. Each well was incubated with antibody specific to total Akt or phospho-Akt. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was subsequently added and developed with the commercial reagent. Absorption was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer. Cell number was quantitated by crystal violet staining. Akt and phospho-Akt immunoreactivity was normalized to cell number. Reporter Gene Assay—The luciferase reporter construct 3×IRS-Luc, which contains three copies of the FoxO-responsive element from the IGFBP1 promoter, was obtained from K. L. Guan (27Tang E.D. Nunez G. Barr F.G. Guan K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16741-16746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (653) Google Scholar). Twenty-four hours after the transfection, cells were incubated with 400 μm FFA, and control cells were incubated with vehicle alone for 6 h. Cells were washed two times with PBS, and then cell lysates were prepared by adding lysis buffer directly to the cells for 20 min at 4 °C on a rocking shacker platform. Next, both firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were quantitated using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Luciferase was quantified using a luminometer (TD-20/20, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction—Total RNA was extracted from the cells using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and was reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA with Moloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primers (both from Invitrogen). Quantification of the complementary DNA template was performed with real time PCR (LightCycler; Roche Applied Science) using SYBR green (Molecular Probes) as a fluorophore. PCR primers were as follows: for human BIM, forward (5′-TATGAGAAGATCCTCCCTGC-3′) and reverse (5′-ATATCTGCAGGTTCAGCCTG-3′); for human PP2A-Cα, forward (5′-GAATCCAACGTGCAAGAGGT-3′) and reverse (5′-CGTTCACGGTAACGAACCTT-3′); for human PP1C, forward (5′-GACAGCGAGAAGCTCAACCT-3′) and reverse (5′-CTCCAGCTCCAGAAGAATGG-3′); for murine bim, forward (5′-CGACAGTCTCAGGAGGAACC-3′) and reverse (5′-CCTTCTCCATACCAGACGGA-3′). As an internal control, primers for 18 S ribosomal RNA were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). After electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel, each expected base pair PCR product was cut out and eluted into Tris-HCl using a DNA elution kit (gel extraction kit; Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The concentrations of extracted PCR products (copies/μl) were measured using a spectrophotometer at 260 nm and were used to generate standard curves. The inverse linear relationship between copy and cycle numbers was then determined. Each resulting standard curve was then used to calculate the number of copies/μl in experimental samples. The relative expression level of each product was expressed as a ratio of 18 S ribosomal copies of PCR product for each sample. siRNA-targeted Knockdown of FoxO3A and PP2A—RNA interference was used to knock down FoxO3a and PP2A protein expression in Huh-7 cells. The FoxO3a siRNA sequence corresponds to the coding region 46–64 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. FoxO3a sense (5′-ACUCCGGGUCCAGCUCCAC(dTdT)-3′)/FoxO3a antisense (5′-GUGGAGCUGGACCCGGAGU(dTdT)-3′) targeting human FoxO3a was synthesized using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). The protein phosphatase 2A, catalytic subunit, α isoform (siRNA-PP2A-C) was purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). As a control, cells were also transfected with scrambled RNA duplex with the sequence 5′-AACGTGATTTATGTCACCAGA-3′. FoxO3a and PP2A-C knockdown were performed by transfection of siRNA into cells using siPORT lipid transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Successful targeted knockdown was verified by real time PCR after transient transfection of the cells with siRNA. Briefly, cells were grown in 12-well dishes and were transiently transfected with 50 nm siRNA-FoxO3a or 100 nm siRNA-PP2A-C, using 6 μl/ml siPORT lipid (Ambion) in a total transfection volume of 0.5 ml of Opti-MEM (Invitrogen). After incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 4 h, 1 ml of normal growth medium was added. Transfected cells were then analyzed for apoptosis, immunoblot, and real time PCR as described elsewhere under “Experimental Procedures.” Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using a commercially available assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were incubated with 1% formaldehyde in media at 37 °C for 20 min to cross-link DNA and DNA-binding proteins. After washing in PBS, cells were collected and lysed within 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer supplied by the kit. DNA within the cell extracts was sheared by sonication with four sets of 10-s pulses using a sonicator (Sonifier cell disruptor; Heat Systems-Ultrasonics, Plainview, NY) equipped with a 2-mm tip and set to 30% of maximum power. The cell lysates were next subjected to 13,000 × g for 10 min. The DNA concentration in the supernatant was quantified by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. Samples containing 200 μg of DNA were diluted with the chromatin immunoprecipitation dilution buffer to a final volume of 2,050 μl. Fifty microliters from each sample were removed as a nonimmunoprecipitation input control. After preclearing the sample with 75 μl of salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry at 4 °C for 30 min, the target protein FoxO3a was immunoprecipitated with 2 μg of anti-FoxO3a polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight with rotation using a multipurpose rotator (model 151; Scientific Industries, Bohemia, NY). A mock immunoprecipitation without antibody was also performed. Next, 60 μl of the salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose slurry was added and incubated at 4 °C for 60 min. After washing the agarose beads, the protein A-agarose immune complexes were eluted, in two separate 250-μl aliquots, in elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 mol/liter NaHCO3) at room temperature for 30 min. Twenty-five microliters of each eluent was used for immunoblot analysis to determine the immunoprecipitation efficiency. Following the addition of 5 m NaCl (20 μl), protein-DNA cross-linking was reversed by heating at 65 °C for 6 h. After digestion with 2 μl of 10 mg/ml proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h, DNA fragments were purified via phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the DNA pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of water. The following PCR primers were employed to amplify the product spanning the FoxO3a-specific binding site identified in the 5′-flanking region of the human BIM gene: forward, 5′-TCGCGAGGACCAACCCAGTC-3′; reverse, 5′-CCGCTCCTACGCCCAATCAC-3′. The copy number for amplified PCR products was quantitated using real time PCR. Protein Phosphatase 2A Activity—A commercially available PP2A immunoprecipitation phosphatase assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) was used to measure phosphate release as an index of phosphatase activity. Briefly, Huh-7 cells and HepG2 cells were treated with 400 μm FFA for 6–8 h, and vehicle was used as control. Then total cellular proteins were extracted in a phosphatase extra"
https://openalex.org/W1989711933,"HFE C282Y, the mutant protein associated with hereditary hemochromatosis (HH), fails to acquire the correct conformation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is targeted for degradation. We have recently shown that an active unfolded protein response (UPR) is present in the cells of patients with HH. Now, by using HEK 293T cells, we demonstrate that the stability of HFE C282Y is influenced by the UPR signaling pathway that promotes its degradation. Treatment of HFE C282Y-expressing cells with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), a bile acid derivative with chaperone properties, or with the chemical chaperone sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) impeded the UPR activation. However, although TUDCA led to an increased stability of the mutant protein, 4PBA contributed to a more efficient disposal of HFE C282Y to the degradation route. Fluorescence microscopy and biochemical analysis of the subcellular localization of HFE revealed that a major portion of the C282Y mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates. Although neither TUDCA nor 4PBA restored the correct folding and intracellular trafficking of HFE C282Y, 4PBA prevented its aggregation. These data suggest that TUDCA hampers the UPR activation by acting directly on its signal transduction pathway, whereas 4PBA suppresses ER stress by chemically enhancing the ER capacity to cope with the expression of misfolded HFE, facilitating its degradation. Together, these data shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in HFE C282Y-related HH and open new perspectives on the use of orally active chemical chaperones as a therapeutic approach for HH.

A large number of diseases result from protein misfolding and aggregation.

HFE, a type I transmembrane glycoprotein homologous to major histocompatibility complex I, interacts with β2-microglobulin, and only the HFE/β2-microglobulin heterodimer is able to reach the cell surface through the standard secretory pathway (1Feder J.N.

The C282Y mutation in HFE prevents the formation of an intra-molecular disulfide bridge in the α3 domain of HFE blocking β2-microglobulin association and the trafficking of the protein to the cell surface (2Feder J.N. Tsuchihashi Z. Irrinki A. Lee V.K. Mapa F.A. Morikang E. Prass C.E. Starnes S.M. Wolff R.K. Parkkila S. Sly W.S. Schatzman R.C. J. Biol.

The resulting misfolded protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and subjected to accelerated proteasomal degradation (3Waheed A. Parkkila S. Zhou X.Y. Tomatsu S. Tsuchihashi Z.

It has been known for some time that some compounds collectively called chemical chaperones have the ability to stabilize proteins in their native conformation contributing in some cases to rescue of the folding defect of mutant proteins (5Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). One well studied example of this mechanism is the restoration of the cell surface expression and function of the mutant cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator protein by chemical chaperones (6Brown C.R. Hong-Brown L.Q. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. Welch W.J. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It is thought, however, that these compounds may be effective in a number of other protein folding defects, thus providing an interesting therapeutic approach for a large number of different human diseases (7Chaudhuri T.K. Paul S. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1331-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). We have recently reported that cells expressing HFE C282Y have an active unfolded protein response (UPR) (8de Almeida S.F. Fleming J.V. Azevedo J.E. Carmo-Fonseca M. de Sousa M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3612-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This specific ER stress response enhances the levels of molecular chaperones involved in protein folding and degradation and reduces the rate of protein synthesis (9Schroder M. Kaufman R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar). Upon UPR activation, activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), an ER stress-transducing protein, is cleaved (nATF6) and relocates to the nucleus where it promotes expression of UPR-responsive genes (10Haze K. Yoshida H. Yanagi H. Yura T. Mori K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3787-3799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1552) Google Scholar, 11Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 99-111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). Another active transcription factor that promotes transcription of UPR-responsive genes is produced by the alternative splicing of X box-binding protein-1 (sXBP1) (12Yoshida H. Matsui T. Yamamoto A. Okada T. Mori K. Cell. 2001; 107: 881-891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2982) Google Scholar). Our goal in this study is to investigate the effect of the chemical chaperones tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) and sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) in the HFE C282Y-associated UPR as well as the impact of these compounds on the intracellular trafficking and localization of the HFE mutant protein. We show that chemical enhancement of the ER folding capacity results in the prevention of the UPR activation and influences the degradation of HFE C282Y. In addition, investigation of the subcellular localization of HFE C282Y revealed that this misfolded protein forms aggregates and that 4PBA is effective in preventing their formation. These findings offer a potential new strategy for therapy designed to prevent the potential toxicity of the intracellular aggregates.

Western blot was then performed using anti-HA mAb. The position of the Endo H-resistant (+CHO) and -sensitive (-CHO) forms of HFE is indicated. The asterisk indicates the position of a nonspecific band. One representative experiment of three performed with similar results is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cells-Human embryonic kidney 293T cells (HEK 293T) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in DMEM with GlutaMAX medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin solution (Sigma) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. Transfections-293T cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) in 60-mm plates accordingly to the manufacturer's protocol. At the time of transfection, cells were 90-95% confluent. Opti-MEM was used to dilute both DNA and Lipofectamine at a final DNA/Lipofectamine ratio of 1:2.5. After transfection cells were incubated for 48 h in DMEM with GlutaMAX medium (Invitrogen) containing 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin solution (Sigma) and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. In these studies a plasmid encoding β2-microglobulin was co-transfected with HFE expression vectors to ensure that sufficient quantity of this protein was available for correct assembly of the HFE. Pulse-Chase-48 h after transfection, 1 × 107 293T cells were starved for 1 h in cysteine/methionine-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 1% l-glutamine and pulsed for 20 min with 140 μCi/ml Pro-Mix l-[35S]cysteine/methionine (Amersham Biosciences). The culture medium was then supplemented with cold cysteine and methionine and chased for the indicated times. At each time point 1 aliquot was taken, washed, and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (300 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X, Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), 10 mm iodoacetamide). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and the lysates were precleared with 100 μl of protein A-Sepharose bead slurry (50%) for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-HA. Immunocomplexes were pulled down with protein A-Sepharose beads and washed three times in ice-cold lysis buffer. After addition of gel loading buffer solution (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min, samples were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE and Quantitation-10% SDS-PAGE was performed using a Bio-Rad Mini Protean II kit. Gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, incubated for 30 min with Amplify solution (Amersham Biosciences), dried, and exposed to a radioactivity storage screen. Quantitation was performed using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare) with ImageQuant version 5.1 software. Western Blot, Endo H Digestion, and Ultracentrifugation-Protein concentration in whole cell lysates was determined with RC/DC protein assay (Bio-Rad), and 30 μg were separated by SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences). After blocking at 4 °C with 5% dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS (TBS-T), the membrane was incubated with anti-HA or anti-KDEL, washed three times with TBS-T, and detected with the respective horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and an enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce). To control loadings, the membrane was stripped using Restore WB Stripping Buffer (Pierce) and incubated with anti-β-actin. For the Endo H assay, whole cell lysates were digested for 4 h at 37°C with Endo H (Roche Diagnostics) or glycosidase F (Roche Diagnostics) as described by the manufacturer. The reaction was stopped by addition of gel loading buffer solution (GLB) (16Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207227) Google Scholar) with 10% β-mercaptoethanol and boiling for 5 min. For detection of protein aggregates, cells were solubilized in 1% Triton X lysis buffer for 1 h on ice. After a centrifugation step at 300 × g for 5 min to clear cell debris, whole cell lysates were split into 2 equal portions. One represented the total protein content, and the other was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C in a Sorvall Ultra Pro80 centrifuge. The pellet fraction and the protein content of the supernatant fraction (obtained by a 10% trichloroacetic acid precipitation) were solubilized with GLB, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and boiling for 5 min. Equivalent gel loading was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose membrane with 0.1% Ponceau S. Treatment with Chemical Chaperones-18 h post-transfection, 293T cells were washed and incubated for 30 h in DMEM with GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin/amphotericin solution and 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 1 mm TUDCA (Calbiochem) or 5 mm 4PBA (Sigma). The percentage of transfected cells was not affected by the treatment with the chemical chaperones (data not shown). Real Time PCR-Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following treatment with 2 units/sample of RQ1 DNase, in the presence of 50 units/sample of RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), for 30 min at 37 °C, 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed, using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer's instructions. Expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real time PCR with the ABI PRISM 7700 instrument (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using 1× SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantification of β-actin gene expression was performed as a control. Relative expression levels were calculated as 2[caret](Ct human β-actin - Ct HLA-A × 10,000) (for details see ABI PRISM 7700, User Bulletin 2). The oligonucleotides used were 5′-CTCCTTTGGTGAAGGTGACACATC-3′ and 5′-ATCACAATGAGGGGCTGATCC-3′ for HFE and 5′-CCTGGGTGGCGGAACCTTCGATGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGGACGGGCTTCATAGTAGACCGG-3′ for BiP. Flow Cytometry-293T cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged HFE WT or C282Y were washed in ice-cold PBS, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3 followed by incubation at 4 °C with a saturating amount of primary Ab for 30 min in 96-well plates. After three washes cells were incubated with Cy3-conjugated secondary Ab for 30 min on ice without permeabilization. Cells were washed, and flow cytometry analysis was performed in a FACS-Calibur (BD Biosciences). The Cy3 fluorescence, representing cell surface expression of HFE, was measured in GFP-positive cells. For each sample a minimum of 15,000 events were acquired. To define the background staining, irrelevant mAbs of the same isotype were used. Fluorescence Microscopy-HFE WT-GFP or HFE C282Y-GFP transiently transfected 293T cells were grown on coverslips and either left untreated or treated with 1 mm TUDCA or 5 mm 4PBA for 30 h. Cells were rinsed three times in PBS, fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde, and simultaneously blocked and permeabilized with 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS, for 30 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were incubated for 30 min with anti-KDEL, washed twice with PBS, and incubated with anti-mouse Cy3-conjugated Ab. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides in 1:5 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (10 μg/ml; Sigma):Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), and immunofluorescence analysis was performed on a Axiovert Carl Zeiss microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). For quantification of cells containing HFE aggregates, at least 200 cells were counted according to an unbiased systematic random sampling scheme. Statistical Analysis-To test the significance of the differences observed, the Student's t test was used. In all tests the statistical significance was two-sided and considered at p < 0.05. Data are displayed as mean ± 1 S.D. Modulation of the UPR Interferes with HFE C282Y Stability-Previous studies have shown that HFE C282Y fails to travel beyond the ER and is subjected to accelerated proteasomal degradation in COS7 cells (3Waheed A. Parkkila S. Zhou X.Y. Tomatsu S. Tsuchihashi Z. Feder J.N. Schatzman R.C. Britton R.S. Bacon B.R. Sly W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12384-12389Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Pulse-chase analysis performed in 293T cells confirmed these observations specifically in our transfected cell model system (Fig. 1A). In 293T cells overexpressing HFE WT or C282Y, only the WT protein can reach the cell surface as observed by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. 1A) and by the HFE WT resistance to Endo H digestion (supplemental Fig. 1B). In contrast, no Endo H-resistant protein is observed in HFE C282Y-transfected cells, confirming that the mutant protein is unable to leave the ER through the standard secretory pathway (supplemental Fig. 1B). We have recently shown that the ER-retained HFE C282Y mutant protein leads to the activation of the UPR (8de Almeida S.F. Fleming J.V. Azevedo J.E. Carmo-Fonseca M. de Sousa M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 3612-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To investigate the involvement of the ER stress pathway on the protein stability of HFE, 293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding HFE WT or C282Y, and the UPR was genetically modulated by the co-expression of transcriptionally active isoforms of either ATF6 (nATF6) or XBP1 (sXBP1). Induction of the UPR was confirmed by analysis of GRP94 and BiP levels by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 1C). Stimulation of the UPR by either sXBP1 or nATF6 resulted in highly significant decreases in steady state expression of the HFE C282Y protein compared with HFE WT (Fig. 1B). Chemical Chaperones Block the UPR Activation and Alter the HFE C282Y Stability-To evaluate the effect of chemical chaperones on the ER stress response, HFE WT- or C282Y-expressing cells were cultured in the presence of TUDCA and 4PBA. Using BiP and GRP94 levels as markers for the UPR activation, we observed that HFE C282Y-transfected cells treated with chemical chaperones have lower levels of both proteins indicating that these compounds were effective in inhibiting the activation of the UPR in HFE C282Y-expressing cells (Fig. 2A). As an independent measure of UPR activation, real time PCR was performed to quantify BiP expression at the transcriptional level. Although no significant effect was observed in HFE WT-transfected cells, analysis of the data showed a statistically significant decrease in BiP mRNA in HFE C282Y-transfected cells cultured in the presence of TUDCA or 4PBA when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 2B). The efficiency of chemical chaperones was further confirmed by the capacity of TUDCA to alleviate ER stress in cells co-expressing HFE C282Y plus nATF6 or sXBP1 (Fig. 2C). By having shown in Fig. 1 that stimulation of the UPR lowers the levels of HFE C282Y, treatment with chemical chaperones should rescue the mutant protein from degradation. Indeed, we observed increased levels of this protein in HFE C282Y-transfected cells when TUDCA was present in the culture medium (Fig. 2D, right-hand side blot, 2nd versus 3rd lane). However, treatment with 4PBA did not result in the stabilization of the HFE C282Y protein. In the presence of this chemical chaperone, the amount of protein detected was smaller than that observed in untreated cells (Fig. 2D, righthand side blot, 2nd versus 4th lane). HFE WT transfection did not result in the UPR activation (Fig. 2A). Neither TUDCA nor 4PBA had a significant effect on steady state expression of BiP, GRP94 (Fig. 2A), and HFE WT (Fig. 2D, left-hand side blot). To exclude a possible effect of the chemical chaperones on the transcription efficiency of HFE, mRNA from TUDCA or 4PBA-treated and -untreated cells was quantified by real time PCR. Fig. 3 shows that no significant differences were observed in the HFE mRNA levels, corroborating the hypothesis that 4PBA facilitates HFE C282Y degradation. Chemical Chaperones Do Not Restore HFE C282Y Cell Surface Expression-Several examples of mutant proteins whose folding defects are corrected by the action of chemical chaperones have already been described (5Welch W.J. Brown C.R. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1996; 1: 109-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). As the C282Y mutation impairs the correct assembly of HFE molecules and concomitantly their trafficking beyond the ER toward the cell surface, we wanted to investigate if treatment with TUDCA or 4PBA promoted the stabilization of a conformation that restores HFE C282Y cell surface expression. To do that, 293T cells transiently expressing HFE WT-GFP or HFE C282Y-GFP were cultured in the presence or absence of TUDCA or 4PBA. Cell surface expression of HFE was then evaluated by flow cytometry analysis of the anti-HFE staining in GFP-positive cells (cells successfully transfected with HFE WT or HFE C282Y). The results revealed that treatment with the chemical chaperones had no effect on the correct cell surface expression of HFE WT when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 4A). Regarding the effect of TUDCA and 4PBA on HFE C282Y, this set of experiments revealed that none of the chemical chaperones used was able to restore the cell surface expression of the mutant protein (Fig. 4A). The failure of these compounds to promote the correct intracellular trafficking of HFE C282Y was further confirmed by the results obtained with Endo H. Following digestion with this glycosidase, analysis of protein extracts of cells expressing HFE C282Y and cultured in the presence or absence of TUDCA or 4PBA did not reveal any Endo H-resistant HFE protein, as observed by the conversion of all the protein to a deglycosylated (HFE-CHO) state with higher electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4B, 1st versus 2nd to 4th lanes). These data strongly suggest that chemical chaperones cannot overcome HFE C282Y ER retention. 4PBA Prevents HFE C282Y Aggregation-To investigate the intracellular localization of the HFE C282Y protein, 293T cells expressing either HFE WT-GFP or HFE C282Y-GFP were stained with anti-KDEL Ab and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy.

https://openalex.org/W2148770445,"P2X receptors are membrane ion channels gated by extracellular ATP that are found widely in vertebrates, but not previously in microbes. Here we identify a weakly related gene in the genome of the social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum, and show, with the use of heterologous expression in human embryonic kidney cells, that it encodes a membrane ion channel activated by ATP (30-100 muM). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed essential conservation of structure-function relations with P2X receptors of higher organisms. The receptor was insensitive to the usual P2X antagonists but was blocked by nanomolar concentrations of Cu2+ ions. In D. discoideum, the receptor was found on intracellular membranes, with prominent localization to an osmoregulatory organelle, the contractile vacuole. Targeted disruption of the gene in D. discoideum resulted in cells that were unable to regulate cell volume in hypotonic conditions. Cell swelling in these mutant cells was accompanied by a marked inhibition of contractile vacuole emptying. These findings demonstrate a new functional role for P2X receptors on intracellular organelles, in this case in osmoregulation."

The phytoalexin resveratrol (RV) is known to possess a variety of cancer-preventive, -therapeutic, and -chemosensitizing properties. We report here that chronic treatment with RV in a subapoptotic concentration induces senescence-like growth arrest in tumor cells. In contrast to the widely accepted antioxidant property of RV, we demonstrate that one causative stimulus for senescence induction by chronic RV is an increased level of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS formed upon RV exposure include hydrogen peroxide and superoxide and originate largely from mitochondria. Consistently, co-incubation with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine interfered with RV-mediated reactivation of the senescence program. Molecular mediators on the way from increased ROS levels to the observed growth arrest include p38 MAPK, p53, and p21. Moreover, we provide evidence that RV-initiated replication stress, apparent by activation of the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase pathway, is associated with increased ROS levels and senescence induction.

After an inherent number of cell divisions, the so-called Hayflick number, they enter the state of senescence, an irreversible proliferation arrest despite intact metabolic activity (1Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4287) Google Scholar). There are several forms and triggers of senescence. Replicative senescence is caused by redox stress and/or telomere erosion below a certain threshold (2Furumoto K. Inoue E. Nagao N. Hiyama E. Miwa N.

Its anti-proliferative actions in a variety of cell systems are primarily explained by a reversible delay or an irreversible arrest of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle (25Haider U.G. Sorescu D.

Notably, one study found the DNA checkpoint pathways including ATM/ATR (ATM and Rad3-related) and Chk1 kinases to be activated by RV (26Tyagi A. Singh R.P. Agarwal C. Siriwardana S. Sclafani R.A. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1978-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Outgoing from these data, we asked whether RV can trigger reactivation of senescence in cancer cells, and if so, whether reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or activation of ATM are involved. In the course of our studies, we observed that RV, chronically administered in a subapoptotic concentration, caused a senescence-like growth arrest in HCT 116 colon carcinoma (and other cancer) cells that was partially reliant on ROS-dependent activation of p38 MAPK, p53, and the induction of p21. Moreover, we gained evidence that also activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM contributes to the reactivation of senescence in cancer cells upon RV exposure and that there is an interdependence between redox and cell cycle effects of RV.

Confluent cells were passaged, and population doublings were determined according to PD = log N (t) – log (N(to))/log 2, where N(t) is the number of cells per well at time of passage, and N(to) is the number of cells seeded at the previous passage. The sum of PDs was then plotted against time of culture. SA-β-gal Staining—Senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining was performed as described previously (29Dimri G.P. Lee X. Basile G. Acosta M. Scott G. Roskelley C. Medrano E.E. Linskens M. Rubelj I. Pereira-Smith O. Peacocke M. Campisi J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9363-9367Crossref PubMed Scopus (5738) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—After the indicated treatment, cells were lysed and subjected to PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (25Haider U.G. Sorescu D. Griendling K.K. Vollmar A.M. Dirsch V.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 925-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Blots were analyzed by a CCD camera (Fuji LAS 3000), and densitometry was performed employing AIDA image analyzer 4.06 software (raytest). Flow-cytometric Methods for Determination of Total ROS and Superoxide—For determination of total ROS levels, cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated as indicated. Cells were then washed once with 0.2% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 20 μm 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCF-DA) (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen), which is cleaved by intracellular esterases and transformed to a fluorescent dye when oxidized at 37 °C for 30 min prior to immediate analysis by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences). The mean fluorescence of 10,000 analyzed cells (corrected for autofluorescence) of each treatment group was taken as a measure for the total ROS load. For determination of superoxide levels, cells were grown in 6-well plates, treated as indicated, and exposed to 20 ng/ml dihydroethidium, a dye specifically oxidized by superoxide, in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin for the last hour of incubation. After a wash in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, cells were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). The mean fluorescence of each treatment group (corrected for autofluorescence) was taken as a measure of cellular superoxide levels. Determination of H2O2 Levels—Extracellular H2O2 levels were determined with the Amplex Red assay (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions and normalized to the analyzed number of cells. Determination of the Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (MMP)—MMP was analyzed by employing the dye JC-1 (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) that accumulates in the mitochondria and emits fluorescence in a potential sensitive manner. We calculated the MMP as ratio between red- and green-positive cells (590/527 nm ratio, using a Genios Pro, TECAN, fluorescence reader), comparing Me2SO control with cells treated with RV for the indicated periods of time. Statistical Analysis—All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. One-way analysis of variance with Dunnett's multiple comparison test was used to reveal significant differences between control and treatment groups. Differences with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Analyses of the data were performed using the software GraphPad PRISM, Version 4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Resveratrol Induces a Senescence-like Growth Arrest in Cancer Cells—To assess a potential pro-senescent activity of RV, we cultivated WT HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells in the presence of different concentrations (1–100 μm) of RV and determined population doublings over time. Although 0–10 μm RV did not affect proliferation rate of HCT 116 cells, 100 μm induced rapid cell death. 30 μm RV slowed down proliferation until cells finally came to a complete growth stop after 30–40 days of treatment (Fig. 1A). The chronic (repetitive) administration of 30 μm RV did not elicit any obvious signs of apoptosis (absence of floating cells or DNA fragmentation throughout the duration of the experiment; data not shown). Cells that were growth-arrested for at least 10 days were stained for SA-β-gal expression and showed up to 60% positive staining, indicating that 30 μm RV induces a senescent phenotype in HCT 116 colon carcinoma cells (Fig. 1B). RV (30 μm)-treated cells displayed a flattened and enlarged morphology and an abrogated bromodeoxyuridine-labeling index (<5%) (data not shown). Moreover, RV growth-arrested cells showed a decreased response to growth factors (Fig. 1C); control cells (no RV treatment) and RV growth-arrested HCT cells were serum-starved for 16 h and stimulated with EGF for 5 min. pERK activation was taken as readout for growth factor responsiveness. Although control cells showed a prominent activation of ERK, chronically RV-treated cells failed to activate ERK upon EGF stimulation. In contrast, short term treatment of RV did not negatively interfere with EGF-mediated mitogenic signaling. These results indicate that repetitive treatment with 30 μm RV over time can trigger senescence-like growth arrest in HCT 116 cells. To rule out that the pro-senescent effect of RV is restricted to HCT 116 cells, we chronically treated the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 as well as the epidermoid carcinoma cell line A431 with the appropriate subapoptotic concentration of RV. We observed growth retardation and subsequent proliferation stop as well as SA-β-gal expression in both RV-exposed cell lines, suggesting a general and not tumor cell type-specific pro-senescent effect of RV (supplemental Fig. 1). Induction of Senescence-like Growth Arrest by RV Is Dependent on p53 and p21—Since p53 and p21 were described to be major players in the induction of senescence, we investigated whether these proteins are also involved in RV-mediated growth arrest. For this, we cultivated a p53 or a p21 knock-out HCT cell line (knock-out status confirmed by immunoblotting, supplemental Fig. 2A) that was isogenic to WT clones and of comparable passage number, in the presence of RV as described for the WT. Both HCT knock-out cell clones displayed a similar growth retardation/arrest profile when compared with the WT (supplemental Fig. 2B). However, staining for SA-β-gal expression revealed a significantly lower percentage of positive cells in the knock-out lines (Fig. 2A). For unknown reasons, the p53 clones of the HCT line displayed an overall weaker expression of SA-β-gal (up to 60% positive cells in p21 WT versus up to 25% cells in p53 WT cells after the same RV treatment protocol). Furthermore, the growth arrest in p53 and p21 knock-out cells was reversible after withdrawal of RV, whereas halted WT cells were not able to resume proliferation upon RV removal (supplemental Fig. 2C). These data suggest that p53 and p21 are essential mediators for maintenance of an irreversible senescence-like growth arrest triggered by RV. In addition, there is a minor, but reproducible, p53/p21-independent senescence induction by RV that will not further be discussed in the following sections. To exclude HCT 116-specific effects of RV, we also included the p53-negative breast carcinoma cell line MDA-MB 231. Continuous treatment with RV led to a growth arrest that was not accompanied by a significant increase of SA-β-gal staining (in contrast to the p53-positive MCF-7 line) underlining the importance of a functional p53 for senescence induction by RV (supplemental Fig. 2D). Resveratrol Triggers Senescence by an Increase of Mitochondrial ROS Levels, Subsequent Activation of p38 MAPK, p53, and Induction of p21—Since p21 is one of the most prominent downstream targets of p53, and since p53 as well as p21 appeared to be crucial for RV-mediated irreversible growth arrest, we tested whether RV induces p21 in a p53-dependent manner. For this, we examined p21 levels in WT and p53 knock-out HCT 116 cells upon RV treatment. 30 μm RV led to an increase of p21 levels in WT cells as early as 48–72 h after treatment, which could not be observed in the p53 knock-out cells (Fig. 2B), indicating that RV induces p21-mediated senescence-like growth arrest in a p53-dependent manner. Consistently with this hypothesis, 30 μm RV was found to induce phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 without changing total levels of p53 (Fig. 2C). Next we addressed the underlying mechanism by which RV activates p53. p53 is known to be a transcription factor highly responsive to changes in the cellular redox state, and RV has been reported to exert both pro-oxidant and antioxidant effects (24Murias M. Jager W. Handler N. Erker T. Horvath Z. Szekeres T. Nohl H. Gille L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Moreover, redox stress has been implicated in the onset of cellular senescence. We therefore examined whether repetitive treatment with RV could elicit chronic redox changes in HCT cells. Employing the redox-sensitive fluorescent dye H2DCF-DA (detecting all intracellular ROS, namely H2O2, superoxide, and peroxynitrite) and subsequent flow cytometric analysis, we observed a time-dependent increase of total ROS with a significant elevation as early as 12 h after RV exposure (Fig. 3A) that lasted up to 48 h after a single pulse of 30 μm RV. The rise in intracellular ROS load did not require p53 nor p21 since both knock-out clones responded in a comparable fashion to RV exposure (data not shown). To rule out a mere accidental coincidence of ROS accumulation and senescence induction by RV, we employed the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We observed that coincubation with 10 mm NAC was able to significantly suppress the number of senescent cells that occurred after a long term incubation with RV (Fig. 3B). We furthermore showed that NAC interfered with RV-triggered p53 phosphorylation (Ser-15) and p21 induction (Fig. 3, C and D). Consistent results were obtained with two additional antioxidants, namely 4 mm tempol, a superoxide scavenger, or 2000 units/ml polyethylene glycol-catalase (data not shown). We therefore conclude that elevated ROS levels contribute to senescence induction by RV. In accordance with the elevated ROS levels, the redox-sensitive protein kinase MAPK-p38 was found to be significantly hyperphosphorylated 24 h after treatment with RV without changes in its total levels. This effect could be overcome by preincubation of cells with 10 mm NAC (Fig. 3E), suggesting that activation of p38 MAPK by RV depends on elevation of ROS. p38 MAPK has been reported to be a positive regulator of senescence (30Ito K. Hirao A. Arai F. Takubo K. Matsuoka S. Miyamoto K. Ohmura M. Naka K. Hosokawa K. Ikeda Y. Suda T. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 446-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar, 31Kuki S. Imanishi T. Kobayashi K. Matsuo Y. Obana M. Akasaka T. Circ. J. 2006; 70: 1076-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Probin V. Wang Y. Bai A. Zhou D. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2006; 319: 551-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We could observe that p38 also contributes to activation of p53 and p21 induction in our system since the p38-specific inhibitor SB 203580 overcame the RV-triggered induction of p21 (Fig. 3F, upper panel). SB 203580 interfered with RV-mediated p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 3F, lower panel), although to a lesser extent than with p21 induction, which implies a p53-independent induction of p21 downstream of p38 (33Moon S.K. Choi Y.H. Kim C.H. Choi W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 662-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). We conclude that RV can induce senescence-like growth arrest in p53-positive cancer cells, at least partly, by the sequel: RV → increase of ROS → activation of p53 (via MAPK-p38) → the induction of p21 → growth arrest. RV-triggered ROS Include Superoxide and Hydrogen Peroxide and Originate from Mitochondria—Since ROS turned out to be one major trigger for RV-induced senescence, we next aimed to elucidate the nature and source of ROS produced upon RV exposure. Using dyes specific for H2O2 (Amplex Red) (Fig. 4A) and superoxide (dihydroethidium) (Fig. 4B), respectively, we observed an increase in both H2O2 and superoxide in HCT cells after 24 h with RV. Preincubation of the cells with the superoxide scavenger tempol (4 mm) substantially reduced both the RV-mediated increase of dihydroethidium fluorescence and the Amplex Red signal, suggesting that RV-induced H2O2 levels are directly derived from superoxide. To investigate the source of ROS upon RV treatment, we employed the following inhibitors: diphenyliodonium (inhibitor of all flavoproteins including NAD(P)H-dependent oxygenases (NOXes), nitric oxide synthases (NOSes), and mitochondrial respiratory complexes), apocynin (selective inhibitor of NOXes), l-NG-nitro-l-aginine-methylester (NOS inhibitor), allopurinol (xanthine oxidase inhibitor), mitoQ (targeted mitochondrial antioxidant) decyl-TPP (negative control for mitoQ to exclude effects due to mere mitochondrial accumulation), and AA861 (selective inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase) (Fig. 4C). Since mitoQ and diphenyliodonium next to the general antioxidants NAC and catalase but not selective NOX, NOS, xanthine oxidase, nor 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors were able to significantly overcome RV-mediated ROS production, we conclude that mitochondria are the main source of ROS during RV treatment in our setup. Consistently, we were also able to observe a decrease in the MMP upon RV exposure (Fig. 4D). Consistent results were obtained in the breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 (supplemental Fig. 3). Activation of the DNA Damage Checkpoint Kinase ATM Contributes to Senescence Induction by RV and Is Associated with Elevation of ROS—After having defined a role for ROS, we next focused on the potential contribution of ATM kinase to senescence induction by RV. During the cultivation of cancer cells in the presence of RV (Fig. 1A), we observed a retarded growth rate until the cells finally entered senescence-like growth arrest. We observed that 30 μm RV hereby induced a transient retardation of cells in S-phase that is accompanied by foci of phosphorylated γ-histone 2AX as well as an activation of ATM/Chk1(but not Chk2)/cdc2 pathway (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). This agrees with the report of Tyagi et al. (26Tyagi A. Singh R.P. Agarwal C. Siriwardana S. Sclafani R.A. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1978-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) in ovarian cancer cells and suggests the occurrence of DNA damage or replication stress (34Tanaka T. Halicka H.D. Huang X. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1940-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) upon RV exposure. To decipher the role of ATM kinase activity for senescence reactivation by RV, we employed two ATM inhibitors, namely caffeine (5 mm) and KU 55993 (10 μm). We could demonstrate that both inhibitors overcame RV-triggered p53 phosphorylation (Ser-15) and p21 induction (Fig. 5A). Moreover, long term incubation with RV and KU55993 was able to significantly lower the number of senescent (SA-β-gal-positive) cells when compared with RV alone (Fig. 5B). These findings indicate that activation of ATM contributes to senescence induction by RV. We next were interested in whether there is an association between elevated ROS and replication stress in RV-treated cells. For this, we explored (a) the influence of the antioxidant NAC on ATM activation and signaling and (b) the influence of KU 55993 and caffeine on ROS levels. 10 mm NAC was able to reduce ATM activity measured by Chk-1 phosphorylation, suggesting that ROS are implied in RV-mediated replication stress (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, inhibition of ATM kinase activity by caffeine or KU55993 was capable of reducing the elevation of ROS upon RV exposure, indicating that replication stress vice versa influences ROS production (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that the RV-mediated effects on redox milieu and cell cycle progression are interconnected and that both contribute to the induction of senescence upon repetitive exposure to RV. Fig. 6 depicts our findings schematically. We showed that chronic administration of subapoptotic concentrations of RV induces senescence-like growth arrest in cancer cells. This process occurs to be dependent on p53 and p21. The potential causative trigger for senescence induction, apart from the already described inhibition of telomerase at high concentrations (35Fuggetta M.P. Lanzilli G. Tricarico M. Cottarelli A. Falchetti R. Ravagnan G. Bonmassar E. J. Exp. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 25: 189-193PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lanzilli G. Fuggetta M.P. Tricarico M. Cottarelli A. Serafino A. Falchetti R. Ravagnan G. Turriziani M. Adamo R. Franzese O. Bonmassar E. Int. J. Oncol. 2006; 28: 641-648PubMed Google Scholar), could be confined to chronically increased ROS production as well as activation of the DNA damage checkpoint kinase ATM upon RV exposure. The source of RV-induced elevation of ROS, including H2O2 and superoxide, could be largely assigned to mitochondria in our system. Moreover, we observed mutual cross-talk between increased ROS levels and activation of ATM after RV exposure. This is to the best of our knowledge the first report that investigates the long term effects of RV on cancer cells, reveals ROS as a major signaling intermediate in the action of RV, and hereby elucidates causal interrelationships between so far seemingly isolated actions of RV, namely redox activity, cell cycle effects, and putative anti-cancer activity including the novel pro-senescent effect. Elevated ROS levels have been widely accepted as a causative trigger for senescence-like growth arrest (2Furumoto K. Inoue E. Nagao N. Hiyama E. Miwa N. Life Sci. 1998; 63: 935-948Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 3Passos J.F. Von Zglinicki T. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 1277-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and have here been demonstrated to be involved in senescence induction by RV. RV has so far been mostly described as an antioxidant. A potential explanation for this apparent contradiction may lie in the readouts used. When looking at the induction of antioxidant defense enzymes such as manganese superoxide dismutase or glutathione S-transferase (22Li Y. Cao Z. Zhu H. Pharmacol. Res. 2006; 53: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 37Sengottuvelan M. Senthilkumar R. Nalini N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1760: 1175-1183Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), RV may appear as an antioxidant since intracellular ROS, possibly caused by RV itself, could trigger these antioxidant defense reactions. Moreover, different time frames employed for the studies can explain the divergent outcomes. RV may, due to its polyphenolic structure, act as a radical scavenging antioxidant (24Murias M. Jager W. Handler N. Erker T. Horvath Z. Szekeres T. Nohl H. Gille L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2005; 69: 903-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) during the initial phase of exposure. The observed pro-oxidant effect in our study was measurable starting at 12 h after exposure to RV. From our data using specific inhibitors for mitochondrial ROS, NOXes, NOSes, xanthine oxidase, and 5-lipoxygenase, respectively, we conclude that mitochondria are one major source of RV-triggered superoxide and H2O2 production. Mitochondria have recently been described as the primary target of RV for apoptosis induction (38Sareen D. van Ginkel P.R. Takach J.C. Mohiuddin A. Darjatmoko S.R. Albert D.M. Polans A.S. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 3708-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One might thus think of mitochondrial ROS as one of the main signaling intermediates after RV exposure leading to senescence or apoptosis, respectively, depending on cell type, concentration, and incubation time of RV. Additional sources of RV-mediated ROS, such as down-regulation of the cellular antioxidant defense enzymes, cannot be excluded at this point and deserve further investigation, especially as the period of 12 h before the first pro-oxidative signal after RV treatment could allow de novo synthesis or degradation of cellular redox regulators. Prior to undergoing the irreversible growth arrest, RV-treated cells are retarded in their proliferation rate. They hereby were transiently arrested in S-phase of the cell cycle accompanied by activation of the ATM pathway and phosphorylation/inactivation of cdc2 (26Tyagi A. Singh R.P. Agarwal C. Siriwardana S. Sclafani R.A. Agarwal R. Carcinogenesis. 2005; 26: 1978-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 3C). Employing ATM inhibitors, we could demonstrate that ATM kinase contributes to RV-induced senescence, stressing the pro-senescent effect of the DNA damage response pathway (7d'Adda di Fagagna F. Reaper P.M. Clay-Farrace L. Fiegler H. Carr P. Von Zglinicki T. Saretzki G. Carter N.P. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2003; 426: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2054) Google Scholar, 8Di Leonardo A. Linke S.P. Clarkin K. Wahl G.M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2540-2551Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar, 13Mallette F.A. Gaumont-Leclerc M.F. Ferbeyre G. Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). ATM kinase therefore appears as a suitable target for pharmacological intervention in the context of senescence (39Won J. Kim M. Kim N. Ahn J.H. Lee W.G. Kim S.S. Chang K.Y. Yi Y.W. Kim T.K. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 369-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The tumor suppressor p53 turned out to be an essential downstream mediator and integrator between ROS or ATM and senescence-like growth arrest in RV-treated tumor cells. RV induces p21 expression and subsequent growth arrest by phosphorylation of p53 at serine 15 via activation of both ATM and p38 kinases. RV-mediated effects on other phosphorylation or acetylation sites of p53 cannot be excluded and need further investigation. The same applies for the role of Rb in RV-induced senescence. Since HCT 116 cells lack a functional p16 due to promoter methylation and RV could not be shown to change p16 expression in our cells, RV-triggered senescence induction appears to occur independently of p16 (40Myohanen S.K. Baylin S.B. Herman J.G. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 591-593PubMed Google Scholar). We further observed a positive and mutual feedback between ATM activation and increased ROS levels upon RV exposure (Fig. 5). Our data are compatible with reports that indicate an association of replication stress in S-phase with subsequently elevated ROS (41Takahashi Y. Ogra Y. Suzuki K.T. Life Sci. 2004; 75: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 42Havens C.G. Ho A. Yoshioka N. Dowdy S.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4701-4711Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as well as studies that identify activation of ATM mainly as a response to oxidative stress and subsequent DNA damage (34Tanaka T. Halicka H.D. Huang X. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1940-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 43Tanaka T. Kajstura M. Halicka H.D. Traganos F. Darzynkiewicz Z. Cell Prolif. 2007; 40: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 44Das K.C. Dashnamoorthy R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: L87-L97Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The issue of how RV-triggered redox and replication stress exactly are temporally and causally related remains unresolved and warrants further investigation. In this context, it will be interesting to examine the possibility of oxidative DNA lesions upon RV exposure as done for the cancer chemopreventive compound epigallocatechin-gallate (45Furukawa A. Oikawa S. Murata M. Hiraku Y. Kawanishi S. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 66: 1769-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 46Elbling L. Weiss R.M. Teufelhofer O. Uhl M. Knasmueller S. Schulte-Hermann R. Berger W. Micksche M. FASEB. J. 2005; 19: 807-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or to unambiguously show RV-mediated inhibition of DNA polymerase or ribonucleotide reductase activity in vivo. Moreover, it is still unclear what immediate target RV is hitting to elicit its effects. Immediate binding partners and targets of RV that have been described include the histone deacetylase SirT1 (47Wood J.G. Rogina B. Lavu S. Howitz K. Helfand S.L. Tatar M. Sinclair D. Nature. 2004; 430: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) and the α3βV-integrin (48Lin H.Y. Lansing L. Merillon J.M. Davis F.B. Tang H.Y. Shih A. Vitrac X. Krisa S. Keating T. Cao H.J. Bergh J. Quackenbush S. Davis P.J. FASEB. J. 2006; 20: 1742-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, neither of them seems to be involved in the effects of RV that are reported here. In preliminary experiments, we employed the SirT1 inhibitors sirtinol and nicotinaminde as well as the integrin-blocking peptide RGD. None of them were able to abrogate replicative or oxidative stress responses upon RV exposure, although the integrin signalosome including NOXes and other redox-sensitive proteins as well as SirT1 influencing mitochondrial biosynthesis seemed promising candidates to explain the effects of RV. Overall, our studies add a novel facet to the cancer chemopreventive action of RV and set so far isolated actions of RV in a causal context. Chronically administered in a subapoptotic concentration, RV elicits redox and replication stress that both merge, via activation of ATM and p38 MAPK, into p53/p21-dependent senescent-like growth arrest in cancer cells. For a potential application of RV as a cancer chemopreventive agent or adjuvant in chemotherapy, however, thorough studies focusing on bioavailability, the half-life of RV and the efficacy of its metabolites are needed since senescence induction might require the continuous presence or regular pulses of the active principle in a sufficiently high concentration.

https://openalex.org/W2078613709,"Stereotyped synaptic connectivity can arise both by precise recognition between appropriate partners during synaptogenesis and by selective synapse elimination. The molecular mechanisms that underlie selective synapse removal are largely unknown. We found that stereotyped developmental elimination of synapses in the Caenorhabditis elegans hermaphrodite-specific motor neuron (HSNL) was mediated by an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) complex composed of SKR-1 and the F-box protein SEL-10. SYG-1, a synaptic adhesion molecule, bound to SKR-1 and inhibited assembly of the SCF complex, thereby protecting nearby synapses. Thus, subcellular regulation of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation contributes to precise synaptic connectivity through selective synapse elimination."

We describe facile room-temperature protolytic cleavage by a thiol of the Hg-C bond in mercury-alkyl compounds that emulate the structure and function of the organomercurial lyase MerB. Specifically, the tris(2-mercapto-1-t-butylimidazolyl)hydroborato ligand [Tm(Bu(t))], which features three sulfur donors, has been used to synthesize [Tm(Bu(t))]HgR alkyl compounds (R = methyl or ethyl) that react with phenylthiol (PhSH) to yield [Tm(Bu(t))]HgSPh and RH. Although [Tm(Bu(t))]HgR compounds exist as linear two-coordinate complexes in the solid state, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicates that the complexes exist in rapid equilibrium with their higher-coordinate [kappa2-Tm(Bu(t))]HgR and [kappa3-Tm(Bu(t))]HgR isomers in solution. Facile access to a higher-coordinate species is proposed to account for the exceptional reactivity of [Tm(Bu(t))]HgR relative to that of other two-coordinate mercury-alkyl compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2073691357,"Angiogenesis is indispensable during fracture repair, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical in this process. CCN1 (CYR61) is an extracellular matrix signaling molecule that has been implicated in neovascularization through its interactions with several endothelial integrin receptors. CCN1 has been shown to be up-regulated during the reparative phase of fracture healing; however, the role of CCN1 therein remains unclear. Here, the regulation of CCN1 expression in osteoblasts and the functional consequences thereof were studied. Stimulation of osteoblasts with VEGF resulted in a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of CCN1 mRNA and protein. An up-regulation of both cell surface-associated CCN1 as well as extracellular matrix-associated CCN1 in osteoblasts was found. The supernatant of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts was chemotactic for endothelial cells, increasing their migration and stimulated capillary-like sprout formation. These effects could be attributed to the presence of CCN1 in the osteoblast supernatant as they were prevented by an antibody against CCN1 or by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of osteoblast CCN1. Moreover, the supernatant of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in vivo in a CCN1-dependent manner. In addition, blockade of CCN1 prevented bone fracture healing in mice. Taken together, the present work demonstrates a potential paracrine loop consisting of the VEGF-mediated up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts that attracts endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Such a loop could be operative during fracture healing. Angiogenesis is indispensable during fracture repair, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is critical in this process. CCN1 (CYR61) is an extracellular matrix signaling molecule that has been implicated in neovascularization through its interactions with several endothelial integrin receptors. CCN1 has been shown to be up-regulated during the reparative phase of fracture healing; however, the role of CCN1 therein remains unclear. Here, the regulation of CCN1 expression in osteoblasts and the functional consequences thereof were studied. Stimulation of osteoblasts with VEGF resulted in a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of CCN1 mRNA and protein. An up-regulation of both cell surface-associated CCN1 as well as extracellular matrix-associated CCN1 in osteoblasts was found. The supernatant of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts was chemotactic for endothelial cells, increasing their migration and stimulated capillary-like sprout formation. These effects could be attributed to the presence of CCN1 in the osteoblast supernatant as they were prevented by an antibody against CCN1 or by small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of osteoblast CCN1. Moreover, the supernatant of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts induced angiogenesis in Matrigel plugs in vivo in a CCN1-dependent manner. In addition, blockade of CCN1 prevented bone fracture healing in mice. Taken together, the present work demonstrates a potential paracrine loop consisting of the VEGF-mediated up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts that attracts endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis. Such a loop could be operative during fracture healing. Angiogenesis, the development of a microvascular network, is a strictly regulated process that is essential during embryonic development and healing mechanisms (1Carmeliet P. Nat. Med. 2003; 9: 653-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (3442) Google Scholar, 2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar). During bone growth, vascular structures invade the growth plate regions of the bone, providing a conduit for the entry of chondroclasts and osteoclasts that are involved in resorptive processes, whereas following bone injury, angiogenesis is transiently stimulated to promote repair mechanisms (3Winet H. Bone. 1996; 19: 39S-57SCrossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Gerber H-P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Olsen B.R. Reginato A.M. Wang W. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 191-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Fracture repair is a multistep process involving migration, proliferation, and differentiation of several cell types such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, chondroblasts, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts. Neovascularization in fracture repair is thought to be dependent on the functional cross-talk between bone-forming osteoblasts and endothelial cells within the bone microenvironment (6Mandracchia V.J. Nelson S.C. Barp E.A. Clin. Podiatr. Med. Surg. 2001; 18: 55-77PubMed Google Scholar). However, although it was recognized very early that osteoblasts and osteoprogenitor cells are often located adjacent to endothelial cells in blood vessels at sites of new bone formation (7Decker B. Bartels H. Decker S. Anat. Rec. 1995; 242: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Trueta J. Little K. J. Bone Jt. Surg. Br. 1960; 42: 367-376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Trueta J. J. Bone Jt. Surg. 1963; 45B: 402-418Crossref Google Scholar), it is not yet defined how osteoblasts may regulate angiogenesis-related endothelial cell functions. Among a variety of proangiogenic growth factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 3The abbreviations used are:VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorCTGFconnective tissue growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorTGFtransforming growth factorECMextracellular matrixsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 3The abbreviations used are:VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorCTGFconnective tissue growth factorPDGFplatelet-derived growth factorTGFtransforming growth factorECMextracellular matrixsiRNAsmall interfering RNAHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsPBSphosphate-buffered salineELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (2Risau W. Nature. 1997; 386: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (4805) Google Scholar) plays a pivotal role in bone remodeling and healing. VEGF is produced by many cells in the bone environment and stimulates the invasion of new blood vessels into the cartilage, thereby playing a crucial role in regulating resorption of cartilage and bone formation (10Gerber H-P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar). In the early stages of bone repair, large amounts of active VEGF are found in the fracture hematoma (11Street J. Winter D. Wang J.H. Wakai A. McGuiness A. Redmont H.P. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 2000; 378: 224-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). VEGF is involved in conversion of the soft, cartilaginous callus to a hard, bony callus during fracture repair (12Street J. Bao M. deGuzman L. Bunting S. Peale F.V. Ferrara N. Steinmetz H. Hoeffel J. Cleland J.L. Daugherty A. van Bruggen N. Redmont H.P. Carano R.A.D. Filvaroff E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9656-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). Furthermore, VEGF has chemotactic effects on osteoblasts and may directly enhance their activity in vitro (13Mayr-Wohlfart U. Waltenberger J. Hausser H. Kessler S. Gunther K.P. Dehio C. Puhl W. Brenner R.E. Bone. 2002; 30: 472-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) or may indirectly induce their proliferation and differentiation by stimulating endothelial cells to produce osteoanabolic growth factors (14Wang D.S. Miura M. Demura H. Sato K. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2953-2962Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). vascular endothelial growth factor connective tissue growth factor platelet-derived growth factor transforming growth factor extracellular matrix small interfering RNA human umbilical vein endothelial cells phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay vascular endothelial growth factor connective tissue growth factor platelet-derived growth factor transforming growth factor extracellular matrix small interfering RNA human umbilical vein endothelial cells phosphate-buffered saline enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Emerging evidence points to a role of the CCN (CYR61, CTGF, Nov) family, comprising six members in humans, in both angiogenesis and osteogenesis. These proteins are secreted, extracellular matrix (ECM)-associated proteins that regulate cell adhesion, migration, differentiation, and survival (15Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). CCN1 (CYR61) is a cysteine-rich, heparin-binding protein, associated with both the ECM and the cell surface (16Yang P.D. Lau F.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar), which acts as an atypical non-Arg-Gly-Asp-containing ligand of integrin receptors of the β1- and αv-family. In particular, CCN1 promotes endothelial cell migration, survival, and tubule formation in an αvβ3-integrin-dependent manner (17Leu S-J. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In addition to stimulating angiogenesis (18Babic A.M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6355-6360Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar), CCN1 is implicated in chondrogenesis (19O'Brien T.P. Lau L.F. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 645-654PubMed Google Scholar, 20Wong M. Kireeva M.L. Kolesnikova T.V. Lau L.F. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 492-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, CCN1 expression is increased in the callus and the newly formed osteoid during the reparative phase of fracture healing (21Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar); however, the role of CCN1 in this newly formed osteoid remains unclear. In particular, whether osteoblast-derived CCN1 may directly affect angiogenic functions of the endothelium has not been addressed yet. These observations prompted us to investigate how VEGF and CCN1 could act in concert to link osteoblast and endothelial cell functions in the context of bone angiogenesis. The present study demonstrates a potential paracrine loop consisting of the VEGF-mediated up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts that attracts vascular endothelial cells and promotes angiogenesis with potential implications in fracture healing. Reagents—The following reagents were provided from the following sources. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) AB, VEGF 165, transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β) were from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany); recombinant CCN1 protein was previously described (22Pendurthi U.R. Tran T.T. Post M. Rao L.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9705-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) as well as purchased from Abnova (Taipei, Taiwan). Rabbit polyclonal antibody against human CCN1 and control rabbit IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Heidelberg, Germany), whereas rabbit anti-CCN2 (connective tissue growth factor, CTGF) was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA), respectively. The polyclonal anti human CCN1 from rabbit was previously described (22Pendurthi U.R. Tran T.T. Post M. Rao L.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9705-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fibrinogen and fibronectin and antibody to human actin were from Sigma-Aldrich (Munich, Germany); blocking monoclonal antibody LM609 against αv-integrin and blocking monoclonal antibody against β1-integrin (6S6) were from Chemicon (Hofheim, Germany). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were from Promocell (Heidelberg, Germany) and cultured as described by the supplier. HUVEC were used in low passages (up to the fourth passage). Primary human osteoblastic cells were obtained from femoral bone biopsies of healthy adults (23Kasperk C. Helmboldt A. Börcsök I. Heuthe S. Cloos O. Niethard F. Ziegler R. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1997; 61: 464-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and cultivated as described previously (24Liegibel U.M. Sommer U. Tomakidi P. Hilscher U. van den Heuvel L. Pirzer R. Hillmeier J. Nawroth P. Kasperk C. J. Ex. Med. 2002; 196: 1387-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Generation of Osteoblast-conditioned Supernatant—Primary human osteoblastic cells were grown to confluency in 6-well plates, washed one time with PBS, and starved for 12 h in serum free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) low glucose (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). Cells were then washed and incubated for an additional 1 h in DMEM 0.2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, in the presence or absence of 20 ng/ml VEGF, after which the medium was again changed to DMEM 0.2% fetal calf serum. After 6 h, the supernatant was collected and used in cell migration and the in vitro angiogenesis assay. For in vivo angiogenesis, supernatant was concentrated using a 30-kDa cut-off Amicon ultracentrifugal filter device (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany). siRNA-mediated Knockdown of CCN1 in Osteoblasts—For transfections, a chemically synthesized duplex siRNA directed against human CCN1 or a non-targeting control siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago, IL) was engaged. siRNAs were transfected at a concentration of 100 nm using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), as described (25Orlova V.V. Economopoulou M. Lupu F. Santoso S. Chavakis T. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 2703-2714Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with VEGF, and the osteoblast-conditioned supernatants were collected as described above. CCN1 in the supernatants from non-transfected osteoblasts, from osteoblasts transfected with control siRNA, or from osteoblasts transfected with specific CCN1 siRNA was assessed by Western blot analysis. Extracellular Matrix Preparation of Osteoblasts—ECM preparation was performed according to our previously described protocol (26Chavakis T. Kanse S.M. Yutzy B. Lijnen H.R. Preissner K.T. Blood. 1998; 91: 2305-2312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, primary human osteoblasts were grown to confluency in 48-well plates and washed three times with PBS containing 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 1 mmol/liter CaCl2. Cells were removed with PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 15 min followed by incubation with 0.5% (w/v) Triton-X100 and 0.1 mol/liter NH3 for another 15 min at 22 °C. Finally, wells were washed with PBS and blocked with PBS containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Cell Migration Assay—Migration of endothelial cells was tested using Transwell membranes (8-μm pore size and 6.5-mm diameter) in 24-well plates (Corning Costar), as described previously (27Chavakis T. Cines D.B. Rhee J.S. Liang O.D. Schubert U. Hammes H.P. Higazi A.A. Nawroth P.P. Preissner K.T. Bdeir K. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1306-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The membranes were coated with fibrinogen or fibronectin (each at 10 μg/ml) in PBS for 16 h at 4 °C, washed, and air-dried before use. After gentle trypsinization, the cells were resuspended in DMEM containing 0.2% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and 100 μl of cell suspension at a density of 106/ml was added to the top chamber. Stimuli were added to the lower wells. Each treatment was performed in quadruplicates. After incubation of plates at 37 °C for 6 h, the number of migrated cells in the lower compartment was estimated with a cell counter (CASY counter, Schärfe System, Reutlingen, Germany). In Vitro Angiogenesis Assay—In vitro angiogenesis in fibrin gels was quantitated using endothelial cell spheroids as described previously (28Korff T. Augustin H.G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3249-3258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Athanasopoulos A.N. Economopoulou M. Orlova V.V. Sobke A. Schneider D. Weber H. Augustin H.G. Eming S.A. Schubert U. Linn T. Nawroth P.P. Hussain M. Hammes H.P. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T. Blood. 2006; 107: 2720-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, spheroids containing ∼750 cells were generated overnight, after which they were added to fibrin gels. Fibrin gels were prepared by mixing 750 μl of a solution containing 1.8 mg/ml fibrinogen in PBS with thrombin (0.65 units/ml). The spheroid-containing gel was allowed to polymerize for 30 min. Then, another 750 μlof serum-free medium with the corresponding test substance or supernatant from osteoblasts was added without or together with competitors, the plates were laid on top of the gel, and the spheroids were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity. Spheroids were evaluated microscopically, and sprout formation was expressed as sprouting spheroids/total spheroids. Matrigel Plug Assay—After thawing on ice, Matrigel (BD Biosciences) containing 30 IU/ml heparin (Liquemin, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), in the absence or presence of VEGF or recombinant CCN1 (100 ng/ml each), and supernatant from prestimulated or non-stimulated osteoblasts, without or with competitors, in a total volume of 400 μl was injected subcutaneously into the laterodorsal abdominal region of 8-week-old male C57Bl/6 mice. The Matrigel samples were recovered 5 days after implantation for photo documentation. To quantitate neovascularization the hemoglobin concentration in Matrigel, homogentisates were measured as described (29Athanasopoulos A.N. Economopoulou M. Orlova V.V. Sobke A. Schneider D. Weber H. Augustin H.G. Eming S.A. Schubert U. Linn T. Nawroth P.P. Hussain M. Hammes H.P. Herrmann M. Preissner K.T. Chavakis T.

Leukocyte Biol. 2005; 78: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell ELISA and Matrix ELISA—Cell and matrix ELISA were performed for the detection of CCN1 in primary human osteoblasts and in their ECM. Briefly, osteoblasts were grown to confluency on 96-well plates. Thereafter, cells were washed and incubated in the absence or presence of stimuli in 0.2% fetal calf serum-containing medium for different time periods at 37 °C, as indicated in the figure legends. Following incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1), and blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 22°Cand then incubated with the first antibody (against CCN1, dilution 1:1000) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% Tween 20 followed by the addition of appropriate secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody and the substrate 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS). Total binding was quantitated at 405 nm, and nonspecific binding (binding of the secondary antibody to wells, in which the first antibody was omitted) was used as blank and was subtracted to calculate specific binding. Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from cultured primary human osteoblasts using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and digested with RNase-Free DNase (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to remove any contaminating genomic DNA. cDNA synthesis from total RNA was performed by the first strand cDNA synthesis kit for reverse transcription-PCR (Roche Diagnostics GmbH) according to the manufacturer's protocol. cDNA synthesis from total RNA was performed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Roche Diagnostics GmbH). To detect the expression of CCN1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in primary human osteoblasts, the cDNA was used as a template for a normal PCR-reaction using primers specific for either CCN1 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and it was incubated with Taq DNA polymerase (MBI-Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and the following primers: for CCN1, 5′-gcg ctc tcc acc tgc ccc-3′ and 5′-aac tcc acc tcg gag gca-3′; and for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 5′-cca ccc atg gca aat tcc atg gca-3′ and 5′-tct aga cgc cag gtc agg tcc acc-3′. All primers were synthesized by MWG-Biotech (Munich, Germany) and were of high purity salt-free quality. The polymerase was activated (3 min at 95 °C), and then up to 30 cycles (1 min at 95 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, 2 min at 72 °C) were performed on an MWG Primus 25 thermocycler. After the last cycle, all samples were incubated for an additional 10 min at 72 °C. Bone Fracture Healing—Bone fractures were generated as described previously (31Shimoaka T. Kamekura S. Chikuda H. Hoshi K. Chung U.I. Akune T. Maruyama Z. Komori T. Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15314-15322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). 10-week-old female mice were used in each group. Briefly, on day 0, an anterior knee incision was made under general anesthesia with xylazine (0.2 mg/10 g of body weight, Bayer Leverkusen, Germany) and ketamine (0.5 mg/10 g of body weight, Sankyo, Osaka, Japan). A transverse osteotomy was then performed at the middle of the tibia with a bone saw (Volvere GX, NSK Nakanishi, Japan). Fractured bones were repositioned and stabilized by inserting the inner pin of a 23-gauge spinal needle intramedullary. Bone radiographs were taken by using a volumetric-computer tomography system (Siemens). Mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of anti-CCN1 or control antibody (50 μg/mouse) at days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The fracture gap was visualized and measured at days 4 and 14 by the use of radiograph postprocessing software (ChiliPacs®, Chili, Heidelberg, Germany). Statistical Analysis—Data were compared using the Student's t test and analysis of variance as appropriate; p values of <0.05 were regarded as significant. VEGF Increases Expression of CCN1 mRNA and Protein in Osteoblasts—CCN1 protein is present at low or undetectable levels in quiescent cells but is rapidly synthesized upon stimulation (32O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 3569-3577Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Upon synthesis, CCN1 may be detected on the cell surface as well as it may be secreted extracellularly and may associate with ECM (16Yang P.D. Lau F.L. Cell Growth & Differ. 1991; 2: 351-357PubMed Google Scholar, 33Kireeva M.L. Latinkic B.V. Kolesnikova T.V. Chen C.C. Yang G.P. Abler A.S. Lau L.F. Exp. Cell Res. 1997; 233: 63-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the regulation of expression of CCN1 in primary osteoblasts. Stimulation of osteoblasts with VEGF resulted in a significant up-regulation of both CCN1 mRNA and protein (Fig. 1, A and B), whereas PDGF or TGF-β hardly affected CCN1 expression in osteoblasts. Up-regulated CCN1 was both detected in the cell surface (Fig. 1B) as well as associated with ECM preparations of the osteoblasts (Fig. 1C). In addition, the VEGF-mediated up-regulation of CCN1 was dose-dependent and time-dependent (Fig. 2, A and B). Interestingly, during the time course of osteoblast stimulation by VEGF, the pattern of up-regulation of ECM-associated CCN1 paralleled that of surface-associated CCN1.FIGURE 2VEGF induces CCN1 expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. A, CCN1 protein expression on the cell surface and extracellular matrix of osteoblasts was studied in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of VEGF (for 12 h). B, time course of the effect of VEGF (20 ng/ml) on CCN1 protein expression on the cell surface and extracellular matrix of osteoblasts. CCN1 protein expression in osteoblasts is presented as the percentage of control (CCN1 expression in the absence of competitor represents the 100% control). Data are mean ± S.D. of a typical experiment; similar results were obtained in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Osteoblast-derived CCN1 Promotes Endothelial Cell Migration—CCN1 has been reported to stimulate adhesive and migratory endothelial cell functions (17Leu S-J. Lam S.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46248-46255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 34Kireeva M.L. Mo F.-E. Yang G.P. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1326-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Consistently, recombinant CCN1 stimulated the migration of HUVEC toward fibronectin or fibrinogen in a β1-integrin- and αv-integrin-dependent manner, respectively, as observed by inhibition studies with specific blocking antibodies against these integrins (data not shown). The promigratory effect of CCN1 was comparable with the effect of VEGF (Fig. 3A). The up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts by VEGF, as observed above, prompted us to investigate whether osteoblasts might exert proangiogenic activities. In particular, we studied whether the conditioned medium of VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts could also induce endothelial cell migration. The supernatant of osteoblasts prestimulated in the presence of VEGF promoted the migration of endothelial cells toward both fibronectin and fibrinogen by 2–3-fold (Fig. 3, B and C). The supernatant of non-stimulated osteoblasts only marginally promoted HUVEC migration (Fig. 3, B and C). Moreover, HUVEC migration induced by the conditioned medium of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts was abolished in the presence of an antibody against CCN1 (Fig. 3, B and C), whereas a control antibody or an antibody to another CCN family member, CTGF, were not effective at all. To provide further evidence for the specific role of CCN1 as the pro-migratory moiety of the osteoblast supernatant, we employed an alternative way to inhibit CCN1 by engaging siRNA-mediated knockdown. Significant down-regulation of CCN1 by 40–50% was achieved in cells transfected with siRNA-targeting CCN1 but not with control non-targeting siRNA (Fig. 4A). As demonstrated in Fig. 4, B and C, conditioned medium from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts transfected with siRNA against CCN1 had reduced capacity of promoting endothelial cell migration toward fibrinogen or fibronectin, as compared with conditioned medium from VEGF-stimulated non-transfected osteoblasts or osteoblasts transfected with control non-targeting siRNA. Together, these data indicate that the pro-migratory effect of the osteoblast supernatant could be specifically attributed to the presence of CCN1 therein. Induction of Capillary Sprout Formation in Vitro by Osteoblast-derived CCN1—Above, we demonstrated that supernatant from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts and especially CCN1 therein may promote migration of endothelial cells in vitro,a process essential for neovascularization. Therefore, we next examined the role of osteoblast-derived supernatant in a more complex in vitro assay that simulates angiogenesis. Capillary-like tube formation in three-dimensional fibrin gels depends on the invasive and migratory potential of endothelial cells. In this system, the supernatant of VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts increased the number of capillary-like endothelial sprouts by 2-fold, whereas the supernatant of non-stimulated osteoblasts had no effect at all (Fig. 5). Interestingly, an antibody against CCN1 prevented the capillary-like sprout formation induced by the supernatant of VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts, whereas control antibody or antibody to CTGF failed to inhibit sprout formation (Fig. 5). These findings indicate that the VEGF-mediated up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts accounts, at least partially, for the pro-angiogenic activity in the supernatant of osteoblasts. Osteoblast-derived CCN1 Stimulates Angiogenesis in Vivo—The pro-angiogenic activity of CCN1 and the supernatant from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts was then investigated in vivo using the Matrigel plug neovascularization assay. Matrigel was injected subcutaneously into the laterodorsal abdominal region of mice in the absence or presence of recombinant VEGF or recombinant CCN1 or the supernatant from osteoblasts that were prestimulated in the absence or presence of VEGF. The Matrigel matrixes were recovered 5 days later for analysis. The degree of neovascularization was quantified by determining the hemoglobin concentration in the Matrigel matrixes. Recombinant CCN1 induced a strong angiogenic response comparable with VEGF. Furthermore, the supernatant derived from VEGF-prestimulated osteoblasts induced neovascularization in the Matrigel plugs, whereas neovascularization was only weakly induced by the supernatant of non-stimulated osteoblasts (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the supernatant derived from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts induced an almost maximal angiogenic response in the Matrigel plug assay that was comparable with the effect of recombinant VEGF (Fig. 6). Moreover, the use of an antibody against CCN1 prevented angiogenesis in response to the supernatant from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts, whereas control antibody or antibody to CTGF were not effective at all (Fig. 6; data with anti-CTGF not shown). The specificity of the inhibitory effect of the antibody to CCN1 was also demonstrated by the fact that anti-CCN1 did not affect angiogenesis directly induced by recombinant VEGF (Fig. 6). These data indicate that the angiogenic effect of the osteoblast supernatant could be attributed to the presence of CCN1 therein. Taken together, these data indicate that VEGF up-regulates CCN1 in osteoblasts, which then promotes angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. CCN1 Promotes Bone Fracture Healing in Vivo—The data obtained so far indicated that CCN1 may participate in angiogenesis in the context of bone fracture healing. To provide direct evidence for that, we studied the effect of CCN1 blockade in bone fracture healing model in mice. A transverse osteotomy was performed at the middle of the tibia, and fracture healing was followed by bone radiographs taken with a volumetric-CT system at days 4 and 14 after the fracture (31Shimoaka T. Kamekura S. Chikuda H. Hoshi K. Chung U.I. Akune T. Maruyama Z. Komori T. Matsumoto M. Ogawa W. Terauchi Y. Kadowaki T. Nakamura K. Kawaguchi H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15314-15322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). By analyzing the size of the fracture gap, we found that fracture healing at day 14 was significantly inhibited by anti-CCN1, whereas no effect of the control antibody was observed (Fig. 7). Together, these data suggest that CCN1 is involved in fracture healing. Neovascularization is indispensable for bone fracture repair, during which a coordinated cross-talk between osteoblasts and endothelial cells needs to take place in the local microenvironment (3Winet H. Bone. 1996; 19: 39S-57SCrossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 4Gerber H-P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 5Olsen B.R.

Surg. 2001; 18: 55-77PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we have demonstrated that VEGF and CCN1 may synergize in coupling osteoblasts and endothelial cells functionally. In particular, we found that osteoblast CCN1 expression is stimulated by VEGF, and this osteoblast-derived CCN1 may in turn stimulate proangiogenic functions in the endothelial cells, such as migration or capillary-like sprout formation. Additionally, we observed that osteoblast-derived CCN1 promotes angiogenesis in vivo, as well as fracture healing. Thus, our present findings point to a potential paracrine loop that may be important in the communication between osteoblasts and endothelial cells during bone angiogenesis. Among several growth factors that are up-regulated during skeletal development and induced upon injury, a major role has been attributed to VEGF for bone development and fracture repair (4Gerber H-P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 12Street J. Bao M. deGuzman L. Bunting S. Peale F.V. Ferrara N. Steinmetz H. Hoeffel J. Cleland J.L.

Investig. 2002; 110: 751-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Unequivocally, VEGF is crucial in promoting neovascularization; however, VEGF may also be a key regulator in growth plate morphogenesis and cartilage remodeling. In vivo, VEGF blockade resulted not only in the vascular ablation in the growth plate but also in impaired trabecular bone formation (10Gerber H-P. Vu T.H. Ryan A.M. Kowalski J. Werb Z. Ferrara N. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar), whereas a cartilage-specific VEGF deletion was accompanied by a similar phenotype (38Haigh J.J. Gerber H.P. Ferrara N. Wagner E.F. Development (Camb.). 2000; 127: 1445-1453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, VEGF inhibition in mice disrupted repair of femoral fractures and cortical bone defects (12Street J. Bao M. deGuzman L. Bunting S. Peale F.V. Ferrara N. Steinmetz H. Hoeffel J. Cleland J.L. Daugherty A. van Bruggen N. Redmont H.P. Carano R.A.D. Filvaroff E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9656-9661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar). VEGF also directly regulates the proliferation and migration of osteoblasts that express both VEGF receptors, and systemic inhibition in mice led to a reduction in the osteoblast numbers at the growth plates (4Gerber H-P. Ferrara N. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 223-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 39Hiratsuka S. Minowa O. Kuno J. Noda T. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Over and above these direct effects of VEGF on osteoblasts and endothelial cells, VEGF may also have “indirect” paracrine effects that orchestrate osteogenesis and angiogenesis. The here described paracrine loop mediated by the proangiogenic activities of osteoblast-derived CCN1 that is induced by VEGF may represent such a pathway for the amplification of the proangiogenic and osteoanabolic effects of VEGF. High CCN1 protein levels have been detected throughout the reparative phase of the callus, particularly in proliferating chondrocytes, osteoblasts, as well as within the newly formed osteoid (21Hadjiargyrou M. Ahrens W. Rubin C.T. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 1014-1023Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In fracture callus, VEGF expression is very early and tightly linked to the appearance of osteoblasts (41Zelzer E. McLean W. Ng Y.S. Fukai N. Reginato A.M. Lovejoy S. D'Amore P.A. Olsen B.R. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 1893-1904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and both VEGF and CCN1 have been found to co-localize in the edematous area of osteonecrosis (42Radke S. Battmann A. Jatzke S. Eulert J. Jakob F. Schutze N. J. Orthop. Res. 2006; 24: 945-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thus, our present findings suggest that VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts may represent a major source for the increased CCN1, and the functional interplay between VEGF and CCN1 shown here is consistent with these previous histological data. Additionally, although we cannot exclude that another proangiogenic moiety besides CCN1 is induced in osteoblasts by VEGF, CCN1 inhibition almost abolished the proangiogenic activities of the supernatant from VEGF-stimulated osteoblasts. As demonstrated here, CCN1 unequivocally mediates the proangiogenic activities of osteoblasts as well as fracture healing. Although these two functions of CCN1 are likely to be intimately linked with each other, it is still conceivable that the role of CCN1 in fracture healing may be the result of further not yet identified actions of CCN1 separable from its proangiogenic activities. Interestingly, CCN1-deficient mice displayed embryonic lethality due to placental vascular insufficiency and reduced vessel integrity. This effect was attributed to the reduced expression of VEGF-C in the allantoic mesoderm of CCN1-deficient mice (43Mo F.E. Muntean A.G. Chen C.C. Stolz D.B. Watkins S.C. Lau L.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 8709-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In addition, CCN1 may stimulate the expression of proangiogenic growth factors including VEGF or the basic fibroblast growth factor, as well as metalloproteases in different cells (44Brigstock D.R. Angiogenesis. 2002; 5: 153-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulation of CCN1 by VEGF in osteoblasts, as presented here, may be more complex. The intriguing observation that VEGF up-regulates CCN1, and vice versa, strengthens the hypothesis that a paracrine loop exists between CCN1 and VEGF that may regulate angiogenesis in several (patho-)physiological processes including fracture healing. The up-regulated osteoblast-derived CCN1 was associated with both the cell surface and the extracellular matrix of the osteoblasts. This extracellular matrix-associated CCN1 in the bone microenvironement may be released by proteases such as plasmin, thereby allowing it to act onto endothelial cells at more distant sites. In fact, the plasmin-mediated cleavage of CCN1 from the matrix of tumor cells was recently demonstrated (22Pendurthi U.R. Tran T.T. Post M. Rao L.V. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 9705-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The signaling intermediates responsible for the VEGF-induced up-regulation of CCN1 in osteoblasts were not addressed in this study. Recently, CCN1 expression in osteoblasts was demonstrated to be regulated by the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway (45Si W. Kang Q. Luu H.H. Park J.K. Luo Q. Song W.X. Jiang W. Luo X. Li X. Yin H. Montag A.G. Haydon R.C. He T.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 2955-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Moreover, in bladder smooth muscle cells, CCN1 overexpression increased the expression of VEGF (37Zhou D. Herrick D.J. Rosenbloom J. Chaqour B. J. Appl. Physiol. 2005; 98: 2344-2354Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Whether CCN1 may also induce VEGF expression in osteoblasts, which would implicate the existence of a VEGF-CCN1 autocrine loop in these cells, is worth addressing in a future study. Nevertheless, our present findings provide clear evidence that VEGF and CCN1 cooperate to mediate a crosstalk between osteoblasts and endothelial cells, which may be operative in bone angiogenesis and fracture healing.

https://openalex.org/W2095227131,"The longer splice isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), including mouse VEGF164, contain a highly basic heparin-binding domain (HBD), which imparts the ability of these isoforms to be deposited in the heparan sulfate-rich extracellular matrix and to interact with the prototype sulfated glycosaminoglycan, heparin. The shortest isoform, VEGF120, lacks this highly basic domain and is freely diffusible upon secretion. Although the HBD has been attributed significant relevance to VEGF-A biology, the molecular determinants of the heparin-binding site are unknown. We used site-directed mutagenesis to identify amino acid residues that are critical for heparin binding activity of the VEGF164 HBD. We focused on basic residues and found Arg-13, Arg-14, and Arg-49 to be critical for heparin binding and interaction with extracellular matrix in tissue samples. We also examined the cellular and biochemical consequences of abolishing heparin-binding function, measuring the ability of the mutants to interact with VEGF receptors, induce endothelial cell gene expression, and trigger microvessel outgrowth. Induction of tissue factor expression, vessel outgrowth, and binding to VEGFR2 were unaffected by the HBD mutations. In contrast, the HBD mutants showed slightly decreased binding to the NRP1 (neuropilin-1) receptor, and analyses suggested the heparin and NRP1 binding sites to be distinct but overlapping. Finally, mutations that affect the heparin binding activity also led to an unexpected reduction in the affinity of VEGF164 binding specifically to VEGFR1. This finding provides a potential basis for previous observations suggesting enhanced potency of VEGF164 versus VEGF120 in VEGFR1-mediated signaling in inflammatory cells.

Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (3009) Google Scholar). Its multiple biological activities during embryogenesis and in the adult organism are mediated mainly through interaction with VEGFR1 (Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (Flk-1, KDR), two structurally similar receptor tyrosine kinases expressed on vascular endothelial cells (2Terman B.I. Dougher-Vermazen M. Carrion M.E. Dimitrov D. Armellino D.C. Gospodarowicz D. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 1579-1586Crossref PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar, 3de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). VEGF-A is expressed and secreted as multiple, homodimeric isoforms that are formed as a result of differential splicing of the VEGF-A pre-mRNA (4Houck K.A. Ferrara N. Winer J. Cachianes G. Li B. Leung D.W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1806-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar, 5Tischer E. Mitchell R. Hartman T. Silva M. Gospodarowicz D. Fiddes J.C. Abraham J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The most abundantly expressed isoforms are VEGF120, VEGF164, VEGF188 in mice, and VEGF121 and VEGF165 and VEGF189 in humans. Although all variants contain the same binding sites for VEGFR1 and VEGFR2, they differ in their affinity for heparin due to the presence or absence of two basic heparin-binding domains (HBDs) encoded by exons 6 and 7 (6Robinson C.J. Stringer S.E. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 853-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo, both domains independently mediate interactions with glycosaminoglycans, the most common of which, heparan sulfate, is linked to core proteins as heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), which are immobilized on the cell surface and in the ECM (7Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 435-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar). VEGF120, which lacks a heparin-binding domain, is freely diffusible in the extracellular space, whereas VEGF164 and VEGF188 exhibit moderate and high binding affinity, respectively, resulting in partial or complete retention of these isoforms in HSPG-rich compartments (8Neufeld G. Cohen T. Gengrinovitch S. Poltorak Z. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (3165) Google Scholar). In addition, the exon 7-encoded peptide also contains yet unidentified residues that confer to VEGF165 the ability to bind to the VEGF co-receptor NRP1 (9Soker S. Takashima S. Miao H.Q. Neufeld G.

The significance of the heparin-binding VEGF isoforms was revealed by the finding that mice engineered to express exclusively the non-heparin-binding VEGF120 have defects in VEGF extracellular gradient formation and microvessel branching, resulting in the death of most animals shortly after birth (10Carmeliet P.

Not only do the heparin-binding and VEGF isoforms play different roles in vascular development, they also confer different biological activities in tumor angiogenesis (13Cheng S.Y. Nagane M.

Furthermore, VEGF164, but not VEGF120, is preferentially associated with pathological angiogenesis and inflammation in the eye (16Ishida S. Usui T. Yamashiro K. Kaji Y. Amano S. Ogura Y. Hida T.

These findings highlight the importance of better understanding the biology of the HBD. The HBD of the major VEGF isoform, VEGF165, is a lysine- and arginine-rich region comprising the 55 COOH-terminal residues that can be released by plasmin digestion of the full-length protein (Fig. 1A). This region mainly consists of exon 7- and exon 8-encoded sequences that exhibit 96% amino acid identity between the mouse and the human homolog as well as a high degree of sequence homology with other members of the VEGF family of growth factors (supplemental Fig. 1). Its solution structure has been reported, showing that this domain is formed by a clearly defined NH2-terminal (residues 1–29) and COOH-terminal (residues 29–55) subdomain (18Fairbrother W.J. Champe M.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. Starovasnik M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Each subdomain contains a two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet and two disulfide bonds, which dominate the fold (18Fairbrother W.J. Champe M.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. Starovasnik M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 19Keck R.G. Berleau L. Harris R. Keyt B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, a short α-helix is located in the COOH-terminal subdomain, where it is packed against the β-sheet. Electrostatic potential calculations revealed that the charge is distributed rather unevenly across the domain surface with the bulk positive charge located on one side of the COOH-terminal subdomain (18Fairbrother W.J. Champe M.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. Starovasnik M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Although it has been hypothesized that basic side chains within this region contribute to the majority of the binding energy by interacting with the carboxylate and sulfate groups of glycosaminoglycans (18Fairbrother W.J. Champe M.A. Christinger H.W. Keyt B.A. Starovasnik M.A. Structure. 1998; 6: 637-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), the molecular features governing VEGF-heparin recognition are still relatively uncharacterized. This may be due to the fact that the VEGF HBD does not contain any of the common heparin-binding motifs that are present in several heparin-binding proteins (20Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Weiler J.M. Linhardt R.J. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). The present study was undertaken to identify clusters of amino acids of mouse VEGF164 involved in heparin binding using site-directed mutagenesis and to better understand the role of this interaction in VEGF function. Reagents—Human 125I-VEGF165 and tritium-labeled heparin ([3H]heparin) were obtained from GE Healthcare and PerkinElmer Life Sciences, respectively. Heparinase I and III were purchased from Sigma. The expression vectors pPICZαC-VEGF120 and pPICZαC-VEGF164 were used for expression of full-length, untagged VEGF isoforms and mutant VEGF164 variants in Pichia pastoris and were a kind gift of Dr. M. Golding (Cancer Research UK, London, UK). Site-directed Mutagenesis and Cloning—In vitro site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange™ multisite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation (supplemental Table 1) were designed to bind to adjacent sequences or to separate regions on the same strand of the template plasmid (pPICZαC-VEGF164). All mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. To generate the recombinant HBD protein, a DNA fragment encoding the COOH-terminal 55-residue fragment of VEGF165 (HBD) was generated by PCR and subcloned in frame with the α-factor signal peptide of the pPICZαC expression vector (Invitrogen). For recombinant production of wild-type VEGF isoforms and VEGF164 mutants, all expression constructs were transformed into competent P. pastoris yeast cells (strain KM71H) as described by the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Transformants were screened for high secreting colonies using a colony blotting protocol (22Wung J.L. Gascoigne N.R. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 808-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Recombinant Protein Production and Purification—Recombinant wild-type and mutant VEGF proteins were produced in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris according to the manufacturer's protocol with slight modifications. Briefly, the highest secreting yeast transformants of each protein variant were grown in 500 ml of BMGY medium at 29–30 °C until the culture reached an A600 of 3. To induce expression, yeast pellets were then resuspended in 100 ml of BMMY containing 0.01% Antifoam 204 (Sigma). Cultures were grown at 29–30 °C for 36–42 h, and methanol was added to a final concentration of 1% every 12 h to maintain induction of transgene expression. Supernatants were cleared, concentrated, and equilibrated in Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography binding buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, with 2.7 mm KCl, 2 mm KH2 PO4, 8 mm Na2PO4, 300 mm NaCl) and incubated with pre-equilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed with binding buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with elution buffer (PBS containing 150 mm NaCl and 40 mm imidazole) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Eluted protein fractions were concentrated and then loaded onto a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column using an AKTA FPLC™ system (GE Healthcare) for buffer exchange and isolation of protein dimers. Proteins were eluted in Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Tissue Factor Induction in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (Cascade Biologics, Bath, UK) were seeded in a 12-well plate at 8 × 104 cells/well in M200 medium (Cascade Biologics). After 24 h, the cells were serum-starved for 4 h in M200 medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The cells were rinsed once with serum-free medium, and VEGF variants (0.3 pmol) or medium alone was added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the cells were rinsed once with PBS, and total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Reverse transcription of RNA was performed using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Real time quantitative PCR (Taqman) was conducted using 1× PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), 1× Tissue Factor Assay-on-Demand/FAM (Applied Biosystems), and 2 μl of cDNA in a total volume of 10 μl. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as the internal control for all reactions and was amplified with human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase primers and probe (Applied Biosystems). Reactions were loaded on a 384-well plate and run in the Applied Biosystems Prism 7900HT System. Gene expression levels were quantified by using the comparative threshold (Ct) method as described (23Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127160) Google Scholar). The assays were performed three times for each condition using duplicate samples. Analytical Heparin Affinity Chromatography—To determine the heparin-binding affinity of VEGF variants, 200 μl of binding buffer (20 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 50 μg of purified protein were loaded onto a 1-ml HiTrap heparin HP column (GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min using the AKTA FPLC™ system. Unbound material was removed by washing with binding buffer, and bound proteins were then eluted with a linear salt gradient (0.1–1 m NaCl) over 15 column volumes at 0.5 ml/min (NaCl concentration increment per fraction: 0.06 m). Alternatively, proteins were loaded in binding buffer containing 0.15 m NaCl and eluted with a steeper salt gradient (0.15–1.5 m NaCl) over 11 column volumes (NaCl concentration increment 0.123 m). Fractions were subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation, and the protein pellets were diluted in SDS sample buffer, separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and analyzed by Coomassie staining or Western blotting using a monoclonal anti-VEGF antibody (C-1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Nitrocellulose Binding Assay—Binding of heparin to proteins was assessed in solution based on a protocol by Maccarana and Lindahl (24Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, [3H]heparin (0.05 μm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of VEGF in binding buffer (25 mm Tris, 150 NaCl, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.5) for 1 h at 37°C. Nitrocellulose filters (0.45-μm pore size; Millipore, Billerica, MA) were pre-equilibrated in BSA-free binding buffer and were placed into separate pockets of a vacuum manifold (Millipore). The samples were transferred onto the filters, and unbound [3H]heparin was removed by applying vacuum and washing with BSA-free binding buffer. The amount of bound [3H]heparin retained by the filter was determined by counting in a β-scintillation counter (Micro Beta Trilux; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data analysis for saturation and competition binding was performed using GraphPad Prism 4 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Binding assays were repeated three times for each protein. Competition Binding Assays with Soluble VEGF Receptors—96-well microtiter plates (Wallac HB Isoplate; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were coated with Fc-specific anti-human IgG (Calbiochem) at a concentration of 5 μg/ml in PBS (pH 7.4) overnight. The wells were blocked with Super Block™ (Pierce) for 15 min, and receptor/Fc chimeric proteins (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) in binding buffer (100 μl/well, PBS with 0.1% BSA) were added at a final concentration of 400 pm (VEGFR1/Fc), 2 nm (VEGFR2/Fc), or 1.8 nm (NRP1/Fc). After 1.5 h at room temperature, the plate was washed, and 100 μl of binding buffer containing 0.01 μCi (for VEGFR1) or 0.02 μCi (for VEGFR-2 and NRP1) of 125I-labeled VEGF165 and increasing concentrations of cold competitor (VEGF164) were added to the wells. Binding to equilibrium was carried out at 37 °C (VEGFR1/2) or at room temperature (NRP1) for 2 h (VEGFR1/2) or 3 h (NRP1), after which the plate was washed, and binding of 125I-VEGF was quantitated in a β-scintillation counter. IC50 values were calculated using the one-site competition binding analysis program (GraphPad Prism 4 Software). All experiments, in duplicate, were performed three times. CD Spectrophotometry—CD spectra were recorded in the wavelength range 198–260 nm with a Jasco J-810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) using a 0.1-cm path length stain-free cell. The proteins were analyzed at a concentration of 0.15 mg/ml in Tris-buffered saline at room temperature. Spectra were recorded in millidegrees of ellipticity (θ). The solvent spectrum (Tris-buffered saline) was subtracted from the sample spectra, and the subtracted spectra were converted to mean residue ellipticity (CD signal per amino acid residue, [θ]) in degrees × cm2 × dmol-1 by the equation,θmrw=θ×Mmrw/10×c×l(Eq. 1) where c represents the protein concentration in mg/ml, l is the cell path length in cm, and Mmrw is the mean residue molecular weight of the VEGF164 dimer. All measurements were done twice, with identical results. Quantitation of Blood Vessel Growth in the Aortic Ring Assay—Thoracic aortas were dissected from male Fisher rats (6–10 weeks) and placed into a dish containing EB medium (Cambrex) supplemented with 2 mm glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (100 μg/ml). The aortas were carefully cleaned of all surrounding adventitial tissues under a dissecting microscope and cut into 1-mm-wide rings. Each of the rings was embedded in a rat collagen mix (2 mg/ml collagen I, 4 ml of H2O, 1× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 2.34 mg/ml NaHCO3) in 4-well multidishes (Nunc), and the collagen gel was then overlaid with 450 μl of EBM medium. The plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere for 7 days, and EBM medium was replaced every 48 h with control medium or medium containing purified VEGF variants (4.4 nm). Rings that did not show any signs of vessel growth after 48 h were discarded. After 7 days, the rings were washed and fixed with paraformaldehyde and stained with biotinylated isolectin B4, and images of aortic rings were captured using a DMIR epifluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with a Retiga RXi CCD camera (Qimaging, Burnaby, Canada). To quantify blood vessel growth, RGB images of the rings were converted to 8-bit grayscale images in Photoshop (Adobe), and blood vessels were traced in a new layer using a 9-point pencil tool. The new image layer was then binarized, and the traced lines were skeletonized using Image-J software (National Institutes of Health). All white pixels in the skeletonized image were counted and expressed relative to the circumference of the aortic ring in order to provide a measure of the total number of new blood vessels normalized to the aortic ring size. All data analyses were performed in a masked fashion. Binding of VEGF Species to Cells and Biological Matrices—Porcine aortic endothelial cells were seeded at 3 × 105 cells/well in 12-well dishes and were cultured for 24 h. The cells were washed with binding buffer (Ham's F-12K medium containing 0.1% (w/v) BSA, pH 7.5), and binding of purified mouse VEGF variants (7.14 nm) to the cell surface and matrix was carried out in binding buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Unbound VEGF was removed, and bound VEGF was enzymatically dissociated from the cells by adding heparinase I and III (0.5 unit/ml) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), containing 50 mm NaCl, 4 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% (w/v) BSA. After 1 h at 37°C, the medium of each well was collected with a pipette, and the cells were washed with binding buffer (final wash). The concentration of VEGF in the medium after heparinase treatment and in the final wash was determined by a mouse-specific VEGF enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (VEGF Quantikine® enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; R&D Systems). The experiment was performed in duplicates and was repeated three times. Binding of the VEGF variants to basement membranes was carried out using sections of the mouse eye. Eyes from 2-month-old C57bl/6 female mice (Charles River Laboratories) were harvested and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight. The eyes were then washed in PBS for 3 h and placed in a 10% sucrose solution for 4 h, followed by incubation in a 30% sucrose solution overnight. On the following day, the eyes were placed in OCT embedding compound, frozen on dry ice, and stored at -80 °C until sectioned. The slides were thawed, and sections were circled with a pap pen and then rehydrated in PBS. The sections were incubated in blocking solution (10% goat serum, 1% BSA, 0.05% Triton X-100 in 1× PBS) containing no protein or 10 μm of purified proteins overnight at 4 °C. The samples were incubated with blocking solution for 15 min followed by incubation with goat anti-VEGF antibody (1:100; R&D Systems) for 1 h. The samples were washed and incubated in Alexa-Fluor 633-conjugated donkey anti-goat secondary antibody (1:500; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 45 min. The sections were then mounted using Vectashield with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and imaged using an epifluorescence microscope (DMRA2; Leica) equipped with a digital CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Binding to two separate eye sections of the same eye was performed three times for each protein species. Statistical Analysis—All values were expressed as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. The unpaired Student's t test was used when two groups were compared. Data were analyzed by using a post hoc comparison test (Bonferroni) when three or more groups were compared. Differences were considered statistically significant when p values were <0.05. Site-directed Mutagenesis of the VEGF164 HBD—Sequence alignment has shown that the HBD of VEGF165 and related VEGF family members have no significant sequence homology to other known heparin-binding proteins (19Keck R.G. Berleau L. Harris R. Keyt B.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 344: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The absence of definitive heparin-binding consensus sequences has made it difficult to elucidate features within this region that are important for heparin recognition. However, based on solution structure data and, in particular, the surface charge distribution of the COOH-terminal fragment, it has been suggested that a putative heparin-binding site may involve two basic clusters consisting of side chains of residues Arg-13, Arg-14, and Lys-15 and residues Lys-30, Arg-35, Arg-39, and Arg-46. These clusters are located on either side of the NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal subdomain, respectively, forming a pocket that could accommodate a heparin oligosaccharide (18Fairbrother W.J.

Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, we utilized a structure-guided mutagenesis approach focusing on the involvement of six solvent-exposed arginines and one lysine in the two basic amino acid clusters identified by NMR and assessed their role in heparin binding by replacing these residues with alanine. Double and triple substitutions were primarily examined, since structural and mutational analysis of other heparin binding proteins suggests that multiple basic residues are required to coordinate interaction with the heparin oligosaccharide (26Amara A.

Alanine mutagenesis was also applied to a Lys-26 outside the two basic clusters for control purposes (Fig. 1C and supplemental Fig. 2, A–J). VEGF164 HBD mutants were generated, expressed in P. pastoris, and purified to >90% purity (supplemental Fig. 3). Determination of the Bioactivity of VEGF164 HBD Mutants—As a first step in the analysis of mutants, we sought to determine if the Pichia-derived proteins were active and to establish if mutations or recombinant production led to major structural defects, problems with dimerization, or aggregation that would impair VEGF signaling. During angiogenesis, VEGF induces vessel growth by activating endothelial cells. One endothelial cell gene that is up-regulated in response to VEGF signaling is tissue factor (TF) (31Mechtcheriakova D. Wlachos A. Holzmuller H. Binder B.R. Hofer E. Blood. 1999; 93: 3811-3823Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TF up-regulation is mediated by VEGFR2, a VEGF receptor that can be activated by all VEGF isoforms and thus is not dependent on a functional HBD (32Shen B.Q. Lee D.Y. Cortopassi K.M. Damico L.A. Zioncheck T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 5281-5286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If mutants were defective in TF induction, it would suggest that HBD mutations had destabilized the entire VEGF protein, and this would obviously impede further analysis. TF mRNA levels were ∼5-fold higher in VEGF164-treated cells than in buffer-treated control cells. The non-heparin-binding VEGF120 was similar to VEGF164, and all VEGF164 HBD mutants were active and induced TF gene transcription to levels that were comparable with that induced by VEGF164 (Fig. 2). These results suggest that the mutations did not cause major structural changes in these proteins that would interfere with VEGF-mediated signaling. Heparin Binding Activity and Secondary Structure Analysis of VEGF164 HBD Mutants—Next, heparin-Sepharose chromatography was employed as a method to screen the heparin-binding affinity of the mutants. A heparin-Sepharose column was loaded with purified protein dimers, and"
https://openalex.org/W1982739452,"Spectroscopic methods involving the sudden injection or ejection of electrons in materials are a powerful probe of electronic structure and interactions. These techniques, such as photoemission and tunnelling, yield measurements of the 'single-particle' density of states spectrum of a system. This density of states is proportional to the probability of successfully injecting or ejecting an electron in these experiments. It is equal to the number of electronic states in the system able to accept an injected electron as a function of its energy, and is among the most fundamental and directly calculable quantities in theories of highly interacting systems. However, the two-dimensional electron system (2DES), host to remarkable correlated electron states such as the fractional quantum Hall effect, has proved difficult to probe spectroscopically. Here we present an improved version of time-domain capacitance spectroscopy that allows us to measure the single-particle density of states of a 2DES with unprecedented fidelity and resolution. Using the method, we perform measurements of a cold 2DES, providing direct measurements of interesting correlated electronic effects at energies that are difficult to reach with other techniques; these effects include the single-particle exchange-enhanced spin gap, single-particle lifetimes in the quantum Hall system, and exchange splitting of Landau levels not at the Fermi surface."

https://openalex.org/W1998806777,"Nek2 is a cell cycle-regulated serine/threonine protein kinase that is up-regulated in human cancers. Functionally, it is implicated in control of centrosome separation and bipolar spindle formation in mitotic cells and chromatin condensation in meiotic cells. Two major splice variants have been described in vertebrates, Nek2A and Nek2B, that differ in their non-catalytic C termini. Recently, a third splice variant, Nek2C, was identified that lacks an eight-amino acid internal sequence within the C-terminal domain of Nek2A. This excision occurs at the same position as the Nek2A/Nek2B splice point. As predicted from their high degree of similarity, we show here that Nek2C shares many properties with Nek2A including kinase activity, dimerization, protein phosphatase 1 interaction, mitotic degradation, microtubule binding, and centrosome localization. Unexpectedly, though, the non-centrosomal pool of protein exhibits a marked difference in distribution for the three splice variants. Nek2C is mainly nuclear, Nek2B is mainly cytoplasmic, and Nek2A is evenly distributed within nuclei and cytoplasm. Mutagenesis experiments revealed a functional bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) that spans the splice site leading to Nek2C having a strong NLS, Nek2A having a weak NLS, and Nek2B having no NLS. Finally, we identified a 28-kDa protein in nuclear extracts as a potential novel substrate of Nek2. Thus, alternative splicing provides an unusual mechanism for modulating Nek2 localization, enabling it to have both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions.

Thus, alternative splicing provides an unusual mechanism for modulating Nek2 localization, enabling it to have both nuclear and cytoplasmic functions. Cell division involves the replication and segregation of genetic material between daughter cells. During mitotic and the second meiotic division, duplicated sister chromatids are segregated, whereas during the first meiotic division homologous chromosomes are segregated. Mitosis and meiosis are both highly complex processes involving condensation of chromatin, breakdown of the nuclear envelope, and reorganization of the microtubule cytoskeleton into a spindle capable of bipolar segregation. These events are known to be regulated in large part by cell cycle-dependent protein kinases, most notably members of the Cdk (cyclin-dependent kinase), Plk (polo-like kinase), Aurora, and Nek (NIMA-related kinase) families (1Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2,: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (1228) Google Scholar). The Neks represent a comparatively large family (11 members in humans) of serine/threonine kinases that are related to the NIMA kinase of Aspergillus nidulans (2O'Connell M.J. Krien M.J. Hunter T. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13,: 221-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). NIMA was first identified in a screen for conditional loss-of-function mutants that were unable to enter mitosis (3Oakley B.R. Morris N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96,: 1155-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). nimA mutants remain blocked in G2 despite activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (4Osmani A.H. McGuire S.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 1991; 67,: 283-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of wild-type NIMA drives cells into mitosis from any point in the cell cycle with premature condensation of chromosomes and spindle formation (5Osmani S.A. Pu R.T. Morris N.R. Cell. 1988; 53,: 237-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Interestingly, overexpression of Aspergillus NIMA in fission yeast, Xenopus oocytes, and cultured human cells induces aspects of a premature mitosis, including condensation of chromosomes, suggesting that similar pathways may be conserved in higher eukaryotes (6Lu K.P. Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 81,: 413-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 7O'Connell M.J. Norbury C. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1994; 13,: 4926-4937Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). More recently, it has been reported that NIMA activity is essential for phosphorylation of histone H3 thereby promoting chromatin condensation in Aspergillus (8De Souza C.P. Osmani A.H. Wu L.P. Spotts J.L. Osmani S.A. Cell. 2000; 102,: 293-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). So far it remains unclear which if any of the human Neks represents the closest functional homologue of NIMA. Mitotic functions have been proposed for Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 (also known as Nercc1) (9Roig J. Mikhailov A. Belham C. Avruch J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16,: 1640-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 10Yin M.J. Shao L. Voehringer D. Smeal T. Jallal B. J. Biol.

Nek2 is the most closely related of the human proteins to NIMA based on amino acid conservation within the N-terminal catalytic kinase domain (13Fry A.M. Oncogene. 2002; 21,: 6184-6194Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). However, depletion studies in human cells do not support an essential role for Nek2 in mitotic entry (14Fletcher L. Cerniglia G.J. Yen T.J. Muschel R.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1744,: 89-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Rather there is strong evidence that in mitotic cells Nek2 contributes to centrosome separation and perhaps reorganization of the microtubule network at the G2/M transition (11Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14,: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 15Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17,: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 16Rapley J.

Nek2 may have additional roles in chromatin condensation, at least in meiotic cell division, as it has been shown to phosphorylate the chromatin-associated protein, high mobility protein A2, and be activated during the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/p90Rsk2-stimulated condensation of chromatin in mouse pachytene spermatocytes (17Di Agostino S. Rossi P. Geremia R. Sette C. Development. 2002; 129,: 1715-1727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Di Agostino S. Fedele M. Chieffi P. Fusco A. Rossi P. Geremia R. Sette C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15,: 1224-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In human cultured cells, Nek2 is predominantly expressed as two alternative splice variants, Nek2A and Nek2B (19Hames R.S. Fry A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361,: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These differ at their non-catalytic C termini as a result of an alternative polyadenylation signal within intron 7 that prevents splicing to the terminal exon 8 in Nek2B. Nek2A, therefore, encodes a protein of 445 amino acids (48 kDa), whereas Nek2B encodes a protein of 384 amino acids (44 kDa) with the sequence diverging after amino acid 370. Downstream of the kinase domain, both Nek2A and Nek2B share a leucine zipper motif (amino acids 304-340) that promotes dimerization, autophosphorylation, and activation of the kinase (20Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274,: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 21Rellos P. Ivins F.J. Baxter J.E. Pike A. Nott T.J. Parkinson D.M.

This is followed by a short motif (amino acids 333-370) shown to be required for centrosome targeting and microtubule binding (22Hames R.S. Crookes R.E. Straatman K.R. Merdes A. Hayes M.J. Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16,: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). However, the position of splicing means that a binding site for protein phosphatase 1 (PP1 3The abbreviations used are: PP1protein phosphatase 1NLSnuclear localization sequenceGSTglutathione S-transferaseCTDC-terminal domainIVTin vitro translationKESTRELkinase substrate tracking and elucidationIPimmunoprecipitationHEK cellshuman embryonic kidney cellsNESnuclear export signalAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex cyclosome.3The abbreviations used are: PP1protein phosphatase 1NLSnuclear localization sequenceGSTglutathione S-transferaseCTDC-terminal domainIVTin vitro translationKESTRELkinase substrate tracking and elucidationIPimmunoprecipitationHEK cellshuman embryonic kidney cellsNESnuclear export signalAPC/Canaphase-promoting complex cyclosome.; amino acids 383-386) and two APC/C-dependent degradation motifs, a KEN box (amino acids 391-399), and an MR-tail (amino acids 444-445), are present in Nek2A but missing from Nek2B (23Helps N.R.

It also suggests that Nek2B may not be subject to regulation by PP1, although this hypothesis is complicated by the fact that Nek2A and Nek2B can heterodimerize via their leucine zippers, at least in vitro (19Hames R.S.

Recently, a third splice variant of Nek2 was identified during a yeast two-hybrid screen using PP1γ1 and PP1γ2 as bait (26Fardilha M. Wu W. Sa R. Fidalgo S. Sousa C. Mota C. da Cruz e Silva O.A. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030,: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This isoform is identical to Nek2A except that it lacks amino acids 371-378. This eight-amino acid deletion starts at the splice donor position of the Nek2A-Nek2B splice site but uses a downstream splice acceptor sequence within exon 8. This variant was originally named Nek2A-T as it was isolated from testis mRNA. However, we prefer now to call it Nek2C because Nek2A is also expressed in the testis (26Fardilha M. Wu W. Sa R. Fidalgo S. Sousa C. Mota C. da Cruz e Silva O.A. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030,: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 27Rhee K. Wolgemuth D.J.

Kilfin G. Bernstein A. Motro B. Oncogene. 1998; 16,: 1813-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), whereas Nek2C is clearly not exclusively expressed in testis (see results). In this study we investigated the properties of Nek2C in comparison to those of Nek2A and Nek2B. As one would predict from the position of the regulatory motifs described above, Nek2C is an active kinase that can undergo autophosphorylation, bind microtubules, localize to the centrosome, and be degraded in early mitosis. However, upon overexpression, there is a significant increase in accumulation of Nek2C in the nucleus as compared with Nek2A or Nek2B, and through mutagenesis we show that this is the result of the eight-amino acid deletion creating a strong nuclear localization sequence (NLS) in Nek2C that is weaker in Nek2A and absent in Nek2B. We speculate that the nuclear accumulation of Nek2C may be essential to catalyze the phosphorylation of nuclear substrates that promote mitotic or meiotic entry. Plasmid Construction—pCMV-mycNek2A, pCMV-mycNek2A-K37R, and pCMV-mycNek2B have been previously described (15Fry A.M. Meraldi P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1998; 17,: 470-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 19Hames R.S. Fry A.M. Biochem. J. 2002; 361,: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To generate pCMV-mycNek2C, a C-terminal fragment was excised from pCMV-mycNek2A with BspEI and XbaI restriction enzymes and replaced with the corresponding fragment from pACT-Nek2C (26Fardilha M. Wu W. Sa R. Fidalgo S. Sousa C. Mota C. da Cruz e Silva O.A. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030,: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because BspEI is blocked by overlapping dam methylation, dam-Escherichia coli JM110 were used for transformation. Mutations were introduced using the Gene Tailor™ site-directed mutagenesis system (Invitrogen). The GST-PP1α and His-Nek2A-CTD bacterial expression constructs were generated by subcloning human PP1α from pBS-mycPP1α into the pGEX-4T1 vector and amino acids 255-445 of Nek2A into the pET22b vector, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing by Lark Technologies, Inc. (Saffron Walden, UK). Cell Culture, Transfection, and Extraction—All media and additives were obtained from Invitrogen. Human cervical epithelia HeLa cells were cultured in minimal essential media with 1% nonessential amino acids, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic mix. Human osteosarcoma U2OS cells and human embryonic kidney cells, HEK 293, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic/antimycotic. Cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Transient transfections were carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell extracts were prepared as previously described (30Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283,: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells using TRI Reagent (Sigma) according to manufacturer's instructions. Extracted RNA (5 μg) was used for first strand synthesis using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and oligo-(dT)20 at 50 °C for 60 min. PCR amplification of Nek2A- and Nek2C-specific fragments of 153 and 129 bp, respectively, was performed in a 50-μl reaction using Taq polymerase (Invitrogen), 2 μl of first strand cDNA synthesis mixture as template, and the following primers: 1077F, 5′-GGAACGGAAGTTCCTGTC-3′; 1229R, 5′-CACTTGGACTTAGATGTGA-3′. Amplified products were purified using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen Ltd., Crawley,UK), subcloned into a pBlueScript vector, linearized with SmaI, and sequenced. In Vitro Translation (IVT)—Nek2, Rab4, and lamin A proteins were generated by IVT from appropriate vectors using the TnT-coupled transcription/translation kit (Promega, Southampton, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. For radioactive detection of proteins, reactions were carried out in the presence of [35S]methionine, separated by SDS-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation (IP) Kinase Assays—For IP of proteins generated by IVT, 10 μl of pre-washed protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were added to 490 μl of Neb buffer (30Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283,: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) containing 9 μl of nonradioactive IVT reaction and mixed on a rotating wheel for 30 min at 4 °C before centrifugation at room temperature for 10 s. The precleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube, and 1 μl of mouse anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass.) was added and incubated on ice for 60 min. Meanwhile, 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were blocked with 5 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate in 500 μl of Neb buffer on a rotating wheel for 30 min. The blocked beads were centrifuged at room temperature for 10 s, the supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed 3 times with 100 μl of Neb buffer. The blocked beads were resuspended in 50 μl of Neb buffer and added to the antibody-IVT mixtures. This bead slurry was placed on a rotating wheel for 60 min at 4 °C before centrifugation for 10 s at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the beads were washed twice with 100 μl of Neb buffer and finally resuspended in 100 μl of Neb buffer. A 25-μl aliquot was transferred to a fresh tube for Western blot analysis of the efficiency of the IP. The remaining 75-μl aliquot was spun down, and the bead pellet was used for kinase assays. For IP of cell lysates, essentially the same protocol was followed except that to preclear the extract, 50 μl of pre-washed protein G-Sepharose beads were added to 40 μl cell lysate diluted in 500 μl of ice-cold Neb buffer, and then 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the antibody-extract mixtures. Immune complexes generated by IP were washed three times with 100 μl kinase assay buffer (30Fry A.M. Nigg E.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283,: 270-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The beads were resuspended in a final volume of 50 μl of kinase assay buffer (containing [γ-32P]ATP and β-casein) and incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. After separation by SDS-PAGE, the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. PP1 Binding, Dimerization, and Microtubule Binding Assays—GST, GST-PP1α, and His-Nek2A-CTD were expressed in BL21 E. coli and purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Invitrogen) according to standard protocols. Purified proteins were then dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline for storage at -80 °C. For pulldown assays purified proteins were rebound to glutathione-Sepharose or Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for 60 min followed by 3 washes with NETN buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris·HCl, pH 8, 0.5% Nonidet-P40). The His-Nek2A-CTD bead complexes were blocked by first washing 3 times with 0.5% Marvel in phosphate-buffered saline and then incubating with rabbit reticulocyte lysate for 30 min before 3 washes in NETN buffer. Protein-bead complexes were then incubated with IVT reaction mixes for 60 min before washing 3 times in NETN buffer containing 450 mm NaCl. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Microtubule pulldown assays with proteins generated by IVT were performed as previously described (22Hames R.S. Crookes R.E. Straatman K.R. Merdes A. Hayes M.J. Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16,: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Degradation Assays—Preparation of Xenopus laevis cytostatic factor egg extracts, in vitro degradation assays, and the addition of MG132 were performed as previously described (24Hames R.S. Wattam S.L. Yamano H. Bacchieri R. Fry A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20,: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Generation of S- and M-phase-arrested U2OS cells was also as described (24Hames R.S. Wattam S.L. Yamano H. Bacchieri R. Fry A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20,: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed at -20 °C for 30 min using 100% methanol (precooled at -20 °C). Antibody staining and epifluorescence microscopy was performed as previously described (11Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14,: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 22Hames R.S. Crookes R.E. Straatman K.R. Merdes A. Hayes M.J. Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16,: 1711-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-γ-tubulin (0.15 μg/ml; Sigma), mouse anti-Myc (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), rabbit anti-PP1α (31Amador F.C. Henriques A.G. da Cruz E. Silva O.A. da Cruz E. Silva E.F. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 2004; 26,: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-Nek2 (2 μg/ml; Invitrogen), mouse anti-phospho-H3 (1:400; Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-nucleophosmin (1:500 (32Shu X. Fry A.M. Tulloch B. Manson F.D. Crabb J.W. Khanna H. Faragher A.J. Lennon A. He S. Trojan P. Giessl A. Wolfrum U. Vervoort R. Swaroop A. Wright A.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14,: 1183-1197Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar)). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit and Alexa 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (1 μg/ml; Invitrogen). DNA was stained with 1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or 0.2 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 dye (Calbiochem) incubated together with the secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted on slides in a drop of FluoroGuard anti-fade reagent (Bio-Rad). Images were captured on Nikon TE300 or Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscopes. To score whether transfected cells had predominantly nuclear accumulation of recombinant protein, cytoplasmic accumulation, or relatively equal distribution, pixel levels were measured in representative areas of the nucleus and cytoplasm using analySIS software. If these values were >10% different, then the cell was judged to have the protein predominantly in one compartment or the other. Nuclear-Cytoplasmic Fractionation—Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HeLa cells transfected with Myc-tagged Nek2 constructs was performed using the Nuclear/Cytosol fractionation kit (Cambridge BioScience Ltd., Cambridge, UK) according to manufacturer's instructions. Western blots were performed as described (11Faragher A.J. Fry A.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14,: 2876-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) using anti-Myc (1:1000; Cell Signaling Technology), anti-lamin A/C (1:30; Chemicon, Chandlers Ford, UK), and anti-α-tubulin (1:3000; Sigma) antibodies. KinaseSubstrate Tracking and Elucidation (KESTREL) Analysis—HEK 293 cells were lysed in extraction buffer (EB; 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 14 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc), and the nuclear fraction was sedimented by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The nuclear pellet was incubated for 20 min with EB plus 0.5 m NaCl, and protein was extracted by sedimenting insoluble material by centrifugation for 20 min at 28,000 × g. The supernatant was filtered, desalted on Sephadex G25 fine, and chromatographed on heparin-Sepharose. Aliquots of the desalted extracts and eluted fractions were diluted 10-fold in 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 10μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm Pefabloc). These aliquots were incubated for 5 min with 3 mm MnCl2, 2 KBq/ml [γ-32P]ATP in the absence or presence of Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, or Nek9 recombinant kinases (Invitrogen) and then separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and autoradiographed. Expression of Nek2C in Human Cell Lines—Three splice variants of the cell cycle-regulated Nek2 protein kinase have been described, Nek2A, Nek2B, and Nek2C (originally called Nek2A-T; Fig. 1A). To confirm the expression of Nek2C, primers were designed for use in reverse transcription-PCR analysis that spanned the splice site and, when used on plasmids containing Nek2A and Nek2C cDNAs, amplified distinct bands of 153 and 129 bp, respectively (Fig. 1B). Using these primers, a major band of 153 bp, representing Nek2A, was amplified using mRNA isolated from HeLa, U2OS, and HEK 293 human cell lines. However, a 129-bp band at the expected size of Nek2C was also reproducibly detected, although this was ∼10-fold less abundant (Fig. 1, B and C). To confirm the identity of this band, it was excised from the gel, re-amplified using the same primers, purified, and subcloned into a pBlueScript vector. DNA sequencing confirmed that the 129-bp product contains the predicted sequence of Nek2C and lacks the 24 nucleotides present in Nek2A (Fig. 1D). Hence, Nek2C is a bona fide splice variant whose expression can be detected, albeit consistently more weakly than Nek2A, in different human cell lines. Nek2C Is an Active Kinase That Binds PP1α and Undergoes Dimerization—Nek2C contains the complete catalytic kinase domain (Fig. 1A). It also contains the leucine zipper motif that is required for dimerization and autophosphorylation and the PP1 binding site (20Fry A.M. Arnaud L. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274,: 16304-16310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 23Helps N.R. Luo X. Barker H.M. Cohen P.T. Biochem. J. 2000; 349,: 509-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, the 8-amino acid deletion removes two serine residues (Ser-377 and -378) present in Nek2A that could act as sites for regulation (26Fardilha M. Wu W. Sa R. Fidalgo S. Sousa C. Mota C. da Cruz e Silva O.A. da Cruz e Silva E.F. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1030,: 468-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). First, to compare Nek2A and Nek2C kinase activity, full-length Myc-tagged Nek2C, Nek2A, and Nek2A-K37R (catalytically inactive mutant) proteins were either translated in vitro (data not shown) or expressed in HEK 293 cells by transient transfection (Fig. 2A). Nek2 proteins were then immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies, and equal protein recovery was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-Nek2 antibody. Kinase assays performed on the immune complexes revealed that Nek2A-K37R was inactive as expected, whereas Nek2A and Nek2C were both capable of phosphorylating the control substrate β-casein to a similar extent (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Equivalent levels of autophosphorylation of Nek2A and Nek2C were also detected. Second, to test PP1 binding, a GST-PP1α fusion protein was expressed in E. coli and used to pull down in vitro translated proteins (Fig. 2B). Both Nek2A and Nek2C proteins bound GST-PP1α but not GST alone. In contrast, Nek2B, which lacks the PP1 binding site, Nek2A-F386A, which has a mutation in the PP1 binding site, and lamin A did not bind GST-PP1α. Third, to test dimerization, in vitro translated Nek2A, Nek2B, Nek2C, and the control protein Rab4 were mixed with a His-tagged Nek2A C-terminal domain fusion protein that contains the entire non-catalytic domain including the leucine zipper motif. As predicted, all Nek isoforms, but not Rab4, were pulled down by nickel-affinity chromatography (Fig. 2C). Hence, the eight-amino acid deletion in the non-catalytic domain does not interfere with the kinase activity, PP1 binding, or dimerization of the Nek2C protein. Nek2C Is Degraded in Mitotic Egg Extracts and Prometaphase-arrested Cells—Total Nek2 exhibits cell cycle-dependent mRNA and protein expression with low levels in G1 and increased expression in S and G2 (33Hayward D.G. Clarke R.B. Faragher A.J. Pillai M.R. Hagan I.M. Fry A.M. Cancer Res. 2004; 64,: 7370-7376Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 34Fry A.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Nigg E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270,: 12899-12905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). After mitotic entry, Nek2A is specifically targeted for proteasomal degradation as a result of APC/C-mediated ubiquitylation, whereas Nek2B remains stable as it lacks the degradation motifs present in the C terminus of Nek2A (24Hames R.S. Wattam S.L. Yamano H. Bacchieri R. Fry A.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20,: 7117-7127Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 25Hayes M.J. Kimata Y. Wattam S.L. Lindon C. Mao G. Yamano H. Fry A.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8,: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). These degradation motifs, a KEN-box and the C-terminal MR dipeptide, are present in Nek2C, and we predicted that this isoform would also be degraded in mitosis. To test this we first generated Nek2A and Nek2C proteins by IVT and added them to mitotic extracts prepared from cytostatic factor-arrested Xenopus eggs. These extracts contain all the necessary machinery for APC/C-mediated ubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation (35Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36,: 581-"
https://openalex.org/W2164557329,"Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 3 (PfEMP3) is a parasite-derived protein that appears on the cytoplasmic surface of the host cell membrane in the later stages of the parasite's development where it associates with membrane skeleton. We have recently demonstrated that a 60-residue fragment (FIa1, residues 38–97) of PfEMP3 bound to spectrin. Here we show that this polypeptide binds specifically to a site near the C terminus of α-spectrin at the point that spectrin attaches to actin and protein 4.1R in forming the junctions of the membrane skeletal network. We further show that this polypeptide disrupts formation of the ternary spectrin-actin-4.1R complex in solution. Importantly, when incorporated into the cell, the PfEMP3 fragment causes extensive reduction in shear resistance of the cell. We conjecture that the loss of mechanical cohesion of the membrane may facilitate the exit of the mature merozoites from the cell.

We conjecture that the loss of mechanical cohesion of the membrane may facilitate the exit of the mature merozoites from the cell. The intraerythrocytic form of Plasmodium falciparum, the agent of the most severe type of human malaria, exports many (according to a proteomic estimate, up to 400) proteins into the host cell in the course of its growth and development (1Hiller N.L.

Genome Biol. 2006; 7: R12Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Certain of these proteins are known to associate with the host cell membrane skeleton and thereby modify its structure and properties. Among the changes that have been reported are an altered morphology, an increased membrane rigidity, and an enhanced propensity to adhere to the vascular endothelium (4Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Adv. Parasitol. 2001; 50: 1-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Several such proteins that bind to the red cell membrane skeleton have so far been characterized. When the parasite first invades red cells, it deposits RESA (the ring parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen) at the membrane skeleton of the newly invaded cell where it binds to spectrin and protects against thermal damage (5Foley M. Tilley L. Sawyer W.H. Anders R.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 6Da Silva E. Foley M. Dluzewski A.R. Murray L.J. Anders R.F. Tilley L. Mol.

PfEMP1 clusters on the red cell surface at dimpled areas called knobs by binding of its intracellular domain to the parasite-encoded protein KAHRP (knob-associated histidine-rich protein) from which knobs are formed (9Waller K.L. Nunomura W. Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2002; 119: 125-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and to spectrin and actin (10Oh S.S. Voigt S. Fisher D. Yi S.J. LeRoy P.J. Derick L.H. Liu S. Chishti A.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 108: 237-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). KAHRP itself is stabilized at the membrane by interactions with the fourth repeat of spectrin α-chain (11Pei X. An X. Guo X. Tarnawski M. Coppel R. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31166-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). MESA (the mature parasite-infected erythrocyte surface antigen) binds to the 30-kDa domain of protein 4.1R and displaces the host protein p55 (12Bennett B.J. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15299-15306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Waller K.L. Nunomura W. An X. Cooke B.M. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Blood. 2003; 102: 1911-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Its role in parasite biology is still uncertain, but interference with MESA binding is lethal to the parasite (14Magowan C. Coppel R.L. Lau A.O. Moronne M.M. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3196-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 3 (PfEMP3), with which we are concerned here, is a large protein of 315 kDa that is expressed from the late ring stage onward and is exported via the Maurer's clefts, vesicular structures of parasite origin, into the cytoplasm of the red cell, where it associates with membrane skeleton. However, the function of PfEMP3-skeleton interaction has not been explored.

Kotula L. DeSilva T.M. Curtis P.J. Speicher D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6636-6644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spectrin heterodimers then self-associate head to head to form spectrin tetramers (16Ungewickell E. Gratzer W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 88: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The tetramers are connected at their ends to junctional complexes that are primarily comprised of spectrin, actin, and 4.1R (17Cohen C.M. Tyler J.M. Branton D. Cell. 1980; 21: 875-883Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The importance of the spectrin-actin-4.1R ternary complex in maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity is demonstrated by the findings that mutations in β-spectrin (18Becker P.S. Morrow J.S. Lux S.E. J. Clin. Investig. 1987; 80: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) or 4.1R (19Conboy J.G. Shitamoto R. Parra M. Winardi R. Kabra A. Smith J. Mohandas N. Blood. 1991; 78: 2438-2443Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) result in decreased membrane mechanical stability and cell fragmentation in vivo. The ternary complex formation of spectrin with actin and 4.1R involves the β-spectrin N terminus, which harbors two actin and two 4.1R binding sites (20An X. Debnath G. Guo X. Liu S. Lux S.E. Baines A. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10681-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In contrast to the β-spectrin N terminus, very little is known regarding the α-spectrin C terminus that is in apposition to the β-spectrin N terminus. Studies from sphJ mice (where a nonsense mutation in exon 52 of the erythroid α-spectrin gene eliminates the C-terminal 13 amino acids) strongly suggested the α-spectrin C terminus is also critical to the stability of the junctional complex (21Wandersee N.J. Birkenmeier C.S. Bodine D.M. Mohandas N. Barker J.E. Blood. 2003; 101: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). We show here that the receptor site of PFEMP3 on the membrane is a motif close to the C terminus of the spectrin α-chain. This is the region of the spectrin αβ-heterodimer that forms the junctions of the membrane skeletal network by ternary interaction with actin and protein 4.1R. We further show that the peptide acts to destabilize the junction and thereby the membrane as a whole. These findings enabled us to identify a role of the interaction between PfEMP3 and spectrin in the infected erythrocytes. Materials—Fresh blood was taken from healthy volunteers with informed consent. pGEX-4T-2 vector and glutathione-Sepharose 4B were purchased from Amersham Biosciences Inc., restriction enzymes, amylose resin affinity column, and monoclonal anti-MBP antibody from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and reduced form glutathione and isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside from Sigma. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratory (West Grove, PA). Renaissance chemiluminescence detection kit was from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. 3′3′5′5′-tetra-methylbenzidine microwell peroxidase substrate was from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). The CM-5 sensor chip, amino coupling kit, and other reagents for surface plasmon resonance assay were purchased from BIAcore (Piscataway, NJ). Dextran T40 was from Amersham Biosciences, and electrophoresis reagents from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA). Preparation of Spectrin, Recombinant Spectrin Fragments, and PfEMP3 Fragment—Spectrin from erythrocytes was prepared according to Tyler et al. (22Tyler J.M. Hargreaves W.R. Branton D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 5192-5196Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Spectrin fragments and single repeats were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (23An X. Guo X. Sum H. Morrow J. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The FIa1 fragment of PfEMP3 was cloned into pMAL-p2X vector using BglII and EcoRI upstream and downstream, respectively. The MBP-tagged FIa1 polypeptide was purified using an amylose resin affinity column. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically, using extinction coefficients calculated from the tryptophan and tyrosine contents. Proteins were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl) for pulldown assay and against HBS-EP buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.05% (v/v) surfactant P20) for surface plasma resonance assay. For resealing experiments, polypeptides were dialyzed against hypotonic buffer (5 mm Tris, 5 mm KCl, pH 7.4). All proteins were clarified by ultracentrifugation at 230,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C before use. GST Pulldown Assay—Glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged recombinant spectrin polypeptides were coupled to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads at room temperature for 30 min. Beads were pelleted and washed. MBP-tagged F1a1 fragment (at a final concentration of 1 μm) was added to the coupled beads to a final volume of 100 μl and a coupled protein concentration of 1 μm, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and pelleted, washed, and eluted with 10% SDS. The pellet was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose membrane and exposure to anti-MBP antibody to detect F1a1 binding to spectrin polypeptides. GST was used as negative control in all experiments. To study the effect of PfEMP3 F1a1 peptide on its ability to interfere with spectrin heterodimer assembly, 1 μm GST-tagged α17-C was coupled to beads. The binding of His-tagged β 1–5 fragment to the immobilized α fragment in the absence or presence of PfEMP3 peptide at various concentrations (ranging from 1 to 24 μm) was assessed using the same approach described above. Surface Plasmon Resonance Assay—Binding was measured in a BIAcore 3000 instrument. The instrument was programmed to perform a series of binding measurements with increasing concentrations of analyte over the same surface. Conditions were as described previously (11Pei X. An X. Guo X. Tarnawski M. Coppel R. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31166-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Spectrin or the GST-tagged fragment containing EF1/2 of the C terminus of α-spectrin was covalently coupled to a CM-5 biosensor chip using an amino coupling kit. MBP-FIa1 at various concentrations was passed through the cell. The surface was regenerated between injections with 50 mm NaOH. Binding and dissociation kinetics were analyzed with the aid of the software BIAeval 3.0, and binding constants were derived, with the assumption of a 1:1 interaction. ELISA Assay—Competitive inhibition was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Spectrin dimer was coated on a 96-well plate overnight at 4 °C. The plate was washed and then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at room temperature. FIa1 fragment (preincubated without or with increasing concentrations of EF1/2) was added to the spectrincoated plate and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes, the binding of MBP-tagged FIa1 to spectrin was detected by anti-MBP antibody, followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG. The color was developed by adding 3′3′5′5′-tetra-methylbenzidine microwell peroxidase substrate and read by an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. Falling Ball Assay—The falling ball assay was performed as previously described (24Gimm J.A. An X. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). F-actin was prepared by polymerizing 5mg ml–1 G-actin in 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 mm EGTA for 30 min at room temperature. The mixture of F-actin (8 μm with respect to monomer), spectrin tetramers (0.3 μm with respect to dimer), and 4.1R (0.3 μm) was incubated without or with increasing concentrations of FIa1 for 30 min at 4°C in 50-μl microcapillaries to allow binding. The extent of complex formation was reflected by the viscosity of the mixture as described previously (24Gimm J.A. An X. Nunomura W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7275-7282Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Introduction of FIa1 Polypeptide into Erythrocyte Ghosts and Measurement of Membrane Stability—MBP or MBP-tagged FIa1 polypeptide at a series of concentrations was added to hypotonically lysed cells. After restoration of isotonicity and warming, as described previously, the stability of the ghosts was assayed in the ektacytometer and expressed in terms of the rate of decline of the deformability index, as the membranes vesiculated under constant shear (25Mohandas N. Clark M.R. Health B.P. Rossi M. Wolfe L.C. Lux S.E. Shohet S.B. Blood. 1982; 59: 768-774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mapping the PfEMP3 Binding Site in Spectrin—The positions in the α- and β-spectrin sequences of the recombinant fragments used in this study are shown in Fig. 1A. All recombinant proteins were expressed at 16 °C, at which the yield was optimal, and allowed the isolation of soluble products in a state of high purity (11Pei X. An X. Guo X. Tarnawski M. Coppel R.

The structure of the PfEMP3 protein is illustrated in Fig. 1B, and the position of the FIa1 fragment (spectrin binding region) is indicated. The GST pulldown assay was used to identify the PfEMP3 binding site in spectrin. Recombinant GST-tagged spectrin fragments covering the entire α- and β-chain sequences were prepared and each was assayed for binding to FIa1. As seen in Fig. 1C, the binding occurred to only one of the α-spectrin fragments, α17-C. There was no binding to GST or to other spectrin fragments. The α17-C construct comprises repeats 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and the C-terminal element with four EF-hands. We next examined the binding of FIa1 to all these parts of the large fragment individually and obtained a positive result for only one of them. This comprised 65 amino acids, embracing EF-hands 1 and 2 (Fig. 1D). Thus we localized the PfEMP3 binding site to the C terminus of the α-spectrin chain. The binding of FIa1 to spectrin and to the C-terminal fragment of the α-chain, which we designate EF1/2, was further characterized by surface plasmon resonance assay. The binding profiles are shown in Fig. 2, and the derived dissociation constants of binding of FIa1 to spectrin dimer and to EF1/2 are 2.16 × 10–8 m and 7.48 × 10–8 m, respectively.FIGURE 2Interaction between F1a1 and spectrin or the EF1/2 fragment ofα-spectrin as assessed by surface plasmon resonance assay. A, spectrin was immobilized onto a CM-5 sensor chip. MBP-F1α1 at different concentrations as indicated was injected at 20 μl/min over the surface in a BIAcore 3000 instrument. The figure shows dose-response curves of F1α1 binding. B, the experiment was performed as described in panel A except that the EF1/2 fragment was immobilized onto the CM-5 sensor chip.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Inhibition of Spectrin Binding to FIa1 by the EF1/2—To confirm the specificity of the interaction between EF1/2 of the α-chain C-terminal region and PfEMP3, we performed a competitive inhibition assay. The result of the competitive ELISA assay is shown in Fig. 3, from which it can be seen that the binding of FIa1 to full-length spectrin is significantly reduced in the presence of increasing concentrations of EF1/2 fragment. Effect of FIa1 on Formation of the Spectrin-Actin-4.1R Ternary Complex—The N-terminal domain of the spectrin β-chain engages with F-actin and 4.1R, for each of which it has two binding sites (20An X. Debnath G. Guo X. Liu S. Lux S.E. Baines A. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10681-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), to form a ternary complex. In the cell this complex is at the seat of the nodes, or junctions, of the membrane skeletal network, and its disruption leads to breakdown of the membrane. Because the N-terminal region of the spectrin β-chain is in close apposition to the C-terminal part of the α-chain, we examined the possibility that attachment of PfEMP3, as represented by its active fragment, FIa1, might hinder formation of the ternary complex. This was tested in the falling ball viscosity assay. Addition of FIa1 to the mixture of F-actin, 4.1R, and spectrin was indeed found to inhibit the interaction (Fig. 4). No Effect of FIa1 on Spectrin Heterodimer Assembly—As the PfEMP3 binding is in close proximity to the nucleation site involved in spectrin heterodimer assembly, we examined the ability of PfEMP3 peptide to interfere spectrin heterodimer formation. The interaction between dimerizing spectrin fragments α17-C and β 1–5 in the absence and presence of the PfEMP3 peptide was examined by GST pulldown assay. Peptide concentrations up to 24 μm had no effect on spectrin heterodimer assembly (data not shown). Effect of FIa1 on Erythrocyte Membrane Stability—From the above result it might be expected that PfEMP3, or its active fragment, would act in a similar way inside the erythrocyte, reducing the cohesion of the junctions and thus the stability of the membrane. We accordingly introduced FIa1 into resealed ghosts at increasing concentrations and measured their stability under shear in the ektacytometer. The time course of breakdown of the membranes is reflected by the decay of the deformability index, and, as Fig. 5 reveals, the peptide exerted a striking destabilizing effect. The MBP (at a concentration of 100 μm) was without effect. As a further control we also introduced into ghosts another spectrin binding fragment of a malaria protein, the K2a+b peptide of KAHRP, which binds to repeat 4 of α-spectrin. This did not perturb membrane stability, even at a concentration of 100 μm. We have described above the nature of the interaction with the host cell membrane of PfEMP3, one of the several relatively well characterized membrane-binding proteins exported by the internalized P. falciparum parasite. Our results establish that the site of attachment to the membrane lies at the C-terminal extremity of the spectrin α-chain, which is also in, or in intimate proximity to, the site of interaction of spectrin with actin and 4.1R that forms the junctions of the membrane skeletal network. The N-terminal domain of the spectrin β-chain, to which the C-terminal part of the α-chain is linked, is sufficient to generate the ternary complex in vitro (20An X. Debnath G. Guo X. Liu S. Lux S.E. Baines A. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10681-10688Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and what we have observed here hints at a possible participation of the α-chain in the junction complex. This has indeed been suggested on the basis of the properties of erythrocytes of sphJ mice, in which the C-terminal 13 amino acids of α-spectrin were deleted (27Wandersee N.J. Birkenmeier C.S. Gifford E.J. Mohandas N. Barker J.E. Hematol. J. 2000; 1: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We cannot, at the same time, exclude that the effect of PfEMP3 or its active fragment in weakening the junction by binding to α-spectrin may be due to steric crowding. The site for attachment of PfEMP3 on spectrin is remote from that for KAHPR, which is in repeat 4 of the α-chain. It is also clear that the two proteins serve quite different functions, KAHRP being involved in knob formation (28Crabb B.S. Cooke B.M. Reeder J.C. Waller R.F. Caruana S.R. Davern K.M. Wickham M.E. Brown G.V. Coppel R.L. Cowman A.F. Cell. 1997; 89: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and thus probably adhesive interactions (29Cooke B.M. Glenister F.K. Mohandas N. Coppel R.L. Br. J. Haematol. 2002; 117: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), with no detectable influence on shear resistance of the membrane, whereas PfEMP3 affects this membrane property profoundly. RESA, which has a single binding site on the spectrin β-chain, also perturbs shear response but in the opposite direction (32Pei X. Guo X. Coppel R. Bhattacharjee S. Halder K. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. An X. Blood. 2007; 110: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), while MESA binds to a site on 4.1R, probably interfering with its attachment to the membrane (14Magowan C. Coppel R.L. Lau A.O. Moronne M.M. Tchernia G. Mohandas N. Blood. 1995; 86: 3196-3204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Merozoites have to exit the host cells before infecting new erythrocytes, but the mechanism of merozoite release remains largely unknown. It is generally believed that proteases are basically involved. One proposed model is that these proteases will proteolyze the erythrocyte skeleton proteins and the proteolytic breakdown of these proteins in turn will lead to disruption of membrane skeleton. Indeed, a number of plasmodial proteases have been identified that have activities against erythrocyte proteins (30Raphael P. Takakuwa Y. Manno S. Liu S.C. Chishti A.H. Hanspal M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 110: 259-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). More specifically, a P. falciparum-derived cysteine protease, falcipain-2 (FP-2), has been shown to cleave both ankyrin and 4.1R and this cleavage is accompanied by diminished membrane stability (31Hanspal M. Dua M. Takakuwa Y. Chishti A.H. Mizuno A. Blood. 2002; 100: 1048-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in the present study we found that resealing of fragment PfEMP3 also led to membrane instability. Our finding implies that disruption of the skeleton network by malaria proteins that are expressed at late stages of malaria development could potentially provide a mechanism for merozoite release from erythrocytes. In summary, our results shed some light on the function of the major exported proteins. While PfEMP1 is unquestionably, and KAHRP probably, involved in promoting adhesion of the parasitized erythrocyte to endothelial surfaces, RESA, which is expressed early in development, reinforces the membrane against a second invasion by a merozoite (32Pei X. Guo X. Coppel R. Bhattacharjee S. Halder K. Gratzer W. Mohandas N. An X. Blood. 2007; 110: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). As RESA disappears from the cell, late in development, PfEMP3 is secreted and accrues on the erythrocyte membrane, which it greatly weakens. A plausible function of PfEMP3 may then be to facilitate the escape of the new generation of merozoites into the bloodstream. The identification, however tentative, of these various functions may suggest a new range of targets for therapeutic intervention. It should at the same time be recalled that, at least according to proteomic analyses (1Hiller N.L. Bhattacharjee S. van Ooij C. Liolios K. Harrison T. Lopez-Estrano C. Haldar K. Science. 2004; 306: 1934-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar, 2Cowman A.F. Kappe S.H. Science. 2006; 313: 1245-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), there are probably many more, perhaps as many as 400, other as yet unrecognized exported blood-stage P. falciparum proteins, so that inquiry in this area is far from exhausted."

Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) have been solved. The enzymes are obligate homodimers, and the monomers are composed of a β/α-barrel N-terminal domain and a β-sheet C-terminal domain. Two identical active sites are formed at the dimer interface between the N-terminal domain from one subunit and the C-terminal domain from the other. In these structures substrate analogs make key contacts with residues from both monomers. In T. brucei ODC, the δ-amino group of the co-crystallized ligand (e.g. putrescine, DFMO, and d-ornithine) interacts with Asp-361 from one monomer and with Asp-332 from the other. Both of these residues are invariant among the eukaryotic ODCs; however, Asp-332 is not conserved in other members of the β/α-barrel fold decarboxylases. Comparison of the structures for enzymes with different substrate preferences (ODC, DAPDC, and cvADC) identified the 310-helix that contains Asp-332 as the key specificity element (6Shah R. Akella R. Goldsmith E.J. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Amino acid residues that project from the 310-helix interact with substrate, and both the amino acid composition of the helix and its position are variable. Substrates of different size are accommodated by changes in the distance from the 310-helix to PLP, whereas changes in amino acid composition allow specific interactions to occur with the full range of substrates. Classical studies based on Escherichia coli had suggested that the l-ornithine-specific decarboxylase activity in bacteria was limited to the AAT-fold enzymes, and that the dual specificity enzyme from S. ruminantium represented an isolated example of a β/α-barrel fold decarboxylase in bacteria with activity on l-ornithine. However, a number of novel bacterial sequences with homology to the β/α-barrel fold decarboxylases were recently identified in sequenced bacterial genomes (22Kidron H. Repo S. Johnson M.S. Salminen T.A. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 79-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this study, phylogenetic and experimental analysis suggests that the β/α-barrel fold decarboxylases segregate into four distinct groups containing ADCs, DAPDCs, ODCs, and putative CANSDCs (Fig. 1). The ODCs can be further classified into three subclades as follows: the eukaryotic ODCs, bacterial sequences containing the S. ruminantium dual specificity L/ODC, and a third group of uncharacterized bacterial ODC-like sequences. Here we have experimentally determined the substrate preferences of these putative ODCs from a diverse group of bacteria for the first time. Despite the presence of key amino acid changes in the 310-helix specificity element relative to the eukaryotic ODCs, these enzymes utilize l-ornithine as their primary substrate. In addition, the study provides experimental confirmation for a distinct clade of dual function enzymes with specificity for both l-ornithine and l-lysine, similar to that reported for the enzyme from S. ruminantium. Finally, the x-ray structure of the dual function enzyme from Vibrio vulnificus (VvL/ODC) was solved, providing insight into structural basis for the dual specificity. Comparison of the sequence alignment with the available x-ray structures allowed us to identify amino acid motifs on the 310-helix that are predictive for the function of the bacterial and eukaryotic ornithine and diaminopimelate-specific decarboxylases.

Genomic DNA from Giardia lamblia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 47085D), V. vulnificus CMCP6, and Aquifex aeolicus were kindly provided by Drs. Ching C. Wang (University of California San Francisco), Hong Zhang (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas), Joon Haeng Rhee (Chonnam University, Gwangju, Korea), and Michael Thomm (Universität Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany), respectively. Phylogenetic Analysis—Mouse ODC, E. coli ADC, S. ruminantium L/ODC, and V. alginolyticus CANSDC were each used to search the nonredundant protein data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information, GenBank™, using BLAST. Sequences were chosen to optimally represent diverse bacterial phyla and to reduce the number of members from the same phylum for the phylogenetic analysis. Sequences were aligned using ClustalX (version 1.8) (23Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35417) Google Scholar) and edited for display with GeneDoc (version 2.6.002) (24Nicholas K.B. Nicholas Jr., H.B. Deerfield II, D.W. EMBNEWS.news. 1997; 4: 14Google Scholar). Sequences from the N and C termini were removed to facilitate the alignment. Phylogenetic analysis of the aligned sequences was implemented in PAUP* (25Swofford D.L. PAUP*: Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony (and Other Methods). Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2000Google Scholar). A neighbor-joining tree with nodes assessed by 1000 bootstrap replicates was constructed and imported into TreeView (26Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Taxonomic descriptions were obtained from the NCBI (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Secondary structure predictions were performed on the sequences using the PSIPRED program. Cloning of the Putative Decarboxylase Genes—The genes for the selected ODC homologs were amplified by PCR from the genomic DNA using the primers described in supplemental Table I and cloned into one of the following His6 tag expression vectors: pET-15b (Novagen), pET-22b (Novagen), or a modified pRSET B (Invitrogen). The pRSET construct was generated from pfDHODH/pRSET (27Hurt D.E. Widom J. Clardy J. Acta Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 312-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) provided by Dr. John Clardy (Harvard Medical School, Boston), and the BamHI restriction site in pfDHODH/pRSET was mutated by QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primers mtpRSET_F and mtpRSET_R to introduce an NcoI site. Cloning of the putative ODCs was as follows: open reading frames (ORFs) from G. lamblia, M. mazei, and N. europaea were cloned into the NcoI and HindIII sites of the modified pRSET B vector; ORFs from V. vulnificus, T. maritima, A. aeolicus, and P. aeruginosa were cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-15b, and the ORF for B. henselae was cloned into the BamHI and NdeI sites of pET-15b. In the case of the ORFs from P. aeruginosa (XhoI) and B. henselae (BamHI), each contained a site (in parenthesis) that was removed by QuickChange™ mutagenesis before the final cloning step could be accomplished. The DAPDC and ADC genes of V. vulnificus CMCP6 were also amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET-15b vector. Protein Expression and Purification of the Putative Decarboxylases—E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with protein expression vectors were grown to exponential phase at 37 °C in LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml). Expression of the recombinant proteins was induced by 200 μm of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 16 °C overnight. All recombinant proteins except T. maritima and A. aeolicus enzymes were purified to homogeneity using Ni2+ affinity and gel filtration chromatography as described (28Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Osterman A.L. Kinch L.N. Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11797-11802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). For protein purification of the thermophilic enzymes (T. maritima and A. aeolicus), the cleared cell lysates were first heat-treated at 80 °C for 15 min, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation. The T. maritima enzyme was further purified by anion exchange column chromatography (MonoQ 5/50 GL column; GE Healthcare), and the A. aeolicus enzyme by Ni2+-affinity and gel filtration chromatography. Protein purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was determined by absorbance measurements at 280 nm. All enzyme preparations were used in assays without cleavage of the His6 tag. Spectroscopy-based Enzymatic Assays—Enzyme catalyzed decarboxylation was measured in a coupled enzyme system at 37 °C using the Infinity™ carbon dioxide detection reagent. The assay method has been described previously (28Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 29Osterman A.L. Kinch L.N. Grishin N.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11797-11802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Briefly, decarboxylation is coupled to phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase, allowing the rate of CO2 formation to be monitored by the oxidation of NADH (λmax = 340 nm), detected at 340 nm. All assays were performed in the presence of 50 μm PLP and 4 mm DTT. Substrate stocks used in this study were adjusted to pH 7.5 except meso-diaminopimelic acid, which was adjusted to pH 8.5 where it has greater solubility. Radiolabel-based Enzymatic Assays—The coupled enzyme assay is unsuitable for analysis at high temperature; thus the activity of the T. maritima and A. aeolicus decarboxylases was determined using the standard 14CO2-release assay as described previously (5Shah R. Coleman C.S. Mir K. Baldwin J. Van Etten J.L. Grishin N.V. Pegg A.E. Stanley B.A. Phillips M.A. J. Biol.

Acta. 1979; 568: 416-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted using l-[1-14C]ornithine, l-[U-14C]lysine, or l-[U-14C]arginine at 63 or 80 °C in assay buffer (50 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, 250 μm PLP, 20 mm HEPES, pH 8.2 and pH 7.9, at 63 and 80 °C, respectively). Assay buffers for pH profile determination utilized pH appropriate buffers (MES, pH 6.0; HEPES, pH 7.0 and pH 8.1; glycine·NaOH, pH 9.0 and 10.0; pH values were adjusted at the corresponding reaction temperature). Enzyme Inhibition by dl-DFMO—Enzymes with activity on l-ornithine were characterized to determine whether DFMO inhibited their activity in a time-dependent manner. ODCs were incubated at 37 °C with racemic dl-DFMO in buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm PLP). At different time intervals the enzyme/DFMO mixtures were diluted 100-fold into assay mixture to determine the fraction of enzyme activity remaining. Assay mixtures contained the carbon dioxide detection reagent premixed with 10 mm l-ornithine, 2.5 mm DTT, and 50 μm PLP. The data were analyzed by the method of Kitz and Wilson (31Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observed rate constant (kobs) for the enzyme inactivation was determined at different inhibitor concentrations using Equation 1. These values were then fitted to Equation 2 to determine the inactivation rate (kinact) and the apparent KI for the reaction. vv0=exp(−kobs×t) (Eq. 1) kobs=kinact[I]Kiapp+[I] (Eq. 2) Statistical Methods—GraphPad Prism4 (GraphPad Software, Inc.) was used for graphing and analyzing data for kinetic parameters. Steady-state kinetic data were fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression to obtain kcat and Km. Data for DFMO inactivation were fitted similarly to Equation 2. Crystallization of the V. vulnificus Dual Specificity Enzyme (VvL/ODC) and Data Collection—Initial crystallization conditions were identified in Hampton Research crystallization screens using the hanging drop method (Riverside, CA). Clusters of thick plate crystals formed upon mixing equal volumes (1.5 μl) of reservoir buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 30% PEG-4000, 0.2 m MgCl2) with VvL/ODC (10 mg/ml) in buffer (0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% w/v glycerol, 0.03% w/v Brij35 and 1 mm DTT) plus 10 mm l-ornithine at 16 °C. Indexing of the resulting crystals demonstrated that they had a large unit cell dimension (6–8 molecules per asymmetric unit). To search for a crystal condition that would yield a smaller unit cell, additive screening was performed using Hampton Research Additive Screen™ kit. The inclusion of n-octyl-β-d-glucoside (0.5%) yielded single rod crystals of VvL/ODC-putrescine. Diffraction to 2.0 Å revealed the space group P212121 with only two molecules per asymmetric unit. Diffraction quality VvL/ODC-putrescine crystals were obtained with microseeding at 4 °C by incubation of VvL/ODC (1.5 μl of 10 mg/ml) preincubated with 20 mm l-ornithine, 1.5 μl of reservoir buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 35% PEG-4000, 0.2 m MgCl2), and 0.3 μl of 5% w/v n-octyl-β-d-glucoside for 1 week. VvL/ODC-cadaverine crystals formed without microseeding by mixing 1.5 μl of 20 mg/ml protein preincubated with l-lysine (20–30 mm), 1.5 μl of the reservoir buffer (except 30% PEG-4000 was used instead of 35%), and 0.3 μl of 5% w/v n-octyl-β-d-glucoside The crystals were flash-frozen and stored in liquid N2 until data collection. Diffraction data for the crystals of VvL/ODC-putrescine at 1.7 Å resolution and VvL/ODC-cadaverine at 1.65 and 2.15 Å resolution were collected at 19BM beamline of Advanced Photon Source (Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). Data were processed and scaled using the HKL3000 package (32Minor W. Cymborowski M. Otwinowski Z. Chruszcz M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol.

A monomer of the T. brucei ODC (PDB entry 1F3T) with putrescine removed was modified by Chain-saw (33Schwarzenbacher R. Godzik A. Grzechnik S.K. Jaroszewski L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and used as the search model in the MolRep (34Vagin A. Teplyakov A. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 1022-1025Crossref Scopus (4148) Google Scholar) program of the CCP4–6.0 package. This analysis yielded initial solutions with R-factors of 52 and 55% and correlation coefficients of 34 and 33% for VvL/ODC-putrescine and VvL/ODC-cadaverine, respectively. Phases were improved by refinement using REFMAC5 (35Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13856) Google Scholar) resulting in density-modified maps of decent quality. The initial models for the VvL/ODC-putrescine and VvL/ODC-cadaverine were built by ARP/wARP (36Morris R.J. Perrakis A. Lamzin V.S. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 229-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Strong electron density for the product putrescine bound to the PLP cofactor was observed in the 2Fo - Fc map of VvL/ODC-putrescine structure. Crystals were grown in the presence of the substrates l-ornithine and l-lysine; however, the substrates were efficiently decarboxylated during the time frame of the crystallization, and the ligand electron density that is observed in both structures is for the decarboxylated products putrescine and cadaverine. Putrescine-PLP was modeled into the VvL/ODC-putrescine structure, and the model was rebuilt manually in Coot (37Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23237) Google Scholar), followed by refinement using REFMAC5. Water molecules were automatically added by ARP/warp during the early stages of refinement, and additional waters were added during manual refinement. TLS parameters were applied in the final rounds of refinement, resulting in a final model with a working R-factor of 18.2% and an Rfree of 21.3% for VvL/ODC-putrescine structure. Electron density for the product cadaverine bound to PLP appeared only in one active site in the map of VvL/ODC-cadaverine structure. The 1.65 Å-resolution data set of VvL/ODC-cadaverine was collected from a crystal that was incubated with 10 mm cadaverine in the final drop. A second data set at lower resolution (2.15 Å) was also obtained from a crystal that was incubated with 15 mm cadaverine. It had very similar unit cell parameters (a = 88.24 Å, b = 88.03 Å, c = 99.27 Å, α = β = γ = 90°) to the 1.65 Å data set. The model of 1.65 Å was applied to 2.15 Å data set and rebuilt in Coot. Electron density for the cadaverine-PLP was observed in both active sites. A good quality model was produced after several rounds of manual model building in Coot, followed by REFMAC5 refinement. In the final rounds, TLS parameters were applied for refinement, yielding the final model with a working R-factor of 17.5% and an Rfree of 24.0% for VvL/ODC-cadaverine structure. For both structures, PROCHECK (38Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) confirmed excellent stereochemistry. The modeling statistics are reported in Table 3. The final refined model of VvL/ODC-putrescine contains two monomers (chain A and B) in the asymmetric unit. Good electron density is observed for PLP-putrescine in both active sites, and for all amino acid residues in the protein with the following exceptions: chain A, residues 12–15 and 155–163 and chain B, residues 155–163 and 325–326 are missing. The final refined structure contains 614 water molecules. The VvL/ODC-cadaverine structure also contains two monomers in the asymmetric unit, with good electron density observed for PLP-cadaverine in both chains, and for all amino acid residues, except that chain A, r"
https://openalex.org/W2077361634,"Changes in protein-protein interactions may allow polypeptides to perform unexpected regulatory functions. Mammalian ShcA docking proteins have amino-terminal phosphotyrosine (pTyr) binding (PTB) and carboxyl-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, which recognize specific pTyr sites on activated receptors, and a central region with two phosphorylated tyrosine-X-asparagine (pYXN) motifs (where X represents any amino acid) that each bind the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2) adaptor. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that ShcA may signal through both pYXN-dependent and -independent pathways. We show that, in mice, cardiomyocyte-expressed ShcA directs mid-gestational heart development by a PTB-dependent mechanism that does not require the pYXN motifs. In contrast, the pYXN motifs are required with PTB and SH2 domains in the same ShcA molecule for the formation of muscle spindles, skeletal muscle sensory organs that regulate motor behavior. Thus, combinatorial differences in ShcA docking interactions may yield multiple signaling mechanisms to support diversity in tissue morphogenesis."

Molecular identification and functional characterization of fungal transport systems involved in nutrient uptake are crucial steps toward understanding the improvement of plant nutrition and the symbiotic relationship itself. In the present report a transporter belonging to the Trk family is identified in the model ectomycorrhizal fungus Hebeloma cylindrosporum and named HcTrk1. The Trk family is still poorly characterized, although it plays crucial roles in K+ transport in yeasts and filamentous fungi. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae K+ uptake is mainly dependent on the activity of Trk transporters thought to mediate H+:K+ symport. The ectomycorrhizal HcTrk1 transporter was functional when expressed in Xenopus oocytes, enabling the first electrophysiological characterization of a transporter from the Trk family. HcTrk1 mediates instantaneously activating inwardly rectifying currents, is permeable to both K+ and Na+, and displays channel-like functional properties. The whole set of data and particularly a phenomenon reminiscent of the anomalous mole fraction effect suggest that the transport does not occur according to the classical alternating access model. Permeation appears to occur through a single-file pore, where interactions between Na+ and K+ might result in Na+:K+ co-transport activity.

Thus, it could play a major role in both the K+ and Na+ nutrition of the fungus (and of the plant) in nutrient-poor soils. The symbiotic interaction named mycorrhization, which associates a fungus with the root system of a higher plant, is considered as a major determinant of terrestrial ecosystem productivity. It appeared very early during evolution and was instrumental in the colonization of land by plants (1Heckman D.S. Geiser D.M. Eidell B.R. Stauffer R.L. Kardos N.L. Hedges S.B.

The major benefit for the plant is an improvement of its mineral nutrition (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients) (3Smith S.E. Read D.J.

The ectomycorrhizal symbiosis typically associates woody plants from boreal and temperate forests to fungi belonging to Basidiomycota or Ascomycota (5Marmeisse R. Guidot A. Gay G. Lambilliotte R.

Therein, highly branched fungal hyphae developing between the root cortical cells form the so-called Hartig net, which constitutes the actual interface between the two partners. Exchanges of solutes and photosynthates from the plant to the fungus and of mineral nutrients from the fungus to the plant, take place at this interface. Developing from the fungal sheath that surrounds the root, external hyphae explore the soil and efficiently take up mineral nutrients (3Smith S.E. Read D.J.

Identification at the molecular level and functional characterization of fungal transport systems responsible for the uptake of mineral nutrients from the soil is, thus, crucial to understand the improvement of plant nutrition and, ultimately, the symbiotic relationship.

Gay G. New Phytol. 1987; 105: 429-435Crossref Scopus (91) Google Scholar), was used. Mycelia were grown in the dark, at 24 °C, in standard medium (modified Pachlevski-Odd-oux medium (22Rapior S. Andary C. Trans. Br. Mycol. Soc. 1987; B9: 41-44Crossref Google Scholar)) either in liquid cultures without shaking (23Scheromm P. Plassard C. Salsac L. New Phytol. 1990; 114: 93-98Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) or on agar-solidified medium (13Lambilliotte R. Cooke R. Samson D. Fizames C. Gaymard F. Plassard C. Tatry M.V. Berger C. Laudié M. Legeai F. Karsenty E. Delseny M. Zimmermann S. Sentenac H. New Phytol. 2004; 164: 505-513Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, mycelia were grown in standard liquid medium containing ∼5 mm K+ at pH 6.0 for 15 days and then transferred for 3 further days either in fresh standard medium (control treatment), in K+-free medium (potassium salts being replaced by ammonium salts in the standard medium), in Na+ supplemented medium (standard medium supplemented with 3 mm NaCl), or in standard medium adjusted to pH 4.5 or 8.0 with HCl or KOH, respectively.Ectomycorrhizae were obtained in sterile conditions with the fungus cultivated together with maritime pine seedlings grown from seeds (Pinus pinaster Soland in Ait from Medoc, Landes-Sore-VG source). Actively growing mycelia were placed close to lateral pine roots in test tubes for 2 months (24Plassard C. Barry D. Eltrop L. Mousain D. Can. J. Bot. 1994; 72: 189-197Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The pine seedlings were then transferred either in rhizoboxes filled with a thin layer of forest soil (25Casarin V. Plassard C. Souche G. Arvieu J.C. Agronomie (Paris). 2003; 23: 461-469Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar) or on vertical agar plates (cellophane-over-agar method 26Burgess T. Dell B. Malajczuk N. Mycorrhiza. 1996; 6: 189-196Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) on MMN/2 medium (27Marx D.H. Phytopathology. 1969; 59: 153-163Google Scholar) for two additional months. Ectomycorrhizal roots and external hyphae exploring the soil were then separately harvested, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and subsequently stored at –80 °C before RNA isolation and RT-PCR analyses.Isolation of HcTrk1 cDNA and Gene—The HcTrk1 cDNA was identified in a collection of about 4000 H. cylindrosporum ESTs, obtained by sequencing a cDNA library prepared from strains D2, h1, and h7 and constructed in the yeast expression vector pFL61 (13Lambilliotte R. Cooke R. Samson D. Fizames C. Gaymard F. Plassard C. Tatry M.V. Berger C. Laudié M. Legeai F. Karsenty E. Delseny M. Zimmermann S. Sentenac H. New Phytol. 2004; 164: 505-513Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) experiments were performed using the FirstChoice RLM-RACE kit following manufacturer's recommendations (Ambion, Austin, TX) revealed that the EST clone corresponded to a full-length cDNA. The complete HcTrk1 cDNA sequence has been deposited in the EMBL data base with accession number AM396516. The genomic DNA was purified from H. cylindrosporum mycelium according to Van Kan (28Van Kan J.A. Van den Ackerveken G.F. De Wit P.J. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 1991; 4: 52-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) to determine the number of gene copies by Southern blot analysis. A genomic library constructed in λ-GEM2 from the H. cylindrosporum strain h1 (29Jargeat P. Gay G. Debaud J.C. Marmeisse R. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 948-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was screened (about 5000 phages corresponding to ∼5 times the size of the Hebeloma genome) using full-length HcTrk1 cDNA as a probe and following standard protocols (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T.A. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, 1989Google Scholar). Hybridization of digested (BamHI, EcoRV, SacI, HindIII, XbaI, EcoRI, XhoI, and AccI) DNA from three positive phages with two probes corresponding to the full-length clone and to the 5′ end, respectively, was carried out to clone fragments of the HcTrk1 gene. Fragments of two isolated phages containing the HcTrk1 gene were subcloned in pBluescript and sequenced (Genome Express, Grenoble, France). Intron locations in the HcTrk1 gene were deduced from sequence alignments and search for splice junctions. The obtained genomic DNA sequence has been submitted to the EMBL data base with accession number AM396517.Sequence Analyses—Accession numbers of protein sequences used for comparison are the following: Neurospora crassa NcTrk1, CAA08813; S. cerevisiae ScTrk1, CAA89424; S. cerevisiae ScTrk2, CAA82128; Schizosaccharomyces pombe SpTrk1, P47946; Arabidopsis thaliana AtHKT1, Q84TI7; Triticum aestivum TaHKT1, AAA52749. Similarity search was done with the BLAST program at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST (31Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69163) Google Scholar). Transmembrane regions were predicted by using the TMpred program. Multiple sequence alignment was performed using Multalin (32Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4265) Google Scholar).Northern Blot and Reverse Transcription PCR—Total RNA was extracted from in vitro grown mycelia using Trizol following the manufacturer's recommendations (Invitrogen) or from ectomycorrhizal hyphae growing on soil according to Kiefer et al. (33Kiefer E. Heller W. Ernst D. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 2000; 18: 33-39Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and used for Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses, respectively. For Northern blot experiments, 30 μg of each RNA sample were loaded in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and blotted onto a nylon membrane (Biotrans(+) nylon membranes, ICN, Irvine, CA). Hybridization was performed as described (34Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7258) Google Scholar) with a full-length 32P-labeled HcTrk1 cDNA as probe. After autoradiography, the membrane was stripped and reprobed with a 32P-labeled Hebeloma EFIα probe. For RT-PCR analysis, first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 μg of total RNA from each sample using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase H minus (Promega, Madison, WI) with poly(T) as primer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. One μl of the RT product was then used for PCR amplification (40 cycles) with Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) using the following primers: 5′-GGATTGCTTCAAGGATTCTTCCGGA-3′ and 5′-GGGTGCAAGGCTCGCAACTGGAAC-3′ for HcTrk1 and 5′-ATCTCTGCAGAGAAAGCTCACCACG-3′ and 5′-CATACCCTCACCGACGTACCAGTGC-3′ for HcTUB (H. cylindrosporum α-tubulin.Complementation Assays Using S. cerevisiae—S. cerevisiae WΔ6 (Mata ade2 ura3 trp1 trk1Δ::LEU2 trk2Δ::HIS3 (35Haro R. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1613: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)) defective for K+ uptake was transformed with HcTrk1 cDNA cloned in the yeast expression plasmid pDR196 or with the empty plasmid. A K+ channel from A. thaliana, AKT1, previously shown to complement the yeast K+ uptake deficiency (36Sentenac H. Bonneaud N. Minet M. Lacroute F. Salmon J.M. Gaymard F. Grignon C. Science. 1992; 256: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar), was used as a positive control. Cells were transformed according to Dohmen et al. (37Dohmen R.J. Strasser A.W.M. Hörner C.B. Hollenberg C.P. Yeast. 1991; 7: 691-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar) and plated for 3 days on YNB medium (yeast nitrogen base, 1.7 g/liter; (NH4)2SO4, 5 g/liter; d-glucose, 20 g/liter; agar, 20 g/liter) supplemented with 50 mm K+ and the appropriate amino acids for transformant selection. For drop tests, cells from an overnight culture in YNB supplemented with 50 mm KCl were harvested by centrifugation, washed 3 times, and resuspended in distilled water to an optical density of 1 at 600 nm. Serial 10-fold dilutions of this suspension were made and dropped (10 μl) onto 2% agar plates of arginine phosphate medium (38Rodriguez-Navarro A. Ramos J. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 159: 940-945Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containing 0.1 mm K+ (nominal concentration) or supplemented with 1 or 3 mm KCl. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C and then photographed.HcTrk1 Expression and Electrophysiological Analysis in Xenopus laevis Oocytes—The coding region of HcTrk1 cDNA, fitted with BamHI and XbaI restriction sites introduced by PCR at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, was subcloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of a modified pGEMHE vector (39Liman E.R. Hess P. Weaver F. Koren G. Nature. 1991; 353: 752-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) (gift from D. Becker, Department of Molecular Plant Physiology and Biophysics, Würzburg, Germany) under the control of the T7 promoter. HcTrk1 cRNA was transcribed from linearized (NheI) plasmid using mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 Ultra kit (Ambion). Oocyte preparation, injection, and measurements were performed as described (40Lacombe B. Thibaud J.B. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 166: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oocytes were injected with 50 ng of HcTrk1 cRNA in 50 nl of diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water, control oocytes being injected with 50 nl of DEPC-treated water only. The oocytes were kept at 18 °C in a medium containing 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2,1 mm CaCl2, 2.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 5 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4, supplemented with 50 mg/ml gentamycin. Whole-cell currents were recorded using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique, 3–5 days after injection. The ionic strength of the bath solutions was kept constant by adding N-methyl-d-glucamine chloride (NMDG-Cl) to compensate for the changes in concentrations of the tested monovalent cations (K+ and Na+ in most experiments, introduced as chloride salts) in a background medium containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm CaCl2,10mm MES, 5 mm Tris, pH 6.5. Voltage-pulse protocol application, data acquisition, and data analyses were performed using pClamp9 (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) and Sigmaplot (Jandel Scientific, Erkrath, Germany). The voltage pulses ranged between +20 mV and –130 mV in –15-mV steps from a holding potential of –40 mV. To extract the HcTrk1-mediated currents, mean endogenous current values obtained from three control oocytes (water-injected) from the same oocyte batch in parallel experiments were subtracted from the currents recorded on HcTrk1-expressing oocytes.RESULTSIdentification of a Trk-type Transporter in the Ectomycorrhizal Fungus H. cylindrosporum—A sequence related to the Trk family of K+ transporters, initially described in S. cerevisiae, was identified in a H. cylindrosporum EST library (13Lambilliotte R. Cooke R. Samson D. Fizames C. Gaymard F. Plassard C. Tatry M.V. Berger C. Laudié M. Legeai F. Karsenty E. Delseny M. Zimmermann S. Sentenac H. New Phytol. 2004; 164: 505-513Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The corresponding cDNA clone (2455 bp) was sequenced, revealing an open reading frame of 2373 bp encoding a putative 791-amino acid protein with an expected mass of 87.9 kDa, designated as HcTrk1 (H.cylindrosporumTransporter of K+). RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends experiments confirmed that the cDNA clone comprised the full-length coding sequence. The deduced HcTrk1 amino acid sequence displays 12 hydrophobic domains, like other members of the Trk family initially thought to possess 12 transmembrane segments (19Gaber R.F. Styles C.A. Fink G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 2848-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 41Ko C.H. Gaber R.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4266-4273Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 42Anderson J.A.

Latterly, based on multiple sequence alignments and residue conservation, Durell et al. (14Durell S.R. Hao Y. Nakamura T. Bakker E.P. Guy R. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 775-788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) have proposed that members of the Trk superfamily, which comprises Trk and KtrAB from prokaryotes, Trk from yeast, and HKT from plants, have evolved from minimal bacterial K+ channel proteins displaying two transmembrane segments, M1 and M2, surrounding a hydrophobic pore P, forming the so-called MPM structure (44Molina M.L. Barrera F.N. Fernandez A.M. Poveda J.A. Renart M.L. Encinar J.A. Riquelme G. Gonzalez-Ros J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18837-18848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Trk transporters present four sequential MPM motifs, named A to D (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence of HcTrk1 shares the highest levels of similarity (∼40%) with the potassium transporters SpTrk1, ScTrk2, and NcTrk1 of S. pombe, S. cerevisiae, and N. crassa. The sequence alignments in the hydrophobic core corresponding to the four MPM motifs (Fig. 1B) reveal much higher levels of similarity (62% between HcTrk1 and ScTrk1).A clone containing the full-length HcTrk1 gene was obtained by screening a H. cylindrosporum genomic library using the full-length cDNA fragment as a probe. Alignment of the nucleotide sequence of HcTrk1 cDNA with the genomic sequence revealed that the CDS comprises 20 introns, all displaying a similar size, close to 60 bp (Fig. 1C). Southern blot analyses carried out using the full-length cDNA fragment as a probe indicated that the HcTrk1 gene is probably present in a single copy (data not shown).HcTrk1 Complements a Yeast Mutant Defective for K+Uptake—S. cerevisiae mutant strains defective for K+ uptake can be complemented by expression of heterologous Trk transporters from e.g. S. pombe (45Lichtenberg-Frate H. Reid J.D. Heyer M. Höfer M. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 152: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or N. crassa (43Haro R. Sainz L. Rubio F. Rodriguez-Navarro A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Expression of HcTrk1 in S. cerevisiae WΔ6, a mutant defective for K+ uptake, was found to restore yeast growth on media containing K+ in the mm concentration range (Fig. 2). No complementation was observed when the concentration of K+ was decreased to 0.1 mm. Thus, in this type of growth test, HcTrk1 appears less efficient than the Arabidopsis AKT1 channel (used as a positive control (36Sentenac H. Bonneaud N. Minet M. Lacroute F. Salmon J.M. Gaymard F. Grignon C. Science. 1992; 256: 663-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar)). Adding 3 mm Na+ in the growth medium did not increase the efficiency of HcTrk1 to restore the yeast mutant growth on low K+ medium (data not shown).FIGURE 2HcTrk1 complements S. cerevisiae mutant cells defective for K+ uptake. Cells from the yeast mutant strain WΔ6(trk1-Δ::LEU2 trk2-Δ::HIS3) defective for K+ uptake were transformed with either HcTrk1 cDNA cloned in the yeast expression plasmid pDR196 or the empty plasmid or with the A. thaliana K+ channel AKT1 cDNA as a positive control. Drop tests were performed on arginine phosphate medium containing about 0.1 mm K+ (nominal concentration) or on AP medium supplemented with 1 or 3 mm KCl. The plates were incubated for 3 days at 30 °C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HcTrk1 Mediates Na+and K+Transport in Xenopus Oocytes—Electrophysiological analyses were carried out to further investigate the functional properties of HcTrk1 using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique after heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Currents were recorded in bath solutions containing either 100 mm K+ or 100 mm Na+. Typical recordings obtained in control or HcTrk1-expressing oocytes are shown in Fig. 3A. HcTrk1 expression gave rise to instantaneously activating inwardly rectifying currents, of greater magnitude in the Na+ bath than in the K+ bath. The bath concentration of K+ or Na+ was then varied in the 10–100 mm range, and the magnitude of HcTrk1 current was plotted versus the concentration of the monovalent cation. In the case of K+, the resulting isotherm was quasi-linear (Fig. 3B, left panel). In the case of Na+, a hyperbolic relationship appeared (Fig. 3B, right panel), indicative of a saturation process that could be described using Michaelis-Menten formalism with a Km parameter of 26 mm.FIGURE 3HcTrk1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes mediates K+ and Na+ transport.A, examples of current traces recorded in control oocytes (injected with water, left panels) or in HcTrk1-expressing oocytes (right panels) recorded in 100 mm KCl (upper panels) or in 100 mm NaCl (lower panels). The voltage step ranged between +20 mV and –130 mV in –15-mV steps from a holding potential of –40 mV. B, effect of K+ or Na+ concentration on HcTrk1 current. For each oocyte in each bath solution, the HcTrk1 current was defined as the total current in HcTrk1-expressing oocyte minus the control current (mean current obtained for three control oocytes from the same batch in the same bath). The bath solution contained 1 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm MES, 5 mm Tris, pH 6.5, as standard background medium, and 10, 50, 80, or 100 mm KCl (left panel) or NaCl (right panel). The ionic strength of the solutions was kept constant by adding N-methyl-d-glucamine to compensate for the change in K+ or Na+ concentration (no added NMDG in 100 mm K+ and in 100 mm Na+). Normalized HcTrk1 current was HcTrk1 current at –115 mV in the presence of a given concentration of K+ (Na+) expressed as percent of the HcTrk1 current recorded at the same potential in 100 mm K+ (Na+). Data are the means (± S.D.) obtained from 8–12 HcTrk1-expressing oocytes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)HcTrk1 Ionic Selectivity—Selectivity of HcTrk1 for alkali cations was then investigated in Xenopus oocytes using bath solutions containing 100 mm concentrations of either Li+,Na+,K+, Rb+,Cs+, or NMDG (this large organic cation being used as non-permeant control). Comparison of HcTrk1-expressing oocytes and control oocytes revealed that HcTrk1 was significantly permeable to K+ and Na+ only (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4HcTrk1 selectivity for alkali cations. The bath solution contained 100 mm concentrations of either Li+,Na+,K+,Rb+,Cs+, or NMDG in the standard background medium. A, representative current-voltage (I-V) curves recorded in a control oocyte injected with water (upper panel) or in a HcTrk1-expressing oocyte (lower panel). B, mean steady state current recorded at –130 mV in HcTrk1-expressing oocytes (black bars) compared with water-injected (control) oocytes (white bars). Bath solutions are as in A.

The effect of external alkali cations on HcTrk1 current was studied by adding 20 mm K+,Rb+,Li+, Cs+, or NMDG to a bath solution containing 80 mm Na+.Li+, which is not permeant through HcTrk1 (Fig. 4), was without any significant effect on the HcTrk1 current when compared with the corresponding NMDG control treatment. The other cations reduced the current, with the non-permeant species Rb+ and Cs+ probably acting as blockers and the permeant K+ as a competitor (Fig. 5).FIGURE 5Inhibition by K+,Rb+, and Cs+ of HcTrk1 cur"
https://openalex.org/W2156136078,"SGIP1 has been shown to be an endophilin-interacting protein that regulates energy balance, but its function is not fully understood. Here, we identified its splicing variant of SGIP1 and named it SGIP1α. SGIP1α bound to phosphatidylserine and phosphoinositides and deformed the plasma membrane and liposomes into narrow tubules, suggesting the involvement in vesicle formation during endocytosis. SGIP1α furthermore bound to Eps15, an important adaptor protein of clathrin-mediated endocytic machinery. SGIP1α was colocalized with Eps15 and the AP-2 complex. Upon epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, SGIP1α was colocalized with EGF at the plasma membrane, indicating the localization of SGIP1α at clathrin-coated pits/vesicles. SGIP1α overexpression reduced transferrin and EGF endocytosis. SGIP1α knockdown reduced transferrin endocytosis but not EGF endocytosis; this difference may be due to the presence of redundant pathways in EGF endocytosis. These results suggest that SGIP1α plays an essential role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by interacting with phospholipids and Eps15.

These results suggest that SGIP1α plays an essential role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis by interacting with phospholipids and Eps15. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis governs not only the routine uptake of membranes and nutrient receptors but also the internalization of several ligand-stimulated receptors, channels, and transporters (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422,: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar). Clathrin triskelions assemble into polyhedral lattices on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. Binding of clathrin to the plasma membrane is mediated by adaptor proteins that interact with clathrin and with specialized cytoplasmic motifs of transmembrane proteins and/or phospholipids (2Kirchhausen T.

The AP-2 complex recruits other adaptor proteins, such as amphiphysin,β-arrestin, epsin, and Eps15. These adaptor proteins can also interact with each other and with other components, such as dynamin, of clathrin-mediated endocytosis machinery.Accompanied by the binding of clathrin and its adaptor proteins to the plasma membrane, membrane curvature is generated to form a coated pit (1Conner S.D. Schmid S.L. Nature. 2003; 422,: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (3017) Google Scholar). The process of membrane curvature leads to the formation of a deeply invaginated membrane followed by the fission of a nascent coated vesicle. Adaptor proteins, such as epsin and amphiphysin, directly bind to and deform liposomes into tubules in vitro (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev.

These domains deform the plasma membrane into narrow tubules.We attempted to isolate a novel tubulin- and/or MT-binding protein and purified a protein with a molecular mass of about 100 kDa (p100). During the study, p100 was found to be highly homologous to a recently reported protein named Src homology 3-domain growth factor receptor-bound 2-like (endophilin) interacting protein 1 (SGIP1), the function of which is not fully understood (14Trevaskis J. Walder K. Foletta V. Kerr-Bayles L. McMillan J. Cooper A. Lee S. Bolton K. Prior M. Fahey R. Whitecross K. Morton G.J. Schwartz M.W. Collier G.R. Endocrinology. 2005; 146,: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It is likely that p100 is a longer splicing variant of SGIP1; therefore, it was named SGIP1α. It remains elusive whether its tubulin binding is significant, but we have found that SGIP1α is an endocytic protein, which directly interacts with phosphoinositides and Eps15.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESTubulin Blot Overlay—Tubulin blot overlay was performed as described (15Kremer L. Dominguez J.E. Avila J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175,: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 16Balaban N. Goldman R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1992; 21,: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Samples to be tested were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with PBS containing 5% fat-free powder milk overnight at 4 °C and then equilibrated with PEM buffer (100 mm PIPES/NaOH, pH 6.8, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT) for 10 min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with 30 μg/ml tubulin in PEM buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4° C. After washing in PBS, the membrane was subjected to immunoblot analysis using anti-tubulin α mAb (DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich).Purification of p100 and Mass Spectrometry—All the purification procedures were carried out at 0-4 °C. Twenty rat brains were homogenized in 200 ml of buffer A (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) followed by ultracentrifugation. The pellet was rehomogenized in 200 ml of buffer A followed by ultracentrifugation. The pellet was again homogenized in 100 ml of buffer A containing 1.5 m NaCl. The homogenate was gently stirred for 30 min followed by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was then dialyzed against buffer B (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT) overnight followed by ultracentrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 65 ml of buffer C (buffer B containing 6 m urea) and gently stirred for 30 min. After the sample was centrifuged, the supernatant was applied to an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column (2.6 × 10 cm, GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) equilibrated with buffer C. Elution was performed with 60 ml of buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl. Fractions of 5 ml each were collected. The active fractions (fractions 6-12) were collected and diluted with 210 ml of buffer D (20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 4 m urea). The sample was applied to a HiPrep 16/10 Q Fast Flow column (1.6 × 10 cm, GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) equilibrated with buffer D. Elution was performed with a 200-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-0.5 m) in buffer D. Fractions of 4 ml each were collected. The active fractions (fractions 22-27) were collected. The sample was subjected to precipitation by the chloroform/methanol/water system (17Pohl T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182,: 68-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and dissolved in 15 ml of buffer E (10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 0.6% CHAPS, and 4 m urea). The sample was applied to a TSKgel (0.75 × 7.5 cm, HA-1000, Tosoh) equilibrated with buffer E. Elution was performed with a 30-ml linear gradient of potassium phosphate (10-500 mm) in buffer E. Fractions of 1 ml each were collected. The active fractions (fractions 11-18) were collected and subjected to precipitation by the chloroform/methanol/water system (17Pohl T. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182,: 68-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The sample was dissolved in 5 ml of buffer F (20 mm bis-Tris/HCl, pH 5.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 4 m urea) and applied to a Mono Q 5/50 GL column (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) equilibrated with buffer F. Elution was performed with a 20-ml linear gradient of NaCl (0-500 mm) in buffer F. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected. The active fractions (fractions 16-19) were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (18Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68,: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar). After the protein band corresponding to p100 was excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, the resultant peptides were desalted by Zip tips C18 (Millipore) and subjected to infusion nanoESI QQTOF mass spectrometry (QSTAR Pulsar i Applied Biosystems/MDS SCIEX). Partial aa sequences were obtained with peptide ion fragmentation due to high collision energy. The sequences obtained were subjected to a search for sequence similarity against the current NCBI data base using the Mascot Search Program (Matrix Science Ltd.).Construction of Expression Vectors—Oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CGG GAT CCA TGA TGG AAG GAC TGA AAA AAC GTA CA-3′ and 5′-ATC TCG AGT TAG TTA TCT GCC AAG TAC TTT CCT GC-3′, were designed, and mouse SGIP1α cDNA was obtained by PCR using mouse cDNA as a template. Rat Eps15 cDNA was obtained by PCR using rat brain cDNA as a template (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank™ accession number AB262963). Expression vectors were constructed in pGex5X-3 (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.), pMal C2 (New England Biolabs), pEGFP-C1 (Clontech), and pCMV-Myc (19Nakanishi H. Obaishi H. Satoh A. Wada M.

SGIP1α-1 (aa 1-280), SGIP1α-2 (aa 261-580), SGIP1α-3 (aa 561-854), SGIP1α-4 (aa 1-97), SGIP1α-5 (aa 98-280), SGIP1α-6 (aa 251-390), SGIP1α-7 (aa 428-854), and rat Eps15 (aa 593-834) were obtained by PCR. SGIP1α mutant (T2001C, C2004G, G2007A, A2010G, and C2013T) was generated using the site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) without changing the aa sequence. GST fusion and MBP fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.) and amylose resin beads (New England Biolabs Inc.), respectively.Abs—A rabbit pAb against SGIP1α was raised against GST-SGIP1α-6 (aa 251-390). The antiserum was affinity-purified with the fusion protein covalently coupled to N-hydroxysuccinimidyl-activated Sepharose (GE Healthcare Bio-Science Corp.). The following Abs were purchased from commercial sources: mouse anti-Myc mAb (9E10) (American Type Culture Collection); mouse anti-tubulin α mAb (clone DM1A) (Sigma-Aldrich); rabbit anti-EGFP pAb and mouse anti-EGFP mAb (MBL Co.); mouse anti-α adaptin mAb, mouse anti-γ adaptin mAb, and mouse anti-Eps15 mAb (BD Biosciences); rabbit anti-Eps15 pAb (Covance); and secondary Abs conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (Invitrogen).Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min, and immunostained with various Abs. DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen) staining was performed as described (20Kamioka Y. Fukuhara S. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Masuda M. Matsuda M. Mochizuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 40091-40099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope (BX51, Olympus) or a confocal microscopy system (BX50 and Fluoview FV300; Olympus) at room temperature. The fluorochromes used included Alexa Fluor 488 and 594, Texas-red conjugated EGF, and DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) (Invitrogen). A ×60 oil immersion objective, NA 1.40 (Olympus) was used. Images were assembled with PhotoShop (Adobe). In each plate, photographs were cropped, and each fluorochrome was adjusted for identical brightness and contrast to represent the observed images.The quantification of colocalization was performed using Meta-Morph imaging system software (21Murph M.M. Scaccia L.A. Volpicelli L.A. Radhakrishna H. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116,: 1969-1980Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, background was subtracted from unprocessed images, and the percentage of SGIP1α pixels overlapping Eps15, α-adaptin, or EGF pixels was measured. For the colocalization in the plasma membrane region, images were acquired to display the entire cell surface adhering to culture dishes (22Puri C. Tosoni D. Comai R. Rabellino A. Segat D. Caneva F. Luzzi P. Di Fiore P.P. Tacchetti C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16,: 2704-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The colocalization percentage was determined in a restricted region of the images extending 15 pixels from the cell edge toward the cytoplasm. For the colocalization in the intracellular region, images were acquired at upper planes from the ventral surface. The colocalization percentage was determined in a region of the images excluding 15 pixels from the cell edge. Data were shown as the means + S.E. of three independent experiments.Liposome Binding and Liposome Tubulation Assays—Liposome binding assay was performed as described (12Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172,: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). PE/PC liposomes consisted of 70% PE, 20% PC, and 10% PI or various phosphoinositides. Where indicated, liposomes consisted of 80% PE, 20% PC, and various percentages of PS (with a corresponding reduction in PE). MBP-SGIP1α-4 (50 μg/ml) was incubated with 1 mg/ml liposomes for 15 min at room temperature followed by centrifugation. To calculate the Kd value, various doses of GST-SGIP1α-4 were incubated with 0.2 mg/ml liposomes (60% PE, 20% PC, and 20% PI(4,5)P2) for 30 min at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Comparable amounts of the supernatant and pellet fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining. The protein amount was quantified by scanning using NIH image (version 1.61). Liposome tubulation assay was carried out as described (12Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172,: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar).In Vitro Binding Assays and Immunoprecipitation—To examine the in vitro binding of SGIP1α to Eps15, MBP-Eps15 or MBP alone (200 pmol each) was incubated with GST-SGIP1α-3 or GST alone (200 pmol each) immobilized on beads in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100. After washing, bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by CBB staining.Immunoprecipitation was performed as follows. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm NaF, 1.5 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A) followed by centrifugation. The supernatant (1 mg of protein) was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-SGIP1α pAb or control rabbit IgG. Protein G-Sepharose beads were added to the sample, which was further incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After the beads were thoroughly washed with the same buffer, bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis.RNAi—Stealth double-stranded RNAs were purchased from Invitrogen. The sequence of siRNA specific to SGIP1α was 5′-UUU ACC CAG AAU UCC UUG GUA UUG G-3′ (corresponding nucleotide 1997-2021 relative to the start codon). A double-stranded RNA targeting luciferase (5′-CGU ACG CGG AAU ACU UCG AAA UGU C-3′) was used as a control. N1E115 cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, a second transfection was performed, and the cells were cultured for 72 h and subjected to various experiments.Endocytosis Assays—Endocytosis in COS7 cells was assayed using fluorescent ligands as described (12Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172,: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 20Kamioka Y. Fukuhara S. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Masuda M.

Briefly, cells were starved with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 2 h and incubated with 25 μg/ml Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated Tfn (Invitrogen) or 20 ng/ml Texas red-conjugated, biotinylated EGF (Invitrogen) for 10 min at 37 °C. After acid stripping, cells were fixed with formaldehyde. The average intensity of internalized ligands per cell area was determined using MetaMorph imaging system software (23Strachan L.R. Condic M.L. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 167,: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Endocytosis assays in N1E115 cells using radioactive ligands were performed as described (24Subtil A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18,: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Briefly, cells were starved for 2 h and incubated with 10 nm 125I-labeled Tfn (PerkinElmer) or 1.5 ng/ml 125I-labeled EGF (PerkinElmer) for the indicated periods of time at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Internalized and surface radioactivity was quantified by a gamma counter. Nonspecific binding was measured for each time point in the presence of 100-fold molar excess of the same unlabeled ligand.Other Procedures—Tubulin was prepared from fresh porcine brains as described (26Shelanski M.L. Gaskin F. Cantor C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70,: 765-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar, 27Jr. Williams R.C. Lee J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 85,: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid library constructed from adult rat brain cDNA was screened using pBTM116HA-SGIP1α-7 (aa 428-854) as bait as described (28Shimizu K. Kawabe H. Minami S. Honda T. Takaishi K.

Protein concentrations were performed with bovine serum albumin as a reference protein (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72,: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227,: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar).RESULTSIdentification of p100 as a Tubulin-binding Protein—To detect tubulin- and/or MT-binding proteins, we performed tubulin blot overlay. When various rat tissue homogenates were subjected to blot overlay, several bands with various molecular masses were detected (Fig. 1A). Of these protein bands, a thick band of about 100 kDa (p100) was detected only in the brain. By successive column chromatographies, p100 was copurified with another band of about 110 kDa (p110) (supplemental Fig. 1). These protein bands were separately excised out from the gels, digested with trypsin, and subjected to mass spectrometry. From the p100 protein band, four peptide sequences were obtained (supplemental Fig. 2A). A data base search revealed that the peptide sequences of p100 were identical to those of a mouse hypothetical protein (GenBank accession number BC017596). p110 was found to be CLIP-115, a brain-specific MT-binding protein (32De Zeeuw C.I. Hoogenraad C.C. Goedknegt E. Hertzberg E. Neubauer A. Grosveld F. Galjart N. Neuron. 1997; 19,: 1187-1199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We performed PCR to amplify cDNA of the hypothetical protein using mouse brain cDNA as a template. Our cloned cDNA encoded a protein that consisted of 854 aa and showed a calculated molecular weight of 91,719 (DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession number AB262964) (supplemental Fig. 2A). This protein contained a proline-rich domain in the middle region, whereas it did not possess any conserved domains in the N-terminal or C-terminal region (see Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2Membrane tubulation by SGIP1α overexpression.A, the N-terminal region (aa 1-97, MP domain) responsible for the formation of tubular structures. Upper panel, structures of full-length SGIP1α and various fragments of SGIP1α. Lower panel, COS7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-SGIP1α (full-length), pEGFP-SGIP1α-1 (aa 1-280), pEGFP-SGIP1α-2 (aa 261-580), pEGFP-SGIP1α-3 (aa 561-854), pEGFP-SGIP1α-4 (aa 1-97, MP domain), or pEGFP-SGIP1α-5(aa 98-280). Cells were examined with a fluorescence microscope. Scale bars, 10 μm. B, origination of tubular structures from the plasma membrane. COS7 cells transfected with pEGFP-SGIP1α-4 (MP domain) were fixed without permeabilization and then stained with DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Samples were examined with a fluorescence microscope. Insets, enlarged images of dashed boxes. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)During the study, the mouse hypothetical protein was found to be a recently reported neuronal protein, named SGIP1 (14Trevaskis J. Walder K. Foletta V. Kerr-Bayles L. McMillan J. Cooper A. Lee S. Bolton K. Prior M. Fahey R. Whitecross K. Morton G.J. Schwartz M.W. Collier G.R. Endocrinology. 2005; 146,: 3757-3764Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). When the aa sequences of our clone and SGIP1 were aligned, they showed 94% identity (supplemental Fig. 2A). Our clone had two inserted peptide sequences at its N-terminal and middle regions. It is likely that our clone is a longer splicing variant of SGIP1; therefore, the protein encoded by our clone was named SGIP1α. To confirm whether SGIP1α is detected by tubulin blot overlay, we expressed a Myc-tagged protein in COS7 cells. Myc-tagged SGIP1α was detected by blot overlay (Fig. 1B).Membrane Tubulation by SGIP1α Overexpression—To examine the binding of SGIP1α to tubulin and/or MTs in intact cells, we examined the subcellular distribution of SGIP1α. When transiently expressed at a high level in COS7 cells, EGFP-SGIP1α (full-length) showed short tubular structures (Fig. 2A). EGFP-SGIP1α-1 (aa 1-280) and -4 (aa 1-97) also showed tubular structures, whereas other fragments, including EGFP-SGIP1α-2 (aa 261-580), -3 (aa 561-854), and -5 (aa 98-280), did not. These results indicate that the N-terminal region (aa 1-97) of SGIP1α is responsible for the formation of tubular structures. These structures appeared to be different from those of MTs but were reminiscent of those recently reported to be formed by phospholipid-binding BAR and EFC domains (11Itoh T. Erdmann K.S. Roux A. Habermann B. Werner H. De Camilli P. Dev. Cell. 2005; 9,: 791-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 12Tsujita K. Suetsugu S. Sasaki N. Furutani M. Oikawa T. Takenawa T. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172,: 269-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 20Kamioka Y. Fukuhara S. Sawa H. Nagashima K. Masuda M. Matsuda M. Mochizuki N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279,: 40091-40099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). To examine the possibility that the N-terminal region (aa 1-97) binds to the plasma membrane and deforms it into tubules, COS7 cells overexpressing EGFP-SGIP1α-4 (aa 1-97) were stained with DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) is a lipophilic fluorescent probe used for plasma membrane staining (33Mukherjee S. Maxfield F.R. Traffic. 2000; 1,: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The tubular structures of EGFP-SGIP1α-4 were completely overlapped with DiIC16 (3Slepnev V.I. De Camilli P. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1,: 161-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar) staining (Fig. 2B). This result indicates that tubular structures originate from the plasma membrane. It remains elusive whether SGIP1α binds to tubulin and/or MTs in intact cells. Based on the observation that the N-terminal region (aa 1-97) of SGIP1α binds to membrane phospholipids as described below, we named this region the MP (membrane phospholipid-binding) domain, which shows no significant homology to any proteins in the current protein data base.Direct Binding of SGIP1α to Phospholipids—To examine whether the MP domain directly interacts with membrane phospholipids in vitro, we performed liposome cosedimentation assay. Although MBP-SGIP1α-4 (MP domain) did not bind to synthetic liposomes composed of PE and PC, it strongly bound to liposomes containing PS, PI 3-phosphate, PI 4-phosphate, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, PI 3,5-bisphosphate, or PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3A). The MP domain faintly bound to liposomes containing PI, PI 5-phosphate, or PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate. The percentage of PS in liposomes for maximal binding was about 10%. The MP domain bound to brain lipids (Folch fraction) rich in PS (about 50% of total lipids). This binding specificity of the MP domain is similar to that of the FBP17 EFC domain (11Itoh T.

https://openalex.org/W1974652786,"SSeCKS (Src-suppressed C kinase substrate), also called gravin/AKAP12, is a large scaffolding protein with metastasis suppressor activity. Two major isoforms of SSeCKS are expressed in most cell and tissue types under the control of two independent promoters, designated α and β, separated by 68 kb. SSeCKS transcript and protein levels are severely decreased in Src- and Ras-transformed fibroblasts and in many epithelial tumors. By dissecting its promoters with progressive deletion analysis, we identified the sequence between –106 and –49 in the α proximal promoter as the minimal v-Src-responsive element, which contains E- and GC-boxes bound by USF1 and Sp1/Sp3, respectively. Both E- and GC-boxes are crucial for v-Src-responsive and basal promoter activities. v-Src does not alter USF1 binding levels at the E-box, but it increases Sp1/Sp3 binding to the GC-box despite no change in their cellular protein abundance. SSeCKS α and β transcript levels in v-Src/3T3 cells can be restored by treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, but not with the DNA demethylation agent, 5-azacytidine. Chromatin changes are found only on the α promoter even though the β proximal promoter contains a similar E- and GC-box arrangement. Recruitment of HDAC1 is necessary and sufficient to cause repression of α proximal promoter activity, and the addition of Sp1 and/or Sp3 potentiates the repression. Our data suggest that suppression of the β promoter is facilitated by Src-induced changes in the α promoter chromatinization mediated by a USF1-Sp1-Sp3 complex. SSeCKS (Src-suppressed C kinase substrate), also called gravin/AKAP12, is a large scaffolding protein with metastasis suppressor activity. Two major isoforms of SSeCKS are expressed in most cell and tissue types under the control of two independent promoters, designated α and β, separated by 68 kb. SSeCKS transcript and protein levels are severely decreased in Src- and Ras-transformed fibroblasts and in many epithelial tumors. By dissecting its promoters with progressive deletion analysis, we identified the sequence between –106 and –49 in the α proximal promoter as the minimal v-Src-responsive element, which contains E- and GC-boxes bound by USF1 and Sp1/Sp3, respectively.

Our data suggest that suppression of the β promoter is facilitated by Src-induced changes in the α promoter chromatinization mediated by a USF1-Sp1-Sp3 complex. SSeCKS (Src-suppressed C kinase substrate) was originally identified in a screen for genes severely down-regulated by v-Src (1Frankfort B.J. Gelman I.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 916-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and then characterized as a major in vitro and in vivo substrate of protein kinase C (2Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Ross M. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28,430-28,438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar). SSeCKS is the rodent orthologue of human gravin, a kinase scaffold protein originally discovered as an autoantigen in some myasthenia gravis patients (3Nauert J. Klauck T. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 4Gordon T. Grove B. Loftus J.C. O'Toole T. McMillan R. Lindstrom J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Clin. Investig. 1992; 90: 992-999Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on their ability to bind protein kinase A RII isoforms (3Nauert J. Klauck T. Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 52-62Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), SSeCKS and gravin have been re-designated AKAP12 (A kinase anchoring protein 12). In addition to protein kinase A and protein kinase C, SSeCKS also binds with calmodulin, cyclin D1, β-adrenergic receptor, β-1,4 galactosyltransferase, and F-actin (5Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1797Google Scholar). With its ability to scaffold key signaling and cytoskeletal proteins, SSeCKS plays important roles in regulating G1 → S phase transition and cytoskeletal organization (6Lin X. Nelson P. Gelman I.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7259-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 7Gelman I.H. Lee K. Tombler E. Gordon R. Lin X. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1998; 41: 1-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Additionally, several lines of evidence suggest that SSeCKS/gravin/AKAP12 (heretofore called “SSeCKS”) functions as a suppressor of tumorigenesis and metastasis. The expression of SSeCKS is down-regulated by several oncogenes and in various human epithelial tumors, including prostate, breast, ovarian, gastric, and lung (8Xia W. Unger P. Miller L. Nelson J.

The locus of human GRAVIN gene in chromosome 6q24–25.2 is a deletion hotspot in advanced prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers (8Xia W. Unger P. Miller L. Nelson J. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 2001; 15: 5644-5651Google Scholar, 14Wan M. Sun T. Vyas R. Zheng J. Granada E. Dubeau L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1545-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, SSeCKS re-expression in Src-transformed fibroblasts can reverse Src-induced oncogenic growth by reducing anchorage-independent proliferation and inhibiting metastatic invasiveness through the suppression of podosome formation, most likely via the reestablishment of normal cytoskeletal architecture and the suppression of Rho family GTPase activity (15Lin X. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2304-2312PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gelman I.H. Gao L. Mol. Cancer Res. 2006; 4: 150-158Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The re-expression of SSeCKS in rat Mat-LyLu prostate cancer cells slightly reduces the growth rate of primary subcutaneous tumors in nude mice but greatly suppresses the formation of lung metastases by decreasing angiogenesis through the inhibition of expression of pro-angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (17Su B. Zheng Q. Vaughan M.M. Bu Y. Gelman I.H. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5599-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The SSeCKS gene locus in human and rodents encodes three major transcripts under the control of three independent promoters, designated α, β, and γ, that are separated by 84 kb (5Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1797Google Scholar, 18Streb J.W. Kitchen C.M. Gelman I.H. Miano J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56014-56023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two major protein isoforms of SSeCKS, α and β, are expressed ubiquitously in most cell and tissue types (5Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1797Google Scholar), whereas the expression of isoform γ is testes-restricted (19Camus A. Mesbah K. Rallu M. Babinet C. Barra J. Mech.

Biochem. 1999; 263: 797-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). All proteins encoded by each transcript share >95% amino acid sequence identity encoded by a single large exon but differ only at their extreme N-terminal residues. For example, only the α isoform encodes a product that is myristoylated (2Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Ross M. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28,430-28,438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and this modification facilitates α SSeCKS association with plasma membranes and vesicles of the endoplasmic reticulum (7Gelman I.H.

Chem. 2006; 281: 23932-23944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which SSeCKS is down-regulated in tumor cells has not been studied. The fact that SSeCKS is down-regulated by some oncogenes (Src, Ras, Myc, and Jun) but not by others (Raf, Mos, or Neu) suggests that this is not a generic effect in transformed cells but rather is controlled by specific mitogenic and oncogenic pathways (5Gelman I.H. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: 1797Google Scholar). Given that down-regulation of SSeCKS is not a bystander effect during oncogenic transformation, understanding the molecular mechanism involved in SSeCKS gene silencing in the course of tumorigenesis will contribute to control tumor progression by means to reactivate SSeCKS expression. In this study, we dissect the cis- and trans-factors responsible for the v-Src-induced repression of ssecks promoters. We find that the minimal v-Src-responsive element (VSRE) 2The abbreviations used are:VSREv-Src-responsive element5-aza-C5-azacytidineAc-H3/H4acetylated histone H3/H4AKAPA kinase anchoring proteinChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseHDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatin ATSStranscription start siteVSRv-Src-responsiveAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolHAhemagglutininRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAWTwild typeTKthymidine kinase requires both E- and GC-boxes in the SSeCKS α proximal promoter (–106 to –49), which are bound by the transcription factors USF1 and Sp1/3, respectively. Our data indicate that v-Src-mediated transcriptional repression correlates with increased complex formation between USF1 and Sp1/3, increased binding activity of Sp1/3 to the α SSeCKS VSRE, and the recruitment of HDAC1. Moreover, although the mouse and human α and β promoters share E- and GC-boxes in their proximal promoter, our data suggest that suppression of the β promoter is facilitated by chromatin structure change in the α promoter 68 kb upstream. v-Src-responsive element 5-azacytidine acetylated histone H3/H4 A kinase anchoring protein chromatin immunoprecipitation electrophoretic mobility shift assay extracellular signal-regulated kinase histone deacetylase trichostatin A transcription start site v-Src-responsive antibody monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol hemagglutinin reverse transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase small interfering RNA wild type thymidine kinase Cell Culture—NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine serum. v-Src-transformed NIH3T3 cells (v-Src/3T3) were generated by retrovirus-mediated transduction. Briefly, pBabe-v-Src/puro DNA was transfected into the 293GPG packaging cell line (23Ory D.S. Neugeboren B.A. Mulligan R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11400-11406Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Virus was harvested 72 h after transfection and used to infect NIH3T3 cells (104/well in 12-well dishes) for 4 h. Cells were maintained in selection medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma). Single colonies with transformed cell morphology were picked and expanded, and then the expression of oncogenic v-Src was verified by Western blot with anti-v-Src (avian) mAb EC10, anti-Src[poY416] (BIOSOURCE), and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb-4G10 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA) antibodies. v-Src/3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine serum and 2 μg/ml puromycin. Immunofluorescence Staining—NIH3T3 or v-Src/3T3 cells grown to 60% confluence on 22-mm coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for another 10 min. After rinsing with PBS, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (1:500 dilution) (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. After three PBS washes, coverslips were mounted on glass slides in ProLong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Fluorescent images were captured using a Nikon TE2000-E inverted microscope (Garden City, NY). Primer Extension Analysis—Total RNA from NIH3T3 cells was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. A 32P-end-labeled antisense primer (for SSeCKS α,5′-AGGAGATGTGCGCCCAGGACCACAGG-3′; for SSeCKS β,5′-CCTTCTCCTCTGTCTACTCCCGGCTAACC-3′) corresponding to +66/+91 or +72/+101 relative to the transcriptional start site of SSeCKS α or β, respectively, was hybridized at 58 °C overnight with 50 μg of total RNA (previously denatured for 3 min at 90 °C). The annealed primer was extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 °C for 1 h. The sizes of the extension products were determined by electrophoresis on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea. A 10-bp 32P-labeled ladder and sequencing reaction performed with the same primer on a genomic clone was used as a reference. The gel was dried, and the radioactive signals were identified by phosphorimaging (Storm-860, GE Healthcare). Reporter Constructs—The SSeCKS α promoter sequence (–4920/+36) and β promoter sequence (–4758/+119) were amplified from the BAC clone (RP11-27244) using the Triple-Master long run PCR system (Eppendorf, Westbury, NY) and then ligated into pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). The MluI/XhoI fragments from these plasmids were subcloned into the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison WI) cut with MluI/XhoI. Progressive deletion mutants of SSeCKS promoter-luciferase constructs were created by inverse PCR with promoter-specific, MluI-flanked primers (Table 1), using the ∼5-kb SSeCKS promoter/luciferase constructs as templates, followed by self-ligation. All constructs were validated by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1PCR primersForward primerReverse primerSSeCKS α promoter-4920/+36GACAAGTTCAGCCTGCTCTTCCCACGATCCTGCTGAGAACAC-3239/+36CCGACGCGTATGCATTAGAAGAGGGCGTTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-2677/+36CCGACGCGTTTCGAGACAGGGTTTCTCTGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-1455/+36CCGACGCGCGTGCTAGCCTGAACTAGATTGTGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-636/+36CCGACGCGTCCCGGGGAAAGAGGGCGGCGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-270/+36CCGACGCGTTGCTGCTCCTGAACCTTCTGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-106/+36CCGACGCGTTGCTCATGTGATGAAGGGAGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-89/+36CCGACGCGTGAGGGAAAACAAGGAGGGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-67/+36CCGACGCGTAGAGGCTACGAGGTGGCTTTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-43/+36CCGACGCGTTTTTTTTTTTCTTTTAAGGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-26/+36CCGACGCGTAGGAGTTGCCACGTAGCGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGCSSeCKS β promoter-4758/+119TGTGCACATTACGCATGGAGGCTCTTACGGCAGGAAGTCTCC-2482/+119CCGACGCGTTGGGAGAGACTCATGTAGCCTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-551/+119CCGACGCGTCCACGAAAAGTAGAGAGACCTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-157/+119CCGACGCGTAGACCAGGCACAGAGACCAGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC-24+119CCGACGCGTAGCCAGAGAAGCGCTTCTCCTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGC+16/+119CCGACGCGTCCAGGGCTGGAGAGCTTCCTTGTGCATAGCTTGAGTATTCTAACGCSSeCKS α -106/+36 mutagenesisaMutated nucleotides are indicated in italics.MutE-boxCTTACGCCGCGTTGTTCAAATGATGAAGGCCTTCATCATTTGAACAACGCGGCGTAAGMutGC-boxGAAAAACAAGTAGGTGGCAGGAGGCTACGCGTAGCCTCCTGCCACCTACTTGTTTTTCSSeCKS-TK heterologous promoterbRestriction enzyme sites are underlined.Minimal TKCCGATGCTCGAGCAGCGTCTTGTCATTGGCGAGGATAAAGCTTTTAAGCGGGTCGCTGCAGGSSeCKS -106/-49TCGATAGGTACCGAGCTCTTACGCCCGATGCTCGAGAGCCACCTCGTAGCCTCCRT-PCRSSeCKS αAAGAATGGTCAGCTGTCTGCTGACAGTGAGTAGCTGGACGSSeCKS βAGGAGAAGGAGACTTCCTGCTGACAGTGAGTAGCTGGACGSSeCKS α+βTAATGGAAGTGGCCAGATGTCTGCAATCTGCTTTGTCTTGGβ-ActinTTCTTTGCAGCTCCTTCGTTGCCGTGGATGGCTACGTACATGGCTGGGMS Sequenomcprimers used after bisulfite treatment.SSeCKS αTAATTAAGTGGAGGAAGAAAATAGATAGGTAAAAATTCAAAAACAACAAAAAAAAa Mutated nucleotides are indicated in italics.b Restriction enzyme sites are underlined.c primers used after bisulfite treatment. Open table in a new tab Promoter/reporter constructs with mutations in the E-box and/or GC-box were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX) according to manufacturer's instructions, using the –106/+36 α SSeCKS reporter construct as template. Nucleotide changes are indicated in italics for each primer (Table 1). All reporter mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the SSeCKS-TK heterologous promoter constructs, a minimal TK promoter sequence was amplified from pRL-TK (Promega) with XhoI- or HindIII-flanked primers (Table 1). The PCR products were digested with XhoI/HindIII and cloned into pGL3-Basic vector cut with XhoI/HindIII to create the TKm-pGL3B luciferase reporter plasmid. The wild type SSeCKS α proximal promoter sequence between –106 and –49 and proximal promoters containing mutated E-Box and/or GC-Box were amplified with the KpnI- or XhoI-flanked primers (Table 1), digested with KpnI and XhoI, and inserted into TKm-pGL3B plasmid cut with KpnI/XhoI. Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 and v-Src/3T3 cells with or without treatment of fresh 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C) (500 nm for 72 h) and/or trichostatin A (TSA) (330 nm for 24 h) (Sigma) using TRIzol (Invitrogen). 1 μg of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription using SuperScript first-strand synthesis system kit (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR was then performed using MJ Research PTC-200 DNA thermal cycler (Watertown, MA) with the optimized cycle numbers for each primer set (Table 1). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through a 1.5% agarose gel and digitally imaged using a Chemi-Genius 2The abbreviations used are:VSREv-Src-responsive element5-aza-C5-azacytidineAc-H3/H4acetylated histone H3/H4AKAPA kinase anchoring proteinChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayERKextracellular signal-regulated kinaseHDAChistone deacetylaseTSAtrichostatin ATSStranscription start siteVSRv-Src-responsiveAbantibodymAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salinePMSFphenylmethylsulfonyl fluorideDTTdithiothreitolHAhemagglutininRTreverse transcriptionGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenasesiRNAsmall interfering RNAWTwild typeTKthymidine kinase Bio-Imager (Syngene, Frederick, MD). v-Src-responsive element 5-azacytidine acetylated histone H3/H4 A kinase anchoring protein chromatin immunoprecipitation electrophoretic mobility shift assay extracellular signal-regulated kinase histone deacetylase trichostatin A transcription start site v-Src-responsive antibody monoclonal antibody phosphate-buffered saline phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride dithiothreitol hemagglutinin reverse transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase small interfering RNA wild type thymidine kinase mRNA Stability Analysis—NIH3T3 and v-Src/3T3 cells (2 × 105) seeded in 35-cm dishes were harvested at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h after addition of actinomycin D (5 μg/ml) (Sigma). Total cellular RNA was extracted, and RT-PCR was performed as described above. Because the endogenous SSeCKS mRNA levels are suppressed in v-Src/3T3 cells, the PCR cycle numbers for SSeCKS α were 30 for NIH3T3 cells and 38 for v-Src/3T3 cells; for SSeCKS β were 29 for NIH3T3 cells and 34 for v-Src/3T3 cells; and for the shared α/β sequence were 28 for NIH3T3 cells and 32 for v-Src/3T3 cells. Western Blot Analysis—Whole cell lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) with freshly added inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4) and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in TBST (150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20), or with 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST for phosphoprotein blots. The following primary antibodies were used as indicated: anti-SSeCKS (2Lin X. Tombler E. Nelson P.J. Ross M. Gelman I.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28,430-28,438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (127) Google Scholar), anti-v-Src mAb EC10 (gift of Sarah Parsons, University of Virginia), anti-Src[poY416] (BIOSOURCE), anti-phosphotyrosine mAb-4G10 (Upstate), anti-FLAG and anti-actin clone AC40 (Sigma), anti-GAPDH, anti-lamin A/C, anti-USF1, anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, anti-HDAC1, anti-HDAC2, anti-HDAC3, anti-PIAS1, and anti-HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). After washing and incubating with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit or -mouse IgG secondary antibodies, the blots were washed, incubated with Lumi-Light chemiluminescence reagent (Roche Applied Science), and digitally imaged using a Chemi-Genius2 Bio-Imager. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For reporter assays, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 3 × 104 cells/well 24 h prior to transfection. Each transfection was performed in triplicate with 0.2 μg of promoter/reporter constructs along with 0.1 μgof Renilla luciferase reporter pRL-TK (Promega), used to normalize for transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and lysed, and luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase assay kits (Promega). For overexpression experiments, a set amount of the SSeCKS α proximal promoter-reporter construct (–106/+36) was transfected in combination with various expression plasmids as indicated. The total amount of DNA transfected was normalized using the appropriate empty vectors. Data presented are representative of at least three independent experiments. The Sp1 expression vector (pFLAG-Sp1-HA) was a generous gift from Dr. Adrian Black (Roswell Park Cancer Institute). Expression vectors of pCMV-Sp3 and pN3-PIAS1, encoding a SUMO ligase, were kind gifts from Professor Guntram Suske (Institute für Molekularbiologie and Tumorforschung, Marburg, Germany). The expression vector for HA tagged SUMO-1 cDNA (HA-Sen1) was a gift kindly provided by Dr. Edward T. H. Yeh (University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The HA-tagged HDAC1 expression plasmid (pCMV-2N3T-HDAC1) was a generous gift from Dr. Didier Trouche (Université Paul Sabatier, France). Preparation of Nuclear Extracts—Nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (24Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells growing in 10-cm dishes (80–90% confluence) were washed twice with cold PBS and scraped into 1.5 ml of PBS. Cells were collected by centrifuging at 2,000 rpm for 2 min and then resuspending in 1 ml of ice-cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm PMSF, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture). After incubating on ice for 20 min, the cells were homogenized with a glass Dounce (type A) by applying 30 strokes. Nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of buffer C (20 mm HEPES pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1mm PMSF, and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional agitation. The nuclear extract was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored in aliquots at –80 °C. Protein concentrations of nuclear extracts were determined using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—All DNA oligonucleotides used for EMSA were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Oligonucleotides were annealed, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and purified by passage through Sephadex G-50 micro-columns (Amersham Biosciences). For each reaction, 5 μgof nuclear extract was preincubated with 1.5 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma) for 20 min on ice in 10 μl of binding buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm PMSF, 10% glycerol). 0.2 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (∼20,000 cpm) was added to the 10-μl reaction mixtures and incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and then electrophoresed on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer run at 4 °C. The gels were sandwiched with Whatman 3M paper, dried, and then autoradiographed overnight with an intensifying screen. In competition or supershift assays, molar excess amounts of unlabeled DNA probe or 2 μgof antibody were added to the preincubation mixtures 20 min or 1 h, respectively, prior to the addition of 32P-labeled DNA oligonucleotides. DNA Affinity Precipitation Assay—Nuclear extracts (100 μg) from NIH3T3 or v-Src/3T3 cells were incubated at room temperature for 15 min with 0.5 nmol of 5′-biotinylated double-stranded oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies), which were previously conjugated to streptavidin-agarose beads (Sigma), in 300 μl of low salt lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 mm PMSF and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture. The beads were then washed six times with low salt lysis buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and boiled in 1× electrophoresis sample buffer to elute the bound proteins before running on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and immunoblotted with antibodies against HDAC1 and USF1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assays were performed following the protocol outlined by the manufacturer (Upstate) with minor modifications. Briefly, NIH3T3 and v-Src/3T3 cells growing in 10-cm dishes (80–90% confluence) were fixed in culture medium with formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) for 10 min at 37 °C. After washing twice with cold PBS, cells were collected by centrifuging at 2,000 rpm for 2 min, resuspended in 0.8 ml of SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) containing 1 mm PMSF and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture, and incubated for 20 min on ice. DNA was sheared into ∼200–1000-bp fragments by five 20-s sonications, followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm at 4 °C to remove debris. Supernatant fractions were diluted 5-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl) containing 1 mm PMSF and Roche Applied Science protease inhibitor mixture. Each chromatin fraction (1.2 ml per immunoprecipitation) was precleared with 60 μlof salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads (Upstate) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated at 4 °C overnight with 5 μgofthe following antibodies as indicated: anti-USF1, anti-Sp1, anti-Sp3, and normal rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetyl-histone H4 and anti-acetyl-histone H3 (Upstate). Immune complexes were isolated by binding to 40 μl of salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, and by washing sequentially with low salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl), and then twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). DNA-protein complexes were eluted twice with 250 μlof 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-linking. Proteins were digested with proteinase K, and DNA was recovered by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation with 20 μgof glycog"
https://openalex.org/W2005227262,"Cyanobacteria account for a significant percentage of aquatic primary productivity even in areas where the concentrations of essential micronutrients are extremely low. To better understand the mechanism of iron selectivity and transport, the structure of the solute binding domain of an ATP binding cassette iron transporter, FutA1, was determined in the presence and absence of iron. The iron ion is bound within the “C-clamp” structure via four tyrosine and one histidine residues. There are extensive interactions between these ligating residues and the rest of the protein such that the conformations of the side chains remain relatively unchanged as the iron is released by the opening of the metal binding cleft. This is in stark contrast to the zinc-binding protein, ZnuA, where the domains of the metal-binding protein remain relatively fixed, whereas the ligating residues rotate out of the binding pocket upon metal release. The rotation of the domains in FutA1 is facilitated by two flexible β-strands running along the back of the protein that act like a hinge during domain motion. This motion may require relatively little energy since total contact area between the domains is the same whether the protein is in the open or closed conformation. Consistent with the pH dependence of iron binding, the main trigger for iron release is likely the histidine in the iron-binding site. Finally, neither FutA1 nor FutA2 binds iron as a siderophore complex or in the presence of anions, and both preferentially bind ferrous over ferric ions.

Finally, neither FutA1 nor FutA2 binds iron as a siderophore complex or in the presence of anions, and both preferentially bind ferrous over ferric ions. Bioavailable iron is a limiting nutrient for primary production in large areas of the oceans. This concentration of free iron in aquatic environments is dynamic and varies greatly depending upon the local environment. Fe3+ is notoriously insoluble in water at neutral pH values, whereas Fe2+ is very soluble but highly susceptible to oxidation by atmospheric oxygen. Microbes play a large role in the cycling of iron between the ferric and ferrous forms and generally reduce ferric iron under anaerobic conditions by using it as a final electron acceptor. Conversely, microbes can oxidize ferrous iron under aerobic conditions when other compounds such as nitrate are the final electron acceptors. Organisms can import either form of iron. A number of bacteria, algae, and Cyanobacteria increase the bioavailability of ferric iron through the secretion of organic molecules, such as siderophores, into the extracellular environment. These compounds have exceptionally high binding affinities for iron (association constants of ∼1019 m-1) and essentially scavenge ferric iron from the extracellular environment before the organism imports the entire complex into the cell (e.g. Ref. 1Ferguson A.D. Hofmann E. Coulton J.W. Diederichs K. Welte W. Science. 1998; 282: 2215-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar). In some cases these siderophores may actually facilitate a photochemical reduction of the bound ferric ion (2Borer P.M. Sulzberger B. Reichard P. Kraemer S.M. Mar. Chem. 2005; 93: 179-193Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Alternatively, ferric iron can be locally reduced to the more soluble ferrous form and imported directly. This latter can be accomplished by the organisms itself as is the case with some algal species that use ferric chelate reductase to reduce the iron before import or via a symbiotic organism such as bacteria associated with the roots of freshwater and marine macrophytes that reduce ferric iron in the rhizosphere (3King G.M. Garey M.A. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 4393-4398Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria have evolved ATP binding cassette-type transport systems for the high affinity uptake of transition metal ions such as iron, manganese, and zinc, particularly at low extracellular levels of these metals (4Bartsevich V.V. Pakrasi H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26057-26061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Hantke K. Biometals. 2001; 14: 239-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 6Claverys J.P. Res. Microbiol. 2001; 152: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The ATP binding cassette-type binding proteins from a number of bacteria have been grouped into clusters on the basis of their sequence homologies and the metal ligand identities (7Bouige P. Laurent D. Piloyan L. Dassa E. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2002; 3: 541-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Synechocystis 6803, the futA1 (slr1295) and futA2 (slr0513) genes encode periplasmic-binding proteins that have been proposed to be part of a high affinity iron transport system. Before in vitro studies with purified FutA1 expressed as a GST2 fusion protein in Escherichia coli suggested that the protein binds ferric iron with an association constant of about 1 × 1019 m-1 (8Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Similarly, in Synechocystis 6803 mutants in which futA1 and futA2 were deleted, iron uptake was reduced to 37 and 84%, respectively, compared with wild type (8Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). When both genes were deleted, the resulting iron uptake activity was less than 5% that of wild type. Because high concentrations of citrate inhibited iron uptake, it was concluded that the iron was not being transported as a ferric citrate complex. These results suggested that there was at least some redundancy in the functions of FutA1 and FutA2. Recently, it was shown that FutA2 binds iron with approximately the same relative affinity as FutA1 (9Waldron K.J. Tottey S. Yanagisawa S. Dennison C. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3837-3846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, when futA2 is deleted, the mutants accumulate normal levels of iron-containing ferredoxin in the periplasm but fail to accumulate copper in plastocyanin. This result combined with the fact that Synechocystis 6803 expresses FutA2 to high levels led to the conclusion that it might not be directly involved in iron transport but, instead, sequesters iron in the periplasm and acts as a metallochaperone. As so, they suggested that it might assist in iron import as well as prevent these ions from competing with other metal binding periplasmic proteins such as those which bind copper. Here we report the high resolution structure of FutA1 in the presence and absence of bound iron. FutA1 has a C-clamp structure that is very similar to that of Campylobacter jejuni (10Tom-Yew S.A.L. Cui D.T. Bekker E.G. Murphy M.E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9283-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and binds iron via four tyrosine and one histidine residues in the absence of anions or siderophores. Upon release of the bound iron, the two domains of the protein rotate about two β-strands running along the back of the protein. There are extensive interactions between the chelating residues and the rest of the protein such that these residues remain in a relatively fixed conformation upon the release of iron and the opening of the iron-binding site via domain movement. From analysis of the changes in the contact surface area, this rocking motion may require relatively small changes in the total energy of the protein and, therefore, may have minimal impact on the release or binding of iron. Although a previous iron binding analysis of a FutA1-GST fusion protein suggested that FutA1 binds ferric iron, binding analysis presented here clearly demonstrates that the specificity of FutA1 is for the ferrous form instead, with an association constant of about 1 × 1019 m-1. This observation is consistent with the homology of FutA1 to the C. jejuni iron-binding protein that is also specific for ferrous iron. An amino acid sequence alignment between FutA1 and FutA2 indicates that the iron-binding site of FutA2 is also composed of four tyrosines and one histidine. Therefore, it is not surprising that we found that purified FutA2 binds ferrous rather than ferric iron. Consistent with this finding is the fact that the iron binding configuration of these proteins is conserved among bacterial strains that favor low oxygen environments where ferrous iron is more prominent. Cloning of FutA1 (slr1295) and FutA2 (slr0513) from Synechocystis PCC 6803—The solute binding domain of FutA1 (residues 30-360) from Synechocystis PCC 6803 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and ligated into the expression vector pET-28a (Novagen). The pET-28a (Novagen) vector was previously modified such that the thrombin cleavage site was replaced with a tobacco etch virus (TEV) cleavage site. The solute binding domain of FutA2 (residues 31-346) from Synechocystis 6803 was PCR-amplified from genomic DNA and ligated into pET-29a at the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites allowing for native protein expression. E. coli DH5α cells were transformed with the ligation mixtures and then plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Individual colonies were selected and cultured overnight, and plasmid DNA was extracted with the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit (Qiagen Inc.). Positive clones were sequenced by Lark Technologies (Houston, TX). FutA1 and FutA2 Expression—For protein expression, E. coli Rosetta(DE3)pLysS cells (Novagen) were transformed with the pET28a-futA1 plasmid or the pET29a-futA2 plasmid and plated onto LB media supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. After ∼16 h of growth at 37 °C, the colonies were harvested from the plates and used for the inoculation of 2 × 4-liter baffled flasks containing tryptose broth (TB) medium supplemented with 30 μg/ml kanamycin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The cells were grown at 37 °C with shaking (230 rpm) to an A600 of ∼0.4, at which time the temperature was lowered to 22.5 °C for the remainder of the incubation. Thirty minutes after lowering the temperature, protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were allowed to grow for an additional 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation. The cell paste was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. FutA1 Purification—Approximately 10 g of frozen cells were thawed in 50 ml of cold buffer A (25 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, pH 8.0) with one “Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor” tablet (Roche Applied Science). Cells were lysed on ice by four 45-s cycles of sonication separated by 3 min of cooling. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 4 °C for 30 min at 30,000 × g. The clarified lysate was loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Chelating HP cartridge (GE Healthcare) charged with Ni2+ and pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After loading, the column was washed with about 40 ml of 90% buffer A, 10% buffer B (25 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm imidazole at pH 8.0) followed by an elution via a 10-100% linear gradient of buffer B. FutA1-containing fractions were pooled based on SDS-PAGE analysis and dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 200 mm NaCl overnight at 4 °C. For removal of the His tag, recombinant TEV (rTEV) protease was added to dialyzed protein at a molar ratio of ∼1 rTEV:100 FutA1, and the mixture was incubated for 4 h at ∼23 °C, then 16 h at 4 °C. The recombinant TEV (rTEV) protease contained an N-terminal His6 tag that allowed the separation of cleaved FutA1 from both His-tagged FutA1 and rTEV via Ni2+ affinity chromatography, as described above. Native FutA1 was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with 100 mm NaCl. For long-term storage and crystallization, FutA1 was concentrated to ∼47 mg/ml based on an extinction coefficient of ∼1.16 ml/(mg·cm) as calculated by the program Protean (DNAstar, Inc., Madison, WI). Crystallization of Apo and Iron-loaded FutA1—Initial crystallization conditions were obtained using the Crystal Screen by Hampton Research. Before crystallization, a final concentration of 1 mm ammonium ferric sulfate (Sigma-Aldrich) and 1 mm citrate were added to FutA1, which enhanced the deep red-brown color of the purified protein. Ferric iron was used in these early experiments because literature had suggested that FutA1 was a ferric-binding protein (8Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that only high concentrations of freshly prepared iron solutions enhanced the color of the protein. As discussed under “Results,” this is more than likely due to the fact that FutA1 binds ferrous iron and not ferric iron. Colorless apoFutA1 crystals were obtained at room temperature via the hanging drop method of vapor diffusion against 2.2-2.8 m ammonium sulfate, 100 mm succinate, pH 5.0, and 5% isopropanol. These crystals were of the orthorhombic space group P212121 with cell dimensions of a = 59.1 Å, b = 60.7 Å, and c = 91.7 Å. Red-colored crystals of Fut1 complexed with iron were obtained in a similar manner as the apo crystals, with a substitution of 100 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, and the omission of isopropanol. The iron-containing FutA1 crystals were of the monoclinic space group C2 with cell dimensions of a = 98.3 Å, b = 65.7 Å, c = 50.3 Å, and β = 102.4°. High Resolution X-ray Data Collection—X-ray data from apoFutA1 crystals were collected using a using an Oxford cryosystem and a Proteum R Smart 6000 CCD detector connected to a Bruker-Nonius FR591 rotating anode generator. The data were processed with SAINT (Bruker AXS, Inc.) and scaled with SCALA (11Bruker SMART and SAINT. Bruker AXS Inc., Madison, WI1997Google Scholar, 12Collaborative Computational Project no. 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Google Scholar). The iron-loaded protein crystals were flash-frozen for synchrotron data collection. Briefly, crystals were harvested from the hanging drop experiments and soaked for several hours in synthetic mother liquor composed of 100 mm HEPPS, pH 8.0, with 2.7 m ammonium sulfate. Crystals were serially transferred to a final cryoprotectant solution of synthetic mother liquor containing 16% ethylene glycol. The crystals were then flash-cooled by submersion in liquid nitrogen. The iron-loaded FutA1 crystal data were collected on a 3000 × 3000 SBC2 CCD detector at the Structural Biology Center 19-ID beamline (Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL). The x-ray data were processed with HKL2000 and scaled with SCALEPACK (13Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar).

A. 1987; 43: 645-653Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The apoFutA1 model was refined using a combination of manual model-building in O and maximum-likelihood refinement with CNS (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar, 16Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S.

The iron-loaded structure of FutA1 was determined via molecular replacement with the program AMoRe using the refined apoFutA1 as a search model, then refined in a similar manner as the apoprotein structure. All relevant refinement statistics are presented in Table 1. The apoFutA1 structure contained no ions in the metal binding pocket but showed weak electron density for 3 sulfate anions which were modeled with an occupancy of 0.5. The iron-loaded FutA1 contained a single iron atom in the ligand binding pocket, four sulfate anions (one modeled at half-occupancy), and a single molecule of ethylene glycol. FutA2 Purification—FutA2 was purified and refolded from inclusion bodies as previously described (9Waldron K.J. Tottey S. Yanagisawa S. Dennison C. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3837-3846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 g of cells were thawed in 35 ml of inclusion body buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100) with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, DNase I, and lysozyme. Cells were stirred for 1 h at room temperature followed by sonication for 20 s, then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was resuspended in 30 ml of inclusion body buffer with 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol then centrifuged a second time. The pellet was then resuspended in inclusion body buffer with 2 m urea and centrifuged again. The remaining pellet contained nearly pure FutA2 inclusion bodies. This pellet was washed twice with ultrapure water, then resuspended in 30 ml of 6 m urea in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and incubated on ice for 1 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, and the remaining supernatant containing FutA2 was refolded by diluting 17-fold into cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, with 0.1 mm ferrous ammonium sulfate over 48 h. This mixture was then centrifuged to remove insoluble debris, diluted with an equal amount of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP cartridge (GE Healthcare). FutA2 was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl. The red-colored fractions were harvested and dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, and further purified on a 5-ml HiTrap Q HP cartridge. Purified FutA2 had an absorbance peak at ∼434 nm, indicating the presence of bound iron. Iron Removal from FutA1 and FutA2—Purified FutA1 and FutA2 were stripped of iron before binding experiments by dialysis against 50 mm MES, pH 6.0, 10 mm 2,2′-dipyridyl, 100 mm dithionite. Chelating and reducing agents were then removed by dialyzing twice against 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. Iron Analysis—The actual concentration of ferric and ferrous iron in the stock solutions was measured spectrophotometrically at 396 and 515 nm as previously described (17Vogel A.I. Loyenber W.M. Textbook of Quantitative Inorganic Analysis. 3rd Ed. Longman, London1963: 3899-3908Google Scholar). The E396 measurement represents the sum of the ferric and ferrous iron using an empirically determined extinction coefficient of 3.6 × 103 m-1 cm-1. The E515 measurement measured the ferrous concentration alone with an extinction coefficient of 1.12 × 104m-1 cm-1. From these two values, the actual concentrations for the various iron species were calculated. Iron Binding Experiments—Iron binding to FutA1 and FutA2 was performed as has been previously described (8Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 70 μm solution of FutA1 was prepared in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, that contained 200 mm NaCl. A 0.5-ml sample was added to a cuvette, and 8-μl aliquots of 1.0 mm stock solutions of iron were sequentially added. The actual concentration of ferric and ferrous iron in the stock solutions of ammonium ferrous sulfate hexahydrate ((NH4)2Fe(SO4)2·6H2O), ammonium iron (III) sulfate (NH4Fe(SO4)2·12H2O), iron (II) chloride (FeCl2), and iron III chloride (FeCl3) was determined using the spectrophotometric analysis described above immediately before use. After each addition of iron, the absorbance spectrum was measured between 300 and 560 nm using a Beckman Coulter DU 800 spectrophotometer and the associated software analysis package. Similar binding experiments were performed with FutA2 with a 44 μm solution of FutA2. The binding affinity of FutA1 for ferrous iron was performed using the citrate competition experiment as previously described (8Katoh H. Hagino N. Ogawa T. Plant Cell Physiol. 2001; 42: 823-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Crichton R.R. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 281-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). A 70 μm solution of FutA1 was saturated with a solution of ferrous iron and dialyzed overnight to remove the excess iron. The sample was then placed in a cuvette, and a spectrum was collected. Aliquots of sodium citrate were then added, mixed, and allowed to incubate for ∼10 min to allow the protein and citrate to establish an equilibrium. After each incubation, a new spectrum was collected. The optical density at 411 nm was plotted versus the final concentration of citrate, and the resulting curve was fitted to Equation 1 to determine the binding constant of ferrous iron to FutA1 relative to citrate. A=Amax×[citrate]Kd+[citrate] (Eq. 1) where Amax is the initial absorbance of the FutA1/Fe2+ complex at that wavelength, and Kd is the apparent disassociation constant relative to citrate. Analysis of Domain Contacts—The buried surfaces between the two domains of FutA1 were determined by using the programs MSPDB, MS, MSSEP, and MSAV (19Connolly M.L. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1983; 16: 548-558Crossref Google Scholar) and ATMSRF (20Sheriff S. Hendrickson W.A. Stenkamp R.E. Sieker L.C. Jensen L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1104-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and a solvent probe radius of 1.7 Å. The protein was divided into the N-terminal (residues 45-144 and 277-325) and C-terminal (residues 145-276 and 326-360) domains in both the apo and iron-bound structures. The contact areas between these two domains were calculated for both conformations (summarized in Table 2) on an atom-by-atom basis. The differences between these contacts were then mapped onto the surface of the N-terminal domain for display purposes.TABLE 2Domain contact areasResidue typeApoIron-boundMain chainSide chainMain chainSide chainÅ2Å2Acid: Asp, Glu25972170Base: His, Lys, Arg638555165Polar: Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr32493268Small: Ala, Gly20222847Hydrophobic: Cys, Ile, Leu, Met, Pro, Tyr4719058128Aromatic polar: Trp, Tyr4934831272Total surface area1028977 Open table in a new tab The structure of iron-bound FutA1 is highly similar to that of cFbpA from C. jejuni (10Tom-Yew S.A.L. Cui D.T. Bekker E.G. Murphy M.E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9283-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), perhaps more than the homology of the proteins might have suggested (41% identical and 64% similar to each other). Using all of the residues in the two proteins for alignment, the root mean square deviation between Cα backbones is ∼1 Å (Fig. 1). Sequence homology studies on cFbpA from C. jejuni put both FutA1 and FutA2 into the same class of anion-independent iron-binding proteins (10Tom-Yew S.A.L. Cui D.T. Bekker E.G. Murphy M.E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9283-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although residues 30-360 of FutA1 were included in the expression system, only residues 45-360 were clearly defined in the electron density. As is typical of the solute-binding proteins from the ATP binding cassette transporters, FutA1 has two domains with the binding site lying in the cleft between the two domains. One domain is composed mainly of the N-terminal portion of the protein (residues 45-144 and 277-325), and the second domain is composes of the rest of the protein (145-276 and 326-360). Although some metal-binding proteins such as the cluster 9 ATP binding cassette transport systems, have a relatively rigid α-helix running down the back of the protein that restricts domain movement (e.g. Ref. 21Banerjee S. Wei B. Bhattacharyya-Pakrasi M. Pakrasi H.B. Smith T.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 1061-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), FutA1 has two β-strands connecting to two domains of the protein. It is likely that this change accounts for the domain movement between the apo versus iron-bound forms of the protein. Iron Binding Environment in FutA1—From the electron density, it was readily apparent that iron was bound in the colored FutA1 crystals (Fig. 2). 3MolView (34Smith T.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 2004; 37: 654-657Crossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar) was used for the creation of Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 5. As was found in the cFbpA structure (10Tom-Yew S.A.L. Cui D.T. Bekker E.G. Murphy M.E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 9283-9290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), iron is chelated by four tyrosine and one histidine residues. These tyrosine residues are apparently held firmly in place by a strong secondary shell of interacting residues. Arg-145 forms hydrogen bonds with both Tyr-55 and Tyr-241, and Asn-239 also interacts with Tyr-241. These interactions also likely improve iron-tyrosine interactions by increasing the electronegativity of the tyrosine hydroxyls. Unlike the periplasmic iron-binding proteins from Neisseria gonorrhoeae (nFbpA) (22Guo M. Harvey I. Yang W. Coghill L. Campopiano D.J. Parkinson J.A. MacGillivray R.T. Harris W.R. Sadler P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2490-2502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and Haemophilus influenzae (HiFbpA) (23Khan A.G. Shouldice S.R. Tari L.W. Schryvers A.B. Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), there are no apparent anion interactions with the bound iron. The only non-protein atom in the immediate vicinity of the iron is an apparent water molecule that interacts with the Tyr-242 hydroxyl and a sulfate molecule that interacts with that water molecule and the imidazole ring of His-54. In a nearly identical configuration found in the Neisseria FbpA, the iron is bound to FutA1 in a distorted trigonal bipyramidal configuration. Tyrosine residues 55, 185, and 242 form the trigonal plane with angles of 101, 119, and 138°. His-54 and Tyr-241 lie perpendicular to the plane formed by the three tyrosines and form the remaining two coordination sites. Changes in FutA1 Conformation upon Iron Binding and Release—As shown in Fig. 3, when iron binds to FutA1, the two domains pivot about the two β-strands that run along the back of the protein and clamp down upon the bound iron. During refinement of the apo structure, Asp-103 remained an outlier in the Ramachandran plot analysis. The density for this residue is unambiguous, and it is more than likely that this strained backbone configuration is real. Interestingly, this residue is at the flex point of β-strand during domain motion. The iron-binding site is essentially two half-sites that come together as the two domains rotate toward each other. On the N-terminal domain lies His-54 and Tyr-55, and on the C-terminal domain are the remaining three tyrosine residues; Tyr-185, Tyr-241, and Tyr-242. The extensive interactions with the secondary shell of residues in the iron-binding site keep the residues in relatively fixed orientations as the binding cleft opens and closes (Fig. 4). The only residue that rotates into and out of the iron-binding site is His-54. Because iron readily disassociates from FutA1 at pH values less than six (data not shown), it seems likely that His-54 is a major trigger for iron binding and release.FIGURE 4Changes in the iron-"

They exert sedative/hypnotic, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsant effects and act through a specific high affinity binding site on the major inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor, the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. Ligands of the benzodiazepine-binding site are classified into three groups depending on their mode of action: positive and negative allosteric modulators and antagonists. To rationally design ligands of the benzodiazepine site in different isoforms of the GABAA receptor, we need to understand the relative positioning and overlap of modulators of different allosteric properties. To solve these questions, we used a proximity-accelerated irreversible chemical coupling reaction. GABAA receptor residues thought to reside in the benzodiazepine-binding site were individually mutated to cysteine and combined with a cysteine-reactive benzodiazepine site ligand. Direct apposition of reaction partners is expected to lead to a covalent reaction. We describe here such a reaction of predominantly α1H101C and also three other mutants (α1G157C, α1V202C, and α1V211C) with an Imid-NCS derivative in which a reactive isothiocyanate group (–NCS) replaces the azide group (–N3) in the partial negative allosteric modulator Ro15-4513. Our results show four contact points of imidazobenzodiazepines with the receptor, α1H101C being shared by classical benzodiazepines.

The fast neuronal action of the major inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2The abbreviations used are: GABAγ-aminobutyric acidGABAAγ-aminobutyric acid type A. is mediated by GABA type A (GABAA) receptors. They are composed of five subunits and form a chloride-selective ion channel (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). A variety of subunit isoforms have been cloned, leading to a multiplicity of receptor subtypes (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

The major receptor isoform in mammalian brain consists of α1, β2, and γ2 subunits (1Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev.

Benzodiazepines, which act at GABAA receptors, are among the most widely used drugs. Ligands of the benzodiazepine-binding site have been classified into positive and negative allosteric modulators and antagonists. To synthesize ligands of the benzodiazepine-binding site specific for different GABAA receptor isoforms, it is desirable to understand the relative positioning and overlap of different allosteric modulators. Pharmacophore/receptor models for positive allosteric modulators and antagonists have been developed to identify the molecular properties and mode of ligand/receptor interaction (e.g. Refs. 11Huang Q. Liu R. Zhang P. McKernan R. Gan T. Bennet D.W. Cook J.M. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 4130-4142Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar and 12Huang Q. He X. Ma C. Liu R. Yu S. Dayer C. Wenger G.R. McKernan R. Cook J.M. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 43: 71-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). This work has suggested common contact points of ligands differing in their allosteric effect, but there is only speculation on corresponding amino acid residues (13He X. Zhang C. Cook J.M. Med. Chem. Res. 2001; 10: 269-308Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling has been used to identify His101 of the α1 subunit as the target of [3H]flunitrazepam (14Duncalfe L.L. Carpenter M.R. Smillie L.B. Martin I.L. Dunn S.M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9209-9214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and Tyr209 as the target of [3H]Ro15-4513 (15Sawyer G.W. Chiara D.C. Olsen R.W. Cohen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 50036-50045Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, these results should take into account possible formation of long-lived reactive intermediates after photoactivation (16Brunner J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 483-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 17Rizk M.S. Shi X. Platz M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An alternative approach studied consequences of single point mutation in GABAA receptors using radioactive ligand binding assay and/or electrophysiological measurements; by this, a large number of amino acid residues were identified on both α and γ subunits to build up the benzodiazepine-binding site (18Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 19Sigel E. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2002; 2: 833-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Our approach is based ultimately on the work of Karlin and Akabas (20Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), who used site-specific mutations to cysteine in combination with a water-soluble nonspecific cysteine-reactive reagent. Covalent reaction was taken as evidence for water accessibility of the corresponding residue. This method has been extended to site-specific investigations by replacing high concentrations of the nonspecific agents with low concentrations of ligands of a defined binding site, carrying a reactive substituent. Direct apposition of such reaction partners is expected to lead to a covalent reaction (21Foucaud B. Perret P. Grutter T. Goeldner M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2001; 22: 170-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In the benzodiazepine-binding site, a covalent interaction of α1H101C with a reactive group attached to the –C atom in diazepam normally carrying a –Cl atom was found (22Berezhnoy D. Nyfeler Y. Gonthier A. Schwob H. Goeldner M. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We show here covalent interaction of the same residue, plus three additional residues, with the reactive group attached to the position normally occupied by–N3 in the partial negative allosteric modulator Ro15-4513. Our results identify four contact points of this ligand with the receptor. On the basis of this result and earlier observations (22Berezhnoy D. Nyfeler Y. Gonthier A. Schwob H. Goeldner M. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3160-3168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 41Sigel E. Schaerer M.T. Buhr A. Baur R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1097-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) we suggest a similar orientation of classical benzodiazepines and imidazobenzodiazepines bound to the receptor. Synthesis—We used a substance in the imidazobenzodiazepine series we call the Imid-NCS compound, which is similar to Ro15-4513 except that the–N3 group is replaced with–NCS (see Fig. 1). The Imid-NCS derivative was synthesized from the amine precursor, which was a gift from Hoffmann-La Roche. This precursor (200 mg, 0.67 mmol) and ammonium hydrogenocarbonate (224 mg, 1.34 mmol, 2 eq) were diluted in a mixture of chloroform (34 ml) and water (13 ml). After 20 min of vigorous stirring, thiophosgene (61 μl, 0.80 mmol, 1.2 eq) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was stirred for 1.5 h at room temperature. 20 ml of a 5% NaHCO3 aqueous solution were then added to neutralize excess thiophosgene. The mixture was extracted with dichloromethane. After filtration and drying on Na2SO4, the organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure. The crude Imid-NCS product was rapidly purified on a neutral alumina column eluted with a mixture of heptane/ethyl acetate (2:1), leading to quantitative formation of the Imid-NCS compound. 1H NMR (CDCl3 - 200 MHz), δ (ppm) 7.97 (m, 2H, H7 + H9), 747 (m, 2H, H10 + H1), 5.21 (m, 1H, H4(1)), 7.44 (m, 3H, H4(2) + CH2), 3.25 (3H, N-CH3), and 1.45 (t, 3H, CH3, J = 7.1 Hz); 13C NMR (CDCl3 - 75 MHz), δ (ppm) 165.7 (C=O(6)), 163.2 (EtO-C=O), 140.0 (C11), 135.8 (–NCS), 135.6 (C1), 133 (C3), 131.2 (C13), 130.7 (C8), 130.5 (C9), 130.0 (C7), 129.3 (C12), 124.1 (C10), 61.9 (O-CH2(1′)), 42.9 (CH2(4)), 36.6 (N-CH3), and 15.0 (CH3(2′)); IR (CsI), ν (cm-1) 2113 (–NCS) and 1645 (C=O). This Imid-NCS compound was dissolved in Me2SO at a concentration of 10 mm and kept at -80 °C at most for 1 month. Final dilutions in assay medium were prepared immediately before each experiment. Construction of Receptor Subunits—The cDNAs coding for the α1, β2, and γ2S subunits of the rat GABAA receptor channel have been described (23Lolait S.J. O'Carroll A.M. Kusano K. Muller J.M. Brownstein M.J. Mahan L.C. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 145-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Malherbe P. Draguhn A. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Möhler H. Mol. Brain Res. 1990; 8: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All mutant subunits were prepared using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNAs were subcloned into the polylinker of pBC/CMV (25Bertocci B. Miggiano V. Da Prada M. Dembic Z. Lahm H.W. Malherbe P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) for cell transfection. This expression vector allows high level expression of a foreign gene under the control of the cyto-megalovirus promoter. The α subunit was cloned into the EcoRI site and the β and γ subunits into the SmaI site of the polylinker using standard techniques. Transfection of Recombinant GABAA Receptors in Human Embryonic Kidney 293 Cells—Human Embryonic kidney 293 cells (CRL1573, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in minimal essential medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μl/ml streptomycin. The cells were plated on 90-mm dishes and transfected with a total amount of 20 μg of DNA (plasmid ratio of 1:1:1)/dish by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (26Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar). After overnight incubation (3% CO2), the transfected cells were washed twice with serum-free medium and refed with supplemented medium. Membrane Preparation—Approximately 60 h after transfection, the cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (130 mm NaCl, 20 mm Na2HPO4, and 4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and centrifuged at 560 × g. Two more washing steps were performed with phosphate buffer (10 mm KH2PO4, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm K-EDTA, pH 7.4). Cells were sonicated in the presence of 700 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm EDTA. The membranes collected by three centrifugation resuspension cycles (100,000 × g for 20 min) were then used for ligand binding or were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Radioactive Ligand Binding Assay—The properties of the recombinant mutant receptors were only estimated because a complete characterization of all membranes expressing mutant receptors would have exceeded our working capacity. For this affinity estimate, membranes were resuspended in phosphate buffer using a Teflon homogenizer. They were incubated in a total volume of 360 μl for 1 h on ice in the presence of [3H]Ro15-1788 (78.6 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or [3H]flunitrazepam (71–84 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The final protein concentration was 0.1–1 mg of protein/ml. Total binding was measured at 2 and 20 nm [3H]Ro15-1788 or [3H]flunitrazepam. Nonspecific binding was determined under the same condition but in the presence of 100 μm unlabeled Ro15-1788 or flunitrazepam, respectively. Membranes were collected by rapid filtration on GF/C filters presoaked in 0.3% polyethyleneimine. After three washing steps with 5 ml of phosphate buffer, the filter-retained radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. To perform displacement binding assays, various concentrations of competing ligands (Imid-NCS compound) were added. The concentration of [3H]Ro15-1788 used was ∼3 times the Kd value. On the basis of IC50 determinations, the Ki value was determined according to the Cheng-Prusoff equation (27Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12292) Google Scholar). In all experiments, each single sample was measured in triplicate. Detection of a Covalent Reaction—Detection of a covalent reaction included (a) incubation of membranes expressing wild-type or mutant receptors with the Imid-NCS compound, (b) extensive washing of the membranes to remove non-reacted Imid-NCS compound, and (c) radioactive ligand binding assay to determine residual binding. No covalent reaction would result in 100% residual binding/0% reaction, and 100% covalent reaction would result in 0% residual binding/100% reaction. 200 μl of diluted membranes (∼0.01–0.1 mg of protein/ml) were incubated with the Imid-NCS compound for 1 h on ice. The maximal final solvent concentration during this incubation was 1%. Subsequently, 1.8 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and 2 ml of ice-cold phosphate buffer were added to the pellets before centrifugation. The whole procedure was repeated twice. After the third centrifugation, the supernatant was removed, leaving ∼200 μl in the tube. The pellet was resuspended using a Teflon pestle, and 120 μl of ice-cold phosphate buffer were added. During this procedure, 30–50% of the protein was lost. After homogenization, a binding assay was performed in a total volume of 360 μl. Controls containing no reactive substance allowed normalization in each experiment. As the efficiency of membrane recovery during the whole procedure was found to be quite variable and differed between two experiments up to 30%, we assumed covalent reaction when residual binding was <70% of the controls. Where indicated, the Imid-NCS compound was pre-reacted by preincubation for 1 h at room temperature with 100 mm l-cysteine. To protect the binding site from covalent reaction, membranes were incubated with unlabeled Ro15-1788 or flunitrazepam for 10 min on ice. Subsequently, the Imid-NCS compound was added, and 3 min later, the first centrifugation was started. cRNA Synthesis—Capped cRNAs were synthesized (Ambion, Austin, TX) from the linearized pCMV vectors containing the different subunits. A poly(A) tail of ∼400 residues was added to each transcript using yeast poly(A) polymerase (United States Biological Inc., Cleveland, OH). The concentration of the cRNA was quantified on a formaldehyde gel using Radiant Red stain (Bio-Rad) for visualization of the RNA. Known concentrations of an RNA ladder (Invitrogen) were loaded as standards on the same gel. cRNA combinations were precipitated in ethanol/isoamyl alcohol (19:1) and stored at -20 °C. Expression and Functional Characterization in Xenopus Oocytes—Xenopus laevis oocytes were prepared, injected, and defollicated as described previously (28Sigel E. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 386: 73-90Crossref Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 29Sigel E. Minier F. Mol. Nutr. Food Res. 2005; 49: 228-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). They were injected with 50 nl of cRNA solution containing wild-type or mutant α1, β2, and γ2 subunits at a concentration of 10:10:50 nm (30Boileau A.J. Baur R. Sharkey L.M. Sigel E. Czajkowski C. Neuropharmacology. 2002; 43: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and then incubated in modified Barth's solution (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 88 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.34 mm Ca(NO3)2, 0.41 mm CaCl2, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) at +18 °C for at least 24 h before the measurements. Electrophysiological experiments were performed using the two-electrode voltage clamp method at a holding potential of -80 mV. The perfusion medium contained 90 mm NaCl, 1 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.4. Allosteric modulation via the benzodiazepine site and covalent reaction were measured at a GABA concentration eliciting 2–5% of the maximal GABA current amplitude. GABA was applied for 20 s alone or in combination with the modulatory compound. Modulation of GABA currents was expressed as a percentage of the respective control current amplitudes determined in the absence of modulator. The perfusion system was cleaned between drug applications by washing with Me2SO to avoid contamination. Modification of Receptor Function by the Imid-NCS Compound or Iodoacetamide—Wild-type α1β2γ2 and mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2, α1G157Cβ2γ2, α1V202Cβ2γ2, and α1V211Cβ2γ2 receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. After obtaining a reproducible response to the application of GABA, the Imid-NCS compound freshly diluted to 1 μm in perfusion medium was applied for 1 min (in the case of mutant receptors). Wild-type receptors were exposed for 1 or 5 min to 1 μm Imid-NCS compound or for 5 min to 10 μm Imid-NCS compound. In some cases, 10 μm Ro15-1788 was applied for a period of 30 s before, during, and for a period of 60 s after exposure to the Imid-NCS compound to protect the binding site from a covalent reaction. The maximal final solvent concentration was 0.1%. This concentration of Me2SO did not affect the response to GABA in control experiments. This treatment was followed by several GABA applications at intervals of 4 min to reach a steady level. Subsequently, 10 or 1 μm zolpidem or 1 μm Ro15-1788 was co-applied with GABA to investigate a covalent reaction with the Imid-NCS compound. The irreversible effect was then calculated as follows: stimulation ((Iafter Imid-NCS/Ibefore Imid-NCS) - 1) × 100%. Where indicated, the Imid-NCS compound was inactivated by preincubation of 500 nm Imid-NCS compound in medium containing 10 mm l-cysteine for 1 h. Control experiments showed that 10 mm l-cysteine did not significantly alter the response to GABA. The effect of the nonspecific cysteine-modifying reagent iodoacetamide was tested on wild-type α1β2γ2 and mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors. 2 mm iodoacetamide freshly diluted in perfusion medium was perfused for 5 min after obtaining a stable GABA response. Subsequently, GABA was applied to test whether iodoacetamide irreversibly affects GABA-elicited currents. This was followed by co-application of GABA with 1 μm zolpidem in the case of wild-type α1β2γ2 and mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors. Alternatively, mutant receptors were treated for 1 min with 1 μm Imid-NCS compound. Binding Properties of the Cysteine-reactive Compound—The–N3 group in Ro15-4513 was replaced with an–NCS group (Fig. 1) such as to become reactive with a cysteine residue. This substance, the Imid-NCS compound, was able to displace [3H]Ro15-1788 from wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors in a concentration-dependent manner. The Ki value was 10 ± 1 nm (mean ± S.D., n = 3, each point of the three displacement curves was measured in triplicate) (data not shown). Thus, the reactive molecule retained affinity for the benzodiazepine-binding site. Binding Properties of GABAA Receptors Carrying a Cysteine Point Mutation—Several amino acid residues putatively located in or near the benzodiazepine-binding pocket were individually mutated to cysteine. We focused our interest on some amino acid residues in loops A–C of the α1 subunit and loop D of the γ2 subunit. We investigated a total of 23 positions. In loops A–C of the α1 subunit, we studied His101, Gly157–Thr162, and Ile201–Met212, respectively; and in loop D of the γ2 subunit, we studied Thr73, Asp75, Ala79, and Thr81. In three of the receptors (α1G207Cβ2γ2, α1S158Cβ2γ2, and α1Y159Cβ2γ2), the mutation to cysteine drastically decreased [3H]Ro15-1788 and [3H]flunitrazepam binding affinity so that no specific binding was detected (data not shown). Fortunately, in the 20 other receptors, the mutation to cysteine did not compromise [3H]Ro15-1788 binding. All mutant receptors bound [3H]Ro15-1788 with an estimated affinity between 0.5 and 4.6 nm (data not shown). Irreversible Reaction of the Imid-NCS Compound with Mutant Receptors—The receptors were exposed to the Imid-NCS compound, and noncovalently bound reactive ligand was subsequently removed by extensive washing (see “Experimental Procedures”). In such experiments, the Imid-NCS compound is expected to first occupy its binding site reversibly. In the case of proper apposition of the–SH group of the cysteine of the mutant receptor with the–C atom of the–NCS group of the Imid-NCS compound, this is followed by the formation of a covalent bond between ligand and receptor. Fig. 2 documents the residual binding of wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors and all 20 mutant receptors after treatment with 100 nm Imid-NCS compound. 30–50% of the protein was lost during the washing steps. Therefore, each experiment included a control without reactive ligand. Residual binding in this sample was standardized to 100%, and residual binding in the other samples was expressed relative to this value. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” only receptors showing a level of residual binding lower than 70% were assumed to have reacted covalently. In receptors carrying the mutation H101C in the α1 subunit, the Imid-NCS compound led to the disappearance of ∼85% of the binding sites. α1G157Cβ2γ2, α1V202Cβ2γ2, and α1V211Cβ2γ2 receptors also reacted irreversibly with the Imid-NCS compound. In these cases, 50–74% of the binding sites disappeared. Fig. 3 (left) shows that this reaction was strongly inhibited (p < 0.001) when 30 nm Imid-NCS compound was previously reacted with 100 mm l-cysteine. Residual binding was 82 ± 9% (n = 3) with l-cysteine treatment compared with 18 ± 9% (n = 3) without treatment. In additional experiments, covalent reaction of α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors with 10 nm Imid-NCS compound was inhibited by carrying out the reaction in the presence of 1 μm Ro15-1788 or 30 μm flunitrazepam (Fig. 3, right). Residual binding was increased from 29 ± 3% (n = 3) in the absence of both agents to 73 ± 4% (n = 3; p < 0.001) and 64 ± 6% (n = 3; p < 0.001) in the presence of Ro15-1788 and flunitrazepam, respectively. Unfortunately, the method used did not allow us to carry out similar protection experiments in α1G157Cβ2γ2, α1V202Cβ2γ2, and α1V211Cβ2γ2 receptors, as much higher concentrations of the Imid-NCS compound were required in these cases to observe covalent reaction. This would have necessitated the use of very high concentrations of Ro15-1788 or flunitrazepam, which could not have been removed efficiently to allow reversible binding experiments. Concentration Dependence of the Covalent Reaction of the Imid-NCS Compound with Wild-type α1β2γ2 and Mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2 Receptors—Fig. 4 shows the percentage of covalently reacted binding sites as a function of the concentration of the Imid-NCS compound. The apparent Kd value for mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors was 0.9 ± 0.4 nm (mean ± S.D., n = three curves, triplicates of each point). Surprisingly, wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors also reacted covalently with the compound, but with a much higher apparent Kd value of 878 ± 306 nm (mean ± S.D., n = three curves, triplicates of each point). Please note that these values due to an irreversible component do not correspond to the true Kd value of the Imid-NCS compound for the respective receptors. We hypothesized that the covalent reaction occurring with wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors could be due to an endogenous reactive amino acid residue. As there are no free cysteines in the extracellular domains of the α1 and γ2 subunits, we concentrated on Tyr and His located in the binding pocket as possible candidates and investigated mutant receptors in which the respective Tyr and His were replaced with other residues. α1Y159Fβ2γ2, α1Y161Fβ2γ2, and α1Y209Fβ2γ2 receptors bound [3H]Ro15-1788 with an estimated affinity between 0.8 and 3.6 nm, and α1H101Rβ2γ2 receptors retained an affinity for Ro15-4513 of ∼13 nm (data not shown). α1H101Rβ2γ2, α1Y159Fβ2γ2, and α1Y161Fβ2γ2 receptors showed comparable levels of covalent reaction with the Imid-NCS compound compared with wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors, whereas α1Y209Fβ2γ2 receptors reacted to a somewhat smaller extent (1 and 10 μm Imid-NCS compound for 1 h on ice) (data not shown). As all mutant receptors were still reacting covalently, the above residues can be excluded as targets of the covalent reaction in wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors. It should be pointed out here that, in the case of α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors, a complete reaction was never reached, but only ∼85% of the receptors were observed to react covalently. After reaction of the mutant receptor with the reactive agent, the covalent adduct is slowly hydrolyzed to produce the receptor as it was prior to the reaction (31Hinman A. Chuang H. Bautista D.M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19564-19568Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar, 32Macpherson L.J. Dubin A.E. Evans M.J. Marr F. Schultz P.G. Cravatt B.F. Patapoutian A.

The Mutation H101C in the α1 Subunit Influences Allosteric Effects of Benzodiazepine Ligands—To investigate how the mutation to cysteine influences the functional properties, wild-type α1β2γ2 and mutant α1H101Cβ2γ2 receptors were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. It has been shown previously that amino acid substitutions at position 101 of the α1 subunit can change the allosteric properties of ligands of the benzodiazepine-binding site (33Davies M. Bateson A.N. Dunn S.M.J. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2188-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34Dunn S.M.J. Davies M. Muntoni A.L. Lambert J.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 768-774PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we made similar observations with the substitution of α1His101 with cysteine (Fig. 5). As shown in Table 1, the antagonist Ro15-1788 had a small stimulatory effect; the partial negative allosteric modulator Ro15-4513 showed also a weak stimulating behavior. Zolpidem, which is a positive allosteric modulator, also stimulated the GABA responses, but with a 6-fold lower affinity and a 2.6-fold lower efficacy. The Imid-NCS compound potentiated the GABA-elicited current with an apparent affinity of 17 ± 1 nm and a maximal stimulation of 90 ± 7% (n = 3). Please note that the cumulative dose-response curve for the Imid-NCS compound is a mixture of noncovalent and covalent reactions. In wild-type α1β2γ2 receptors, the Imid-NCS compound showed very little stimulation, amounting maximally to 11 ± 9% (n = 5) (Fig. 5).TABLE 1Concentration-dependent modulation of the GABA EC2-5 current of wild-type and mutant GABAA receptors by zolpidem, Ro15-1788, Ro15-4513, and the Imid-NCS compound The modulatory compound was applied several times for 20 s each.

This molecule has a structure similar to TAB2 and functions as a supportive protein of TAB2. Various alternations of intracellular functions by infecting HTLV-1 and Tax expression result in the onset of ATLL; however, the molecular mechanisms of these alternations are still unclear. The present study investigated whether TAK1 is involved in Tax-dependent NF-κB activation and other signaling pathways in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Antibodies and Reagents—Antibodies against TAK1 (M-579), TAB1 (C-20), TAB2 (K-20), p65 (C-20-G), IKKα (H-744), IKKγ (FL-419), IκBα (C-21), HA tag (Y-11-G), and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA; PC-10) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

Immunoblotting—Cell lysates, prepared as described previously (6Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol.

The membrane was treated with BlockAce (Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Suita, Japan) overnight at 4 °C and probed with primary antibodies as described above. Antibodies were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit, anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-sheep IgG (Dako), and visualized with the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cell lysates were diluted with an equal volume of dilution buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.7, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). After centrifugation, lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA tag antibody (as negative control) or anti-TAB2 antibody or anti-TAB3 antibody on ice for 1.5 h and then rotated with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) at 4 °C for 1.5 h. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with wash buffer (1:1 mixture of whole cell lysate buffer and dilution buffer). RNA Interference—Cells were electroporated with each siRNA for TAK1, TAB2, Tax, JNK1/2, p38α, and firefly luciferase (Luc) using the Amaxa electroporation system. Duplex siRNAs with a two-nucleotide overhang at the 3′-end of the sequence were designed at iGENE Therapeutics and synthesized by Hokkaido System Science Co. The target sequences were as follows: TAK1, UGGCUUAUCUUACACUGGA (TAK1–1) and GAGAUCGACUACAAGGAGA (TAK1–2); negative control of TAK1–1, UGGCUUAUCUCACCCUGGA (TAK1-m); TAB2, CAGAAUGGAACGACUUCAAAGAGAA; Tax, ACAAGCGAAUAGAAGAACUCCUCUA; p38α, GCAUUACAACCAGACAGUUGAUAUU; JNK1 (MAPK8), GCAGUUAGAUGAAAGGGAACACACA; JNK2 (MAPK9), CCAGUUGGAAGAAAGAGAACAUGCA; and firefly luciferase (GL2), CGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA. Real-time RT-PCR—Total RNAs were prepared using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). First-strand cDNAs were synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were amplified quantitatively using SYBR Green PCR mix (TaKaRa). The primer sequences were as follows: TAB2, forward (5′-GCATTCTGGCTGGGTAT-3′) and reverse (5′-GCTGATTTGGCTGTTGA-3′); TAB3, forward (5′-TGTACTCCATCACCATCTCCT-3′) and reverse (5′-TGCTTTGCTAACCTCTCCAT-3′); and GAPDH, forward (5′-GGTGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTT-3′) and reverse (5′-GATGCCAAAGTTGTCATGGATG ACC-3′). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using a Prism 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). All data were normalized to GAPDH mRNA. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from HuT-102 cells as described previously (21Sakurai H. Kurus R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and probed with 32P-labeled consensus κB and Oct-1 sites. The protein-DNA complexes were separated on 4% PAGE as described previously (21Sakurai H. Kurus R. Sano K. Tsuchiya T. Tsuda M. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 2067-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cell Viability Assay—HuT-102 cells cultured for 54 h with 5Z-7-oxozeaenol or IKK inhibitor VI. Cell viability was measured using a Cell Titer-Glo kit (Promega). Tax-induced Activation of NF-κB and CREB/ATF—We first investigated the relationship between the activation of intracellular signals and Tax expression in HTLV-1 infected cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, Tax expression correlated with activation of the IKK-NF-κB pathway. Constitutive IKK kinase activity correlated with the phosphorylation of p65 at Ser-536 and IκBα at Ser-32/Ser-36 (Fig. 1A). In addition, JNK, p38, CREB, ATF1, and ATF2 were also activated in Tax-expressing T cells (Fig. 1B). Tax-dependent TAK1 Activation and TAB2 Expression—Although Tax interacts with IKKγ (2Jin D.Y. Giordano V. Kibler K.V. Nakano H. Jeang K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17402-17405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), it remains unknown how it activates the IKK complex. Here, we hypothesized that Tax recruits the upstream molecule to activate IKK. TAK1 is a potential candidate for this molecule as it has been shown to be an IKK kinase in several cells including splenic T lymphocytes. We therefore investigated whether Tax could activate TAK1 in HTLV-1-transformed cells. As shown in Fig. 2A, the phosphorylation of TAK1 at Thr-187, a critical site for TAK1 activation, was promoted selectively in Tax-positive cells (Hut-102 and MT-2). Interestingly, in these cells, the expression of TAB2, but not TAB3, increased at the both protein and mRNA levels (Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, the shifted band of TAB1 on SDS-PAGE was detected in Tax-positive cells, although the protein expression levels were comparable. Immunoprecipitation with anti-TAB2 or TAB3 antibodies revealed increased formation of the active TAK1 complex with TAB1 and TAB2 but not TAB3. Furthermore, knockdown of Tax by siRNA decreased TAB2 expression as well as TAK1 activation in HuT-102 cells (Fig. 2C). In addition, down-regulation of TAB2 led to decreased phosphorylation of TAK1 without affecting Tax protein expression. These results indicate that Tax activates TAK1 by increasing TAB2 expression at the endogenous level. TAK1 Activation Is Important for the Activation of MAPKs but Not of NF-κB—To examine whether activated TAK1 causes NF-κB activation, we evaluated the effect of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, a specific inhibitor for TAK1, on the downstream signaling pathways. Although treatment with the inhibitor resulted in a rapid decrease in the phosphorylation of TAK1 at 3–12 h (Fig. 3A), the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 was not affected in HuT-102 and MT-2 cells (Fig. 3B). On the other hand, TAK1 inhibitor suppressed the activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 3B). In contrast, a specific IKKβ inhibitor blocked selectively the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 (Fig. 3B). This correlated with the fact that TAK1 complex did not physiologically associate with Tax-IKK complex (Fig. 3C). Similarly, RNA interference (RNAi) of TAK1 suppressed the activation of JNK and p38 but not NF-κB (Fig. 3D). The constitutive IKK kinase activity and the DNA binding activity of NF-κB were not affected by inactivation of TAK1 by RNAi (Fig. 3, D and E). Moreover, although IKK inhibitor induced a severe apoptotic response, a higher concentration of TAK1 inhibitor did not induce cell death (Fig. 3F). These results clearly demonstrated that Tax-dependent TAK1 activation is independent of NF-κB activation but is important for the activation of stress-activated MAPKs. Activation of ATF2 by TAK1 through JNK1—To characterize the physiological role of activated TAK1 in HTLV-1-transformed cells, we next investigated the effects of TAK1 kinase activity blockade on the CREB/ATF family of transcription factors. Both 5Z-7-oxozeaenol and TAK1 siRNA suppressed the constitutive phosphorylation of ATF2, but not of CREB and ATF1 (Fig. 4, A and B). A JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, also inhibited the signal leading to ATF2. We further clarify the role of JNK1 and JNK2 by RNAi and found that JNK1 transduced mainly the TAK1 signal to ATF2 activation (Fig. 4D). These results indicate that TAK1 regulates the activation of ATF2 via JNK1 activation. TAK1 Is Negatively Regulated by p38-mediated TAB1 Phosphorylation—On the other hand, a p38 inhibitor, SB203580, and siRNA against p38α enhanced the JNK-ATF signal (Fig. 4, C and E). It has been reported that the association of TAB1 with p38α negatively regulates TAK1 kinase activity by phosphorylating TAB1. We therefore hypothesized that the inhibition of p38 promoted the activation of TAK1 by canceling TAB1-dependent feedback inhibition. As expected, p38 inhibitor increased TAK1 activation with decreased TAB1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4F). These results suggest that p38 maintains the level of TAK1 activity by controlling the TAB1-mediated negative feedback mechanism. Constitutive activation of NF-κB is a typical pathological alteration in several cancer cells including ATLL cells. We reported previously that IKK phosphorylates p65 at Ser-536 (22Sakurai H. Chiba H. Miyoshi H. Sugita T. Toriumi W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30353-30356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). In the present study, enhanced phosphorylation of p65 was observed in Tax-positive cells, suggesting that p65 phosphorylation will be a useful marker for detecting the constitutive activation of NF-κB in cancer cells. We also found that TAK1 is constitutively activated through Tax-mediated overexpression of TAB2 (Fig. 2A). TAK1 has been shown to play a critical role in NF-κB activation in response to various extracellular stimuli including T cell receptor activation (5Ninomiya Tsuji J. Kishimoto K. Hiyama A. Inoue J.

Therefore, we hypothesized that Tax-dependent activation of TAK1 might induce IKK activation; however, our data did not support this hypothesis (Fig. 2C). Wu and Sun (24Wu X. Sun S.C. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 510-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) recently reported that TAK1 is involved in Tax-induced activation of NF-κB; however, no direct evidence of the role of TAK1 in Tax induction of NF-κB in HTLV-1-transformed cells was shown. In contrast, this led to the conclusion of direct blockade of TAK1 kinase activity using both chemical inhibitor and siRNA in HTLV-1-transformed cells. They also showed that TAK1 associates with Tax-IKK complex in SLB-1 cells (Tax-positive HTLV-1-transformed cells). We also observed constitutive activation of TAK1 in the cell line (data not shown); however, the association of TAK1 with the Tax-IKK complex could not be detected in HuT-102 cells (Fig. 3C). Consistent with our data, Ghoda et al. (25Gohda J. Irisawa M. Tanaka Y. Sato S. Ohtani K. Fujisawa J. Inoue J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 225-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that Tax is not able to induce IKK phosphorylation in TAK1–/– MEFs. Further study will be necessary to settle this issue; however, we currently believe that Tax-dependent IKK activation is regulated by a factor other than TAK1. Recently, protein phosphatase 2A has been reported as a candidate for this factor (26Hong S. Wang L.C. Gao X. Kuo Y.L. Liu B. Merling R. Kung H.J. Shih H.M. Giam C.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12119-12126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The JNK pathway has been widely accepted as another main signal triggered by activated TAK1. It should be noted that TAK1 is essential for activation of the JNK-ATF2 pathway in HTLV-1-infected cells. RNAi experiment also revealed that JNK1, but not JNK2, is essential for activation of ATF2. In addition, persistent activation of p38α negatively regulated the TAK1-JNK1-ATF2 pathway by phosphorylating TAB1. Moreover, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is known as a target for TAK1 (27Ishitani T. Kishida S. Hyodo Miura J. Ueno N. Yasuda J. Waterman M. Shibuya H. Moon R.T. Ninomiya Tsuji J. Matsumoto K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 28Ishitani T. Ninomiya Tsuji J. Nagai S. Nishita M. Meneghini M. Barker N. Waterman M. Bowerman B. Clevers H. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. Nature. 1999; 399: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar); however, TAK1 inhibitor had no inhibitory effect on the stable expression of β-catenin in HTLV-1-infected cells (data not shown). Collectively, we claim that the constitutive activation of TAK1 led to the activation of stress-activated MAPKs but not NF-κB. It has been reported that the expressions of various genes, including cIAP2, CCR6, CCR4, CXCR4, and STAT5, are up-regulated in Tax-positive ATLL cells compared with Tax-negative T cells. We therefore assessed the effects of TAK1 knockdown on the expression of these genes; however, no inhibitory effect was observed (data not shown). In contrast, knockdown of NF-κB p65 resulted in the down-regulation of cIAP2 gene expression (data not shown). This was correlated with the fact that IKK inhibitor, but not TAK1 inhibitor, induced cell death (Fig. 3E). Microarray analysis will help our understanding of the physiological function of activated TAK1 in HTLV-1-transformed cells. Another important finding in the present study is that TAB2, but not TAB3, is overexpressed in a Tax-dependent fashion. TAB2 has been characterized as an adaptor protein that regulates the activation of TAK1. Interestingly, it has recently been reported that TAB2 localizes in the nucleus and is able to associate with a transcriptional co-repressor NcoR, an epidermal growth factor receptor family (ErbB4), and nuclear receptors such as androgen receptor (29Schlessinger J. Lemmon M.A. Cell. 2006; 127: 45-48Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Zhu P. Baek S.H. Bourk E.M. Ohgi K.A. Garcia Bassets I. Sanjo H. Akira S. Kotol P.F. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Rose D.W. Cell. 2006; 124: 615-629Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that TAB2 has several potential physiological functions apart from TAK1 activation. Therefore, further study from the viewpoint of TAB2 overexpression, including analysis of the transcriptional mechanism of TAB2 expression and a search for its associate proteins in HTLV-1-infected cells, will shed light on the pathophysiological importance of our findings. In addition, it is interesting to speculate whether TAB2 is overexpressed in other cancer cells. In summary, we have provided a new insight into the pathophysiological function of TAK1 in HTLV-1-infected T cells. TAK1 has also been shown to be an oncoprotein component of the Epstein-Barr virus latent membrane protein 1 complex (31Uemura N. Kajino T. Sanjo H. Sato S. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Ninomiya Tsuji J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 7863-7872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 32Wan J. Sun L. Mendoza J.W. Chui Y.L. Huang D.P. Chen Z.J. Suzuki N. Suzuki S. Yeh W.C. Akira S. Matsumoto K. Liu Z.G. Wu Z. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 192-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). These findings altogether raise the possibility that TAK1 is a key molecule in virus-related oncogenesis; however, virus infection and oncoproteins dramatically change the intracellular environment. Further basic and clinical investigations will be essential in exploring this possibility. We are grateful to Drs. M. Nishihara, M. Maeda, and P. Cohen for generous gifts of 5Z-7-oxozeaenol, MT-1 cells, and phospho-TAB1 antibody, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2053499532,"Multiple myeloma is currently an incurable cancer of plasma B cells often characterized by overproduction of abnormally high quantities of a patient-specific, clonotypic immunoglobulin “M-protein.” The M-protein is expressed on the cell membrane and secreted into the blood. We previously showed that ligand-toxin conjugates (LTC) incorporating the ribosome-inactivating Ricin-A toxin were very effective in specific cytolysis of the anti-ligand antibody-bearing target cells used as models for multiple myeloma. Here, we report on the incorporation of the membrane-disruptive Cyt1Aa toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis into LTCs targeted to murine myeloma cells.

The recombinant fusion-encoding genes were cloned and expressed in acrystalliferous B. thuringiensis subsp. israelensis through the shuttle vector pHT315. Both chemically conjugated and genetically fused LTCs were toxic to anti-myelin basic protein-expressing murine hybridoma cells, but the recombinant conjugates were more active.

Chemotherapy has for many years been an important component of the cancer therapeutic arsenal, but lack of target cell specificity of most anticancer drugs leads to concentration-dependent toxicity of normal cells. The resultant use of suboptimal therapeutic doses precludes the elimination of all the cancer cells, a situation that encourages clinical recurrence of the tumor (1Rihova B. Crit. Rev. Biotechnol. 1997; 17: 149-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) as well as emergence of resistant clones (2Yang H.H. Ma M.H. Vescio R.A. Berenson J.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 4239-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This scenario has stimulated development of a variety of targeted drug delivery systems, the advantages of which include, aside from target cell specificity, reduced drug dosage and increased cytotoxic efficacy (reviewed in Refs. 3Allen T.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 750-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (1370) Google Scholar, 4Shukla G.S. Krag D.N. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2006; 6: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). As components of the targeting system, delivery moieties with a wide range of biological functions have been employed, such as monoclonal antibodies, receptor binding peptides, liposomes, and nucleotide aptamers (4Shukla G.S. Krag D.N. Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2006; 6: 39-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 5MacDonald G.C. Glover N. Curr. Opin. Drug Discov.

Most of the cytotoxic components currently used are designed to interfere with intracellular biochemical processes (7Arslan M.A. Kutuk O. Basaga H. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2006; 6: 623-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 8Malumbres M. Clin. Transl. Oncol. 2006; 8: 399-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Pommier Y. Curr. Med.

For instance, we recently demonstrated that delivery of the ribosome-inactivating protein Ricin-A efficiently destroys murine myeloma cells (11Firer M.A. Laptev R. Kasatkin I. Trombka D. Leuk. Lymphoma. 2003; 44: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and that targeted, chemiluminescent activation of the photodynamic process results in endomembrane destruction (12Laptev R. Nisnevitch M. Siboni G. Malik Z. Firer M.A. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 95: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The activity of these types of cytotoxic systems requires endocytosis, and this process often induces intracellular activation of resistance mechanisms (2Yang H.H. Ma M.H. Vescio R.A. Berenson J.R. J. Clin. Oncol. 2003; 21: 4239-4247Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There is therefore a need to expand the portfolio of cytotoxic agents, for instance to those whose mode of action is endocytosis-independent. Cyt1Aa is a plasma membrane-acting cytotoxin isolated from the paracrystalline δ-endotoxin of the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (Bti) 3The abbreviations used are: BtiB. thuringiensis israelensisMBPpmyelin basic protein peptideLTCligand-toxin conjugateFmocN-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonylFLFriend's erythroleukemiaMTT3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. (13Margalith Y. Ben-Dov E. Insect Pest Management: Techniques for Environmental Protection. CRC Press LLC, Boca Raton, FL2000: 243-304Google Scholar). It is a major component (45–50%) of the mosquito-larvicidal crystal proteins of Bti, displaying relatively low larvicidal activity per se but high synergy with other Bti toxins (14Crickmore N.

The alkali-solubilized protoxin form of Cyt1Aa (249 amino acids long; 27 kDa) is active against insect cells, erythrocytes, and mammalian cells in vitro without activation (21Koni P.A. Ellar D.J. Microbiology (Read.). 1994; 140: 1869-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), but specific proteolysis by trypsin, proteinase K, or endogenous proteases generates a carboxyl- and amino-terminated 22–25-kDa toxin that is three times more active (22Al-yahyaee S.A. Ellar D.J. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 3141-3148Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 23Butko P. Huang F. Pusztai-Carey M. Surewicz W.K. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 11355-11360Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The activity of Cyt1Aa appears to depend on its ability to form a multiunit complex that binds to and then becomes embedded in the plasma membrane, leading to membrane destruction and cell lysis (24Butko P. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2003; 69: 2415-2422Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 25Manceva S.D. Pusztai-Carey M. Russo P.S. Butko P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Some unsuccessful attempts have been made to exploit this activity. A Cyt1Aa-anti-Thy1.1 fusion protein, for example, lacked cytolytic specificity against a Thy 1.1-expressing mouse AKR-A/2 lymphoma cell line (26Al-yahyaee S.A. Ellar D.J. Bioconjugate Chem. 1996; 7: 451-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the same study, a Cyt1Aa-insulin conjugate displayed specificity for target cells overexpressing insulin receptors, but the activity level and response rate were lower than for the free Cyt1Aa. The reported lack of conjugated Cyt1Aa activity may be related to the site of toxin attachment to the targeting carrier that may result in interference of Cyt1Aa-membrane complex with the formation. This working hypothesis led us to compare several methods for preparing active ligand-toxin conjugates (LTCs) comprising Cyt1Aa. B. thuringiensis israelensis myelin basic protein peptide ligand-toxin conjugate N-(9-fluorenyl) methoxycarbonyl Friend's erythroleukemia 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Proteolytically activated Cyt1Aa was chemically conjugated via lysine residues to either the carboxyl or amino terminus of myelin basic protein peptide (MBPp) (amino acids 87–99). In parallel, fusion proteins were genetically engineered in which Cyt1Aa was linked in-frame to either the amino (cyt1Aa-MBPp) or carboxyl (MBPp-cyt1Aa) terminus of MBPp, and the clones were expressed via the pHT315 shuttle vector in acrystalliferous Bti. Cytotoxicities of the chemically and genetically prepared LTCs were compared against mouse B cell hybridoma cells that do or do not surface express and secrete IgM clonotypic anti-MBPp antibodies. The cytotoxicity and target cell specificity of the genetically modified versions were much higher than those of the chemically linked proteins. Cyt1Aa might thus be used as a cytotoxin for targeted destruction of malignant cells. Cells—Friend's erythroleukemia (FL) and U136 murine hybridoma B cells, which secrete non-relevant antibodies (kindly given by Prof. Zelig Eshhar, Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel), were used as well as M61.13 murine hybridoma B cells, which secrete and express on the cell membrane IgM antibodies to rat MBPp (amino acids 87–99, VHFFKNIVTPRTP, molecular mass 1.56 kDa) (kindly given by Prof. Michal Schwartz, Weizmann Institute of Science) and were used as the target cells.

All the plasmids were subcloned separately into XL1-Blue MRF′, purified, and electroporated into acrystalliferous Bti strain IPS78/11. Electroporation was performed in a 0.2-cm cuvette with either E. coli XL1-Blue MRF′ or acrystalliferous Bti IPS78/11 competent cells using a Bio-Rad MicroPulser electroporator apparatus setting at 2.5 kV (Ec2 program) and 1.8 kV (Ec1) for E. coli and Bti, respectively. The plasmids containing variants of cyt1Aa and cyt1Aa-MBPp and their encoding products (Fig. 1) are listed and described in Table 2. They were isolated from XL1-Blue MRF′ cells by the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega Madison, WI), sequenced, and electroporated into the acrystalliferous IPS78/11 strain of Bti. Plasmid DNA from Bti was alkali-purified (33Birnboim H.C. Doly J.

Screening for transformants was performed on Lysogeny broth plates containing 20 μg ml-1 erythromycin at 30 °C. Crystals were seen under a phase-contrast microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE2000-5 equipped with a Nikon Digital Sight DS-U1 CCD camera) at ×100 optical lens (oil).

The cultures were centrifuged, washed with double distilled water, and disrupted by sonication in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were separated on a semi-preparative 5–20% gradient of native PAGE. The appropriate size band was excised from the gel and eluted by a Gel-Eluter (Bio-Rad) apparatus. The presence of the Cyt1Aa protein was detected by Western blot analysis using anti-Cyt1Aa and anti-MBPp. Crystal Protein Purification—Bti strain IPS78/11 harboring cyt1Aa, with or without p20, was grown overnight in 5 ml of Lysogeny broth supplemented with 20 μg ml-1 erythromycin, transferred to 500 ml of CCY medium (30Stewart G.S. Johnstone K. Hagelberg E. Ellar D.J. Biochem. J. 1981; 198: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) with erythromycin, and grown with aeration at 30 °C for 4 days. Cultures were centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min, and the pellets containing crystals, spores, and cell debris were washed twice with cold water. The crystals were separated from the other components by sucrose discontinuous gradient as previously described (34Debro L. Fitz-James P.C. Aronson A. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 258-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Solubilization, Proteolytic Activation, and Purification of Activated Cyt1Aa—Cyt1Aa purified crystals were solubilized in 50 mm Na2CO3 buffer (pH 10.5) containing 10 mm dithiothreitol and 1 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 1 h, followed by lowering the pH to 8.5 and proteolytic processing with proteinase K at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Activated Cyt1Aa was purified by the anion exchange chromatography system (GE Healthcare) on a DEAE-cellulose column (1 × 25 cm), pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5, and eluted with a NaCl 0–0.6 m gradient in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1.5 ml min-1. Fractions (3 ml) were collected and monitored at 280 nm. Protein concentration, homogeneity, and hemolytic activity were determined for each fraction by A280 nm and the Lowry method (35Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7141) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Peptide Synthesis and Chemical Conjugation of Cyt1Aa-MBPp—Synthesis of MBPp was performed by the automated Fmoc solid phase method at BioSight Ltd., Karmiel, Israel. The peptides were synthesized using a double coupling of O-benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluro-phosphate and N-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate 5–10-fold excess with amino acid to resin substitution. Mix time for each coupling was 2–16 h. Wang resin was used in coupling for creation of free carboxyl at the carboxyl terminus of the peptide. Deprotection of Fmoc was performed using 20% piperdin in N,N-dimethylformamide. Cleavage was performed using 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% triisopropylsilane, and 2.5% water, mixed for 2 h. The peptides were precipitated with ether and dried. The peptides were dissolved in water, purified, frozen, and lyophilized under vacuum. Purified activated Cyt1Aa was concentrated by Amicon® concentrator (MWCO 10000) and conjugated with either of two variants of MBPp by commercial cross-linkers as follows. Conjugate 1 was prepared by linking the free carboxyl terminus of the MBPp variant 1 (VHFFKNIVTPRTP) with free amines of lysine residues along the cleaved Cyt1Aa by EDC (1-ethyl-3-[3-dimethylaminopropyl] carbodiimide hydrochloride) (Pierce). Conjugate 2 was prepared by linking the free–SH group of the cysteine residue in the terminus of MBPp variant 2 (CVHFFKNIVTPRTP) with free amines of lysine residues along the cleaved Cyt1Aa by the cross-linker MBS (m-maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (Pierce). The conjugation procedures were performed according to the Pierce manual with appropriate molar ratios that yield a minimum conjugation ratio of 1–2 MBPp:Cyt1Aa molecule. The MBPp variants and the conjugates were purified by reverse phase HPLC on LiChrosphere WP 300 RP-18 (125 × 5 mm, 5 μm; Merck) column in acetonitril/H2O. Cytotoxicity Assays—To establish dose-response curves for Cyt1Aa activity on hybridoma cells, log phase cells were washed twice with prewarmed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin but not horse serum (as recommended in Ref. 36Thomas W.E. Ellar D.J. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 60: 181-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 0.5–1 × 105 cells ml-1 either alone or together with various concentrations of Cyt1Aa conjugates. After 12 or 48 h (depending on the experiment), cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion or MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyldiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) test (37Mosmann T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1983; 65: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (46884) Google Scholar). Expression, Purification, and Activation of Cyt1Aa—The acrystalliferous Bti cells harboring pHT-cyAp20 (Fig. 1a) were grown in CCY sporulation medium. After 36 h the cells were lysed and the accumulated Cyt1Aa was released in the form of large parasporal bipyramidal crystals (∼1.5 μm) together with the spores (phase and electron micrographs are shown in the supplemental data). The Cyt1Aa crystals were purified by a sucrose gradient, solubilized, and the native protein proteolytically activated by 1% proteinase K. A major peak was eluted in the prewash fraction, but SDS-PAGE analysis showed that this material was not a protein. Four additional peaks were obtained, but only the first of these, that which eluted at ∼0.1 m NaCl, displayed high activity against red blood cells (Fig. 2A, +++). This fraction was also tested against M61.13 cells and showed LC50 of 0.3 μg ml-1 (Fig. 2B). This second peak contains only activated Cyt1Aa (∼22 kDa, Fig. 3A, lane 1) and was used for chemical conjugation to MBPp.FIGURE 3A, SDS-PAGE of the full-length and the proteolytic cleaved forms (∼22.5 kDa) of Cyt1Aa purified on a DEAE cellulose column.

Both conjugates caused decreased viability (MTT test) at doses above 3 μg ml-1. Values of LC50 were 6 and 5.5 μg ml-1 for conjugate 2 and conjugate 1, respectively (Fig. 4). The control cells were not affected under the same conditions. The kinetics of cytotoxicity induced by both conjugates was determined during incubation of 12.5 μg ml-1 for 1, 3, 24, and 48 h (Fig. 5). As expected, activated free Cyt1Aa was not specific, killing all three cell types with similar intensities. Conjugates 1 and 2 were not toxic for FL and U136 cells, but the target M61.13 cells were killed by either conjugate in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of killing was, however, lower than by free Cyt1Aa. Conjugate 2 appeared to be more effective than conjugate 1, but the differences were not significant. In the kinetic assay both conjugates were specifically toxic to M61.13 cells even after 1 h of incubation, and more than 65% of these cells were lysed after 24 h. The killing rate (∼90% of the cells) even after 48 h was less than that of free Cyt1Aa (Fig. 5). Genetic Fusion of Both Terminally Cleaved Cyt1Aa to MBPp—In addition to the chemically conjugated peptides, two variants were genetically constructed encoding Cyt1Aa fused to MBPp at the carboxyl or amino terminus (Fig. 1, b and c, respectively) and introduced to acrystalliferous Bti. All recombinant bacteria sporulated and lysed after 2 days in CCY medium, but no crystals were observed by phase microscopy. Bands with anticipated sizes were, however, detected by a Western blot analysis (Fig. 6) with anti-Cyt1Aa serum in lysates of 1-day cultures of sporulated Table 2) exhibited two bands on native and denatured PAGEs, corresponding to monomer and dimer (Fig. 7, A and B).FIGURE 7Dose-survival curve of M61.13 target cells (A), U136 cells (B), and FL control cells (C) following treatment with elevated concentrations of recombinant fragments. b, Cyt1Aa-MBPp, ♦; c, MBPp-Cyt1Aa, ▪; d, Cyt1Aa, ▴.

The cells were cultured without serum together with toxin fragments b (Cyt1Aa-MBPp), c (MBPp-Cyt1Aa), or d (free Cyt1Aa) (Table 2 and Fig. 1, b–d), and cell viability was determined by MTT test after 16 h. Fragment b was the most cytotoxic to M61.13 target cells (Fig. 7A), LC50 ≅ 180 ng ml-1 compared with 260 and 360 ng ml-1 of fragments c and d, respectively. Conversely, fragment b was not toxic to U136 and FL cell lines (Fig. 7, A and B, respectively). Fragment d (free Cyt1Aa) showed nonspecific cytotoxicity and had a similar toxicity (LC50 range between 340 and 360 ng ml-1) against all the cell types tested. The Toxicity of Partially Cleaved Cyt1Aa—To assess whether cleavages at both the amino and carboxyl termini are necessary for optimal activity of Cyt1Aa, seven additional constructs designated e–k were prepared (Table 2 and Fig. 1, e–k) that express (under cyt1Aa promoter) p20 and cyt1Aa or cyt1Aa-MBP variants, cleaved at one terminus only. When introduced into acrystalliferous Bti cells, none of these variants produced crystals, but their lysates contained soluble fragments as detected by anti-Cyt1Aa antibod"
https://openalex.org/W1986420497,"70-kDa heat shock protein family is a molecular chaperone that binds to a variety of client proteins and peptides in the cytoplasm. Several studies have revealed binding motifs between 70-kDa heat shock protein family and cytoplasmic proteins by conventional techniques such as phage display library screening. However, little is known about the binding motif based on kinetic parameters determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis. We investigated the major inducible cytosolic 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70)-binding motif with the human leukocyte antigen B*2702-derived peptide Bw4 (RENLRIALRY) by using a Biacore system based on surface plasmon resonance analysis. The KD value of Hsp70-Bw4 interaction was 1.8 × 10-6 m. Analyses with truncated Bw4 variant peptides showed the binding motif of Hsp70 to be seven residues, LRIALRY. To further study the characteristics of this motif, 126 peptides derived from Bw4, each with single amino acid substitution, were synthesized and analyzed for Hsp70 binding affinity. Interestingly, the Hsp70 binding affinity was abrogated when the residues were substituted for by acidic (Asp and Glu) ones at any position. In contrast, if the substitute residue was aromatic (Trp, Tyr, and Phe) or an Arg residue at any position, Hsp70 binding affinity was maintained. Thus, this study presents a new binding motif between Hsp70 and peptides derived from the natural protein human leukocyte antigen B*2702 and may also elucidate some characteristics of the Hsp70 binding characteristic, enhancing our understanding of Hsp70-binding determinants that may influence diverse cellular and physiological processes. 70-kDa heat shock protein family is a molecular chaperone that binds to a variety of client proteins and peptides in the cytoplasm.

Molecular chaperones of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family perform numerous functions in the quality control of cells that mediate protein folding, translocation, assembly/disassembly, and repair of unfolded proteins damaged by environmental stress (1Bukau B. Horwich Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). Chaperone activity of this protein family is necessary to recognize binding sites of a target native protein, referred to as the binding motif. It has been reported that the endoplasmic reticulum 70-kDa heat shock protein Bip (Grp78) binds to a peptide containing at least seven residues with maximal affinity in the presence of ATPase activity (2Flynn G. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 3Gething M-J. Blond-Elguindi S. Buchner J. Fourie A. Knarr G. Modrow S. Nanu L. Segal M. Sambrook J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was also suggested that peptide-binding sites of Bip show a preference for sequences rich in aliphatic residues. Subsequently, from a study employing a phage display library, the binding motif for Bip was revealed to be a heptapeptide with high contents of aromatic and hydrophobic residues (4Blond-Elguindi S.

On the other hand, the bacterial cytoplasmic 70-kDa heat shock protein homolog DnaK has a substrate-binding region in the C terminus, and repeated binding/release to substrates is dependent on the ATPase cycle at an ATPase domain of the N terminus (5Szabo A.

Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) reported a crystal structure of the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of DnaK, which was located in a hydrophobic substrate-binding cleft with a central pocket placed between a β sheet and two α helices. The consensus motif recognized by DnaK consisted of peptides comprising a hydrophobic core of 4–5 residues flanked by basic residues (8Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Moreover, in virus-infected cells, it is well known that a 60-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp60) 2The abbreviations used are:Hspheat shock proteinHscheat shock cognate proteinSPRsurface plasmon resonanceHLAhuman leukocyte antigenRUresonance unit and a 90-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp90) bind to hepatitis B virus-derived proteins such as polymerase and transcriptase (9Hu J.

Recently, it was reported that the host major inducible cytosolic 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70)-binding motif interacted with a heptapeptide from a nucleoprotein of measles virus (11Zhang X.

Thus, the 70-kDa heat shock protein family is capable of recognizing and binding not only to the structural region of a protein but also to a specific localized peptide motif. heat shock protein heat shock cognate protein surface plasmon resonance human leukocyte antigen resonance unit Although 70-kDa heat shock protein family-binding motifs derived from observations of interactions with its many substrate proteins have been proposed, little is known about the binding motif based on kinetic parameters determined by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. Because target molecules basically bind to 70-kDa heat shock protein in low affinity interactions, it might be difficult to measure binding interaction by conventional methods such as competitive immunoprecipitation. The use of SPR technology, on which bimolecular interaction analysis (Biacore) is based, provides us with the most expedient approach for measurement of low affinity protein interactions in real time. With the Biacore system, one interaction partner is conjugated on the surface of a sensor chip (ligand), and other binding partners flow over the surface (analyte), facilitating analysis of binding differences between multiple analytes and a single ligand. In this study, we investigated the interaction of Hsp70 with the HLA-B*2702-derived peptide Bw4 (RENLRIALRY, HLA-B*2702 amino acids 75–84) and its various truncated and substituted peptides using a Biacore system. Nössner et al. (14Nössner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that Bw4 can bind to Hsp70 and 70-kDa heat shock cognate protein (Hsc70) and elicit a suppressive effect on T cell function. Because the Hsp70-binding motif basically is a heptapeptide, the aim of this study was to find a new Hsp70-binding motif and its biologic characteristics, if present, using the Biacore system. Consequently, we demonstrated that Hsp70 bound to Bw4 with KD = 1.8 × 10-6 m. Using truncated and Ala-substituted variants of Bw4, the Hsp70-binding motif of Bw4 was newly found to be heptapeptide LRIALRY. Moreover, we found that if residues in this motif were substituted for by an aromatic (Trp, Tyr, and Phe) or Arg residue at any position, Hsp70 binding affinity was maintained, whereas with acidic residue substitutions, binding affinity to Hsp70 was markedly decreased. The present study suggests a new binding motif between human Hsp70 and peptides derived from natural protein HLA-B*2702 and also discloses characteristics of the Hsp70-binding motif structure. Our findings may contribute to enhanced understanding of 70-kDa heat shock protein family binding determinants that may influence diverse cellular and physiological processes. 70-kDa Heat Shock Proteins and Synthetic Peptides—Recombinant human Hsp70 protein (NSP-555), the endoplasmic reticulum 70-kDa heat shock protein Bip (Grp78) (SPP-765), and Escherichia coli DnaK protein (SPP-630) were purchased from StressGen (Victoria, Canada). All of the peptides were synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich. The peptides were dissolved with 5% Me2SO (Merck) in phosphate-buffered saline at the indicated concentrations in each experiment. Surface Plasmon Resonance Analysis using the Biacore System—SPR experiments were performed with a Biacore 3000 system (Biacore, Inc., Uppsala Sweden). With this system, molecules of interest (ligands) are immobilized on a sensor surface, and binding partners (analytes) can then be passed over it in a mobile aqueous phase. Their interaction on the sensor surface can subsequently be monitored in real time without the use of labels. To investigate Hsp70-, Bip-, and DnaK-peptide interactions, we employed Hsp70, Bip, and DnaK proteins as ligands that were immobilized on the sensor surface, and Bw4 (RENLRIALRY, HLA-B*2702 amino acids 75–84) and Bw6 (RESLRNLRGY, HLA-B*0701 amino acids 75–84) peptides as the analytes. It is known that Bw4, but not Bw6, can bind to Hsp70/Hsc70 and elicit a suppressive effect on T cells (14Nössner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, truncated and amino acid-substituted peptides of Bw4 also were used as analytes. Hsp70, Bip, and DnaK were immobilized by amine coupling methods, according to the instruction manual for the Biacore 3000, which utilizes a primary amino group of proteins for covalent attachment to the matrix. Briefly, a dextran layer on a sensor chip that is covalently attached to a carboxymethylated dextran gold surface (CM5 sensor chip; Biacore, Inc.) was activated by injection of a mixture of N-hydroxysuccinmide and carbodiimide, creating a reactive ester on the surface for 10 min. Subsequently, 100 μl of 20 μg/ml ligand in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.5) was injected for 10 min and loaded with 1 m ethanolamine for 10 min to block binding to remaining nonreacted ester groups. Finally, the chip surface was washed with running buffer (5% Me2SO, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 2.5 mm ATP (disodium salt; Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline) to remove any loosely bound ligands. The amounts of immobilized Hsp70, Bip, and DnaK as ligands were 19,000, 14,347, and 7,843 resonance units (RU), respectively, corresponding to sensor surface areas of ∼19, 14.3, and 7.8 ng/mm2, respectively. To estimate these ligand-peptide interactions, the affinity of the interaction, i.e. the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD), was determined from the level of binding at equilibrium as a function of the sample concentrations by BIAevalution version 4.1 software (Biacore, Inc.). All of the peptides were dissolved with running buffer including 5% Me2SO, and binding experiments were performed at 25 °C in running buffer with a flow rate of 20 μl/min. To reduce errors in reference subtraction, solvent effects were compensated for by a Me2SO calibration procedure according to the BIAcore manufacturer's instructions. All of the peptide responses were corrected for Me2SO bulk differences via the Me2SO calibration curves that were obtained by the Me2SO calibration procedures performed at the beginning and end of each experiment. The Biacore assay based on SPR was used to monitor the Hsp70-, Bip-, and DnaK-peptide interactions. SPR detects molecular interactions because there is a corresponding change in the refractive index if binding occurs as a peptide passes over a prepared sensor surface. The responses on the sensorgram are designated RU. We initially attempted to estimate the binding affinity between Hsp70 and the Bw4 or Bw6 peptide. Each peptide was injected at a concentration of 50 μm for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to detect the association phase and loaded with running buffer alone on the sensor chip for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min to detect the dissociation phase. As shown in Fig. 1A, the immobilized Hsp70 on the sensor chip bound to Bw4 peptide, whereas Bw6 exhibited low binding compared with the Hsp70-Bw4 interaction. Bw4 binding to Hsp70 tended to be extremely fast, reaching equilibrium immediately after Bw4 peptide injection, and the complex dissociated just as quickly when the flow was switched to a running buffer, with RU returning to the basal level. Therefore, it was difficult to calculate the kinetic parameters (Ka and Kd) directly. The affinity of interaction was determined from the level of binding at equilibrium as a function of the sample concentration, which is referred to as the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD). We attempted to estimate the binding affinity in the Hsp70-Bw4 interaction. Bw4 peptide in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 12.5 μm was injected over an Hsp70 sensor chip for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min and loaded with running buffer alone for 2 min at the same flow rate. Association and dissociation phases of the Hsp70-Bw4 interaction at each concentration were shown to occur in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). Subsequently, kinetic analysis based on these data were performed, and the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) was determined using BIAevalution (version 4.1) software. As shown in Fig. 1C, a specific binding response between Hsp70 and Bw4 was observed, and the estimated KD for binding was 1.8 × 10-6 m. On the other hand, as shown in Fig. 1D, the estimated KD for binding between Hsp70 and Bw6 in the same manner was found to be 4.12 × 10-3 m, indicating that this binding affinity was ∼440-fold lower than the Hsp70-Bw4 interaction. We also tried to determine whether peptide binding affinity to isotypes of the 70-kDa heat shock protein family such as mammalian endoplasmic reticulum-resident Bip and prokaryotic DnaK molecules was different from Hsp70-Bw4 or -Bw6 interactions. As shown in Fig. 2 (A and B), it was somewhat surprising that the estimated KD values for binding of Bw4 to Bip and DnaK were 3.72 × 10-3 m and 1.85 × 10-4 m, respectively, indicating that Bip and DnaK had low binding affinity as compared with Hsp70. In terms of interactions with Bw6, the estimated KD values for binding to Bip and DnaK were 9.0 × 10-4 m and 4.83 × 10-3 m, respectively (Fig. 2, C and D). To investigate characteristics of the binding motif of Hsp70-Bw4 interaction, truncated Bw4 variant peptides were employed. The truncated Bw4 peptides presented in Table 1 were injected over an Hsp70 sensor chip in a similar manner. Truncated 9-, 8-, and 7-mer Bw4 peptides from which N-terminal Arg, Arg-Glu, and Arg-Glu-Asn residues were deleted, respectively, interacted with Hsp70 with high affinity (KD < 5 × 10-6 m), as did the wild type, but 6-mer (or fewer) peptides could not bind (KD > 1 × 10-3 m) to Hsp70 (Table 1). In contrast, truncated Bw4 peptides with deletion of only a C-terminal Tyr did not show interaction with Hsp70 (KD > 1 × 10-3 m), indicating that a C-terminal Tyr residue was critical for binding to Hsp70 and that the end of the binding motif of the C terminus seemed to be Tyr-84 of HLA-B*2702. Therefore, the Hsp70-binding motif interacting with Bw4 was 7-mer amino acid residues, LRIALRY, designated N3-Bw4. We also determined the KD value of this peptide. As shown in Fig. 3, the KD for binding between Hsp70 and N3-Bw4 peptide was estimated to be 2.6 × 10-6 m.TABLE 1Binding assay of truncated Bw4 peptidesNameSequence of truncated peptideBinding affinity (KD)mBw4RENLRIALRY1.8 × 10–6N1-Bw4ENLRIALRY1.9 × 10–6N2-Bw4NLRIALRY1.3 × 10–6N3-Bw4LRIALRY2.6 × 10–6N4-Bw4RIALRY>10–3N5-Bw4IALRY>10–3C1-Bw4RENLRIALR>10–3C2-Bw4RENLRIAL>10–3C3-Bw4RENLRIA>10–3C4-Bw4RENLRI>10–3C5-Bw4RENLR>10–3 Open table in a new tab Next, key amino acid residues in the motif of Bw4 binding to Hsp70 were studied using synthetic alanine-substituted peptides. Nine of these peptides were loaded over an Hsp70 sensor chip as above. We found that R1A, E2A, and N3A peptides that substituted for alanine at Arg-1, Glu-2, and Asn-3, respectively, maintained high affinities (KD < 5 × 10-6 m), like the wild type (Table 2), indicating that three N-terminal residues without binding motifs could not influence Hsp70 binding affinity. However, other alanine substitutions at L4A, R5A, I6A, L8A, R9A, and Y10A resulted in loss of binding (KD > 1 × 10-3 m) to Hsp70 (Table 2). Thus, it was demonstrated that each amino acid residue in the binding motif LRIALRY was critical for binding of Hsp70-Bw4 peptides.TABLE 2Binding assay of Ala-substituted peptidesNameSequence of alanine substitutionBinding affinity (KD)mBw4RENLRIALRY1.8 × 10–6Bw4-R1AAENLRIALRY1.1 × 10–6Bw4-E2ARANLRIALRY1.4 × 10–6Bw4-N3AREALRIALRY2.2 × 10–6Bw4-L4ARENARIALRY>10–3Bw4-R5ARENLAIALRY>10–3Bw4-I6ARENLRAALRY>10–3Bw4-L8ARENLRIAARY>10–3Bw4-R9ARENLRIALAY>10–3Bw4-Y10ARENLRIALRA>10–3 Open table in a new tab Subsequently, characteristics of the Hsp70-peptide-binding motif were investigated using a peptide array. An array of single amino acid-substituted peptides, which consisted of 126 peptides, of Bw4 wild peptide (10-mer peptide), was synthesized. For example, in the case of substituted peptides at position 8 of the N terminus, a Leu residue was substituted for by 18 amino acid residues: L8W, -Y, -F, -R, -K, -H, -M, -I, -V, -T, -A, -Q, -G, -P, -N, -S, -D, and -E. Cys substitutions were not performed in this study to avoid multimerization among substituted peptides by S-S binding. All of the peptides were loaded over an Hsp70 sensor chip in a similar manner. As shown in Fig. 4, single amino acid-substituted peptides in white squares represent the high affinity with Hsp70 (KD < 5 × 10-6 m), whereas peptides in blue squares represent decreased binding affinity (KD > 1 × 10-3 m). Peptides, except for R5Y, with aromatic residues (Trp, Tyr, and Phe) and Arg substitution showed high affinity with Hsp70, like the wild type, at any position, whereas acidic residue (Asp and Glu)-substituted peptides lost their binding affinity (KD > 1 × 10-3 m). The estimated KD values for binding between the Hsp70 and five peptides with aromatic Ile or Arg substituted at position 8 are shown in Fig. 5. These peptides in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 12.5 μm, were injected over an Hsp70 sensor chip for 2 min at a flow rate of 20 μl/min and loaded with running buffer alone for 2 min at the same flow rate. Specific binding affinity interaction between Hsp70 and these peptides was observed, and the estimated KD values for binding of L8Y, -W, -F, -R, and -I were 6.7, 1.1, 1.4, 1.4, and 1.8 × 10-6 m, respectively, indicating binding affinity mostly similar to the wild type. Thus, as shown in Fig. 6, it appears that aromatic and Arg residues are favored residues for interaction with Hsp70, whereas acidic residues are not favored.FIGURE 6Schematic illustration of the peptide-binding motif to human Hsp70. Aromatic and Arg residues are substitutable residues that could preserve high affinity to Hsp70, suggesting that they are favored residues. In contrast, substitutions with acidic residues resulted in loss of binding affinity, suggesting that they are disfavored residues.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The present study demonstrated, by SPR analysis, a new HLA-derived heptapeptide-binding motif, LRIALRY, interacting with human Hsp70. Nössner et al. (14Nössner E. Goldberg J.E. Naftzger C. Lyu S.C. Clayberger C. Krensky A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) reported that the Bw4 peptide bound to Hsp70/Hsc70 and elicited a suppressive effect on T cell function. Bw4, consisting of a 10-mer peptide, is derived from the most polymorphic region in the α1 domain of HLA-B*2702, where it is important for self and nonself recognition by T cell receptors. We focused on the interactions of human Hsp70 with native Bw4 and its truncated and amino acid-substituted variants, because peptides bound to Hsp70 are postulated to have immunomodulatory effects such as T cell tolerance or activation in transplantation and tumor immunity. For example, it was reported that the 70-kDa heat shock proteins, Hsp70/Hsc70 bound to HLA-DRB1-derived peptide sequences comprising the shared epitope, such as HLA-DRB1*040165–77(KDLLEQKRAAVDT) and -DRB1*010165–77(KDLLEQRRAAVDT), which are considered to be associated with an increased risk for rheumatoid arthritis. This might be attributed to the enhanced activation of CD4+ T cells against Hsp70/Hsc70-chaperoned antigen peptides via autophagy (15Gregersen P. Silver J. Winchester R.J. Arthritis Rheum. 1987; 30: 1205-1213Crossref PubMed Scopus (2105) Google Scholar, 16Maier J.T. Haug M. Foll J.L. Beck H. Kalbacher H. Rammensee H.G. Dannecker G.E.

Immunol. 2007; 37: 1053-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Thus, the interaction between 70-kDa heat shock protein family and HLA molecules seems to provide some biological insights (18Morimoto R.I. Tissiéres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. 1994; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 111-284Google Scholar, 19Pockey A.G.

In searching for the peptide-binding motifs for the 70-kDa heat shock protein family, it was first reported that an endoplasmic reticulum protein, Bip, could bind to peptides containing at least seven residues with maximal affinity in the presence of ATPase activity (2Flynn G. Pohl J. Flocco M.T. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1991; 353: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 3Gething M-J. Blond-Elguindi S. Buchner J. Fourie A. Knarr G. Modrow S. Nanu L. Segal M. Sambrook J. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 417-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was also indicated that the peptide-binding site of Bip showed a preference for sequences rich in aliphatic residues. Subsequently, from a study employing phage display library screening, the binding motif for Bip was revealed to be a heptapeptide with high contents of aromatic and hydrophobic residues (4Blond-Elguindi S. Cwirla S.E. Dower W.J. Lipshutz R.J. Sprang S.R. Sambrook J.F. Gething M.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 717-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). In the heptapeptide sequence, it was suggested that aromatic and hydrophobic residues occupied alternating positions. On the other hand, bacterial cytoplasmic 70-kDa heat shock protein homolog DnaK has a substrate-binding region in the C terminus, and repeated binding/release to substrates is dependent on the ATPase cycle at the ATPase domain of the N terminus (5Szabo A. Langer T. Schröder H. Flanagan J. Bukau B. Hartl F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10345-10349Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 6Buchberger A. Schröder H. Hesterkamp T. Schönfeld H-J. Bukau B. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Zhu et al. (7Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar) reported the crystal structure of the C-terminal substrate-binding domain of DnaK, which was located in a hydrophobic substrate-binding cleft with a central pocket placed between a β sheet and two α helices. Basically, this domain is considered to bind to substrates by making hydrogen bonds (22Rüdiger S. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In addition, it was reported that a consensus motif recognized by DnaK consisted of peptides comprising a hydrophobic core of 4–5 residues flanked by basic residues (8Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In the current study, the binding motif of the HLA-derived protein LRIALRY consisted of a hydrophobic core of 3 residues flanked by basic Arg residues. Although such characteristics appeared to be similar to the consensus motif of DnaK, it was interesting that DnaK-Bw4 interaction was ∼500-fold lower than Hsp70-Bw4 interaction. The substrate-binding domain of Hsp70 shares ∼50% homology in its amino acid sequence with DnaK (18Morimoto R.I. Tissiéres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. 1994; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 111-284Google Scholar, 23Hunt C. Morimoto R.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 6455-6459Crossref PubMed Scopus (701) Google Scholar). These structural differences might result in differences of binding affinity. For example, Fourie et al. (24Fourie A.M. Sambrooks J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) investigated the binding of 36 peptides to Hsc70, Bip, and DnaK by competition assay, demonstrating that there was little common peptide bound to these three proteins with similar binding affinity. It was also reported that mutant p53 protein-derived V10 peptide (substitution of Cys-126 by Tyr) was bound to Bip and DnaK but that V10-Hsc70 interaction was weaker than Bip and DnaK interaction (24Fourie A.M. Sambrooks J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In our Biacore study, this appeared to be true, because the KD values for binding of Bip and DnaK to V10 peptide were estimated to be 4.28 × 10-5 m and 2.26 × 10-5 m, respectively. In contrast, that of Hsp70-V10 peptide was markedly lower (KD > 1 × 10-3 m) than the Bip-and DnaK-V10 interaction (data not shown), which was consistent with their data (24Fourie A.M. Sambrooks J.F. Gething M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30470-30478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is known that Hsp70/Hsc70 have very similar biochemical functions and are highly homologous proteins in their primary amino acid sequence except for a short heterologous C-terminal portion with an unknown biochemical function (18Morimoto R.I. Tissiéres A. Georgopoulos C. The Biology of Heat Shock Proteins and Molecular Chaperones. 1994; (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY): 111-284Google Scholar, 23Hunt C.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5181-5197Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 26Milner C.M. Campbell R.D.

Immunity. 2004; 20: 95-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Therefore, although we did not confirm the interaction between Hsc70 and V10 peptide, it is highly likely that this interaction could occur similarly to that of Hsp70 and V10 peptide in our current Biacore system. In the peptide array experiments, when a residue in the LRIALRY motif was substituted for by an acidic residue, the binding affinity to Hsp70 was reduced in all cases. In the case of DnaK, acidic residues were excluded from cores and were found to be disfavored in the flanking region when 4360 peptides derived from 37 biologically relevant proteins were screened (8Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). In addition, Zhang and Oglesbee (13Zhang X. Oglesbee M. Biol. Proced. Online. 2003; 5: 170-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported similar results in which substitutions with acidic residues markedly reduced binding affinity to Hsp70. Thus, acidic residues appear to be disfavored in binding to the human 70-kDa heat shock protein family. Meanwhile, it was reported that Hsp70 and Hsp90 could transfer peptides produced by the ubiquitin-proteasome system from the cytoplasmic milieu to the endoplasmic reticulum via transporters associated with antigen processing but not by natural diffusion (28Li Z. Srivastava P.K. Behring Inst. 1994; 94: 37-47PubMed Google Scholar, 29Nieland T.J.F. Tan M.C.A. Monne-van Muijien M. Koning F. Kruisbeek A.M. Van Bleek G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6135-6139Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). These peptides were then bound to an endoplasmic reticulum-resident chaperone, GP96, and loaded onto major histocompatibility complex class I molecules in the endoplasmic reticulum (30Lammert E. Arnold D. Nijenhuis M. Momburg F. Hammerling G.J. Brunner J. Stevanovic S. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 923-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 31Spee P. Neefjes J.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It was also reported that peptides bound to Hsp70 in tumor cells were identified as tumor antigens and that the purified tumor-derived Hsp70-peptide complex elicited tumor-specific cytotoxic T cell immunity in vitro and in vivo (33Tamura Y. Peng P. Liu K. Daou M. Srivastava P.K. Science. 1997; 278: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 34Sato K. Torimoto Y. Tamura Y. Shindo M. Shinzaki H. Hirai K. Kohgo Y.

Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). We showed here that the new Hsp70-binding motif was a heptapeptide, LRIALRY. Interestingly, in this motif, aromatic residues or an Arg residue could be substituted at any position. These data might help elucidate the interaction of this motif with tumor antigens and suggest the possibility of construction of immunomodulatory cancer vaccines (35Belli F. Testori A. Rivoltini L. et al.J. Clin. Oncol. 2002; 20: 4169-4180Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 36Qian J. Wang S. Yang J. Xie J. Lin P. Freeman M.E. II I Yi Q. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 8808-8815Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Our study may also have several biologic implications. When we searched for homologous proteins with the Swiss-Prot data base, there were many such proteins with the same sequence in their primary amino acids as the LRIALRY motif. The majority of these proteins included HLA class I heavy chain molecules such as A*23, A*24, A*25, A*32, B*38, B*49, B*51, B*52, B*53, B*57, B*58, and B*59. When we extended the search for homologous sequences of proteins with residues favored in the motif as illustrated in Fig. 6, there were many human housekeeping proteins such as Hsp40 homologs, α adrenergic receptors, adenylate cyclase, protein ariadne-2, collagen α-3 chain receptor, acetyl-CoA carboxylases, HLA class IIDQ4, DQ-DRW9, tyrosine-protein kinase JAK2, and many other proteins, and the number of such molecules was at least more than 317. In case of Hsp40 homologs among these 317 molecules, recent studies suggested that these protein-derived peptides efficiently activated CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (37Prakken B.J. Samodal R. Le T.D. Giannoni F. Yung G.P. Scavulli J. Amox D. Roord S. Kleer I. Bonnin D. Lanza P. Berry C. Massa M. Billetta R. Albani S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Martini A. Albani S. Arthritis Rheum. 2007; 56: 1648-1657Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, one explanation for these data is that successful induction of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells might be attributable to Hsp40-derived peptides that could bind to Hsp70 with high affinity. Although the biologic significance of the current peptide-binding motif to Hsp70 is not yet clear, one immunological speculation is intriguing. There is a possibility that Hsp70-chaperoned peptides with our current motif may preferentially enter into the endoplasmic reticulum, make complexes with peptide-HLA class I, and subsequently be expressed on the cell surface. If these interactions happen in the thymus, our current observations might be compatible with the efficient induction of the negative selection of T cells, because peptides with this motif can be derived from not only self HLA class I heavy chains themselves but also many sets of self-housekeeping proteins.

However, the crystal structure and protease susceptibility studies suggest that these C-terminal residues may associate with the bicyclic core as an α-helix (7Skolovsky M. Galron R. Kloog Y.

Ponticos M. Nagase H. Curr. Vasc. Pharmacol. 2005; 3: 369-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In humans, these biological activities are mediated via the endothelin receptors, ETA and ETB. ETB receptors bind ETs and Srts with little selectivity, whereas ETA receptors show greater affinity for ET-1, ET-2, and Srt b, over ET-3 and Srt c (5Cody W.L. Doherty A.M. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The flexible C-terminal hexapeptide residues, especially Trp21, have been found to be critical for high affinity binding to ETA and ETB (10Gray G.A. Webb D.J. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 72: 109-148Google Scholar), and truncated peptides containing this region in isolation are effective antagonists of ET binding to both receptor types (5Cody W.L. Doherty A.M. Biopolymers. 1995; 37: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are a group of high affinity endogenous inhibitors of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and some disintegrin metalloproteinases (ADAM and ADAMTSs). TIMPs have an integral role in regulating MMP activities, and an appropriate balance between TIMPs and active MMPs is crucial for ECM homoeostasis. Active MMPs have important physiological roles in embryonic development and wound healing, but excess MMP activity has been linked to pathological conditions including arthritis, cardiovascular disease, and tumor cell metastasis (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Because the TIMPs play a key role in modulating metalloproteinase activity, they offer a potential route for therapeutic intervention in these diseases (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar, 12Kashiwagi M. Tortorella M. Nagase H. Brew K. J. Biol.

The four TIMPs found in mammals (TIMP-1–4) have overlapping inhibitory specificities and together regulate the activities of more than 30 metalloproteinases in humans (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). Mammalian TIMPs are two-domain molecules, having a larger N-terminal domain (∼120 amino acids) and a smaller C-terminal domain of ∼65 residues; each domain is stabilized by three disulfide bonds. The MMP inhibitory activity is located in the N-terminal domain and recombinant forms of the truncated N-terminal domains of TIMPs (N-TIMPs) fold independently and are fully active as metalloproteinase inhibitors (11Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim Biophys Acta. 2000; 1477: 267-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1584) Google Scholar). The crystallographic structure of the TIMP-1/MMP-3 complex indicated that ∼75% of the intermolecular contacts of the TIMP-1 component with MMP-3 are made by the residues surrounding the Cys1–Cys70 disulfide bond, specifically residues 1–5 and 66–70 (14Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R. Suzuki K. Yoshida N. Nagase H. Brew K. Bourenkov G.P. Bartunik H. Bode W. Nature. 1997; 389: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Similar contacts were observed subsequently in the structure of complexes of TIMP-2 with MMP-14 (15Fernandez-Catalan C. Bode W. Huber R. Turnk D. Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1997; 17: 5238-5248Crossref Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and MMP-13 (16Maskos K. Lang R. Tschesche H. Bode W. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 366: 1222-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and the complex of N-TIMP-1 with MMP-1 (17Iyer S. Wei S. Brew K. Acharya K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 364-371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To develop their potential as therapeutic agents while minimizing deleterious side effects, N-TIMPs have been successfully engineered by mutation of their MMP interaction sites to enhance their inhibitory selectivity for different metalloproteinases (18Meng Q. Malinovskii V.A. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 19Nagase H.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22086-22091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, there are many advantages associated with engineering a smaller peptide inhibitor of metalloproteinases if a TIMP-like scaffold can be identified. In relation to this possibility, we noticed a topological similarity between ETs and the core of the MMP interaction site of TIMP (see Fig. 1). ETs and Srts are generated in vivo by proteolytic cleavage from larger precursors. However, previous studies have shown that they can be produced by solid phase peptide synthesis and fold spontaneously in vitro in high yield into native tertiary structures with the correct disulfide bond pairing of cysteines. Also, a number of ET variants have been produced that retain the ability to fold correctly (21Ramalingam K. Snyder G.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11155-11161Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 22Nakajima K. Kumagaye S-i. Nishio H. Kuroda H. Watanabe T.X. Kobayashi Y. Tamaoki H. Kimura T. Sakakibara S. J.

Int. 1990; 21: 1051-1057PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that the ET scaffold is robust and is an appropriate starting point for the design of small topologically defined peptides with possible metalloproteinase inhibitory activities. Our initial studies showed that Srt6b has some inhibitory activity toward MMP-2 and MMP-3 leading to an investigation of peptides based on Srt6b that are modified to greatly reduce or eliminate their potentially toxic vasopressive activity. Although initial changes of this type also largely eliminated MMP inhibitory activity, we were able to incorporate further changes that enhance selective inhibitory activity toward MMPs, producing inhibitors with Ki values of ∼1 μm. Structural characterization by circular dichroism and NMR indicates that the inhibitors have solution structures that are similar to Srt and ET but with increased helical content. The effects of structural changes and molecular docking studies support the view that Srt variants may act in a manner analogous to TIMPs. All of the standard chemicals were peptide synthesis or molecular biology grade and were purchased from Fisher. 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, and Fmoc amino acid derivatives were obtained from Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). The substrates for MMP assays, NFF-3 (Mca-RPKPVE-Nva-WRK(Dnp)-OH) for MMP-3 and Knight substrate (Mca-KPLGL-K(Dnp)AR-NH2) for MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-14, were prepared and characterized as described (25Knight C.G. Willenbrock F. Murphy G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 296: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 26Nagase H. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20952-20957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ADAM-17 substrate (Mca-PLAQAV-Dpa-RSS-NH2) was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The ADAMTS-4 substrate, which incorporates an ELE↓GR cleavage motif has been described previously (27Lauer-Fields J.L. Minond D. Sritharan T. Kashiwagi M. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 142-150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Peptide Synthesis—Peptide-resin assembly was performed by Fmoc solid phase methodology on an ABI 433A peptide synthesizer (28Lauer-Fields J.L. Broder T. Sritharan T. Nagase H. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5795-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Cleavage and side chain deprotection of peptideresins proceeded for at least 2 h using Reagent K, phenolthioanisole-water-ethanedithiol-trifluoroacetic acid (5:5:5:2.5: 82.5) (29King D.S. Fields C.G. Fields G.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1990; 36: 255-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Cleavage solutions were extracted with methyl t-butyl ether prior to purification. Limited combinatorial libraries of peptides were generated by mixing Fmoc-protected amino acids in appropriate ratios to produce equimolar coupling based on the work of Ostresh et al. (30Ostresh J.M. Winkle J.H. Hamashin V.T. Houghten R.A. Biopolymers. 1994; 34: 1681-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Peptide Folding and Purification—Crude peptides were dissolved in 1 mm 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol in 0.1 m NH4HCO3, pH 8.5, and mixed 1–18 h at 4 °C. Disulfide bond formation was monitored by analytical RP-HPLC based on the observation that oxidized endothelin model peptides elute earlier than reduced peptides (18Meng Q. Malinovskii V.A. Huang W. Hu Y. Chung L. Nagase H. Bode W. Maskos K. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10184-10189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 23Atkins A.R. Ralston G.B. Smith R. Int. J. Peptide Protein Res. 1994; 44: 372-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). RP-HPLC was performed with a Hewlett-Packard 1100 liquid chromatograph equipped with a Vydac 218TP5415 C18 RP column (5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 150 × 4.6 mm). Eluants were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water (Solvent A) and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile (Solvent B). The column was eluted with a gradient from 0–60% B in 25 min at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min, and eluted peptides were detected by UV absorbance at λ = 220 and 280 nm. The peptides were purified using a Rainin Auto-Prep system with a Vydac C18 column (15–20-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size, 250 × 22 mm) at a flow rate of 10.0 ml/min using the same eluants; the elution gradient was adjusted as required. Most of the cysteine-containing peptides folded into two forms separable by RP-HPLC. The earlier eluting fraction was found to contain the correctly folded peptide. Thus, fractions containing homogenous products were identified by a combination of analytical RP-HPLC and MALDI-TOF MS. Peptide Characterization—MALDI-TOF MS was performed with an Applied Biosystems Voyager DE-STR MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer using an α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (31Lauer-Fields J.L. Nagase H. Fields G.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 2000; 890: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sulfydryl content was determined with 5-5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) using a d/l-cysteine standard curve (32Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21218) Google Scholar, 33Bulaj G. Kortemme T. Goldenberg D.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8965-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Disulfide bond connectivity was assigned by partial reduction using tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine and derivatization with N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (34van den Hooven H. van den Burg H.A. Vossen P. Boeren S. de Wit P.J. Vervoort J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3458-3466Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Briefly, a sample (9 nmol) of peptide was reduced for 5 min with a 25–50-fold excess of tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine in 0.1 m citrate, pH 3.0. Sulfhydryls were derivatized using a 600-fold excess of NEM in 0.1 m citrate, pH 3.0, for 20 min followed by immediate RP-HPLC purification. Fractions corresponding to partially reduced peptide were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and by automated Edman degradation with an ABD Procise 494 Sequencer. Far UV (λ = 195–250 nm) circular dichroism spectra were measured with a JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter using a 0.1-cm-path length quartz cell. Temperature was controlled using a JASCO PFD-425S temperature control unit. CD spectra were analyzed using the k2d neural network program (35Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) to predict the secondary structure content of peptides. Affinity Chromatography—The chosen metalloproteinase was coupled to NHS-Sepharose (GE Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocol. All of the bound enzymes retained activity. A combinatorial peptide library was mixed with immobilized enzyme overnight at 4 °C. Weakly or nonspecifically bound peptides were removed with 3 column volumes of enzyme buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5), and bound peptides were eluted serially in 5 column volumes of 20% isopropanol. Each fraction was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS to identify bound peptides. Matrix Metalloproteinases—Full-length proMMP-1 and a truncated form of proMMP-3 missing the C-terminal hemopexin domain were expressed in Escherichia coli and folded from inclusion bodies as described previously (36Chung L. Shimokawa K. Dinakarpandian D. Grams F. Fields G.B. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29610-29617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). ProMMP-1 was activated using 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate and 0.02 eq of MMP-3 at 37 °C for 6 h. After activation, MMP-3 was separated from MMP-1 by affinity chromatography with a column of anti-MMP-3 IgG Affi-Gel 10. ProMMP-3 was activated by treatment with 5 μg/ml chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. Chymotrypsin was then inactivated with 2 mm diisopropylfluorophosphate. ProMMP-2 was purified from the culture medium of human uterine cervical fibroblasts (37Itoh Y. Binner S. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and activated by incubating with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate for 1 h at 37 °C. The concentrations of active MMPs were determined by active site titration with N-TIMP-1 (38Huang W. Suzuki K. Nagase H. Arumugam S. Van Doren S. Brew K. FEBS Lett. 1996; 384: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). MMP-9 (catalytic domain) was expressed as described elsewhere.4 EBNA-293 cells expressing ADAMTS-4 were a generous gift of Dr. Hideaki Nagase (The Kennedy Institute for Rheumatology, Imperial College, London). The cells were cultured in Opti-MEM-1 medium with 4% fetal bovine serum, 25 units/ml penicillin, 25 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml hygromycin, and 250 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Invitrogen) (39Kashiwagi M. Enghild J.J. Gendron C. Hughes C. Caterson B. Itoh Y. Nagase H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10109-10119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected, and ADAMTS-4 was purified using an anti-FLAG affinity column followed by size exclusion chromatography using an S75 high load 16/60 Sephacryl column (GE Biosciences). Recombinant MT1-MMP and ADAM-17 were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Inhibition Kinetic Studies—Peptide substrates and inhibitors were dissolved in TNC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 0.05% Brij-35, pH 7.5). 1–2 nm enzyme was incubated with varying concentrations of inhibitors for 2 h at room temperature. Residual enzyme activity was monitored by adding 0.1 volume of the appropriate substrate to produce a final concentration of <0.1 Km. Initial velocity rates were determined from the first 20 min of hydrolysis when product release is linear with time. Fluorescence was measured on a Molecular Devices SPECTRAmax Gemini EM Dual-Scanning Microplate Spectrofluorimeter using λexcitation = 324 nm and λemission = 393 nm. Apparent Ki values were calculated using SigmaPlot® by fitting data to the equation v = v0/(1 + I/Ki), here v0 is the activity in the absence of inhibitor, and Ki is the apparent inhibition constant. Because the substrate concentration is less than Km/10, the apparent Ki values are insignificantly different from true Ki values. After 18 h, each enzyme-inhibitor pair was monitored by RP-HPLC to test for hydrolysis of the inhibitor. No inhibitor degradation was observed in any case. NMR Methods—NMR spectra were acquired on a Varian Inova 500 MHz instrument equipped with pulsed-field gradient, 3xRF channels, and waveform generators. The peptides were dissolved at a 2.5 mm concentration in water with 10% D2O (used for locking purposes) and 4 nmol of TSP and placed in 3-mm NMR tubes (Kontes Glass). The pH was adjusted to 3.6 using 0.01 m NaOH and a Thermo micro-pH probe. The spectra were obtained using a 3-mm HCN generation 5 high performance probe. NMR experiments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 0 to 50 °C to achieve the best chemical shift dispersion to aid the sequence-specific assignments. For one-dimensional NMR experiments, the water signal was suppressed using double spin echo (40Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1540) Google Scholar). For two-dimensional experiments, water suppression was carried out using WATER-GATE (41Piotto M. Saudek V. Sklenar V. J. Biomol. NMR. 1992; 2: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (3508) Google Scholar) in combination with 3919 purge pulses with flip-back (42Price W.S. Annu. Rep. NMR Spectroscopy. 1999; 38: 289-354Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), which were implemented in the total correlation spectroscopy and NOE spectrometry pulse sequences. All of the two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in the phasesensitive mode using the States-Haberkorn method (43States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar) with a spectral width of 6000 Hz and 2K data points. All of the NMR data were processed using VNMR 6.1C (Varian NMR Instruments) on a Sun Blade 150 work station. Free induction decays were apodized with a shifted sine bell window function and linearly predicted to 1 K points in t1 and zero-filled to 2000 × 2000 data matrices. The data were base line-corrected in F2 by applying a polynomial function. NOE spectrometry cross-peaks were assigned and classified according to their intensities as strong, medium, or weak with the aid of their volume integrals. Sequence-specific assignments of all proton resonances were carried out using standard biomolecular NMR procedures (44Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986Crossref Google Scholar). A member of the ET family whose solution structure has been determined (6Mills R.G. Atkins A.R. Harvey T. Junius F.K. Smith R. King G.F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 282: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Atkins A. Martin R.C. Smith R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), sarafotoxin 6b (Srt6b) (Fig. 1), was initially tested for MMP inhibitory activity and was found to inhibit MMP-2 and MMP-3 with Ki values of 4 and 8 μm, respectively (data not shown). To decrease the affinity for the endothelin receptors and thus reduce or eliminate other biological activities and toxicity, Srt6b was truncated at Asp18. This peptide, designated STX, lost essentially all of its inhibitory activity toward MMPs but was used as a starting point for developing metalloproteinase inhibitors (for nomenclature and sequences, see Table 1). Initially, positions 4 and 16 were chosen for modification because, based on the Srt/N-TIMP analogy (Figs. 1 and 2), the residues at these sites differ from those in TIMPs, suggesting that appropriate substitutions could impart a more TIMP-like structure and improve the inhibitory activity; also the amino acids at these sites vary within the ET family, suggesting that substitutions would not perturb the folding capacity of these constructs. STX-A4, incorporating Ala (which is found in this site in TIMP-4) and STX-V16, derived from the analogous site in TIMP-1, were generated, folded, purified, and tested for MMP inhibitory activity. Metalloproteinases were selected to represent different subgroups including a collagenase (MMP-1), two gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9), a stromelysin (MMP-3), membrane-type (MT1-MMP), an ADAM (ADAM-17), and an aggrecanase (ADAMTS-4). STX-V16 showed no improvement in inhibitory capacity compared with STX, whereas STX-A4 showed marked improvement toward MMP-1, -2, and -9 (Table 2). None of the peptides significantly inhibited MT1-MMP, ADAM-17, or ADAMTS-4 (data not shown). Based on these results, a variant containing the substitution of Ser for Lys4 (representing residue 4 from TIMP-2 and TIMP-3) was synthesized. This analog, STX-S4, showed further enhancement of activity toward MMP-1, -2, and -9, and was inactive toward MT1-MMP, ADAM-17, and ADAMTS-4 (Table 2 and Fig. 3).TABLE 1Sequences of sarafotoxin analogsNameSequenceSrt6bCys Ser Cys Lys Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys His Gln Asp Val Ile TrpSTXCys Ser Cys Lys Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys His Gln AspSTX-V16Cys Ser Cys Lys Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys Val Gln AspSTX-A4Cys Ser Cys Ala Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys His Gln AspSTX-S4Cys Ser Cys Ser Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys His Gln AspSTX-CTCys Ser Cys Lys Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys Met Ser Glu Met SerSTX-S4-CTCys Ser Cys Ser Asp Met Thr Asp Lys Glu Cys Leu Tyr Phe Cys Met Ser Glu Met Ser Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Apparent Ki values of Srt variants for different MMPs (μm)InhibitorMMP-1MMP-2MMP-3MMP-9MT1-MMPADAM-17ADAMTS-4STXNAaNA, not applicable.NA>100NA>100>100>100STX-V16NANA>100NA>100>100>100STX-A421.5 ± 0.641.8 ± 3.5>10024.5 ± 0.9>100>100>100STX-S422.0 ± 2.235.0 ± 4.4>10029.3 ± 0.0>100>100>100STX-CT>100>100>10025.3 ± 3.5>100>100>100STX-S4-CT4.5 ± 0.021.6 ± 2.2>1001.0 ± 0.1>100>100>100Ac-STX-S4-CT>100NANA66.0 ± 4.0NANANAAbu-STX-S4-CT>100NA>100>100NANANAAcAbu-STX-S4-CTNANANANANANA"
