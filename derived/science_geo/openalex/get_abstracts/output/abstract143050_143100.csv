https://openalex.org/W2164714222,"Endotoxin, a constituent of Gram-negative bacteria, stimulates macrophages to release large quantities of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1), which can precipitate tissue injury and lethal shock (endotoxemia). Antagonists of TNF and IL-1 have shown limited efficacy in clinical trials, possibly because these cytokines are early mediators in pathogenesis. Here a potential late mediator of lethality is identified and characterized in a mouse model. High mobility group–1 (HMG-1) protein was found to be released by cultured macrophages more than 8 hours after stimulation with endotoxin, TNF, or IL-1. Mice showed increased serum levels of HMG-1 from 8 to 32 hours after endotoxin exposure. Delayed administration of antibodies to HMG-1 attenuated endotoxin lethality in mice, and administration of HMG-1 itself was lethal. Septic patients who succumbed to infection had increased serum HMG-1 levels, suggesting that this protein warrants investigation as a therapeutic target."

Immunological synapse formation is now shown to be an active and dynamic mechanism that allows T cells to distinguish potential antigenic ligands. Initially, T cell receptor ligands were engaged in an outermost ring of the nascent synapse. Transport of these complexes into the central cluster was dependent on T cell receptor-ligand interaction kinetics. Finally, formation of a stable central cluster at the heart of the synapse was a determinative event for T cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2071675524,"S100/calgranulin polypeptides are present at sites of inflammation, likely released by inflammatory cells targeted to such loci by a range of environmental cues. We report here that receptor for AGE (RAGE) is a central cell surface receptor for EN-RAGE (e xtracellular n ewly identified RAGE-binding protein) and related members of the S100/calgranulin superfamily. Interaction of EN-RAGEs with cellular RAGE on endothelium, mononuclear phagocytes, and lymphocytes triggers cellular activation, with generation of key proinflammatory mediators. Blockade of EN-RAGE/RAGE quenches delayed-type hypersensitivity and inflammatory colitis in murine models by arresting activation of central signaling pathways and expression of inflammatory gene mediators. These data highlight a novel paradigm in inflammation and identify roles for EN-RAGEs and RAGE in chronic cellular activation and tissue injury."
https://openalex.org/W2022084143,"In the absence of disease, the vasculature of the mammalian eye is quiescent, in part because of the action of angiogenic inhibitors that prevent vessels from invading the cornea and vitreous. Here, an inhibitor responsible for the avascularity of these ocular compartments is identified as pigment epithelium–derived factor (PEDF), a protein previously shown to have neurotrophic activity. The amount of inhibitory PEDF produced by retinal cells was positively correlated with oxygen concentrations, suggesting that its loss plays a permissive role in ischemia-driven retinal neovascularization. These results suggest that PEDF may be of therapeutic use, especially in retinopathies where pathological neovascularization compromises vision and leads to blindness."
https://openalex.org/W2152330468,"The tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of cytokines includes both soluble and membrane-bound proteins that regulate immune responses. A member of the human TNF family, BLyS (B lymphocyte stimulator), was identified that induced B cell proliferation and immunoglobulin secretion. BLyS expression on human monocytes could be up-regulated by interferon-γ. Soluble BLyS functioned as a potent B cell growth factor in costimulation assays. Administration of soluble recombinant BLyS to mice disrupted splenic B and T cell zones and resulted in elevated serum immunoglobulin concentrations. The B cell tropism of BLyS is consistent with its receptor expression on B-lineage cells. The biological profile of BLyS suggests it is involved in monocyte-driven B cell activation."

https://openalex.org/W2076684078,"The control of growth is fundamental to the developing metazoan. Here, we show that CHICO, a Drosophila homolog of vertebrate IRS1–4, plays an essential role in the control of cell size and growth. Animals mutant for chico are less than half the size of wild-type flies, owing to fewer and smaller cells. In mosaic animals, chico homozygous cells grow slower than their heterozygous siblings, show an autonomous reduction in cell size, and form organs of reduced size. Although chico flies are smaller, they show an almost 2-fold increase in lipid levels. The similarities of the growth defects caused by mutations in chico and the insulin receptor gene in Drosophila and by perturbations of the insulin/IGF1 signaling pathway in vertebrates suggest that this pathway plays a conserved role in the regulation of overall growth by controling cell size, cell number, and metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W2065286203,"Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by a high incidence of skin cancers. Yeast RAD30 encodes a DNA polymerase involved in the error-free bypass of ultraviolet (UV) damage. Here it is shown that XP variant (XP-V) cell lines harbor nonsense or frameshift mutations in hRAD30 , the human counterpart of yeast RAD30 . Of the eight mutations identified, seven would result in a severely truncated hRad30 protein. These results indicate that defects in hRAD30 cause XP-V, and they suggest that error-free replication of UV lesions by hRad30 plays an important role in minimizing the incidence of sunlight-induced skin cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2080119716,"The neural events associated with visually guided reaching begin with an image on the retina and end with impulses to the muscles. In between, a reaching plan is formed. This plan could be in the coordinates of the arm, specifying the direction and amplitude of the movement, or it could be in the coordinates of the eye because visual information is initially gathered in this reference frame. In a reach-planning area of the posterior parietal cortex, neural activity was found to be more consistent with an eye-centered than an arm-centered coding of reach targets. Coding of arm movements in an eye-centered reference frame is advantageous because obstacles that affect planning as well as errors in reaching are registered in this reference frame. Also, eye movements are planned in eye coordinates, and the use of similar coordinates for reaching may facilitate hand-eye coordination."
https://openalex.org/W2101671662,"Netrins are bifunctional: they attract some axons and repel others. Netrin receptors of the Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC) family are implicated in attraction and those of the UNC5 family in repulsion, but genetic evidence also suggests involvement of the DCC protein UNC-40 in some cases of repulsion. To test whether these proteins form a receptor complex for repulsion, we studied the attractive responses of Xenopus spinal axons to netrin-1, which are mediated by DCC. We show that attraction is converted to repulsion by expression of UNC5 proteins in these cells, that this repulsion requires DCC function, that the UNC5 cytoplasmic domain is sufficient to effect the conversion, and that repulsion can be initiated by netrin-1 binding to either UNC5 or DCC. The isolated cytoplasmic domains of DCC and UNC5 proteins interact directly, but this interaction is repressed in the context of the full-length proteins. We provide evidence that netrin-1 triggers the formation of a receptor complex of DCC and UNC5 proteins and simultaneously derepresses the interaction between their cytoplasmic domains, thereby converting DCC-mediated attraction to UNC5/DCC-mediated repulsion."
https://openalex.org/W1536781994,"The inability to deliver growth factors locally in a transient but sustained manner is a substantial barrier to tissue regeneration. Systems capable of localized plasmid gene delivery for prolonged times may offer lower toxicity and should be well-suited for growth factor therapeutics. We investigated the potency of plasmid gene delivery from genes physically entrapped in a polymer matrix (gene activated matrix) using bone regeneration as the endpoint in vivo. Implantation of gene activated matrices at sites of bone injury was associated with retention and expression of plasmid DNA for at least 6 weeks, and with the induction of centimeters of normal new bone in a stable, reproducible, dose- and time-dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W2006873092,"Microarray-based gene expression analysis identified genes showing ploidy-dependent expression in isogenic Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains that varied in ploidy from haploid to tetraploid. These genes were induced or repressed in proportion to the number of chromosome sets, regardless of the mating type. Ploidy-dependent repression of some G 1 cyclins can explain the greater cell size associated with higher ploidies, and suggests ploidy-dependent modifications of cell cycle progression. Moreover, ploidy regulation of the FLO11 gene had direct consequences for yeast development."

https://openalex.org/W2118200380,"The interaction of cytoplasmic dynein with its cargoes is thought to be indirectly mediated by dynactin, a complex that binds to the dynein intermediate chain. However, the roles of other dynein subunits in cargo binding have been unknown. Here we demonstrate that dynein translocates rhodopsin-bearing vesicles along microtubules. This interaction occurs directly between the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of rhodopsin and Tctex-1, a dynein light chain. C-terminal rhodopsin mutations responsible for retinitis pigmentosa inhibit this interaction. Our results point to an alternative docking mechanism for cytoplasmic dynein, provide novel insights into the role of motor proteins in the polarized transport of post-Golgi vesicles, and shed light on the molecular basis of retinitis pigmentosa."

https://openalex.org/W2151892983,Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is thought to control the generation of motor neurons and interneurons in the ventral CNS. We show here that a Shh-independent pathway of interneuron generation also operates in the ventral spinal cord. Evidence for this parallel pathway emerged from an analysis of the induction of ventral progenitors that express the Dbx homeodomain proteins and of Evx1/2 (V0) and En1 (V1) neurons. Shh signaling is sufficient to induce Dbx cells and V0 and V1 neurons but is not required for their generation in vitro or in vivo. Retinoids appear to mediate this parallel pathway. These findings reveal an unanticipated Shh-independent signaling pathway that controls progenitor cell identity and interneuron diversity in the ventral spinal cord.
https://openalex.org/W2044495919,"The chromatin accessibility complex (CHRAC) belongs to the class of nucleosome remodeling factors that increase the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA in an ATP-dependent manner. We found that CHRAC induces movements of intact histone octamers to neighboring DNA segments without facilitating their displacement to competing DNA or histone chaperones in trans. CHRAC-induced energy-dependent nucleosome sliding may, in principle, explain nucleosome remodeling, nucleosome positioning, and nucleosome spacing reactions known to be catalyzed by CHRAC. The catalytic core of CHRAC, the ATPase ISWI, also mobilized nucleosomes at the expense of energy. However, the directionality of the CHRAC- and ISWI-induced nucleosome movements differed drastically, indicating that the geometry of the native complex modulates the activity of its catalytic core."
https://openalex.org/W1978569157,"Drosophila NURF is an ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex that contains ISWI, a member of the SWI2/SNF2 family of ATPases. We demonstrate that NURF catalyzes the bidirectional redistribution of mononucleosomes reconstituted on hsp70 promoter DNA. In the presence of NURF, nucleosomes adopt one predominant position from an ensemble of possible locations within minutes. Movements occur in cis, with no transfer to competing DNA. Migrating intermediates trapped by Exo III digestion reveal progressive nucleosome motion in increments of several base pairs. All four core histones are retained quantitatively during this process, indicating that the general integrity of the histone octamer is maintained. We suggest that NURF remodels nucleosomes by transiently decreasing the activation energy for short-range sliding of the histone octamer."
https://openalex.org/W1535836957,"'Naked' nucleic acid vaccines are potentially useful candidates for the treatment of patients with cancer, but their clinical efficacy has yet to be demonstrated. We sought to enhance the immunogenicity of a nucleic acid vaccine by making it 'self-replicating'. We accomplished this by using a gene encoding an RNA replicase polyprotein derived from the Semliki forest virus, in combination with a model antigen. A single intramuscular injection of a self-replicating RNA immunogen elicited antigen-specific antibody and CD8+ T-cell responses at doses as low as 0.1 microg. Pre-immunization with a self-replicating RNA vector protected mice from tumor challenge, and therapeutic immunization prolonged the survival of mice with established tumors. The self-replicating RNA vectors did not mediate the production of substantially more model antigen than a conventional DNA vaccine did in vitro. However, the enhanced efficacy in vivo correlated with a caspase-dependent apoptotic death in transfected cells. This death facilitated the uptake of apoptotic cells by dendritic cells, providing a potential mechanism for enhanced immunogenicity. Naked, non-infectious, self-replicating RNA may be an excellent candidate for the development of new cancer vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W2139663454,"The SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Dock has been proposed to transduce signals from guidance receptors to the actin cytoskeleton in Drosophila photoreceptor (R cell) growth cones. Here, we demonstrate that Drosophila p 21-a ctivated k inase (Pak) is required in a Dock pathway regulating R cell axon guidance and targeting. Dock and Pak colocalize to R cell axons and growth cones, physically interact, and their loss-of-function phenotypes are indistinguishable. Normal patterns of R cell connectivity require Pak’s kinase activity and binding sites for both Dock and Cdc42/Rac. A membrane-tethered form of Pak (Pakmyr) acts as a dominant gain-of-function protein. Retinal expression of Pakmyr rescues the R cell connectivity phenotype in dock mutants. These data establish Pak as a critical regulator of axon guidance and a downstream effector of Dock in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1998125139,"Composites of nanoparticles and conjugated polymers that exhibit composition-tunable optical constants have been developed for use in semiconducting photonic structures. For example, the 550-nanometer wavelength in-plane refractive index of poly(p-phenylenevinylene)–silica composites can be tailored over the range of 1.6 to 2.7, allowing efficient distributed Bragg reflectors and waveguides to be fabricated. Low levels of chemical doping improve electrical conductivity through these structures without detriment to their photonic properties. Exemplifying these concepts, all-polymer microcavities and microcavity light-emitting diodes were demonstrated. Appropriate confinement of photons and electron-hole pairs in these organic semiconductor-based structures can be achieved."

https://openalex.org/W2050185244,"The integral membrane subunits of many voltage-dependent potassium channels are associated with an additional protein known as the beta subunit. One function of beta subunits is to modify K+ channel gating. We have determined the structure of the conserved core of mammalian beta subunits by X-ray crystallography at 2.8 A resolution. Like the integral membrane component of K+ channels, beta subunits form a four-fold symmetric structure. Each subunit is an oxidoreductase enzyme complete with a nicotinamide co-factor in its active site. Several structural features of the enzyme active site, including its location with respect to the four-fold axis, imply that it may interact directly or indirectly with the K+ channel's voltage sensor. This structure suggests a mechanism for coupling membrane electrical excitability directly to chemistry of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W2015025921,"Drug resistance of pathogens is an increasing problem whose underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Cellular uptake of the major drugs against Trypanosoma brucei spp., the causative agents of sleeping sickness, is thought to occur through an unusual, so far unidentified adenosine transporter. Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used in a functional screen to clone a gene ( TbAT1 ) from Trypanosoma brucei brucei that encodes a nucleoside transporter. When expressed in yeast, TbAT1 enabled adenosine uptake and conferred susceptibility to melaminophenyl arsenicals. Drug-resistant trypanosomes harbor a defective TbAT1 variant. The molecular identification of the entry route of trypanocides opens the way to approaches for diagnosis and treatment of drug-resistant sleeping sickness."
https://openalex.org/W1978363477,"Measurements from the Southern Ocean show that particulate organic carbon (POC) concentration is well correlated with the optical backscattering by particles suspended in seawater. This relation, in conjunction with retrieval of the backscattering coefficient from remote-sensing reflectance, provides an algorithm for estimating surface POC from satellite data of ocean color. Satellite imagery from SeaWiFS reveals the seasonal progression of POC, with a zonal band of elevated POC concentrations in December coinciding with the Antarctic Polar Front Zone. At that time, the POC pool within the top 100 meters of the entire Southern Ocean south of 40 degrees S exceeded 0.8 gigatons."
https://openalex.org/W2080199880,Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an important greenhouse gas that is presently increasing at a rate of 0.25 percent per year. Records measured along two ice cores from Summit in Central Greenland provide information about variations in atmospheric N 2 O concentration in the past. The record covering the past millennium reduces the uncertainty regarding the preindustrial concentration. Records covering the last glacial-interglacial transition and a fast climatic change during the last ice age show that the N 2 O concentration changed in parallel with fast temperature variations in the Northern Hemisphere. This provides important information about the response of the environment to global climatic changes.
https://openalex.org/W1976293694,"Frazzled (Fra) is the DCC-like Netrin receptor in Drosophila that mediates attraction; Roundabout (Robo) is a Slit receptor that mediates repulsion. Both ligands are expressed at the midline; both receptors have related structures and are often expressed by the same neurons. To determine if attraction versus repulsion is a modular function encoded in the cytoplasmic domain of these receptors, we created chimeras carrying the ectodomain of one receptor and the cytoplasmic domain of the other and tested their function in transgenic Drosophila. Fra-Robo (Fra’s ectodomain and Robo’s cytoplasmic domain) functions as a repulsive Netrin receptor; neurons expressing Fra-Robo avoid the Netrin-expressing midline and muscles. Robo-Fra (Robo’s ectodomain and Fra’s cytoplasmic domain) is an attractive Slit receptor; neurons and muscle precursors expressing Robo-Fra are attracted to the Slit-expressing midline."
https://openalex.org/W2072982560,"The UV-damaged DNA-binding (UV-DDB) protein is the major factor that binds DNA containing damage caused by UV radiation in mammalian cells. We have investigated the DNA recognition by this protein in vitro, using synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes and the protein purified from a HeLa cell extract. When a32P-labeled 30-mer duplex containing the (6-4) photoproduct at a single site was used as a probe, only a single complex was detected in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. It was demonstrated by Western blotting that both of the subunits (p48 and p127) were present in this complex. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using various duplexes showed that the UV-DDB protein formed a specific, high affinity complex with the duplex containing an abasic site analog, in addition to the (6-4) photoproduct. By circular permutation analyses, these DNA duplexes were found to be bent at angles of 54° and 57° in the complexes with this protein. From the previously reported NMR studies and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer experiments in the present study, it can be concluded that the UV-DDB protein binds DNA that can be bent easily at the above angle.

Among the photolesions, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone photoproducts ((6-4) photoproducts), formed at dipyrimidine sites in DNA, have been studied most intensively (1Taylor J.-S. Pure Appl. Chem. 1995; 67: 183-190Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In eukaryotic cells, damaged DNA is repaired by multiple mechanisms, and the photoproducts described above, especially the (6-4) photoproducts, are repaired by the nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway (3Sancar A.

The mechanism of human NER has been investigated in relation with the inherited syndrome, xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is caused by a defect in NER and is categorized into seven complementation groups, XPA through XPG, and a variant. In the proposed model, the XPA protein, which is absent in XPA patients, forms a complex with replication protein A and recognizes the DNA lesion at the first step of NER (5Matsuda T. Saijo M. Kuraoka I. Kobayashi T. Nakatsu Y. Nagai A. Enjoji T. Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Hanaoka F. Yasui A. Tanaka K. J. Biol.

Other DNA-binding proteins that recognize damaged DNA include replication protein A (8Burns J.L. Guzder S.N. Sung P. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11607-11610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and the UV-damaged DNA-binding (UV-DDB) protein, which is related to XPE (9Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar, 10Hirschfeld S. Levine A.S. Ozato K. Protic M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In terms of DNA recognition by proteins, we have focused on the UV-DDB protein, which is the major factor that binds UV-damaged DNA in human cell extracts. The human UV-DDB activity was originally isolated from placenta, as a protein binding to UV-irradiated DNA (11Feldberg R.S. Grossman L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 2402-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Feldberg R.S. Lucas J.L. Dannenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6394-6401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, the human UV-DDB protein was purified from HeLa cells (13Hwang B.J. Chu G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1657-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 14Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it was found that this protein consisted of two subunits, with molecular masses of 124 and 41 kDa (14Keeney S. Chang G.J. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21293-21300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent sequence determination of the isolated cDNAs revealed that the actual molecular weights were 1.27 × 105 and 4.8 × 104 (15Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F. Admon A. Linn S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The (6-4) photoproduct was regarded as the preferential binding site for the UV-DDB protein (10Hirschfeld S. Levine A.S. Ozato K. Protic M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2041-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 16Treiber D.K. Chen Z. Essigmann J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5805-5810Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A kinetic analysis using DNA duplexes, each containing a photoproduct at a single site, revealed that this protein bound to the (6-4) photoproduct with an association constant of 1.6 × 1010m–1, whereas its affinity for the cis-syn CPD was reported to be equal to or marginally above that for the undamaged thymines (17Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Many studies have aimed toward the elucidation of the biological function of the UV-DDB protein. It was shown that the UV-DDB activity was absent in XPE cells (9Chu G. Chang E. Science. 1988; 242: 564-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar), although further analyses revealed that a defect in this activity was not a general feature of all XPE patients (18Kataoka H. Fujiwara Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 1139-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Keeney S. Wein H. Linn S. Mutat. Res. 1992; 273: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relationship of the UV-DDB protein to NER has been investigated intensively. While it was reported that an injection of the purified UV-DDB protein into XPE cells lacking the UV-DDB activity stimulated DNA repair to normal levels (20Keeney S. Eker A.P.M. Brody T. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Linn S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4053-4056Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), this protein was not essential for the reconstitution of NER with purified proteins (21Aboussekhra A. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K.

Cell. 1995; 80: 859-868Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (750) Google Scholar), and another group described that the in vitro excision activity of cell-free extracts from XPE cells was not restored by the addition of the purified UV-DDB protein (22Kazantsev A. Mu D. Nichols A.F. Zhao X. Linn S. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5014-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It was suggested recently that this protein has a role in the repair of DNA in chromatin (23Otrin V.R. Kuraoka I. Nardo T. McLenigan M. Eker A.P.M. Stefanini M. Levine A.S. Wood R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3182-3190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A more recent model suggests that the UV-DDB protein recognizes the CPD at the initial step of global genomic repair, and then is replaced by the XPC·HR23B complex (24Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Besides its relationship to NER, several proteins with the ability to interact with the UV-DDB protein have been identified (25Hayes S. Shiyanov P. Chen X. Raychaudhuri P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 240-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 26Watanabe T. Sukegawa J. Sukegawa I. Tomita S. Iijima K. Oguchi S. Suzuki T. Nairn A.C. Greengard P. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 549-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The function of each subunit has also been investigated. The 127-kDa subunit was reported to bind the UV-damaged DNA specifically (27Hwang B.J. Liao J.C. Chu G. Mutat. Res. 1996; 362: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that p48, which is mutated in XPE cells (28Nichols A.F. Ong P. Linn S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24317-24320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), activates p127 by a hit-and-run mechanism (29Hwang B.J. Toering S. Francke U. Chu G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4391-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Since the expression of the p48 gene was found to be dependent on the p53 tumor suppressor, it is proposed that this subunit acts as a link between p53 and NER (24Hwang B.J. Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 424-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). We focused our study on the DNA recognition by the UV-DDB protein. To simplify the interpretation of the experimental results, synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes were used in this study, with the protein purified from a HeLa cell extract, and a single complex was obtained in each assay. We report here that a ternary complex between p127, p48, and DNA was detected in our in vitro assays, and propose that a kink or a kinkable nature of the damaged DNA is recognized by this protein. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Perkin Elmer Applied Biosystems model 394 DNA/RNA synthesizer. Phosphoramidites of 3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran (dSpacer), 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-2′-deoxyguanosine,O 6-methyl-2′-deoxyguanosine, and amino modifier C6 dT were purchased from Glen Research, and were used following the manufacturer's instructions. Other reagents for the synthesizer were obtained from Perkin Elmer Japan. Oligonucleotides containing the (6-4) photoproduct and the cis-syn thymine dimer were synthesized as described previously (30Iwai S. Shimizu M. Kamiya H. Ohtsuka E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7642-7643Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 31Murata T. Iwai S. Ohtsuka E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 7279-7286Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The deprotected oligonucleotides were purified by HPLC, using a Waters μBondasphere 15μ C18 300 Å column (7.8 × 300 mm) at a flow rate of 2.0 ml/min, with a linear gradient of acetonitrile in 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate (pH 7.0). For the preparation of the oligonucleotide containing a cisplatin adduct, a 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotide,p-d(CCTCTGGTCTCC), was synthesized using Chemical Phosphorylation Reagent II (Glen Research), and an aliquot (0.10 μmol) was treated with cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (0.12 μmol; Strem Chemicals) in distilled water (2 ml) in the dark for 3 days. After removal of the remaining reagent on a Sephadex G-25 column (1.5 × 24 cm), the product was purified by HPLC using a μBondasphere 5μ C18 300 Å column (3.9 × 150 mm). The cisplatin-modified oligonucleotide (5 nmol) was mixed with d(CTCGTCA) (5 nmol), p-d(TACAGTCAGTG) (5 nmol), and the complementary strand (5 nmol) in water (50 μl), and the solution was heated at 65 °C for 5 min and was cooled gradually to room temperature. This mixture was treated with T4 DNA ligase (1,600 units; New England Biolabs) in a buffer (250 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin at 16 °C for 14 h. The cisplatin strand was separated from the complementary strand by anion-exchange HPLC using a TSK-GEL DEAE-2SW column (4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh Corp.) with a linear gradient of ammonium formate in 20% aqueous acetonitrile at a column temperature of 75 °C. For fluorescent dye labeling, tetramethylrhodamine and 5-carboxyfluoresceinN-hydroxysuccinimide esters (Glen Research and Berry & Associates, respectively) were used. A (6-4) 49-mer, d(AGCTACCATGCCTGCACGAAT(6-4)TAAGCAATTCGTAATCATGGTCATAGCT), and its complementary oligonucleotide with biotin at the 5′-end, biotin-d(TTTTTTTTTTTAGCTATGACCATGATTACGAATTGCTTAATTCGTGCAGGCATGGTAGCT), were synthesized on a 1.0-μmol scale, and purified by reversed-phase HPLC. The (6-4) 49-mer (about 15 nmol) and the biotinylated 60-mer (about 10 nmol) were mixed in water (90 μl), and the solution was heated at 95 °C for 5 min and cooled to room temperature. This solution was diluted with a buffer (410 μl) containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5) and 0.5 m NaCl, and was added to UltraAvidin-agarose (1.8 ml; Leinco Technologies), which was prewashed and suspended in the same buffer, and the suspension was kept on ice. Binding of the biotinylated duplex to the avidin-agarose was monitored by measuring the absorbance of the supernatant on a spectrophotometer. After 90 min, the damaged DNA-containing agarose was collected by centrifugation and packed into an Econo-Column (0.5 × 10 cm; Bio-Rad). This column was equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 0.1 m KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol before sample loading. A HeLa cell extract from a 30-liter culture, prepared as described previously (32Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), was loaded on a column (2.5 × 20 cm) of cellulose phosphate (Whatman P11) equilibrated with an elution buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m KCl. Proteins were eluted by stepwise increases of the KCl concentrations (0.1, 0.45, and 1.0 m) in the above elution buffer. More than 3 column volumes of the eluant were used at each KCl concentration, and protein binding to the (6-4) photoproduct-containing probe was analyzed by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) described below. The fractions at 0.45m KCl, which contained the target protein, were combined and dialyzed against the elution buffer containing 0.1 mKCl. The protein solution was divided into halves at this step. One-half was loaded on a column (0.7 × 10 cm) of double-stranded DNA-cellulose (Sigma) equilibrated with the elution buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, which was eluted in steps (0.3, 1.0, and 2.0m KCl). The fractions at 1.0 m KCl, containing the target protein, were combined, and after dialysis against the elution buffer containing 0.1 m KCl, the solution was loaded on the affinity chromatography column described above. Elution was performed with 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 m KCl in the elution buffer, and the target protein was found in the fractions at 2.0m KCl. The remaining half was purified in the same way. After desalting by dialysis, the purified protein sample was treated with lysyl endopeptidase (0.5 μg; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 37 °C for 15 h in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) containing 4 murea. The resultant peptides were separated by HPLC, using a Bakerbond Octyl column (4.6 × 250 mm; J. T. Baker) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile (0 to 60%) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. After lyophilization, the sequence of each peptide was determined on a Shimadzu PPSQ-10 protein sequencer. The modified strands (20 pmol) were mixed with [γ-32P]ATP (560 kBq, about 3 pmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (6 units; Takara Shuzo) in a buffer (25 μl) containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm DTT, and the mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 80 min. After heating at 70 °C for 10 min, the oligonucleotides were precipitated with ethanol. Double-stranded DNA probes were prepared by mixing aliquots of the 32P-labeled strands with a small excess of each complementary strand, followed by heating the mixtures at 95 °C for 2 min and cooling them to room temperature. The mixtures for binding (10 μl) included 10 nm32P-labeled probe, 0.1 mg/ml poly(dI)·poly(dC), and the purified UV-DDB protein in 13.6 mm Hepes-KOH (pH 7.9), 0.14 mm EDTA, 3.4 mm MgCl2, 0.14 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 mm DTT, and 3% glycerol. After an incubation at 37 °C for 20 min, a dye solution (1 μl) containing xylene cyanol and bromphenol blue in 50% glycerol was added, and the mixtures were loaded onto a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel (acrylamide:N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide = 19:1). The gel size was 15 × 15 cm, and a buffer containing 50 mm Trizma (Tris base), 0.4 m glycine, and 2 mm EDTA was used. Electrophoresis was performed at 20 mA, and the bands were detected on either a BAS-2500 or a BAS-5000 bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Photo Film) and by autoradiography. Antibodies against p127 and p48 were prepared using peptides, LDITPLGDSNGLSPLC (positions 540–555) and KRSRSPLELEPEAKKLC (positions 22–38), respectively. After separation by SDS-PAGE or in the same way as the EMSA, the subunits and the protein-DNA complex were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and probed with each antibody. The duplexes shown in Fig. 5 A were designed using the published structure (33Coppel Y. Berthet N. Coulombeau C. Coulombeau C. Garcia J. Lhomme J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4817-4830Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) and a B-form DNA generated with Insight II version 97.0 (Molecular Simulations) on a Silicon Graphics O2 workstation. These duplexes (0.22 nmol) were dissolved in a buffer (2.2 ml) containing 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), and 0.1 mm EDTA, and their steady-state fluorescence emission spectra, excited at 490 nm, were measured at 10 °C on a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The distance between the two dyes (R) was calculated using the equation,E = 1 − (I DA/I D) = 1/{1 + (R/R 0)6}, whereE is the energy transfer efficiency, andI DA and I D are the emission intensity in the presence and the absence of the acceptor, respectively (34Yang M. Millar D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The critical Förster distance (R 0) was calculated to be 53.3 Å for this duplex (34Yang M. Millar D.P. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 278: 417-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A 277-bp DNA was prepared by ligating 14 oligonucleotides with chain lengths between 30 and 47. Only the 30-mers containing a damaged site were phosphorylated using [γ-32P]ATP. Typically, four 5′-phosphorylated oligonucleotides were mixed in a buffer (400 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and 25 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and treated with T4 DNA ligase (2,000 units) at 16 °C for 16 h. After an aliquot was analyzed by nondenaturing 5% PAGE, two other oligonucleotides and the ligase were added, and the mixture was incubated again. The DNA fragments were purified by nondenaturing PAGE, eluted out of the gel, and precipitated with ethanol. The 277-bp DNA was cleaved with restriction endonucleases, as shown in Fig. 6, and the resultant 157-bp fragments were used for EMSA at a concentration of 25 nm. The bend angle (α) was calculated using the equation, μM/μE = cos(α/2), where μM and μE represent the mobility of the protein-DNA complex with the damage at the middle and at the end of the DNA fragment, respectively (35Thompson J.F. Landy A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 9687-9705Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). In another study, 2Iwai, S., Mizukoshi, T., Fujiwara, Y., Masutani, C., Hanaoka, F., and Hayakawa, Y. (1999) Nucleic Acids Res. 27, 2299–2303. we assayed HeLa cell extracts to find proteins that bind DNA containing the (6-4) photoproduct, using synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes, and when (6-4) 30 (Table I) was used, a single specific complex was detected. The protein forming this complex was purified first in this study. A whole cell extract was prepared as described (32Masutani C. Sugasawa K. Yanagisawa J. Sonoyama T. Ui M. Enomoto T. Takio K. Tanaka K. van der Spek P.J. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Hanaoka F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1831-1843Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), and the first purification was performed by cation-exchange chromatography using a column of cellulose phosphate. The proteins were eluted by stepwise increases of the KCl concentration in the buffer, and the fractions containing the target protein were determined by the EMSA. A band was detected in the fractions at 0.45 m KCl. The second purification was performed on a column of DNA-cellulose. After stepwise elution, the target protein was detected by the EMSA in the fractions at 1.0 m KCl. For further purification, we tried to exploit the high affinity of the target protein for the (6-4) photoproduct, and a synthetic oligonucleotide duplex containing this photoproduct was linked to a matrix for chromatography, using the avidin-biotin interaction. By stepwise elutions of this column with increasing KCl concentrations, the target protein was detected by EMSA in the fractions at 2.0 m KCl. Analysis by SDS-PAGE revealed that the purified sample contained three polypeptides, one of which gave only a weak band (Fig. 1A). The amount of the protein obtained from the HeLa cell extract was quantified as 0.1 mg by the dye-binding method using Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotide duplexes used for electrophoretic mobility shift assaysDesignationX1X2Y1Y2(6-4) 30(6-4) photoproduct of TTAACPD 30Cyclobutane thymine dimerAACisplatin 30aThe sequence was d(CTCGTCACCTCTGGTCTCCTACAGTCAGTG).Cisplatin adduct at GGCCAbasic 30TAbasic site analogAT8-Oxo-G 30T8-Oxo-GACO 6-Me-G 30TO 6-Me-GACT·C-Mismatch 30TTACT·T-Mismatch 30TTATNick 30bThe damaged strand was separated between X1 and X2.

This polypeptide mixture was degraded with lysyl endopeptidase, and the resultant peptides were separated by reversed-phase HPLC. The sequences of 13 peptides of up to 19 amino acids were determined, and it was found that all of them were identical with the partial sequences of two subunits (127 and 48 kDa) of the human UV-DDB protein, which was reported previously (15Dualan R. Brody T. Keeney S. Nichols A.F. Admon A. Linn S. Genomics. 1995; 29: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since no other sequence was obtained, the third polypeptide, with an estimated molecular mass of 85,000 by SDS-PAGE, was regarded as a degradation product from the 127-kDa subunit. This 85-kDa impurity could not be removed by either gel filtration or glycerol gradient centrifugation. Antibodies against p127 and p48 were prepared using peptides derived from each sequence, and as shown in Fig. 1 B, the two subunits were detected specifically with these antibodies. The EMSA was carried out using the purified UV-DDB protein, and a single complex was detected with the (6-4) 30 probe (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). To determine the subunit composition of this complex, a Western blotting analysis was carried out using the antibodies described above, after the separation of the protein-DNA complex on a gel in the same way as the EMSA. It was demonstrated, as shown in Fig.1 C, that the complex obtained in the EMSA contained both subunits of the UV-DDB protein. In order to gain insight into the interactions between the UV-DDB protein and the damaged DNA, the substrate specificity of this protein was determined using various damaged or modified duplexes. As shown in Table I, the probes used in this study included oligonucleotide duplexes containing a cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD 30), acis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) adduct (cisplatin 30), 3-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydrofuran as a stable abasic site analog (abasic 30), 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxo-G 30),O 6-methylguanine (O 6-Me-G 30), a T·C or T·T mismatch (T·C-, T·T-mismatch 30), and a single-strand break (nick 30), as well as (6-4) 30. All of the oligonucleotides were synthesized chemically, except that DNA ligase was used to prepare cisplatin 30. The EMSA was carried out using these probes, and the results are shown in Fig.2. The probes containing the (6-4) photoproduct and the abasic site analog gave a thick retarded band, showing that these duplexes formed a stable complex with the UV-DDB protein. Bands were also found in the lanes with the CPD and cisplatin probes, but they were relatively weak. The other duplexes did not exhibit obvious complex formation with this protein. EMSA experiments, using single-stranded oligonucleotides as probes, confirmed that the complexes were formed only with double-stranded DNA (data not shown). The specificity was tested by competition experiments, as shown in Fig.3. In these EMSA experiments, unlabeled duplexes containing the (6-4) photoproduct, the CPD, and the abasic site analog were used as competitors against each32P-labeled probe, and the concentration-dependent decrease in the radioactivity of the bound probe was compared with those using unmodified 30-bp duplexes. In all cases, competition was observed only for the damage-containing duplexes. These results demonstrate that the complex formation between these duplexes and the UV-DDB protein is specific to the damage in the DNA. Finally, the affinity of the duplex containing the abasic site analog was compared with those of the (6-4) photoproduct- and CPD-containing duplexes, whose K a values were reported previously (17Reardon J.T. Nichols A.F. Keeney S. Smith C.A. Taylor J.-S. Linn S. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21301-21308Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Competition EMSA experiments were carried out against the32P-labeled (6-4) 30 probe, and as shown in Fig.4, the abasic 30-mer duplex competed with (6-4) 30 less and more efficiently than the (6-4) and CPD duplexes, respectively. The results revealed that the affinity for the UV-DDB protein is in the order of (6-4) > abasic > CPD. This order can also be estimated from the thickness of the bands in Fig. 2.Figure 3Specificity of the UV-DDB protein for damaged DNA. Competition experiments were carried out against the32P-labeled (6-4) 30, CPD 30, and abasic 30 (lanes 1–7, 8–14, and 15–21, respectively) using damaged (lanes 2–4, 9–11, and 16–18) and undamaged (lanes 5–7, 12–14, and 19–21) 30-mer duplexes as competitors. The concentration of each 32P-labeled probe was 9 nm, and those of the competitors were 180, 450, and 900 nm (from left to right). After an incubation with the purified UV-DDB protein, the complex was separated from the free probe by nondenaturing 5% PAGE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 4Comparison of the affinities of the UV-DDB protein for the duplexes containing the (6-4) photoproduct, the abasic site analog, and the CPD .

https://openalex.org/W2087210697,The stress orientation signature of weak faults containing high-pressure fluids has been observed for segments of the San Andreas fault system in southern California. The inferred lithostatic fluid pressures extend into the surrounding relatively intact rock in a zone scaling with the width of the interseismic strain accumulation. Repeated strain-related fracturing and crack sealing may have created low-permeability barriers that seal fluids into the network of currently active fractures.

https://openalex.org/W2045258515,"Broad-area, vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers were shown to switch their emission mode from the regular single or multilobed light fields to exhibit complex arrays of “dark beams.” Examination of these dark spot arrays revealed that they consist of multiple, closely packed optical vortices: optical fields that have phase singularities and show increased complexity as the injection current level is raised. Contrary to their complex appearance, most of these light distributions are not the result of a multimode (multiple-frequency) operation but exhibit single-frequency characteristics. The dark beam patterns can be described as emanating from a spontaneous process of transverse mode locking of nearly degenerate modes, assisted by the laser nonlinearity. Surprisingly, these patterns show high resemblance to patterns generated in other nonlinear scenarios that are completely different both in scale and in mechanism."

https://openalex.org/W2021883819,"Reactive oxygen species have been recently identified as important mediators of mitogenic signaling in a number of cell types. We therefore explored their role in mediating mitogenesis of airway smooth muscle. The antioxidants catalase,N-acetylcysteine, and probucol significantly reduced proliferation in primary cultures of rat tracheal smooth muscle stimulated with fetal bovine serum or platelet-derived growth factor, without affecting cell viability or inducing apoptosis.N-Acetylcysteine also significantly reduced serum-stimulated elevation of c-Fos but did not prevent the normal mitogen-induced increase in c-fos mRNA. Fractionation of ribosomes by sucrose density centrifugation and subsequent dot-blot Northern analysis revealed that antioxidants reduced incorporation of c-fos mRNA into the heaviest polyribosomes, suggesting redox regulation of c-fos mRNA translation. Serum treatment of monolayers produced a small but reproducibly significant rise in superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec by myocyte monolayers. Serum-induced ferricytochromec reduction, cellular proliferation, and c-Fos elevation were decreased by the flavoprotein-dependent enzyme inhibitor dipheyleneiodonium. Growth responses to fetal bovine serum and superoxide dismutase-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochromec were not different between cultured tracheal myocytes from wild-type versus gp91 phagocyte oxidase null mice. These results suggest that mitogen stimulation of airway smooth muscle induces signal transduction of cell proliferation that is in part dependent on generation of partially reduced oxygen species, generated by an NADH or NADPH oxidoreductase that is different from the oxidase in phagocytic cells.

Oxidant signaling might be especially important in the asthmatic airway, where smooth muscle proliferation in chronic severe asthma contributes to development of fixed airways obstruction.

One proposed source of these species is a cytochromeb 558- and flavoprotein-dependent membrane NADH or NADPH oxidoreductase similar to that found in phagocytes (2Satriano J.A. Shuldiner M. Hora K.

However, the exact structural nature of this oxidase and its relation to growth factor-stimulated proliferative responses are not completely defined. We therefore investigated whether mitogen-stimulated tracheal myocytes also generate reactive oxygen species that are important for signaling cellular proliferation. Male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Charles River (Raleigh, NC). Transgenic mice lacking the gene for the gp91 component of phagocyte oxidase (gp91phox) were a gift from Dr. Mary Dinauer (Indiana University, Indianapolis, IN) (16Pollock J.D. Williams D.A.

Protease inhibitors and guanidine thiocyanate were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Diphenyleneiodonium chloride was from Aldrich. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM),1 Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS), HEPES, antibiotic-antimycotic (10,000 units of penicillin, 10,000 μg of streptomycin, and 25 μg of amphotericin B/ml) and trypsin-EDTA solution were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from HyClone (Logan, UT). Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Antibodies for c-Fos (antibody-2, rabbit polyclonal antibody) and A431 cell lysate standard were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Antibodies to Fos-B (102-G, goat polyclonal) and peroxidase-labeled anti-goat IgG were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Peroxidase-labeled sheep polyclonal anti-mouse and donkey polyclonal anti-rabbit IgG were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. M-MLV reverse transcriptase was from Promega (Madison, WI). Catalase (bovine liver), cytochrome c(horse heart), N-acetylcysteine, probucol, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (bovine erythrocyte), horseradish peroxidase (type II), antibody for α-smooth muscle actin and all other materials were purchased from Sigma, unless specified. Rat or mouse tracheal smooth muscle was cultured as previously reported (17Fryer A. Huang Y.-C. Rao G. Jacoby D. Mancilla E. Whorton R. Piantadosi C.A. Kennedy T. Hoidal J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1997; 282: 208-219PubMed Google Scholar, 18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and wild-type or gp91phox null mice were euthanized, and the posterior tracheal membrane was digested twice for 30 min at 37 °C in HBSS containing 0.2% type IV collagenase and 0.05% type IV elastase. Enzyme digests were centrifuged at 500 × g, and the pellet was resuspended and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, nonessential amino acids, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and amphotericin (250 ng/ml) in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2/95% air at 37 °C. Upon reaching confluence, cells were passed with 0.25% trypsin-0.002% EDTA. Immunostaining was performed using a polyclonal antibody against α-smooth muscle actin (Sigma) and visualized using an avidin-biotin-immunoperoxidase technique. Smooth muscle cultures demonstrated the typical “hill and valley” appearance under phase-contrast microscopy and stained avidly for α-smooth muscle actin. Preliminary studies demonstrated that culture of cells in the presence of 10% FBS resulted in a linear growth phase up to 120 h. Cultures from passages 2–9 were used for experiments. Proliferation of cultured airway smooth muscle was quantitated using a previously reported colorimetric method based upon metabolic reduction of the soluble yellow tetrazolium dye 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) to its insoluble purple formazan by the action of mitochondrial succinyl dehydrogenase (18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). This assay empirically distinguishes between dead and living cells. For proliferation studies, cells were seeded into 24-well uncoated plastic plates (Costar) at 15,000–50,000 cells per well and cultured with DMEM and mitogens. After 24–96 h, medium was removed, cells were washed twice with 1 ml of sterile Dulbecco's modified phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) without Ca2+ or Mg2+, the medium was replaced with 1 ml/well fresh DMEM containing 100 μg/ml MTT and 0.5% FBS, and plates were incubated for an additional 1 h. MTT-containing medium was removed, 0.5 ml of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was added to each well, and the absorbance of the solubilized purple formazan dye was measured at 540 nm. A total of 4–6 wells was studied under each treatment condition. Preliminary studies were performed with 50–200 μg/ml MTT incubated for 15 min to 3 h to determine the optimum concentration and incubation time at which the rate of conversion was linear and proportional to the number of cells present. The absorbance of the MTT formazan reduction product (A 540) correlated with cell numbers counted by hemocytometer with anR 2 = 0.99. In some experiments, the MTT assay and responses to mitogens and inhibitors were also confirmed by performing cell counts on 10 random fields/well of Giemsa-modified Wright's stained monolayers viewed at a magnification of × 40 using a 0.01-cm2 ocular grid. Cell proliferation was studied in cultures stimulated with 0.5–10% FBS or 0–75 ng/ml PDGF-AB. To explore the role of oxidants in signaling mitogenesis, we tested the effects on cell proliferation of supplementing media with the O⨪2 scavenger superoxide dismutase (SOD) (300–3000 units/ml) the H2O2 scavenger catalase (300–3000 units/ml), the sulfhydryl donor and hydroxyl radical (·OH) scavengerN-acetylcysteine (NAC) (10 mm), the antioxidant lipid lowering agent probucol (10−6 to 10−3m) (19Parthasarathy S. Young S.G. Witztum J.L. Pittman R.C. Steinberg D. J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 77: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol (1 mm), the nitric oxide synthase inhibitorNω-nitro-l-arginine (100 μm), and the NADH/NADPH oxidoreductase flavoprotein inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) (5–25 μm) (20Bhunia A.K. Han H. Snowden A. Chatterjee S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15642-15649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To study the effect of antioxidants or DPI on early response genes important for cellular proliferation, confluent rat tracheal myocytes in 6-well plates were growth-arrested for 24 h in serum-free DMEM and stimulated with 10% FBS and DMEM, in the presence or absence of 3000 units/ml catalase or 20 mm NAC at the time of stimulation. In some experiments, growth-arrested monolayers were also preincubated with catalase or NAC 2 h prior to stimulation. After 30, 60, or 90 min, cells were lysed and c-fos mRNA was measured by RT-PCR, Northern blotting, and ribonuclease protection assay, as described below. To study whether levels of c-Fos or Fos-B were affected, confluent rat myocyte monolayers on 6-well plates were growth-arrested for 48 h in 0.5% FBS and DMEM. Cells were then pretreated with catalase (3000 units/ml) or NAC (20 mm) for 2 h or DPI (25 μm) for 30 min and stimulated with 10% FBS and DMEM for 15, 30, or 60 min, in the presence of additional scavengers or DPI added at the time of stimulation. Cells were then lysed, and c-Fos and Fos-B were assayed by immunoblotting as described below. To determine whether antioxidants influenced the rate of c-Fos elimination, confluent rat myocytes grown in 25-cm2 Petri dishes were growth-arrested for 24 h in 0.5% FBS and DMEM and stimulated with 10% FBS and DMEM. After 60 min, stimulated cells were treated with 20 mm NAC or DPBS vehicle, and cycloheximide (25 μg/ml) was added to media to block further message translation. Cells were then harvested 1,2,4 and 6 h later for immunoblot assay of c-Fos. Finally, to study potential regulation of c-Fos production at the ribosomal level, rat tracheal myocytes were grown to confluence in T-80 flasks, growth-arrested in DMEM for 72 h, preincubated with 3000 units/ml catalase or 20 mm NAC for 2 h, and stimulated for 30 min with 10% FBS in the presence or absence of antioxidants. Cells were then harvested, polysomes were fractionated by sucrose gradient centrifugation, and purified mRNA from each fraction was subjected to dot-blot Northern assay for c-fosas described below. O⨪2 generation by FBS stimulated airway smooth muscle cells was measured by the technique of SOD-inhibitable reduction of ferricytochrome c (21Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 121-122Google Scholar), employing a modification allowing absorbance reading with an automatic enzyme immunoassay reader (22Pick E. Mizel D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1981; 46: 211-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Confluent cells grown on 24-well plates were growth-arrested for 72 h in serum-free DMEM, washed with DPBS, and incubated at 37 °C with 160 μm ferricytochrome c in total volume of 400 μl of HBSS (phenol red-free) with and without 10% FBS or copper-zinc SOD (300 units/ml). The absorbance of each well, blanked to replicate wells incubated with ferricytochromec and SOD without FBS, was measured at 550 nm initially and again after 60 min of serum stimulation using an ELx800UV automated microplate reader (Biotek Instruments, Highland Park, VT). Monolayers were then washed with DPBS, and cell protein was measured using the BCA protein assay (Pierce). O⨪2 generation, normalized to cell protein, was computed from the Beer-Lambert relationship (23Bashford C.L. Harris D.A. Bashford C.L. Spectrophotometry & Spectrofluorimetry. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 1-22Google Scholar) as the quotient of SOD-inhibitable increase absorbance over time divided by the difference between the molar extinction coefficients for ferricytochrome c and ferrocytochrome c(ΔEM = 2.1 × 104m−1cm−1) (21Fridovich I. Greenwald R.A. Handbook of Methods for Oxygen Radical Research. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1985: 121-122Google Scholar) and a measured light path length of 1 mm. In some experiments, DPI (10 μm) was added to medium 30 min before and again at the time of serum stimulation to determine the magnitude of ferricytochrome c reduction that might be attributable to flavoprotein containing NADH or NADPH oxidoreductases. To assess for cytotoxicity, DPI (5–50 μm), catalase (3000 units/ml) or NAC (20 mm) was added to wells of airway smooth muscle cells grown to confluence on 24 well plates and growth-arrested for 24 h in 0.5% FBS and DMEM. After 24 h, lactate dehydrogenase activity in microcentrifuged supernatant was measured using a commercially available assay (DG-1340K from Sigma). Cell death was assessed by trypan blue dye exclusion. To confirm that antioxidants were suppressing growth mechanisms rather than inducing apoptosis, cells grown to confluence on 35-mm Petri dishes or on glass slides were treated with 3000 units/ml catalase or 20 mm NAC for 24 h. Apoptosis was studied by visually assessing endonuclease dependent DNA fragmentation on ethidium bromide-stained agarose gels, as previously reported (18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent cultures treated with drug for 24 h were washed twice with DPBS, scraped on ice into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 250 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in 30 μl of DPBS and lysed by addition of 30 μl of lysis buffer (80 mm EDTA, 1.6% (w/v) sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 5 mg/ml proteinase K in 200 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0). Lysate was incubated at 50 °C for 24 h. RNase (0.2 mg/ml) was added, and the lysate was incubated for another 2 h at 37 °C. DNA was extracted by the phenol-chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar), and bands were separated along with a DNA ladder standard on a 1% agarose gel at 60 V for 1 h, intercalated with eithidium bromide, and visualized and photographed under UV light. Apoptosis was also studied by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-dependent 3′-OH fluorescein end-labeling of DNA fragments, using a Fluorescein-FragELTM DNA fragmentation detection kit (Oncogene Research Products, Cambridge, MA). Treatment of cells with 100 μm pyrrolidinedithiocarbamate was used as a positive control (25Tsai J.-C. Jain M. Hsieh C.-M. Lee W.-S. Yoshizumi M. Patterson C. Perrella M.A. Cooke C. Wang H. Haber E. Schlegel R. Lee M.-E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3667-3670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Fos gene family products were quantitated as described previously (18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were placed on ice, washed twice with cold DPBS, scraped into 0.5 ml of boiling buffer (10% (v/v) glycerol and 2% (w/v) SDS in 83 mm Tris, pH 6.8) and sheared by four passages through a pipette. Aliquots were removed for protein determination, as described previously. After 10% β-mercaptoethanol and 0.05% bromphenol blue were added, lysates were boiled for 5 min and stored at −80 °C until immunoblotting was performed. Proteins in defrosted samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gels (15 μg of protein/lane) and electrotransferred to 0.45 μm Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the wet transblot method in transfer buffer (0.025 m Tris, 0.192m glycine, 2.6 mm SDS, and 20% (v/v) methanol; pH 8.8) at 100 volts for 1 h. Blots were blocked overnight at 4 °C with blocking buffer (PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% fat-free milk powder (Carnation, Glendale, CA). After rinsing five times for 5 min each in PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 2.0 μg/ml of c-Fos polyclonal antibody. After rinsing again as above, blots were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase antibody diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer as the secondary antibody for c-Fos. Immunoblots were rinsed again as above and detected via an enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL Western blotting detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Autoradiographic film (X-OMAT AR, Eastman Kodak) was exposed to immunoblots for 10, 30, or 60 s to obtain satisfactory images that were quantitated by laser densitometry using Kodak 1D image analysis software (Kodak). Fos B was assayed similarly using polyclonal goat anti-Fos B primary and anti-goat IgG/horseradish peroxidase secondary antibodies. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was performed by modification of procedures previously described (18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kennedy T.P. Ghio A.J. Reed W. Samet J. Zagorski J. Quay J. Carter J. Dailey L. Hoidal J.R. Devlin R.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 366-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Cell monolayers were washed twice with DPBS and lysed with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm sodium citrate, and 0.5% Sarkosyl. After scraping, lysates were sheared with four passes through a pipette. RNA was extracted using the phenol-chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63147) Google Scholar) and quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260 and 280 nm. RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed using 200 units of M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) in a reaction mixture containing 1 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP; 40 units of RNase inhibitor; 25 μm random hexamers; 5 mm MgCl2; 500 mm KCl; and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), in a total volume of 20 μl. The reaction was performed at 42 °C for 60 min followed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 95 °C. The resultant cDNA was PCR amplified for 30 and 35 cycles for GAPDH and c-fos, respectively, using rat gene-specific sense and antisense primers (18Dashtaki R. Whorton A.R. Murphy T.M. Chitano P. Reed W. Kennedy T.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1998; 285: 876-883PubMed Google Scholar) based on sequences published in GenBankTM: GAPDH, 5′ ACCACCATGGAGAAGGCTGG 3′ and 5′ CTCAGTGTAGCCCAGGATGC 3′ (528 bp product); c-fos, 5′ ACTGGATAGAGCCGGCGGAG 3′ and 5′ GGCTGGTGGAGATGGCTGTC 3′ (331 bp product), respectively. The specificity of primers for rat c-fos was confirmed by Southern blotting performed using a sequence internal to the chosen primers. PCR was carried out on a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermal cycler 480. Amplification for GAPDH was carried out by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR conditions for c-fos were 35 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 56 °C for 2 min, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by an extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. PCR-amplified DNA was separated on 1.6% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized and photographed under ultraviolet light. The resulting Polaroid negative was quantitated by laser densitometry. The intensity of the GAPDH cDNA bands (a housekeeping gene unaffected by stimulation with FBS) for each sample was then used to normalize for loading differences in c-fos band intensities. GAPDH and c-fos antisense probes were generated from rat pTRI-GAPDH and mouse p-TRI-c-fos/exon 4 linearized plasmids (Ambion, Austin, TX) using T7 RNA polymerase, producing fragments of 383 and 299 bases, respectively. The probe generated for c-fos had >95% homology with the sequence for rat c-fos. Probes were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 32P-UTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a final concentration of 12.5 μm, purified on SELECT-D(RF) Spin Chromatography columns (5 Prime → 3 Prime, Inc., Boulder, CO) and quantitated on a Beckman LS 60001C scintillation counter. Northern blots were performed with a kit from Ambion according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNA (15 μg) was electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and transferred overnight to a nylon membrane. After UV cross-linkage, membranes were prehybridized at 65 °C for 2 h and hybridized at 65 °C for 14 h with 106 cpm/ml of32P-labeled c-fos cRNA. Membranes were washed twice for 5 min at room temperature with low stringency wash solution (Ambion), washed twice for 15 min at 65 °C with high stringency solution (Ambion), and exposed overnight to Kodak XAR-5 film in an image intensifying cassette at −80 °C. Bands were quantitated by laser densitometry. Equivalent loading of total RNA was verified by stripping c-fos probe from the membrane by boiling in 0.1% SDS in diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water and hybridizing with 106 cpm/ml of 32P-labeled cRNA probe for GAPDH generated similarly from rat pTRI-GAPDH (Ambion). Ribonuclease protection assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions using a kit from Ambion. Briefly, RNA (15 μg) was hybridized at 50 °C for 16 h with 6 × 104 cpm/tube GAPDH and 3 × 105 cpm/tube c-fos antisense probes. The unprotected RNA was digested at 37 °C for 30 min with RNase T1 in RNase digestion buffer. The reaction was stopped by addition of 300 μl of RNase inactivation/precipitation mixture. RNA samples were resuspended in 15 μl of formaldehyde loading buffer, heat denatured for 4 min at 95 °C and electrophoresed on 5% acrylamide/8 m urea denaturing gels. Gels were transferred to filter paper, imaged by autoradiography as described above, and quantitated by laser densitometry. Cells were trypsinized, harvested by centrifugation, and washed twice with ice-cold DPBS containing 50 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cells were then lysed by incubation for 10 min in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (0.25m sucrose, 250 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 0.2 mg/ml heparin (as a ribonuclease inhibitor) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The lysate was then microcentrifuged for 10 min at 4 °C and 14,000 rpm. Linear 15–50% (w/v) sucrose gradients (12.5 ml) were prepared by a two-chamber gradient maker (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and pumped into centrifuge tubes (Beckman Ultra-Clear 14 × 80 mm). The non-sucrose component of the gradient solution was the same as the lysis buffer, except that the concentration of KCl and heparin were 500 mm and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively. Aliquots (800 μl) of microcentrifuged supernatant, representing material from approximately 4 × 106 cells, were layered onto the gradient and centrifuged at 40,000 rpm for 110 min at 4 °C in a Beckman Ultracentrifuge using a 40Ti rotor. The bottom of the tube was punctured by a needle and tubing connected to a peristaltic pump, and gradient fractions of 600 μl were collected into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes containing 3 μl of 20% (w/v) SDS and 50 μl of 4 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0. RNA in each fraction was extracted by the phenol chloroform method (24Chomczynski P. Sa"

Vance D.E. Phosphatidylcholine Metabolism. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 1-8Google Scholar). In the CDP-choline pathway, choline is activated to choline phosphate and subsequently to CDP-choline, which condenses with diacylglycerol (DAG) to obtain PC. In the methylation pathway, however, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) isN-methylated three times withS-adenosylmethionine as the methyl donor in order to yield PC. It was generally thought that PC biosynthesis in prokaryotes occurs, if at all, solely via the methylation pathway (2Rock C.O. Jackowski S. Cronan Jr J.E. Vance D.E. Vance J.E.

Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we describe that S. meliloti possesses a second pathway for PC biosynthesis and with the help of a novel enzyme activity, phosphatidylcholine synthase, S. meliloti can condense choline directly with CDP-diacylglyceride to form PC in one step. We also demonstrate that abundant choline is provided by host plants and can be used for PC biosynthesis by the guest bacterium S. meliloti. S. (Rhizobium) meliloti 1021 (wild type) and derived mutants KDR309 (pmt-deficient) (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), KDR500 (betCBA-deficient), and KDR508 (pmt- andbetCBA-deficient) were grown at 29 °C in tryptone/yeast extract (TY) medium (7Beringer J.E. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1974; 84: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (1617) Google Scholar) or in MOPS minimal medium containing 40 mm MOPS, 20 mm KOH, 20 mmNH4Cl, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mmMgSO4, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 0.3 mg biotin/l, 15 mm succinate, 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7. Antibiotics were added when required to obtain the following final concentrations in mg/liter medium: 400 spectinomycin, 20 piperacillin, 40 gentamycin, and 2 tetracycline forS. meliloti, and 200 spectinomycin, 10 gentamycin, and 20 tetracycline for Escherichia coli. A plasmid (pHY109), which harbors an insertion of the spectinomycin resistance-conferring Ω interposon in the EcoRI restriction sites of the tetracycline-resistant IncP plasmid pCHO341, thereby replacing the betCBA genes (8Østerås M. Boncompagni E. Vincent N. Poggi M.C. Le Rudulier D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11394-11399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), was conjugated inS. meliloti 1021 wild type and the pmt-deficient mutant KDR309 by triparental mating, respectively. The Ω insertion was recombined into the wild type and mutant genomes by the plasmid-incompatibility technique as described (8Østerås M. Boncompagni E. Vincent N. Poggi M.C. Le Rudulier D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11394-11399Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). ThebetCBA-deficient phenotype of tetracycline-sensitive double recombinants was confirmed by their ability to use glycine betaine but not choline as sole carbon source. RecombinantbetCBA-deficient strains derived from S. meliloti1021 wild type and pmt-deficient mutant KDR309 were named KDR500 and KDR508, respectively. The lipid compositions of S. meliloti strains were determined following labeling with [1-14C]acetate for 16 h as described previously (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The strains were labeled in MOPS minimal medium cultures (1 ml) inoculated from fresh overnight cultures. TY components (2.5% tryptone, 1.5% yeast extract; w/v), choline (1 mm), or root exudate of Medicago sativa after 7 days incubation (75 μl of root exudate containing 14.7 μm choline to 1 ml of minimal medium) were added as sterile filtrates to the final concentrations indicated. The in vivo incorporation of choline into PC of S. melilotiwas determined following labeling with [methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). At a cell density of 2 × 108/ml in MOPS minimal medium, [methyl-14C]choline was added to a final concentration of 100 μm. Lipids were analyzed by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography (TLC) as described previously (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The in vitro incorporation of radiolabeled choline into PC was determined in cell-free extracts of thebetCBA- and pmt-deficient double mutant S. meliloti KDR508. The strain was inoculated in 400 ml of MOPS minimal medium from a fresh overnight culture and grown. At a cell density of 4 × 108/ml, cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell-free extracts were prepared as described previously (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. The initial reaction mixture to detect phosphatidylcholine synthase activity contained, in a total volume of 50 μl in Eppendorf tubes, 125 μg of protein, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, and 100 μm[methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol). Final concentrations of additional compounds when applied were 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 343 μm CDP-DAG, 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 340 μm PC, 340 μm DAG, 20 mm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, 5 mm CTP. Cell-free extracts ofE. coli overexpressing the yeast enzymes choline kinase (9Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (10Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J.-I. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2134-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared in a similar way as the Sinorhizobium extracts and 45 μg protein of the choline kinase-containing extract or 63 μg of protein of the choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase-containing extract were added in the cases indicated. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h in a 30 °C water bath. Samples of 10 μl were taken at different time points to confirm the linear character of choline incorporation. Lipids were analyzed by one-dimensional TLC as described previously (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incorporation of radiolabel into PC was determined by scraping the TLC material and by quantifying it with lipophilic scintillation fluid. After performing kinetic studies with the sinorhizobial phosphatidylcholine synthase, it was realized that in the initial reaction mixture substrate inhibition by choline as well as by CDP-DAG occurred. Substrate inhibition can be observed at concentrations higher than 100 μm choline or higher than 75 μmCDP-DAG (data not shown). Therefore conditions for an optimized standard assay were established where no substrate inhibitions occur in order to allow quantification of phosphatidylcholine synthase activity. The optimized standard assay contained in a total volume of 50 μl in Eppendorf tubes was 50 μg of protein, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm MnCl2, 20 μm CDP-DAG, 0.2% (w/v) Triton X-100, and usually 50 μm[methyl-14C]choline (55 mCi/mmol). The mixtures were incubated for 15 min in a 30 °C water bath and stopped by mixing with 188 μl of methanol/chloroform (2:1; v/v). Addition of 63 μl chloroform and 63 μl water led to phase separation, and after washing the chloroform phase once with another 100 μl of water, it was dried and quantified in a scintillation counter. Under such conditions the only radioactive compound detectable in the chloroform phase was PC. The linearity of the enzyme reaction during the incubation period was ensured. [32P]CDP-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol was prepared using a two-step enzymatic conversion. First, diacylglycerol kinase was used to prepare 32P-labeled phosphatidic acid from 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerol and [γ-32P]ATP as described (11Nachiappan V. Rajasekharan R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 283-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Then,32P-labeled phosphatidic acid was converted to CDP-diacylglycerol that was labeled in its phosphatidate residue using CTP and the CDP-diglyceride synthase reaction (12Zhao M. Rua D. Hajra A.K. Greenberg M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Before incorporation studies, [32P]CDP-diacylglycerol preparations were purified by TLC with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (32:4:5:1; v/v) as a running solvent, and the radioactive compound with a R F value between 0.05 and 0.16 was extracted from the silica gel and had a specific radioactivity of 6.4 × 103 cpm/nmol. Similarly, CDP-diacylglycerol that was labeled in its cytidine residue was prepared using [5-3H]CTP and the CDP-diglyceride synthase reaction (12Zhao M. Rua D. Hajra A.K. Greenberg M.L. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 258: 48-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). [5-3H]CDP-diacylglycerol preparations were purified by TLC on silica gel usingn-butyl alcohol/acetone/acetic acid/5% ammonia/water (9:3:2:2:4; v/v) as a running solvent, and the radioactive compound with a R F value between 0.44 and 0.47 was extracted from the silica gel and had a specific radioactivity of 8.9 × 103 cpm/nmol. For the determination of CMP formed by sinorhizobial extracts, the watery phase of Bligh/Dyer extracts was separated in the same TLC system as [5-3H]CDP-diacylglycerol. Whereas CDP essentially did not migrate under such conditions (R F = 0.01–0.06), CMP chromatographed with an R F value between 0.12 and 0.17. Seeds ofMedicago officinalis, M. sativa, and Melilotus alba were surface-sterilized and germinated as described previously (13van Brussel A.A.N. Zaat S.A.J. Canter Cremers H.J.C. Wijffelman C.A. Pees E. Tak T. Lugtenberg B.J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). For the production of root exudates, 20 seedlings of the respective plant were grown in 10 ml of Jensen medium (14Vincent J.M. IBP Handb. 1970; 15: 75-76Google Scholar) as described previously (13van Brussel A.A.N. Zaat S.A.J. Canter Cremers H.J.C. Wijffelman C.A. Pees E. Tak T. Lugtenberg B.J.J. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 165: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Small aliquots of exudates were taken at different time points and choline was determined quantitatively after conversion to choline phosphate using [γ-32P]ATP and choline kinase (15McCaman R.E. Bergmeyer H.U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. VIII. VHC Publishers, Weinheim, Germany1985: 462-473Google Scholar). For the determination of lipid compositions, S. meliloti strains were grown on complex medium or on a MOPS minimal medium in the presence of radiolabeled acetate, and lipid extracts were subsequently separated by TLC. When a S. meliloti mutant (KDR309) with a defective methylation pathway of PC biosynthesis (6de Rudder K.E.E. Thomas-Oates J.E. Geiger O. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6921-6928Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is grown on complex medium containing tryptone and yeast extract, the mutant still forms PC in wild type amounts (Fig.1, lane 2). The methylated intermediates of the methylation pathway, monomethylphosphatidylethanolamine (MMPE) and dimethylphosphatidylethanolamine (DMPE), are not formed in the mutant, and these results suggest the existence of a second, methylation-independent pathway for PC biosynthesis in S. meliloti. Cultivation of S. meliloti in defined minimal medium demonstrates that a similar lipid spectrum is formed by the wild type strain (Fig. 1, lane 3) as found after growth on complex medium (Fig. 1, lane 1), and besides the nonresolved lipids phosphatidylglycerol (PG), cardiolipin (CL), and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), the methylated lipids MMPE, DMPE, and PC are formed. The pmt-deficient mutant KDR309, however, forms neither MMPE, nor DMPE, nor PC under such growth conditions (Fig. 1,lane 4). Therefore one or several components of the complex medium must be required for the second pathway of PC biosynthesis inS. meliloti. The mutant strain was cultivated in defined minimal medium with different additional components in order to identify the substance(s) required for PC biosynthesis (data not shown). Only when choline was added to the minimal medium the Pmt-deficient mutant formed PC (Fig. 1, lane 5) in amounts depending on the choline concentration of the growth medium. When choline concentrations in the minimal medium exceeded 1 μm, the Pmt-deficient mutant formed PC in wild type amounts (data not shown). Choline is taken up efficiently by S. meliloti (16Pocard J.-A. Bernard T. Smith L.T. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and can be utilized as sole carbon and nitrogen source (17Smith L.T. Pocard J.-A. Bernard T. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3142-3149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The proposed pathway of choline degradation (17Smith L.T. Pocard J.-A. Bernard T. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 3142-3149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is initiated by two subsequent oxidation steps catalyzed by choline dehydrogenase (BetB) and glycine betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BetA) leading to the formation of glycine betaine, which can be metabolized further (16Pocard J.-A. Bernard T. Smith L.T. Le Rudulier D. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 531-537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During growth at high osmolarity glycine betaine accumulates in S. meliloti and functions, like in other organisms, as an osmoprotectant or compatible solute. In order to eliminate the possibility that choline degradation was required for choline incorporation in PC, we constructed strains that were unable to degrade choline. The S. meliloti double mutant KDR508, deficient in Pmt and choline oxidation (data not shown), was still able to synthesize PC when choline was added to the minimal growth medium (Fig.1, lane 6), eliminating the possibility that choline degradation was required for choline-dependent PC formation. In order to search for intermediates of the choline-dependent pathway of PC biosynthesis, we labeled S. meliloti strains with radioactive choline and analyzed aliquots of the cell suspensions after various time points. Specifically, we searched for intermediates of the CDP-choline pathway (choline phosphate and CDP-choline), but we were unable to detect either compound in aqueous phases of Bligh/Dyer (18Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42382) Google Scholar) extracts (data not shown). Rather we observed a rapid incorporation of radiolabeled choline into the lipid-containing chloroform phases of Bligh/Dyer extracts and nearly exclusively in PC, similarly as found by Sherr and Law (19Sherr S.I. Law J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 7711-7714Google Scholar) for the close relative Agrobacterium tumefaciens. In a S. meliloti strain unable to oxidize choline (KDR500), the time course of choline incorporation into PC (Fig. 2) is rapid (within minutes), nearly linear, and no delay in incorporation is observed, suggesting that the incorporation might not proceed via any biosynthetic intermediate but might occur in one step. Incorporation of choline into PC of the double mutant KDR508, which cannot oxidize choline and which is unable to form PC via the methylation pathway, occurs twice as fast as in KDR500 (Fig. 2), suggesting that the choline-dependent pathway of PC biosynthesis is working more actively in KDR508 and can compensate for the lack of PC biosynthesis by the methylation pathway. Enzyme activities of the CDP-choline pathway of PC biosynthesis (choline kinase, choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase) could not be detected in cell-free extracts of S. meliloti KDR508 (data not shown). Even when we tried to stimulate such a potential pathway by adding cell-free extracts from E. coli that contained overexpressed choline kinase (9Hosaka K. Kodaki T. Yamashita S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2053-2059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase (10Tsukagoshi Y. Nikawa J.-I. Hosaka K. Yamashita S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2134-2136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from yeast, the incorporation of radioactive choline into PC was not stimulated (Table I), although radiolabeled choline phosphate and CDP-choline were produced in large amounts in the reaction mixture (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the CDP-choline pathway was presumably not the second, choline-dependent pathway for PC biosynthesis in S. meliloti.Table IPhosphatidylcholine synthase activity in S. meliloti extractsAdded compoundCholine incorporationpmol/min mg proteinMg2+<0.01ATP, Mg2+, CKI<0.01CTP, Mg2+, CCT<0.01ATP, CTP, Mg2+, CKI, CCT<0.01DAG, Mg2+<0.01PC, Mg2+<0.01CDP-DAG, Mg2+4.76CDP-DAG, Mg2+, Triton X-10010.65CDP-DAG, Mg2+, Triton X-100, EDTA<0.01CDP-DAG, Mn2+, Triton X-100294.00Effect of added substances on incorporation of radiolabeled choline into phosphatidylcholine by cell-free extracts of S. meliloti KDR508.

The initial reaction mixture contained protein, choline, Tris/HCl buffer, pH 8, and various additional compounds in amounts indicated under “Experimental Procedures.” Abbreviations: CKI, choline kinase; CCT, cholinephosphate cytidylyltransferase. Other pathways for PC biosynthesis involving acylation of lyso-PC or base exchange are known for plants or animals (20Lands W.E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 2233-2237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Kanfer J.N. Can. J. Biochem. 1980; 58: 1370-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) but not in bacteria. Several potential substrates, involved in the reactions of these pathways, were also tested for in vitro activation of choline incorporation into PC by cell-free extracts of S. meliloti. Neither DAG nor PC had any stimulating effect (Table I). However, addition of CDP-DAG showed a strong stimulating effect, especially when the detergent Triton X-100 was present in concentrations (0.1%; w/v) where micelles are formed. The incorporation of radioactive choline into PC was inhibited by addition of the metal ion chelator EDTA, indicating a requirement for bivalent cations (Table I). Of the different bivalent cations tested (data not shown), Mn2+ showed the strongest stimulation of radioactive choline incorporation into phosphatidylcholine by cell-free extracts of S. meliloti (Table I). In order to demonstrate that CDP-DAG is the second substrate of this novel enzymatic reaction, the incorporation of the phosphatidyl moiety of32P-labeled CDP-DAG into PC was studied (TableII). Without addition of choline no incorporation of phosphatidate into PC is observed. Phosphatidate incorporation into PC is strictly dependent on choline, and during PC formation equimolar amounts of choline and phosphatidate are incorporated into PC. A relatively high incorporation of phosphatidate into PE (181 pmol) can be observed without any amino alcohol added. Surprisingly, addition of choline reduced the amount of phosphatidate incorporation into PE. The reduced incorporation (124 pmol) at high CDP-DAG concentrations (50 μm) demonstrates that this effect is not due to a lack of substrates but must result from an inhibition of PE formation by the choline added. The mechanism of this down-regulation of PE formation by choline and therefore of the precursor of the methylation pathway of PC biosynthesis is presently under investigation.Table IIIncorporation of CDP-DAG-derived phosphatidate into PE or PC and of choline into PC by sinorhizobial cell-free extractSubstratesIncorporation into PE, phosphatidateIncorporation into PCRatioCholineCDP-DAGPhosphatidateCholineμmpmolpmol020181002020126981040.945020971881861.0110020652342351.0050104678890.8850501242502481.01Incorporation of phosphatidate or of choline were determined using32P-labeled CDP-diacylglycerol that was labeled in its phosphatidate residue or 14C-labeled choline as substrates. Substrate concentrations were varied and otherwise conditions of the standard assay were used. Open table in a new tab Incorporation of phosphatidate or of choline were determined using32P-labeled CDP-diacylglycerol that was labeled in its phosphatidate residue or 14C-labeled choline as substrates. Substrate concentrations were varied and otherwise conditions of the standard assay were used. In order to show that CMP is the second product of this novel enzymatic reaction, the release of CMP from CDP-DAG that was labeled in its cytidine residue was studied (Table III). Sinorhizobial extracts caused a surprisingly large release (359 pmol) of CMP from CDP-DAG without any amino alcohol added. This release must have been due to phosphatidylserine synthase (Pss) during PE formation and other, uncharacterized CMP-releasing activities. Addition of choline or CDP-DAG increased the amount of CMP released by sinorhizobial extracts. However, the increased amounts of CMP released are significantly less than what is expected if CMP would be released at an equimolar rate as choline or CDP-DAG is incorporated. As we demonstrated above (Table II), however, other CMP-releasing activities,i.e. the Pss-dependent CMP release during the formation of PE, are much reduced when choline is added to the conversion assay, and therefore an increased release of CMP by the Pcs reaction is partially down-compensated by a reduced release of CMP by the Pss reaction. Therefore a stoichiometric release of CMP during the Pcs reaction cannot be shown in cell-free extracts of S. meliloti.Table IIICholine-dependent release of CMP from CDP-DAG in sinorhizobial cell-free extractsSubstratesExtract from S. melilotiCMP release from CDP-DAGCholineCDP-DAGμmpmol020+3592020+3965020+41210020+4245010+2825050+6235020−72Release of CMP was determined using [5-3H]CDP-diacylglycerol as one of the substrates. Substrate concentrations were varied, and otherwise conditions of the standard assay were used. Open table in a new tab Release of CMP was determined using [5-3H]CDP-diacylglycerol as one of the substrates. Substrate concentrations were varied, and otherwise conditions of the standard assay were used. Pcs activity was measured at pH 6.1–7.2 using BisTris/HCl buffer and at pH 7.3–8.8 using Tris/HCl buffer (Fig.3 A). The optimal pH for Pcs in sinorhizobial cell-free extracts was 8.0, and activity decreased as pH was raised or lowered. As shown above the Pcs activity is strictly dependent on the presence of bivalent cations (Table I). Pcs activity was measured as a function of the divalent cations magnesium and manganese (Fig. 3 B). The activity increased with higher magnesium concentrations. Stimulation of the Pcs activity by manganese, however, was much more efficient (more than 20-fold higher) than by magnesium, and 10 mm Mn2+ was found to be optimal for Pcs activity. The mild, nonionic detergent Triton X-100 stimulated Pcs activity in the initial assay (Table I). The effect of the Triton X-100 concentration on the standard Pcs assay was studied (Fig. 3 C), demonstrating that under these conditions there was a strong Triton X-100 dependence of the Pcs activity with a maximal activity at 3.2 mm (0.2%; w/v) Triton X-100. At higher concentrations, Triton X-100 quickly became inhibitory, indicating that substrate dilution kinetics was followed (22Eaton B.R. Dennis E.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 176: 604-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). For analysis of Pcs kinetics with respect to CDP-DAG, a mixed micelle system with Triton X-100 was used (Fig. 4). Pcs activity was measured as a function of the surface concentration of CDP-DAG in the micelle. The bulk CDP-DAG concentration was held constant at 20 μm. The molar ratio of CDP-DAG in the micelle was varied by changing the concentration of Triton X-100. When the molar ratio of CDP-DAG was varied at fixed concentrations of choline, the kinetic curves resembled typical saturation kinetics at lower concentrations of choline (<50 μm). At higher concentrations of choline (>100 μm) the kinetic curves were sigmoidal, which could be indicative of a positive cooperative effect of CDP-DAG or more likely of substrate inhibition by high concentrations of choline.Figure 4Substrate dependence of Pcs activity.Pcs activity in cell-free extracts of S. meliloti was measured as a function of the mol % CDP-DAG in the micelles at fixed concentrations of choline (20 μm (●), 50 μm (○), 100 μm (▾), 150 μm (▿). The bulk concentration of CDP-DAG was maintained at 20 μm; the concentration of Triton X-100 was varied to adjust the molar concentration of CDP-DAG. Otherwise, conditions of the standard assay were used, and activity was measured by following the incorporation of [14C]choline into chloroform-soluble product as described in the text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The phosphatidyltransferases phosphatidylserine synthase (EC 2.7.8.8) (23Kanfer J.

Microbiol. 1983; 29: 1452-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) are involved in the biosynthesis of bacterial membrane phospholipids (25DeChavigny A. Heacock P.N. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

In these reactions the cytidine 5′-monophosphate part of CDP-DAG is replaced by an alcohol like serine or glycerol phosphate. Surprisingly, a phosphatidyltransferase introducing choline as the alcohol was unknown to date, and this “missing link” of phospholipid biochemistry is described here for the first time. In analogy to the known bacterial phosphatidyltransferases, we named this novel enzymatic activity phosphatidylcholine synthase (Pcs). Fig.5 shows the postulated biosynthetic pathways for PC inS. meliloti. The novel Pcs activity enables S. meliloti to produce PC from exogenously provided choline, thereby avoiding the energy-demanding,S-adenosyl-l-methionine-consuming methylation steps of PE during the methylation pathway of PC biosynthesis. However, the potential source of such exogenous choline was unclear. Although free choline and choline derivates are present in plant saps (27Maizel J.V. Benson A.A. Tolbert N.E. Plant Physiol. (Bethesda). 1956; 31: 407-408Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cells due to the action of specific phospholipases on plant lipids (28Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Crossref Scopus (1053) Google Scholar), there were no indications to which extent such plant-derived choline might be available for S. meliloti. Therefore we studied whether roots of host plants of S. meliloti were able to exude choline into their rhizosphere. All three host plants tested (M. officinalis, M. sativa, and M. alba) exuded 0.5–1 nmol of choline/day/plant, leading to choline concentrations in the test medium of about 6 μm after 4 days and reaching maximal concentrations (15–30 μm) after 7–18 days. When root exudates were added to Pmt-deficientS. meliloti mutants grown in minimal medium without choline, they enabled the mutants to produce PC in wild-type amounts (Fig. 1,lanes 7 and 8). These results suggest that legume host plants exude choline to their rhizosphere where it can be used by the guest bacterium S. meliloti as a building block by Pcs to produce PC for the rhizobial membrane. A surprisingly large number of bacteria, involved in symbiotic or pathogenic interactions with plant or animal hosts, contain PC in their membranes (i.e. Brucella (29Thiele O.W. Busse D. Hoffmann K.

The spatial arrangement of the two Ku subunits in the initial Ku-DNA complex, when the Ku protein first approaches the broken DNA end, is not well defined. We have investigated the geometry of the complex using a novel set of photocross-linking probes that force Ku protein to be constrained in position and orientation, relative to a single free DNA end. Results suggest that this complex is roughly symmetric and that both Ku subunits make contact with an approximately equal area of the DNA. The complex has a strongly preferred orientation, with Ku70-DNA backbone contacts located proximal and Ku80-DNA backbone contacts located distal to the free end. Ku70 also contacts functional groups in the major groove proximal to the free end. Ku80 apparently does not make major groove contacts. Results are consistent with a model where the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits contact the major and minor grooves of DNA, respectively.

DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit 70-kDa subunit of Ku 83-kDa subunit of Ku polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis nucleotide 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid Ku protein has a general role in the metabolism of DNA ends in eukaryotic cells, including the repair of double-strand DNA breaks (reviewed in Refs. 1Kanaar R.

Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Ku binds tightly to broken ends and initiates a repair pathway. Biochemical studies in higher eukaryotes, as well as genetic analysis in yeast, have helped to identify many participants in this pathway. In mammalian cells, these include a protein kinase (DNA-PKcs),1 a ligase (DNA ligase IV), a nuclease (hMRE11), and various protein cofactors (XRCC4, hRAD50, p95/NBS1) (reviewed in Ref. 1Kanaar R. Hoeijmakers J.H. van Gent D.C. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 483-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). One of the functions of Ku protein is to recruit the 470-kDa DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) to DNA (3Dvir A. Peterson S.R. Knuth M.W. Lu H. Dynan W.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11920-11924Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar, 4Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). However, in a number of instances, Ku has been shown to have independent functions in repair that do not require DNA-PKcs. These include the alignment of DNA ends in noncovalent complexes visible in the atomic force microscope and the stimulation of eukaryotic DNA ligases (5Pang D. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. Jung M. Dritschilo A. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1412-1415PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ramsden D.A. Gellert M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Studies with mutant cell lines further support the idea that there are functions of Ku that are independent of DNA-PKcs. For example, cells lacking Ku are hypersensitive to the action of the double-strand DNA break-inducing topoisomerase II inhibitor, etoposide, whereas cells lacking DNA-PKcs are not (7Jin S. Inoue S. Weaver D.T. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 965-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cells lacking Ku are unable to perform either V(D)J coding or signal joint formation (8Smider V. Rathmell W.K. Lieber M.R. Chu G. Science. 1994; 266: 288-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 9Taccioli G.E. Gottlieb T.M. Blunt T. Priestley A. Demengeot J. Mizuta R. Lehmann A.R.

Finally, Ku homologues have been identified in a variety of fungal and metazoan organisms, including yeast, roundworms, insects, and vertebrates. By contrast, DNA-PK activity has so far been detected only in one branch of the higher eukaryotic evolutionary tree (the Coelomata), and, among these, the DNA-PKcs gene or polypeptide has been identified unequivocally only in the taxon that includes echinoderms and vertebrates (the Deuterostoma) (reviewed in Ref. 13Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). It thus appears that DNA-PKcs appeared later in evolution than Ku itself. Because of the central and evolutionarily ancient role of Ku protein in double-strand DNA break repair, it is important to understand the mechanism by which it recognizes DNA ends. Human Ku is a heterodimer of 70- and 83-kDa subunits, neither of which contains known DNA binding motifs. In vitro binding studies show that the interaction of Ku with DNA is determined primarily by features of the nucleic acid structure (13Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Ku binds blunt, overhanging, and hairpin ends (14Mimori T. Hardin J.A. Steitz J.A. J. Biol.

End-bound Ku can translocate inward, forming a sliding clamp (17Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to DNA ends, Ku is capable of binding artificial DNA structures containing single- to double-strand transitions (15Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Blier P.R. Griffith A.J. Craft J. Hardin J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7594-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There are also certain sequences that appear to function as entry sites for Ku in double-stranded DNA (19Torrance H. Giffin W. Rodda D.J. Pope L. Hache R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20810-20819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown different requirements for the Ku70 and Ku80 subunits in DNA end binding, depending on the assay used. Ku70 binds DNA in the absence of Ku80 in immunoprecipitation and Southwestern blot analysis (20Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the basis of these results, it has been suggested that the major part of the Ku DNA binding domain may reside in the Ku70 subunit. However, DNA binding activity requires sequences in the C-terminal half of both Ku subunits in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (23Wu X. Lieber M.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5186-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, sequence analysis reveals that Ku70 and Ku80 share weak homology, most evident in lower eukaryotes, over a large C-terminal region encompassing the DNA binding domains defined in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (13Dynan W.S. Yoo S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1551-1559Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). This suggests that the subunits derive from duplication of a common ancestral gene and are likely to share a similar tertiary folding pattern. Consistent with this, recent studies have shown that the sequences required for dimerization map to precisely homologous positions in each subunit of Ku (21Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 842-848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 22Wang J. Dong X. Reeves W.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27259-27265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The existence of sequence homology in Ku70 and Ku80 suggests, but does not prove, that both subunits may have equivalent roles in contacting DNA. We have performed site-specific cross-linking experiments to distinguish between the different models for the role of the two Ku subunits. These experiments define the spatial arrangement of the Ku subunits in the Ku-DNA repair complexes assembled on defined oligonucleotides. Some cross-linking studies with Ku have been performed before (4Gottlieb T.M. Jackson S.P. Cell. 1993; 72: 131-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 17Zhang W.W. Yaneva M.

In particular, a report by Zhang and Yaneva (17Zhang W.W. Yaneva M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 574-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) indicated the relative positions of Ku70 and Ku80 subunit at the DNA end, based on the pattern of protection of probes that were radiolabeled by different methods. However, this early study relied on nonspecific UV cross-linking chemistry and did not involve the introduction of defined cross-linking groups at specific positions in the DNA. In the present work, we have synthesized a novel set of probes that force Ku to be trapped in a unique position and orientation relative to a single free DNA end. Incorporation of aryl azide groups at a number of different backbone positions allows unambiguous determination of the proximity of Ku70 and Ku80 to different points on the DNA surface. The results of these studies show that Ku protein binds DNA as a roughly symmetric, oriented heterodimer, with each subunit making approximately equal numbers of backbone contacts with DNA. Ku70 makes contacts functional groups in the major groove of DNA, while Ku80 apparently does not. To express non-histidine-tagged Ku70, a DNA fragment encoding histidine-tagged Ku70 was excised from pBC-70tH6 (27Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with BamHI and subcloned into pGEM3zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI). The open reading frame, without the histidine tag, was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using as primers: 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′ (a T7 primer) and 5′-GCCGCCGCGGATCCTCAGTCCTGGAAGTGCTTGGT-3′. The amplified fragment was digested with BamHI and subcloned into pVL1393 (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Baculovirus expressing non-histidine-tagged Ku (VBB2–70Ku) was generated by co-transfection of Sf9 cells with this plasmid and linearized baculovirus DNA (BaculoGold, PharMingen). Native Ku was purified from HeLa cell nuclear extracts as described previously, except that the phenyl-Superose and Mono S steps were omitted (28Dvir A. Stein L.Y. Calore B.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10440-10447Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To produce recombinant Ku protein, Sf9 cells (1 liter, 1 × 106 cells/ml) were co-infected with VBB2–86Ku (27Ono M. Tucker P.W. Capra J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3918-3924Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and either VBB2–70tH6 or VBB2–70Ku with a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. After 72 h, cells were harvested and suspended in 30 ml of CB buffer (50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 20% glycerol, 10% sucrose, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 1 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) containing 0.1 m KCl. The suspension was sonicated, incubated with 50 μg/ml DNase I (Sigma) for 30 min on ice, adjusted to 0.42 m KCl, and centrifuged for 1 h at 150,000 × g. To purify Ku without a histidine tag, extracts were pooled from three batches (1 liter each) of infected Sf9 cells. After treatment with DNase I and centrifugation, (NH4)2SO4 was added to the supernatant (0.33 g/ml), and the mixture was stirred at 4 °C for 30 min. The pellet was collected by centrifugation at 150,000 ×g, resuspended in 5 ml of TM buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.9, 12.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.02% Tween 20, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 m KCl), and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a HR 26/60 Superdex 200 column and eluted in Buffer CB with 0.35 mKCl. Fractions containing Ku were diluted to 0.2 m KCl and applied to a 5-ml single strand DNA-agarose column (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ku was eluted with a gradient of 0.2 m-1.0m KCl in Buffer CB. Ku-containing fractions were diluted to 0.1 m KCl, applied to a 5-ml heparin-agarose column pre-equilibrated in Buffer CB, and eluted with KCl steps of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 1 m in buffer CB. Recombinant Ku prepared by this method is functional in kinase and mobility shift assays (data not shown). Ku with a histidine tag was purified essentially as described previously (29Huang J. Nueda A. Yoo S. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26009-26016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). To prepare singly biotinylated 14-mer probes without cross-linking groups, a nonbiotinylated top strand and a bottom strand with a 5′ biotin group were synthesized with the sequence shown in Fig.1. The DNAs were annealed, gel-purified, and radiolabeled using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To prepare doubly biotinylated 14-mer probe, a bottom strand was synthesized that had a 5′ biotin group and lacked the final 3′ nucleotide. This was annealed to a 5′ biotinylated top strand. The DNA was gel-purified and radiolabeled using [α-32P]dGTP and reverse transcriptase. Binding reactions were initiated by incubating DNA (7–15 nm) and streptavidin (1 μm) (Sigma) at room temperature for 30 min in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 5 mmMgCl2. Ku (20 nm) was added and allowed to incubate for 30 min. Aliquots were analyzed by 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 190 mm glycine, and 1 mm EDTA. To prepare top strand DNA probes (Fig. 1 A, probes 1–13), oligonucleotides with a single phosphorothioate modification were synthesized and annealed to unmodified, complementary, bottom strand DNA containing a biotin group at the 5′ end. Duplex DNAs were gel purified and dissolved in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 100 mm NaCl. Probes were radiolabeled at the 5′ end of the top strand using [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. To prepare bottom strand DNA probes (Fig. 1 A, probes 1′–11′), oligonucleotides were synthesized that lacked the final 3′ nucleotide, that had a single phosphorothioate modification, and that contained a biotin group at the 5′ end. These were annealed to unmodified complementary top strand DNA, gel-purified, and radiolabeled by reaction with [α-32P]dGTP and reverse transcriptase. Radiolabeled DNAs were incubated for 3 h in the dark at room temperature in a reaction containing 150 nm DNA, 40 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 60% MeOH, and 12 mm4-azidophenacyl bromide (Sigma). Unreacted reagents were removed using Sephadex G-25 spin columns (5 Prime→3 Prime Inc., Boulder, CO). Protein-DNA complexes were formed in Eppendorf polyethylene microcentrifuge tubes that were placed inside a disposable polystyrene cell culture plate. The plates were then irradiated with 302 nm ultraviolet light (AlphaImager 2000, Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA) for 25 s. Reactions were terminated by addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromphenol blue) and heated for 3 min at 100 °C. Products were resolved by 7% SDS-PAGE and detected by PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) analysis. Oligonucleotides containing double substitutions of 5-iodo-2′-deoxyuridine or 5-iodo-2′deoxycytidine (Fig. 1 B) were synthesized (Cybersyn, Lenni, PA). The oligonucleotides were annealed to bottom strand DNA containing a 5′ biotin group (Fig. 1 B). Duplex DNAs were isolated, radiolabeled, and purified as described above. Cross-linking was carried out in Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes for 30 min using a 325-nm helium-cadmium laser (Omnichrome, Chino, CA). When a double-strand DNA break occurs in vivo, each chromosomal fragment has one broken end. These newly created ends provide an entry site for Ku and other repair proteins. The repair complex generated has an inherent orientation, with some components proximal and others distal to the free DNA end. We sought to develop photocross-linkable oligonucleotide probes that would mimic the in vivosituation. Ordinarily, repair complexes can assemble at either of the two ends of a short oligonucleotide, creating ambiguity when mapping protein-DNA contacts. Our experiments, however, used double-stranded DNA probes with a biotin derivative attached via a phosphodiester linkage at the 5′ end of one strand. In the presence of streptavidin, one DNA end is blocked, forcing the other end to become the sole locus of repair complex assembly. Although it is likely that Ku protein makes its initial contacts with the DNA ends, it is known to translocate along the DNA in an ATP-independent manner. In order to trap the Ku at a unique position corresponding to the initial recognition complex, it was necessary to identify the minimal probe length required for Ku binding. To this end, a series of oligonucleotides (8–36 nt in length) was tested for formation of a stable ternary complex with streptavidin and Ku. A 14-mer was the shortest oligonucleotide able to form a stable complex, shown in Fig. 2 A. This ternary complex was readily distinguishable from streptavidin-DNA and Ku-DNA binary complexes (Fig. 2 A, lanes 2–4). To demonstrate the efficacy of streptavidin in blocking the DNA ends, a 14-mer oligonucleotide with biotin at both ends was also tested. In the absence of streptavidin, this DNA formed a complex with Ku, as expected (Fig. 2 B, lane 3). In the presence of streptavidin, Ku did not bind to this probe (compare lanes 2and 4), demonstrating that streptavidin did indeed block both ends. Taken together, these data suggest that the singly biotinylated 14-mer probe can be used to map the spatial arrangement of Ku70 and Ku80 in an oriented complex formed when the Ku protein initially recognizes the broken DNA end. A set of 14-mer probes was synthesized, each with a single aryl azide group at a different position. Our strategy was to derivatize every second backbone position on either strand of the DNA. Since each aryl azide is capable of reacting with proteins within a 9 Å radius (30Kimzey A.L. Dynan W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13768-13775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), this strategy assured saturation coverage of the DNA surface. Probes were radiolabeled, allowed to bind to Ku, and irradiated with ultraviolet light. Cross-linked products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 3 shows a representative cross-linking experiment using a probe attached near the center of the 14-mer, which allows contact with both Ku subunits. Two well resolved, UV-dependent, radiolabeled bands were seen (Fig.3 A, lanes 2 and 3), corresponding to possible Ku70 and Ku80 adducts. Since Ku70 and Ku80 are fairly similar in size, it was important to determine whether the bands indeed represented cross-linking to the two subunits, rather than cross-linking to the same subunit at different sites to give products of distinct mobility. To distinguish these alternatives, the experiment included one reaction containing a Ku70 subunit with a histidine tag and associated linker sequence. This caused a mobility shift of the lower cross-linked band, relative to nontagged recombinant Ku and native human Ku (Fig. 3 A, lanes 1–3). This shift is comparable with that seen with Coomassie-stained preparations of these proteins (Fig. 3 B) and identifies the lower band as a Ku70 adduct. The upper adduct band has the same mobility in all reactions (Fig. 3 A) and is therefore a Ku80 adduct. For subsequent cross-linking experiments, nontagged recombinant Ku protein was used. We then tested the full set of 14-mer probes. After labeling the probes, we performed a preliminary electrophoretic mobility shift assay, which showed that none of the aryl azide modifications significantly interfered with Ku-DNA binding under the conditions used (data not shown). Cross-linked complexes were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In the absence of streptavidin (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes labeled “−”), we expected to find a mixed population of complexes assembled in both possible orientations on the DNA. Consistent with this, under these conditions, the majority of the probes cross-linked to Ku70 and Ku80 in approximately equal proportions (probes 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 3′, 5′). Other probes showed either a modest or significant preference for Ku70 over Ku80 (probes 1, 5, 1′, 7′, 9′, 11′). When streptavidin was present to block one end of the DNA (Fig. 4,A and B, lanes labeled “+”), there was a marked change in the pattern of Ku-DNA cross-linking. Under these conditions, there were five probes that cross-linked predominantly, and in some cases almost exclusively, to Ku80: 11, 13, 1′, 3′, and 5′. The locations of these five probes are marked by squares in the summary diagram in Fig. 4 C. They are all within the distal half of the DNA, relative to the free end, and define a region of Ku80 contact. There were two probes, 7 and 9, that did not cross-link to either subunit of Ku in the presence of streptavidin. These define a region of noncontact near the center of the oligonucleotide on the top strand. There were six probes that cross-linked predominantly (but not exclusively) to Ku70 in the presence of streptavidin: 1, 3, 5, 7′, 9′, and 11′. The locations of these probes are marked by circlesin Fig. 4 C. They lie within the proximal half of the DNA, relative to the free end, and define a region that is contacted primarily by Ku70 and, to a lesser extent, by Ku80. Taken together, these results show that Ku bound in a defined orientation relative to the free DNA end and that strong contacts with Ku70 and Ku80 are roughly symmetric about an axis perpendicular to the DNA helical axis (dashed vertical line, Fig. 4 C). Quantitation of the cross-linking results provides further insight (Fig. 5, A and B). In these graphs, relative cross-linking to different positions on the top strand is indicated by bars extending above the horizontal axis, and cross-linking to equivalent positions on the bottom strand is indicated by bars extending below the axis.A shows cross-linking of Ku70. There is a cluster of cross-linked sites proximal to the free end. Interestingly, the sites of maximum cross-linking are not directly opposite each other on the top and bottom strands, but are rather offset by about three nt in the 5′ direction on each strand (probe 3 on the top versusprobes 7′ and 9′ on the bottom). In B-form DNA, the phosphates that most closely approach each other on opposite sides of the major groove are displaced by 2–3 nt in the 5′ direction on each strand. Thus, a 5′-staggered pattern of phosphate contacts is strongly indicative of a protein binding site that spans the major groove (31Gartenberg M.R. Ampe C. Steitz T.A. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6034-6038Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). There are two clusters of Ku80 cross-linking apparent in Fig.5 B. One cluster, in the distal half of the fragment relative to the free end, consists of those probes that cross-link only to Ku80 (probes 11, 13, 3′, 5′). Within this distal cluster, the sites of maximum cross-linking on the two strands are offset by about 3 nt in the 3′ direction. Because the phosphates that most closely approach each other across the minor groove of B-form DNA are displaced by 2–3 nt to the 3′ side on each strand, a 3′-staggered pattern of contacts is strongly suggestive of a binding site that spans the minor groove. A second cluster of Ku80 cross-linking is located in the proximal half of the fragment (probes 3, 5, 9′). Cross-linking is about 50% weaker than in the distal cluster, and all of these probes also cross-link to Ku70 more strongly than to Ku80. There are several possible interpretations of the Ku80 cross-linking seen with these probes. One is that the 9 Å cross-linker spacer arms are long enough to permit some reactivity with Ku80 bound in the distal site; another is that Ku80 sequences are partially interdigitated with Ku70 in the folded heterodimer. Ku-DNA contacts were further investigated using 5-iodopyrimidine-substituted DNA probes. Iodopyrimidines cross-link with amino acid residues that are in close contact with the C5 position of cytidine or thymidine in the major groove of DNA (32Meisenheimer K.M. Koch T.H. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 101-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because Ku is a sequence-nonspecific DNA-binding protein, we expect that adventitious contacts with particular bases will differ depending on the exact sequence that is present in the probe. Our strategy, therefore, was to synthesize probes where several nearby pyrimidines were modified simultaneously. This increases the chances that a structural element of Ku that penetrates the major groove will make at least one contact with a cross-linkable group. Cross-linking was performed in the presence and absence of streptavidin, and results are shown in Fig.6 A. In the absence of streptavidin (lanes labeled −), Ku70 cross-linked to probes with substitutions near the ends of the DNA (I-1/5 and I-11/14), but not to a probe with substitutions in the middle (I-7/8). In the presence of streptavidin to orient the complexes (lanes labeled +), Ku70 cross-linked only to a probe substituted at positions near the free end (probe I-1/5), and not to the other two. These results are consistent with the aryl azide data and confirm that Ku70 makes contacts with the major groove at one or more sites within the proximal half of the fragment, relative to the free end. Ku80 did not cross-link to any of the three iodopyrimidine-substituted probes that were tested. This is consistent with the suggestion that Ku80 binds a site that spans the minor groove, rather than the major groove. Although the interaction of Ku protein with nucleic acids has been extensively studied, the essential details of Ku-DNA contacts remain unknown. One of the difficulties is that, because Ku can bind to either end of a conventional DNA probe, there is a potential ambiguity in the orientation of the resulting Ku-DNA complexes. Ku is also known to translocate along the DNA, potentially blurring the pattern of contacts. In the present study, we have adapted a cross-linking method that has been widely used to study sequence-specific DNA binding. This technique is particularly suited to defining the geometry of multisubunit complexes. In this method, aryl azide cross-linking groups are incorporated at specific DNA sites. We designed and synthesized a set of novel aryl azide-containing probes in which one end of the DNA is blocked, forcing the Ku protein to bind to the other end of DNA, in a specific orientation. Moreover, we have used the smallest oligonucleotide that supports formation of a stable Ku-DNA complex, preventing the Ku from sliding along the DNA and also assuring that a high proportion of the contacts are likely to be essential. This approach has allowed us to generate a comprehensive map of the Ku-DNA contacts, showing the proximity of each subunit to different points on the DNA surface. A three-dimensional representation of the DNA probe used in this study, modeled as B-form DNA, is shown in Fig. 7, A andB. The sites of attachment of the aryl azide groups that cross-link predominantly to Ku70 and Ku80 are shown in black and light gray, respectively. The C5 position of iodopyrimidines that cross-link to Ku70 are shown indark gray. To help visualize the location of the Ku-DNA contacts, the sites of maximum cross-linking are marked by the heavy ellipses, and the corresponding probe numbers are indicated in boldface. It appears that the sites of maximum Ku70 contact are in a pocket in the major groove defined by probes 3, 7′, and 9.' The I-5 probe also lies within this pocket. Since the aryl azide probes have a 9-Å spacer arm, a Ku70 secondary structural element bound within the major groove pocket would still be partially reactive with probes at nearby sites, including 1, 5, and 11′. As noted earlier, both the 5′ stagger of the backbone contacts and the reactivity with iodopyrimidines are consistent with a major groove binding model for Ku70. The sites of maximum Ku80 contact appear to correspond to a region of the minor groove defined by probes 11, 13, 3′, and 5′ (in the view shown in Fig. 7 A, this region wraps partly around the DNA molecule to the left). Ku80 bound in this region would be partially reactive with probe 1′, consistent with the observed pattern of cross-linking. Although minor groove-specific cross-linking probes are not available, both the 3′ stagger of the backbone contacts and the absence of iodopyrimidine reactivity are consistent with minor groove localization for Ku80. It is interesting that Ku-DNA contacts are located primarily on one face of the helix. This is apparent from inspection of Fig.7 B, where the DNA model has been rotated 90° relative to the view in Fig. 7 A. The Ku70 binding pocket now faces to the left, and the Ku80 binding surface faces to theleft and behind. In this view, there are few, if any, strong contacts on the right side of the molecule. Probes 7 and 9 show almost no cross-linking above background. Cross-linking to probes 1′, and 11′ is also weak. The arrangement of Ku protein on one face of the helix potentially allows other repair proteins to access the DNA termini, including DNA-PKcs, the MRE11 endonuclease, or the DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex. The finding that each Ku subunit contacts DNA to a similar extent in the minimal Ku-DNA complex stands in distinction to an earlier proposal that the interaction of Ku with DNA depends primarily on the Ku70 subunit (20Wang J. Satoh M. Chou C.H. Reeves W.H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 219-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 21Wang J. Dong X. Myung K. Hendrickson E.A. Reeves W.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 31068-31074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). That proposal was based on observations that Ku70, but not Ku80, binds DNA independently in immunoprecipitation and Southwestern blot assays. It appears, however, that both subunits contribute to binding in the native Ku heterodimer. The presence of sequence homology between the two subunits suggest that both may share a common folding pattern. Our results show, however, that at three-dimensional level the details of the DNA contacts are different for the two subunits. Ku70 binds in the major groove, whereas Ku80 apparently binds in the minor groove. The crossover between major and minor grooves occurs at the center of the complex (near probe 7′) and is geometrically necessary in order for Ku to remain primarily on one face of a B-form 14-mer. A recent study described a low resolution structure of Ku-DNA complexes obtained using a neutron contrast variation technique (33Zhao J. Wang J. Chen D.J. Peterson S.R. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These authors, who used 24-mer and 30-mer DNAs, suggested that these DNAs bind within a preformed channel that penetrates deep into the Ku protein. This model is somewhat at variance with our 14-mer cross-linking result, which strongly suggests a region of noncontact on one face of the DNA. Although the differences in the experimental methods make direct comparison difficult, one intriguing possibility is that the complex between Ku and the 14-mer represents an initial interaction with the DNA end and that additional regions of Ku come into contact with DNA when a longer sequence is present. If such contacts exist, they do not appear to influence the Ku-DNA binding equilibrium, as measured both in our laboratory and in a previous study (15Falzon M. Fewell J.W. Kuff E.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10546-10552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is possible, however, that the additional Ku-DNA contacts may play a functional role in the assembly of higher order complexes containing multiple copies of Ku and/or other repair proteins. Genetic studies have identified a number of additional proteins that participate in a Ku-dependent repair pathway (2Critchlow S.E. Jackson S.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 394-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar), and human homologues of most of these proteins are now known. The system described here, using site-specific DNA probes with a single free end, is potentially applicable to the study of higher order repair complexes. Such studies, using longer oligonucleotides to permit the recruitment of additional repair proteins, will allow the geometry of the fully active double-strand break repair complex to be further elucidated.

Although much is known about how ARF1 regulates transport in the secretory pathways, regulation of the endocytic pathways by ARF6 remains less understood. In particular, whereas cycling of ARF1 between membrane and cytosol represents a major mechanism of regulating its function, this regulation has been questioned for ARF6. In this study, we found that ARF6 is distributed both on membranes and in the cytosol. Cytosolic ARF6 is recruited to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner that is fundamentally similar to ARF1. However, unlike ARF1, release of membrane-bound ARF6 to the cytosol requires hydrolysis of GTP that is sensitive to the level of magnesium. These findings suggest that the GTPase cycle of ARF6 also regulates its distribution between membrane and cytosol and that this form of regulation will also likely be important for the function of ARF6. Moreover, as ARF6 has little intrinsic ability to hydrolyze GTP, magnesium concentration most likely affects the release of membrane-bound ARF6 by altering the activity of its GTPase-activating protein.

ADP-ribosylation factor guanine nucleotide exchange factor GTPase-activating protein Chinese hamster ovary guanosine 5′-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate) adaptor protein Intracellular transport by vesicular carriers is initiated from a membrane compartment by the recruitment of cytosolic coat proteins to their target membranes. These local membrane sites become transformed into coated buds that then mature into coated transport vesicles. Subsequently, the membrane-bound coat proteins must be released to the cytosol before a vesicle can fuse with its target compartment. Thus, regulating movement of coat proteins between membranes and cytosol represents a major mechanism of regulating intracellular transport pathways (1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T.

The recruitment of cytosolic coat proteins to membranes is regulated by the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF)1 subfamily of small GTPases. Among members of this family, ARF1 serves as the prototype and has been shown to regulate coat proteins of the coat promoter I (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

As a result, coat proteins regulated by ARF1 are also recruited from the cytosol to target membranes (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Subsequently, hydrolysis of its bound GTP deactivates ARF1 and releases ARF1 and its coat proteins from their target membranes to the cytosol (11Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B.

Thus, as with coat proteins, translocation of ARF1 between membranes and cytosol also represents a major mechanism of regulating its function. Moreover, like all members of the Ras-like small GTPase family, interconversion of ARF1 between its active and inactive states requires catalysis whereby a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) catalyzes the exchange of GDP for GTP (14Peyroche A.

ARF6 is the most distant relative of ARF1 and is the first member of the ARF subfamily characterized to regulate both membrane transport (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). ARF6 induces actin rearrangement through POR-1 (26D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), a protein that has been characterized previously to mediate actin rearrangement induced by the small GTPase Rac (27Van Aelst L. Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic details of how ARF6 regulates membrane transport of the endocytic pathways remain somewhat enigmatic. Overexpression of an activating mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) that is predicted to poorly hydrolyze GTP blocks internalization of the transferrin receptor from the cell surface to the early endosome (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Overexpression of a mutant ARF6 (T27N) that is predicted to prevent exchange of GDP for GTP blocks the internalized transferrin receptor from recycling to the cell surface (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). A recent ultrastructural study suggests that membrane-bound ARF6 localizes mainly to the recycling early endosome, suggesting that activation of ARF6 occurs at this compartment (28D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, inhibition of internalization by the activating mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) may be an indirect result of the redistribution of the early endosome to the plasma membrane such that material from the cell surface can no longer be internalized (24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Moreover, an initial fractionation study on ARF6 suggested that it is all membrane-bound, whereas all other ARFs have a significant cytosolic pool that can be recruited to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner (29Cavenagh C.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), suggesting that ARF6 does not move between membrane and cytosol like all other ARF members. A subsequent study revealed a cytosolic form of ARF6, and its abundance varied by tissue type and developmental stage (30Yang C.Z. Heimberg H. D'Souza-Schorey C. Mueckler M.M. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4006-4011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It remains unclear how this finding can be reconciled with the earlier finding that ARF6 is all membrane-bound and whether the GTPase cycle of ARF6 regulates its distribution between membrane and cytosol. In this study, we found that the distribution of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol is regulated by its GTPase cycle. Recruitment of cytosolic ARF6 to membranes requires its binding of GTP. However, unlike ARF1, release of membrane-bound ARF6 to the cytosol that requires hydrolysis of GTP is sensitive to changes in magnesium concentration, and this effect is attributable to alterations in the GAP activity on ARF6. Thus, as the GTPase cycle also regulates the distribution of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol, our finding also suggests that this form of regulation is a general characteristic of all members of the ARF subfamily. All cell lines were grown in media that were supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μm glutamine, and 20 μg/ml gentamycin. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium was used for HeLa, RBL, and RD4 cells. α-Minimal essential medium was used for HEK 293 cells, whereas RPMI 1640 medium was used for Jurkat cells. All media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. All nucleotides were obtained from Sigma. Anti-ARF6 antibody was generated as described previously (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Anti-hemagglutinin antibody (12CA5) was purchased from BabCo (Richmond, CA). Anti-human transferrin receptor antibody (H68.4) was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Different GTPase mutant constructs of ARF1 and ARF6 have been described (24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

Cells (1 × 107) were collected from culture flasks by scraping and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, followed by another wash with a buffer that contained either magnesium or EDTA. The magnesium-containing buffer consisted of 25 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 2.5 mmMgCl2, and 250 mm sucrose, as described previously (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

The EDTA-containing buffer consisted of 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, and 250 mm sucrose and was referred to as TEAS buffer previously (29Cavenagh C.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C.

Cells that were washed in either of these two buffers were then resuspended in 4 volumes of either buffer and subjected to shearing using a ball-bearing homogenizer (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany) with four passes at 36-μm clearance. The resulting homogenate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. This supernatant was further centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 1 h (TFT 80.4 rotor, Sorvall, Newtown, CT) to obtain the cytosol (supernatant) and membranes (pellet). Equal fractions of both were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting using an anti-ARF6 antibody and an anti-transferrin receptor antibody that assessed for quantitative recovery of total membranes. Blots were then visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, NEN Life Science Products). CHO cells (5 × 108) were washed as described above and then resuspended in 4 volumes of either the magnesium- or EDTA-containing buffer and homogenized, followed by centrifugation as described above. The resulting post-nuclear supernatant was layered onto a sucrose step gradient in an SW 41 tube (Beckman Instruments). Sucrose solutions were prepared in either the magnesium- or EDTA-containing buffer and layered as follows: 1 ml of 60% sucrose at the bottom, followed by 1.5 ml of 30% sucrose, 1.5 ml of 20% sucrose, and then 7 ml of homogenate. The step gradient was centrifuged (SW 41 rotor, Beckman Instruments) at 200,000 ×g for 2.5 h. The interface between 30 and 60% sucrose of the step gradient was collected as the membrane fraction, whereas those above the 20% sucrose interface was collected as cytosol. Both fractions were stored at −80 °C. After thawing, the cytosol fraction was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 40 min, and the supernatant was used for assays. 100 μl of cytosol (total protein concentration of 6–7 mg/ml) and 6 μl of total membranes (total protein concentration of 2–3 mg/ml), prepared as described above, were thawed and incubated together with various concentrations of nucleotides (as indicated in figure legends) for 45 min at 37 °C. The incubation mixture was then centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected, and the remaining membrane pellet was washed once. Equal fractions of both membranes and supernatant were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted using an anti-ARF6 antibody. Blots were visualized using ECL and then scanned for densitometry using ScionImage. Total membranes (6 μl) prepared in the EDTA-containing buffer, as described above, were incubated with 100 μl of either cytosol prepared in the magnesium-containing buffer or simply the magnesium-containing buffer alone at 4 °C for 1 h. After incubation, the incubation mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C and analyzed as membrane and cytosol fractions as described above. In experiments in which cytosol was used, calculation of membrane-bound ARF released into the cytosol was performed by quantifying the amount of ARF6 already in the cytosol and then subtracting this value from the total amount of soluble ARF6 obtained after the incubation. A subcellular fractionation study that had revealed ARF6 as all membrane-bound was performed in the presence of EDTA, where cells were homogenized in a 4-fold volume of buffer that contained 1 mm EDTA (29Cavenagh C.M.

As physiologic magnesium is in the range of 1 mm (31Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol.

However, studies on how the GTPase cycle of ARF1 regulates its distribution between membrane and cytosol were performed using magnesium concentrations in the millimolar range (3Donaldson J.G.

Thus, we first examined whether this difference in the concentration of magnesium affected the distribution of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol. Subcellular fractionation that separated total membranes from the cytosol was performed initially on a CHO cell line. ARF6 was detected by Western blotting using an anti-ARF6 antibody that was generated as described previously (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observation using CHO cells (29Cavenagh C.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), when fractionation was performed in the EDTA-containing buffer, ARF6 remained virtually all membrane-bound. However, using a buffer that contained physiologic levels of magnesium (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

In contrast, the distribution of ARF1 remained unaffected (Fig. 1), suggesting that the effect of increased magnesium was selective for ARF6. This ability of increased magnesium to alter the ARF6 distribution between membrane and cytosol was not unique to CHO cells. Subcellular fractionation using the magnesium-containing buffer revealed a significant level of cytosolic ARF6 in human embryonal kidney cells (293), human cervical epithelial cells (HeLa), human fibrosarcoma cells (RD4), human T cells (Jurkat), and rat basophilic granulocytic cells (RBL) (Fig.2).Figure 2Magnesium-induced redistribution of ARF6 from membranes to the cytosol is independent of cell type. The cell lines as shown were homogenized with the magnesium-containing buffer and then fractionated into total membranes (M) and the cytosol (C), followed by immunoblotting with an anti-ARF6 antibody (lower panel) and an anti-transferrin receptor (TfR) antibody to assess quantitative recovery of total membranes (upper panel). The relative fractions of ARF6 on membranes and in the cytosol were then quantified by densitometry.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) As the GTPase cycle regulates the distribution of ARF1 between membrane and cytosol (3Donaldson J.G.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), we examined whether the cytosolic form of ARF6 induced by increased magnesium could be recruited to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner. In a recruitment assay, we found that more cytosolic ARF6 was recruited to membranes with increasing concentrations of GTPγS (Fig. 3). Significantly, this recruitment assay was performed using the magnesium-containing buffer. Thus, the finding that the effect of GTPγS in promoting more membrane-bound ARF6 dominated over the effect of magnesium that induced more cytosolic ARF6 suggested that the ARF6 distribution was regulated more directly by its GTPase cycle than by the effect of magnesium. In support of this finding, we sought to inhibit hydrolysis of GTP bound to ARF6 more selectively by examining a GTPase mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) that is predicted to poorly hydrolyze GTP (24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Transfecting ARF6 Q67L into cells followed by subcellular fractionation using the magnesium-containing buffer, we found that the Q67L mutant localized on membranes more efficiently than wild-type ARF6 (Fig.4). This difference was similar to that observed between an activating mutant of ARF1 (Q71I) that poorly hydrolyzed GTP (12Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and wild-type ARF1 (Fig. 4). For both ARF1 and ARF6, the activating mutation caused a relative, but not complete, shift in the distribution of the mutants to membranes. This partial shift can be attributed to the previous finding that the activating point mutation only partially inhibits hydrolysis of GTP on ARF1, as compared with a more complete block of hydrolysis induced by GTPγS (11Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 12Teal S.B. Hsu V.W. Peters P.J. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3135-3138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the similar effects of the activating point mutation on the distribution of ARF1 and ARF6 further suggested that the GTPase cycle of ARF6, like that of ARF1, directly regulated its movement between membrane and cytosol. In contrast to GTPγS, GDPβS did not stabilize ARF6 on membranes (Fig. 5). Thus, this result corroborated with the above findings suggesting that the GTP-bound form stabilized ARF6 on membranes. Significantly, GTP was also unable to induce the membrane-bound form of ARF6 (Fig. 5). This result was reminiscent of the recruitment of cytosolic ARF1 to membranes. GTPγS, but not GTP, stabilized ARF1 on membranes because its GAP was too active to allow accumulation of membrane-bound ARF1 in the presence of GTP (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12083-12089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggested why subcellular fractionation revealed mainly cytosolic ARF1, as the ARF1 GAP activity appeared highly active even at 4 °C during subcellular fractionation (32Ostermann J. Orci L. Tani K. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Elazar Z. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 1015-1025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). To begin investigating whether increasing magnesium used a similar mechanism to redistribute ARF6 from membranes to the cytosol, we first isolated the membrane-bound fraction of ARF6 in the EDTA-containing buffer that allowed significant accumulation of ARF6 on membranes. This membrane was then incubated at 4 °C with cytosol that was prepared in the magnesium-containing buffer. When incubated together, a significant fraction of membrane-bound ARF6 became soluble (Fig. 6). To ensure that this redistribution of ARF6 is not simply due to a re-mixing of membranes with cytosol, total membranes and cytosol were both prepared in the EDTA-containing buffer and then incubated together. This incubation revealed no significant redistribution of ARF6 to the cytosol (Fig. 6), suggesting that increasing magnesium also induced an activity at 4 °C to redistribute ARF6 from membranes to the cytosol. As cytosolic ARF1 could be induced by either inhibiting its GEF activity that prevents its recruitment from the cytosol to membranes or enhancing its GAP activity that facilitates its release from membranes to the cytosol, we also examined which regulatory activity on ARF6 was affected by magnesium to induce cytosolic ARF6. Thus, to examine whether increasing magnesium induced cytosolic ARF6 by inhibiting its GEF activity, we performed a recruitment assay in the presence of GTPγS that blocked the possibility of magnesium acting through a GAP activity to induce more cytosolic ARF6. Under this condition, more membrane-bound ARF6 was observed using the magnesium-containing buffer compared with the EDTA-containing buffer (Fig.7). Thus, cytosolic ARF6 induced by increasing magnesium could not be attributed to inhibition of the GEF activity on ARF6, suggesting that magnesium most likely induced its effect by enhancing the GAP activity on ARF6. To test more directly whether a GAP activity on ARF6 would enhance its release from membranes, we prepared total membranes in the EDTA-containing buffer to accumulate a significant fraction of membrane-bound ARF6. This membrane fraction was then incubated with the magnesium-containing buffer that lacked cytosol. In this type of simplified incubation, a significant fraction of membrane-bound ARF6 was released (Fig. 8). Thus, as this incubation started with ARF6 only in the membrane-bound fraction, its result suggested that a membrane-localized activity was activated by magnesium to release ARF6 from membranes. Significantly, the degree of this release was less than that seen when incubation was performed using cytosol prepared from the magnesium-containing buffer (compare Figs. 6 and 8), suggesting that the cytosol had additional factor(s) that potentiated a membrane-localized activity to release membrane-bound ARF6. To show that the magnesium-induced release of membrane-bound ARF6 was attributable to hydrolysis of GTP, we next examined whether ARF6 that had been loaded onto membranes with GTPγS could be released when subsequently incubated in the magnesium-containing buffer. For this purpose, membranes and cytosol that were prepared in the magnesium-containing buffer were incubated with GTPγS, and membrane-bound ARF6 was isolated by centrifugation. When isolated in this manner, membrane-bound ARF6 became resistant to release by the magnesium-containing buffer (Fig. 8), suggesting that increasing magnesium enhanced the release of membrane-bound ARF6 by facilitating the hydrolysis of GTP. In this study, we found that a difference in the level of magnesium alters the distribution of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol. Elucidating the underlying mechanism, we found that ARF6 is recruited from the cytosol to membranes in a GTP-dependent manner and is released back to the cytosol by increasing magnesium, which facilitates hydrolysis of GTP. Thus, these findings suggest that translocation of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol is regulated by its GTPase cycle. As ARF6 has little intrinsic ability to hydrolyze GTP (33Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15583-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), our findings also suggest that increasing magnesium induces cytosolic ARF6 by enhancing its GAP activity. Our study used indirect approaches to show that the ARF6 distribution is regulated by its GTPase cycle because approaches that might be more direct are also technically unfeasible. For example, one can envisage immunoprecipitating ARF6 from membrane and cytosol fractions and then examining the guanine nucleotide bound to ARF6 derived from these two fractions. However, this direct approach requires an immunoprecipitating antibody that is capable of stabilizing binding of a small GTPase to its guanine nucleotide (34Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), and such an antibody has not been identified for small GTPases other than Ras (35Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). Thus, as done for ARF1 (3Donaldson J.G. Cassel D. Kahn R.A. Klausner R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6408-6412Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 4Palmer D.J. Helms J.B. Beckers C.J. Orci L. Rothman J.E. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 9272-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we also used indirect approaches to show that binding of GTP localizes ARF6 to membranes. We found that GTPγS, but not GDPβS, supports recruitment of cytosolic ARF6 to membranes. Moreover, a point mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) that is predicted to poorly hydrolyze its bound GTP associates with membranes better than its wild-type counterpart. Thus, these results suggest that the GTPase cycle of ARF6 regulates its distribution between membrane and cytosol in a manner that is fundamentally similar to that seen for ARF1. Significantly, these results also suggest that potential mechanisms independent of the GTPase cycle as an explanation for how magnesium redistributes ARF6 would be unlikely. For example, one can envisage a mechanism of proteolysis whereby a magnesium-sensitive protease is activated to directly cleave a proteinaceous docking site used by ARF6 to bind membranes. However, such a mechanism cannot readily explain our finding that the magnesium-induced redistribution of membrane-bound ARF6 to the cytosol is blocked when GTP hydrolysis is inhibited. As magnesium appears to affect the ARF6 distribution through its GTPase cycle, this finding has mechanistic parallels to how brefeldin A affects the ARF1 distribution. Brefeldin A induces the cytosolic form of ARF1 by inhibiting its GEF activity, which then allows the GDP-bound form of ARF1 to predominate (36Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 37Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In this regard, increasing magnesium can potentially induce cytosolic ARF6 by either inhibiting a GEF activity to prevent the recruitment of cytosolic ARF6 to membranes or enhancing a GAP activity to facilitate the release of membrane-bound ARF6 to the cytosol. To address this issue, we assessed whether increasing magnesium inhibits the recruitment of cytosolic ARF6 to membranes by examining its recruitment in the presence of GTPγS, which blocks the contribution of the ARF6 GAP activity. As this recruitment is enhanced upon increasing magnesium (see Fig. 7), this result suggests that the redistribution of ARF6 from membrane to cytosol cannot be explained by inhibition of the ARF6 GEF activity by magnesium. Thus, this result suggests that magnesium affects the ARF6 distribution mainly by enhancing its GAP activity. A seeming contradiction to our findings is the previous observation that both the activating (Q67L) and deactivating (T27N) mutants of ARF6 are localized on membranes (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This observation has the appearance that both the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of ARF6 are localized on membranes and thus reinforces the previous notion that the GTPase cycle of ARF6 does not regulate its distribution between membrane and cytosol (29Cavenagh C.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). An explanation for this apparent contradiction is suggested, however, by the elucidation of how the equivalent point mutations in Ras affect its GTPase cycle (38Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar, 39Dascher C. Balch W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1437-1448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Significantly, whereas the equivalent mutation of ARF6 Q67L in Ras represents a GTP-bound form of Ras, the equivalent mutation of ARF6 T27N in Ras does not appear to represent a GDP-bound form of Ras. The exchange of GDP for GTP on Ras represents a two-step mechanism whereby a GEF activity displaces GDP bound to Ras and results in a transition state of Ras that has an empty GTP-binding pocket. Subsequently, GTP fills the pocket to generate the GTP-bound form of Ras. Thus, ARF6 T27N is likely to represent a transition state of ARF6 that is devoid of a guanine nucleotide, rather than its GDP-bound form. An important implication for the transition state of Ras is that it interacts more tightly with its GEF than the wild-type counterpart. Thus, overexpression of the transition state mutant results in a dominant-negative phenotype because the GEF can no longer act on endogenous wild-type Ras. In this regard, the phenotypic manifestations of ARF6 T27N could be attributed to its ability to block the function of endogenous wild-type ARF6 by sequestering GEFs that act on ARF6 (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar,24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, because this GEF activity is likely to be membrane-bound, as seen for ARF1 GEF (36, 37, and 39), ARF6 T27N would be predicted to associate with membranes rather than to reside in the cytosol. Indeed, we have found recently, by both subcellular fractionation and immunogold electron microscopy, that ARF6 T27N and its equivalent mutant in ARF1 (T31N) are associated with membranes to similar degrees. 2P. J. Peters and V. W. Hsu, manuscript in preparation. Thus, the fundamental parallels that we have seen for how the GTPase cycle regulates the distribution of both ARF1 and ARF6 are further supported by the behavior of their point mutants that affect the GTPase cycle. As cytosolic magnesium is thought to exist in the millimolar range (31Franco M. Chardin P. Chabre M. Paris S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1337-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) rather than the submicromolar range, which was used initially to study the distribution of ARF6 (29Cavenagh C.M. Whitney J.A. Carroll K. Zhang C. Boman A.L. Rosenwald A.G. Mellman I. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21767-21774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), our study suggests that ARF6 is likely to have a significant cytosol fractionin vivo. In considering how our findings might relate to regulation of endocytic transport by ARF6, we are led by the recent suggestion that ARF6 is likely to be activated on endosomal membranes to regulate the recycling pathway of endocytosis (28D'Souza-Schorey C. van Donselaar E. Hsu V.W. Yang C. Stahl P.D. Peters P.J. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose that a GEF activates ARF6 for its recruitment from the cytosol to endosomal membranes to initiate the formation of transport carriers from this compartment. However, given what is currently known, the role of a GAP that acts on ARF6 in this transport pathway is more difficult to pinpoint. Although studies on ARF1 suggest that GAP should act to release ARF6 from its transport vesicles prior to their fusion with the plasma membrane (11Tanigawa G. Orci L. Amherdt M. Ravazzola M. Helms J.B. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1365-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), the activating mutant of ARF6 (Q67L) has been shown to reside on the plasma membrane (23D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that GAP acts to release ARF6 only after its transport vesicles have fused with the plasma membrane. Because coated vesicles are thought to fuse only with their target compartment after uncoating (1Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 2Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1532Crossref PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar), the effect of ARF6 Q67L suggests the possibility that deactivation of ARF6 does not regulate the uncoating of its transport vesicles. As current evidence does not support this possibility, an alternative explanation that seems more likely is that constitutive activation of ARF6 through the use of the Q67L mutant may lead to secondary effects that confound the true nature of how GAP acts. Significantly, ARF6 Q67L also induces the redistribution of the early endosome to the plasma membrane (24Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1003-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Thus, although this activating mutant can localize on the resulting mixed membrane compartment, it might not be capable of recruiting the ARF6-regulated coat to this compartment because this coat recruitment might occur only in an endosome-specific context. This explanation suggests that the GTPase cycle of ARF6 can be uncoupled with respect to its ability to recruit coat, when a mixed compartment of plasma membrane and early endosome is induced. Insight into the actual explanation will likely be forthcoming once the putative coat regulated by ARF6 is identified and characterized. On the other hand, another aspect of our study may provide insight into potential regulatory mechanisms that govern the GAP activity on ARF6. Although more cytosolic ARF6 induced by increasing magnesium could be attributed to enhancing the ARF6 GAP activity, the ARF1 distribution is not affected similarly, suggesting that its GAP activity does not vary over the range of magnesium concentrations examined in our study. This disparity between the GAP activities of ARF1 and ARF6 suggests that the GAPs for ARF1 and ARF6 may be regulated in significantly different ways. Relevant to this possibility, ARF6 has been shown to regulate not only endocytic transport, but also actin rearrangement (25Radhakrishna H. Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 935-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 26D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Van Aelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), and these two events are also regulated by the Rho family of small GTPases during the formation of surface membrane protrusions (40Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3735) Google Scholar, 41Lamaze C. Chuan T.-H. Terlecky L.J. Bokoch G.M. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1996; 382: 177-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Thus, an intriguing possibility is that upstream regulation of ARF6 through its GAP might be subject to intracellular signaling mechanisms that regulate membrane protrusions (42Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 43Sanchez-Madrid F. Angel del Pozo M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Consistent with this possibility, ARF6 has been shown recently to regulate cell spreading (44Song J. Khachikian Z. Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 2257-2267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a process that occurs through the formation of membrane protrusions. Moreover, this possibility would explain why different cell types exhibit different degrees of membrane-bound ARF6 (see Fig.2), as different cell types are likely to exhibit different capacities to form membrane protrusions. Finally, as this process is regulated by calcium signaling (42Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 43Sanchez-Madrid F. Angel del Pozo M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), it will be interesting to examine in the future whether calcium also affects the distribution of ARF6 between membrane and cytosol.

Using the Jurkat T lymphocyte cell line, we found that a stably expressed Gi protein-coupled receptor (the δ-opioid receptor (DOR1)) stimulates MEK-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1 and ERK2) and transcriptional activity by an ERK target, Elk-1, via a mechanism requiring a PTX-sensitive Gi protein.

Analysis of this βγ-independent pathway indicates a role for a herbimycin A-sensitive tyrosine kinase. Unlike βγ-mediated pathways, the βγ-independent pathway was insensitive to RasN17, inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase), and constitutive PI 3-kinase activity. The βγ-independent pathway regulates downstream events, since blocking it abrogated both Elk-1-dependent transcription and mobilization of the mitogenic transcription factor, AP-1, in response to DOR1 signaling.

The βγ-independent pathway regulates downstream events, since blocking it abrogated both Elk-1-dependent transcription and mobilization of the mitogenic transcription factor, AP-1, in response to DOR1 signaling. These results characterize a novel, Ras- and PI 3kinase-independent pathway for ERK activation by Gi protein signaling that is distinct from ERK activation by βγ and may therefore be mediated by the αi subunit. β-adrenergic receptor kinase-1 C-terminal fragment δ-opioid receptor d-Ala2-deltorphin II extracellular signal-regulated kinase interleukin-2 phosphatidylinositol pertussis toxin control pertussis toxin containing only the B oligomer phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate the T lymphocyte antigen receptor-CD3 complex polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis monoclonal antibody glutathione S-transferase myelin basic protein Gi protein signaling in many cell types stimulates the activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs),1 ERK1 and ERK2 (Refs.1Alblas J. van Corven E.J.

Like other G proteins, Gi proteins consist of an α subunit and a dimeric βγ subunit and mediate activation of intracellular signaling pathways in response to the ligation of receptors with seven transmembrane-spanning domains. When stimulated by a ligand-bound receptor, the α subunit binds GTP and dissociates from βγ. This event allows both α-GTP and free βγ to directly regulate the activities of downstream effector molecules. Gi proteins contain one of the closely related αi subunits (αi1, αi2, αi3) in addition to β and γ subunits shared by other types of G proteins. Pertussis toxin (PTX) covalently modifies Gi protein αi subunits, preventing Gi protein activation by ligated receptors. Besides Go and Gt, only Gi proteins are inactivated by PTX. In epithelial and fibroblast cells, certain Gi- or Go-coupled receptors activate ERK by liberating G protein βγ subunits that directly stimulate an isoform of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI 3-kinase) (p110-γ) (8Hawes B.E.

J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7987-7990Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a result suggesting that αi and βγ activate ERK via distinct pathways. Moreover, the m1-muscarinic and platelet-activating factor receptors use the closely related PTX-sensitive αo subunit to activate ERK via a Ras-independent pathway in the Chinese hamster ovary epithelial cell line (10van Biesen T.

An interesting feature of this pathway is its cell type specificity; in COS-7 fibroblasts, these same receptors use βγ and Ras to stimulate ERK (10van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Raymond J.R. Luttrell L.M.

This resembles the cell-specific actions of gip2, which transforms Rat-1a cells but not NIH 3T3 or Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (24Gupta S.K. Gallego C. Lowndes J.M. Pleiman c.M. Sable C. Eisfelder B.J.

Although recent work has uncovered novel mechanisms for Gi protein stimulation of ERK activity in fibroblast and epithelial cell types (above), little is known about the molecular mechanisms of ERK activation by Gi protein signaling in mammalian lymphocytes. We recently reported that signaling by a heterologously expressed Gi protein-coupled δ-opioid receptor (DOR1) uses a PTX-sensitive mechanism to stimulate the accumulation of AP-1 transcription factor complexes in the Jurkat human T lymphocyte cell line (35Hedin K.E. Duerson D. Clapham D.E. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that DOR1 signaling activates ERK via a novel, Ras-independent, Giprotein-mediated pathway. We further present evidence that this pathway is independent of βγ, characterize this pathway as distinct from previously characterized βγ-mediated ERK activation pathways, and demonstrate that this pathway leads to PTX-sensitive AP-1 mobilization in these cells. DOR1/Ju.1 cells were derived by fluorescence-activated cell sorting of the Ju.1 Jurkat T cell subline that was stably transfected with DOR1, as described previously (36Sharp B.M. Shahabi N.A.

All cells were maintained in Medium B (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 5% calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2 μm2-mercaptoethanol). DOR1 expression by the DOR1/Ju.1 cell line was confirmed by assays every few months as described (35Hedin K.E. Duerson D. Clapham D.E. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Cells were preincubated 16–24 h in Medium C (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 2 mml-glutamine, and 2 μm 2-mercaptoethanol) and then washed and resuspended in Medium C at a density of 106cells/ml. Cells were stimulated as indicated for 5 min at 37 °C, pelleted by rapid centrifugation, and lysed in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (using approximately 2 × 106 cell equivalents/lane) and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Corp., Bedford, MA). The presence of active ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylated on threonine 202 and tyrosine 204 was detected by immunoblotting with phosphospecific p44/p42 ERK1 and ERK2 (Thr202/Tyr204) antiserum, while total ERK2 protein was detected using p44 ERK kinase antiserum (both antisera from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA).

Elk-1 dependent transcriptional activity was assayed using the PathDetect Elktrans-Reporting System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Cells (107) were mixed with 5 μg of pFR-Luc and 0.5 μg of pFA-Elk with or without transient expression constructs described below plus irrelevant plasmid DNA (pcDNAIII; Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), electroporated using a BTX Electro-square porator model T820 (BTX Inc., San Diego, CA), divided into 4–6 portions, and cultured in 2 ml of Medium B or Medium C in wells of a 24-well plate for 18–24 h at 37 °C. Results were similar following culture in Medium B or C, which contain 10% and 0.5% serum, respectively. Stimuli were added to some wells for an additional 5–6 h, and then the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) and a model LB 9501/16 lumat (Berthold Systems, Aliquippa, PA). DOR1-stimulated Elk1/GAL4 activity was calculated relative to that of unstimulated cells from the same transfection. To compare different transfections done the same day, the cells were additionally transfected with 20 ng of pRL-TK (Promega, Madison, WI), which encodes a Renilla luciferase gene downstream of a minimal HSV-TK promoter. Following stimulation of transfected cells, bothRenilla luciferase and luciferase were measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega), and the Renillavalues were used for normalization.

The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the pEF-BOS expression vector (42Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1502) Google Scholar) and sequenced to yield pEF-BOS-FLAG-iSH2-CAAX. To make pEF-BOS-AU1-AKT, polymerase chain reaction was first used to isolate the human Akt cDNA and to substitute sequences encoding the AU1 epitope tag (MDTYRYI) and a flexible linker (GAGAGAP) for the initiating ATG. This polymerase chain reaction product was then subcloned into pEF-BOS and sequenced to yield pEF-BOS-AU1-AKT. Cells (107) were transfected with 5 μg of an expression vector encoding Myc-tagged MEK-1 (Myc-MEK-1) with or without other expression plasmids and plated in Medium B. 24 h later, Myc-MEK-1 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-Myc mAb (Babco, Berkley, CA), and an in vitro kinase assay was performed as described (43Kohn A.D.

Results were visualized by SDS-PAGE, Western transfer to Immobilon P membrane, and autoradiography, and/or PhosphorImager analysis using a Storm model 840 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Quantitation was performed by PhosphorImager analysis. Total immunoprecipitated Myc-MEK-1 was visualized by immunoblotting with anti-MEK-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). To make the recombinant Vaccinia viruses, the coding sequence of human CD56 or human Ha-RasN17 was blunt end-cloned into the SmaI site of the Vaccinia virus expression vector, pSC11. The resulting vectors were introduced into the WR strain ofVaccinia via homologous recombination, and high titer viral stocks were prepared as described (45Ting A.T. Dick C.J. Schoon R.A.

Stocks of the WR (wild-type/parental) strain Vaccinia virus were a generous gift of Dr. Paul Leibson (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN). Mutant Ras expression by the RasN17 recombinant virus was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing of the viral stock (data not shown) and by anti-Ras immunoblotting of infected cells (Fig. 5, B and C). Semipurified recombinant CD56, RasN17, or WR (control) viruses were used for infection. For each experiment, 4 × 107 cells were infected in 8.0 ml of RPMI 1640 for 1 h at 37 °C at a multiplicity of infection of 20:1. One volume of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum was then added, and the cells were incubated for an additional 1 h at 37 °C. Infected cells were washed twice with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% fetal calf serum and either immediately incubated with anti-CD56 mAb coupled to phycoerythrin (Becton-Dickenson, San Jose, CA) and analyzed by flow cytometry or divided into six equal portions and used for endogenous MEK-1 and/or ERK2 kinase assays as described below. Cells (2 × 106/test) were stimulated as indicated at 37 °C in medium consisting of RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin and lysed as described by Kohn et al. (43Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S.

Endogenous MEK-1 and/or ERK2 was immunoprecipitated using specific antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and in vitro kinase assays performed as for the Myc-MEK-1 assay above, using as substrate either 1 μg/test of kinase-inactive ERK2-GST fusion protein (for MEK-1 assay) or 5 μg/test of myelin basic protein (MBP) (for ERK2 assay; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Immunoblotting was used to quantitate the amounts of ERK2 or MEK-1 immunoprecipitated for each test (anti-ERK2 and anti-MEK-1 antisera from Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Where indicated, 120 of the total lysate was reserved and analyzed by immunoblotting for RasN17 expression using anti-Ha-Ras antisera (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Cells (2 × 107) were transfected with 5 μg of an expression vector encoding AU1-tagged Akt (pEF-BOS-AU1-AKT) with or without 10 μg of pEF-BOS-FLAG-iSH2-CAAX and plated in Medium B. 24 h later, Akt was immunoprecipitated using an anti-AU1 mAb (Babco, Berkley, CA), and an in vitro kinase assay was performed using myelin basic protein as a substrate (43Kohn A.D. Kovacina K.S. Roth R.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4288-4295Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Results were visualized by SDS-PAGE, transfer to Immobilon P membrane, and autoradiography. Immunoprecipitated Akt was visualized by immunoblotting with sheep anti-Akt antiserum and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-sheep IgG (both antisera from Upstate Biotechnology). Cells were pretreated and stimulated as indicated in Medium B at a density of 5 × 105 to 8 × 105 cells/ml, and total RNA was prepared using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). RNA (10 μg/lane) was fractionated by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with32P-labeled c-Fos and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA probes using standard procedures. Cells were stimulated for 4 h in Medium B at a density of 5 × 105 to 8 × 105 cells/ml. Nuclear extracts were prepared (35Hedin K.E. Duerson D. Clapham D.E. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 505-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and AP-1 DNA-binding complexes were assayed by electromobility shift assay as described (37McKean D.J. Huntoon C. Bell M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1321-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA probe was 5′-AAATCCAATGAGTCAGCGCGGAT-3′, which contains a high affinity AP-1 binding site (underlined). Cells (107) in Medium B were transfected with 10 μg of irrelevant plasmid DNA (pcDNAIII; Invitrogen) and 20 μg of the AP-1 reporter plasmid, pGL-AP1-Luc (generously provided by E. O'Neill (Merck)), which contains three tandem repeats of a sequence (5′-GTGACTCAGCGCG-3′) with a high affinity AP-1 binding site (underlined) upstream of a minimal γ-fibrinogen promoter (46Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) and a luciferase gene. Following culture in Medium C for 18–24 h at 37 °C, cells were pretreated and stimulated for an additional 5–6 h before reporter activity was assayed by luciferase as above. To address the potential for mitogenic signaling by Giproteins in lymphocytes, we first asked whether receptor-mediated activation of endogenous Gi proteins could stimulate ERK activity in a lymphoid cell line. For this purpose, we used DOR1/Ju.1 cells, a Jurkat T cell line stably transfected with an expression vector encoding the Gi protein-coupled receptor, DOR1 (35Hedin K.E. Duerson D. Clapham D.E. Cell.

Fig. 1 A shows that treatment with 10−7m deltorphin stimulated the appearance of active, phosphorylated ERK1 and ERK2 in DOR1/Ju.1 cell lysates. This effect of deltorphin required Gi proteins since DOR1, but not PMA, activation of ERK was abrogated by pretreatment with PTX. DOR1 activation of ERK1 and ERK2 most likely requires upstream MEK activation, since ERK activation was sensitive to the specific MEK inhibitor, PD098059 (Fig. 1 A) (47Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P.

CAP/Srv2p assists the small G protein Ras to activate adenylyl cyclase. CAP also regulates the cytoskeleton through an actin sequestering activity and is directed to cortical actin patches by a proline-rich SH3-binding site (P2). In this report we analyze the role of the actin cytoskeleton in Ras/cAMP signaling. Two alleles of CAP, L16P(Srv2) and R19T (SupC), first isolated in genetic screens for mutants that attenuate cAMP levels, reduced adenylyl cyclase binding, and cortical actin patch localization. A third mutation, L27F, also failed to localize but showed no loss of either cAMP signaling or adenylyl cyclase binding. However, all three N-terminal mutations reduced CAP-CAP multimer formation and SH3 domain binding, although the SH3-binding site is about 350 amino acids away. Finally, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with latrunculin-A did not affect the cAMP phenotypes of the hyperactive Ras2Val19 allele. These data identify a novel region of CAP that controls access to the SH3-binding site and demonstrate that cytoskeletal localization of CAP or an intact cytoskeleton per se is not necessary for cAMP signaling.

It is widely conserved in evolution, and many homologs are interchangeable in genetic and biochemical assays. All Ras proteins are small G proteins, active when bound to GTP but inactive when bound to GDP. Oncogenic Ras mutants contain amino acid substitutions that reduce the GTPase activity resulting in elevated levels of GTP-bound Ras. Upon activation by GTP binding, Ras activates downstream proteins known as effectors (for reviews see Refs. 1Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 2Lowy D.R. Willumsen B.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 851-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 3Marshall M.S. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1311-1318Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Ras signals can be divided into two categories, those controlling transcription through mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades and those controlling cell morphology and the actin cytoskeleton through alternate pathways (4Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4212) Google Scholar). In most organisms Ras regulates the actin cytoskeleton through subsequent activation of the Rho family of G proteins to initiate a cascade of small GTPases (5Ridley A.J. Paterson H.F. Johnston C.L.

Ras has not, however, been shown to regulate actin in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, although Ras regulates morphogenesis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe through a GTPase cascade to the Rho family member Cdc42sp (8Chang E. Barr M. Wang Y. Jung V. Xu H.-P. Wigler M. Cell. 1994; 79: 131-141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Adenylyl cyclase, which is the Ras effector in the yeast S. cerevisiae, was the first protein identified that interacted with a Ras ortholog (9Toda T. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Powers S. Kataoka T. Broek D.

Ras regulates adenylyl cyclase by activating its only known activity, catalysis of ATP into the second messenger cAMP. The catalytic subunit is ∼220 kDa in size and can be divided into five functional regions: (i) a N-terminal region of no known function, (ii) a leucine-rich repeat Ras-binding region (12Field J.

Ras activates the catalytic activity through direct binding to the second region. The role of CAP in cAMP signaling is to facilitate Ras activation of adenylyl cyclase, perhaps by binding the farnesyl group at the Ras C terminus (18Shima F. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yanagihara C.

The adenylyl cyclase interacting region of CAP was mapped genetically and later biochemically to the N terminus of CAP. This region binds the C terminus of adenylyl cyclase, perhaps through a coiled-coil interaction (16Mintzer K.A. Field J. Cell. Signalling. 1994; 6: 681-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Nishida Y. Shima F. Sen H. Tanaka Y. Yanagihara C. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Kariya K. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Loss of CAP causes an abnormal yeast morphology and disrupts the actin cytoskeleton. The actin-associated phenotypes are partially restored by overexpression of the C terminus of CAP or the actin monomer-binding protein, profilin (20Gerst J.E. Ferguson K. Vojtek A. Wigler M. Field J.

Furthermore, the first mammalian homolog CAP1, or ASP-56, was isolated as an actin monomer-binding protein (24Gieselmann R. Mann K. FEBS Lett. 1992; 298: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). All other homologs, where tested, also bind actin through the C-terminal region (25Gottwald U. Brokamp R. Karakesisoglou I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 18243-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All CAP homologs contain a centrally located proline-rich region. In yeast, this domain can be subdivided into two regions, the P1 and the P2 sites. The P1 site, found in almost all homologs, contains a 10–12-amino acid stretch composed almost entirely of prolines, and its function remains unknown. The P2 region contains a consensus SH3-binding motif (PXXP), binds SH3 domains in vitro, and is required to direct CAP to cortical actin patches (28Freeman N.L. Lila T. Mintzer K.A. Chen Z. Pahk A.J. Ren R. Drubin D.G. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Abp1p (actin filament-binding protein 1) can bind the P2 region through its SH3 domain and is a strong candidate for a targeting protein because abp1 strains have reduced levels of CAP in cortical actin patches (29Lila T. Drubin D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 367-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). 1J. Yu and J. Field, unpublished observations. 1J. Yu and J. Field, unpublished observations. Localization of CAP to the actin cytoskeleton suggests that it may translocate adenylyl cyclase to actin cortical patches, hence serving as an adapter protein. However, deletion studies found that the N-terminal region of CAP was sufficient to restore heat shock sensitivity to a cap::Ras2Val19 strain, whereas the C-terminal region of CAP restored only the actin-related phenotypes (20Gerst J.E. Ferguson K. Vojtek A. Wigler M. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1248-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Moreover, no actin phenotypes have been observed in any Ras mutants. Together, these observations suggest that CAP regulates cAMP and actin independently. However, studies to date either inferred the role of CAP by deleting the CAP-binding site on adenylyl cyclase or tested CAP mutations in Ras2Val19 strains (15Fedor-Chaiken M. Deschenes R.J. Broach J.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 329-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30Wang J. Suzuki N. Nishida Y. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4087-4097Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Ras2Val19 strains harbor an activated Ras. Wild type cells require Cdc25p to activate Ras by GTP exchange (31Robinson L.C. Gibbs J.B. Marshall M.S. Sigal I.S. Tatchell K. Science. 1987; 235: 1218-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 32Broek D. Toda T. Michaeli T. Levin L. Birchmeier C. Zoller M. Powers S.

Thus, if CAP or the actin cytoskeleton was required for Cdc25p to activate Ras, no effects on cAMP signaling would have been observed in the previous studies. Another conserved region of CAP is found in the extreme N terminus within the adenylyl cyclase-binding site (see Fig. 1). The reason for the conservation of the adenylyl cyclase-binding site is not clear, because mammalian homologs do not associate with particulate adenylyl cyclase in platelets, where both are highly expressed. In addition, the CAP-binding domain of adenylyl cyclase is not conserved in mammalian cyclases. 2N. Freeman and J. Field, unpublished observations. 2N. Freeman and J. Field, unpublished observations. Recently, this region of CAP was found to associate with CAP itself, suggesting that a multi-subunit complex may form consisting of two or more molecules of CAP and actin (26Hubberstey A. Yu G. Loewith R. Lakusta C. Young D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 459-466Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 27Zelicof A. Protopopov V. David D. Lin X. Lustgarten V. Gerst J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18243-18252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that the adenylyl cyclase-binding region is required for subcellular localization of CAP to actin cortical patches, but the localization function can be separated from the adenylyl cyclase binding function and cAMP signaling through effector mutants. Evidence is presented that this region is required for CAP self-association and access to the SH3-binding site to direct subcellular localization. Because this domain is found in all CAP homologs, its function is likely to be conserved. Furthermore, we demonstrate that disruption of the actin cytoskeleton does not block Ras coupling to adenylyl cyclase. For YCP50-CAP plasmids, CAP was amplified using the forward primer 5′-CATCAGAAAGCTTGAGGGGAG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CGCTGTATACCTAAGGGATCC-3′ from genomic DNA of wild type yeast (SP1) and yeast containing mutant CAP (YO19 and TKR1–2LS). The amplified fragments contained 1279 base pairs upstream of the start codon and 390 base pairs downstream of the stop codon and were cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of YCP50. Mutagenesis was performed by the unique restriction site elimination method (36Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). The CAP-L27F point mutant was generated by the primer 5′-ACTGCAAGATTCGAAGATGTCACCATC-3′, which introduced a BstBI restriction site. The ΔP2 mutant was generated by the primer 5′-TCCGGTCCAGCACCTCGAGCAAAAAAGCCATC-3′, which introduced aXhoI site. Primer 5′-ATCAGTCAAAAGTCTAGAGCAACAATACAC-3′ replaced a unique MluI restriction site with anXbaI site. Mut S strain was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). HindIII and BamHI fragments from these and mutagenized plasmids were subcloned into theHindIII and BamHI sites of pRS415 to generate pRS415-based CAP plasmids. GFP-CAP3 plasmids were made using a yeast GFP galactose-inducible vector (pTS395) provided by Tim Stearns. The wild type GFP was replaced with the S65T mutant as aXbaI and NotI fragment by amplifying from template provided by Roger Tsien (pRSET-S65T) (37Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar) using the forward primer 5′-GCGCGCTCTAGACTCGAGATGAGTAAAGGAGGAGGACTT-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CGCTAGCGGCCGCTTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCAT-3′. Full-length CAP and the deletions Δ12 and Δ14 were amplified from pADH-CAP using the forward primer 5′-CATTAAGGATCCCATGCCTGACTCTAAGTACAC-3′ and the reverse primers 5′-CTCGCATCTAGAACCAGCATGTTCGAAAAC-3′, 5′-GGAGATTCTAGATAGGGAATGGTTAACTTG-3′, and 5′-TTTTGGTCTAGATGGTGGACCGGATTTACT-3′, respectively. Full-length CAP point mutants were amplified from the YCP50-based CAP plasmids using the appropriate primers listed above. The amplified fragments were cloned into the BamHI and XbaI sites of the modified GFP vector pGFP. The Δ12 and Δ14 CAP deletions truncate the protein at amino acids 455 and 355, respectively. For GFP immunoprecipitations and GST-ABP1-SH3 coprecipitations, yeast (DDY817 with appropriate plasmids) were grown in 1 liter of synthetic medium containing glucose, galactose, and appropriate supplements to select for plasmids for 4–5 days at 25 °C.

The system used was a modified version of the Brent system (41Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The following plasmids and vectors were used: pSH18–34, URA3 LexA-operator/LacZ reporter; pEG202, HIS3 plasmid containing LexA fusion protein (“bait”); pJG4–5, TRP1 plasmid containing expression library or specific interactor protein; pSH17–4, HIS3 plasmid, LexA fused to the activation domain of GAL4, positive control for activation. The system was carried out in the yeast strain EGY48. β-Galactosidase activity was measured as described (42Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Yeast cells (JF7C with appropriate plasmids) were grown on YPDGalactose plates for 5–6 days to induce production of the GFP-CAP fusions. Cells were then incubated in YPDGalactose liquid medium for 3 h at 30 °C. 600 μl of saturated culture were washed twice with water and suspended in 20 μl of 2% polylysine and mounted onto a slide to view live yeast cells. 2.5 ml of saturated culture was fixed with formaldehyde to 4% for 10 min. Cells were suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate with 10 mm ethanolamine for 10 min, washed once, and suspended in 500 μl of 0.1 m potassium phosphate. Rhodamine-phalloidin (Sigma) was incubated to a concentration of.1 μg/ml for 1 h at 25 °C. Cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, suspended in 20 μl of 2% polylysine, and mounted onto a slide. Cells were viewed under a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped for epifluorescence microscopy or confocal microscopy and photographed with Kodak Ektachrome II 400 film. CAP was isolated two ways, first as an adenylyl cyclase-binding protein and second in genetic screens for mutations that suppress the activated Ras2Val19 allele (14Field J. Vojtek A. Ballester R. Bolger G. Colicelli J. Ferguson K. Gerst J. Kataoka T. Michaeli T. Powers S. Riggs M. Rodgers L. Wieland I. Wheland B. Wigler M.

Cell. 1990; 61: 329-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). To determine the mutations in the original isolates, we polymerase chain reaction amplified DNA from the two alleles, which we will refer to as the SupC and Srv2 alleles, and sequenced the products. We found that the SupC allele had a Thr for Arg substitution at amino acid 19 (R19T) and the Srv2 allele had a substitution of Pro for Leu at amino acid 16 (L16P) (Fig. 1). These were the only mutations found in the gene, and the same mutations were found in multiple independent reactions, so they were not introduced during the amplification. Both of these mutations were near the previously identified adenylyl cyclase-binding site, suggesting that they attenuated Ras signaling by interfering with adenylyl cyclase binding. Characterization of the mutants for cAMP signaling is discussed below. To further characterize them, we performed immunofluorescence to determine the subcellular localization of the mutant proteins. Wild type CAP localizes to cytoskeletal structures known as cortical actin patches. These are small patches rich in actin filaments and actin cytoskeleton proteins. They are identified with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin, a fluorescent compound that binds actin filaments but not monomers. We found that in both the SupC and Srv2 strains CAP did not localize correctly but instead showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization, whereas more than 50% of CAP in wild type cells localized to actin cortical patches (data not shown). To demonstrate that the observed phenotypes were caused by the sequence variations in CAP and were not caused by strain differences, we reconstructed the mutations in expression plasmids and tested them incap knockout yeast. We first developed a GFP fusion protein system to rapidly determine the subcellular localization of CAP (43Chalfie M. Tu Y. Euskirchen G. Ward W.W. Prasher D.C. Science. 1994; 263: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (5409) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). We used a mutant GFP, S65T, because it fluoresces about five times more brightly than wild type GFP (37Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). All plasmids utilized the galactose-inducible promoter, Gal1, 10. Because the results above suggested that mutations in the N terminus may affect localization, we fused GFP to the C terminus. Several plasmids representing known CAP mutants were constructed to validate that the GFP reporter correctly targeted CAP; they were Δ12, Δ14, and ΔP2 (Fig. 2). Plasmid Δ12 deletes the actin-binding domain, whereas plasmid Δ14 has a longer truncation that removes the P2 site in addition to the actin-binding domain. Plasmid ΔP2 specifically substitutes alanines for prolines at amino acids 355 and 358, two positions critical for SH3 binding and localization. We confirmed expression by preparing extracts from cells and then performing Western blots with an anti-CAP antiserum. We observed bands reacting with CAP antibodies when cells were grown on galactose but not when grown on glucose. All plasmids were tested for suppression of CAP mutations. As expected, Δ12 and Δ14, which had deletions in the actin-binding domain failed to bind actin and because of this failed to grow on rich medium. Thus, the fusion proteins behaved as predicted from earlier mutational studies. We found that the proteins also localized as expected; full-length protein localized preferentially to actin cortical patches, deletion of the actin-binding domain did not effect localization (Δ12), and deletion of the P2 region (Δ14 and ΔP2) prevented correct localization. After we established the GFP system, we tested localization of the N-terminal mutants. At this time we also constructed L27F using site-specific mutagenesis to change Leu-27, an amino acid conserved in the mammalian homologs, to Phe. The L27F, R19T, and L16P fusions all restored growth on rich medium when expressed in a capstrain (data not shown). The N-terminal mutants were also constructed alone and together with the ΔP2 mutation, because this site is required for subcellular targeting to actin cortical patches. We found that each of the three N-terminal mutations, R19T, L16P, and L27F, failed to localize correctly (Fig. 2). Double mutants with the P2 site and each of the three N-terminal mutations also failed to localize to cortical actin patches (data not shown). Thus, the GFP fusions confirmed that a new targeting region is located in the N terminus of CAP. The discovery that the adenylyl cyclase-binding region of CAP was required for cytoskeletal localization prompted us to determine whether CAP localization to the actin cytoskeleton was required for cAMP signaling. To do this we introduced the CAP mutants into cap yeast and measured cAMP signaling three different ways. First we used a genetic assay that reflects cAMP levels (Fig.3), second we measured cAMP directly in cells (Fig. 4), and third we measured binding of CAP to adenylyl cyclase (Fig.5). The genetic assay is performed by testing the sensitivity to heat shock in a RAS2Val19strain. The RAS2Val19 mutation is analogous to some activating mutations in human cancers and reduces the intrinsic GTPase activity of Ras (44Sass P. Field J. Nikawa J. Toda T. Wigler M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9303-9307Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The increase in cAMP levels causes cells to be sensitive to brief heat shock treatments at 55 °C. Mutations in CAP lower cAMP levels and cause cells to be resistant to this treatment (14Field J. Vojtek A. Ballester R. Bolger G. Colicelli J. Ferguson K. Gerst J. Kataoka T. Michaeli T. Powers S.

Cell. 1990; 61: 329-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We found that, as expected from their isolation in a genetic screen, the SupC (R19T) and Srv2 (L16P) mutants failed to restore sensitivity. The L27F mutation, like wild type CAP, was still sensitive, suggesting that it did not reduce the cAMP levels in the Ras2Val19 strain. The P2 mutation alone did not alter cAMP responses by itself, nor did it alter the responses of any of the other mutants (Fig. 3; data not shown for P2).Figure 4L16P and R19T, but not L27F and ΔP2, attenuate the glucose stimulation of cAMP levels in yeast.

Despite these similarities, the mouse and chicken αA-crystallin genes exhibit significant differences in the length and content of their promoters required to direct lens-specific expression. Lens-specific expression in cultured cells is directed by the −111/+46 region of the mouse promoter (18Chepelinsky A.B. Sommer B. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) whereas an additional 51 base pairs (−162/+44) of the chicken promoter are required for such activity (10Klement J.F.

Liss, New York1988: 205-213Google Scholar), despite the fact that it too contains the conserved −111/−18 core sequence. These differences have remained an enigma in the field of crystallin gene expression for some time.Our present analysis of the PE2 region of the mouse αA-crystallin promoter may shed light on the apparent regulatory differences that exist between the mouse and chicken αA-crystallin genes. PE2 (+24/+43) in the mouse αA-crystallin gene was initially defined as a DNase I-protected region in footprint analysis using both lens and non-lens cell nuclear extracts (13Kantorow M. Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), suggestive of a role in transcriptional regulation and interesting, given that known α-crystallin regulatory elements have been confined, to date, to the 5′-flanking region of these genes. PE2A (+25/+32) represents the 5′-half of the PE2 region (see Fig. 2) and contains sequences similar to the consensus binding sites for activator protein 1 (AP-1) (20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar), the estrogen receptor (21Klein-Hitpass L. Schropp M. Wagner U. Ryffel G.U. Cell. 1986; 46: 1053-1061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) half-site, the retinoic acid receptor (22Sucov H.M. Evans R.M. Mol. Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 169-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) half-site, and the lens-specific factor L-Maf (23Ogino H. Yasuda K. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1996; 41: 1050-1057PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), as well as the antioxidant and cAMP response elements. The coincidence of these consensus regulatory sequences is a common observation for AP-1 sites in general and makes this a potential composite regulatory site through which regulatory factors from different families may be brought into close proximity to produce novel modes of gene regulation (25Miner J.N. Diamond M.I. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the −138/−130 region of the chicken αA-crystallin promoter has previously (16Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Bresnick E.H. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7363-7376Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) been shown to bind CREB/CREM proteins in lens cells, to be required for lens-specific promoter activity, and to bind AP-1 and repress expression in fibroblasts. In contrast, the analogous region of the mouse promoter differs considerably from that of the chicken AP-1 region. However, an AP-1 consensus site does exist within the downstream PE2A region of the mouse promoter, and its similarity to the chicken −138/−130 region is intriguing. The mouse PE2A and chicken −138/−130 regions share some sequence similarity, and both lie outside the conserved −111/−18 core sequence. These similarities suggested to us that the mouse and chicken αA-crystallin genes may achieve lens-specific expression through the utilization of similar regulatory elements, albeit in different locations. We provide evidence here for a functional role of the PE2A region in mouse αA-crystallin gene expression.Figure 2Sequence of the mouse αA-crystallin +20/+46 region. PE2, a previously (13Kantorow M.

As previously shown, the wild type promoter of pαA111aCAT was active in transfected SV40 T-antigen transformed mouse αTN4-1 (12Nakamura T. Donovan D.M. Hamada K. Sax C.M. Norman B. Flanagan J.R.

Biol. 1987; 7: 1807-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but not in the non-lens mouse L929 fibroblast or human Hep G2 hepatoma cell lines. When the +26/+31 region was deleted (pCS93), CAT activity was reduced in transfected αTN4-1, N/N1003A, and PLE cultures to the same level as that observed for the promoterless vector (pSV0CAT). These results suggest that the +26/+31 region is functionally important for mouse αA-crystallin promoter activity. Deletion of the +26/+31 region did not activate the −111/+46 promoter in transfected L929 or Hep G2 cells, indicating that a non-lens cell repressor element does not exist at this site. Similarly, site-directed mutagenesis (M9, AtctgC; M10, ctcGag) of the −138/−130 CREB/CREM/AP-1 binding site (ACTGTC) of the chicken αA-crystallin gene eliminated promoter activity in transfected lens cultures (PLE) and did not activate the promoter in transfected primary chicken embryonic fibroblasts (Fig. 3 B and Ref. 16Cvekl A.

Open table in a new tab Given the coincidence of consensus AP-1 and steroid receptor (estrogen receptor/H, retinoic acid receptor) sites, a series of transfections was performed to determine the potential involvement of these two distinct regulatory pathways acting through the PE2A region. AP-1 has been shown to mediate enhanced transcription by binding to TPA response elements (TRE/AP-1 sites) in DNA in the presence of tumor-inducing phorbol esters, which activate the protein kinase C pathway of signal transduction (20Lee W. Mitchell P. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 49: 741-752Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar, 34Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2148) Google Scholar). Dexamethasone, on the other hand, mimics the action of steroid hormones and modulates gene expression through the steroid receptor pathway (25Miner J.N. Diamond M.I. Yamamoto K.R. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 525-530PubMed Google Scholar). pαA111aCAT and pCS93 were transfected into αTN4-1, L929, and Hep G2 cells, and the cells were subsequently treated with either dexamethasone or the phorbol ester TPA (Fig. 3 C). TPA activated pαA111aCAT in transfected αTN4-1 cells but had no effect upon pCS93. In contrast, dexamethasone did not alter pαA111aCAT activity, suggesting that the steroid receptor pathway is not involved in the regulation of mouse αA-crystallin gene expression in lens cells. To confirm the role of AP-1 proteins in mouse αA-crystallin gene expression, pαA111aCAT was cotransfected with a c-Jun cDNA expression vector (RSV-c-Jun) (Fig. 3 C) (35Doucas V. Spyrou G. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2237-2245Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). In cotransfected αTN4-1 cells c-Jun stimulated pαA111aCAT, but not pCS93, activity. The only consensus AP-1 binding site within the −111/+46 region of the mouse αA-crystallin lies within the PE2A region, suggesting that the TPA- and c-Jun-induced expression was mediated through PE2A. Thus, AP-1 proteins acting within the PE2A region appear to play a role in regulating mouse αA-crystallin gene expression in lens cells. Our findings are consistent with previous EMSA studies demonstrating an increased binding of nuclear extracts to a consensus AP-1 oligo upon exposure of cultured N/N1003A lens cells and organ-cultured monkey lenses to TPA (37Frederikse P.H. Garland D. Zigler Jr., J.S. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10169-10174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The relatively low level of c-Jun-induced pαA111aCAT expression in transfected αTN4-1 cells may be because of the high level of c-Jun protein in lens cells (38Vacchiano E. Zelenka P.S. Exp.

Promoter analysis has established that αA-crystallin gene expression is controlled by the interaction of multiple regulatory elements (8Chepelinsky A.B. King C.R. Zelenka P.S. Piatigorsky J. Proc.

In contrast, pαA111aCAT activity was not altered by TPA treatment or c-Jun expression in L929 or Hep G2 cells (Fig. 3 C). These findings suggest that c-Jun itself is not sufficient to activate the mouse αA-crystallin promoter and that additional factors required for gene expression are present in lens cells but are not found in non-lens cells.Protein-DNA interactions occurring in the PE2 region were initially studied via EMSA using a radiolabeled oligo spanning the mouse αA-crystallin +18/+46 region (PE2 oligo) and an αTN4-1 nuclear extract, in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitor oligos (Fig. 4). Incubation of the radiolabeled PE2 oligo with the αTN4-1 nuclear extract produced one major complex (C1). The formation of complex C1 was completely inhibited by the presence of a 100-fold molar excess of the unlabeled PE2 oligo (PE2) but not by the presence of an oligo in which the +26/+31 region had been deleted (dPE2). In addition, there was no competition by a nonspecific oligo or by oligos for upstream αA-crystallin regulatory sites (data not shown). EMSA, employing a series of 16 unlabeled competitor oligos that carried double point mutations spanning the +18/+34 region, indicated that complex C1 was produced by nuclear proteins binding to the +25/+32 region, which coincides with the AP-1 consensus binding sequence. The existence of this site is indicated by the reduced ability of mutant oligos 8–15 to compete for complex formation. A minor lower migrating complex (C2) was occasionally observed at varying intensities and may represent an adjacent downstream protein binding site (data not shown).Figure 4Analysis of protein-DNA interactions occurring within the mouse αA-crystallin PE2 region. EMSA reactions were carried out using a radiolabeled oligo spanning the +18/+46 region of the mouse αA-crystallin gene and an αTN4-1 nuclear extract. In some cases a 100-fold molar excess of one of the following unlabeled competitor oligos was included: a wild type +18/+46 oligo (PE2), an oligo containing a deletion of the +26/+31 region (dPE2, deleted bases denoted by a dash), or a series of 16 +18/+46 oligos containing successive 2-base pair substitutions (denoted by lowercase letters; wild type bases denoted by adot) spanning the +18/+34 region. C1 denotes the major complex formed, whereas C2 denotes an occasionally observed minor complex (data not shown).

The αTN4-1 nuclear extract was incubated with either the PE2 oligo or an oligo known to bind AP-1 (derived from the rat collagenase gene) (42Chiu R. Angel P. Karin M. Cell. 1989; 59: 979-986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). In the presence of the αTN4-1 nuclear extract, the PE2 oligo (Fig.5 A, lanes 1–2) and consensus AP-1-binding oligo (Fig. 5 A, lanes 3–4) exhibited the same mobility, suggesting that they bind the same proteins. Furthermore, EMSA performed in the presence of an anti-c-Jun antibody inhibited C1 complex formation (Fig. 5 B,lane 4), whereas a negative control antibody directed against NF-κB did not affect C1 formation (Fig. 5 B,lane 3). In addition, similar-sized PE2 and AP-1 oligo-based complexes were formed upon incubation with purified human c-Jun (data not shown). Further experiments are required to determine whether additional members of the AP-1 family of proteins also contribute to C1 complex formation as a result of heterodimer binding to the PE2A region.Figure 5Analysis of AP-1 binding to the PE2A region.

C1and C2 are as described in the legend to Fig. 4.B, EMSAs were carried out using an αTN4-1 nuclear extract and the radiolabeled mouse αA-crystallin +18/+46 oligo in the presence of either an anti-c-Jun (lane 4) or anti-NF-κB (lane 3, negative control) antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)DISCUSSIONLens-preferred expression of the mouse αA-crystallin gene is achieved, at least in part, by the use of multiple transcriptional regulatory elements residing in its 5′-flanking region (5Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1994; 69: 155-201PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we provide both in vivo functional and in vitroprotein binding evidence implicating PE2A (+26/+31) and the AP-1 family of transcription factors in the regulation of mouse αA-crystallin gene expression. These findings are consistent with the high degree of sequence similarity exhibited between PE2A and the AP-1 consensus binding site, as well as previous observations that PE2A is protected in footprint assays using both lens (αTN4-1) and non-lens cell nuclear extracts (13Kantorow M. Cvekl A. Sax C.M. Piatigorsky J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Regulation by AP-1 proteins is a common thread that unifies the diverse population of crystallin genes in several different species and has been implicated in the regulation of the βA3/A1-, βB1-, γB-, γF-, and S-crystallin genes of chicken, human, rat, and squid (36Tomarev S.I.

Chem. 1992; 267: 4277-4280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that one possible mechanism for the recruitment of lens crystallin genes was selective pressure applied at the level of the transcription factors that function optimally in the lens. AP-1-mediated regulation may have been one such selective feature during evolution that contributed to crystallin gene recruitment, because the DNA binding or trans-activating capacity of these proteins is affected by the redox state of the cell (47Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 48Walker L.J. Robson C.N. Black E. Gillespie D. Hickson I.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5370-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). This feature is of special importance in ocular tissues routinely subjected to high levels of UV-induced oxidative stress and specifically in the lens that is prone to cataract formation as a result of oxidative stress (49Spector A.

The carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide (FTSL) is required for polarized surface expression. The ability of this tetrapeptide to serve as an autonomous sorting signal has been analyzed by adding this sequence motif to the C terminus of an apical membrane protein, the influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA). The recombinant protein HA-FTSL retained the apical localization of the parental HA protein. Substitution of the complete cytoplasmic tail of MCP for the cytoplasmic tail of HA resulted in the targeting of the chimeric protein (HA/MCP) to the basolateral surface suggesting that the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif is a weak sorting signal that requires additional targeting information from the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of MCP for redirecting an apical protein to the basolateral membrane domain. In contrast to the native HA, the HA-FTSL protein was subject to endocytosis. The basolateral HA/MCP was also found to be internalized and thus differed from the basolateral MCP. This result suggests that the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif serves as an internalization signal and that in native MCP sorting information outside the cytoplasmic tail counteracts this endocytosis signal. Substitution of a tyrosine for the phenylalanine dramatically increased the internalization with most of the HA-YTSL protein being present intracellularly. Our results are consistent with the view that the interplay of multiple sorting signals and the modification of a well known targeting signal (YTSL) by amino acid exchange (FTSL) determine the constitutive expression of MCP on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells.

To meet these requirements, they have a polarized organization that involves the separation of the plasma membrane into an apical and a basolateral portion (reviewed in Ref. 1Tucker S.P. Compans R.W. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 187-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The two membrane domains have a different protein and lipid composition, which is maintained by a diffusion barrier made up from junctional complexes. A specialized sorting apparatus exists to ensure that proteins and lipids specific for either of the two surface domains are targeted correctly. As far as sorting signals are concerned, more information is available for basolateral proteins than is for apical proteins. Sequence motifs for basolateral targeting are usually located in the cytoplasmic tail and often contain a tyrosine residue (2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 3Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported a close relationship between basolateral sorting signals and determinants for coated pit localization (3Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 4Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Indeed the majority of basolateral proteins that have been identified so far and characterized in more detail are subject to endocytosis. An exception is membrane cofactor protein (MCP),1 which is not endocytosed though it is efficiently targeted to the basolateral plasma membrane of several polarized epithelial cells (5Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Maisner A. Zimmer G.

MCP is a widely distributed regulatory protein that interacts with complement factors C3b and C4b deposited on self-tissue (7Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). It promotes the degradation of these factors by plasma serine protease factor I and thus protects the cell from complement-mediated damage. It also serves as a receptor for vaccine strains of measles virus (8Naniche D. Varior-Krishnan G. Cervoni F. Wild T.F. Rossi B. Rabourdin-Combe C. Gerlier D. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 6025-6032Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Dörig R.E. Marcil A. Chopra A. Richardson C.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 295-305Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). The binding sites for the complement factors as well as for measles virus are located within four cysteine-rich repeating domains at the NH2 terminus of this type I membrane protein (10Manchester M. Valsamakis A. Kaufman R. Liszewski M.K. Alvarez J. Atkinson J.P. Lublin D.M. Oldstone M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 11Iwata K.

The cytoplasmic portion of MCP consists of 10 membrane-proximal, predominantly basic amino acids designated as intracytoplasmic anchor that is followed by a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. The latter domain is subject to alternative splicing resulting in isoforms with two different tails, a shorter one comprising 16 amino acids and a longer one comprising 23 amino acids (reviewed in Ref. 7Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1992; 178: 45-60PubMed Google Scholar). Though the two different cytoplasmic tails found in MCP isoforms do not show any sequence similarity, they both contain sequence motifs for basolateral targeting of MCP (5Maisner A. Liszewski M.K. Atkinson J.P. Schwartz-Albiez R. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18853-18858Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The sorting signal of the shorter cytoplasmic tail has been characterized in more detail and several interesting features have been revealed (6Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20793-20799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar): (i) a tetrapeptide at the very carboxyl-terminal end (-FTSL) is essential for basolateral targeting; (ii) compared with a common basolateral sorting signal (Tyr-Xaa-Xaa-aliphatic amino acid), a phenylalanine is substituted for the tyrosine; (iii) MCP containing the FTSL sequence is not endocytosed; (iv) substitution of a tyrosine residue (-YTSL) results in efficient internalization. By providing sorting information and by avoiding endocytosis, the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide ensures constitutive expression of MCP on the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. In this way, MCP is continuously present on the membrane domain that faces the serosal compartment and therefore is able to protect the epithelial cell from complement-mediated lysis. From the biological point of view, it is interesting to know whether the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptides (FTSL and YTSL) are functional only in the context of MCP or whether they are also active in the sorting of other membrane proteins. Therefore, the tetrapeptide sequences were added to the carboxyl terminus of the hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A virus, and the recombinant proteins were analyzed for surface transport in epithelial cells as well as for endocytosis. MDCK cells (strain I) were grown in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg streptomycin. Tissue culture-treated 0.4-μm pore size Transwell polycarbonate filters (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) were used for all experiments. Cells were seeded 5 days before experiments (2 × 105 cells per 7.5-mm unit and 2 × 106 cells per 24-mm unit). The polarity was determined by measurement of the transepithelial resistance using a Millipore ERS apparatus (Bedford, MA). MDCK cells formed a tight monolayer with an electrical resistance of 1,000–2,500 Ω·cm2. The different patterns of surface proteins on the apical and basolateral membrane of the polarized cell lines were verified by surface biotinylation. For recombinant DNA techniques, plasmid pSG5new was used. Cloning of the HA gene of fowl plague virus (influenza A/FPV/Rostock/34) into this vector (pSG5new:HA) has been reported previously (12Schäfer W. Stroh A. Berghöfer S. Seiler J. Vey M. Kruse M.L.

Atkinson JP. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10776-10779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by EcoRI and cloned into theEcoRI site of pSG5new. Chimeras were generated by a recombinant polymerase chain reaction technique (15Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar) using synthetic oligonucleotides and pSG5new:HA and pSG5new:MCP-BC1 as templates. The sequences of the chimeric constructs were confirmed by the dideoxy chain termination method, using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin Elmer). For stable expression, MDCK cells were cotransfected with either of the pSG5new plasmids, and the neomycin resistance-conferring plasmid pIGI at a ratio of 10:1 using the calcium phosphate method. Cells were screened for geneticin resistance by addition of 1.0 mg of geneticin (Sigma) per ml of medium. The selected cell clones were screened for expression of foreign proteins by immunofluorescence. Filter-grown MDCK cells were washed three times with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2. The apical or the basolateral cell surface was incubated twice for 20 min at 4 °C with 0.5 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin (Pierce) by adding 1 ml of the biotinylating reagent to the respective filter chamber. The same volume of PBS containing 0.1 m glycine was placed into the opposite filter chamber. After biotinylation, cells were washed once with cold PBS containing 0.1 m glycine and three times with cold PBS. Cells were lysed in 0.75 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 0.14 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5) followed by centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibodies J4/48 (Dianova) directed against MCP (final dilution of 1:100) or 2A11-H7 (final dilution of 1:200) directed against the H7 subtype of the influenza A hemagglutinin (kindly provided by Wolfgang Garten). After addition of 40 μl of a suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Sigma), immunocomplexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer and suspended in nonreducing sample buffer for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Following separation on a 10% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions, proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose using a modified semidry Western blot method as described previously (16Schultze B. Gross H.J. Brossmer R. Herrler G. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6232-6237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After blocking nonspecific binding sites by 10% nonfat dry milk in PBS, blots were incubated for 45 min at 4 °C with streptavidin-biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. Biotinylated proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by exposure to an autoradiography film (Kodak XAR). For confocal immunofluorescence, MDCK cell clones grown on 7.5-mm Transwell units were fixed on ice with 2% paraformaldehyde (15 min). The apical and basolateral surfaces were incubated with PBS containing 3% BSA and either of the monoclonal antibodies J4/48 and 2A11-H7 at a dilution of 1:10 for 2 h at 37 °C, washed three times with cold PBS, and subsequently incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Denmark) as described previously. The samples were washed with PBS and mounted in Mowiol (Hoechst) and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane (Sigma). The fluorescence label was visualized with a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM Carl Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany) working with the blue line of an argon laser (408 nm). Oil immersion planneofluar lenses were used for confocal epifluorescence and/or Nomarski differential interference contrast. MDCK cells stably expressing either of the chimeric proteins were grown on coverslips. At 10–50% confluency, surface-expressed protein was labeled with the H7-specific mAb 2A11-H7 diluted 1:50 in PBS-BSA. After an incubation for 60 min on ice, the antibody was removed by washing with PBS, and the cells were incubated with cell culture medium for 60 min either at 4 or 37 °C to allow endocytosis of the antigen-antibody complex. Internalization was stopped by rapid cooling on ice. Surface-bound antibody was detected by an incubation for 60 min on ice with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse Fab fragments (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:100 in PBS-BSA. After washing with PBS, the cells were fixed and permeabilized for 5 min at −20 °C with methanol/acetone (1:1). Internalized antibodies were detected with FITC-labeled rabbit anti-mouse IgG (DAKO, Denmark) at a dilution of 1:500 in PBS-BSA. To avoid nonspecific binding to the rhodamine-labeled goat Fab fragments bound to the cell surface, the FITC-labeled antiserum was preabsorbed with goat-IgG-agarose (Sigma). After the double immunofluorescence staining, the samples were mounted in Mowiol and 10% 1,4-diazabicyclo(2,2,2)octane. Conventional epifluorescence was performed with an Axiophot microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochem, Germany). Pictures were taken with Kodak Tmax film (3200 ASA) exposed for identical times for both fluorochromes. To know whether the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of MCP functions as an autonomous sorting signal, we wanted to determine whether it is able to redirect an apical membrane protein to the basolateral membrane domain of polarized epithelial cells. For our analysis, we chose the HA protein of influenza A virus (strain FPV). The apical localization of this protein on epithelial cells is well documented (17Boulan E.R. Sabatini D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 5071-5075Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown to be excluded from coated pits (18Lazarovits J. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Wang R.H. Fire E. Bird C. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, foreign sequences introduced into the HA protein can be analyzed not only for basolateral targeting information but also for their ability to mediate endocytosis through coated pits. The chimeric proteins used in our study are shown in Fig.1. In the HA/MCP chimera, the 11 amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of the HA protein were replaced with the 26 amino acids of the cytoplasmic portion of MCP (isoform 1). In the HA-FTSL chimera, the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide of MCP (Phe-Thr-Ser-Leu) was added to the carboxyl terminus of HA. In the HA-YTSL and HA-ATSL chimeras, the phenylalanine residue of HA-FTSL was replaced with a tyrosine or an alanine, respectively. Initial experiments had shown that it is difficult to generate stable MDCK cell lines constitutively expressing the wild type hemagglutinin of fowl plague virus. We reasoned that the pH sensitivity of the HA protein may be responsible for these difficulties. To be fusion-active, the influenza HA has to be proteolytically cleaved into the subunits HA1 and HA2. Following cleavage, a conformational change is induced if the HA protein encounters an acidic environment. If this structural rearrangement occurs while the membrane-bound HA, via its sialic acid binding activity, has close contact to another membrane, fusion of the two membranes is induced. If the conformational change occurs when the viral protein is not bound to a receptor of another membrane, the HA becomes irreversibly inactivated. In the case of FPV, cleavage of HA occurs by furin at thetrans-Golgi network. The low pH of this compartment inactivates the viral protein. In the case of an FPV infection, another influenza A protein, M2, that functions as a ion channel prevents the inactivation by abolishing the pH gradient between the Golgi and the cytoplasm. To avoid these problems we used a mutant HA in which the furin cleavage site (Arg-Xaa-Lys/Arg-Arg↓) was abolished by site-directed mutagenesis. The KKRKKR sequence of the wild type protein was changed in the mutant protein to KKRNRK. After introduction of these mutations, it was possible to generate stable MDCK cells expressing the HA protein. As shown in Fig.2, the mutant protein is present in the uncleaved form, even 4 h after synthesis. Like the hemagglutinin of human influenza viruses, addition of trypsin results in the cleavage of the HA protein present on the cell surface into the subunits HA1 and HA2. The mutant HA protein was used for the chimeric proteins mentioned above. MDCK cells stably expressing either of the chimeric proteins were analyzed whether they express the foreign protein on the cell surface. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with paraformaldehyde, and surface expression was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using a monoclonal antibody (2A11-H7) directed to the HA protein of FPV. As shown in Fig.3, the chimeric proteins HA/MCP, HA-ATSL, and HA-FTSL were found on the surface of the recombinant MDCK cells as was the parental HA protein. No surface expression was detected with the HA-YTSL protein (not shown). Permeabilization of the cells by saponin indicated that this protein was present intracellularly (Fig.3, panel f). The pattern of fluorescence suggests that this protein is present in vesicular structures as is observed with proteins that are internalized by endocytosis. The surface-expressed chimeric proteins were analyzed whether they are present on the apical or on the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. For this purpose, the cells were cultured on filters. Polarized cell monolayers were cooled to 4 °C and either the apical or the basolateral surface proteins were labeled by adding the nonmembrane-permeating reagent sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide-biotin to the respective filter chamber. Following immunoprecipitation with mAb 2A11-H7, the proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and biotinylated proteins were detected with streptavidin-peroxidase. As shown in Fig. 4, the HA protein as well as the chimeric proteins HA-FTSL and HA-ATSL were found predominantly on the apical surface of MDCK cells. In contrast, strong labeling of the HA/MCP protein was detectable only on the basolateral surface. This result indicates that the cytoplasmic portion of MCP contains sorting information that is sufficient for targeting of the HA protein to the basolateral plasma membrane. The FTSL sequence alone that is essential for the basolateral transport of MCP is not sufficient to redirect the apical HA protein to the basolateral membrane domain. To confirm these results, the distribution of the chimeric proteins on MDCK cells was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. Filter-grown MDCK cells were fixed without disruption of the plasma membrane. The fixed cells were incubated from both the apical and the basolateral side with mAb 2A11-H7 and a FITC-conjugated second antibody. A vertical section (side view) of the cells is shown in Fig. 5. Strong fluorescence signals were detected in the apical surface of MDCK cells expressing the HA protein or the chimeric proteins HA-FTSL or HA-ATSL. In contrast, the HA/MCP protein was found to be localized predominantly in the basolateral portion of the plasma membrane. Thus, the confocal immunofluorescence analysis confirmed the result that the cytoplasmic tail of MCP but not the FTSL sequence alone is able to redirect the influenza hemagglutinin to the basolateral surface of polarized MDCK cells.Figure 4Apical/basolateral distribution of the chimeric and mutant proteins on the surface of MDCK cells. MDCK cells stably expressing MCP, HA, HA/MCP, HA-FTSL, or HA-ATSL, respectively, were grown on filters and surface-biotinylated from either the apical (a) or the basolateral (b) side. After cell lysis, proteins were immunoprecipitated with an HA-specific or an MCP-specific monoclonal antibody. Precipitates were analyzed by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy of chimeric and mutant proteins.

Confocal immunofluorescence micrographs of the vertical profile (side view) through the monolayers are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) MCP is a basolateral protein that is not endocytosed (6Maisner A.

The HA protein is an apical protein that is excluded from coated pit localization (18Lazarovits J. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Wang R.H. Fire E. Bird C. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was of interest whether the chimeric proteins were also refractory to internalization. In addition, we wanted to find out whether the poor surface expression of the HA-YTSL mutant was due to endocytosis. To examine this possibility, we analyzed the chimeric proteins for endocytosis by an antibody uptake experiment. The proteins at the surface of living cells were incubated with mAb 2A11-H7 at 4 °C, and the cells were either kept on ice for 60 min or warmed to 37 °C to allow endocytosis to occur. Surface-bound antibodies were detected by incubation of the living cells with a rhodamine-conjugated second antibody at 4 °C. After permeabilization of the cells, internalized protein-antibody complexes were detected with a FITC-conjugated second antibody. With cells maintained at 4 °C, neither of the proteins were detected intracellularly (not shown). As shown in Fig. 6, after incubation at 37 °C, the HA-ATSL mutant was detected on the surface, but not intracellularly. With the HA-FTSL mutant, bound antibody was also detectable on the surface of MDCK cells. However, the intracellular staining revealed that a substantial amount of the protein was internalized during an incubation period of 60 min at 37 °C. Intracellular fluorescence was also observed with the HA-YTSL mutant. In contrast to HA-FTSL, the latter chimeric protein was not detectable by surface staining. This result confirms that HA-YTSL indeed is very efficiently internalized. The HA-MCP mutant resembled the HA-FTSL mutant with respect to endocytosis, i.e. fluorescence was detectable both by surface and intracellular staining. These results indicate that both the carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif and the MCP cytoplasmic tail act as internalization signals in the context of the influenza hemagglutinin, whereas MCP, the protein they are derived from, is not endocytosed. Protein transport from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells is mediated by vesicular transport involving clathrin-coated vesicles. Such vesicles are also transport intermediates for the protein traffic from the plasma membrane to endosomes (4Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). Formation of clathrin-coated vesicles requires the binding of specific assembly proteins. AP-1 is characteristic for coated pits and vesicles derived from thetrans-Golgi network, AP-2 functions in the formation of endocytotic vesicles (19Hirst J. Robinson M.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 173-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The adaptor complexes AP-1 and AP-2 promote the assembly of the clathrin cage at the respective membrane. In addition, they bind to the cytoplasmic domain of membrane proteins thus directing these proteins into the transport vesicles (2Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The interaction with the adaptor complexes is mediated by sorting signals within the cytoplasmic tail of the membrane proteins. The most common targeting signal for both basolateral transport and endocytosis is based on a tyrosine residue within the motif Y-X-X-O with O representing a large aliphatic amino acid (3Matter K. Mellman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 545-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Previous studies on the role of this tetrapeptide signals for basolateral targeting or for internalization were performed mostly with proteins that contained this sequence motif at an internal position of the cytoplasmic tail. It is established that nearby amino acids may modulate the sorting signal. In addition to the primary sequence, the secondary structure and the position within the tail have been suggested to be important factors that may control the recognition of the signal (20Höning S. Griffith J. Geuze H.J. Hunziker W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5230-5239Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Studies on the G protein of vesicular stomatitis virus have revealed that a certain separation (≥5 amino acids) between the basolateral targeting signal and the transmembrane domain is required for the motif to be functional (21Thomas D.C. Roth M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15732-15739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our work addressed the question whether the tetrapeptide signal also functions in a carboxyl-terminal position. Studies with MCP had shown that the FTSL sequence at the very carboxyl terminus is essential for the basolateral targeting of this complement-regulatory protein (6Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20793-20799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Substituting a tyrosine for the phenylalanine residue did not affect basolateral targeting. However, it resulted in efficient endocytosis. The native protein with the FTSL motif was not endocytosed at a detectable rate. This result indicated that in MCP the tetrapeptide sorting signal was modulated such that it was functional in basolateral targeting but not in endocytosis. However, it was not known whether the carboxyl-terminal FTSL sequence alone is able to convey this transport information or whether other portions of MCP contribute to the sorting signal. To obtain this information we connected the tetrapeptide with the carboxyl terminus of a type I membrane protein that normally is located on the apical surface. Addition of the FTSL sequence to the carboxyl-terminal end of the influenza hemagglutinin did not result in redirecting this apical protein to the basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. This observation together with our previous finding that deletion of the FTSL motif in MCP results in a nonpolarized distribution of the mutant MCP (6Maisner A. Zimmer G. Liszewski M.K. Lublin D.M. Atkinson J.P. Herrler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20793-20799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) indicate that this tetrapeptide is only a weak basolateral targeting signal. It is sufficient for the basolateral localization of an otherwise nonpolarized membrane protein but not for the basolateral transport of an apical protein. Substitution of the complete cytoplasmic tail of MCP for the cytoplasmic domain of the HA protein resulted in the polarized expression of the chimeric protein (HA/MCP) on the basolateral surface. Therefore, amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail different from the FTSL sequence also contain basolateral targeting information. Whether this information is contained in a sequence motif or in the secondary structure is not known. In connection with the FTSL motif, it creates a strong basolateral targeting signal that is sufficient to redirect an apical protein to the basolateral surface. Though the FTSL motif was unable to convey basolateral sorting information onto the HA protein, it affected its internalization. Although the native hemagglutinin is not endocytosed, the chimeric protein (HA-FTSL) was subject to endocytosis. Information residing in the transmembrane domain has been shown to exclude the native HA protein from the incorporation into coated pits (18Lazarovits J. Naim H.Y. Rodriguez A.C. Wang R.H. Fire E. Bird C. Henis Y.I. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 339-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal FTSL motif is strong enough to override this negative transport signal. This finding makes the HA-FTSL protein an interesting model protein to analyze the interaction of an apical membrane protein with adaptor complex proteins involved the formation of clathrin-coated pits and endocytosis. As expected substitution of a tyrosine residue for the phenylalanine created an even stronger endocytosis signal. In fact, internalization of this chimeric protein was so efficient that we were unable to detect it by surface staining. Internalization from the apical side is usually less efficient than endocytosis from the basolateral membrane domain. A reason for this difference has been shown to be the slower maturation of coated pits at the apical surface (22Naim H.Y. Dodds D.T. Brewer C.B. Roth M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1241-1250Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). From the efficient internalization, we conclude that the HA-YTSL mutant is transported to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells. With respect to the question whether a tetrapeptide sorting signal at the carboxyl-terminal position of an apical protein is functional in basolateral transport and endocytosis, the answer is positive as far as the internalization process is concerned. Basolateral targeting is only achieved with a strong (-YTSL) but not with a weak (-FTSL) signal. Interestingly the HA/MCP chimera that was transported to the basolateral surface of MDCK cells was also endocytosed. Thus, substitution of the cytoplasmic tail of a protein that is not endocytosed (MCP) for the cytoplasmic domain of another protein that is not endocytosed (HA) resulted in a chimeric protein that is internalized. This finding can be explained by assuming that the FTSL motif in the HA/MCP protein acts as an internalization signal as it does in the HA-FTSL protein. The resistance of native MCP to endocytotic uptake then implies that this protein contains transport information outside the cytoplasmic tail that counteracts the FTSL signal and thus prevents endocytosis. This view is supported by the finding that the YTSL motif was a stronger internalization signal in the context of the HA protein than it was in MCP. Although HA-YTSL could not be detected by surface staining, MCP-YTSL was readily detectable on the surface of MDCK cells. The signal of MCP that counteracts endocytosis might reside either in the transmembrane domain or in the ectodomain being a linear sequence motif or an element of the secondary structure. Taken together, our results are consistent with the view that more than one sorting signal is contained in MCP. Apart from the carboxyl-terminal tetrapeptide there is sequence information in the membrane-proximal part promoting basolateral targeting. In addition there is sorting information outside the cytoplasmic tail preventing endocytosis. Multiple sorting signals have also been reported for other proteins. For example, the 46-kDa mannose 6-phosphate receptor has been shown to contain a common binding site for adaptors AP-1 and AP-2 and two separate binding sites for AP-1 and AP-2, respectively (23Höning S. Sosa M. Hille-Rehfeld A. von Figura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19884-19890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Though basolateral targeting and internalization signals partly overlap, the combination of multiple signals and the modulation of individual signals (e.g. FTSL versus YTSL) allows to direct a protein to a defined location, i.e. in the case of MCP it allows the constitutive expression at the basolateral surface of polarized epithelial cells. We are thankful to Wolfgang Garten for providing monoclonal antibodies and the cloned HA gene."

Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16O'Grady P. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21033-21037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Its potential substrates are likely to be cytoplasmic proteins or the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins. To discern the substrate specificity of TβR-V, we studied nonphysiological substrates such as caseins and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3, and we recently identified the consensus substrate motif (S XE/S(P)/D) of TβR-V in these substrates (14Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar,15Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The elucidation of the consensus substrate motif enabled us to search for potential physiological substrates possessing theS XE/S(P)/D motif. The many candidate proteins include the mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II (Man-6-P/IGF-II) receptor. This receptor appears especially interesting to examine for its substrate activity because of the following reasons. 1) The cytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor actually contains two consensus substrate motif sequences that are highly conserved among species (DSEDE and DSDED) (17Morgan D.O. Edman J.C. Standring D.N. Fried V.A. Smith M.C. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1987; 329: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 18Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M.

This evolutionary conservation suggests the importance of these sequences in the function of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor molecule. 2) The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor has already been shown to be an in vitro substrate for casein kinase II (21Rosorius O. Issinger O.-G. Braulke T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21470-21473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mérese S. Ludwig T. Frank R. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18833-18842PubMed Google Scholar), the consensus sequence of which (S XXE) is similar to that of TβR-V (S XE/S(P)/D) (15Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Pearson P.B. Kemp B.E. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 62-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Conceivably, TβR-V and casein kinase II could recognize either or both of the putative phosphorylation sites (DSEDE and DSDED) in the cytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (17Morgan D.O. Edman J.C. Standring D.N. Fried V.A. Smith M.C. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1987; 329: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar, 18Lobel P. Dahms N.M. Breitmeyer J. Chirgwin J.M.

A. 1995; 92: 9762-9766Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 3) The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor has been shown to be involved in the presentation of latent TGF-β on the cell surface for proteolytic activation (24Sato Y. Tsuboi R. Lyons R. Moses H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 580-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). It seemed possible that TβR-V might regulate the function of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor via phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor. The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor is a multifunctional 270-kDa transmembrane receptor that binds lysosomal enzymes and mannose 6-phosphate (Man-6-P)-containing proteins and also binds IGF-II (26Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 27Kornfeld S. Annu. Rev.

McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2495-2508Google Scholar). At steady state, the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor is predominantly present in endosomes/prelysosomal compartments and in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Only a small fraction of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor is present on the cell surface. This cell-surface Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor undergoes constitutive internalization and recycling. It is involved in the uptake of lysosomal enzymes, of IGF-II from the extracellular compartment, and also in the cell-surface activation of latent TGF-β (24Sato Y. Tsuboi R. Lyons R. Moses H. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 757-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar, 25Dennis P.A. Rifkin D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To test the kinase activity of TβR-V on the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor, we investigated the phosphorylation of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor by purified TβR-V, and we also examined the effect of TGF-β on the phosphorylation and function of cell-surface Man-6-P/IGF-II receptors in cultured cells. In this communication, we demonstrate that the bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor is phosphorylated at serine residues by TβR-V purified from bovine liver plasma membranes. However, the truncated receptor that lacks the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail (soluble Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor) is not phosphorylated. We also show that TGF-β stimulates serine-specific phosphorylation of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor in [32P]ortho- phosphate metabolically labeled cells. The in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation appears to occur at the putative phosphorylation sites. Furthermore, we show that TGF-β stimulates the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated uptake of exogenous β-glucuronidase in wild-type mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) and in TβR-II-defective mutant cells (DR26 cells) but not in TβR-I-defective mutant cells (R-1B cells) nor in human colorectal carcinoma cells (RII-37 cells) that express TβR-I and TβR-II but lack TβR-V. [32P]Orthophosphate (∼400–800 mCi/ml), [γ-32P]ATP (4, 500 Ci/mmol), Na125I (17 Ci/mg), and Trans35S-label (1,180 Ci/mmol) were purchased from ICN Biochemicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). High molecular mass protein standards (myosin, 205 kDa; β-galactosidase, 116 kDa; phosphorylase, 97 kDa; bovine serum albumin, 66 kDa) and other chemical reagents were obtained from Sigma. Fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Cappel Laboratories (Melvern, PA). 4-Methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) β-d-glucuronide was obtained from Research Products International (Elk Grove, IL). TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were purchased from Austral Biologicals (San Ramon, CA) and R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. TGF-β1 was used in all experiments requiring TGF-β except the affinity labeling of Lmpr+ and Lmpr− cells where 125I-labeled TGF-β1 and TGF-β3 were used. Both bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor and its cytoplasmic tail- and transmembrane-truncated form (soluble Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor) were provided by Dr. Peter Lobel, Center of Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine, Piscataway, NJ. Recombinant human β-glucuronidase and rabbit antisera to human β-glucuronidase and bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor were prepared as described previously (30Oshima A. Kyle J.W. Miller R.D. Hoffman J.W. Powell P.P. Grubb J.H. Sly W.S. Tropak M. Guise K.S. Gravel R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 83: 8447-8451Google Scholar, 31Creek K.E. Sly W.S. Biochem.

Disuccinimidyl suberate was obtained from Pierce. Mouse L cells stably transfected with neo vector only and with vector expressing human Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor cDNA (Lmpr− and Lmpr+ cells) were prepared as described previously (32Nolan C.M. Kyle J.W. Watanabe H. Sly W.S. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 197-213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human colorectal carcinoma cells transfected with neo vector only and with vector expressing TβR-II cDNA (HCT-116 Neo and RII-37 cells) were provided by Dr. Michael G. Brattain, Medical College of Ohio. Wild-type mink lung epithelial cells (Mv1Lu cells) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). TβR-I- and TβR-II-defective mutants (R-1B and DR 26 cells) were provided by Dr. Joan Massagué, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. All other cell types were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum. The TβR-V was purified from bovine liver plasma membranes by sequential column chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B, DEAE-cellulose, and Sepharose CL-4B following Triton X-100 extraction of liver plasma membranes according to the procedure of O'Grady et al. (8O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified TβR-V showed the homogeneity of an ∼400-kDa protein band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and silver staining (8O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, some preparations of purified TβR-V were found to contain proteolytic products of molecular weights ∼100,000–130,000. The reaction mixture (50 μl volume) contained ∼0.25 μg of TβR-V purified from bovine liver plasma membranes, various concentrations of bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor, or 100 nmsoluble bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor, in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 3.3% glycerol, 0.08% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmMnCl2, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. The phosphorylation reaction was started by addition of 5 μCi/5 μm[γ-32P]ATP. After 20 min at 0 °C, the reaction mixture was analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and autoradiography. The 32P-labeled Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor band which co-migrated with its protein band was excised from the dried gels and subjected to phosphoamino acid analysis as described previously (16O'Grady P. Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21033-21037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 60-mm Petri dishes in DMEM containing 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 3.2 μm methotrexate (for Lmpr− and Lmpr+ cells) or 10% fetal calf serum (for Mv1Lu, R-1B, DR26, RII-37, and NIH 3T3 cells). The cells were then metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate as described previously (33Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12608-12618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled Lmpr+ and Lmpr− cells were then incubated with 0.1 nm TGF-β in the presence of 16 μm okadaic acid and 100 μm vanadate. After 30 min at 0 °C, the cells were then lysed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer according to the procedure of Liu et al. (14Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The supernatant of the cell lysates was incubated with antiserum to Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (1:100 dilution). The immunocomplexes were precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose gel (50%, v/v). After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer, the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and autoradiography. [32P]Orthophosphate metabolically labeled Mv1Lu cells were treated with 0.1 nm TGF-β in the presence of 16 μm okadaic acid and 100 μm vanadate at 0 °C for 30 min. The cells were then incubated with antiserum to Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor (1:100 dilution) for 2 h at 0 °C. After washing with serum-free DMEM, the cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 buffer containing 20 μg of purified bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor and diluted to a final concentration of 0.1% Triton X-100 as described previously (14Liu Q. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18891-18895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The immunocomplexes in the supernatant of the cell lysates were then precipitated with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose gel (50%, v/v). After washing with 0.1% Triton X-100 buffer, the immunocomplexes were dissociated in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by 5% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and autoradiography. Preparation of 125I-TGF-β1 and125I-TGF-β3 and125I-TGF-β-affinity labeling of cell-surface TGF-β receptors were carried out as described previously (8O'Grady P. Kuo M.-D. Baldassare J.J. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8583-8589Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9O'Grady P. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 378-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). β-Glucuronidase (33 μg in 15 μl of 0.5m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.15m NaCl and 12 μm β-glycerol phosphate) was mixed with 10 μl of 1.5 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and 10 μl of 125I (1 mCi in 0.1 n NaOH). Five μl of chloramine T (100 μg/ml) were sequentially added into the reaction mixture at 2-, 3.5-, and 4.5-s intervals. After 1 min, the reaction was terminated by addition of 20 μl of 20 mm N-acetyltyrosine and 200 μl of 10% KI. The reaction mixture was then applied onto a column of Sephadex G-25 to remove free iodide. The 125I-β-glucuronidase had a specific radioactivity of 2–6 × 104 cpm/ng and was stored at −20 °C before use. Mv1Lu cells (0.6–1.0 × 105 cells/well) were grown on 24-well clustered dishes in 10% fetal calf serum in DMEM. After treatment with 0.1 nm TGF-β in 0.1% fetal calf serum at 37 °C for 12 h, the monolayers were incubated with various concentrations (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, 2.0, and 2.4 nm) of125I-β-glucuronidase in the presence and absence of 10 mm Man-6-P in binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mmMgSO4, and 1.2 mm CaCl2) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. After the binding of125I-β-glucuronidase reached equilibrium (2.5 h at 0 °C), the cells were washed with 1 ml of binding buffer three times. The cells were then dissolved in 0.2 ml of 0.2 nNaOH and counted. The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated binding of125I-β-glucuronidase was estimated by subtracting the binding in the presence of 10 mm Man-6-P from the binding in the absence of Man-6-P. The apparent K d values and receptor number of the Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated binding of125I-β-glucuronidase were determined by Scatchard plot analysis. The experiments for Scatchard plot analysis were repeated three times. Approximately 0.6–1.0 × 105 cells per well of Mv1Lu, R-1B, DR26, and RII-37 cells were plated on 24-well clustered dishes in 0.1% fetal calf serum in DMEM. The cells were then incubated with 0.1 nm TGF-β for various periods (0, 2, 6, 12, and 18 h). At each period, the cells were incubated with 2 nm125I-β-glucuronidase in the presence or absence of 2 mm Man-6-P in 0.1% fetal calf serum in DMEM. After 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed three times with binding buffer and dissolved in 0.4 ml of 0.2 n NaOH for radioactivity counting. The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated uptake of125I-β-glucuronidase was calculated by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 2 mm Man-6-P from the uptake in the absence of Man-6-P. The uptake assays were carried out in triplicate. Mv1Lu cells grown on cover glass slides were treated with 0.1 nm TGF-β for 12 h. The uptake of β-glucuronidase in these cells was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h with 2 nm β-glucuronidase in the presence or absence of 10 mm Man-6-P. After incubation, the cells were fixed with 100% methanol (4 °C). The fixed cells were incubated with 10% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min or longer. The cells were then incubated with non-immune serum or antiserum to β-glucuronidase (1:20 dilution in phosphate-buffered saline) at 37 °C for 1 h. After being washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline five times, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at room temperature for 1 h. The cells were then washed with 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline and visualized under a fluorescence microscope. After phosphorylation and SDS-PAGE, the 32P-labeled Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor was located by Coomassie Blue staining. The 32P-Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor band was cut out and washed extensively with 50% ethanol and vacuum-dried. The dried gels were rehydrated using 0.5 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.5, containing 2 μg ofl-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin. After incubation at 37 °C for 18 h, the supernatant was dried by Speed Vac, dissolved in 10 μl of H2O, and subjected to two-dimensional thin layer cellulose electrophoresis and chromatography. The solvent for the first-dimensional electrophoresis was acetic acid:pyridine:H2O (20:1:379, by volume). The solvent for the second-dimensional chromatography wasn-butyl alcohol:pyridine:acetic acid:H2O (37.5:25:7.5:30, by volume). The thin layer cellulose plates were dried in air and exposed to Kodak X-Omat films. 32P-Labeled bovine Man-6-P/IGF-II eluted from the SDS-polyacrylamide gel was subjected to trypsin digestion as described above. The tryptic digests were separated on reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (C8 column) with a linear gradient of acetonitrile from 0 to 70% in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid using an Applied Biosystems model 130A separation system. The peptide containing radioactivity was eluted at ∼20% acetonitrile and subjected to automated amino acid sequencing on an Applied Biosystems model 477 gas/liquid phase protein sequenator with an on-line Applied Biosystems model 120A phenylthiohydantoin amino acid analyzer. The average repetitive yield was estimated to be 93%. The identification of phosphorylated amino acid residues in 32P-labeled tryptic peptides was carried out as described previously (34Oda Y. Kuo M.-D. Huang S.S. Huang J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27318-27326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled human Man-6-P/IGF-II was eluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to trypsin digestion and two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping as described above. The32P-labeled tryptic peptides were extracted from the cellulose particles scraped from the thin layer plates with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The 32P-labeled tryptic peptides were then analyzed by automated Edman amino acid sequencing. Mv1Lu cells were plated on 35-mm Petri dishes in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal calf serum. The cells were incubated with 0.1 nm TGF-β or insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (0.5 and 1 μg/ml) for 12 or 18 h. The cells were incubated with 2 nm β-glucuronidase in the presence or absence of 10 mm Man-6-P in 0.1% fetal calf serum in DMEM. After 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were washed. The cell-associated β-glucuronidase was assayed using 4-methylumbelliferyl β-d-glucuronide as substrate according to the procedure of Brot et al. (35Brot F.E. Glaser J.H. Roozen K.J. Sly W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). One enzyme unit was defined as the nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone product released per ml of enzyme solution per h. The Man-6-P/IGF-II receptor-mediated uptake of β-glucuronidase was calculated by subtracting the uptake in the presence of 10 mm Man-6-P from the uptake in the absence of Man-6-P. The cellular proteins were determined with the Lowry method. Mv1Lu cells grown on 35-mm Petri dishes were treated with 5 mm Man-6-P ± 0.1 nm TGF-β for 12 h. The medium was then assayed for β-glucuronidase, β-hexosaminidase, α-galactosidase, and α-mannosidase. The enzyme assays were carried out as described previously (35Brot F.E. Glaser J.H. Roozen K.J. Sly W.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1974; 57: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the assay, the reaction mixture contained 25 μl of the medium and 100 μl of 10 mm 4-MU-β-d-glucuronide in 0.1 msodium citrate, pH 4.8, 5 mm4-MU-N-acetyl-β-d-glucosamide in 12 mm citrate, 20 mm sodium phosphate, pH 4.4, 5 mm 4-MU-α-d-galactoside in 40 mmcitrate phosphate, pH 4.8, or 1 mm4-MU-α-d-mannopyranoside in 50 mm citrate, pH 4.0. Enzyme activity units were expressed as nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone produced"
