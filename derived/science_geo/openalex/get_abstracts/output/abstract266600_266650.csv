https://openalex.org/W2073974376,"Acid-vulnerable areas are more numerous and widespread than believed 7 years ago. Lakes and streams in acid-vulnerable areas of northeastern North America have suffered substantial declines in acid-neutralizing capacity, the worst cases resulting in biological damage. Many invertebrates are very sensitive to acidification, with some disappearing at pH values as high as 6.0. However, the recent rate of acidification of lakes is slower than once predicted, in part the result of decreases in sulfur oxide emissions. A discussion of some of the processes that have contributed to the acidification of lakes as well as those that have protected acid-sensitive freshwaters is presented.

https://openalex.org/W2042977189,"The development of new techniques for infrared laser spectroscopy of molecular ions has resulted in an explosion of high-quality data for important charged molecules. Velocity modulation laser spectroscopy, which exploits the motions of charged particles in electrical plasmas to eliminate interference from neutral absorbers, is rapidly producing a large body of new results for both positive and negative molecular ions. This information will have an important impact on chemistry, biology, and astrophysics. 26 references, 2 figures."
https://openalex.org/W2008965920,"The high-transition-temperature superconducting ceramic material YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-x) (0< x < 0.5) has been examined by field ion microscopy. Specimens from nominally superconducting and nonsuperconducting samples(determined by magnetic susceptibility measurements) were studied by field ion microscopy and significant differences were found. Preferential imaging of atomic or molecular layers, due to preferential field evaporation, field ionization, or both, was found in the superconducting phase below the transition temperature and is interpreted as possible evidence for the occurrence of relatively highly conducting layers in the YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7-x) unit cell perpendicular to the orthorhombic c-axis. Similar results were obtained for YbBa(2)Cu(3)(7-x)."
https://openalex.org/W2000750438,"This article discusses a 2-day workshop which was held by researchers attempting to find new superconducting materials. Topics discussed including synthesizing compounds which have the CuO[sub 2] planes in different environments, the superconducting properties of the bismuthates, fulleride superconductors, nitride synthesis and properties, molecular beam epitaxy techniques for fabricating oxide structures, etc. General guidelines for finding new superconductors are given as follows. Materials should be multicomponent structures with more than two sites per unit cell, where one or more sites not involved in the conduction band can be used to introduce itinerant charge carriers. Compositions should be near the metal-insulator Mott transition. On the insulating side of the Mott transition, the localized states should have spin-1/2 ground states and antiferromagnetic ordering the parent compound. The conduction band should be formed from antibonding tight-binding states that have a high degree of cation-anion hybridization near the Fermi level. There should be no extended metal-metal bonds. Structural features that are desirable include two-dimensional extended sheets or clusters with controllable linkage, or both."

The broad range of stable organorhenium compounds can be traced to the availability of oxidation states from -III to VII and to the high strength of bonds to rhenium. New types of reaction mechanism are seen in response to the reluctance of rhenium to form coordinatively unsaturated complexes."

https://openalex.org/W2071563363,"Mainstream chemistry is beginning to look at environmental chemistry as an important solution to environmental problems. This can include research into developing cleaner-burning liquid fuels, cleaning up oil spills, or developing better process methods which engender less pollution, as opposed to previous practices of detecting pollutants without preventing their release to begin with. This article discusses the progress of this chemistry discipline, describes some of the ongoing research, and describes the future for environmental chemistry. An impetus for future growth will be generational change, as young scientists in training are beginning to push faculities into creating programs for environmental chemistry."

https://openalex.org/W2028870455,"First there were 43, then 36, and now just 8 candidate sites remain for the proposed Superconducting Super Collider (SSC). Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas have been selected by a committee of the National Research Council as the best locations for the $5.3-billion particle collider. The committee made its selection from 36 site proposals, backed by truck loads of supporting documents, that the Department of Energy (DOE) asked it to review. Not surprisingly the choice has proved controversial. At least four states - California, Ohio, Mississippi, and Nevada - are lodging protests with Energy Secretary John Herrington, claiming that they should not have been cut. Herrington is reviewing the committee's recommendations and will announce a list of finalists next week."

Earthquakes, the local California variety in particular, figured prominently, as did the currently popular subjects of ancient air trapped in amber and the deepening Antarctic ozone hole."
