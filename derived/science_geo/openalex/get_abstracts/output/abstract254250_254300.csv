https://openalex.org/W2029301182,"Recent RNA interference screens have identified several proteins that are essential for store-operated Ca2+ influx and Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel activity in Drosophila and in mammals, including the transmembrane proteins Stim (stromal interaction molecule) and Orai. Stim probably functions as a sensor of luminal Ca2+ content and triggers activation of CRAC channels in the surface membrane after Ca2+ store depletion. Among three human homologues of Orai (also known as olf186-F), ORAI1 on chromosome 12 was found to be mutated in patients with severe combined immunodeficiency disease, and expression of wild-type Orai1 restored Ca2+ influx and CRAC channel activity in patient T cells. The overexpression of Stim and Orai together markedly increases CRAC current. However, it is not yet clear whether Stim or Orai actually forms the CRAC channel, or whether their expression simply limits CRAC channel activity mediated by a different channel-forming subunit. Here we show that interaction between wild-type Stim and Orai, assessed by co-immunoprecipitation, is greatly enhanced after treatment with thapsigargin to induce Ca2+ store depletion. By site-directed mutagenesis, we show that a point mutation from glutamate to aspartate at position 180 in the conserved S1-S2 loop of Orai transforms the ion selectivity properties of CRAC current from being Ca2+-selective with inward rectification to being selective for monovalent cations and outwardly rectifying. A charge-neutralizing mutation at the same position (glutamate to alanine) acts as a dominant-negative non-conducting subunit. Other charge-neutralizing mutants in the same loop express large inwardly rectifying CRAC current, and two of these exhibit reduced sensitivity to the channel blocker Gd3+. These results indicate that Orai itself forms the Ca2+-selectivity filter of the CRAC channel."

However, an often-overlooked component of plant diversity, namely population genotypic diversity, may also have wide-ranging effects on community structure and ecosystem processes. We showed experimentally that increasing population genotypic diversity in a dominant old-field plant species, Solidago altissima , determined arthropod diversity and community structure and increased ANPP. The effects of genotypic diversity on arthropod diversity and ANPP were comparable to the effects of plant species diversity measured in other studies."

https://openalex.org/W1997405299,"In 1988, the National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study (NVVRS) of a representative sample of 1200 veterans estimated that 30.9% had developed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during their lifetimes and that 15.2% were currently suffering from PTSD. The study also found a strong dose-response relationship: As retrospective reports of combat exposure increased, PTSD occurrence increased. Skeptics have argued that these results are inflated by recall bias and other flaws. We used military records to construct a new exposure measure and to cross-check exposure reports in diagnoses of 260 NVVRS veterans. We found little evidence of falsification, an even stronger dose-response relationship, and psychological costs that were lower than previously estimated but still substantial. According to our fully adjusted PTSD rates, 18.7% of the veterans had developed war-related PTSD during their lifetimes and 9.1% were currently suffering from PTSD 11 to 12 years after the war; current PTSD was typically associated with moderate impairment."

With the exception of bacterial cellulose synthases, the identities of c-di-GMP receptors and end targets have remained unknown. Recently, Amikam and Galperin (Amikam, D., and Galperin, M. (2006) Bioinformatics 22, 3–6) hypothesized that the PilZ domains present in the BcsA subunits of bacterial cellulose synthases function in c-di-GMP binding. This hypothesis has been tested here using the Escherichia coli PilZ domain protein YcgR, its individual PilZ domain and the PilZ domain from Gluconacetobacter xylinus BcsA. YcgR was purified and found to bind c-di-GMP tightly and specifically, Kd 0.84 μm. Individual PilZ domains from YcgR and BcsA also bound c-di-GMP, albeit with lesser affinity, indicating that PilZ is sufficient for binding. The site-directed mutagenesis performed on YcgR implicated the most conserved residues in the PilZ domain directly in c-di-GMP binding. It is suggested that c-di-GMP binding to PilZ brings about conformational changes in the protein that stabilize the bound ligand and initiate the downstream signal transduction cascade. While the identity of the downstream partner(s) of YcgR remains unknown, it is shown that YcgR regulates flagellum-based motility in a c-di-GMP-dependent manner. The inactivation of ycgR improves swimming and swarming motility of the poorly motile yhjH mutants of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UMR1. Therefore, biochemical and genetic evidence presented here establishes PilZ as a long sought after c-di-GMP-binding domain and YcgR as a c-di-GMP receptor affecting motility in enterobacteria.

Cyclic dimeric GMP, c-di-GMP, has emerged as a second messenger specific to the domain of Bacteria. c-di-GMP controls a variety of cellular processes, mainly biogenesis and function of extracellular components, flagella and pili, and exopolysaccharide synthesis. This makes c-di-GMP a key regulator in bacterial transition from a motile, single-cellular to a sessile, often multicellular lifestyle (1Römling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). c-di-GMP turnover is regulated through the action of diguanylate cyclases and c-di-GMP-specific phosphodiesterases. The cyclase activity is encoded in the GGDEF protein domains (also known as DUF1) (2Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U.

Williams P. Dow J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6712-6717Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). Bacteria, especially from the proteobacterial branch, contain numerous enzymes involved in c-di-GMP turnover to monitor various environmental and intracellular inputs and adjust c-di-GMP levels in the precise manner. Despite significant progress in elucidating the enzymology of c-di-GMP turnover and in uncovering c-di-GMP-dependent processes, the molecular mechanisms of c-di-GMP action remain essentially unknown (1Römling U. Gomelsky M. Galperin M.Y. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 629-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). This represents the main impediment to our understanding of c-di-GMP-dependent signaling. The only end target of c-di-GMP action that was verified in vitro is the membrane-associated cellulose synthase from Gluconacetobacter xylinus. This enzyme consists of the catalytic and regulatory subunits, BcsA and BcsB, which are sufficient for the catalysis in vitro. Benziman and colleagues (8Ross P. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Amikam D.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) showed that c-di-GMP acts as an allosteric activator of BcsAB. Recently, Amikam and Galperin (11Amikam D. Galperin M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), based on the bioinformatics analysis, put forth a hypothesis that the C-terminal domain of BcsA is involved in c-di-GMP binding. This domain shares similarity with the described earlier single-domain PilZ protein from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which gave rise to the name “PilZ domain” (Pfam: PF07238 (12Finn R. Mistry J. Schuster-Bockler B. Griffiths-Jones S. Hollich V. Lassmann T. Moxon S. Marshall M. Khanna A. Durbin R. Eddy S. Sonnhammer E. Bateman A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D247-D251Crossref PubMed Scopus (1844) Google Scholar)). The P. aeruginosa PilZ protein is involved in pili formation and twitching motility (13Alm R. Bodero A. Free P. Mattick J. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 46-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Amikam and Galperin (11Amikam D. Galperin M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) noticed that some PilZ domains are localized C-terminally of the GGDEF-EAL and HD-GYP modules, which suggested their association with c-di-GMP. Several experimentally studied proteins involved in polysaccharide synthesis, motility, and cell differentiation, i.e. the processes known to be regulated by c-di-GMP, contain PilZ domains (14Maharaj R. May T.B. Wang S.K. Chakrabarty A.M. Gene (Amst.). 1993; 136: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 15Munoz-Dorado J. Inouye S. Inouye M.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6595-6604Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This further strengthened the prediction that PilZ is involved in c-di-GMP binding. Is the PilZ domain indeed the long sought after c-di-GMP receptor? Here we tested this hypothesis directly using the PilZ domain protein YcgR from Escherichia coli as well as its individually expressed PilZ domain and the PilZ domain from G. xylinus BcsA. YcgR is one of two PilZ domain proteins present in E. coli, the second one being BcsA-Ec. YcgR was originally described as a novel member of the E. coli flagellum machinery, because in a Δhns background lacking the H-NS nucleoid protein, the ycgR null mutation resulted in improved motility (17Ko M. Park C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Strains and Plasmids—The following wild-type strains were used in this work: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium UMR1 (18Römling U. Bian Z. Hammar M. Sierralta W.D. Normark S. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 722-731Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and E. coli TOB1 (19Gerstel U. Park C. Römling U. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 639-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). All strains used in this study are described in Table S1 in the online supplemental material. Knock-out mutants were constructed by a one-step gene inactivation described by Datsenko and Wanner (20Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). In general, the entire open reading frame except 40 bp at the beginning and end was replaced with the chloramphenicol resistance cassette. The Typhimurium yhjH ycgR double mutant MAE471 was created from the derivative of the yhjH mutant MAE420 by phage transduction using P22 HT105/1 int-201 (21Schmieger H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1972; 119: 75-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). All mutants were colony purified twice and verified by PCR. E. coli MG1655 was used for PCR amplification of the ycgR gene and the PilZ domain of YcgR, PilZ_YcgR, used for protein purification. G. xylinus was used for PCR-amplification of the fragment corresponding to the PilZ domain of BcsA1, PilZ_BcsA. The amplified DNA fragments were cloned into the overexpression vector pET-23a to generate C-terminal His6 fusions, which were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the ycgR template using mutant primers and the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For complementation analysis, the wild-type and mutant ycgR constructs were cloned into vector pBAD30 (22Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar). All primers used in this study are shown in Table S2 in the online supplemental material. Protein Purification—The YcgR and PilZ_BcsA were purified as soluble C-terminal His6-tag fusions using nickel affinity chromatography according to the manufacturer's protocol (EMD Biosciences). Proteins were additionally purified with size exclusion chromatography, where necessary. PilZ_YcgR, which proved to be insoluble, was purified from inclusion bodies as described in the supplemental material. All proteins were purified to ≥90% purity as assessed by capillary electrophoresis (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE). Protein concentrations were measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Chromatography—Purification of proteins and determination of their oligomeric states was done using a Superdex 200 10/300 GL gel filtration column in the fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Biosciences) as described earlier (3Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Nucleotides were separated and analyzed using the reversed phase HPLC 3The abbreviation used is: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (Summit HPLC System, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA), 15 × 4.6 cm Supelcosil LC-18-T column (Sigma). The buffers and gradient program were described earlier (3Ryjenkov D.A. Tarutina M. Moskvin O.V. Gomelsky M. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 1792-1798Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Proteins and nucleotides were monitored by A280. Equilibrium Dialysis—The following buffer was used in the equilibrium dialysis experiments: 300 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. Protein-nucleotide binding was examined by equilibrium dialysis in Dispo-Biodialyzer cassettes (The Nest Group, Southborough, MA). c-di-GMP or other tested nucleotides (concentrations from 2 to 50 μm) were injected into one cell of a cassette, while analyzed proteins were injected into the opposite cell, which is separated by a dialysis membrane with a 5-kDa molecular weight cutoff. The proteins were used at the following concentrations: YcgR and its site-directed mutants, 10 ± 2 μm; PilZ_YcgR, 10 μm; and PilZ_BscA, 30 μm. The cassettes were maintained for 25 h at room temperature under moderate agitation to reach equilibrium. The samples (45 μl) from both cassette cells were taken, boiled for 4 min (to denature the protein, where present), and centrifuged, and supernatants were filtrated through a 0.22-μm microfilter. The nucleotide concentrations were quantified by measuring peak areas of the eluted nucleotides from the HPLC column. Binding constants were calculated by the GraphPad Prism software, version 4.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA) using nonlinear regression model. Motility Assays—For swimming motility, 0.3% swim agar plates were inoculated with 5 μl of overnight culture resuspended in water (A600 5). After 6 h the diameter of the swimming zone was measured. For swarming motility, 0.5% swarm agar plates were used. The zones formed by the swarming bacteria were measured after 5 h. E. coli YcgR Is a c-di-GMP-binding Protein—To test whether the E. coli PilZ domain protein YcgR (Fig. 1A) binds c-di-GMP, we overexpressed it as a C-terminal His-tag fusion and purified it using nickel column affinity and gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 2A). We tested the ability of YcgR to bind various nucleotides, including c-di-GMP, using equilibrium dialysis. YcgR bound c-di-GMP with a Kd of 0.84 ± 0.16 μm (Fig. 2B). This value is similar to or somewhat lower than the estimated intracellular c-di-GMP levels, believed to be in the 1–10 μm range in the proteobacterial species (2Paul R. Weiser S. Amiot N.C. Chan C. Schirmer T. Giese B. Jenal U. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 715-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 10Weinhouse H. Sapir S. Amikam D. Shilo Y. Volman G. Ohana P. Benziman M.

Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1123-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). Therefore, YcgR must be responsive to physiologically relevant changes in c-di-GMP levels. We detected no binding of other nucleotides, including cGMP, cAMP, or GMP (data not shown), which suggests that YcgR is highly c-di-GMP-specific.FIGURE 2A, SDS-PAGE showing purified YcgR (lane 1), the PilZ domain from YcgR, PilZ_YcgR (lane 2), and the PilZ domain from BcsA, PilZ_BcsA (lane 3).

To further investigate the protein-c-di-GMP ratio, we incubated YcgR with the excess of c-di-GMP and subjected the mixture to size exclusion chromatography. The recovered YcgR protein contained bound c-di-GMP and the protein: c-di-GMP ratio was found to be 1:2.09 ± 0.11, which nicely corroborates the value obtained by equilibrium dialysis. Interestingly, the shape of the equilibrium dialysis curve is most consistent with YcgR containing a single binding site. Since c-di-GMP has been reported to exist in aqueous solutions primarily as a self-intercalated dimer (24Zhang Z. Kim S. Gaffney B.L. Jones R.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006; 128: 7015-7024Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and a c-di-GMP dimer was observed in the allosteric site, I-site, of the Caulobacter crescentus diguanylate cyclase PleD (25Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we suggest that one molecule of YcgR binds one c-di-GMP dimer at a single binding site. YcgR is composed of two domains: PilZN (designated “YcgR” in the Pfam data base, Pfam: PF07317) of unknown function and PilZ (Fig. 1A). To directly assess the role of the PilZ domain in c-di-GMP binding, we mutated several conserved residues of this domain. These were chosen based on analysis of the multiple sequence alignment of 691 PilZ domains (Fig. 1A). Only a small number of conserved motifs and residues are present in the PilZ domains, among which are the 114RxxR and 145D/NzSxGG motifs, where x is any residue, and z is a small hydrophobic residue (numbering based on YcgR) (Fig. 1A). Examination of the x-ray structure of the PilZ domain protein VCA0042, solved in the absence of c-di-GMP, reveals that these two motifs are located (i) in the immediate proximity of each other and (ii) close to the PilZNR domain, where PilZNR is a domain of unknown function unrelated to PilZN (11Amikam D. Galperin M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). Since arginines were found to form hydrogen bonds with O6 and N7 of the guanyls of c-di-GMP in the I-site of PleD (25Chan C. Paul R. Samoray D. Amiot N.C. Giese B. Jenal U. Schirmer T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17084-17089Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the conserved arginines of the PilZ domains, 114RxxR, are directly involved in c-di-GMP binding. To test the role of Arg118 in c-di-GMP binding, we generated by site-directed mutagenesis an 118R → D substitution (Fig. 1, A and B). The purified mutant YcgR 118R → D protein was tested by equilibrium dialysis and found to be completely impaired in c-di-GMP binding (data not shown). This is consistent with our prediction that Arg118 is directly involved in c-di-GMP binding. Furthermore, this confirms that YcgR has only one c-di-GMP-binding site. Ser147 is also highly conserved in PilZ domains (Fig. 1, A and B); however, its role in c-di-GMP binding is less obvious. We introduced the 147S → A mutation and found that it actually somewhat improved affinity to c-di-GMP, i.e. Kd 0.69 μm. This is consistent with the involvement of the 145D/NzSxGG motif in c-di-GMP binding but shows that Ser147 is not critical for binding. A replacement of two conserved glycines to alanines, 149GG → AA, resulted in the insoluble mutant protein. Apparently the loop formed by these glycines is essential for protein structural integrity. We did not pursue the in vitro analysis of the 149GG → AA mutant any further. c-di-GMP Binding to Single PilZ Domains—The PilZN-PilZ domain arrangement present in the E. coli YcgR is conserved in many bacteria. However, PilZ domains also exist as stand-alone, single-domain proteins or in association with domains different from PilZN. We wondered whether the PilZ domain in itself is sufficient for c-di-GMP binding. We overexpressed the PilZ domain from YcgR, PilZ_YcgR, as a C-terminal His-tag fusion. Upon overexpression, PilZ_YcgR formed inclusion bodies. We purified the denatured protein by nickel affinity chromatography followed by its renaturation. The soluble, renatured PilZ_YcgR bound c-di-GMP, however, less efficiently than the full-length protein (Kd 1.45 μm). This establishes that an individual PilZ domain is sufficient for c-di-GMP binding. To investigate whether PilZ domains from other sources could bind c-di-GMP, we overexpressed and purified the C terminus of G. xylinus BcsA containing the PilZ domain, PilZ_BcsA (Fig. 1A). We found that the purified PilZ_BcsA bound c-di-GMP; however, the binding affinity (Kd 30 μm) was significantly worse than that reported for BcsBA (10Weinhouse H. Sapir S. Amikam D. Shilo Y. Volman G. Ohana P. Benziman M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 416: 207-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Taken together with the inferior c-di-GMP binding by PilZ_YcgR compared with binding by the full-length YcgR, this indicates that protein regions outside of the PilZ domains are involved in ligand binding. What could be the role of these regions? One possibility is that c-di-GMP binding involves protein di-/oligomerization, which would be lacking in the stand-alone domains. To explore this possibility, we examined oligomeric states of YcgR, PilZ_YcgR, and PilZ_BcsA using size exclusion chromatography. We found that all proteins exist as monomers (Fig. 2C and data not shown). We further explored whether the oligomeric state of YcgR changes upon c-di-GMP binding and found that it did not (Fig. 2C). This implies that di-/oligomerization of PilZ domain-containing proteins is not important for c-di-GMP binding. Another possibility is that c-di-GMP binding changes conformation of not only PilZ but also that of the N-terminal PilZN domain of YcgR. We noticed that in VCA0042, the conserved motifs implicated in c-di-GMP binding are localized near the PilZNR-PilZ domain-domain interface (Fig. 1B). Therefore, one can envision that c-di-GMP binding to PilZ would also bring PilZNR closer to PilZ and engage certain residues of PilZNR in c-di-GMP binding. We tested this possibility by comparing the apparent molecular masses of the ligand-free and c-di-GMP-loaded YcgR. We observed that the YcgR-c-di-GMP complex consistently migrated as a smaller, more compact, protein (apparent molecular mass 29.5 kDa) compared with the ligand-free YcgR (32.1 kDa) despite the fact that it actually is heavier by the mass of the c-di-GMP dimer (1.4 kDa) (Fig. 2C). Therefore, it does appear that c-di-GMP binding brings the two domains of YcgR closer. Therefore, PilZN may provide additional contacts to stabilize the bound c-di-GMP ligand and improve binding affinity. YcgR Regulates Motility in Enterobacteria in the c-di-GMP-dependent Manner—To identify what c-di-GMP-dependent phenotypes are mediated by YcgR, we knocked out the ycgR genes in the wild-type E. coli isolate TOB1 and in Typhimurium UMR1, where ycgR is STM1798. We assayed for several phenotypes known to be c-di-GMP-dependent, i.e. rdar morphotype (rough, dry, and rugose colony) (26Römling U. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1234-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), adherence to an abiotic surface and biofilm formation, as well as swimming and swarming motility. We detected no differences in any of the known c-di-GMP-associated phenotypes between the ycgR null mutants of Typhimurium or E. coli and their wild-type strains (data not shown). The lack of an observable phenotype(s) probably indicates that our assays were done under suboptimal conditions. For example, we could readily miss the ycgR knockout phenotype(s), if intracellular c-di-GMP levels were low and YcgR was inactive in the first place. The yhjH mutation is expected to result in elevated c-di-GMP levels because YhjH is a c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase that strongly affects swimming motility in E. coli and Typhimurium (17Ko M. Park C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Simm R. Morr M. Kader A. Nimtz M. Römling U. Mol.

Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 2233-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effect of the ycgR knockout in the yhjH mutant background. The Typhimurium yhjH mutant MAE420 displayed over 60% reduction in swimming motility as compared with the wild-type UMR1 (Fig. 3A), which is similar to what was observed in E. coli (17Ko M. Park C. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 303: 371-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The inactivation of the ycgR gene in the yhjH background greatly improved swimming motility, i.e. the motility of the yhjH ycgR double mutant MAE471 was restored to 80% of the wild type UMR1. This suggests that YcgR requires c-di-GMP to manifest its effect on swimming. Complementation of the Typhimurium yhjH ycgR double mutant MAE471 with the wild-type ycgR gene either from E. coli K12 or from Typhimurium brought back the swimming motility defect. The same was true, when we introduced the 147S → A mutant of YcgR, which is not impaired in c-di-GMP binding. However, when we introduced the 118R → D mutant defective in c-di-GMP binding, it had no effect on swimming, and neither did the 149GG → AA mutant (Fig. 3A). From these observations we conclude that YcgR regulates swimming motility in the c-di-GMP-dependent manner, i.e. it functions as a true c-di-GMP receptor in vivo. The swarming motility is also dramatically decreased in the Typhimurium yhjH mutant MAE420 compared with the wild-type UMR1 (Fig. 3B). 4R. Simm, A. Lusch, K. Abdul, M. Andersson, and U. Römling, submitted for publication. Consistent with the results from the swimming motility experiments, the swarming motility was partially restored in the yhjH ycgR double mutant MAE471. Furthermore, introduction of the wild-type and mutant ycgR genes into MAE471 resulted in the similar outcomes as those described for the swimming motility (compare Fig. 3, A and B). When we assayed the Typhimurium yhjH ycgR double mutant, the yhjH mutant, and the wild type for additional c-di-GMP-dependent phenotypes, i.e. rdar morphotype, abiotic surface adherence, and biofilm formation, we found these strains indistinguishable. This suggests that YcgR is specific to c-di-GMP-dependent regulation of the flagellum-based motility. Until recently, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which c-di-GMP operates has remained at the level of 1980s, when Benziman and co-workers (8Ross P. Mayer R. Weinhouse H. Amikam D. Huggirat Y. Benziman M. de Vroom E. Fidder A. de Paus P. Sliedregt L.A. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. J. Biol.

U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5472-5476Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) showed that c-di-GMP works as an allosteric activator of cellulose synthase BcsAB in G. xylinus. The hypothesis of Amikam and Galperin (11Amikam D. Galperin M. Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 3-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) that the PilZ domain present in the C termini of the BcsA subunits of bacterial cellulose synthases is involved in c-di-GMP binding was a long awaited breakthrough. In this study, we tested this hypothesis both in vitro and in vivo. We presented evidence that the E. coli PilZ domain protein YcgR binds c-di-GMP in vitro tightly and specifically, with the affinity that would allow it to respond to changes in intracellular c-di-GMP levels. We also showed that YcgR requires c-di-GMP in vivo for regulation of the flagellum-based motility. YcgR is dedicated to regulation of motility and not any other known c-di-GMP-dependent phenotypes. The PilZN-PilZ domain arrangement present in YcgR is conserved in the proteobacteria beyond Enterobacteriaceae (genera Burkholderia, Chromobacterium, Dechloromonas, Nitrosomonas, Ralstonia, Thiobacillus). Therefore, the function of YcgR in motility control is likely to be conserved. The PilZ domains of YcgR and BcsA in themselves are sufficient for c-di-GMP binding. However, the binding affinities are inferior compared with the full-length proteins. We suggest that the nearby domains (e.g. PilZNR in VCA0042 and PilZN in YcgR) are involved in stabilizing the bound c-di-GMP and that improves affinity. This interpretation is based on the observation that the c-di-GMP binding site is apparently located right at the junction between PilZNR and PilZ in VCA0042 (PilZN and PilZ in YcgR) and that c-di-GMP binding promotes a more compact conformation in YcgR compared with the ligand-free protein. We predict that this conformational change represents a switch from the inactive to the active, c-di-GMP-bound YcgR, which initiates the downstream signal transduction cascade. Most enterobacteria contain only two PilZ domain proteins, YcgR and BcsA. Whether these proteins mediate all c-di-GMP-dependent effects or PilZ-independent pathways exist remains to be determined. We are grateful to Levan Darjania for helpful advice on protein-ligand assays, to Michael Galperin for stimulating discussions, and to Kurt Miller for valuable comments and manuscript proofreading."

The Kv2.1 potassium channel is highly phosphorylated in resting mammalian neurons. Activity-dependent Kv2.1 dephosphorylation by calcineurin induces graded hyperpolarizing shifts in voltage-dependent activation, causing suppression of neuronal excitability. Mass spectrometry–SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) identified 16 Kv2.1 phosphorylation sites, of which 7 were dephosphorylated by calcineurin. Mutation of individual calcineurin-regulated sites to alanine produced incremental shifts mimicking dephosphorylation, whereas mutation to aspartate yielded equivalent resistance to calcineurin. Mutations at multiple sites were additive, showing that variable phosphorylation of Kv2.1 at a large number of sites allows graded activity-dependent regulation of channel gating and neuronal firing properties."

We find that a wide variety of mutations that extend C. elegans ' life span confer resistance to these tumors. The long life spans of daf-2/ insulin-receptor mutants were not shortened at all by gld-1 mutations; we attribute this finding to decreased cell division and increased DAF-16/p53–dependent apoptosis within the tumors. Mutations that increase life span by restricting food intake or inhibiting respiration did not affect apoptosis but reduced tumor cell division. Unexpectedly, none of these longevity mutations affected mitosis in normal germlines; this finding suggests that cellular changes that lead to longevity preferentially antagonize tumor cell growth."

We therefore propose that both macroautophagy and the proteasome are important for the reduction of mutant SOD1-mediated neurotoxicity in fALS.

These findings have led to the conclusion that SOD1 mutants cause motor neuron degeneration by a toxic gain of function. Thus, studies of the degradation process of mutant SOD1 proteins could provide important insights into understanding the mechanisms that underlie the pathology of fALS, and possibly sporadic ALS, and into developing novel therapies for fALS by removing toxic species of mutant SOD1. Cytoplasmic proteins are mainly degraded by two pathways, the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathway (6Goldberg A.L. Nature. 2003; 426: 895-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (1672) Google Scholar) and autophagy (7Cuervo A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that mutant SOD1 proteins are turned over more rapidly than wild-type SOD1, and a proteasome inhibitor increases the level of mutant SOD1 proteins (8Hoffman E.K.

These observations suggest that mutant SOD1 is degraded by the ubiquitin-26 S proteasome pathway and that the increased turnover of mutant SOD1 is mediated in part by this pathway. On the other hand, the 20 S proteasome, a component of the 26 S proteasome, can degrade proteins without a requirement for ubiquitination (12Shringarpure R. Grune T. Mehlhase J. Davies K.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 311-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 13Asher G. Tsvetkov P. Kahana C. Shaul Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A recent study has found that metal-free forms of wild-type and mutant SOD1 are degraded by the 20 S proteasome in vitro (14Di Noto L. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Hart P.J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Autophagy is an intracellular process that results in the degradation of cytoplasmic components inside lysosomes. At least three forms of autophagy have been described in mammalian cells: macroautophagy, microautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy (7Cuervo A.M. Trends Cell Biol. 2004; 14: 70-77Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Macroautophagy is the major and the most well studied form of autophagy; this process begins with a sequestration step, in which cytosolic components are engulfed by a membrane sac called the isolation membrane. This membrane results in a double membrane structure called the autophagosome, which fuses with the lysosome. The inner membrane of the autophagosome and its protein and organelle contents are degraded by lysosomal hydrolases. Recent reports have demonstrated that macroautophagy plays an important role in preventing neurodegeneration in mice (15Komatsu M. Waguri S. Chiba T. Murata S. Iwata J. Tanida I. Ueno T. Koike M. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Nature. 2006; 441: 880-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2850) Google Scholar, 16Hara T. Nakamura K. Matsui M. Yamamoto A. Nakahara Y. Suzuki-Migishima R. Yokoyama M. Mishima K. Saito I. Okano H. Mizushima N. Nature. 2006; 441: 885-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (3130) Google Scholar). Although macroautophagy can be induced by starvation, this pathway may take place constitutively in mammals (17Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, inhibition of macroautophagy does not alter enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) levels (18Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase protein levels, 3T. Kabuta, Y. Suzuki, and K. Wada, unpublished data. suggesting that not all cytosolic proteins are degraded by macroautophagy. To date, however, there have been no reports of macroautophagy in mutant SOD1 clearance. In this study, we investigated the pathway by which human wild-type SOD1 and the A4V, G85R, and G93A SOD1 mutants are degraded in neuronal and nonneuronal cells. We show that wild-type and mutant SOD1 proteins are degraded by both the proteasomal pathway and macroautophagy. The experiments with inhibitors of these degradation pathways suggested that mutant SOD1 are degraded more rapidly than wild-type SOD1 in part by macroautophagy and that the contribution of macroautophagy to mutant SOD1 clearance is approximately equal to that of the proteasome pathway. Macroautophagy decreases mutant SOD1 protein levels in both nonionic detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions. In addition, we provide data indicating that macroautophagy has a role in mutant SOD1-mediated cell death. Plasmid Constructs—The expression plasmids pcDNA3-hSOD1 containing wild-type, A4V, G85R, and G93A mutant SOD1 were kindly donated by Ryosuke Takahashi (Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan) and Makoto Urushitani (Laval University, Quebec, Canada) (19Urushitani M. Kurisu J. Tsukita K. Takahashi R. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1030-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To construct a plasmid expressing human wild-type SOD1 with the HA tag at the carboxyl terminus of SOD1, HA-tagged SOD1 fragments were amplified by PCR using wild-type SOD1 cDNA (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL) as the template. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and NotI and cloned into an XhoI-NotI-digested pCI-neo vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The primers used were 5′-AAAACTCGAGCCGCCAAGATGGCGACGAAGGCCGTGTGCG-3′ and 5′-AAAAGCGGCCGCTTAAGCGTAATCTGGAACATCGTATGGGTATTGGGCGATCCCAATTACACCACA-3′. A plasmid expressing HA-tagged G93A SOD1 was generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To construct a plasmid expressing fusion protein of green fluorescent protein and LC3, LC3 fragments were amplified by PCR using rat LC3 cDNA (Open Biosystems) as the template. The PCR products were digested with BglII and EcoRI and cloned into a BglII-EcoRI-digested pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech). The primers used were 5′-ACTCAGATCTATGCCGTCCGAGAAGACCTTCAAA-3′ and 5′-TGCAGAATTCTTACACAGCCAGTGCTGTCCCGAA-3′. After construction, the DNA sequences of the plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Cell Culture and Transfection—The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, and the monkey kidney-derived cell line COS-7 were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS). Transient expression of each vector in Neuro2a and COS-7 cells was performed using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). For experiments with differentiated Neuro2a cells, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum and 20 μm retinoic acid) 24 h after transfection. Approximately 90% of cells in dishes (wells) were transfected in our experimental conditions (data not shown), and there was no notable differences in the transfection efficiency among the wells (supplemental Fig. S1). Treatment of Cells with Epoxomicin, 3-Methyladenine, Cycloheximide, Rapamycin, or NH4Cl—Cells grown in 12- or 6-well plates to 50–80% confluence were transfected with expression plasmids containing wild-type, A4V, G85R, or G93A mutant SOD1. 24 h after transfection, cells were incubated with epoxomicin (10 nm, 1 μm, 5 μm, or 10 μm; Sigma), 3-methyladenine (3-MA) (10, 20, or 30 mm; Sigma), rapamycin (100 or 200 nm; Sigma), 20 mm NH4Cl, and/or carrier (Me2SO or water) as a control. In some experiments, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to the cells to avoid the confounding effects of ongoing protein synthesis. Epoxomicin, cycloheximide, and rapamycin were dissolved in Me2SO, NH4Cl in water. 3-MA was freshly dissolved in culture medium 30 min before use. Cell Fractionation—For preparation of nonionic detergentsoluble and -insoluble fractions, adherent cells were harvested and lysed on ice for 15 min in 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors (Complete, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science). Lysates were centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were pooled and designated as the detergent-soluble fractions. After the pellets were washed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer, they were solubilized with SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 3% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitors) and sonicated. The resulting solution was used as the detergent-insoluble fraction. For preparation of total cell lysates containing both detergent-soluble and -insoluble fractions, cells were lysed in SDS buffer and sonicated. Protein concentrations were determined with the protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) or the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Western Blot Analysis—Western blotting was performed using standard procedures as described previously (20Kabuta T. Hakuno F. Asano T. Takahashi S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6846-6851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were as follows: anti-SOD1 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:4000; Stressgen Bioreagents, Victoria, Canada), anti-α-tubulin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:4000; Sigma), anti-β-actin mouse monoclonal antibody (1:5000; Sigma), anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody (1:4000; Sigma), anti-Beclin 1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1:500; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, CA), anti-Apg7/Atg7 rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:500; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). After overnight incubation with primary antibodies at 4 °C, each blot was probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (1:20,000; Pierce). Immunoreactive signals were visualized with SuperSignal West Dura extended duration substrate (Pierce) or SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce) and detected with a chemiluminescence imaging system (FluorChem; Alpha Innotech, San Leandro, CA). The signal intensity was quantified by densitometry using FluorChem software (Alpha Innotech). Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Preparation and Transfection—Double-stranded siRNA targeting mouse Beclin 1, mouse Atg7 and EGFP were purchased from RNAi Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). Sequences targeted by siRNA were selected using siDirect (RNAi Co., Ltd.): mouse Beclin 1 siRNA, sense (5′-GUCUACAGAAAGUGCUAAUAG-3′) and antisense (5′-AUUAGCACUUUCUGUAGACAU-3′); mouse Atg7 siRNA, sense (5′-GAGCGGCGGCUGGUAAGAACA-3′) and antisense (5′-UUCUUACCAGCCGCCGCUCAA-3′); EGFP siRNA, sense (5′-GCCACAACGUCUAUAUCAUGG-3′) and antisense (5′-AUGAUAUAGACGUUGUGGCUG-3′). EGFP siRNA was used as a control. Cells (3 × 105) were cotransfected with 1 μg of DNA and 3 μg of siRNA using Lipofectamine PLUS reagent (Invitrogen). Quantitative Assessment of Cell Viability and Cell Death—One day before transfection, Neuro2a cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well plates. 24 h after transfection with 0.4 μgof DNA/well, cells were cultured in differentiation medium with or without 10 mm 3-MA for 24 h. Cell death was assessed by a lactate dehydrogenase release assay using the CytoTox-ONE homogeneous membrane integrity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The percentage of cytotoxicity (Fig. 7G) was calculated according to this protocol. For assessment of cell viability, we used the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) assay and the ATP assay with the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution cell proliferation assay (Promega) and CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega), respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocols. Measurements with a multipleplate reader were performed after samples were transferred to 96-well assay plates. Statistical Analysis—For comparison of two groups, the statistical difference was determined by Student's t test. For comparison of more than two groups, analysis of variance was used. If the analysis of variance was significant, Dunnett's multiple comparison test was used as a post hoc test. Wild-type and Mutant SOD1 Are Degraded by the Proteasome—To determine whether SOD1 is degraded by the proteasome pathway, we assessed the effect of proteasome inhibitors on SOD1 protein clearance. Peptide aldehydes, such as MG132 or ALLN, and lactacystin are widely used proteasome inhibitors. However, peptide aldehydes also inhibit cathepsins and calpains, and lactacystin inhibits cathepsin A (21Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L.

Because these inhibitors are not proteasome-specific and may interfere with lysosomal function, we used epoxomicin as a selective proteasome inhibitor (23Meng L. Mohan R. Kwok B.H. Elofsson M. Sin N.

The degradation of wild-type and mutant SOD1 was suppressed by epoxomicin treatment (Fig. 1, B and C) (∼14-h increase in half-life; G93A; Fig. 1A, ii). Our finding that mutant SOD1 is degraded by the proteasome is in agreement with previous reports (8Hoffman E.K. Wilcox H.M. Scott R.W. Siman R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1996; 139: 15-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 9Johnston J.A. Dalton M.J. Gurney M.E. Kopito R.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To determine whether endogenous human wild-type SOD1 is also degraded by the proteasome, SOD1 clearance was examined using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. The proteasome inhibitor treatment promoted the accumulation of human SOD1 proteins (Fig. 1, D and E). These results indicate that endogenous wild-type SOD1 is degraded by the proteasome, also consistent with a previous report (14Di Noto L. Whitson L.J. Cao X. Hart P.J. Levine R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39907-39913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Wild-type and Mutant SOD1 Are Also Degraded by Macroautophagy—To date, there have been no reports of macroautophagy participating in human SOD1 clearance. We therefore investigated whether wild-type or mutant SOD1 was degraded by macroautophagy using 3-MA, an inhibitor of macroautophagy (18Ravikumar B. Duden R. Rubinsztein D.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 1107-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar, 25Qin Z.H. Wang Y. Kegel K.B. Kazantsev A. Apostol B.L. Thompson L.M. Yoder J. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. Hum. Mol.

Sulzer D. Science. 2004; 305: 1292-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (1572) Google Scholar). We initially confirmed that 3-MA inhibits the formation of autophagosomes in Neuro2a cells using green fluorescent protein-LC3, a marker of autophagosomes (27Kabeya Y. Mizushima N. Ueno T. Yamamoto A. Kirisako T. Noda T. Kominami E. Ohsumi Y. Yoshimori T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5720-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (5468) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). Moreover, we also showed that the clearance of α-synuclein, an established substrate for macroautophagy (28Webb J.L. Ravikumar B. Atkins J. Skepper J.N. Rubinsztein D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 25009-25013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar), was inhibited by 3-MA or ammonium chloride treatment (supplemental Fig. S3). Treatment of Neuro2a cells with 3-MA promoted the accumulation of G93A mutant SOD1 proteins (Fig. 2A). In the presence of cycloheximide, the degradation of wild-type and mutant SOD1 was suppressed by treatment with 3-MA (Fig. 2, B and C) (a more than 14-h increase in half-life; G93A, Fig. 2B), indicating that wild-type and mutant SOD1 are degraded by macroautophagy in these cells and that the accumulation of SOD1 proteins by 3-MA is not due to increased protein synthesis. These results, together with Fig. 1, suggest that mutant SOD1 are degraded more rapidly than wild-type SOD1 by macroautophagy (it is estimated that 15–20% of wild-type SOD1 and 25–30% of mutant SOD1 were degraded by macroautophagy during the 24-h incubation). The clearance of mutant G93A SOD1 was also decreased by treatment with ammonium chloride (Fig. 2D). As shown in supplemental Fig. S4 and Fig. 2D, the protein level of endogenous mouse SOD1 was increased by 3-MA or ammonium chloride treatment. The result shown in Fig. 2D further supports the role of the lysosomes in SOD1 degradation. To test the role of macroautophagy on SOD1 degradation in differentiated neuronal cells or neurons, we also used differentiated Neuro2a cells. In differentiated Neuro2a cells, 3-MA increased both wild-type and mutant SOD1 protein levels in the presence or absence of cycloheximide (data not shown). To determine whether endogenous human SOD1 is degraded by macroautophagy, the clearance of endogenous SOD1 was examined in SH-SY5Y cells. As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, the degradation of endogenous SOD1 proteins was inhibited by 3-MA. For further confirmation of the clearance of SOD1 by macroautophagy, we used rapamycin to induce macroautophagy (29Blommaart E.F. Luiken J.J. Blommaart P.J. van Woerkom G.M. Meijer A.J. J. Biol.

Treating Neuro2a cells with rapamycin decreased HA-tagged G93A SOD1 levels (Fig. 3, A and B). In differentiated Neuro2a cells, SOD1 protein levels were also decreased by rapamycin (Fig. 3C). Beclin 1 is a component of a class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase complex that is crucial for macroautophagy (31Liang X.H. Jackson S. Seaman M. Brown K. Kempkes B. Hibshoosh H. Levine B. Nature. 1999; 402: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (2752) Google Scholar). Silencing of the Beclin 1 gene by siRNA inhibits the generation of autophagosomes, thus preventing macroautophagy (32Shimizu S. Kanaseki T. Mizushima N. Mizuta T. Arakawa-Kobayashi S. Thompson C.B. Tsujimoto Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2004; 6: 1221-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). Atg7 protein is also essential for macroautophagy (17Komatsu M. Waguri S. Ueno T. Iwata J. Murata S. Tanida I. Ezaki J. Mizushima N. Ohsumi Y. Uchiyama Y. Kominami E. Tanaka K. Chiba T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 169: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). We initially confirmed that Beclin 1 or Atg7 expression was knocked down by Beclin 1 or Atg7 siRNA, respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). We also showed that α-synuclein level was increased by Beclin 1 or Atg7 siRNA (supplemental Fig. S3). We observed inhibited degradation of wild-type and mutant SOD1 in cells with Beclin 1 siRNA (Fig. 4, A and C) or Atg7 siRNA (Fig. 4, B and D) compared with cells with control siRNA (∼14 h increase in half-life; G93A; Fig. 4E). The results shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 demonstrate that wild-type and mutant SOD1 are also degraded by macroautophagy in neuronal cells. In the nonneuronal COS-7 cells, ammonium chloride or 3-MA treatment stimulated the accumulation of HA-tagged wild-type SOD1 and G93A SOD1 (Fig. 5A) or mutant G93A SOD1 (Fig. 5B), respectively. Treatment of the cells with epoxomicin also increased wild-type and mutant SOD1 levels (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. S5). These results indicate that wild-type and mutant SOD1 are degraded by both macroautophagy and the proteasome in COS-7 cells. The results shown in Figs. 3A and 5A indicate that not only SOD1 without a tag but also HA-tagged SOD1 is degraded by macroautophagy.FIGURE 4Silencing of macroautophagy genes promote the accumulation of SOD1 proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2007525719,"Chromosomal translocation is a common cause of leukaemia1 and the most common chromosome translocations found in leukaemia patients involve the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene2,3. AF10 is one of more than 30 MLL fusion partners in leukaemia4. We have recently demonstrated that the H3K79 methyltransferase hDOT1L contributes to MLL–AF10-mediated leukaemogenesis through its interaction with AF10 (ref. 5). In addition to MLL, AF10 has also been reported to fuse to CALM (clathrin-assembly protein-like lymphoid–myeloid) in patients with T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (T-ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)6,7. Here, we analysed the molecular mechanism of leukaemogenesis by CALM–AF10. We demonstrate that CALM–AF10 fusion is both necessary and sufficient for leukaemic transformation. Additionally, we provide evidence that hDOT1L has an important role in the transformation process. hDOT1L contributes to CALM–AF10-mediated leukaemic transformation by preventing nuclear export of CALM–AF10 and by upregulating the Hoxa5 gene through H3K79 methylation. Thus, our study establishes CALM–AF10 fusion as a cause of leukaemia and reveals that mistargeting of hDOT1L and upregulation of Hoxa5 through H3K79 methylation is the underlying mechanism behind leukaemia caused by CALM–AF10 fusion."
https://openalex.org/W2106278719,"Recent evidence suggests that antiangiogenic therapy is sensitive to p53 status in tumors, implicating a role for p53 in the regulation of angiogenesis. Here we show that p53 transcriptionally activates the alpha(II) collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase [alpha(II)PH] gene, resulting in the extracellular release of antiangiogenic fragments of collagen type 4 and 18. Conditioned media from cells ectopically expressing either p53 or alpha(II)PH selectively inhibited growth of primary human endothelial cells. When expressed intracellularly or exogenously delivered, alpha(II)PH significantly inhibited tumor growth in mice. Our results reveal a genetic and biochemical linkage between the p53 tumor suppressor pathway and the synthesis of antiangiogenic collagen fragments."

A hybrid zone between morphs showed a steep cline specifically at genes controlling flower color differences, indicating that these loci are under selection. Antirrhinum species with diverse floral phenotypes formed a U-shaped cloud within the genotypic space. We propose that this cloud defines an evolutionary path that allows flower color to evolve while circumventing less-adaptive regions. Hybridization between morphs located in different arms of the U-shaped path yields low-fitness genotypes, accounting for the observed steep clines at hybrid zones."

Interestingly, under transcriptional stress, nucleosomes at 3′ coding regions become trimethylated in a way depending on the chromodomain protein Chd1, suggesting a different mode of Set1 recruitment to chromatin (28Zhang L. Schroeder S. Fong N. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2379-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Paf1 and Rtf1, components of the Paf1 complex, have also been shown to be required for the Rad6/Bre1-mediated monoubiquitination of H2B on lysine 123 (29Wood A. Schneider J. Dover J. Johnston M.

Through a so-called “trans-tail” process, di- and trimethylation of H3K4 depends on H2B ubiquitination (31Sun Z.W. Allis C.D. Nature. 2002; 418: 104-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar, 32Dover J. Schneider J. Tawiah-Boateng M.A. Wood A. Dean K. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28368-28371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and components of the Paf1 complex (Paf1, Rtf1, and Ctr9) are required for di- and trimethylation of H3K4 (24Krogan N.J. Dover J. Wood A. Schneider J. Heidt J. Boateng M.A. Dean K. Ryan O.W. Golshani A. Johnston M. Greenblatt J.F. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 721-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar). However, although Rtf1 also appears important for monomethylation of H3K4, neither Paf1 nor ubiquitination of histone H2B are essential for H3K4 monomethylation (27Dehé P.M. Pamblanco M. Luciano P.

Interestingly, a screen meant to identify components that selectively regulate H3K4 trimethylation identified the Bur cyclin-dependent kinase whose inactivation impairs the recruitment of the Paf elongation complex to genes and H2B ubiquitination (34Laribee R.N.

Dover J. Johnston M. Shilatifard A. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 589-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), suggesting that low levels of ubiquitination are sufficient to promote mono- and dimethylation of H3K4. In this study, we have investigated protein/protein interactions within Set1C and determined their role in the integrity of the complex and the regulation of H3K4 methylation. The Two-hybrid System in Escherichia coli—Protein interactions have been studied by a bacterial two-hybrid approach based on the functional reconstitution of adenylate cyclase activity of Bordetella pertussis in the E. coli cya strain (36Karimova G. Dautin N. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2233-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Pairs of proteins to be tested were fused to the two catalytic domains T18 and T25 of adenylate cyclase using plasmids pKT25link and pUT18link and their derivatives (36Karimova G. Dautin N. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2233-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 37Gully D. Bouveret E. Proteomics. 2005; 6: 282-293Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). After co-transformation of the BTH101 strain by the two plasmids expressing the fusions, 3 ml of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin and 0.5 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside were inoculated with ten randomly chosen transformants and grown at 30 °C to an A600nm of 1. Thereafter, 2-μl drops were spotted on McConkey plates supplemented with 1% maltose and on X-gal plates. The plates were incubated 3 days at 30 °C. An interaction is considered positive if detection of β-galactosidase activity is obtained in >3 independent transformations. Epitope Tagging of Set1, Mutant Strains, and TAP Purification—Set1 was tagged at its N terminus with a 9-Myc epitope as follows. A NotI restriction site was introduced just after the ATG codon of SET1 into a genomic fragment extending from -497 +1179 bp in respect to the ATG of SET1. This DNA fragment was cloned into the integrative plasmids Yiplac128 (LEU2) and Yiplac204 (TRP1). A 9-Myc epitope was introduced in-frame into NotI. The resulting plasmids (p9MycSET1-LEU2 or p9MycSET1-TRP1) were digested with SnaBI prior to transformation of yeast cells. The tagged 9-Myc-Set1 was fully functional for all of the set1 phenotypes that were tested. Full deletions of set1, swd1, swd3, bre2, sdc1, spp1, and shg1 were in the BY4741 background (Euroscarf). All experiments were done in BY4741, except TAP tag introduction and TAP purification, which were performed in strain MGD-353-13D according to Roguev et al. (2Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Preparation of Histones, Microsequencing Analysis, and Western Blot Analysis—Histones were isolated by a procedure described in Ref. 38Poveda A. Pamblanco M. Tafrov S. Tordera V. Sternglanz R. Sendra R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16033-16043Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar. Histone preparations were subjected to 16% SDS-PAGE and either Coomassie Blue-stained or transferred onto a 0.2-μm Protran® nitrocellulose membrane. For Western blot analysis, the antibodies used to detect di- and trimethylated H3K4 were anti-H3K4me2 and -H3K4me3 (Abcam). N-terminal sequence determination was performed by stepwise Edman degradation using an automatic sequencer model Procise 494 from Applied Biosystems. Histone H3 bands from blotted protein on 0.2-μm polyvinylidene difluoride, stained with Coomassie blue, were excised and put on a Problott cartridge (Applied Biosystems). For all samples, a pulse liquid polyvinylidene difluoride protein program was performed, and phenylthiohydantoin amino acids were identified by high pressure liquid chromatography using a Brownlee C18 column (5 μm, 220 × 2.1 mm) with an 18-min gradient of B (acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol, v/v) in A (3.5% H4folate/water) from 16-46% B at 55 °C and with the wavelength set at 269 nm. A solution of 20 phenylthiohydantoin amino acids standard (10 pmol) was used for calibrating every run. Simultaneous Set1 and Rap1 detection in yeast whole-cell extracts was carried as follows. Whole-cell extracts were prepared by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Identical amounts of whole-cell extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline. Anti-Set1 (provided by Dr. Peter Nagy, Molecular Oncology Testing, Medical Research Center, Iowa City, IA) and anti-Rap1 (provided by Dr. David Shore, University of Genève, Geneva, Switzerland) antibodies (1:1000 dilution) were incubated for 3 h in 5% milk/phosphate-buffered saline. Infrared-labeled secondary antibodies IRDye 800 anti-rabbit goat IgG (Rockland) and Alexa Fluor® 680 anti-mouse goat IgG (Molecular Probes) were used at a dilution of 1:10000. Emitted fluorescence of the secondary antibodies was detected by scanning on an Odyssey Imager (LI-COR Bioscience). Antibodies BWG16, H14, and H3 used to detect the different forms of pol II CTD in Western blot were purchased from Covance. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Experiments—ChIPs were done using 50-ml cultures fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min (27Dehé P.M. Pamblanco M. Luciano P. Lebrun R. Moinier D. Sendra R. Verreault A. Tordera V. Géli V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were broken using glass beads, and fixed chromatin was broken by sonication using a Bioruptor (Diagenode). Average DNA fragment lengths were 150 bp. 360-μl aliquots of chromatin were incubated with the indicated antibodies in 1.5 ml of siliconized eppendorfs at 4 °C for 15-20 h and immunoprecipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Dynabeads) for 90 min at 4 °C. After washing, the chromatin was eluted from the beads at 65 °C for 30 min. Cross-links were reversed by incubation at 65 °C for 20 h. DNA was purified using Invitrogen PCR minicolumns (Pure-Link) and eluted in 200 μl of water. Samples were subject to real-time PCR using a light cycler (Roche Applied Science) and Sybr Green mix. ChIPs were expressed as a ratio immunoprecipitation:input (IP:input). ChIPs against the methylated states of H3K4 are normalized to the IPH3:inputH3 value. Immunoprecipitation of DNA cross-linked to the Myc-Set1 was performed with 9E10 (anti-Myc)-agarose-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). ChIP experiments used to test the presence of methylated H3K4 were performed with anti-H3K4me (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-H3K4me2 and -H3K4me3 (Abcam). Set1C Composition and Roles of the Subunits—To analyze direct interactions within Set1C and interactions with Set1, we used a bacterial two-hybrid system based on the interactionmediated reconstruction of adenylate cyclase (36Karimova G. Dautin N. Ladant D. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 2233-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). The use of a bacterial two-hybrid system avoids the detection of indirect interactions between yeast proteins mediated by endogenous proteins acting as bridging molecules. In this assay, the proteins of interest were fused to two fragments (T25 and T18) of the catalytic domain of B. pertussis and co-expressed in an E. coli strain deficient for adenylate cyclase. Interaction of the two proteins resulted in a functional complementation between T25 and T18, leading to cAMP synthesis and in turn to transcriptional activation of catabolic operons, such as the lactose operon. The N terminus of Set1 (Set1-(1-283)), the double RNA recognition motif (RRM1-RRM2, Set1-(234-580)) (39Tresaugues L. Dehe P.M. Guerois R. Rodriguez-Gil A. Varlet I. Salah P. Pamblanco M. Luciano P. Quevillon-Cheruel S. Sollier J. Leulliot N. Couprie J. Tordera V. Zinn-Justin S. Chavez S. van Tilbeurgh H. Geli V. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1170-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and a large C-terminal domain (Set1-(580-1080)), as well as Bre2, Sdc1, Spp1, and Swd3 were cloned either into the T25 or T18 expression plasmids (or in both) to generate recombinant plasmids expressing hybrid proteins in which the polypeptides were fused at the C terminus of either the T25 or T18 fragment of the B. pertussis adenylate cyclase. The efficiencies of functional complementation were detected on McConkey and X-gal plates. In this assay, Bre2 and Sdc1 interact with each other, and Sdc1 also has the ability to interact with itself (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, the large C-terminal Set1-(580-1080) fragment interacts with Bre2 and Spp1. We examined the effect of each Set1C member on Set1 stability. Set1 protein levels were compared with Rap1 (as an internal control) by Western blots in strains lacking each of the nonessential Set1C subunits. We used anti-Set1 mouse monoclonal antibodies (14Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and anti-Rap1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies and two different secondary antibodies allowing the simultaneous direct infrared fluorescence detection of the Rap1 and Set1 antibodies (Fig. 1B). The amount of Set1 was similar to wild type in sdc1, bre2, and shg1 mutants. In swd1 and spp1 mutants, the amount of Set1 was reduced by 6- and 2-fold, respectively. Similar results were obtained in an experiment where TAP-tagged Set1 levels were evaluated by the detection of the TAP tag. In this experiment, deletion of either Swd1 or Swd3 reduced TAP-Set1 levels by >10-fold (data not shown). The expression of Set1 was also tested in several swd2 ts mutants (19Dichtl B. Aasland R. Keller W. RNA (Cold Spring Harbor). 2004; 10: 965-977Google Scholar). In all of the tested swd2 mutants, Set1 levels were reduced by >5-fold (not shown). We conclude that the Swd1-Swd3 heterodimer and Swd2 are required for Set1 stability and consequently for Set1C integrity. We next analyzed the protein complexes associated with TAP-tagged Set1 by mass spectrometry. Because the absence of Swd1 or Swd3 reduces Set1 stability, these experiments were only performed with strains lacking Bre2, Sdc1, Spp1 and Shg1 (Fig. 1C). In accordance with the existence of a Bre2-Sdc1 heteromer, the deletion of either abolishes the association of the other. However, the rest of the complex remained. Therefore, no other subunit requires Bre2-Sdc1 for association with Set1C. Furthermore, the complex does not require Bre2-Sdc1 for integrity. The absence of either of the two other deletable subunits, Spp1 or Shg1, did not destroy the complex, and all of the other subunits were still associated with Set1 (Fig. 1C). These results are in agreement with previous results showing that, in the absence of Set1, two heteromeric remnants of the complex, Swd1-Swd3 and Bre2-Sdc1, were found (2Roguev A. Schaft D. Shevchenko A. Pijnappel W.W. Wilm M. Aasland R. Stewart A.F. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7137-7148Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Interactions within the complex were further analyzed in a set1 strain in which endogenous Spp1 was TAP-tagged and a centromeric plasmid either expressed the full-length Set1 or the Set1-(1-900) fragment (1Briggs S.D. Bryk M. Strahl B.D. Cheung W.L. Davie J.K. Dent S.Y. Winston F. Allis C.D. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3286-3295Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). In both experiments, Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, and Shg1 were retrieved with Spp1-TAP (Fig. 1D), whereas Bre2 and Sdc1 were only retrieved when the full-length Set1 was expressed. Thus, the association of Spp1, Swd1, Swd2, Swd3, and Shg1 to Set1 do not depend on the C-terminal fragment Set1-(900-1080), whereas the association of Bre2 and Sdc1 requires the presence of Set1-(900-1080). Distinct Roles of Set1C Subunits in H3K4 Methylation—Lysines can be mono-, di-, or trimethylated. Previously, we developed a method to quantify the unmethylated and monomethylated forms of H3K4 on histones purified from S. cerevisiae by N-terminal sequencing of H3 (27Dehé P.M. Pamblanco M. Luciano P. Lebrun R. Moinier D. Sendra R. Verreault A. Tordera V. Géli V. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 353: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This method determines the ratio between the unmethylated and monomethylated H3K4 lysine by measuring the area under the K and Kme peaks at cycle 4 (Fig. 2A). Consequently, the amounts of di- and trimethylated H3K4 can be deduced (Table 1). Histones were purified from mutant strains disrupted for each one of the seven nonessential members of the Set1 complex. No peaks corresponding to monomethylation of H3K4 in the swd1 and swd3 mutants were detected. The bre2 and sdc1 mutants exhibited ∼50% of the wild-type monomethylation level, and the levels of di- and trimethylated H3K4 were reduced by ∼5-fold. The spp1 mutant did not affect monomethylation, and the di- and trimethylated H3K4 amount was reduced by ∼3-fold. Unexpectedly, the shg1 mutation provoked a small but reproducible increase of the di- and trimethylation H3K4 level and a slight reduction of the amount of unmethylated H3K4. Because N-terminal sequencing could not distinguish between di- and trimethylation, we analyzed these methylations by Western blot with H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 antibodies (Fig. 2B). For precision, these analyses were performed with purified histones (Fig. 2B). They agreed with and extended previous studies with whole-cell extracts (4Morillon A. Karabetsou N. Nair A. Mellor J. Mol. Cell. 2005; 18: 723-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 14Nagy P.L. Griesenbeck J. Kornberg R.D. Cleary M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Trimethylation was severely affected (but not abolished) in the bre2 and sdc1 mutants, whereas dimethylation was reduced by ∼4-fold. In the spp1 mutant, dimethylation was not affected; however, trimethylation was reduced by ∼3-fold.TABLE 1Quantification of histone H3 methylationStrainKme/KKKmeKme(2 + 3)%%%wt0.34491734set1010000swd1010000swd3010000bre20.088776sdc10.108596spp10.20721414shg10.34441541 Open table in a new tab Therefore, Set1C subunits can be grouped into four classes. 1) Swd1 and Swd3 form a heterodimer that is essential, together with Swd2, for Set1 stability and integrity of the complex and therefore for any H3K4 methylation. 2) Sdc1 and Bre2 form a heteromer that is required for trimethylation of H3K4 and efficient dimethylation but not for Set1C integrity. 3) Spp1 stabilizes Set1 and promotes efficient H3K4 trimethylation. 4) Shg1 seems to slightly inhibit H3K4 di- and trimethylation. Loss of Individual Set1C Subunits Differentially Affects the Distribution of H3K4 Methylation at the 5′ and 3′ Coding Regions of Active Genes—We looked for the effects caused by the loss of individual Set1C subunits on the distribution of Set1 protein as well as H3K4 methylation along the coding region of two active genes, RPL17A and CBF5. Results for both were similar; therefore, only CBF5 is presented (Fig. 3). To locate Set1, it was Myc-tagged at its N terminus. The tag did not interfere with the ability of Set1 to methylate H3K4 (27Dehé P.M. Pamblanco M. Luciano P. Lebrun R. Moinier D. Sendra R. Verreault A. Tordera V. Géli V. J. Mol.

Here we explored the contribution of mitochondria to neurodegeneration in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model of multiple sclerosis. Oxidative injury to the murine mitochondrion preceded the infiltration of inflammatory cells, classically heralded as the mediators of demyelination and axonal injury by transection. Nitration of mitochondrial proteins affected key subunits of complexes I and IV of the respiratory chain and a chaperone critical to the stabilization and translocation of proteins into the organelle. Oxidative products were associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and apoptotic cell death. Reductions in the rate of synthesis of adenosine triphosphate were severe and even greater than those associated with disorders caused by mutated mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial vacuolization, swelling, and dissolution of cristae occurred in axons as early as 3 days after sensitization for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Our findings implicate mitochondrial dysfunction induced by protein inactivation and mediated by oxidative stress initiates a cascade of molecular events leading to apoptosis and neurodegeneration in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis that is not mediated by inflammatory cells."

In the present study, we investigated and compared the hepatic lipid metabolisms of liver-specific Sod2 (superoxide dismutase 2) knock-out (Sod2 KO), Sod1 knock-out (Sod1 KO), and Sod1/liver-specific Sod2 double knock-out mice (double KO). We observed significant increases in lipid peroxidation and triglyceride (TG) in the liver of Sod1 KO and double KO mice but not in the liver of Sod2 KO mice. We also found that high fat diet enhanced fatty changes of the liver in Sod1 KO and double KO mice but not in Sod2 KO mice. These data indicated that CuZn-SOD deficiency caused lipid accumulation in the liver. To investigate the molecular mechanism of hepatic lipid accumulation in CuZn-SOD-deficient mice, we measured TG secretion rate from liver using Triton WR1339. We found significant decrease of TG secretion in CuZn-SOD-deficient mice. Furthermore, we observed marked degradation of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in the liver and plasma of CuZn-SOD-deficient mice, indicating that degradation of apoB impairs secretion of lipoprotein from the liver. Our data suggest that oxidative stress enhances hepatic lipid accumulation by impaired lipoprotein secretion due to the degradation of apoB in liver."

In particular, inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) 2The abbreviations used are: PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; β-lap, β-lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2b]pyran-5,6-dione); ROS, reactive oxygen species; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; MNNG, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; SSBs/DSBs, single/double-stranded DNA breaks; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; STS, staurosporine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferease-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; BAPTA-AM, (1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra-(acetoxymethyl ester)); Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DIC, dicoumarol; 3-AB, 3-aminobenzamide; DPQ, (3,4-dihydro-5[4-(1-piperindinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinoline); DCF, 6-carboxy-2′7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester); 231, MDA-MB-231; ns-shRNA, non-silencing shRNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 231-NQ-, MDA-MB-231-NQO1-negative; 231-NQ+, MDA-MB-231-NQO1-positive; PARG, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase; IR, ionizing radiation; Topo, topoisomerase; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase; TRMP, transient receptor potential-melastatin-like; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. 2The abbreviations used are: PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; β-lap, β-lapachone (3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2b]pyran-5,6-dione); ROS, reactive oxygen species; H2O2, hydrogen peroxide; MNNG, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine; SSBs/DSBs, single/double-stranded DNA breaks; PAR, poly(ADP-ribose); MMP, mitochondrial membrane potential; NQO1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1; STS, staurosporine; TUNEL, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferease-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling; BAPTA-AM, (1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra-(acetoxymethyl ester)); Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DIC, dicoumarol; 3-AB, 3-aminobenzamide; DPQ, (3,4-dihydro-5[4-(1-piperindinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinoline); DCF, 6-carboxy-2′7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester); 231, MDA-MB-231; ns-shRNA, non-silencing shRNA; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; 231-NQ-, MDA-MB-231-NQO1-negative; 231-NQ+, MDA-MB-231-NQO1-positive; PARG, poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase; IR, ionizing radiation; Topo, topoisomerase; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; PP2A, protein phosphatase 2A; PMCA, plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase; SERCA, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase; TRMP, transient receptor potential-melastatin-like; AIF, apoptosis-inducing factor. that sensitize cells to DNA-damaging agents are under extensive investigation (2Calabrese C.R. Almassy R. Barton S. Batey M.A. Calvert A.H. Canan-Koch S. Durkacz B.W. Hostomsky Z. Kumpf R.A. Kyle S. Li J. Maegley K. Newell D.R. Notarianni E. Stratford I.J. Skalitzky D. Thomas H.D. Wang L.Z. Webber S.E. Williams K.J. Curtin N.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2004; 96: 56-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). PARP-1 functions as a DNA damage sensor that responds to both single- and/or double-strand DNA breaks (SSBs, DSBs), facilitating DNA repair and cell survival. After binding to DNA breaks, PARP-1 converts β-NAD+ (NAD+) into polymers of branched or linear poly(ADP-ribose) units (PAR) and attaches them to various nuclear acceptor proteins, including XRCC1, histones, and PARP-1 for its autoregulation (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). However, in response to extensive DNA damage, PARP-1 can be hyperactivated, eliciting rapid cellular NAD+ and ATP pool depletion. PARP-1-mediated NAD+ and ATP losses have affects on mitochondrial function by decreasing the levels of pyruvate and NADH. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) ensues, causing caspase-independent cell death by as yet unknown mechanisms (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). PARP-1 hyperactivation was documented in the cellular response to trauma, such as ischemia-reperfusion, myocardial infarction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced injury (3Kim M.Y. Zhang T. Kraus W.L. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 1951-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). In each case, inhibition of PARP-1 was necessary for the long-term survival of damaged cells (4Jagtap P. Szabo C. Nat. Rev. Drug. Discov. 2005; 4: 421-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). β-lapachone (β-lap) elicits a unique cell death process in various human breast, lung, and prostate cancers that have elevated levels of the two-electron oxidoreductase, NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) (EC 1.6.99.2) (5Pink J.J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). β-lap induces an NQO1-dependent form of cell death wherein PARP-1 and p53 proteolytic cleavage fragments were noted (6Pink J.J. Wuerzberger-Davis S. Tagliarino C. Planchon S.M. Yang X. Froelich C.J. Boothman D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), concomitant with μ-calpain activation (7Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Reinicke K.E. Simmers S.M. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Boothman D.A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). β-lap-induced lethality and proteolysis were abrogated by dicoumarol (an NQO1 inhibitor), and were muted in cells deficient in NQO1 enzymatic activity (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Restoration of NQO1 caused increases in drug sensitivity (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). In contrast to staurosporine (STS), global caspase inhibitors had little effect on β-lap lethality (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). β-lap-mediated cell death exhibited classical features of apoptosis (e.g. DNA condensation, trypan blue exclusion, sub-G0-G1 cells, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells). β-lap cell death was not, however, dependent on typical apoptotic mediators, such as p53 or caspases (8Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar). To date, the mechanisms responsible for the initiation of this unique cell death have not been delineated. We report that β-lap induces an NQO1-dependent, PARP-1-mediated cell death pathway involving changes in cellular metabolism leading to cell death. NQO1-dependent reduction of β-lap results in a futile redox cycle between the parent β-lap molecule and its hydroquinone form (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), wherein ROS generation causes extensive DNA damage, H2AX phosphorylation (γ-H2AX) and PARP-1 hyperactivation. Drastic decreases in NAD+ and ATP pools, in turn, inhibit DNA repair and accelerate cell death. In addition, chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by 1,2-bis-(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetra-acetoxymethyl ester (BAPTA-AM) abrogates β-lap-induced: (i) γ-H2AX formation, (ii) PARP-1 hyperactivation, (iii) atypical PARP-1 and p53 proteolysis, and (iv) cytotoxicity without affecting NQO1-dependent ROS production. A similar Ca2+-sensitive cell death is observed after hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) exposure. Interestingly, N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced PARP-1 hyperactivation is not sensitive to BAPTA-AM. These data support a critical role for Ca2+ as a regulator of cellular metabolism in response to ROS-induced DNA damage. Reagents—β-lap was synthesized by Dr. William G. Bornmann (MD Anderson), dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) at 40 mm, and the concentration verified by spectrophotometric analyses (8Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar). β-lap stocks were stored at -80 °C. Hoechst 33258, 3-aminobenzamide (3-AB), dicoumarol (DIC), H2O2, STS, and MNNG were obtained from Sigma. BAPTA-AM was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 5 μm unless otherwise stated. DPQ (3,4-dihydro-5[4-(1-piperindinyl)butoxy]-1(2H)-isoquinoline) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 20 μm. DPQ and BAPTA-AM were obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Z-VAD-fmk was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Dublin, CA), diluted in Me2SO and used at 50 μm. DCF was dissolved in Me2SO and used at 5 μm to monitor ROS formation. DCF was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—Human MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468-NQ+ breast cancer cells were maintained and used as described (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Human MDA-MB-231 (231) breast cancer cells that contain a 609C>T polymorphism in NQO1 (9Ross D. Kepa J.K. Winski S.L. Beall H.D. Anwar A. Siegel D. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2000; 129: 77-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) and are deficient in enzyme activity, were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cells were stably transfected with a CMV-driven NQO1 cDNA or the pcDNA3 vector alone as described (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). All cells were grown in high glucose-containing RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air humidified atmosphere (6Pink J.J. Wuerzberger-Davis S. Tagliarino C. Planchon S.M. Yang X. Froelich C.J. Boothman D.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 255: 144-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). 231-NQO1+ (NQ+) and -NQO1 (NQ-) cells were maintained in medium containing 400 μg/ml geneticin (8Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar), but all experiments were performed without selection. All tissue culture components were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA) unless otherwise stated. All cells were routinely tested and found free of myco-plasma contamination. PARP-1 Knockdown—A puromycin-selectable-pSHAG-MAGIC2 retroviral vector containing a short hairpin small interfering RNA against PARP-1 (PARP-1-shRNA) and a non-silencing sequence (ns-shRNA) control were used to infect both NQ+ and NQ-231 cells (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, AL). Cells were then selected and grown in 0.5 μg/ml puromycin and screened for PARP-1 protein expression and NQO1 enzymatic activity. Relative Survival Assays—Relative survival assays were performed as previously described (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were pretreated or not with BAPTA-AM (5 μm, 30 min) then treated with or without 2-h pulses of β-lap at the doses indicated, in the presence or absence of 40 μm dicoumarol. In some experiments, cells were exposed to 5 μm β-lap followed by delayed (t = 0-2 h) addition of 5 μm BAPTA-AM. After drug addition, media were removed and drug-free media added. Cells were then allowed to grow for an additional 6 days and relative survival, based on DNA content (Hoechst 33258 staining), was determined (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Prior studies using β-lap showed that relative survival assays correlated directly with colony forming ability assays (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Data were expressed as treated/control (T/C) from separate triplicate experiments (means, ± S.E.), and comparisons analyzed using a two-tailed Student's t test for paired samples. Immunoblotting and Confocal Microscopy—Western blots were prepared as previously described (8Wuerzberger S.M. Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Byers K.L. Bornmann W.G. Boothman D.A. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1876-1885PubMed Google Scholar). α-PARP (sc-8007) and α-p53 (DO-1) antibodies were utilized at dilutions of 1:1000 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The α-PAR antibody was used at 1:2000 dilution (BD-Pharmingen, San Jose, CA). Antibodies to total levels of H2AX or γ-H2AX were used at dilutions of 1:100-1:500 and purchased from Bethyl Laboratories (Montgomery, TX) and Upstate (Charlottesville, VA), respectively. An NQO1 antibody was generated and used directly for immunoblot analyses in medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× phosphate-buffered saline, and 0.2% Tween 20 (10Siegel D. Franklin W.A. Ross D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1998; 4: 2065-2070PubMed Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed as previously described (7Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Reinicke K.E. Simmers S.M. Wuerzberger-Davis S.M. Boothman D.A. Cancer Biol. Ther. 2003; 2: 141-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) and incubated with α-PAR (10H; Alexis, San Diego, CA) or α-γ-H2AX (Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) for 2 h at room temperature. Nuclei were visualized by Hoechst 33258 staining at a 1:3000 dilution. Confocal images were collected at 488 nm excitation from a krypton/argon laser using a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY). Images were representative of experiments performed at least four times. The number of PAR-positive cells and γ-H2AX foci/cell were quantified by counting 60 or more cells from four independent experiments (means ± S.E.). Formation of ROS was monitored by the conversion of non-fluorescent 6-carboxy-2′7′-dichlorodihy-drofluorescin diacetate, di(acetoxymethyl ester) to fluorescent 6-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate di(acetoxymethyl ester) (DCF) as previously described (11Nieminen A.L. Byrne A.M. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1286-C1294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Dawson T.L. Gores G.J. Nieminen A.L. Herman B. Lemasters J.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C961-C967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MCF-7 cells were seeded at 2-3 × 105 cells in 35-mm glass bottom Petri dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were loaded with 5 μm DCF in media for 30 min at 37 °C. After loading, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated for an additional 20 min at 37 °C to allow for dye de-esterification. Confocal images of DCF fluorescence were collected using 488-nm excitation from an argon/krypton laser, 560-nm dichroic mirror, and a 500-550 nm band pass filter. Three basal images were collected before drug addition (5-8 μm β-lap, +5 μm BAPTA-AM or 40 μm dicoumarol). Subsequent images were taken after the indicated treatments at 15-s intervals and similar results were found at 37 °C or rm. temp. BAPTA-AM was co-loaded with DCF where indicated. Mean pixel intensities were determined in regions of interest for at least 40 individual cells at each time point. Shown are representative traces of at least three independent experiments (means ± S.E.). Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis (Alkaline Comet) Assays—DNA damage was assessed after different drug treatments by evaluating DNA “comet” tail area and migration distance (13Olive P.L. Banath J.P. Durand R.E. Radiat. Res. 1990; 122: 86-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (1128) Google Scholar). MCF-7 cells were pretreated with BAPTA-AM (5 μm, 30 min) or Me2SO (1:1000 dilution), and then exposed to H2O2 (500 μm, 1 h), β-lap (4 μm, various times), or vehicle alone, and harvested at various times. Cell suspensions (3 × 105/ml cold PBS) were mixed with 1% low melting temperature agarose (1:10 (v/v)) at 37 °C and immediately transferred onto a CometSlide™ (Trevigen). After solidifying (30 min at 4 °C), slides were submerged in prechilled lysis buffer (2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm EDTA pH 10, 10 mm Tris Base, 1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate, and 1% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 45 min, incubated in alkaline unwinding solution (300 mm NaOH, and 1 mm EDTA) for 45 min at room temperature and washed twice (5 min) in neutral 1× TBE (89.2 mm Tris Base, 89 mm boric acid, and 2.5 mm EDTA disodium salt). Damaged and undamaged nuclear DNA was then separated by electrophoresis in 1× TBE for 10 min at 1 V/cm, fixed in 70% ethanol, and stained using SYBR-green (Trevigen). Comets were visualized using an Olympus fluorescence microscope (Melville, NY), and images captured using a digital camera. Images were analyzed using ImageJ software (14Abramoff M.D. Magelhaes P.J. Ram S.J. Biophotonics Int. 2004; 11: 36-42Google Scholar, 15Rasband W. Image J. Int.,. 1997-2005; (Bethesda, MD)Google Scholar) and comet tail length was calculated as the distance between the end of nuclei heads and the end of each tail. Tail moments were defined as the product of the %DNA in each tail, and the distance between the mean of the head and tail distributions in Equation 1, %DNA(tail)=TA×TAI×100/(TA×TAI)+[HA×HAI](Eq. 1) where TA is the tail area, TAI is the tail area intensity, HA is the head area, and HAI is the head area intensity. Importantly, tail moment and tail area calculations yielded similar experimental results. Each datum point represented the average of 100 cells ± S.E., and data are representative of experiments performed three times. Determination of NAD+ and ATP Levels—Intracellular NAD+ levels were measured as described (16Jacobson E.L. Jacobson M.K. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 280: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) with modification. Briefly, cells were seeded at 1 × 106 and allowed to attach overnight. Cells were pretreated for 2 h with 3-AB (25 mm), DPQ (20 μm), BAPTA-AM (5 μm), or Me2SO and then exposed to β-lap (2-20 μm) for the indicated times. Cell extracts were prepared in 0.5 m perchloric acid, neutralized (1 m KOH, 0.33 m KH2PO4/K2HPO4 (pH 7.5)), and centrifuged to remove KClO4 precipitates. Supernatants or NAD+ standards were incubated 4:1 (v/v) for 20 min at 37 °C with NAD+ reaction mixture as described (17Zong W.X. Ditsworth D. Bauer D.E. Wang Z.Q. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1272-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Measurements from extracts were taken at an absorbance of 570 nm and intracellular NAD+ levels were normalized to 1 × 106 cells. Data were expressed as %NAD+ ± S.E., for T/C samples from nine individual experiments. ATP levels were analyzed using a luciferase-based bioluminescence assay as described (18Beigi R.D. Dubyak G.R. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7189-7198Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data were graphed as means ± S.E. of experiments performed at least three times. Results were compared using the two-tailed Student's t test for paired samples. NQO1 Enzyme Activity Assays—NQO1 enzymatic assays were performed as described (19Fitzsimmons S.A. Workman P. Grever M. Paull K. Camalier R. Lewis A.D. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 259-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) using cytochrome c (practical grade, Sigma) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.5). NADH (200 μm) was the immediate electron donor, and menadione (10 μm) the electron acceptor. Changes in absorbance were monitored using a Beckman DU 640 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Dicoumarol (10 μm) inhibitable NQO1 levels were calculated as nmol of cytochrome c reduced/min/μg protein based on initial rate of change in absorbance at 550 nm and an extinction coefficient for cytochrome c of 21.1 nmol/liter/cm (20Hollander P.M. Ernster L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1975; 169: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Results were expressed as means ± S.E. of three or more separate experiments. Flow Cytometry and Apoptotic Measurements—Flow cytometric analyses of TUNEL-positive cells were performed as described using APO-DIRECT™ (BD Pharmingen) (5Pink J.J. Planchon S.M. Tagliarino C. Varnes M.E. Siegel D. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5416-5424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Samples were analyzed in an EPICS Elite ESP flow cytometer using an air-cooled argon laser at 488 nm, 15 milliwatt (Beckman Coulter Electronics, Miami, FL) and Elite acquisition software. Experiments were performed a minimum of five times, and data expressed as means ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed using a two-tailed Student's t test for paired samples. Glutathione Measurements—Disulfide glutathione and total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) levels were determined using a spectrophotometric recycling assay (21Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C.

Following indicated treatments, pellets were thawed and whole cell homogenates prepared as described (21Lee Y.J. Galoforo S.S. Berns C.M. Chen J.C. Davis B.H. Sim J.E. Corry P.M. Spitz D.R. J. Biol.

Data were expressed as the %GSSG normalized to protein content, as measured using the method of Lowry et al. (23Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol.

Time and Ca2+ Dependence of β-lap-induced Cell Death—To elucidate the signaling events required for β-lap-induced cell death, log-phase human MCF-7 breast cancer cells, with high levels of endogenous NQO1 activity, were tested for their sensitivities to various concentrations of β-lap at various times. The purpose of these experiments was to determine the minimal time of β-lap exposure required to kill the entire cell population. Cells exposed to doses of ≤3 μm β-lap required ≥4hto elicit cell death, whereas 2 h exposures of β-lap at ≥4 μm killed all MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). Prior data from our laboratory demonstrated that Ca2+ was released within 2-5 min from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ stores after β-lap treatment (24Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Dubyak G.R. Nieminen A.L. Boothman D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19150-19159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), suggesting that this was a required initiating factor in β-lap-induced cell death (24Tagliarino C.

To test this, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with the intracellular Ca2+ chelator BAPTA-AM (5 μm, 30 min), then exposed to 4 μm β-lap for various times (Fig. 1B). Under these conditions, we previously demonstrated that BAPTA-AM pretreatment was sufficient to block the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by β-lap treatment (24Tagliarino C. Pink J.J. Dubyak G.R.

BAPTA-AM abrogated β-lap-induced cytotoxicity and nuclear condensation (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). To determine the kinetics of Ca2+-dependent cell death, MCF-7 cells were treated with 5 μm β-lap, and 5 μm BAPTA-AM was added at various times thereafter, up to 2 h. A time-dependent decrease in survival was observed with delayed addition of BAPTA-AM (Fig. 1C), indicating that Ca2+ release was a necessary event, occurring before cells were committed to death. Abrogation of β-lap cytotoxicity by BAPTA-AM was equivalent to that noted with NQO1 inhibition by dicoumarol (Fig. 1B). Addition of BAPTA-AM also prevented β-lap-induced, atypical proteolysis (e.g. ∼60 kDa PARP-1 and p53 cleavage fragments), in a manner as effective as dicoumarol (supplemental Fig. S1B, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, Z-VAD-fmk (50 μm), a pan-caspase inhibitor, did not block atypical PARP-1 and p53 proteolysis in β-lap-treated MCF-7 cells (lane 7). As expected, Z-VAD-fmk inhibited STS (1 μm)-induced caspase-mediated proteolysis (25Jacobsen M.D. Weil M. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1041-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). However, BAPTA-AM did not affect STS-induced apoptotic proteolysis (supplemental Fig. S1C). These data, in conjunction with our prior data showing β-lap-induced ER Ca2+ release (24Tagliarino C.

PARP-1 Hyperactivation after β-lap Treatment Is NQO1-dependent and BAPTA-AM-sensitive—Because β-lap-induced cell death was accompanied by a ≥80% loss of ATP within 1 h (24Tagliarino C. Pink J.J.

Chem. 2001; 276: 19150-19159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), we suspected PARP-1 hyperactivation played a role in the mode of action for this drug. To investigate this, we generated 231 NQO1-proficient (231-NQ+) cells that are sensitive to β-lap (LD50: ∼1.5 μm), after a 2-h pulse, and compared these cells to vector alone, 231 NQO1-deficient (231-NQ-) cells, that are resistant to the drug (LD50: 17.5 μm). Only β-lap-treated, 231-NQ+ cells exhibited an increase in PAR-modified proteins, mostly PARP-1, consistent with the role of PARP-1 as the predominant poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated species. This response peaked ∼30 min during β-lap exposure (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment of 231-NQ-cells with equal or significantly higher doses of β-lap did not induce PAR accumulation (data not shown). In contrast, both 231-NQ+ and 231-NQ-cells hyperactivated PARP-1 in response to H2O2. The NQO1-dependence of PARP-1 hyperactivation after β-lap exposure was confirmed in a number of other cell lines (e.g. breast, prostate, and lung cancers) that have elevated NQO1 activity demonstrating that the respon"

Although previous studies suggest that β-catenin may be involved in the process of preconditioning and healing after myocardial infarction (MI), little is known regarding the role of β-catenin in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. We investigated the role of β-catenin in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and whether β-catenin overexpression could reduce MI size. Adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of nonphosphorylatable constitutively active β-catenin (Ad-catenin) decreased apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts with increased expression of survivin and Bcl-2. Although Ad-catenin increased the percentage of cells in the S phase with enhanced expression of cyclin D1 and E2 in both cell types, the increase in cell number was only evident in cardiac fibroblasts, whereas hypertrophy and binuclear cells were more prominent in cardiomyocytes. All of these effects of β-catenin gene transfer were blocked by inhibition of its nuclear translocation. Furthermore, Ad-catenin enhanced the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in both cells and induced differentiation of cardiac fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. In a rat MI model, injection of Ad-catenin into the infarct border zone resulted in a significantly decreased MI size with anti-apoptotic effect and cell cycle activation in both cardiomyocytes and myofibroblasts. β-Catenin may play an important role in the healing process after MI by promoting survival and cell cycle not only in cardiomyocytes but also in cardiac fibroblasts with its differentiation into myofibroblasts. β-Catenin is a transcriptional regulator of several genes involved in survival and proliferation.

Membranebound β-catenin maintains tissue architecture and cell polarity at adherens junctions by linking the cadherin cytoplasmic tail to the actin cytoskeleton (1Conacci-Sorrell M. Zhurinsky J. Ben-Ze'ev A. J. Clin. Investig. 2002; 109: 987-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Cytoplasmic β-catenin translocates into the nucleus where it forms a complex with transcription factors of Tcf/Lef family and activates the expression of specific genes involved in cell survival and proliferation (1Conacci-Sorrell M.

Polakis P. Science. 2000; 287: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). Although the critical roles of β-catenin during development (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2225) Google Scholar) and in neoplastic disease have been well described previously (6Polakis P. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1837-1851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the role of β-catenin in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, which are not only the principal cells comprising the myocardium but also key cells involved in remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI). Recent studies have suggested that β-catenin is capable of regulating survival/apoptosis and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (7Bergmann M.W. Rechner C. Freund C. Baurand A. El Jamali A. Dietz R. J.

The inactivation of GSK3β by statins has been shown to inhibit cardiomyocyte apoptosis (7Bergmann M.W. Rechner C. Freund C. Baurand A. El Jamali A. Dietz R. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2004; 37: 681-690Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), whereas activated GSK3β was shown to attenuate cardiac hypertrophy in vivo (8Antos C.L. McKinsey T.A. Frey N. Kutschke W. McAnally J. Shel-ton J.M. Richardson J.A. Hill J.A. Olson E.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). In addition, Wnt/β-catenin pathways have also been implicated in fibroblast proliferation (9Yun M.S. Kim S.E. Jeon S.H. Lee J.S. Choi K.Y. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Wnt-1 induced accumulation of cytosolic β-catenin, and the resultant Tcf/Lef transcriptional activation was correlated with enhanced proliferation, survival, and growth in Rat-1 fibroblasts (10Young C.S. Masckauchan T.N. Kitajewski J. Differentiation. 2003; 71: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Taken together, previous data suggest that β-catenins enhance survival, growth, and proliferation in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts and may play a role in the healing process after MI. The modulation of upstream signals of β-catenin in the myocardial ischemia model has been investigated previously. These studies suggest that β-catenin may have a role in the process of preconditioning and healing after myocardial infarction. Inactivation of GSK3β reduced MI size (11Tong H. Imahashi K. Steenbergen C. Murphy E. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 377-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and resulted in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytosol and nucleus in a preconditioning model (12Kaga S. Zhan L. Altaf E. Maulik N. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2006; 40: 138-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Overexpression of FrzA, an antagonist of the Wnt pathway, induced the activation of GSK3β and reversed the benefit of ischemic preconditioning after MI (13Barandon L. Dufourcq P. Costet P. Moreau C. Allieres C. Daret D. Dos Santos P. Daniel Lamaziere J.M. Couffinhal T. Duplaa C. Circ. Res. 2005; 96: 1299-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). On the other hand, overexpression of FrzA reduced MI size and improved cardiac function in a non-reperfused model (14Barandon L. Couffinhal T. Ezan J. Dufourcq P. Costet P. Alzieu P. Leroux L. Moreau C. Dare D. Duplaa C. Circulation. 2003; 108: 2282-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In these studies, myocardial ischemia models were different, and none of these studies overexpressed β-catenin directly. The direct modulation of β-catenin may more clearly suggest that β-catenin plays a pivotal role in the healing process after MI. Therefore, the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of β-catenin in myocardial healing after infarction. We investigated and compared the role of β-catenin in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts along with the downstream signaling pathway of β-catenin. To confirm that the effects observed were mediated by the transcriptional activity of β-catenin, nuclear translocation of β-catenin was inhibited. Furthermore, we studied the effect of direct β-catenin overexpression in a rat MI model. Construction of Adenoviral Vectors Expressing Triple Mutant β-Catenin—Adenoviruses expressing the triple mutant β-catenin construct were produced using AdEasy™ kits (Qbiogene, Inc.). Human wild type β-catenin plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein of The Johns Hopkins University. To overexpress β-catenin, we produced a β-catenin triple mutant plasmid using PCR-based targeted mutagenesis, which contains three mutations in phosphorylation sites (S33Y/S37F/T41A) resulting in resistance to degradation by GSK3β. β-Catenin triple mutant plasmid was subcloned into a shuttle vector (pAdTrack-CMV). The recombinant shuttle vector was cotransfected with the adenoviral genome (pAdEasy-1) containing green fluorescence protein (GFP) gene into Escherichia coli (BJ5183) where homologous recombination occurred. The recombinant adenovirus β-catenin triple mutant (Ad-catenin) was transfected to 293a cells (Microbix Biosystem Inc.) to amplify viral particles, which were purified by CsCl (Sigma) ultracentrifugation and dialysis. Successful construction of Adcatenin was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of β-catenin, and transfected cells were determined by the coexpression of GFP. Hemagglutinin was tagged to the adenoviral vector, indicating exogenous β-catenin. Adenovirus encoding GFP (Ad-GFP) was used as control. Inhibition of β-Catenin-mediated Transcription Activation by Cadherin Derivatives—Dominant negative N-cadherin (NCadΔC), which lacks most of the extracellular domain, was used to suppress β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity (15Shin C.S. Her S.J. Kim J.A. Kim D.H. Kim S.W. Kim S.Y. Kim H.S. Park K.H. Kim J.G. Kitazawa R. Cheng S.L. Civitelli R. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2005; 20: 2200-2212Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The NCadΔC construct was obtained from Dr. C. S. Shin with the permission of Dr. Jeffrey Gordon (Washington University, St. Louis). NCadΔC was inserted into the BglII/EcoRI site of pMSCV-IRES-GFP retroviral vector, giving pMSCV-NCadΔC-IRES-GFP. 293T cells were transfected with the retroviral vectors pMSCV-NCadΔC-IRES-HA-GFP or control empty vector, pMSCV-IRES-GFP, using Lipofectamine Plus reagents (Invitrogen). Viral supernatant was collected 48 h later, centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 5 min, and stored at -80 °C. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were transfected with the retroviral vectors before adenoviral transfection to block β-catenin-mediated transcriptional activity. Primary Cell Cultures from Neonatal Rat Hearts—Primary cultures of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were prepared as described previously (16Thaik C.M. Calderone A. Takahashi N. Colucci W.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 96: 1093-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2-day-old Fisher 344 rats were euthanized, and hearts were excised and washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (Sigma). Ventricles were minced and trypsinized. After centrifugation, cell pellets were resuspended. Floating cardiomyocytes and attached fibroblasts were separated. To confirm adequate separation, cardiomyocytes were stained with anti-troponin T (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and fibroblasts with an anti-fibroblast-specific marker (AF5110-1; Acris) (data not shown). Cell Viability and Proliferation Assays—Cell viability and proliferation were measured using WST-1 (WST; high watersoluble tetrazolium salt; Roche Applied Science) assay and incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts were seeded in 96-well plates at 2 × 104 cells per well in DMEM (Invitrogen) and transfected with retroviral vectors and recombinant adenoviral vectors (100 multiplicities of infection). Cells were then placed in 0.5% FBS for 40 h or in 1 μm staurosporine, a strong inducer of apoptosis, for 24 h to measure apoptosis or in 10% FBS for 40 h to measure proliferation. At the end of the incubation period, 10 μl/well of WST-1 or BrdUrd was added and incubated for another 4 h in the same incubator. Flow Cytometry—Apoptosis and cell cycle status were evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS), as described previously (17Yang H.M. Kim H.S. Park K.W. You H.J. Jeon S.I. Youn S.W. Kim S.H. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Walsh K. Circulation. 2004; 110: 301-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with retroviral vectors and 100 multiplicities of infection of recombinant adenoviral vectors and then placed in 0.5 or 10% FBS. Cells were harvested and fixed at 40 h for analysis of apoptosis and cell cycle progression. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACStar Plus (BD Biosciences). Histograms of DNA contents were analyzed using Modfit LT software (Verity Software) to characterize population fractions in each phase of the cell cycle. Assessment of Ploidity, Protein Synthesis, and Hypertrophy—Cell cycle distribution of DNA content was determined by flow cytometry as described previously (18Gualberto A. Aldape K. Kozakiewicz K. Tlsty T.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5166-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Flow cytometry was carried out using a Coulter Elite ESP flow cytometer and analyzed using CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For each analysis, 104 cells were analyzed. [3H]Leucine incorporation was carried out as described previously (19Rogers J.H. Tamirisa P. Kovacs A. Weinheimer C. Courtois M. Blumer K.J. Kelly D.P. Muslin A.J. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were made quiescent by incubation in 0.5% FBS for 24 h. The cells were then placed in 10% FBS for 40 h. Four hours before harvesting, [3H]leucine (1 μCi/ml) (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was added to the media. [3H]Leucine incorporation was determined using an LS 3801 scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments). Cell hypertrophy was analyzed as described previously (20Rommel C. Bodine S.C. Clarke B.A. Rossman R. Nunez L. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Glass D.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1009-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). Cell area was quantified from images of unstained cells as follows: 10 fields were chosen randomly, and 10 cells were measured per field. Western Blotting—Immunoblot assays were performed as described previously (21Choi J.H. Hur J. Yoon C.H. Kim J.H. Lee C.S. Youn S.W. Oh I.Y. Skurk C. Murohara T. Park Y.B. Walsh K. Kim H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49430-49438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The primary antibodies used were anti-total β-catenin antibody (1:500 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.), anti-survivin antibody (1:500 dilution; Novus), anti-Bcl-2 antibody (1:1000; Pharmingen) anti-cyclin D1 antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anticyclin E2 antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-VEGF antibody (1:500 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-α-tubulin antibody (1:500 dilution; Oncogene). The secondary antibody was anti-mouse IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (1:2500 dilution; Amersham Biosciences). MI Model and Adenovirus-mediated Gene Transfer—Female Sprague-Dawley rats (12 weeks old), weighing 220-250 g (Daehan Biolink Co.), were fed and given water ad libitum. All animal experiments were performed after receiving approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Clinical Research Institute in Seoul National University Hospital, and all protocols complied with the National Research Council. Myocardial infarction was induced in rats as described previously (22Youn T.J. Piao H. Kwon J.S. Choi S.Y. Kim H.S. Park D.G. Kim D.W. Kim Y.G. Cho M.C. Eur. J. Heart Fail. 2002; 4: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Either Ad-catenin or Ad-GFP was injected to the infracted area and the MI border zone. Echocardiographic Studies—The rats were anesthetized, and echocardiographic examination was performed. Left ventricular end diastolic dimension (LVEDD), left ventricular end systolic dimension (LVESD), and anterior wall thickness (ATW) were measured from at least three consecutive cardiac cycles on the M-mode tracings, based upon the American Society for Echocardiography leading edge method. Fractional shortening (FS) was calculated as (LVEDD-LVESD)/LVEDD × 100. Histologic Analysis and Immunohistochemistry—At 7 days after MI, rats were euthanized by pentobarbital overdose. Infarct size was determined by image analysis system (Scion Image, Scion Corp.) on Masson's trichrome-stained slides. The infarct area was measured in five different sections from each animal. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously (23Park K.W. Yang H.M. Youn S.W. Yang H.J. Chae I.H. Oh B.H. Lee M.M. Park Y.B. Choi Y.S. Kim H.S. Walsh K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1364-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The heart was excised, embedded in OCT compound, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. To evaluate apoptosis, the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was performed. TUNEL-positive cells were counted in 10 different microscopic fields of at least three different sections from each animal. Immunofluorescent staining was performed as described previously with minor modifications (24Cho H.J. Youn S.W. Cheon S.I. Kim T.Y. Hur J. Zhang S.Y. Lee S.P. Park K.W. Lee M.M. Choi Y.S. Park Y.B. Kim H.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 1154-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sections were washed, fixed, and incubated with monoclonal antibodies against hemagglutinin, platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 (Pharmingen) for capillary density, proliferating cell-nuclear antigen (PCNA), troponin T, cyclin D1 (Cell Signaling Technology), and cyclin E (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 30 min at room temperature. Afterward, cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes), conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The fluorescent image was obtained with a fluorescence microscope (Axiovert 200 microscope; Carl Zeiss). PECAM-1 positive cells were counted in 10 different microscopic fields of at least three different sections from each animal. Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons of means were performed using the Student t test or analysis of variance test with Bonferroni post hoc test. All calculations were performed using the SPSS software version 11.0, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Confirmation of Adenoviral Construct and Successful Gene Transfer and Confirmation of Retroviral Vector—After transfection of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts with adenoviral vectors, we confirmed GFP expression in more than 95% of the cells. Ad-catenin transfection resulted in overexpression of total β-catenin on Western blotting analysis in contrast to Ad-GFP, which showed no changes in β-catenin expression, confirming successful formation of Ad-catenin construct and gene transfer. After retroviral transfection, we confirmed GFP expression in about 70% of the cells, both in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts. β-Catenin Reduces Apoptosis in Cardiomyocytes and Cardiac Fibroblasts—Under serum deprivation, the subdiploid apoptotic fraction of DNA as measured by flow cytometry analysis significantly decreased in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts transfected with Ad-catenin compared with Ad-GFP-transfected cells, which was reversed by NCadΔC (Fig. 1, A and C). Accordingly, WST-1 assay showed a significantly enhanced cell viability in Ad-catenin-transfected cells compared with Ad-GFP-transfected cells (absorption: 135 ± 12% versus 100 ± 12% in cardiomyocytes and 148 ± 2% versus 100 ± 10% cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 1, B and D), which was inhibited by NCadΔC. When challenged by staurosporine, Ad-catenin also enhanced cell viability (absorption: 129 ± 11% versus 100 ± 1% in cardiomyocytes and 123 ± 1% versus 100 ± 2% cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 1, B and D). To investigate the possible downstream mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effect of β-catenin overexpression, we examined survivin and Bcl-2, anti-apoptotic proteins. The expression of survivin and Bcl-2 increased after Ad-catenin transfection, which was also inhibited by NCadΔC (Fig. 1, E and F). Immunofluorescent staining confirmed that Bcl-2 protein was increased in the Adcatenin group compared with the Ad-GFP group (supplemental Fig.). Collectively, β-catenin overexpression enhanced cell survival in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, and survivin and Bcl-2 are the downstream molecules to mediate the antiapoptotic effect of β-catenin in these cells. β-Catenin Propagates the Cell Cycle but Increases Cell Number Only in Cardiac Fibroblasts and Not in Cardiomyocytes—Analysis of BrdUrd incorporation into DNA showed an increase in DNA synthesis in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, which was completely inhibited by NCadΔC (absorption, 126 ± 9% versus 100 ± 6% in cardiomyocytes and 151 ± 9% versus 100 ± 5% cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 2A). However, although the viable cell number increased in cardiac fibroblast after β-catenin transfection and subsequently decreased after NCadΔC transfection, there were no significant effects on the viable cell number of cardiomyocytes (absorption, 103 ± 5% versus 100 ± 3% in cardiomyocytes and 138 ± 6% versus 100 ± 3% cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 2B), suggesting that β-catenin does not induce cellular division in cardiomyocytes even though it induced DNA replication. To investigate the differential effect of β-catenin on the DNA replication and cell proliferation of cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, we examined the cell cycle and DNA content. Ad-catenin increased the percentage of cells in the S phase in both cells (Fig. 2, C and D), concordant with the increased BrdUrd incorporation. To investigate the mechanism of cell cycle propagation after β-catenin overexpression, major regulators of G1-S transition, cyclin D1 and E2, were examined. In accordance with the increase in cells in the S phase, the expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin E2 increased in both cells transfected with Ad-catenin, which was reversed by NCadΔC (Fig. 2, E and F). Because the number of cardiomyocytes was unchanged despite increased DNA synthesis, we examined the effects of β-catenin gene transfer on nuclear polyploidization and cellular hypertrophy. Ad-catenin resulted in an increase in the fraction of cells greater than 4 n DNA content compared with Ad-GFP, which was reversed by NCadΔC (Fig. 3, A and B). However, the increase in ploidity by β-catenin overexpression was more prominent in cardiomyocytes than in cardiac fibroblasts. Moreover, binuclear cells were more frequently observed in cardiomyocytes transfected with Ad-catenin compared with Ad-GFP but not in cardiac fibroblasts. In fibroblasts, cell size also increased, but to a lesser degree than cardiomyocytes, and binuclear cells were observed less frequently than in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 3, C and D). Analysis of [3H]leucine incorporation to protein demonstrated an increase in protein synthesis in both cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts, which was inhibited by NCadΔC (183 ± 6% versus 100 ± 1% in cardiomyocytes and 163 ± 1% versus 100 ± 5% cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.01; Fig. 3E). Accordingly, the effect of β-catenin on hypertrophy was more prominent in cardiomyocytes than in cardiac fibroblasts. Ad-catenin transfection induced a greater increase in cell size in cardiomyocytes compared with cardiac fibroblasts, which was reversed by NCadΔC (1.7 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 in cardiomyocytes and 1.3 ± 0.1 versus 1.0 ± 0.1 cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 3F). β-Catenin Enhances Expression of VEGF in Cardiomyocytes and Cardiac Fibroblasts and Induces Contractile Protein in Cardiac Fibroblasts—Because angiogenesis is an important feature in the healing process after MI, and because cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts are potential sources of VEGF, we also examined the effects of β-catenin on VEGF expression in both cell types. Transfection of Ad-catenin resulted in increased VEGF expression compared with Ad-GFP, which was reversed by NCadΔC (Fig. 4A). Proliferation of endothelial cells significantly increased after adding the culture supernatants from cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts (absorption, 155 ± 7% versus 100 ± 8% in cardiomyocytes and 124 ± 6% versus 100 ± 5% in cardiac fibroblasts for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 4B). In addition, β-catenin gene transfer resulted in a significant increase in the fraction of α-SMA-expressing fibroblasts compared with Ad-GFP (52 ± 8% versus 11 ± 2% for Ad-catenin versus Ad-GFP, p < 0.05; Fig. 4C), and Western blotting showed that the expression of α-SMA increased in Ad-catenin-transfected cells than in Ad-GFP-transfected cells (Fig. 4D), suggesting that β-catenin overexpression may induce differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. β-Catenin Reduces MI Size and Preserves LV Function—From these data, we hypothesized that β-catenin overexpression could be beneficial in myocardial regeneration after injury. Therefore, we performed gene transfer of either Ad-catenin or Ad-GFP in vivo, after inducing a MI in rats. At base line and day 3 after MI, there was no significant difference in the FS, LVESD, LVEDD, and end diastolic ATW between Adcatenin-injected rats and Ad-GFP-injected rats as measured by echocardiography. At day 7, the LVEDD was significantly smaller (6.6 ± 0.5 mm versus 7.8 ± 0.5 mm, p < 0.05), and fractional shortening was significantly higher in Ad-catenininjected rats compared with Ad-GFP-injected rats (31 ± 4% versus 25 ± 4%, p < 0.05; Fig. 5). Ad-catenin-injected rats also showed thicker end diastolic ATW (MI scar area) than control rats (1.03 ± 0.11 mm versus 0.82 ± 0.08 mm, p < 0.05) with no significant difference in posterior wall thickness (Fig. 5, A-D). Similar results were observed at day 14. On histological analysis, the infarcted area ratio was significantly lower in Ad-catenin-injected rats compared with control gene-injected rats at day 7 after MI (25 ± 7% versus 32 ± 7%, p < 0.05; Fig. 5, E and F). To confirm successful transfection, we performed immunofluorescent staining of hemagglutinin (indicating exogenous β-catenin), which showed that Ad-catenin was transfected successfully in vivo. Moreover, we observed strong intranuclear exogenous β-catenin expression in some cells, suggesting overexpressed β-catenin was translocated to the nucleus and resulted in transcriptional activation. Simultaneous staining of troponin T for cardiomyocytes revealed intranuclear exogenous β-catenin expression not only in cardiomyocytes but also in myofibroblasts in the interstitium (Fig. 5G). β-Catenin Decreases Apoptosis and Increases Capillary Density with Enhanced Cell Cycle Activity in Peri-infarct Area of Rat MI Model—At day 7, apoptosis decreased significantly in Ad-catenin-injected rats compared with Ad-GFP-injected rats (TUNEL-positive cells, 23 ±"
https://openalex.org/W2098503066,"Actin filament growth and disassembly, as well as affinity for actin-binding proteins, is mediated by the nucleotide-bound state of the component actin monomers. The structural differences between ATP-actin and ADP-actin, however, remain controversial. We expressed a cytoplasmic actin in Sf9 cells, which was rendered non-polymerizable by virtue of two point mutations in subdomain 4 (A204E/P243K). This homogeneous monomer, called AP-actin, was crystallized in the absence of toxins, binding proteins, or chemical modification, with ATP or ADP at the active site. The two surface mutations do not perturb the structure. Significant differences between the two states are confined to the active site region and sensor loop. The active site cleft remains closed in both states. Minor structural shifts propagate from the active site toward subdomain 2, but dissipate before reaching the DNase binding loop (D-loop), which remains disordered in both the ADP and ATP states. This result contrasts with previous structures of actin made monomeric by modification with tetramethylrhodamine, which show formation of an α-helix at the distal end of the D-loop in the ADP-bound but not the ATP-bound form (Otterbein, L. R., Graceffa, P., and Dominguez, R. (2001) Science 293, 708-711). Our reanalysis of the TMR-modified actin structures suggests that the nucleotide-dependent formation of the D-loop helix may result from signal propagation through crystal packing interactions. Whereas the observed nucleotide-dependent changes in the structure present significantly different surfaces on the exterior of the actin monomer, current models of the actin filament lack any actin-actin interactions that involve the region of these key structural changes."

https://openalex.org/W2049165636,"Photosystem II (PSII) core complexes consist of CP47, CP43, D1, D2 proteins and of several low molecular weight integral membrane polypeptides, such as the chloroplast-encoded PsbE, PsbF, and PsbI proteins. To elucidate the function of PsbI in the photosynthetic process as well as in the biogenesis of PSII in higher plants, we generated homoplastomic knock-out plants by replacing most of the tobacco psbI gene with a spectinomycin resistance cartridge. Mutant plants are photoautotrophically viable under green house conditions but sensitive to high light irradiation. Antenna proteins of PSII accumulate to normal amounts, but levels of the PSII core complex are reduced by 50%. Bioenergetic and fluorescence studies uncovered that PsbI is required for the stability but not for the assembly of dimeric PSII and supercomplexes consisting of PSII and the outer antenna (PSII-LHCII). Thermoluminescence emission bands indicate that the presence of PsbI is required for assembly of a fully functional QA binding site. We show that phosphorylation of the reaction center proteins D1 and D2 is light and redox-regulated in the wild type, but phosphorylation is abolished in the mutant, presumably due to structural alterations of PSII when PsbI is deficient. Unlike wild type, phosphorylation of LHCII is strongly increased in the dark due to accumulation of reduced plastoquinone, whereas even upon state II light phosphorylation is decreased in ΔpsbI. These data attest that phosphorylation of D1/D2, CP43, and LHCII is regulated differently.

In photosynthetic eukaryotes, the majority, namely PsbE, F, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, Tc, and Z, are plastome-encoded; the remaining five, PsbR, Tn, W, X, and Y1/Y2, are encoded by nuclear genes (4Thornton L.E.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands2005: 121-138Google Scholar). The high homology between the plastome-encoded and cyanobacterial LMWs suggests conserved roles, as has been proposed for PsbE and PsbF, the α and β subunits of the two-chain cytochrome b559. Cytochrome b559 is a mandatory constituent of PSII that plays a major role in PSII function and biogenesis (5Pakrasi H.B. Williams J.G. Arntzen C.J.

Genomics. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The LMW components of PSII are generally bitopic, i.e. harbor a single transmembrane helix, and in all members, except for PsbK and PsbTc, the N-terminal domain has been suggested to be exposed to the stromal face of the membrane complex (PsbE, PsbF, PsbH, PsbI, PsbJ, PsbL, and PsbM) (for review, see Ref. 2Shi L.-X. Schröder W.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 75-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PsbH is the only known LMW component, which is phosphorylated in the chloroplast, but its phosphorylation is missing in cyanobacteria (8Bennett J. Nature. 1977; 269: 344-346Crossref Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Apart from PsbH, the other major thylakoid phosphoproteins are those of the light-harvesting protein complex (LHCII) and of the PSII core (CP43 and the reaction center proteins D1 and D2) (9Bellafiore S.

Biochemical approaches and x-ray crystallography have been instrumental in determining the localization of the LMW proteins within the PSII assembly. For the thermophile cyanobacterial PSII core complex, the location of these proteins has been specified with increasing precision (12Vasil'ev S. Orth P. Zouni A. Owens T.G. Bruce D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

These components are either located at the periphery of the PSII core monomers or centrally, at the interface of the two PSII monomers forming a dimer (17Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar). However, besides the psbEFLJ operon products (19Regel R.E. Ivleva N.B. Zer H. Meurer J. Shestakov S.V.

Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), relatively little is known about the function of the other LMWs, their interactions with PSII core components, or their relevance for lipid-protein interactions for the assembly and the energy transfer processes. The majority of LMWs of PSII in cyanobacteria define the boundary between the dimeric complex and the surrounding lipids of the thylakoid membrane, whereas in the chloroplast many of these proteins form the border between the core complex and the minor light-harvesting antenna system, CP29, CP26, and CP24, and presumably also the trimeric LHCII, constituting the mobile antenna of the complex (3Dekker J.P. Boekema E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1706: 12-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). Consequently, the LMWs in the chloroplast may be involved in processes different from those of their cyanobacterial counterparts and, for instance, affect regulation of state transition or antenna-related processes like light-trapping or non-photochemical quenching (20Bassi R. Sandona D. Croce R. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 769-779Crossref Google Scholar, 21Niyogi K.K. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 50: 333-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). Because of an evolutionary functional divergence, inactivation of homologous LMWs in cyanobacteria and green algae/higher plants can lead to quite different phenotypes, as has recently been shown for PsbJ and PsbL (22Ohad I. Dal Bosco C. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Although the loss of these proteins has only a minor effect in Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, relatively dramatic changes of PSII function and stability have been noted in the corresponding tobacco mutants. Inactivation of PsbJ and PsbL in plants affects the QA re-oxidation kinetics and the back-electron flow from plastoquinol to QA, respectively (19Regel R.E. Ivleva N.B. Zer H. Meurer J. Shestakov S.V.

Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Similarly, inactivation of PsbH, PsbI, and PsbK in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of algae resulted in quite diverse phenotypes (for details and review, see Refs.1Minagawa J. Takahashi Y. Photosynth. Res. 2004; 82: 241-263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Shi L.-X. Schröder W.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1608: 75-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, conceivable to conduct comparative studies on different evolutionary lineages in a phylogenetic context. Moreover, the biogenesis of PSII components differs in cyanobacteria and higher plants. Because of the dual genetic origin of the thylakoid system in higher plants, the biogenesis depends largely on factors encoded by the nuclear genome. For instance, HCF136, one of these factors, is essential for the biogenesis of the PSII core complex in higher plants, but its homologous protein appears to be largely dispensable in cyanobacteria (23Meurer J. Plücken H. Kowallik K.V. Westhoff P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5286-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 24Shen G. Zhao J. Reimer S.K. Antonkine M.L. Cai Q. Weiland S.M. Golbeck J.H. Bryant D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20343-20354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The assignment of several LMW subunits including PsbI (4.8 kDa) to the x-ray structure of PSII still remains to be settled (25Kern J. Loll B. Zouni A. Saenger W. Irrgang K.D. Biesiadka J. Photosynth. Res. 2005; 84: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 26Zheleva D. Sharma J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Barber J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16122-16127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Earlier studies of the cyanobacterial PSII x-ray structure placed the transmembrane helix of PsbI opposite to the dimerization axis and close to Chlz D2 (13Zouni A. Witt H.T. Kern J. Fromme P. Krauss N. Saenger W. Orth P. Nature. 2001; 409: 739-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1747) Google Scholar), whereas the crystallographic studies located the PsbI protein at the periphery of PSII core, in close proximity to Chlz D1, the helices A and B of the D1 protein, and the helix VI of CP43 (17Ferreira K.N. Iverson T.M. Maghlaoui K. Barber J. Iwata S. Science. 2004; 303: 1831-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (2796) Google Scholar, 18Loll B. Kern J. Saenger W. Zouni A. Biesiadka J. Nature. 2005; 15: 1040-1044Crossref Scopus (1583) Google Scholar). PsbI was present in PSII reaction center (RC) preparations of both spinach and cyanobacteria (27Ikeuchi M. Koike H. Inoue Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 251: 155-160Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). No knock-out strains for psbI are currently available from higher plants. Mutants lacking PsbI have been generated from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (28Künstner P. Guardiola A. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9651-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and Synechocystis (29Ikeuchi M. Shukla V.K. Pakarasi H.B. Inoue Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Inactivation of psbI in Synechocystis and Thermosynechococcus elongatus strain BP-1 caused some reduction of PSII activity, resulting in decreased oxygen evolution to 70-80% of WT levels, but the mutants grew photoautotrophically. The Synechocystis ΔpsbI mutant was found to be slightly more sensitive to light than the corresponding WT (29Ikeuchi M. Shukla V.K. Pakarasi H.B. Inoue Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 249: 622-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Deletion of psbI in C. reinhardtii caused a more severe effect compared with that in cyanobacteria (28Künstner P. Guardiola A. Takahashi Y. Rochaix J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9651-9654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although the C. reinhardtii ΔpsbI mutant grows photoautotrophically under low light, its growth rate was quite sensitive to high light. Both the amounts of PSII and the oxygen evolution activity in the mutant were found to be only 10-20% of WT levels. In an attempt to evaluate the roles as well as biogenetic and phylogenetic aspects of the enigmatic LMW PSII subunits, we have systematically inactivated individual genes using a transplastomic approach in tobacco. Here we demonstrate that PsbI exerts a crucial role in the stability of dimeric PSII and the intrinsic electron flow as well as in the phosphorylation of proteins of the core complex and the light-harvesting antenna of PSII in tobacco. Knock-out Construct Strategy for ΔpsbI—In the tobacco plastome the psbI gene is located downstream of psbK, which also encodes a LMW PSII polypeptide (30Webber A.N. Packman L. Chapman D.J. Barber J.

In a transplastomic approach, the psbI gene of Nicotiana tabacum cv. Petit Havanna, 110 bp in length (nucleotide position 8398-8508 on the plastid chromosome; GenBank™/EBI accession number Z00044), was inactivated by replacing most of the gene with the terminator-less, chimeric amino glycoside 3′ adenyl transferase (aadA) cassette conferring resistance to spectinomycin in reading frame orientation (7Swiatek M. Regel R.E. Meurer J. Wanner G. Pakarasi H.B. Ohad I. Herrmann R.G. Mol. Genet. Genomics. 2003; 268: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For this, two PCR reactions were performed with primers psbI-1 (5′-GGA TCC AAA ATG CAA TTA TCT CTC C-3′) and psbI-2 (5′-AAG CTT GCA GCT GAA TTC TAC ACA ATC TCC AAG ATG-3′) and with primers psbI-3 (5′-GAA TTC AGC TGC AAG CTT ATC CCG GAC GTA ATC CTG G-3′) and psbI-4 (5′-ATC TCG AGA TTA CAA CTA TAA CAG GC-3′). PsbI-2 and psbI-3 generated overlapping products and introduced a diagnostic EcoRI restriction site. The third reaction was performed with primers psbI-1 and psbI-4 using the first PCR product as a template. Primers psbI-1 and psbI-4 introduced two flanking restriction sites, BamHI and XhoI, used for cloning into the vector pBluescript II KS-(Stratagene Inc., La Jolla, CA). The presence of a unique restriction site, BtrI, within the disrupted psbI gene allowed the insertion of the aadA cassette between the EcoRI and BtrI restriction sites. The details of the map construction, location of restriction sites, and primer annealing positions are shown in Fig. 1 A and B. The resulting construct (carrying the aadA cassette in the same polarity as psbI) was sequenced to verify correct copying of the gene and used for plastid transformation employed in a biolistic approach (33Svab Z. Hajdukiewicz P. Maliga P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8526-8530Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Selection and culture conditions of the transformed material as well as the check for homoplastomy were carried out as described (7Swiatek M. Regel R.E. Meurer J. Wanner G. Pakarasi H.B. Ohad I.

The transformed material was first grown (12-h photoperiod at 25 °C, 10-20 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity) for 4-5 weeks on Murashige and Skoog (34Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol.

Before transferring the plants to the greenhouse, they were kept for 4-5 weeks on Murashige and Skoog medium without sucrose. If not otherwise indicated, all analyses were carried out with young leaves of ∼2-month-old plants grown in vitro and under greenhouse conditions (day 27 °C, night 20 °C), respectively. Tobacco lines carrying the aadA cassette in a neutral insertion site and referred to as RV plants were used as WT control plants (22Ohad I. Dal Bosco C. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J.

Proteins separated by SDS-Tris-glycine-PAGE (15% acrylamide) (35Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) were electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Biosciences), incubated with monospecific polyclonal antisera (7Swiatek M.

Thylakoid membranes equivalent to 30 μg of chlorophyll were solubilized with dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (1% final concentration) and separated on a 4-12% acrylamide gradient. After electrophoresis, lanes of the BN polyacrylamide gel were excised, denatured, and run in the second dimension in SDS-PAGE with 15% acrylamide and 4 m urea. Subsequently, the gels were silver-stained or used for immunoblotting. Individual spots were labeled according to their determination by mass spectrometry (38Granvogl B. Reisinger V. Eichacker L.A. Proteomics. 2006; 6: 3681-3695Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In Vitro Phosphorylation of PSII Proteins—Redox-dependent LHCII phosphorylation of WT and mutant thylakoids was carried out as described (39Zer H. Vink M. Scochat S. Herrmann R.G. Andersson B. Ohad I. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Activation of the protein kinase in the dark was obtained by the addition of reduced duroquinol (1 mm) (40Allen J. Horton P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 638: 290-295Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was terminated by the addition of denaturing sample buffer, and the sample proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The extent of phosphorylation was detected with phosphothreonine antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc., Berlin, Germany; New England Biolabs, County Road, MA). Chlorophyll a Fluorescence Induction Kinetics—Chlorophyll a fluorescence induction kinetics of tobacco WT and mutant leaves was measured using a pulse-modulated fluorimeter (PAM101, Waltz, Effeltrich, Germany) (22Ohad I. Dal Bosco C. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Leaves were dark-adapted for 5 min before the fluorescence measurements. The minimal (Fo) and maximal (Fm) fluorescence yield and the variable fluorescence (Fv), calculated as (Fm - Fo) as well as the ratio Fv/Fm, which reflects the potential yield of the photochemical reaction of PSII (41Krause G.H. Weis E. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1991; 42: 313-349Crossref Scopus (3601) Google Scholar), were recorded at room temperature. Photochemical and non-photochemical quenching (qP and NPQ, respectively) were calculated as (Fm - Fm′)/Fm′) and (Fm′-F)/(Fm′-Fo), respectively (42van Kooten O. Snel J.F.H. Photosynth. Res. 1990; 25: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (2022) Google Scholar). Measurements of PSI Activity—Photosystem I activity was measured on leaves as absorption changes at 830 nm induced by far red light (ΔAmax) (730 nm; 12 watts m-2) and in the absence or presence of actinic light (ΔA) (650 nm, 20 and 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) using the PSI attachment of PAM101 (Walz, Effeltrich, Germany) (43Klughammer C. Schreiber U. Planta. 1994; 192: 261-268Crossref Google Scholar). The oxidation status of PSI at the light intensities indicated was expressed as the fraction ΔA/ΔAmax. Thermoluminescence (TL) Measurements—TL measurements were performed using a home built apparatus (22Ohad I. Dal Bosco C. Herrmann R.G. Meurer J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 2297-2308Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Thylakoid fractions were prepared by grinding leaves in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 20mm NaCl, and 100 mm sorbitol. Homogenized material was filtered through nylon micromesh and used immediately for measurements. Samples (200 μl; 10-15 μg chlorophyll/sample) were dark-adapted on the TL stage at 20 °C for 3 min and then rapidly frozen to -20 °C. The samples were then excited with saturating flashes delivered by a xenon arc discharge lamp (EG&G, 0.05-microfarad capacitor, charged at 1000 V, 3 μs at 70% light emission). TL was recorded upon heating the sample at a constant rate of 0.6 °C s-1. The herbicides DCMU (3-[3′,4′-dichlorphenyl]-1,1-dimethylurea) or Ioxynil (4-hydroxy-3,5-di-iodobenzonitrile) were added at concentrations of 10 and 5 μm, respectively, to inhibit the electron transfer from QA-to QB. For measuring the B band (QB-/S2,S3 recombination) oscillations, the dark-adapted samples were slowly cooled, and consecutive flashes (1-6 flashes, time interval 300 ms) were applied between 1 and 0 °C followed by rapid cooling to -10 °C. Low Temperature Fluorescence Measurements—Low temperature (77 K) emission spectra were performed with thylakoids prepared from young dark-adapted leaves of WT and ΔpsbI plants (44Weis E. Photosynth. Res. 1985; 6: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thylakoid membranes (40 μg chlorophyll/ml) were transferred into a glass tube (0.7-mm internal diameter) for fluorescence measurements and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fluorescence was excited at 440 nm, and the emission was recorded between 650 and 800 nm. All spectra were recorded with a Jobin Yvon Spex Fluorolog spectrofluorometer (Horiba, France) equipped with a photomultiplier (R 374, Hamamatsu, Japan). Slits of 1 nm were used. Photoinhibition—To determine the sensitivity of PSII to oxidative stress, leaves of WT and ΔpsbI plants grown under greenhouse conditions were exposed to 500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, and the photoinactivation of PSII was measured as Δ(Fv/Fm)/time. To estimate the PSII recovery process during the exposure to the high light treatment, leaf discs were exposed to a similar light treatment after preinfiltration with a solution of d-threo-chloramphenicol (200 μgml-1) for 30 min before the light exposure. For control purposes leaf discs were incubated in water. To assess the photoinhibition and the capacity to recover from photoinhibition, leaves were also exposed to 1500 μmol of photons m-2 s-1 until a similar loss of activity was reached in both WT and ΔpsbI (measured as Fv/Fm = 0.17), and subsequently incubated at low light (3 μmol photons m-2 s-1) for up to 6 h, measuring the Fv/Fm level every 1 h. Disruption of psbI in the tobacco plastid chromosome caused an increased light sensitivity, but young leaves appeared normal green in independent transformants. Comparable with ΔpsbZ but different from ΔpsbE, -F, -L, or-J (19Regel R.E. Ivleva N.B. Zer H. Meurer J. Shestakov S.V. Herrmann R.G. Pakarasi H.B. Ohad I. J. Biol.

Initial fluorescence kinetic data of ΔpsbI suggested a defect in PSII (see below). ΔpsbI Mutants Exhibit a Low Photosystem II Quantum Yield—Measurements of PSII quantum yield of ΔpsbI plants grown autotrophically exhibited an increased minimal fluorescence, Fo, causing a reduced ratio Fv/Fm between 0.25 and 0.74 depending on the leaf age as compared with a stable ratio of 0.81 ± 0.02 in the WT. The lower value was found exclusively in older leaves, indicating a gradual loss of quantum efficiency with aging of the leaf. The average Fv/Fm value in rapidly expanding young leaves detached from the upper part of the plants was in the range of 0.66-0.74. Fluorimetric measurements indicated a higher NPQ (0.24 ± 0.06 versus 0.17 ± 0.03 in WT) elicited at low actinic light intensity (20 μmol of photons m-2 s-1) and a lower NPQ (0.77 ± 0.25 versus 1.21 ± 0.21 in WT) when the actinic light intensity was raised to 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1. The photochemical quenching (qP) part in ΔpsbI remained almost unchanged at both light regimes (0.99 ± 0.02 versus 0.94 ± 0.01 in WT and 0.78 ± 0.09 versus 0.76 ± 0.12 in WT at 20 and 250 μmol of photons m-2 s-1, respectively) (Table 1).TABLE 1Spectroscopic and fluorimetric data of WT and ΔpsbI mutantNon-photochemical quenchingaQuenching of excitation states of PSII reaction centers mostly by heat dissipation.Photochemical quenchingbQuenching of excitation states of PSII reaction centers by photochemistry.Redox state of PSI (ΔA/ΔAmaxcΔA/ΔAmax, P700 oxidation ratio.)FPSI/FPSIIdFPSI/FPSII, ratio of 77K fluorescence emitted by PSI and PSII.20 μE/m2s1250 μE/m2s120 μE/m2s1250 μE/m2s120 μE/m2s1250 μE/m2s1Dark50 μE/m2s1 (650 nm)WT0.17 ± 0.031.21 ± 0.210.94 ± 0.010.76 ± 0.121282.28 ± 0.132.53 ± 0.09ΔpsbI0.24 ± 0.060.77 ± 0.250.99 ± 0.020.78 ± 0.097664.23 ± 0.203.77 ± 0.17a Quenching of excitation states of PSII reaction centers mostly by heat dissipation.b Quenching of excitation states of PSII reaction centers by photochemistry.c ΔA/ΔAmax, P700 oxidation ratio.d FPSI/FPSII, ratio of 77K fluorescence emitted by PSI and PSII.

Trans. 2004; 32: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).Unlike the situation for downstream effectors sensitive to Ca2+ mobilization, elucidation of the downstream effector(s) for Wnt-regulated changes in the intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP has remained elusive. It is not known, for example, whether the signals from Wnt5a mediated via Frizzled-2 to Ca2+ mobilization and to cyclic GMP PDE operate in concert or act independently of each other in the Wnt/Ca2+/cGMP pathway. Although probed in zebrafish embryos and mouse F9 cells, Ca2+ mobilization in response to Wnt signaling has not been investigated in the context of immediate upstream regulatory element. In the current study, we identify the cyclic GMP-dependent, serine/threonine protein kinase G (PKG) as a primary upstream effector of Ca2+ mobilization in response to Wnt5a, essential for signaling of the noncanonical Wnt/cGMP/Ca2+ pathway.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture—Mouse F9 teratocarcinoma cells were obtained from the ATCC collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were propagated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, South Logan, UT) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Clones stably transfected with pcDNA3 harboring either Rfz2 or β2AR/Rfz2 or co-transfected with NF-AT-sensitive luciferase reporter gene (NFAT-Luc) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) were selected in medium containing neomycin analogue, G418 (0.4 mg/ml; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). At least three independent clones were propagated for each transfection and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mg/ml G418. The H7 clone of human embryonic stem cells (hESC) was obtained from the WiCell Research Institute. H7 cells were cultured on mytomycin C-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20% knock-out serum replacement, 1% nonessential amino acids, 1 mml-glutamine, 0.1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 4 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (all from Invitrogen). Purified mouse recombinant Wnt5a (645-WN) and anti-Wnt5a antibody (AF645) were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).Assay of PKG Activity—PKG activity was determined as described previously with modifications (15Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, supernatants (20 μl) from the crude whole cell fractions were employed with 200 mg/ml PKG-specific heptapeptide substrate (RKRSRAE; Bachem, San Siego, CA), 50 μm ATP, and 2.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in TMG buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm glycerophosphate, 100 nm okadaic acid, and a protease inhibitor mixture (10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 4 μl of 2 n HCl. Preboiled or HCl-treated supernatants were used as blank samples. Twenty microliters of the resultant mixture were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose filters. Air-dried P-81 filters were washed with H3PO4 (75 mm) three times. Incorporated γ-32P in substrates were measured by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The samples were assayed in triplicate. Kinase activity is normalized with protein concentration and presented in percentages of PKG activity of treatment group to that of the control group.Cytoplasmic Calcium Measurement—Mouse F9 cells were plated on collagen-coated coverslips inserted in 35-mm dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA) and cultured overnight. hESC free of contaminating mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured on Matrigel-coated (BD Biosciences) coverslips in medium conditioned by mouse embryonic fibroblasts and supplemented with basic fibroblast growth factor. The intracellular Ca2+ was measured as described (16Wang H. Goligorsky M.S. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1817-1821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, coverslip-at-tached cells were loaded with 2 μm Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 40 min at 37 °C in the dark. The cells were then washed three times with Krebs buffer composed of 128 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 77.5 mm NaH2PO4, 1.3 mm MgSO4, and 1.3 mm CaCl2 and kept in the same buffer at room temperature for 10 min in the dark. Fura-2-loaded cells were treated with isoproterenol (10 μm) or with Wnt5a (25 ng/ml) or buffer alone. The cells were immediately monitored via a Hamamatsu OREA ER-AG digital CCD camera coupled to a Nikon inverted microscope. Excitation at 340 and 380 nm were generated using a 175-watt ozone-free xenon lamp and a Fura-2 fluorescence filter set coupled to a Sutter Lambda DG-4 high speed filter switcher. The emitted light was channeled into the CCD camera via an ultraviolet dichroic mirror and an interference filter of 510 mm. Measurement of fluorescence intensity was performed at a rate of 200 points/s, and the ratio of absorbance at 340/381 nm (A340/A380) was computed using Dynamic Intensity Analysis (Compix Inc., Cranberry Township, PA).Treatment of Cells with Morpholino Antisense Oligonucleotides—Morpholino phosphorodiamidate antisense oligonucleotides targeting the translational initiation sites of Gαt2, Gαt1, and Gαo were purchased from Gene Tools (Corvallis, OR). The sequences of morpholinos for Gαt2, Gαt1, and Gαo are as follows: CACTCCCCATTTCTGCTGTCTCCTC is for Gαt2, CTCCCCGGCCTCCTCAGACGACCTT is for Gαt1, and CCTCTGCGCTCAGCGTACATCCCAT is for Gαo.F9 cells (wild-type or stably transfected with the desired genes according to the requirements of the experiments) were treated with morpholino antisense oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer's Special Delivery protocol. Briefly, the cells were seeded onto 60-mm culture dishes. The cells were 80% confluence on the day morpholino treatment was applied. Growth medium was replaced by the serum-free medium containing 1.4 μm morpholino antisense oligonucleotides and 0.6 μm ethoxylated polyethylenimine delivery reagent. After 3 h of incubation at 37 °C, the cells were grown in standard culture medium with serum, but free of morpholinos, for an additional 72 h before the expression levels of target proteins were assessed by immunoblotting. For cultures that were subsequently subjected to further PKG or NF-AT activity assays, the cells were treated either with isoproterenol or Wnt5a or not (control).Immunoblotting—Whole cell lysates were used for detecting PKG and G protein subunits. The samples (30 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE for separation. The resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The blots were probed with antibodies against PKGIβ, PKGIα/β (Stressgen Biotechnologies, Victoria, Canada), or the indicated G protein subunits (anti-Gαt1 and anti-Gαt2 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA; anti-Gαo from Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and followed by incubation with a corresponding peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; anti-rabbit from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence method, as per the manufacturer's instructions. Equal loading was verified by probing with antibodies to β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich).NF-AT-sensitive Luciferase Assay—F9 clones stably co-transfected with NF-AT reporter gene and with expression vector harboring either Rfz2 or β2AR/Rfz1 chimera were cultured on 12-well plates. The cells were starved from serum for overnight and then were stimulated with Wnt5a (25 ng/ml) or isoprotenerol (10 μm) for 5 h or indicated periods. The cells were lysed with 1× luciferase cell culture lysis reagent (Promega, Madison, WI). Supernatants from cell lysates were subjected to luciferase assay according to the manufacturer's instruction (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Briefly, 20 μl of supernatant were mixed with 100 μl of luciferase assay buffer (40 mm Tricine, pH 7.8, 0.5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm 1,4-dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm coenzyme A, and 0.5 mm luciferin), and the intensity of luminenscence was immediately measured using a luminometer (Lumat LB 9507; Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN). Samples were assayed in triplicate, and the luciferase activity was normalized based on protein concentrations of the cell lysate. The results are presented as ratios of relative light units of treatment groups to control groups.Statistical Analysis—The experiments were conducted at least in triplicate. All of the data are expressed as the means ± S.E. from at least three separate experiments. Comparisons of data among groups were performed with one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls test. Statistical significance (p value of less than 0.05) is denoted with asterisks or pound symbols.RESULTSCa2+ Mobilization in Response to Frizzled-2 Activation in Mouse Embryonic F9 Cells—The mouse F9 embryonic teratocarcinoma (F9) cells are totipotent cells that were shown earlier to be capable of being transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor/Frizzled chimeras or authentic Frizzleds that, when activated, promote these embryonic cells in culture to form a primitive endoderm-like phenotype characteristic of early stages in mouse development (2Liu T.

Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). These cells express a modest number of β2-adrenergic receptors. Frizzled-2 expression by wildtype F9 cells, if any, is insufficient to enable Wnt5a-stimulated activation of the cyclic GMP/Ca2+ pathway.Mouse F9 cells stably expressing the β2-adrenergic/rat Frizzled-2 chimera (β2AR/Rfz2), a chimera that binds β-adrenergic agonist but stimulates the Frizzled-2 pathway (17Liu X. Liu T. Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Wang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In these embryonic cells, activation of the Frizzled-2 chimera provokes an increase in intracellular concentrations of Ca2+ within 60 s that can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy and monitored in real time as the change in the ratio of absorbance of light at 340 nm versus that at 380 nm, that is characteristic for Ca2+-activated Fura-2. The kinetics of the Ca2+ response agrees well with earlier measurements assayed by spectroscopy (17Liu X. Liu T. Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Malbon C.C. Moon R.T. Wang H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14383-14388Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The Frizzled-2 stimulation of Ca2+ mobilization plateaus within 3 min and is maintained for up to 10 min in the continued presence of agonist stimulation. Stimulating zebrafish embryos expressing β2AR/Rfz2 chimera with isoproterenol leads to Ca2+ transients (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), identical in character to those stimulated by Wnt5a alone (12Slusarski D.C. Yang-Snyder J. Busa W.B. Moon R.T. Dev. Biol. 1997; 182: 114-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Wildtype (WT) and F9 cells stably transfected with an “empty” expression vector display no Ca2+ response to activation of the Frizzled-2 pathway (Fig. 1A, inset).The pharmacological properties of the Ca2+ response of F9 cells expressing the Frizzled-2 chimera to β-adrenergic agonist was probed further. The increase in intracellular Ca2+ stimulated by activation of the Frizzled-2 chimera with agonist could be abolished by simultaneous treatment with the β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol (+Pro, 10 μm) (Fig. 1B). Expression of this Frizzled-2 chimera in zebrafish embryos by-passed the need for purified Wnt5a, allowing the use of isoproterenol to activate the noncanonical pathway, a response that also was sensitive to antagonism by propranolol (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The Frizzled-2 activation of Ca2+ mobilization was sharply attenuated by the pretreatment of the F9 cells with pertussis toxin (Fig. 1B), an agent that catalyzes the ADP-ribosylation and inactivation of G protein α-subunits of the Gαi family, including Gαi1,2,3, Gαo, and Gαt (18Manning D.R.

Wnt5a stimulates a mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in the F9 clones expressing Frizzled-2 (Fig. 1C). Application of Wnt3a, which can activate Frizzled-1 but not Frizzled-2 receptors, in contrast, did not stimulate the Ca2+ response (data not shown). Differences in the kinetics of the stimulated Ca2+ mobilization between the clones expressing Frizzled-2 versus the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera are apparent (Fig. 1, B and C). First, the kinetics of the Ca2+ response to Wnt5a stimulation was biphasic, whereas the response to stimulation of the chimeric receptor was not. Second, the kinetics of Ca2+ response to Wnt5a stimulation was not as rapid as that of F9 cells expressing the chimera and stimulated by β-adrenergic agonist. The slower and atypical kinetics of the Wnt5a-stimulated response are likely to be a reflection of the palmitoylated, glycoprotein nature of the Wnt5a, which tends to form micelles in slow equilibrium with the bulk solution and Frizzled receptors (21Willert K. Brown J.D. Danenberg E. Duncan A.W. Weissman I.L. Reya T. Yates J.R. Nusse R. Nature. 2003; 423: 448-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). Pertussis toxin treatment nearly abolished Wnt5a-stimulated Ca2+ mobilization for F9 cells expressing the Frizzled-2, as it did for clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera stimulated by isoproterenol (Fig. 1, B and C). These experiments are the first to demonstrate a bona fide, pertussis toxinsensitive Ca2+ mobilization of mammalian embryonic cells in culture, following activation of the Frizzled-2 pathway. With this model system, detailed biochemical analysis of the downstream signaling of the Wnt/Ca2+/cGMP that is not possible in zebrafish embryos was enabled in F9 cells. Finally, we tested in another embryonic cell line, H7 hESC in culture, whether purified Wnt5a regulated the intracellular Ca2+ concentration, using the same approach adopted for F9 cells. Although not fully characterized, hESC do express Frizzled-2 receptor (data not shown). Treating H7 hESC with Wnt5a stimulated an increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels (Fig. 1D), which agrees with the response observed in F9 cells (Fig. 1C). The addition of excess anti-Wnt5a antibody to the Wnt5a mixture neutralized the ligand, blocking the Wnt5a-stimulated Ca2+ response (Fig. 1D).Frizzled-2 Regulates NF-AT-dependent Transcriptional Activation—Whereas the canonical Wnt/β-catenin pathway signals to the level of Lef/Tcf-sensitive transcriptional activation (5Cadigan K.M. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3286-3305Crossref PubMed Scopus (2210) Google Scholar), the noncanonical Wnt/Ca2+ pathway has been reported in Xenopus embryos to activate a group of developmentally important genes, including those dependent upon the nuclear transcription factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) (11Saneyoshi T. Kume S. Amasaki Y. Mikoshiba K. Nature. 2002; 417: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Using a luciferase-based reporter gene construct to assay NF-AT-dependent gene transcription, we set out to test whether the Frizzled-2 signaling downstream of Ca2+ mobilization and cyclic GMP extended in mammalian cells to the level of NF-AT-sensitive transcription. NF-AT-dependent transcription indeed was activated in F9 clones expressing the Frizzled-2 chimera treated with β-adrenergic agonist (Fig. 2A). The transcriptional response to Frizzled-2 activation was first observed at 2 h poststimulation, with a peak response noted within 5 h. The NF-AT transcriptional response remained elevated for more than 5 h, thereafter declining to near basal levels within 20 h. For F9 cells expressing the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera, treatment with β-adrenergic antagonist propranolol effectively blocks the Frizzled-2-mediated activation of the NF-AT-dependent transcription in response to isoproterenol, as it does the Ca2+ mobilization (Fig. 1B).FIGURE 2Frizzled-2 signaling to NF-AT-dependent transcription. A, mouse F9 cells were stably co-transfected with β2AR/Rfz2 and NF-AT luciferase reporter gene (NF-AT-Luc).

Stable clones were treated with Wnt5a for periods indicated, and the activity of NF-AT-dependent luciferase reporter was measured. C, mouse F9 clones stably expressing rat Frizzled-2 were transfected with NF-AT-Luc. The cells were treated with (+Wnt5a, 25 ng/ml) or without Wnt5a (-Wnt5a) for 6 h.

D, mouse F9 cells were transfected with NF-AT-Luc alone or co-transfected with expression vectors harboring either the β2AR/Rfz1 or β2AR/Rfz2 chimera. The expressions of β2AR/Rfz1 or β2AR/Rfz2 chimeric receptors analyzed by radioligand binding assay were comparable (β2AR/Rfz1, 12.3 pmol/mg membrane protein; β2AR/Rfz2, 11.7 pmol/mg membrane protein) (30DeCostanzo A.J.

The cells were then stimulated by isoproterenol (Iso, 10 μm) for 5 h, and the luciferase activity assay was performed using a whole cell lysate to determine NF-AT-dependent transcriptional activity (upper panel).

Wnt5a stimulates a transcriptional response in the Rfz2-expressing clones, but not in those clones expressing the empty expression vector. The NF-AT-dependent transcriptional response to Wnt5a stimulation displays kinetics (Fig. 2B) in good agreement with those obtained in F9 cells expressing the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera (Fig. 2A).The NF-AT-dependent transcriptional response was tested for specificity. Wnt5a antibody, which neutralizes the ligand, abolishes Wnt5a-stimulated activation of NF-AT-dependent transcription in rat Frizzled-2-expressing cells (Fig. 2C). F9 clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera were compared with the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera-expressing clones for NF-AT transcriptional activation in response to stimulation with β-agonist (Fig. 2D). Treatment with the β-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol stimulates activation of the NF-AT-dependent transcription in clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz2 chimera. The F9 clones expressing the β2AR/Rfz1 chimera, in sharp contrast, displayed little NF-AT-sensitive transcriptional activation, i.e. the same level of NF-AT-dependent transcription observed in the WT or empty vector transfected F9 cells (data not shown). These data agree with the observations that Wnt5a, but not the Frizzled-1 agonist ligand Wnt3a, stimulates the intracellular Ca2+ response in the F9 clones expressing authentic Rfz2 (data not shown).We explored whether or not G proteins were mediating the Frizzled-2 signaling to the level of NF-AT transcriptional activation. As was observed for the Wnt5a/Ca2+ response, pertussis toxin pretreatment largely abolished the NF-AT-dependent transcriptional response (Fig. 2E). We used morpholino antisense oligonucleotides to suppress the expression of the two pertussis toxin G protein α-subunits, Gαt2 and Gαo, previously shown to mediate Wnt regulation of Ca2+ mobilization and activation of cyclic GMP PDE (13Ahumada A. Slusarski D.C. Liu X. Moon R.T. Malbon C.C. Wang H.Y. Science. 2002; 298: 2006-2010Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The antisense morpholinos were able to knock down the expression of the targeted G protein subunit by more than 75% (Fig. 2E, insets, and Table 1). Knock-down of either Gαt2 or Gαo, but not Gαt1 (control), with antisense morpholinos attenuates the Frizzled-2-mediated activation of NF-AT-dependent transcription (Fig. 2E). Taken together these data demonstrate that NF-AT transcriptional activation by Frizzled-2 is a G protein-mediated downstream readout of the Wnt/Ca2+/cGMP pathway.TABLE 1Efficiency of knockdown of G-protein subunits targeted by antisense morpholinos Open table in a new tab We performed similar diagnostic tests on the role of intracellular Ca2+ on Frizzled-2 regulation of NF-AT-sensitive transcriptional activation.

https://openalex.org/W2079362773,"Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) are a class of enzymes that oxidatively cleave carotenoids into apocarotenoids. Dioxygenases have been identified in plants and animals and produce a wide variety of cleavage products. Despite what is known about apocarotenoids in higher organisms, very little is known about apocarotenoids and CCDs in microorganisms. This study surveyed cleavage activities of ten putative carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases from five different cyanobacteria in recombinant Escherichia coli cells producing different carotenoid substrates. Three CCD homologs identified in Nostoc sp. PCC 7120 were purified, and their cleavage activities were investigated. Two of the three enzymes showed cleavage of β,β-carotene at the 9,10 and 15,15′ positions, respectively. The third enzyme did not cleave full-length carotenoids but cleaved the apocarotenoid β-apo-8′-carotenal at the 9,10 position. 9,10-Apocarotenoid cleavage specificity has previously not been described. The diversity of carotenoid cleavage activities identified in one cyanobacteria suggests that CCDs not only facilitate the degradation of photosynthetic pigments but generate apocarotenals with yet to be determined biological roles in microorganisms."
https://openalex.org/W1983380641,"Abstract Heme (Fe-protoporphyrin IX), an endogenous porphyrin derivative, is an essential molecule in living aerobic organisms and plays a role in a variety of physiological processes such as oxygen transport, respiration, and signal transduction. For the biosynthesis of heme or the mitochondrial heme proteins, heme or its biosynthetic precursor porphyrin must be transported into mitochondria from cytosol. The mechanism of porphyrin accumulation in the mitochondrial inner membrane is unclear. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism of mitochondrial translocation of porphyrin derivatives. We showed that palladium meso-tetra(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (PdTCPP), a phosphorescent porphyrin derivative, accumulated in the mitochondria of several cell lines. Using affinity latex beads, we showed that 2-oxoglutarate carrier (OGC), the mitochondrial transporter of 2-oxoglutarate, bound to PdTCPP, and in vitro PdTCPP inhibited 2-oxoglutarate uptake into mitochondria in a competitive manner (Ki = 15 μm). Interestingly, all types of porphyrin derivatives examined in this study competitively inhibited 2-oxoglutarate uptake into mitochondria, including protoporphyrin IX, coproporphyrin III, and hemin. Furthermore, mitochondrial accumulation of porphyrins was inhibited by 2-oxoglutarate or OGC inhibitor. These results suggested that porphyrin accumulation in mitochondria is mediated by OGC and that porphyrins are able to competitively inhibit 2-oxoglutarate uptake into mitochondria. This is the first report of a putative mechanism for accumulation of porphyrins in the mitochondrial inner membrane."
https://openalex.org/W1983958939,"Calcium can affect myosin V (myoV) function in at least two ways. The full-length molecule, which adopts a folded inhibited conformation in EGTA, becomes extended and active in the presence of calcium. Calcium also dissociates one or more calmodulin molecules from the extended neck. Here we investigated at the single molecule level how calcium regulates the processive run length of full-length myosin V (dFull) and a truncated dimeric construct (dHMM), which cannot adopt the folded conformation. The processivity of dFull and dHMM is tightly controlled by the calcium and calmodulin concentration, with shorter runs occurring at higher calcium concentration. The data indicate that a calcium-dependent dissociation of calmodulin from the neck region of myoV terminates its processive run. dFull showed unexpected processive movement in EGTA, suggesting that a small population of extended, active molecules are in equilibrium with the inhibited, folded form. Single turnover assays showed that the ATPase activity of the folded full-length molecule is inhibited by more than 50-fold compared with the extended molecule. The results imply that activation and termination of the processive runs of myoV can be accomplished by multiple mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2162002172,"Cell-matrix interaction through specific adhesion molecules is a critical step during organ development. In addition, down-regulation of cell adhesion receptors may promote tumor invasion and metastasis. We show here that the Wilms tumor suppressor Wt1, which is necessary for normal development of the epicardium, coronary vessels, genitourinary system, and other tissues, activates transcription of the α4integrin gene. Binding of the Wt1(-KTS) form, which is transcriptionally active, to the proximal α4integrin promoter was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation. A reporter construct harboring ∼1.9 kb of the human α4integrin gene promoter was activated significantly by transient co-transfection of a Wt1(-KTS) expression plasmid. Introducing mutations in two identified Wt1(-KTS) binding motifs in the proximal promoter of the α4integrin gene abrogated this stimulatory effect. Endogenous α4integrin transcripts were increased more than 3-fold in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with stable expression of the Wt1(-KTS) protein. Wt1-overexpressing cells showed augmented adhesion to the α4integrin ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 that was abolished upon incubation with an inhibitory α4integrin antibody. Double immunofluorescent staining revealed co-localization of Wt1 and α4integrin in the developing epicardium of mouse embryos. Cardiac expression of α4integrin was reduced significantly in embryos with a homozygous Wt1 defect (Wt1-/-). These findings demonstrate that Wt1 can support cell adhesion through enhanced expression of α4integrin. This transcriptional activation of the α4integrin gene by Wt1(-KTS) might contribute to normal formation of the epicardium and other tissues in the developing embryo."
https://openalex.org/W2027207299,"We have shown previously that the Src family kinase Lyn is involved in differentiation signals emanating from activated erythropoietin (Epo) receptors. The importance of Lyn to red cell maturation has been highlighted by Lyn-/- mice developing anemia. Here we show that Lyn interacts with C-terminal Src kinase-binding protein (Cbp), an adaptor protein that recruits negative regulators C-terminal Src kinase (Csk)/Csk-like protein-tyrosine kinase (Ctk). Lyn phosphorylated Cbp on several tyrosine residues, including Tyr314, which recruited Csk/Ctk to suppress Lyn kinase activity. Intriguingly, phosphorylated Tyr314 also bound suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), another well characterized negative regulator of cell signaling, resulting in elevated ubiquitination, and degradation of Lyn. In Epo-responsive primary cells and cell lines, Lyn rapidly phosphorylated Cbp, suppressing Lyn kinase activity via Csk/Ctk within minutes of Epo stimulation; hours later, SOCS1 bound to Cbp and was involved in the ubiquitination and turnover of Lyn protein. Thus, a single phosphotyrosine residue on Cbp coordinates a two-phase process involving distinct negative regulatory pathways to inactivate, then degrade, Lyn."
https://openalex.org/W2142004059,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-Tat plays an important role in virus replication and in various aspects of host immune responses, including dysregulation of cytokine production. IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is up-regulated during the course of HIV infection representing an important pathway by which HIV may induce immunodeficiency. Here we show that extracellular as well as intracellular Tat induced IL-10 expression in normal human monocytes and promonocytic THP-1 cells. The signaling pathways involved in the regulation of IL-10 production by endogenous Tat remain unknown. To understand the molecular mechanism underlying intracellular Tat-induced IL-10 transcription, we employed a retroviral expression system to investigate the role of MAPKs and the transcription factor(s) involved. Our results suggest that an inhibitor specific for the ERK1/2, PD98059, selectively blocked intracellular Tat-induced IL-10 expression in THP-1 cells. Furthermore, intracellular Tat activated the CREB-1 transcription factor through Ser(133) phosphorylation that was regulated by ERK MAPK as determined by IL-10 promoter analysis and gel shift assays. Overall, our results suggest that intracellular HIV-Tat induces IL-10 transcription by ERK MAPK-dependent CREB-1 transcription factor activation through Ser(133) phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W1964942433,"Calcium activates full-length myosin Va steady-state enzymatic activity and favors the transition from a compact, folded off state to an extended state. However, little is known of how a head-tail interaction alters the individual actin and nucleotide binding rate and equilibrium constants of the ATPase cycle. We measured the effect of calcium on nucleotide and actin filament binding to full-length myosin Va purified from chick brains. Both heads of nucleotide-free myosin Va bind actin strongly, independent of calcium. In the absence of calcium, bound ADP weakens the affinity of one head for actin filaments at equilibrium and upon initial encounter. The addition of calcium allows both heads of myosin Va.ADP to bind actin strongly. Calcium accelerates ADP binding to actomyosin independent of the tail but minimally affects ATP binding. Although 18O exchange and product release measurements favor a mechanism in which actin-activated Pi release from myosin Va is very rapid, independent of calcium and the tail domain, both heads do not bind actin strongly during steady-state cycling, as assayed by pyrene actin fluorescence. In the absence of calcium, inclusion of ADP favors formation of a long lived myosin Va.ADP state that releases ADP slowly, even after mixing with actin. Our results suggest that calcium activates myosin Va by allowing both heads to interact with actin and exchange bound nucleotide and indicate that regulation of actin binding by the tail is a nucleotide-dependent process favored by linked conformational changes of the motor domain."
https://openalex.org/W1989421311,"Clathrin is a major component of clathrin-coated pits and serves as a binding scaffold for endocytic machinery through the binding of a specific sequence known as the clathrin-binding motif. This motif is also found in cellular signaling proteins other than endocytic components, including G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), which phosphorylates G protein-coupled receptors and promotes uncoupling of receptor-G protein interaction. However, the functions of clathrin in the regulation of GRK2 are unknown. Here we demonstrated that overexpression of GRK2 mutated at the clathrin-binding motif with alanine (GRK2-5A) results in inhibition of phosphorylation and internalization of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR). However, the interaction of β2AR with GRK2-5A is the same as that of wild type GRK2 as determined by bioluminescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, GRK2-5A phosphorylates rhodopsin essentially to the same extent as wild type GRK2 in vitro. Depletion of the clathrin heavy chain using small interference RNA inhibits agonist-induced phosphorylation and internalization of β2AR. Thus, clathrin works as a regulator of GRK2 in cells. These results indicate that clathrin is a novel player in cellular functions in addition to being a component of endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W2066216952,"Phospholemman (PLM), a member of the FXYD family of small ion transport regulators, inhibits cardiac Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX1). NCX1 is made up of N-terminal domain consisting of the first five transmembrane segments (residues 1-217), a large intracellular loop (residues 218-764), and a C-terminal domain comprising the last four transmembrane segments (residues 765-938). Using glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay, we demonstrated that the intracellular loop, but not the N- or C-terminal transmembrane domains of NCX1, was associated with PLM. Further analysis using protein constructs of GST fused to various segments of the intracellular loop of NCX1 suggest that PLM bound to residues 218-371 and 508-764 but not 371-508. Split Na+/Ca2+ exchangers consisting of N- or C-terminal domains with different lengths of the intracellular loop were co-expressed with PLM in HEK293 cells that are devoid of endogenous PLM and NCX1. Although expression of N-terminal but not C-terminal domain alone resulted in correct membrane targeting, co-expression of both N- and C-terminal domains was required for correct membrane targeting and functional exchange activity. NCX1 current measurements indicate that PLM decreased NCX1 current only when the split exchangers contained residues 218-358 of the intracellular loop. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments with PLM and split exchangers suggest that PLM associated with the N-terminal domain of NCX1 when it contained intracellular loop residues 218-358. TM43, a PLM mutant with its cytoplasmic tail truncated, did not co-immunoprecipitate with wild-type NCX1 when co-expressed in HEK293 cells, confirming little to no interaction between the transmembrane domains of PLM and NCX1. We conclude that PLM interacted with the intracellular loop of NCX1, most likely at residues 218-358."

Previously, we identified four tyrosine phosphorylation sites in the amino-terminal domain of villin. In this study we report six new sites in the carboxyl-terminal region of the villin core. With this study we document all phosphorylatable tyrosine residues in villin and map them to functions of villin. In this study, we identify for the first time the functional relevance of the carboxyl-terminal domains of the villin core. Expression of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation site mutant, as well as the villin truncation mutant S1-S3, inhibited cell migration in HeLa and Madin-Darby canine kidney Tet-Off cells, confirming the role of the carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites in villin-induced cell migration. The carboxyl-terminal phosphorylation sites were found to be critical for the interaction of villin with its ligand phospholipase C-gamma1 and for its localization to the developing lamellipodia in a motile cell. The results presented here elucidate the molecular basis for tyrosine-phosphorylated villin-induced changes in cell motility."

The regulation of CheA in the assembly dictates the magnitude and duration of responses to chemotactic stimuli, which reflect inputs originating from different receptors. In reconstituted signaling complexes generated with the aspartate receptor or the serine receptor, ligand-mediated kinase inhibition can exhibit significant positive cooperativity (10Li G. Weis R.M. Cell. 2000; 100: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 13Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Nature. 2004; 428: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). These data suggest that in the cell, receptors are organized in heterogeneous clusters of dimers, which are the cooperative units that regulate CheA (13Sourjik V. Berg H.C. Nature. 2004; 428: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 14Gestwicki J.E. Kiessling L.L. Nature. 2002; 415: 81-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Theories that invoke coupling interactions among receptor dimers in a general way, to account for signal integration and the regulation of kinase activity, provide a satisfactory explanation for the experimental observations of attractant-mediated kinase inhibition (15Bray D. Levin M.D. Morton-Firth C.J. Nature. 1998; 393: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 16Mello B.A. Tu Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Receptor clusters have a hierarchical organization of subunits that is compatible with cooperative mechanisms of enzyme regulation. In this hierarchy, the receptor homodimer is the fundamental unit that defines ligand-binding specificity (reviewed in Ref. 18Falke J.J. Hazelbauer G.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 257-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Fig. 1A depicts an atomic model of a receptor dimer from E. coli (19Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Each monomer consists of a four-helix bundle that (as a dimer) binds ligand (20Ulrich L.E. Zhulin I.B. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2005; 21: 45-48Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), two membrane-spanning helices, and an antiparallel coiled-coil cytoplasmic signaling domain. The overall length of the dimer is ∼300 Å (21Weis R.M. Hirai T. Chalah A. Kessel M. Peters P.J. Subramaniam S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar); the width is about one-tenth the length. Dimers associate further through interactions among cytoplasmic domains and through interactions with CheW and CheA. Both trimer-of-dimers (19Kim K.K. Yokota H. Kim S.H. Nature. 1999; 400: 787-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) and row-of-dimers arrangements (22Park S.Y. Borbat P.P. Gonzalez-Bonet G. Bhatnagar J. Pollard A.M. Freed J.H. Bilwes A.M. Crane B.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol.,. 2006; 13: 400-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) have been observed in crystals of the cytoplasmic domain fragment, which are postulated to form the basis of the receptor-CheW-CheA signaling arrays (22Park S.Y.

Le Novere N. Levin M.D. Beavil A.J. Sutton B.J. Bray D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 792-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Structure-guided mutagenesis and cross-linking experiments that sought to find interactions between cytoplasmic domains near the sites of CheW and CheA binding have provided evidence for such interactions. These interactions occur between receptor dimers that differ in the ligand binding specificity, which are interpreted in support of receptor signaling teams (5Ames P. Studdert C.A. Reiser R.H. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7060-7065Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 24Studdert C.A. Parkinson J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 2117-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Point mutations in the cytoplasmic domain characterized during the course of these and other studies (25Mutoh N. Oosawa K. Simon M.I. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 992-998Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have strong effects on signaling and are thus useful reagents for understanding CheA regulation. Some of the mutations used in this study are shown in Fig. 1B. In some cases the mutations can be located far from the CheA- and CheW-binding sites, but significant influences on CheA activity are observed nonetheless. The basis for these effects is not understood. Reconstituted assemblies of the intact receptor have generated important insights into the cooperative nature of CheA regulation. Yet these samples are complex (21Weis R.M. Hirai T. Chalah A. Kessel M. Peters P.J. Subramaniam S. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 3636-3643Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the difficulties that plague the use of transmembrane proteins create significant problems for quantitative studies. To circumvent these difficulties and still retain the key features of the core signaling complex, we used template-directed self-assembly of receptor signaling complexes (Fig. 1C) (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In this method, the histidine-tagged cytoplasmic domain fragment of the aspartate receptor (CF) 3The abbreviations used are: CF, cytoplasmic fragment; WT-CF, wild type CF; NS-CF, nonstimulating CF; ST-CF, kinase-stimulating CF; fB, fraction of CheA or CheW bound to vesicles; Ni2+-DOGS, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-{[N(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl)iminodiacetic acid]succinyl} (nickel salt); DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine; NLSF, nonlinear least squares fit. has a specific binding interaction with a Ni2+-chelating phospholipid in the outer leaflet of unilamellar vesicles. CheW and CheA then bind to the CF to form functional signaling complexes (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Template-directed assembly has been used here to investigate the properties of CheA regulation in receptor clusters involving mixtures of CFs. Through the use of the mutated forms of the CFs that have altered protein interaction strengths, we demonstrate that the CF alone has the necessary domain interactions to generate cooperative CheA binding and inhibition. Moreover, binary mixtures of stimulating and nonstimulating CFs reveal competition among CFs in binding and stimulating the kinase. We suggest that both processes contribute to the regulation of CheA in the cell, which taken together can help explain how chemotactic stimuli are channeled through heterogeneous receptor clusters. Proteins and Protein Purification—Histidine-tagged CFs of the aspartate receptor were prepared from the expression plasmids pSM100, pHTCF, and pSM101, which produced CF in low (CF4E), intermediate (CFQEQE), and high (CF4Q) levels of glutamine modification to mimic receptor methylation (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Primer-directed PCR mutagenesis (Stratagene, San Diego) was used to introduce the point mutations listed in Table 1. All mutations were verified by sequencing (Davis Sequencing, Davis, CA). CheY, CheA, and CheW were prepared as described previously (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M.

Open table in a new tab Lipid Vesicles—Sonicated unilamellar vesicles were prepared from chloroform solutions of Ni2+-DOGS and DOPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL), which were mixed to give a 1.5:1 molar ratio, evaporated to dryness under a stream of gaseous N2, and resuspended in kinase assay buffer (75 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 5% Me2SO) at 1 mg/ml total lipid. The suspension was sonicated for ∼90 min at 25 °C, which resulted in a transparent solution. Kinase Assay—A coupled ATPase assay was used to measure steady-state kinase activity of CheA in template-assembled complexes (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Typical lipid and protein concentrations were 150 μm accessible Ni2+-DOGS, 30 μm CF, 1.2 μm CheA, and either 4 or 15 μm CheW (with CF4Q and CF4E, respectively). Complex assembly was allowed to proceed for 4 h at 25°C. After the complexes were assembled, the activity was measured immediately after 100-fold dilution into a solution that also contained 1 mm ATP and 50 μm CheY. The activity of vesicle-bound CheA (s–1) was computed from the measured activity (dc/dt) divided by the concentration of vesicle-bound CheA (fB × [CheA]total). All data points are averages of at least two independent measurements, and the error bars are standard deviations. Measurements of Complex Assembly—The fractions of vesicle-bound CheA and CheW (fB) were measured under the same conditions used to assemble CF-CheW-CheA complexes. Aliquots removed prior to and after centrifugation (15 min at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman 120.2 rotor and TLX centrifuge) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed with scanning densitometry (Bio-Rad model GS-700 densitometer) to estimate the total and free concentrations of protein, respectively, from which fB was computed. Binding Experiments—The vesicle sedimentation method was also used to estimate association constants and binding capacities of the surface-templated CFs for CheW and CheA. These experiments used vesicles with a 1.5 to 1 molar ratio of Ni2+-DOGS to DOPC at a total lipid concentration of 500 and 30 μm CF. Under these conditions all the CF cosedimented with vesicles (with an approximate limit of detection of 1% in the supernatant fraction). Binding isotherms were fit to a single site model using Origin 7.5 (Northampton, MA) as shown in Equation 1, [P]bound=n·[P]free(KA-1+[P]free)(Eq.1) where [P]bound and [P]free are bound and free protein concentrations (CheW or CheA), respectively; KA is the association constant, and n is the concentration of binding sites. Models of CheA Activity and Complex Formation—Specific activity and ternary complex formation data were modeled to discern the nature of the competitive and cooperative interactions. The overlapping site model assumed the following: (i) that CheW (W) and CheA (A) bound competitively to the same site, or overlapping sites, on the CF (C); (ii) bound with different affinities to WT- and NS-CFs (Co and C*, respectively), and (iii) the C-W and C-A affinities were influenced similarly by the mutation introduced into C, i.e. R = KC*A/KCoA = KC*W/KCoW. The CheA activity on binary CF mixtures is then given by Equation 2, Act=Acto[CoA]+Act*[C*A][CoA]+[C*A](Eq.2) where Acto and Act* are the CheA activities bound to 100% WT-CF and 100% NS-CF arrays, respectively; and [CoA] and [C*A] are the CheA concentrations bound to WT- and NS-CFs, respectively (in the presence of CheW), estimated through the model with constraints imposed by the activity and binding data. A second competitive model based on bridging interactions was also explored (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) but proved to be unsatisfactory in fitting both activity and binding data. The implementation of the overlapping site and bridging models are described in the Appendix and the supplemental material, respectively. Cooperative changes in CheA activity and the fraction of bound CheA, fB, were fit to Equation 3, Act=Acto-ΔActXnX1/2n+Xn(Eq.3) where Act is the activity (s–1) of vesicle-bound CheA for a given value of X, the NS-CF mole fraction. Acto is the activity when X = 0, and ΔAct is the difference in activity at X = 0 and X = 1. X is equal to X½ when Act equals Acto – ΔAct/2, and n is the cooperativity coefficient. Equation 3 was also used to analyze cooperative changes in fB, except that Act, Acto, and ΔAct were replaced by the experimental values of fB, an estimate for fB with vesicles of 100% WT-CF fBo, and the difference in fB between 100% WT-CF and 100% NS-CF (ΔfB). Assembly and Activity of Receptor Complexes—Fig. 1C depicts CF-CheW-CheA complexes assembled on a lipid bilayer. Previously, these complexes had been assembled on vesicles to demonstrate that wild type CF (WT-CF) stimulated CheA at all levels of adaptational modification (26Shrout A.L. Montefusco D.J. Weis R.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 13379-13385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Here these template-assembled complexes were used to determine the requirements for kinase stimulation. Several CFs, each containing a point mutation known to interfere with stimulation (NS-CFs), were tested and compared with WT-CF. The positions of these mutations in the sequence of the intact receptor and their known properties are summarized in Table 1. Vesicles were also decorated with equimolar WT-CF/NS-CF mixtures to assess the impact of having stimulating and nonstimulating CFs present simultaneously. The specific activities (s–1) of the CheA bound to vesicles decorated with WT-CF, NS-CF, or a 1:1 WT-CF/NS-CF mixture are plotted in Fig. 2, A–D, and E–H shows the fraction of CheA bound to these vesicles (fB (CheA)), and I–L shows the fraction of bound CheW (fB (CheW)). The activities reported in Fig. 2, and elsewhere under “Results,” assumed that only vesicle-bound CheA contributed significantly to activity, which was possible because the specific activity of CheA in solution was small by comparison (<0.1 s–1), and in the majority of cases the activities in the presence of CF-decorated vesicles and CheW were at least 10-fold greater (>1.0 s–1). The experiments depicted in Fig. 2 were conducted with CFs in the two extremes of covalent modification, where glutamine (Q) residues were substituted for glutamate (E) residues at the four major methylation sites (CF4Q and CF4E, filled and open symbols, respectively) (27Terwilliger T.C. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 7719-7725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glutamine substitution mimics the effect of receptor methylation, which is involved in the process of adaptation during bacterial chemotaxis (28Dunten P. Koshland Jr., D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1491-1496Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Borkovich K.A. Alex L.A. Simon M.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6756-6760Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the basis of kinase activity, the NS-CFs were sorted into two groups, inhibitory (Fig. 2, A and C) and permissive (Fig. 2, B and D). CheA activity dropped progressively in the inhibitory group as the mole fraction of NS-CF increased. In contrast, CheA bound to 1:1 mixtures of WT-CF and NS-CFs from the permissive group remained fully stimulated. In some cases the retention of activity depended on covalent modification (Fig. 2, B and D). Operationally, the retention of full CheA activity in the WT-CF4Q/NS-CF4Q mixture was deemed sufficient to classify a mutation as permissive, whether or not full activity was also retained with the WT-CF4E/NS-CF4E mixture. The inhibitory and permissive mutations also had distinct effects on CF-CheW-CheA interactions, which were evident in fB (CheA) and fB (CheW), shown in Fig. 2, E–H and I–L, respectively. None of the permissive NS-CFs were as effective as WT-CF at complex formation; fB was significantly lower for both CheA and CheW (Fig. 2, F, H, J, and L). That only small levels of CheA and CheW binding were observed with the permissive CFs (V382P especially) eliminated the possibility that CheA and CheW bound to vesicles nonspecifically. By contrast, two inhibitory NS-CFs (S325L, L376A) promoted CheA and CheW binding at extents comparable with, or greater than, WT-CF (Fig. 2, E, G, I, and K). Thus, these inhibitory NS-CFs lowered CheA activity through a strong competition for CheW and CheA. The S461L NS-CF was also classified as inhibitory, despite the fact that it was less efficient in forming signaling complexes. As described below, the S461L NS-CF inhibited CheA in a qualitatively different manner. The binding of CheW and CheA to CF-decorated vesicles was assessed by sedimentation in a separate set of experiments. Fig. 3 plots CheW binding to the WT-CF and various NS-CFs in low and high levels of covalent modification (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively). The binding affinities and capacities, which were estimated with a single site binding model (Equation 1), are summarized in Table 2. The introduction of inhibitory mutations (S325L and L376A) generated measurable increases in binding affinity, whereas the permissive mutations (I375P, V382P, and E383A) reduced the binding strength by large amounts.TABLE 2Parameters of CheW binding to template-assembled CFsCFKCWConcentration of sitesCF4ECF4QCF4ECF4Qμm-1μmWT0.08 ± 0.010.13 ± 0.0221.0 ± 2.118.8 ± 2.4S325L0.20 ± 0.020.37 ± 0.0618.7 ± 1.515.1 ± 0.9L376A0.26 ± 0.031.42 ± 0.2519.3 ± 3.419.1 ± 1.4S461L0.01 ± 0.010.01 ± 0.0120aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.20aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.I375P<0.01<0.0120aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.20aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.V382P<0.01<0.0120aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.20aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.E383A<0.01<0.0120aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.20aThe binding site concentrations were fixed to this value.a The binding site concentrations were fixed to this value. Open table in a new tab In the case of WT-CF and the strong-binding inhibitory CFs, estimates for the total concentration of binding sites were generated in fits of the data to the single-site model. These values, which ranged from 15 to 21 μm, were generally smaller than the total CF concentration used in the experiment (30 μm). Although the binding ratios calculated with these results are approximately consistent with a 1:1 CheW/CF binding ratio, which has been reported previously (11Levit M.N. Grebe T.W. Stock J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36748-36754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 30Boukhvalova M.S. Dahlquist F.W. Stewart R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22251-22259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), they are similarly consistent with a 1:2 interaction. The origin of the substoichiometric binding, i.e. less than one CheW per CF, is not known, but it could be because of incomplete assembly of the cytoplasmic domains on the vesicle surface, such as dimerization. On the other hand, the effects of the mutations on the CheW binding strength could not be clearer. The inhibitory mutations S325L and L376A produced significant increases in strength, whereas the permissive mutations (I375P, V382P, and E383A) have much lowered interaction strengths. These effects clearly impact the manner and efficiency with which the cytoplasmic domain forms active signaling complexes with CheW and CheA. A limited number of vesicle binding experiments were conducted with CheA. Fig. 4 shows that CheA exhibited saturable binding to CF-"

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) 4The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls; HOPDA, 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-2,4-dienoate; TCHQ, tetrachlorohydroquinone; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GS, deprotonated GSH. 4The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; PCB, polychlorinated biphenyls; HOPDA, 3-chloro-2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-2,4-dienoate; TCHQ, tetrachlorohydroquinone; MES, 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid; CDNB, 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene; GS, deprotonated GSH. transform a wide variety of electrophilic compounds in a reaction typically involving GSH (γ-l-Glu-l-Cys-Gly) conjugation (1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Best known for their roles in detoxification in eukaryotes, GSTs are also broadly distributed in prokaryotes as homo- or heterodimers with ∼25-kDa subunits (2Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1665) Google Scholar). To date, GSTs have been grouped into at least 12 distinct classes on the basis of substrate specificity and primary structure (3Vuilleumier S. Pagni M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The nomenclature is in flux due to the continued identification of new GSTs, particularly in prokaryotes (3Vuilleumier S. Pagni M. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 58: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 4Oakley A.J. Curr. Opin. Stuct. Biol. 2005; : 716-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Despite low sequence identity, all GSTs share a conserved two-domain structure (5Vuilleumier S. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1431-1441Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in which the N-terminal domain consists of a central core of a mixed four- or five-stranded β sheet buttressed by a pair of α helices, and the C-terminal domain is entirely α helical (1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 6Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 7Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The active site architecture is formed in part from two binding subsites located at the interface of two adjacent monomers. The G-subsite binds GSH, and the H-subsite binds hydrophobic electrophiles (8Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Allocati N. Masulli M. De Illio C. Parker M.W. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Most eukaryotic GSTs consume a single GSH that is conjugated to an electrophilic substrate during catalytic turnover (1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Bacterial GSTs function in a wide range of detoxification and catabolic pathways (9Di Ilio C. Aceto A. Piccolomini R. Allocati N. Faraone A. Cellini L. Ravagnan G. Federici G. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 10Iizuka M. Inoue Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 6039-6042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Arca P. Garcia P. Hardisson C. Suarez J.E. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Moreover, they display considerable diversity with respect to the utilization of GSH. For example, enzymes such as maleylacetoacetate and maleylpyruvate isomerases utilize but do not consume GSH (12Polekhina G. Board P.G. Blackburn A.C. Parker M.W. Biochem. J. 2001; 40: 1567-1576Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some bacterial GSTs, such as tetrachloro-hydroquinone (TCHQ) dehalogenase from Sphingomonas chlorophenolica, consume two GSH equivalents (13Anandarajah K. Kiefer Jr., P.M. Donohoe B.S. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5303-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The first GSH is used in the dehalogenation step leading to the formation of a mixed disulfide with the enzyme. The second equivalent of GSH is used to regenerate the free enzyme, yielding a disulfide-bridged product, GSSG. In a variation of this theme, the catabolism of lignin derivatives by Sphingomonas paucimobilis SYK-6 also consumes two GSH molecules but requires two enzymes to do so; LigF and LigG catalyze glutathione conjugations similar to eukaryotic enzymes and GSSG formation, respectively (14Masai E. Katayama Y. Nishikawa S. Fukuda M. J. Ind. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1999; 23: 364-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Masai E. Ichimura A. Sato Y. Miyauchi K. Katayama Y. Fukuda M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 1768-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). All of these GSTs are thought to involve GSH conjugation. However, their structural basis is poorly understood. Insights obtained from the reported crystal structures of bacterial GSTs (8Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Allocati N. Masulli M. De Illio C. Parker M.W. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 16Nishida M. Harada S. Noguchi S. Satow Y. Inoue H. Takahashi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) are limited as the second physiological substrates for these enzymes are unknown. The structure of PmGST B1-1 from Proteus mirabilis reveals the binding of GSH to the G-subsite with the thiol group covalently attached to Cys-10 (8Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Allocati N. Masulli M. De Illio C. Parker M.W. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). PmGST B1-1 binds antibiotics such as tetracyclines and rifamycin but at a site remote from the H-subsite (17Perito B. Allocati N. Casalone E. Masulli M. Dragani B. Polsinelli M. Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarly, the structure of an Escherichia coli GST was determined in a complex with the inhibitor glutathione sulfonate (N-(N-γ-l-glutamyl-3-sulfo-l-alanyl)-glycine) (16Nishida M. Harada S. Noguchi S. Satow Y. Inoue H. Takahashi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), a GSH analogue. In this structure, Cys-10 and His-106 form hydrogen bonds to the glutathione sulfonate inhibitor; however, the bulky sulfonate group is unlikely to mimic a transition state (16Nishida M. Harada S. Noguchi S. Satow Y. Inoue H. Takahashi K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 281: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In many eukaryotic GSTs, Tyr-5 and Ser-11 are catalytically essential residues that are located in proximity to the sulfur atom of the bound GSH (8Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Allocati N. Masulli M. De Illio C. Parker M.W. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 18Sheehan D. Meade G. Foley V.M. Dowd C.A. Biochem. J. 2001; 360: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). In the bacterial GSTs, these residues are not in contact with the bound GSH. Instead, two conserved residues, Cys-10 and His-106, interact directly with the GSH substrate and are ascribed catalytic roles (8Rossjohn J. Polekhina G. Feil S.C. Allocati N. Masulli M. De Illio C. Parker M.W. Structure (Lond.). 1998; 6: 721-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis studies using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) as a reporter substrate failed to identify active site residues that activate the glutathione (19Casalone E. Allocati N. Ceccarelli I. Masulli M. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Di Ilio C. FEBS Lett. 1998; 423: 122-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 20Allocati N. Casalone E. Masulli M. Polekhina G. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 341-346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The bphK gene of Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 encodes a GST that is part of the bph (biphenyl catabolic) pathway (21Hofer B. Backhaus S. Timmis K.N. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 144: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The latter is responsible for the aerobic catabolism of biphenyl and the transformation of some polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Biphenyl catabolism is typical of the aerobic catabolism of aromatic compounds in that it proceeds via a catechol, in this case 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl (22Furukawa K. J. Gen. Appl. Microbiol. 2000; 46: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The extradiol cleavage of the latter produces 2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenyl-2,4-dienoate (HOPDA), which is hydrolyzed to benzoate and 2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate in a reaction catalyzed by BphD. BphD is competitively inhibited by 3-Cl and 4-Cl HOPDAs (23Seah S.Y.K. Labbe G. Nerdinger S. Johnson M.R. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). BphK is not essential for growth of B. xenovorans LB400 on biphenyl (24Bartels F. Backhaus S. Moore E.R.B. Timmis K.N. Hofer B. Microbiology (Read.). 1999; 145: 2821-2834Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); however, BphK was shown recently to dechlorinate 3-Cl and 5-Cl HOPDAs (25Fortin P.D. Horsman G.P. Yang H.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This activity would alleviate inhibition of the bph pathway by these PCB metabolites and likely contributes to the potent PCB-degrading ability of B. xenovorans LB400 (25Fortin P.D. Horsman G.P. Yang H.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reductive dehalogenation catalyzed by BphK is similar to that of TCHQ dehalogenase from S. chlorophenolica (26Kiefer Jr., P.M. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) in that it consumes two GSH equivalents (13Anandarajah K. Kiefer Jr., P.M. Donohoe B.S. Copley S.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5303-5311Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The BphK-catalyzed dehalogenation of 3-Cl HOPDA is proposed to proceed via either a simple addition of GSH followed by elimination of chloride or an SN2-mediated displacement (25Fortin P.D. Horsman G.P. Yang H.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The second equivalent of GSH is used to regenerate the free enzyme. To investigate the unusual catalytic mechanism of BphK and to probe the structural basis for catalysis in bacterial GSTs, we have obtained structural data for two ternary complexes of this enzyme. Each structure provides unique insights into the catalytic cycle of GSTs. In one structure, a HOPDA molecule (the dechlorinated product of 3-Cl HOPDA) and a GSH molecule are bound at the active site (BphK-GSH-HOPDA). In the other structure, two GSH molecules are bound at the active site of the enzyme (BphK-(GSH)2). These structures support and extend the recently proposed mechanism (25Fortin P.D. Horsman G.P. Yang H.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the structures reveal surprising flexibility of the active site to accommodate both HOPDA and GSH molecules at the H-subsite. BphK was heterologously expressed in E. coli GJ1158 and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin as described previously (25Fortin P.D. Horsman G.P. Yang H.M. Eltis L.D. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4424-4430Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The stock BphK solution used in crystallization experiments contained 65 mg/ml of protein, 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and 10 mm GSH. The reservoir solution was 0.8-1.2 m K+/Na+ tartrate, 0.1 m MES, pH 6. BphK was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion using a 1:1 ratio of reservoir to protein, and crystals grew within a week. Two co-crystallization experiments were performed: one with HOPDA and GSH and one with GSH alone. In the first experiment, the protein was diluted 1:1 with a buffer containing 2mm HOPDA, 10 mm glutathione, and 50 mm Tris, pH 7. Before mounting, the crystals were soaked for an additional 30 min in 10 mm HOPDA, produced as described previously (23Seah S.Y.K. Labbe G. Nerdinger S. Johnson M.R. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the second co-crystallization experiment, the protein was diluted 1:1 with a buffer containing 10 mm GSH and 50 mm Tris, pH 7. All crystals were transferred into mother liquor supplemented to 30% glycerol as a cryo-protectant. The BphK-GSH-HOPDA co-crystals grew in space group R3 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 112.2 Å, c = 221.9 Å, and two dimers in the asymmetric unit (A-B, C-D). The BphK-(GSH)2 co-crystals grew in space group P65 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 103.4 Å, c = 282.3 Å and three dimers (A-B, C-D, E-F) in the asymmetric unit. Data sets were collected at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) BL 9-1 to 2.1 Å resolution. The data were processed with DENZO and scaled with SCALEPACK (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38250) Google Scholar). The overall Wilson B-factors were 42 and 30 Å2 for the BphK-GSH-HOPDA and BphK-(GSH)2 structures, respectively. The structure of a bacterial GST from S. paucimobilis (Protein Data Bank entry code 1F2E) with all non-conserved residues set to alanines was used as a starting model for molecular replacement using the program AMoRe with data to 2.8 Å resolution (28Collaborative Computational Project, N.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19667) Google Scholar). The two proteins share 54% amino acid sequence identity, and the correlation coefficient and R-factor of the top solution were 0.59 and 0.53, respectively.

Open table in a new tab The BphK-GSH-HOPDA structure was refined using Ref-mac5 (29Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13712) Google Scholar). Five percent of the data were set aside to calculate the free R-factor (30Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 355: 472-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (3837) Google Scholar). Models were built and visualized using the program O (31Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar). Electron density was observed at each of the four G-subsites, and GSH molecules were modeled at full occupancy. Electron density for the HOPDA molecule was present in all monomers and when modeled at half-occupancy, refined with an average B-factor of 42 Å2. The final model of the BphK-GSH-HOPDA complex contains four monomers, four GSH molecules, four HOPDA molecules, and 498 water molecules. The BphK-(GSH)2 structure was refined using CNS (32Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges N. Pannu N.S. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16917) Google Scholar). The crystal was almost perfectly twinned (33Yeates T.O. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 344-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar); the twin fraction for refinement and map calculations was refined to 0.45. Each of the six monomers contains one GSH substrate at the G-subsite. In three out of the six monomers, additional electron density was observed at the H-subsite and was modeled as a second GSH molecule. The occupancy of these second GSH molecules in monomers B, D, and F was set to 0.5, and the average B-factors were refined to 35 Å2. The final model of the BphK-(GSH)2 structure consists of six peptide chains, nine GSH molecules, and 216 water molecules. Ramachandran plots of the main chain torsional angles in each structure show that 95.0% of the residues are in the most favored regions, and none are observed in the disallowed regions as defined by PRO-CHECK (34Laskowski R.A. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 231: 1049-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar). The Overall Structure—The crystal structures of BphK-GSH-HOPDA and BphK-(GSH)2 have two and three dimers in the asymmetric unit, respectively. The overall fold of BphK in the two structures is essentially identical (Fig. 1, C and D). The root mean square deviation of the CA positions on superposition between each of the respective dimer pairs is less than 0.2 Å. Moreover, the main protein fold and subunit arrangement in the dimer are similar to those of other GSTs (1Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar, 6Dirr H. Reinemer P. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 220: 645-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar, 7Wilce M.C. Parker M.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1205: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Briefly, the monomer is comprised of two domains. The N-terminal domain (residues 1-79) contains a βαββ module (residues 1-38) connected to a ββα module (residues 54-77) via a long surface-exposed loop. A 12-residue linker connects the N-terminal domain to the C-terminal domain (residues 89-202). The latter domain contains five α helices. Each homodimer contains two equivalent active sites, which are found at clefts formed at the interface between the monomers (Fig. 1, C and D). A small portion of the active site cleft is formed by residues derived from the other monomer in the dimer (Fig. 2, A and B). The active site is comprised of two subsites, a common GSH binding site (G-subsite) and an H-subsite that typically binds the electrophilic second substrate of the reaction.FIGURE 2The active sites of the BphK-GSH-HOPDA ternary complex (A) and the BphK-(GSH)2 ternary complex (B). Residues comprising the active site, the bound HOPDA, and the GSH molecules are shown as ball-and-stick models. Carbon atoms are colored yellow (GSH and HOPDA) and orange (amino acid side chains), nitrogen atoms are colored blue, oxygen atoms are colored red, and sulfur atoms are colored green.

The average B-factor of the atoms of the six GSH molecules is 41 Å2, indicating that these sites are fully occupied and that the bound molecules are well ordered. The glycyl moiety is orientated toward the surface of the protein, whereas the γ-glutamyl moiety is directed toward the core of the protein. The main interactions of the glycyl moiety are three hydrogen bonds involving Lys-35 and Val-52. The thiol of GSH forms a hydrogen bond with Cys-10 SG (3.0-3.1 Å) and is near to His-106 NE2 (3.6-3.8 Å). Three hydrogen bonds from the bound GSH are formed with residues from the adjacent monomer: Asn-99, Ser-103, and Glu-104. In addition, the γ-glutamyl moiety interacts with Glu-65 (a hydrogen bond) and Tyr-51 (hydrophobic interactions).TABLE 2Hydrogen bonds and distancesInteractionsDistancesaRange of distances over all the monomers in the asymmetric unit with both ligands bound.BphK-GSH-HOPDABphK-(GSH)2ÅBphK-BphKHis-106 NE2-Cys-10 SG4.17-4.303.83-3.93His-106 ND1-Tyr-157 OH2.73-2.832.57-2.65BphK-G-subsite ligandHis-106 NE2-GSH SG23.60-3.793.72-3.85Cys-10 SG-GSH SG23.00-3.093.10-3.37Glu-65 OE2-GSH N12.70-2.792.60-2.83Ser-103 OGbResidues from adjacent subunit.-GSH N12.97-3.073.00-3.05Asn-99 ND2bResidues from adjacent subunit.-GSH O123.40-3.472.90-3.31Gly-66 N-GSH O113.09-3.192.99-3.07Glu-104 OE1bResidues from adjacent subunit.-GSH N12.59-2.702.77-2.94Lys-107 NZ-GSH OE13.66-3.913.38-3.43Val-52 O-GSH N22.77-2.902.68-2.93Val-52 N-GSH O22.78-2.872.89-3.19Lys-35 NZ-GSH O312.96-4.802.64-2.98BphK-H-subsite ligandHis-106 NE2-GSH O313.27-3.44Ser-110 OG-GSH O312.38-2.84His-106 NE2-HPDcHPD, abbreviation for HOPDA molecule.

Open table in a new tab After refinement with GSH molecules bound at each of the four G-subsites and computing a difference map, strong electron density was observed in all of the monomers at the H-subsite adjacent to the modeled GSH. This density was fit and refined with a HOPDA molecule (Fig. 1A) in the trans transoid configuration of the enol tautomer, the predominant form in solution (23Seah S.Y.K. Labbe G. Nerdinger S. Johnson M.R. Snieckus V. Eltis L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15701-15708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 35Catelani D. Colombi A. Biochem. J. 1974; 143: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A HOPDA restraint library was created using the Monomer Library Sketcher within Refmac5. The enol tautomer is defined by CA2=CA3 and CA4=CA5 double bonds, whereas the keto tautomer is defined by a CA3=CA4 double bond (Fig. S2). When the keto form of the HOPDA molecule was modeled, the fit of the dienoate moiety was poor due to the disallowed rotation of the CA3=CA4 double bond. When compared with the G-subsite, the H-subsite is more solvent-accessible, and BphK makes fewer direct interactions with the HOPDA product. Nonetheless, the HOPDA molecule refines with B-factors similar to those of the BphK atoms that form the H-subsite. The H-subsite is lined mainly with aromatic residues: Tyr-167, Phe-113, and Trp-164 (Fig. 2A). The base of this subsite is constructed from the peptide chain of Gly-8 and Ala-9. Only three hydrogen bonds are formed with the HOPDA molecule, and all involve the carboxylate oxygen atoms. Two of these hydrogen bonds are with Ser-110 OG, and one is with His-106 NE2 (Table 2). The single direct contact involving the two bound molecules in each subsite is a van der Waals interaction (∼3.3 Å) between the GSH thiol and carbon 3 of the HOPDA molecule (Fig. 2A). Importantly, this carbon is chlorinated in the physiological substrate. BphK:(GSH)2 Complex—As in the BphK-GSH-HOPDA structure, the BphK-(GSH)2 structure shows well defined electron density for a GSH molecule found in the G-subsite (Fig. 1B). The GSH molecule is in an extended conformation similar to the binding mode of the GSH molecule in the BphK-GSH-HOPDA structure. A shift of the glycyl moiety (corresponding to ∼3.0 Å for the carboxylate oxygen atoms) is observed between the two structures (Fig. 2C). All the G-subsite protein-GSH interactions observed in the BphK-GSH-HOPDA structure are conserved in the BphK-(GSH)2 structure (Table 2). An additional hydrogen bond is formed between Lys-107 NZ and OE1 of the GSH molecule bound at the G-subsite. More importantly, the position of the GSH sulfur atom with respect to Cys-10 SG and to His-106 NE2 is similar in the two structures (distances of 3.1-3.4 and 3.7-3.9 Å, respectively). When modeled in at full occupancy, the average B-factor of the GSH molecules was refined to 31 Å2. A second GSH molecule is observed at the H-subsite in three out of the six monomers (Figs. 1B and 2B). Although the second GSH was modeled at partial occupancy, clear density extends over the molecule, and the sulfur atom occupies the highest peak in an omit difference map (Fig. 1B). Similar to the binding of the HOPDA molecule, this second GSH molecule is sand-wiched between the first GSH in the G-subsite and a hydrophobic pocket created by Tyr-167, Trp-164, and Phe-113. Only two hydrogen bonds are observed between the second GSH molecule and the protein. These interactions are between the glycyl carboxylate oxygen O31 of the GSH molecule and the residues His-106 and Ser-110 (Fig. 2B, Table 2). This second GSH molecule is also bound in an extended conformation; however, the glycyl moiety is orientated toward Cys-10, and the γ-glutamyl moiety lies at the surface of the protein. As a result, the second GSH molecule is approximately antiparallel to the GSH molecule in the G-subsite such that the GSH sulfur atoms are 4.1-4.7 Å apart. Notably, His-106 NE2 serves as a bridge between the two GSH molecules by forming hydrogen bonds to the SG2 atom of GSH in G-subsite and O31 of GSH bound at the H-subsite (Table 2). Structural Plasticity in the H-Subsite—BphK is typical of GSTs in that it binds a GSH molecule at its G-subsite and a second substrate at its H-subsite. Our crystal structures demonstrate the ability of the H-subsite of the enzyme to accommodate both a product and subsequently a second GSH molecule to accomplish the reductive dechlorination reaction. This flexibility seems to be linked to two properties of the H-subsite: a predominantly hydrophobic ch"
https://openalex.org/W2005579453,"Myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 3 (MYPT3) and transforming growth factor-β-inhibited membrane-associated protein (TIMAP) are two closely related myosin-binding targeting subunits of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) with a characteristic CAAX (where AA indicates aliphatic amino acid) box at the C termini. Here we show that MYPT3 can be a substrate for protein kinase A (PKA). We first mapped the multiple phosphorylation sites within a central conserved motif. Deletion or mutations of this motif resulted in enhancement of the associated PP1c activity, suggesting that phosphorylation of MYPT3 may play an important role in regulating PP1c catalytic activity. However, unlike the other known MYPTs, which upon phosphorylation inhibit PP1c, PKA phosphorylation of MYPT3 resulted in PP1c activation, indicating a different mode of action. There is a direct interaction between the central conserved phosphorylated site motif with the N-terminal ankyrin repeat region; this interaction was significantly reduced with MYPT3 phosphorylation or acidic phosphorylation site mutations, with concomitant alterations in biochemical and morphological consequences. We therefore propose a novel mechanism for the phosphorylation of MYPT3 by PKA and activation of the catalytic activity through direct interaction of a central region of MYPT3 with its N-terminal region."
https://openalex.org/W1971564809,"Human organic anion transporter hOAT1 plays critical roles in the body disposition of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs. In the present study, we examined the role of the C terminus of hOAT1 in its function. Combined approaches of cell surface biotinylation and transport analysis were employed for such purposes. It was found that deletion of the last 15 amino acids (residues 536-550) or the last 30 amino acids (residues 521-550) had no significant effect on transport activity. However, deletion of the entire C terminus (residues 506-550) completely abolished transport activity. Alanine scanning mutagenesis within the region of amino acids 506-520 led to the discovery of two critical amino acids: Glu-506 and Leu-512. Substitution of negatively charged Glu-506 with neutral amino acids alanine or glutamine resulted in complete loss of transport activity. However, such loss of transport activity could be rescued by substitution of Glu-506 with another negatively charged amino acid aspartic acid, suggesting the importance of negative charge at this position for maintaining the correct tertiary structure of the transporter, possibly by forming a salt bridge with a positively charged amino acid. Substitution of Leu-512 with amino acids carrying progressively smaller side chains including isoleucine, valine, and alanine resulted in mutants (L512I, L512V, and L512A) with increasingly impaired transport activity. However, the cell surface expression of these mutants was not affected. Kinetic analysis of mutant L512V revealed that the reduced transport activity of this mutant resulted mainly from a reduced maximum transport velocity Vmax without affecting the binding affinity (1/Km) of the transporter for its substrates, suggesting that the size of the side chain at position 512 critically affects transporter turnover number. Together, our results are the first to highlight the central role of the C terminus of hOAT1 in the function of this transporter."
