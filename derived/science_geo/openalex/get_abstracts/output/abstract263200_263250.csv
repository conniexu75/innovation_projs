https://openalex.org/W2081717721,"Integral β-barrel proteins are found in the outer membranes of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and Gram-negative bacteria. The machine that assembles these proteins contains an integral membrane protein, called YaeT in Escherichia coli , which has one or more polypeptide transport–associated (POTRA) domains. The crystal structure of a periplasmic fragment of YaeT reveals the POTRA domain fold and suggests a model for how POTRA domains can bind different peptide sequences, as required for a machine that handles numerous β-barrel protein precursors. Analysis of POTRA domain deletions shows which are essential and provides a view of the spatial organization of this assembly machine."

https://openalex.org/W2059000517,"In Gram-negative bacteria and eukaryotic organelles, beta-barrel proteins of the outer membrane protein 85-two-partner secretion B (Omp85-TpsB) superfamily are essential components of protein transport machineries. The TpsB transporter FhaC mediates the secretion of Bordetella pertussis filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA). We report the 3.15 A crystal structure of FhaC. The transporter comprises a 16-stranded beta barrel that is occluded by an N-terminal alpha helix and an extracellular loop and a periplasmic module composed of two aligned polypeptide-transport-associated (POTRA) domains. Functional data reveal that FHA binds to the POTRA 1 domain via its N-terminal domain and likely translocates the adhesin-repeated motifs in an extended hairpin conformation, with folding occurring at the cell surface. General features of the mechanism obtained here are likely to apply throughout the superfamily."
https://openalex.org/W2097958808,"The success of immunization with irradiated sporozoites is unparalleled among the current vaccination approaches against malaria, but its mechanistic underpinnings have yet to be fully elucidated. Using a model mimicking natural infection by Plasmodium yoelii, we delineated early events governing the development of protective CD8+ T-cell responses to the circumsporozoite protein. We demonstrate that dendritic cells in cutaneous lymph nodes prime the first cohort of CD8+ T cells after an infectious mosquito bite. Ablation of these lymphoid sites greatly impairs subsequent development of protective immunity. Activated CD8+ T cells then travel to systemic sites, including the liver, in a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)-dependent fashion. These effector cells, however, no longer require bone marrow–derived antigen-presenting cells for protection; instead, they recognize antigen on parenchymal cells—presumably parasitized hepatocytes. Therefore, we report an unexpected dichotomy in the tissue restriction of host responses during the development and execution of protective immunity to Plasmodium."
https://openalex.org/W2015454850,"Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) is of universal biological significance. It has emerged as an important global RNA, DNA and translation regulatory pathway. By systematically sequencing 737 genes (annotated in the Vertebrate Genome Annotation database) on the human X chromosome in 250 families with X-linked mental retardation, we identified mutations in the UPF3 regulator of nonsense transcripts homolog B (yeast) (UPF3B) leading to protein truncations in three families: two with the Lujan-Fryns phenotype and one with the FG phenotype. We also identified a missense mutation in another family with nonsyndromic mental retardation. Three mutations lead to the introduction of a premature termination codon and subsequent NMD of mutant UPF3B mRNA. Protein blot analysis using lymphoblastoid cell lines from affected individuals showed an absence of the UPF3B protein in two families. The UPF3B protein is an important component of the NMD surveillance machinery. Our results directly implicate abnormalities of NMD in human disease and suggest at least partial redundancy of NMD pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2047200125,"Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) is an important environmental cue for many organisms but is odorless to humans. It remains unclear whether the mammalian olfactory system can detect CO 2 at concentrations around the average atmospheric level (0.038%). We demonstrated the expression of carbonic anhydrase type II (CAII), an enzyme that catabolizes CO 2 , in a subset of mouse olfactory neurons that express guanylyl cyclase D (GC-D + neurons) and project axons to necklace glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Exposure to CO 2 activated these GC-D + neurons, and exposure of a mouse to CO 2 activated bulbar neurons associated with necklace glomeruli. Behavioral tests revealed CO 2 detection thresholds of ∼0.066%, and this sensitive CO 2 detection required CAII activity. We conclude that mice detect CO 2 at near-atmospheric concentrations through the olfactory subsystem of GC-D + neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2056982651,"A landmark paper in structural biology recently documented the crystal structure of LeuT, a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl−-dependent neurotransmitter transporters. In this homologue the transporter binds to two sodium ions and a substrate molecule. In the real neurotransmitter transporters of this family, chloride is co-transported with sodium and the neurotransmitter. Zomot et al. apply structural and mechanistic knowledge of LeuT, and a chloride transporter from an entirely different family, to mammalian neurotransmitter:sodium symporter (NSS) transporters, including GAT-1. They find that transported chloride ions serve to neutralize the positive charge carried by the sodium ions, and establish the probable location of the binding site for chloride, right next to one of the sodium ions. The mechanism of these transporters is of particular interest because of their role in the regulation of neurotransmission and as the site of action of drugs such as Prozac (fluoxetine). Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) use energy derived from sodium gradients to power transport of their respective neurotransmitters. But, whereas most eukaryotic NSS transporters are chloride-dependent, the prokaryotic homologue LeuT is not. Structural and mechanistic knowledge of LeuT, and a chloride transporter from an entirely different family, is applied to mammalian NSS transporters and finds that transported chloride ions serve to neutralise the positive charge carried by the sodium ions. Neurotransmitter:sodium symporters (NSS) have a critical role in regulating neurotransmission and are targets for psychostimulants, anti-depressants and other drugs1,2. Whereas the non-homologous glutamate transporters mediate chloride conductance3, in the eukaryotic NSS chloride is transported together with the neurotransmitter4,5,6,7. In contrast, transport by the bacterial NSS family members LeuT, Tyt1 and TnaT is chloride independent8,9,10. The crystal structure of LeuT reveals an occluded binding pocket containing leucine and two sodium ions9, and is highly relevant for the neurotransmitter transporters11,12,13. However, the precise role of chloride in neurotransmitter transport and the location of its binding site remain elusive. Here we show that introduction of a negatively charged amino acid at or near one of the two putative sodium-binding sites of the GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) transporter GAT-1 from rat brain (also called SLC6A1)14,15 renders both net flux and exchange of GABA largely chloride independent. In contrast to wild-type GAT-1, a marked stimulation of the rate of net flux, but not of exchange, was observed when the internal pH was lowered. Equivalent mutations introduced in the mouse GABA transporter GAT4 (SLC6A11) and the human dopamine transporter DAT (SLC6A3) also result in chloride-independent transport, whereas the reciprocal mutations in LeuT and Tyt1 render substrate binding and/or uptake by these bacterial NSS chloride dependent. Our data indicate that the negative charge, provided either by chloride or by the transporter itself, is required during binding and translocation of the neurotransmitter, probably to counterbalance the charge of the co-transported sodium ions."

https://openalex.org/W2018535796,"The enzyme uracil DNA glycosylase (UNG) excises unwanted uracil bases in the genome using an extrahelical base recognition mechanism. Efficient removal of uracil is essential for prevention of C-to-T transition mutations arising from cytosine deamination, cytotoxic U*A pairs arising from incorporation of dUTP in DNA, and for increasing immunoglobulin gene diversity during the acquired immune response. A central event in all of these UNG-mediated processes is the singling out of rare U*A or U*G base pairs in a background of approximately 10(9) T*A or C*G base pairs in the human genome. Here we establish for the human and Escherichia coli enzymes that discrimination of thymine and uracil is initiated by thermally induced opening of T*A and U*A base pairs and not by active participation of the enzyme. Thus, base-pair dynamics has a critical role in the genome-wide search for uracil, and may be involved in initial damage recognition by other DNA repair glycosylases."
https://openalex.org/W2100450635,"We have recently reported that in bone the cannabinoid CB1 receptor is present in sympathetic terminals. Here we show that traumatic brain injury (TBI), which in humans enhances peripheral osteogenesis and fracture healing, acutely stimulates bone formation in a distant skeletal site. At this site we demonstrate i) a high level of the main endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), and expression of diacylglycerol lipases, enzymes essential for 2-AG synthesis; ii) that the TBI-induced increase in bone formation is preceded by elevation of the 2-AG and a decrease in norepinephrine (NE) levels. The TBI stimulation of bone formation was absent in CB1-null mice. In wild-type animals it could be mimicked, including the suppression of NE levels, by 2-AG administration. The TBI- and 2-AG-induced stimulation of osteogenesis was restrained by the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol. NE from sympathetic terminals is known to tonically inhibit bone formation by activating osteoblastic beta2-adrenergic receptors. The present findings further demonstrate that the sympathetic control of bone formation is regulated through 2-AG activation of prejunctional CB1. Elevation of bone 2-AG apparently suppresses NE release from bone sympathetic terminals, thus alleviating the inhibition of bone formation. The involvement of osteoblastic CB2 signaling in this process is minimal, if any."

https://openalex.org/W2035993484,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is expressed and secreted in response to mitogens and integrin-dependent cell adhesion. Once released, autocrine MIF promotes the activation of RhoA GTPase leading to cell cycle progression in rodent fibroblasts. We now report that small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of MIF and MIF small molecule antagonism results in a greater than 90% loss of both the migratory and invasive potential of human lung adenocarcinoma cells. Correlating with these phenotypes is a substantial reduction in steady state as well as serum-induced effector binding activity of the Rho GTPase family member, Rac1, in MIF-deficient cells. Conversely, MIF overexpression by adenovirus in human lung adenocarcinoma cells induces a dramatic enhancement of cell migration, and co-expression of a dominant interfering mutant of Rac1 (Rac1N17) completely abrogates this effect. Finally, our results indicate that MIF depletion results in defective partitioning of Rac1 to caveolin-containing membrane microdomains, raising the possibility that MIF promotes Rac1 activity and subsequent tumor cell motility through lipid raft stabilization.

The acquisition of migratory and invasive properties by tumor cells is a central and often fatal step in neoplastic disease progression. Although normal, nontransformed cells have strict growth factor and adhesive requirements for motility, malignant cells have overcome these requirements through multiple mechanisms including gain of function oncogene mutations, growth factor receptor overexpression, and/or constitutive deregulation of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes (1Festuccia C.

Chem. 2005; 386: 193-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). A critical group of effectors downstream of mutated oncogenes or constitutively active growth factor receptors is the family of Rho GTPase enzymes (3Titus B. Schwartz M.A. Theodorescu D. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2005; 15: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Of the three main family members, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, Rac is arguably the most important in promoting and maintaining an invasive phenotype (3Titus B. Schwartz M.A. Theodorescu D. Crit. Rev. Eukaryot. Gene Expr. 2005; 15: 103-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 4Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D.

Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7821-7829Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). For example, in addition to promoting actin cytoskeletal reorganization, Rac is also necessary for nonsmall cell lung cancer matrix metalloprotease expression and subsequent invasive behavior (4Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Hsia D.A. Loftus J.C. Gaarde W.A. Monia B.P. Schlaepfer D.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 7079-7090PubMed Google Scholar). Among the described Rac effectors, p21-activated kinase (PAK) 2The abbreviations used are: PAK, p21-activated kinase; MIF, macrophage migration inhibitory factor; NSCLC, non-small cell lung cancers; siRNA, small interfering RNA; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; NS, nonspecific; RBD, rhotekin-binding domain; PBD, PAK-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NHBE, normal human bronchial epithelial. family members are considered to be responsible for many Rac-dependent cytoskeletal effects (6del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B.

In addition to the well described properties of GTP-loaded Rac and/or Cdc42 in PAK effector binding and activation, del Pozo et al. (9del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) recently described an additional requirement for Rac-mediated PAK activation. Integrin-dependent membrane translocation of GTP-loaded Rac was shown to be necessary for Rac-dependent PAK activation. Serum-induced PAK activation was shown to be defective in cells held in suspension, and this defect could not be rescued by the introduction of constitutively active mutants of RacV12 (9del Pozo M.A. Price L.S. Alderson N.B. Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2008-2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Importantly, the requirement for cell adhesion in Rac membrane localization and subsequent PAK activation was independent of GTP-loading of Rac consistent with the inability of serum or RacV12 mutants to activate PAK in suspension cells. Rather, suspension cells were found to contain higher levels of GTP-loaded Rac bound to Rho-GDI in the cytoplasm, thus conferring spatially constricted Rac effector activation (6del Pozo M.A. Kiosses W.B. Alderson N.B. Meller N. Hahn K.M. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 232-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies by the same group demonstrated that the requirement for cell adhesion in Rac-dependent PAK activation was due to the stabilization of caveolin-containing, cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains and that these “lipid rafts” are necessary for Rac-GTP-mediated PAK activation (10del Pozo M.A. Alderson N.B.

Grande-Garcia A. Anderson R.G. Schwartz M.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 901-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Many studies have reported that MIF expression is increased in premalignant, malignant, and metastatic tumors (12del Vecchio M.T. Tripodi S.A. Arcuri F. Pergola L. Hako L. Vatti R. Cintorino M. Prostate. 2000; 45: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 13Meyer-Siegler K.L. Bellino M.A. Tannenbaum M. Cancer. 2002; 94: 1449-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Breast-, prostate-, colon-, brain-, skin-, and lung-derived tumors have all been shown to contain significantly higher levels of MIF message and protein than their noncancerous cell counterparts (14Bando H.

Nakamura H. Ohkawara A. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Several reports also indicate that MIF expression closely correlates with tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential, possibly suggesting an important contribution to disease severity by MIF (12del Vecchio M.T. Tripodi S.A. Arcuri F. Pergola L. Hako L. Vatti R. Cintorino M. Prostate. 2000; 45: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Ren Y. Law S. Huang X. Lee P.Y. Bacher M. Srivastava G. Wong J.

MIF has been indirectly implicated in tumor growth and progression by stimulating tumor-dependent stromal processes such as neovascularization (16Shimizu T. Abe R. Nakamura H. Ohkawara A. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 19Chesney J. Metz C. Bacher M. Peng T. Meinhardt A. Bucala R. Mol.

Bucala R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7849-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). In fact, certain tumors possess an important functional requirement for MIF in maintaining optimal growth and progression (16Shimizu T. Abe R. Nakamura H. Ohkawara A. Suzuki M. Nishihira J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 751-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 23Meyer-Siegler K.L. Leifheit E.C. Vera P.L.

Med. 2002; 10: 579-583PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanistic processes induced by MIF to achieve these protumorigenic functions are still largely unresolved. We previously demonstrated that murine fibroblasts secrete MIF in response to growth factor stimulation of quiescent cells (25Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Both growth factor-induced and exogenously added MIF activate the ERK subfamily of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in a sustained fashion. MIF activation of ERK MAP kinase was subsequently shown to contribute to growth factor-stimulated cell cycle progression (25Mitchell R.A. Metz C.N. Peng T. Bucala R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18100-18106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). In addition to the discovery that MIF participates in growth factor signaling to MAP kinase, later studies revealed a critical role for MIF in the modulation of adhesion-dependent activation of MAP kinase, also in a sustained fashion (26Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies found that MIF is both necessary and sufficient for growth factor plus adhesion-induced sustained MAP kinase activation leading to cyclin D1 expression (26Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Swant J.D. Rendon B.E. Symons M. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23066-23072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). MIF-dependent cyclin D1 expression was found to be dependent upon the activity of RhoA GTPase-mediated stress fiber formation and subsequent focal adhesion kinase activation leading to the sustained stimulation of ERK MAP kinases (27Swant J.D. Rendon B.E. Symons M. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23066-23072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because Rho GTPase family members are central regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics leading to proliferative, migratory, and invasive properties, we sought to investigate whether MIF might functionally contribute to human lung adenocarcinoma growth and metastatic potential. Cell Culture—A549 cells were grown in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 50 μg/ml gentamycin. pLXSN-A549 and pLXSN-RacV12-A549 cells were grown in the same medium supplemented with 400 μg/ml Geneticin (Invitrogen). Primary normal human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE; Cambrex, Baltimore, MD), T antigen NHBE, and T antigen/RasV12 NHBE cells (generous gifts of Dr. Barrett Rollins, Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA) (28Soejima K. Fang W. Rollins B.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were cultured in bronchial epithelial growth medium with supplied supplements (Cambrex). For secreted MIF studies, semi-confluent cells were cultured in Opti-MEM serum-free medium for 48 h, concentrated in Microcon-10s (Amicon), and immunoblotted for MIF. RNA Interference—Two independent MIF siRNAs were used for silencing of MIF in these studies. The targeted base sequences for human MIF were: 5′-CCTTCTGGTGGGGAGAAAT-3′ (corresponding to the 3′-untranslated region of human MIF mRNA) and 5′-CAACTCCACCTTCGCCTAA-3′ (corresponding to the 3′ end of the open reading frame) (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO). As negative controls, both a commercially available siRNA and a scrambled siRNA based on the sequence of siRNA 1 above were used interchangeably (both referred to as nonspecific, NS). In all cases, the cells were transfected with 50 nm annealed siRNA oligonucleotides using Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 48 or 72 h and subjected to further analysis. For extracellular MIF reconstitution experiments, parallel control siRNA (NS) transfected cell supernatants were collected 36 h after transfection, mixed 1:1 with fresh medium, and placed on MIF siRNA transfected cells (transfected at the same time as control). For the nonreconstituted plates, parallel MIF siRNA transfected cell supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, mixed 1:1 with fresh medium, and placed on MIF siRNA transfected cells. Adenovirus Preparation and Cell Infection—Rac1N17 recombinant adenovirus was purchased from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA) and was used to infect cells at 5 × 107 virus particles/ml. Murine MIF cDNA was PCR-amplified using GGGTACCAATGCCTATGTTCATCGTG (forward) and GCTCGAGTCAAGCGAAGGTGGAACC (reverse) oligonucleotides. The PCR fragment was cloned in the pGEM(R)-T Easy vector (Promega), sequenced, and subcloned into the pAdTrack-CMV shuttle vector and was then co-transformed into Escherichia coli BJ5183 cells with a pAdEasy-1 adenoviral backbone plasmid. Recombinant virus was produced in 293A cells and purified by CsCl gradient. Viral titer was determined by multiplicity of infection testing of 293A cells and was used to infect cells at 5 × 107 virus particles/ml. Rho and Rac Effector Binding Assay—The rhotekin-binding domain (RBD) and PAK-binding domain (PBD)-GST plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Keith Burridge (University of North Carolina). The plasmids were transformed into BL-21 E. coli and GST-PBD (for Rac) and GST-RBD (for Rho) were purified as described (29Ren X.D. Schwartz M.A. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 264-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2 × 106 cells/sample were lysed in 10-cm dishes with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% DOC, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.5 mm MgCl2 followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. For GTPγS experiments, the cells were lysed in lysis buffer (above) supplemented with 20 mm EDTA (for all samples) and 100 μm GTPγS (for the + GTPγS samples) followed by incubation for 10 min at 30 °C (30Oka T. Ihara S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2011-2018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Lysates were incubated with 60 μl of a 50% slurry of GST-RBD beads or 30 μl of GST-PBD beads pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer. After rotating for 30 min at 4 °C the beads were collected by centrifugation, washed once in lysis buffer, and released by boiling in 1× Laem mli sample buffer. Rac1 and RhoA effector binding determination and total Rac1 and RhoA from lysates were assessed by Western blot analyses using RhoA (Santa Cruz), and Rac1 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies. Migration and Invasion Assays—For migration assays, modified Boyden chambers (Millicell-PCF, 8-μm pore size; Millipore, Bedford, MA) were placed in a 24-well plate and coated with 10 μg/ml rat tail collagen (Roche Applied Science) for 16 h at 37 °C. After removal of collagen and washing with PBS, migration medium (DMEM with 0.5% bovine serum albumin) was added to lower chamber in 0.4 ml. For the invasion assays, growth factor-reduced Matrigel matrix-coated transwell chambers (Becton Dickinson Lab Ware, Two Oak Park, Bedford, MA) were placed in a 24-well plate containing invasion medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum). Transfected or treated A549, pLXSN-A549, or pLXSN-RacV12-A549 cells were added to the upper compartment (2 × 105 in 0.3 ml of migration or invasion medium, respectively). The plates were incubated at 37 °C for 16 h for migration and 36 h for invasion. The cells were removed from the upper membrane surface with a cotton tip applicator and washed with PBS, and cells on the lower membrane surface were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. The cells were then stained (0.1% Crystal Violet in 20% ethanol and enumerated by counting four (200×) fields/chamber. Detergent Lysis and Sucrose Flotation Gradients—Treated cells were washed once with PBS and then lysed with a detergent lysis solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4,150 mm NaCl, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 1% Triton X-100. After incubation on ice for 30 min, the cells were scraped, and 350 μl of lysate was transferred to a 5-ml polyallomer tube (Beckman). The lysate was diluted with 350 μl of 2.4 m sucrose in 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl and overlaid with 1.23 ml of 0.9 m, 614 μl of 0.8 m, 1.23 ml of 0.7 m, and 1.23 ml of 0.2 m sucrose in 50 mm Tris and 150 mm NaCl. The samples were spun in an ultracentrifuge (Beckman) at 35,000 rpm at 4 °C for 17 h. After centrifugation, 650-μl fractions were collected from the top to the bottom. For Rac1 determination in light sucrose fractions, parallel samples were pooled and trichloroacetic acid-precipitated followed by 2× acetone washes before being solubilized in 0.5% SDS. Soft Agar Assay—For anchorage-independent growth, 5 × 104 transfected or treated cells were resuspended in 3 ml of medium containing 0.3% Noble agar (Difco) and plated on 6-cm dishes containing a solidified bottom layer made of 0.6% agar in complete medium. The cells were fed with 1 ml of 0.25% agar in DMEM every 3–4 days. After 20 days, the colonies were stained with 0.005% Crystal Violet for 1 h and counted under low power (40×) magnification. Cell Lysis and Fractionation—Treated cells were lysed with precooled lysis buffer (140 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton X-100) and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). After 30 min of incubation on ice, the cells were scraped and centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The post nuclear supernatant was further centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the Triton X-100-soluble and insoluble fractions. The insoluble pellet was washed twice with Tris-buffered saline buffer and resuspended in 2% SDS. Soluble and insoluble fractions were analyzed by Western blot. Infection of A549—pLXSN vector alone or pLXSN RacV12 (generous gifts of Dr. Pierre Roux, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Montpellier, France) were transfected into HEK 293 packaging cells using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Science) and viral supernatants were collected 72 h later. A549 cells were plated in 6-cm dishes at 1.5 × 105 cells/plate, and after 2 h, the medium was replaced with retroviral containing supernatant diluted 1:1 with fresh medium. After 48 h, medium was replaced with DMEM complete containing Geneticin (Invitrogen) at 400 μg/ml. Antibiotic-resistant cells were selected in this medium for 2 weeks and then pooled.

The data were analyzed by one-way or two-way analysis of variance using GraphPad Prism 4.1 statistical program. p values <0.05 were considered significant. MIF Is Overexpressed in Premalignant and Malignant Bronchial Epithelial Cells and Is Necessary for Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Migration—Prior studies reported an inherent requirement for MIF in oncogenic ras-mediated malignant transformation of rodent fibroblasts in defined settings (31Petrenko O.

Furthermore, MIF is overexpressed in human lung adenocarcinomas (33Tomiyasu M. Yoshino I. Suemitsu R. Okamoto T. Sugimachi K. Clin. Cancer Res. 2002; 8: 3755-3760PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kayser K.

Lung Cancer. 2003; 42: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and mutations of ras are estimated to occur in up to 50% of lung cancers (35Minamoto T. Mai M. Ronai Z. Cancer Detect. Prev. 2000; 24: 1-12PubMed Google Scholar). We determined whether there was a positive level of regulation of MIF expression and secretion by immortalizing and transforming oncogenes in lung bronchioalveolar epithelial cells. Three independent cell types representing three stages of malignant transformation of human lung epithelial cells were evaluated (28Soejima K. Fang W. Rollins B.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Levels of secreted MIF from normal (primary), immortalized (SV40 large T-antigen), and transformed (T-Ag/rasV12) human bronchial epithelial cells (28Soejima K. Fang W. Rollins B.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 4723-4733Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) were determined by culturing equal numbers of each cell type for 48 h, normalizing supernatant to cell number, and then assessing by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1A, two independent experiments demonstrate that both human lung epithelial cell immortalization and human lung epithelial cell immortalization/transformation results in a significant increase in secreted MIF, suggesting that immortalizing and transforming oncoproteins induce the expression and/or secretion of MIF (by densitometry, average increase MIF secretion over NHBE was: T-Ag = 2.02-fold, T-Ag/rasV12 = 2.58-fold). These results, coupled with the high expression of MIF previously observed in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and tumors (20White E.S. Strom S.R. Wys N.L. Arenberg D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7549-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Tomiyasu M. Yoshino I. Suemitsu R. Okamoto T. Sugimachi K. Clin.

Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 853-860PubMed Google Scholar), suggest that bronchial epithelial cell MIF expression may reflect the relative transformation state of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLC). We recently described a central role for MIF in the regulation of steady state RhoA activity in mesenchymal cell signaling to cyclin D1 expression. Additionally, Sun et al. (37Sun B. Nishihira J. Yoshiki T. Kondo M. Sato Y. Sasaki F. Todo S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1050-1058PubMed Google Scholar) showed that MIF contributes to mitogen-induced migration and cell invasion in a RhoA-dependent manner. To determine whether human NSCLC cells were similarly dependent upon MIF for motility, we inhibited the expression of MIF by siRNA oligonucleotides in the human nonsmall cell lung adenocarcinoma cell line, A549. As shown in Fig. 1B, transfection of siRNA oligonucleotides directed against human MIF consistently resulted in the loss of MIF expression when compared with scrambled siRNA oligonucleotides (NS) or mock transfection in the A549 cell line. Importantly and consistent with prior observations (37Sun B. Nishihira J. Yoshiki T. Kondo M. Sato Y. Sasaki F. Todo S. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1050-1058PubMed Google Scholar), siRNA-mediated MIF depletion resulted in a profound inhibition of human lung cancer cell migration on collagencoated transwell chambers (Fig. 1C, top panel). Reconstitution of MIF by MIF-containing conditioned supernatants restored, by greater than 70%, the ability of the MIF-depleted cells to migrate (Fig. 1C, bottom panel). Silencing or Inhibition of MIF Results in a Loss of Cell Adhesion and Invasive Potential in Human Lung Adenocarcinoma— Because integrin-dependent binding to extracellular matrices is necessary for actin reorganization and subsequent motility, we next evaluated whether siRNA-mediated depletion of MIF influenced NSCLC cell adhesion and spreading on collagen. As shown in Fig. 2A, depletion of MIF by siRNA greatly reduced the adhesive ability of NSCLC cells. This loss of adhesion associated with MIF deficiency was likely due to the observed inability of these cells to adequately and appropriately spread when plated onto their normal extracellular matrix substrate (Fig. 2A, top panels). Importantly, when MIF-depleted cells were cultured in MIF-containing conditioned medium, the cells spread and adhered much more efficiently, suggesting that this defect is specifically due to loss of extracellular MIF (Fig. 2A). The observed loss of adhesive and migratory properties in MIF-depleted cells would predict that these cells would be similarly defective in invasive potential. As such, we next investigated whether MIF was necessary for NSCLC cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 2B, cells (NS siRNA versus MIF siRNA) lacking MIF were consistently more than 80% defective in migrating through a basement membrane (Matrigel). In parallel, we also tested whether treatment of A549 cells with a well characterized small molecule inhibitor of MIF, ISO-1 (38Lubetsky J.B. Dios A. Han J. Aljabari B. Ruzsicska B. Mitchell R.

Neuroimmunol. 2005; 168: 168-174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), reduced the invasive capacity of these cells. As shown in Fig. 2B, inhibition of MIF by small molecule antagonism results in a loss of invasive potential that is nearly identical to that observed with MIF depletion with siRNA. As such, using two independent means of MIF inhibition, our results strongly indicate that there is an inherent requirement for MIF for NSCLC motility and metastatic potential. Moreover, these findings are consistent with the notion that endogenous, cellular MIF is an important participant in adhesion-dependent processes (26Liao H. Bucala R. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 76-81Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 27Swant J.D. Rendon B.E. Symons M. Mitchell R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 23066-23072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Silencing or Inhibition of MIF in NSCLC Cells Results in Loss of Anchorage-independent Growth—Because MIF participates in adhesion-dependent signaling processes, we hypothesized that the increased MIF expression observed in NSCLC cell lines and tumors (20White E.S. Strom S.R. Wys N.L. Arenberg D.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7549-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Tomiyasu M. Yoshino I. Suemitsu R. Okamoto T. Sugimachi K. Clin.

Cancer Res. 2003; 9: 853-860PubMed Google Scholar) may be permissive to adhesion-independent signaling processes. To test this, we evaluated whether the targeted depletion of MIF in lung adenocarcinoma cells conferred resistance to anchorage-independent growth. Mock transfected, nonsense siRNA (NS siRNA) transfected and MIF siRNA transfected cells were placed into soft agar to determine whether cells lacking MIF could divide and form colonies. As shown in Fig. 3A, cells lacking MIF were refractory to soft agar colony growth. Of perhaps greater importance, soft agar co-incubation of lung adenocarcinoma cells with the ISO-1 MIF inhibitor reduced anchorage-independent growth by roughly 50% (Fig. 3B). Although these studies support the conclusion that MIF is an important e"
https://openalex.org/W2096093342,"Sumoylation has emerged as an indispensable post-translational modification that modulates the functions of a broad spectrum of proteins. Recent studies have demonstrated that reactive oxygen species influence the equilibrium of sumoylation-desumoylation. We show herein that H2O2 induces formation of an intermolecular disulfide linkage of human SUMO protease SENP1 via the active-site Cys 603 and a unique residue Cys 613. Such reversible modification confers a higher recovery of enzyme activity, which is also observed in yeast Ulp1, but not in human SENP2, suggesting its protective role against irreversible sulfhydryl oxidation. In vivo formation of a disulfide-linked dimer of SENP1 is also detected in cultured cells in response to oxidative stress. The modifications are further elucidated by the crystal structures of Ulp1 with the catalytic cysteine oxidized to sulfenic, sulfinic, and sulfonic acids. Our findings suggest that, in addition to SUMO conjugating enzymes, SUMO proteases may act as redox sensors and effectors modulating the desumoylation pathway and specific cellular responses to oxidative stress."

The carbohydrate chains that form the backbone of peptidoglycan are made by peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs), highly conserved membrane-bound enzymes that are thought to be excellent targets for the development of new antibacterials. Although structural information on these enzymes recently became available, their mechanism is not well understood because of a dearth of methods to monitor PGT activity. Here we describe a direct, sensitive, and quantitative SDS-PAGE method to analyze PGT reactions. We apply this method to characterize the substrate specificity and product length profile for two different PGT domains, PBP1A from Aquifex aeolicus and PBP1A from Escherichia coli. We show that both disaccharide and tetrasaccharide diphospholipids (Lipid II and Lipid IV) serve as substrates for these PGTs, but the product distributions differ significantly depending on which substrate is used as the starting material. Reactions using the disaccharide substrate are more processive and yield much longer glycan products than reactions using the tetrasaccharide substrate. We also show that the SDS-PAGE method can be applied to provide information on the roles of invariant residues in catalysis. A comprehensive mutational analysis shows that the biggest contributor to turnover of 14 mutated residues is an invariant glutamate located in the center of the active site cleft.

The assay and results described provide new information about the process by which PGTs assemble bacterial cell walls. The characteristic shape of a bacterial cell is a function of the three-dimensional architecture of the cell wall (1Höltje J.V. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 181-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The major rigid component of the cell wall is peptidoglycan, a mesh-like polymer comprising linear glycan chains held together by peptide cross-links (2van Heijenoort J. Glycobiology. 2001; 11: 25R-36RCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycan chains are assembled from a diphospholipid-linked disaccharide-peptide precursor, Lipid II, by peptidoglycan glycosyltransferases (PGTs) 3The abbreviations used are: PGT, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase; TP, transpeptidase; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; TEMED, N, N, N', N'-tetramethylethylenediamine; PG, peptidoglycan; NAG, N-acetylglucosaminyl; NAM, N-acetylmuramyl.3The abbreviations used are: PGT, peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase; TP, transpeptidase; PBP, penicillin-binding protein; TEMED, N, N, N', N'-tetramethylethylenediamine; PG, peptidoglycan; NAG, N-acetylglucosaminyl; NAM, N-acetylmuramyl. (Fig. 1). These glycan chains are then cross-linked via the attached peptides by transpeptidases (TPs) (3Macheboeuf P. Kim C. Job V. Dideberg O. Dessen A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2006; 30: 673-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 4van Heijenoort J. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2001; 18: 503-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar).The transpeptidases are targets for several families of clinically important antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins, and imipenems (5Fisher J.F.

Rev. 2005; 105: 425-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), and the PGTs are thought to be promising antibacterial targets as well. There is a potent family of natural products, represented by the phosphoglycolipid moenomycin, which inhibit the PGTs with lethal cellular effects (7Ostash B. Kim A. Walker S. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 8Ostash B. Kim S. Curr. Opin. Chem.

However, there are still no drugs in clinical use that operate by binding directly to the PGTs. A better under-standing of the PGTs and how they can be inhibited is required to exploit them as antibiotic targets and may also shed light on their cellular functions.PGTs are membrane-anchored polymerases that exist naturally in two forms, as N-terminal domains in bifunctional penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), called class A high molecular weight PBPs, which contain C-terminal TP domains, and as monofunctional enzymes that do not contain transpeptidase domains (Fig. 1A) (2van Heijenoort J.

Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1079-1093Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Notable progress toward understanding PGTs has been made recently. For example, structures of two PGTs, one with moenomycin bound in the active site cleft, are now available and provide a starting point for inhibitor design (11Lovering A.L. Kim L.H. Lim D. Strynadka N.C. Science. 2007; 315: 1402-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 15Yuan Y. Kim D. Zhang Y. Kahne D. Sliz P. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 5348-5353Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). However, we still lack answers to fundamental questions about the reactions catalyzed by PGTs, which limits our ability to think about their roles in bacterial cell growth and division. Questions that remain unanswered include the following. How long are the glycan chains made by particular PGTs? Do different PGTs within the same organism show significant differences in glycan product distributions? Are the glycan chain length distributions compatible with current models for the three-dimensional structure of the bacterial cell wall? Do other cellular factors affect chain length distributions? One of our goals is to develop facile in vitro methods to analyze PGT reactions so that these and other fundamental questions about their behavior can be addressed.PGTs catalyze the conversion of the peptidoglycan precursor, Lipid II, into glycan chains. The process involves the coupling of Lipid II units to form a tetrasaccharide, Lipid IV (Fig. 1, n = 1), followed by successive addition of Lipid II units to the reducing end of the growing polymer (16Perlstein D.L. Kim Y. Wang T.-S. Kahne D. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the PGT reaction requires having both Lipid II and Lipid IV substrates, combined with an assay that reports on glycan chain lengths. We and others have developed methods to obtain useful quantities of Lipid II and Lipid IV substrates (17Breukink E. Kim H.E. Vollmerhaus P.J. Swiezewska E. Brunner L. Walker S.

In this paper, we describe a facile assay to analyze PGT reactions that provides information on reaction rates as well as glycan chain lengths. This assay has enabled us to compare two PGT domains from different organisms, PBP1A from Aquifex aeolicus and PBP1A from Escherichia coli, with respect to their ability to utilize disaccharide and tetrasaccharide substrates. For the A. aeolicus PGT domain, for which we recently reported the structure (15Yuan Y. Kim D. Zhang Y. Kahne D. Sliz P. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gels were prepared using the Protean xii system (Bio-Rad). Separating gels, 200 × 200 × 1 mm, were prepared (stacking gel omitted) in a final concentration of 9% T, 2.6% C in 1× gel buffer, where T is the total percentage concentration of both acrylamide and bisacrylamide, and C represents the percentage of bisacrylamide (cross-linker) relative to T. Gel solutions were filtered and degassed before the addition of TEMED.Samples were prepared by vacuum centrifuging the reaction mixtures to 1 μl or dryness and reconstituting them in 2 μlof sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 25% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10% saturated solution of bromphenol blue). Samples were then loaded under the cathode buffer as thin bands with filling height less than 3 mm. Electrophoresis was performed on a Protean II xi vertical gel apparatus set at 30 mA constant current with a maximum voltage of 200 V. Gels were run for ∼4 h, or until the bromphenol blue dye front was 0.5 cm from the end of the gel. Gels were dried overnight without fixing and imaged by autoradiography using a tritium storage phosphor screen and scanner (Typhoon 9400, GE Healthcare). Densitometric band quantitations were carried out with the ImageQuant TL software package (GE Healthcare) using the included one-dimensional gel analysis program. The regularity in the distribution of the ladder of oligomers was also verified by SDS-PAGE separation of a Lipid II and Lipid IV reaction mixture in parallel (Fig. 3).FIGURE 3SDS-PAGE separation of NAG-NAM oligomers. Lane 1, oligomers generated from reaction of Lipid IV (2b, 110 μCi/μmol) under standard assay conditions (as described under “Experimental procedures”) and quenched at 45 min. Lane 2, oligomers generated from reaction of 10 μm acetylated Lipid II (1c, 72 μCi/μmol) and A. aeolicus PBP1A PGT domain (3.3 μm) quenched at 3 min. The use of high enzyme: substrate ratios biases the product distribution to shorter oligomers, ≤ (NAG-NAM)20, but oligomers up to (NAG-NAM)30 can be resolved under these conditions (see supplemental Fig. S1).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Reaction Time Courses with Isolated PGT Domains—All reactions using enzymes from the hyperthermophile, A. aeolicus were prepared on ice and initiated with a rapid temperature ramp to 55 °C in a PCR cycler (Eppendorf Mastercycler). Reactions with enzyme from E. coli were performed at room temperature. All reactions were quenched with excess (200 μm) moenomycin A and kept on ice before gel analysis.When [14C]Lipid II (1b) was used as a substrate, reactions (5 μl) were carried out in buffer A (20% Me2SO, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2) containing 8 μm 1b and 0.08 μm PGT. Reactions were quenched at 2.5, 5, 10, 12, 15, and 25 min for the A. aeolicus PGT domain and 7, 10, 12, 15, and 25 min for the E. coli PGT domain.When [14C]Lipid IV (2b) was used as a substrate with E. coli PGT domain, conditions were as follows: reactions (5 μl) contained buffer A with 8 μm 2b and 0.8 μm PGT and were quenched at 2, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 min. For A. aeolicus, PGT domain reactions (12 μl) contained buffer A with 5 μm 2b and 1.7 μm PGT and were quenched at 1, 2, 5, 10, 15, and 30 min.Elongation of Oligomers with Lipid II—Oligomers were prepared by incubating 0.8 μm full-length E. coli PBP1A with 8 μm [14C]2b in buffer B (buffer A supplemented with 1 kilounits/ml penicillin G) for 2 h. Boiling for 10 min terminated the reaction and precipitated protein was pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 20 min. The supernatant containing the oligomeric mix was separated into 4.5-μl aliquots. One aliquot of untreated starting material was saved as a control. Reactions (10 μl each) in buffer B contained 4.5 μl of oligomeric starting material and 0.8 μm of either full-length E. coli PBP1A or A. aeolicus PGT domain in the presence or absence of 4 μm Lipid II (1a) incubated for 10 min. A second control sample was prepared by incubating full-length E. coli PBP1A and 8 μm ([14C]GlcNAc)-Lipid II (1b) in buffer B for 5 min.Mutant Activity Assays—Reactions (5 μl) were prepared in buffer A using 4 μm radiolabeled Lipid II (1b), 0.06 μm enzyme, and time points taken at 30 and 60 min. Product analysis was performed using a paper chromatography assay as described (15Yuan Y. Kim D. Zhang Y. Kahne D. Sliz P. Walker S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

E83Q had time points taken at 30, 60, and 600 min. Product analysis was then performed using the SDS-PAGE assay described here.RESULTSEstablishing a Gel Electrophoresis Assay for the Separation of Glycan Chains—Most assays to monitor PGT activity rely on detecting the presence of polymeric products (18Schwartz B.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), but cannot distinguish different glycan chain lengths, which greatly limits the information they provide about the reaction. Because the glycan products of a PGT reaction are composed of repeating disaccharide units that have a net negative charge, we investigated gel electrophoresis methods to analyze glycan chain length distributions. Radiolabeled Lipid II (Fig. 2, 1b and 1c) and Lipid IV (Fig. 2, 2b) substrates were prepared as described (20Ye X.Y. Kim M.C. Brunner L. Walker D. Kahne D. Walker S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 3155-3156Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 21Zhang Y. Kim E.J. Wang T.S. Barrett D. Walker S. Kahne D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 3080-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and radiolabels were either incorporated enzymatically or via acetylation. Previous work has established that substrates with substituents at the third position of the pentapeptide chain, such as acetyl groups on the lysine amine (e.g. 1c and 2b) have comparable kinetic parameters to unmodified substrates (e.g. 1b) (21Zhang Y. Kim E.J. Wang T.S. Barrett D. Walker S. Kahne D.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 3080-3081Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 30Schwartz B. Kim J.A. Seitz S.P. Wang Y. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). At high substrate:enzyme (∼1:3) ratios, the A. aeolicus PBP1A PGT domain converts the substrates into mixtures of products representing a range of glycan chain lengths. Optimal gel conditions for separating PGT products utilize a modified tricine-SDS-PAGE system (24Lesse A.J. Kim A.A. Bittner W.E. Apicella M.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 25Schägger H. Kim G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar). The bromphenol blue dye migrates ahead of Lipid II under the standard running conditions, allowing the progress of the runs to be visually tracked. A 9% gel was optimal for separating uncross-linked glycan strands containing from one to thirty repeat units as determined from the size standards generated using the substrates (Fig. 3; see also supplemental data, Fig. S1). The separation of glycan chains is indifferent to the presence of proteins, salts at the concentrations used in typical reaction buffers, and other additives. Moreover, because only labeled glycan chains are detected, sample cleanup is unnecessary. The use of radiolabeled substrates in the reaction obviates the need for post-reaction labeling to detect products. Finally, it should be possible to adapt this assay to detect products of reactions carried out with substrates labeled in other ways, e.g. with fluorophores or biotin moieties on the peptide side chains.Product Distributions with Lipid II as the Substrate—With an assay in place to separate glycan chains, we examined the product distributions for the PGT domains of A. aeolicus PBP1A (Fig. 4A) and E. coli PBP1A (Fig. 4B) using the radiolabeled Lipid II substrate 1b and an enzyme:substrate ratio of 1:100. There is a delay in the formation of products, which is particularly pronounced for the PGT domain of E. coli PBP1A. This lag phase has also been observed for E. coli PBP1B using other assays (26Chen L. Kim D. Sun B. Hu Y. Walker S. Kahne D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5658-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 30Schwartz B. Kim J.A. Seitz S.P. Wang Y. Stein R.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12552-12561Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and has been attributed either to a slow initial coupling step to form a “primer” or to a slow rearrangement to the active conformation. Following the lag phase, relatively long glycan chains appear without significant accumulation of short products, consistent with a processive mechanism in which coupling of Lipid II subunits can occur without release of the elongating product. The distribution of glycan chains is narrower for the E. coli PBP1A PGT domain than for the A. aeolicus PGT domain. Furthermore, shorter products are less evident early in the reaction for the E. coli enzyme than for the A. aeolicus PGT domain. These results suggest that the E. coli PGT domain is more processive than the A. aeolicus PGT domain. The SDS-PAGE method described here should make it possible to establish whether differences in processivity, and thus glycan chain length distribution, exist among different PGTs encoded in the genome of the same organism.FIGURE 4SDS-PAGE analysis of Lipid II (1b, 288 μCi/μmol) reactions catalyzed by the PGT domains of (A) A. aeolicus PBP1A and (B) E. coli PBP1A.

This result was surprising because it was previously thought that only the disaccharide substrate (Lipid II) was capable of reacting with the growing glycan polymer. Because the paper chromatography assay used previously did not provide information about glycan chain length, we have used the newly developed SDS-PAGE assay to examine the product lengths for the A. aeolicus PBP1A (Fig. 5A) and E. coli PBP1A (Fig. 5B) PGT domains with the tetrasaccharide substrate 2b. For both enzymes, this substrate reacts more slowly than Lipid II (Table 1) even at high enzyme concentrations. In the case of the tetrasaccharide substrate, short products accumulated before longer products appeared, a pattern consistent with a distributive mechanism in which products are released after each coupling cycle. In contrast, even at 1:10 (enzyme:substrate) ratios, Lipid II reacts to form mainly long polymers (see Fig. 6C).FIGURE 5SDS-PAGE product distribution of Lipid IV oligomers.

https://openalex.org/W1966825008,"KAP1 is a nuclear corepressor with conserved domains for RING finger, B boxes, leucine zipper α helical coiled-coil region, plant homeo domain finger, and bromo domain. The plant homeo domain finger and bromo domain of KAP1 cooperatively function as a transcription repression domain by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex NuRD and histone H3 lysine 9-specific methyltransferase SETDB1. Here we report that KAP1 binds the E2F1 transcription factor in a retinoblastoma protein (pRb)-independent fashion and inhibits E2F1 activity. KAP1 stimulates formation of E2F1-HDAC1 complex and inhibits E2F1 acetylation. Ectopic expression of KAP1 represses E2F1 transcription and apoptosis functions independent of pRb. Depletion of endogenous KAP1 in pRb-deficient Saos2 cells by RNA interference increases E2F1 acetylation level, stimulates E2F1 transcriptional activity, and sensitizes apoptosis response to DNA damage. Therefore, KAP1 contributes to the negative regulation of E2F1 and may serve as a partial backup to prevent E2F1-mediated apoptosis in the absence of pRb.

Therefore, KAP1 contributes to the negative regulation of E2F1 and may serve as a partial backup to prevent E2F1-mediated apoptosis in the absence of pRb. Members of the E2F family, particularly E2F1, play important roles in regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis. E2F1 stimulates the transcription of several genes in the apoptosis pathway (1Nahle Z. Polakoff J. Davuluri R.V. McCurrach M.E. Jacobson M.D. Narita M. Zhang M.Q. Lazebnik Y. Bar-Sagi D. Lowe S.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 859-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E2F1 induces premature S phase entry and often results in apoptosis (2Johnson D.G. Schwarz J.K. Cress W.D. Nevins J.R. Nature. 1993; 365: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar, 3Wu X. Levine A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3602-3606Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). E2F1 is stabilized and activated by DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner, resulting in the activation of a subset of E2F1 targets (4Lin W.C. Lin F.T. Nevins J.R. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1833-1844PubMed Google Scholar, 5Stevens C. Smith L. La Thangue N.B. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). E2F1 also undergoes acetylation on several lysine residues adjacent to the DNA binding domain, which stimulates its DNA binding (6Martinez-Balbas M.A. Bauer U.M. Nielsen S.J. Brehm A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 662-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). The acetylation level of E2F1 is stimulated by DNA damage, which may regulate its ability to induce pro-apoptotic targets (7Pediconi N. Ianari A. Costanzo A. Belloni L. Gallo R. Cimino L. Porcellini A. Screpanti I. Balsano C. Alesse E. Gulino A. Levrero M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 552-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). DNA damage-induced apoptosis in p53-deficient cells often require E2F1 activity (8Ma Y. Cress W.D. Haura E.B. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2003; 2: 73-81PubMed Google Scholar, 9Pruschy M. Wirbelauer C.

Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 585-593PubMed Google Scholar). pRb forms a complex with E2F1 and recruits histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and SUV39H1 to E2F1 target promoters, causing changes in chromatin modification levels and transcriptional silencing (11Dimova D.K. Dyson N.J. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2810-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Mutation of pRb or hyperphosphorylation by activated cyclin D/E-cyclin-dependent kinase 4 complex in cancer cells presumably leads to deregulation of E2F1 activity, contributing to loss of cell cycle control and increased tendency to undergo apoptosis. However, it is clear that E2F1 activity is controlled by multiple factors in addition to pRb. The TopBP1 protein has been shown to bind E2F1 independent of pRb and recruits Brg1, a central component of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to repress E2F1 target promoters (12Liu K. Lin F.T. Ruppert J.M. Lin W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 3287-3304Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 13Liu K. Luo Y. Lin F.T. Lin W.C. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The Class III histone deacetylase SirT1 also interacts with E2F1 and inhibits E2F1 transcriptional and apoptosis function after DNA damage (14Wang C. Chen L. Hou X. Li Z. Kabra N. Ma Y. Nemoto S. Finkel T. Gu W. Cress W.D. Chen J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 1025-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Therefore, the apoptosis activity of E2F1 is likely to be controlled by multiple factors besides pRb to prevent cell death in the absence of pRb. These factors may provide redundancy, promoter specificity, and signal-specific regulation of E2F1. In this report, we describe the identification of nuclear corepressor KAP1 as a novel E2F1-binding protein. KAP1 (also named TIF1β) was first identified as a factor important for the transcription repression function of Kruppel-associated box domain (15Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). KAP1 contains conserved domains for RING finger, B boxes, leucine zipper α helical coiled-coil region, plant homeo domain finger, and bromo domain. The N-terminal RING, B boxes, and coiled-coil sequences (RBCC) are necessary and sufficient for interaction with Kruppel-associated box and formation of KAP1 oligomers (16Peng H. Begg G.E. Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Rauscher III, F.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 1139-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The RBCC tripartite motif (also called TRIM) is found in a large family of proteins including PML, TIF1, and Rfp (17Jensen K. Shiels C. Freemont P.S. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 7223-7233Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). The C-terminal plant homeo domain finger and bromo domain of KAP1 cooperatively function as a transcription repression domain by recruiting the histone deacetylase complex NuRD and histone H3 lysine 9-specific methyltransferase SETDB1 (18Schultz D.C. Friedman J.R. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 428-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 19Schultz D.C. Ayyanathan K. Negorev D. Maul G.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 919-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Therefore, KAP1 may function as a corepressor in part by being targeted to DNA by other transcription factors and promotes modification of chromatin structure. KAP1 expression is important for normal development in mice. Germ line homozygous knock out of KAP1 results in embryonic lethality at E5.5 (20Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development. 2000; 127: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological targets and functions of KAP1 are still poorly understood. Its interactions with chromatin modification factors such as HDAC1, SETDB1, and HP1 are consistent with interesting activities in the regulation of chromatin structure and heterochromatin formation, resulting in both transient and stable epigenetic silencing of reporter genes in artificial systems (21Sripathy S.P. Stevens J. Schultz D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 8623-8638Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 22Ayyanathan K. Lechner M.S. Bell P. Maul G.G. Schultz D.C. Yamada Y. Tanaka K. Torigoe K. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1855-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggested that KAP1 is regulated by DNA damage and is phosphorylated by ATM on Ser-824 (23Ziv Y. Bielopolski D. Galanty Y. Lukas C. Taya Y. Schultz D.C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Shiloh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 24White D.E. Negorev D. Peng H. Ivanov A.V. Maul G.G. Rauscher III, F.J. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 11594-11599Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), which then mediates global chromatin decondensation after formation of DNA double-stranded breaks. KAP1 expression and phosphorylation of Ser-824 is important for cell survival after DNA damage through unknown mechanisms. Recently, KAP1 has also been shown to interact with the p53 regulator MDM2 and inhibit p53 activity (25Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher III, F.J. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Okamoto K. Kitabayashi I. Taya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). KAP1 depletion by RNA interference increases p53 activity after DNA damage, which may also contribute to increased apoptosis. Results described below show that E2F1 and KAP1 interact through the coiled-coil domain of KAP1 and the central domain of E2F1. KAP1 stimulates formation of E2F1-HDAC1 complex and inhibits E2F1 acetylation. Overexpression of KAP1 inhibits E2F1 transcriptional and apoptosis activity. Reduction of endogenous KAP1 level increases E2F1 acetylation level and sensitizes cells to E2F1 activation and apoptosis after DNA damage. Therefore, KAP1 is a novel E2F1-binding protein that contributes to E2F1 functional regulation. Cell Lines, Plasmids, and Reagents—H1299, Saos2, HT1080, and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. KAP1 constructs were described previously (15Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J. Jensen D.E. Speicher D.W. Huang X.P. Neilson E.G. Rauscher III, F.J.

The following oligos (only 23-mer sense strand is shown) were used: K2 (5′-CCAGCCAACCAGCGGAAATGTGA, specific against KAP1) and GT (5′-CCTCTTTCTTATCCTCGTATGT, a control against alternatively spliced isoform of SETDB1). Purified adenovirus expressing p53 was prepared as described previously (28Lu W. Lin J. Chen J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1305-1310PubMed Google Scholar). Acetylated E2F1-specific rabbit antibodies were raised against acetylated E2F1 peptides HPG(Ac-K117)GVKSPG and PGE(Ac-K125)SRYETS (GenScript) and affinity-purified using columns conjugated with the acetylated and non-acetylated peptides. Both Ac-K117 and Ac-K125 antibodies produced similar results, with the Ac-K117 antibody being more sensitive. Western Blot—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g; the insoluble debris were discarded. Cell lysate (10–50 μg of protein) was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P filters (Millipore). The filter was blocked for 1 h with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk, 0.1% Tween 20. E2F1 was detected using monoclonal antibody KH95 or rabbit polyclonal antibody C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Antibodies for pRb, p27, cyclin D3, Apaf-1, and dihydrofolate reductase were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. KAP1 was detected with rabbit anti-KAP1 antibody (Bethyl). The filter was developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and ECL-plus reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation-Western Blot Assay—Cells were lysed in lysis buffer and centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g, and the insoluble debris were discarded. Cell lysate (200–500 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated using 0.5–1 μg of mouse monoclonal antibody against E2F1, KAP1, or epitope tags and protein A-agarose beads for 4 h at 4°C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer, boiled in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by anti-KAP1 or E2F1 Western blot using rabbit polyclonal antibodies to reduce background from Ig heavy chain. Luciferase Reporter Assay—Cells (50,000/well) were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with a mixture containing 20 ng of E2F1-responsive luciferase reporter plasmids, 5 ng of CMV-lacZ plasmid, 20 ng of E2F1 expression plasmid, and 50 ng of KAP1 plasmid. Transfection was achieved using Lipofectamine PLUS reagents (Invitrogen), and cells were analyzed for luciferase and β galactosidase expression after 24 h. The ratio of luciferase/β galactosidase activity was used as indicator of E2F1 transcriptional activity. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using the published procedure. H1299 cells were transiently transfected with E2F1 and KAP1 expression plasmids. E2F1 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed using KH95 antibody; KAP1 ChIP was performed using a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Bethyl). Coprecipitated chromatin was analyzed by PCR (28–32 cycles) for the presence of E2F1 promoter using primers 5′-AGGAACCGCCGCCGTTGTTCCCGT and 5′-CTGCCTGCAAAGTCCCGGCCACTT. KAP1 Forms a Complex with E2F1 and Regulates E2F1 Activity—E2F1 is regulated by interaction with the retinoblastoma protein pRb, which recruits histone deacetylase and methylase to suppress E2F1 target promoters. The KAP1 corepressor has been shown to repress Kruppel-associated box family transcription factors and recently found to inhibit p53 activity through interaction with MDM2. However, relatively few physiological targets or partners of KAP1 have been identified to date. Recent studies implicated KAP1 playing a role in the inhibition of apoptosis after DNA damage, and KAP1 is itself a target of DNA damage-induced phosphorylation. In addition to p53, E2F1 is an important regulator of apoptosis in transformed or DNA-damaged cells. Therefore, we tested whether E2F1 interacts with KAP1. When 293T cells were immunoprecipitated using E2F1 antibody KH95, coprecipitation of endogenous KAP1 was detected by Western blot (Fig. 1a). Transfection of additional KAP1 strongly increased the level of coprecipitation with endogenous E2F1 (Fig. 1a). Because 293T cells express high levels of p53 and SV40 T antigen that may cause formation of new complexes, the experiment was repeated using H1299 cells devoid of p53 and viral proteins. The results also confirmed the coprecipitation of endogenous E2F1 and KAP1 in this cell line (Fig. 1b). To test whether KAP1 can regulate E2F1 activity, H1299 cells were transfected with E2F1 expression vector and several E2F1-responsive promoters (SirT1, Cyclin D3, p27, E2F1) (14Wang C. Chen L. Hou X.

Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1514-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Overexpression of KAP1 significantly inhibited E2F1 transcription activation function in such assays (Fig. 1c). In 293T cells which can be transfected at near 100% efficiency, cotransfection of KAP1 and pRb showed cooperative effect in the inhibition of endogenous E2F1 target expression (Fig. 1d). To further test whether endogenous KAP1 has a role in regulating E2F1, the E2F1 reporter constructs were cotransfected with E2F1 into U2OS cell lines with stable knock down of endogenous KAP1. E2F1 activation of the reporters was also higher (up to 2-fold) in cells with reduced KAP1 level (Fig. 1e), suggesting that endogenous level of KAP1 contributes to inhibition of E2F1 activity. E2F1 recruits pRb to target gene promoters and directly represses transcription from the promoter. Because KAP1 can also repress transcription after being targeted to promoters, its recruitment by E2F1 to DNA was tested by ChIP assay. In untransfected H1299 cells, low levels of E2F1 and KAP1 binding to the E2F1 promoter were detected, possibly from endogenous proteins. Transfection of E2F1 alone resulted in increased KAP1 binding to the promoter, suggesting that high level E2F1 expression recruited the endogenous KAP1 to DNA (Fig. 1f). Transfection of KAP1 alone also increased KAP1 ChIP signal, presumably mediated by endogenous E2F1 or other DNA binding factors. Moderate increase of KAP1 DNA binding was observed after E2F1 and KAP1 cotransfection. E2F1 ChIP signal was significantly increased after transfection of exogenous E2F1 alone as expected, but the signal was partially reduced by cotransfection with KAP1 (Fig. 1f). This inhibitory effect from KAP1 may be due to its ability to reduce the level of E2F1 acetylation (see below), thus reducing E2F1 DNA binding. These results suggested that KAP1 regulates E2F1 by a combination of DNA binding inhibition and promoter recruitment mechanisms. Mapping of KAP1-E2F1 Interaction Domains—To identify the regions on E2F1 and KAP1 involved in complex formation, FLAG and Myc-tagged KAP1 deletion mutants were cotransfected with E2F1 into 293T cells. Coprecipitation of E2F1 with the KAP1 mutant was determined by KAP1 immunoprecipitation (IP) using epitope-specific antibodies followed by E2F1 Western blot. The results showed that the coiled-coil region of KAP1 from 191–419 was necessary and sufficient for binding E2F1 (Fig. 2a). This region was also involved for binding to MDM2 in a previous study (25Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher III, F.J. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). To map the KAP1 binding domain on E2F1, a panel of FLAG-tagged E2F1 deletion mutants was cotransfected with KAP1 into 293T cells. E2F1 mutants were precipitated with FLAG antibody, and the coprecipitation of KAP1 was detected by Western blot. The results showed that the region between residue 192–382 of E2F1 was required for binding to KAP1 (Fig. 2b). This region includes the “Marked Box” that is implicated in protein-protein interactions in other E2F members and is critical for the induction of apoptosis by E2F1 (32Hallstrom T.C. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Therefore, the KAP1 binding region on E2F1 does not overlap with the C-terminal pRb binding and transcription activation region, suggesting that KAP1-E2F1 binding is independent of pRb, which was further tested below. KAP1-E2F1 Physical and Functional Interaction Is Independent of pRb—A critical regulator of E2F1 is the tumor suppressor pRb. To determine whether E2F1-KAP1 interaction is dependent on pRb or regulated by pRb, Saos2 cells which are deficient for both p53 and pRb were examined. IP-Western blot assay showed interaction of endogenous E2F1 and KAP1 in Saos2 cells similar to the pRb wild type H1299 cells (Fig. 3a), suggesting that E2F1-KAP1 interaction can occur in the absence of pRb. To test whether pRb regulates K2F1-KAP1 binding, Saos2 cells were transiently transfected with E2F1, KAP1, and pRb expression plasmids and analyzed by E2F1 IP-KAP1 Western blot. Coprecipitation between E2F1 and KAP1 was not affected by overexpression of pRb in such assay (Fig. 3b), suggesting that pRb does not regulate the interaction between E2F1 and KAP1. This result is also consistent with the domain-mapping result showing that KAP1 interacts with a region on E2F1 distinct from the pRb binding site. To test whether KAP1 regulates E2F1 in the absence of pRb, Saos2 cells were transfected with E2F1-responsive reporters and E2F1 expression plasmid. Compared with H1299 cells KAP1 showed similar ability to repress E2F1 transcription activation (Fig. 3c). Coexpression of KAP1 and pRb showed moderate cooperation in the repression of E2F1 activity (Fig. 3d). These results showed that KAP1 regulation of E2F1 is independent of pRb and probably represents an additional mechanism of control over E2F1 activity. KAP1 Promotes E2F1-HDAC1 Interaction and Inhibits E2F1 Acetylation—E2F1 inhibition by pRb involves recruitment of HDAC1 and SUV39H1 to E2F1. KAP1-mediated transcriptional repression also involves recruitment of HDAC1 and histone methyltransferase SETDB1. To determine whether KAP1 regulates E2F1 interaction with HDAC1, H1299 cells transiently transfected with E2F1 and FLAG-HDAC1 were analyzed by E2F1 IP and FLAG Western blot. Coexpression of KAP1 significantly stimulated E2F1 coprecipitation with HDAC1 (Fig. 4a), suggesting that KAP1 recruits HDAC1 to E2F1. To test the role of endogenous KAP1 in E2F1-HDAC1 interaction, HT1080 cells with stable KAP1 knock down were examined by E2F1 IP and HDAC1 Western blot. The coprecipitation of endogenous E2F1 and HDAC1 was also reduced in cells depleted of KAP1 (Fig. 4b), suggesting that KAP1 is responsible for a fraction of E2F1-HDAC1 binding in this cell line. In reporter assays, KAP1 deletion mutant without the C-terminal plant homeo domain and bromo domains failed to inhibit E2F1 transactivation function (Fig. 4c), suggesting that recruitment of HDAC1 is important for the repression of E2F1 activity. E2F1 is acetylated at several lysine residues adjacent to the DNA binding domain (Lys-117, -120, -125), which stimulates its binding to DNA. E2F1 acetylation is stimulated by stress such as DNA damage and is inhibited by pRb. However, previous studies of E2F1 acetylation used pan-specific anti-acetyl-lysine antibodies, which leaves uncertainty about the site of acetylation and specificity. To test whether KAP1 binding and recruitment of HDAC1 results in the reduction of E2F1 acetylation level, we generated an acetylated peptide-specific antibody against the Lys-117 site of E2F1. In specificity tests, the anti-Ac-K117 antibody did not cross-react with E2F1 expressed in Escherichia coli, as expected from lack of modifications to E2F1 (Fig. 4d). However, E2F1 cotransfected with the CBP coactivator and acetyltransferase in H1299 cells was strongly reactive to the Ac-K117 antibody (the signal was marginal without immunoprecipitation), suggesting that the antibody was specific for acetylated E2F1 (Fig. 4d). Expression of KAP1 significantly reduced the level of E2F1 acetylation by CREB-binding protein (CBP), which was reversed by treatment with the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A (Fig. 4e). Overexpression of HDAC1 also strongly suppressed E2F1 acetylation by CBP. To further test the specificity and mechanism of E2F1 deacetylation by KAP1, sub-optimal levels of KAP1 and HDAC1 were coexpressed with E2F1 and CBP. Full-length KAP1 and KAP1 mutant (239–835) capable of binding both E2F1 and HDAC1 showed strong cooperation with HDAC1 in blocking E2F1 acetylation without affecting the expression level of CBP. In contrast, KAP1 mutant without the HDAC1 binding site (20–419) failed to cooperate with HDAC1 in E2F1 deacetylation (Fig. 5a). Therefore, KAP1 recruitment of HDAC1 to E2F1 is necessary for the inhibition of E2F1 acetylation, suggesting that the effect was due to active deacetylation by HDAC1. To test the role of endogenous KAP1 in regulating E2F1 acetylation level, U2OS and Saos2 cells with stable knock down of KAP1 were immunoprecipitated using the Ac-K117 antibody, followed by Western blot using E2F1 antibody to determine the amount of acetylated endogenous E2F1. The results showed that KAP1 knock down was associated with significant increases of acetylated E2F1 levels in both cell lines without increase of total E2F1 level (Fig. 5b). KAP1 knock down also cooperated with DNA-damaging agent etoposide in the induction of E2F1 acetylation (Fig. 5b). These results showed that endogenous E2F1 acetylation level is also partially controlled by KAP1 in the cell before and after DNA damage. Knock Down of KAP1 Increases E2F1-mediated Gene Expression and Apoptosis—To test whether KAP1 regulates the activity of endogenous E2F1, Saos2 cells with stable knock down of KAP1 was examined for the expression of several E2F1 target genes. Reduction of KAP1 level resulted in significantly increased expression of cyclin D3, p27, and dihydrofolate reductase in Saos2 cells (Fig. 6a). These results are consistent with increased levels of endogenous E2F1 activity. In transient transfection assays, E2F1 induced apoptosis in the p53-null H1299 cells and overexpression of KAP1 significantly inhibited E2F1-induced apoptosis (Fig. 6b). E2F1 has been shown to be critical for etoposide-induced apoptosis in cells devoid of p53. In Saos2 cells, knock down of KAP1 also increased sensitivity to etoposide by ∼2-fold (Fig. 6c). Infection with adenovirus vector expressing E2F1 resulted in moderate cooperation with etoposide in Saos2 cells, and the effect was significantly enhanced after knock down of KAP1 (Fig. 6c). These results suggest that KAP1 plays a role in regulating the apoptotic function of E2F1 independent of p53 and pRb. However, KAP1 has recently been shown to be phosphorylated by ATM pathway and to function in cell survival after DNA damage, possibly by modifying chromatin conformation in a global scale. Therefore, our results do not rule out the possibility of indirect cooperation between E2F1 activation and KAP1 knock down on cell survival. The results presented above showed that the nuclear corepressor protein KAP1 is involved in the regulation of E2F1 in a pRb-independent fashion. KAP1 binds to E2F1 and recruits HDAC1 to E2F1. This recruitment is responsible for inhibition of E2F1 acetylation, which may reduce the DNA binding affinity of E2F1. Furthermore, KAP1 can be recruited to DNA by E2F1, which may in turn repress transcription from E2F1 target promoters directly. Therefore, the mechanism of KAP1 function is similar to pRb. However, unlike E2F1-pRb binding that is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent fashion by cyclin-dependent kinase 4 phosphorylation of pRb, KAP1 level is not known to undergo cell cycle changes and there is no direct evidence that it undergoes cell cycle-dependent changes in phosphorylation. KAP1 expression level is not regulated by E2F1, and KAP1-E2F1 binding is not affected by cell cycle status (data not shown). Therefore, KAP1 is likely to play a different regulatory role on E2F1 compared with pRb. KAP1 binds to a region on E2F1 distinct from the C-terminal pRb binding site, and the two interactions are not mutually exclusive. Therefore, KAP1 and pRb can potentially regulate E2F1 in a cooperative or additive fashion. Interestingly, the KAP1 binding domain of E2F1 includes the Marked Box that was implicated in protein interaction, regulation of transcriptional activity and promoter selectivity, and induction of apoptosis by E2F1 (32Hallstrom T.C. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10848-10853Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). KAP1 was found as a corepressor protein for the Kruppel-associated box domain transcription repressors and has shown interesting activity in inducing heritable gene silencing and epigenetic modifications of target DNA through recruitment of HDAC, SETDB1, and HP1 proteins (22Ayyanathan K. Lechner M.S. Bell P. Maul G.G. Schultz D.C. Yamada Y. Tanaka K. Torigoe K. Rauscher III, F.J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1855-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Germ line knock out of KAP1 results in early embryonic lethality (20Cammas F. Mark M. Dolle P. Dierich A. Chambon P. Losson R. Development. 2000; 127: 2955-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tissue-specific conditional knock out in mouse testes disrupts spermatogenesis, possibly due to excessive cell death (33Weber P. Cammas F. Gerard C. Metzger D. Chambon P. Losson R. Mark M. Development. 2002; 129: 2329-2337PubMed Google Scholar). Its interaction with HP1 is also important for regulating embryonic stem cell differentiation in response to retinoic acid (34Cammas F. Herzog M. Lerouge T. Chambon P. Losson R. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2147-2160Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent studies revealed important functions of KAP1 in cellular response to DNA damage in mediating chromatin conformational changes on both a global level and at the level of p53 regulation (23Ziv Y. Bielopolski D. Galanty Y. Lukas C. Taya Y. Schultz D.C. Lukas J. Bekker-Jensen S. Bartek J. Shiloh Y. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 870-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar, 25Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher III, F.J. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). KAP1 interacts with the p53 regulator MDM2 through the coiled-coil region and cooperates with MDM2 to deacetylate p53 and inhibit p53 activity (25Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher III, F.J. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). KAP1 knock down leads to increased basal p53 activity and enhanced p53 activation after ionizing irradiation and low dose actinomycin D treatment, which activates p53 without inducing DNA damage (25Wang C. Ivanov A. Chen L. Fredericks W.J. Seto E. Rauscher III, F.J. Chen J. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 3279-3290Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 26Okamoto K. Kitabayashi I. Taya Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 351: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Therefore, KAP1 is involved in regulating basal and stress-activated p53 functions. KAP1 inhibition of E2F1 showed several similarities to p53 regulation. The same region of KAP1 (coiled-coil) was involved in binding E2F1, and KAP1 also recruits HDAC to E2F1 and causes inhibition of E2F1 acetylation. KAP1 knock down also increased basal E2F1 activity and increased E2F1-mediated apoptosis after DNA damage in p53-null cells. These results established KAP1 as a novel regulator of E2F1 independent of pRb and p53. E2F1 and other family members have both oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions. The role of KAP1 in the function and regulation of this complex family remains to be further investigated. The ATM-mediated phosphorylation of KAP1 after DNA damage and the involvement of KAP1 in regulating two DNA damage-inducible proteins (p53 and E2F1) suggest that KAP1 is an important player in cellular response to damage and stress. These connections also suggest that KAP1 may be involved in the development of cancer as an oncogene. The DNA-damage sensitization by KAP1 knock down may be due to both E2F1- and p53-mediated effects. Therefore, targeting the key biochemical activities of KAP1 may be useful for cancer treatment.

https://openalex.org/W1991271769,"Treatment of cultured vertebrate neurons with nitric oxide leads to growth-cone collapse, axon retraction and the reconfiguration of axonal microtubules. We show that the light chain of microtubule-associated protein (MAP) 1B is a substrate for S-nitrosylation in vivo, in cultured cells and in vitro. S-nitrosylation occurs at Cys 2457 in the COOH terminus. Nitrosylation of MAP1B leads to enhanced interaction with microtubules and correlates with the inhibition of neuroblastoma cell differentiation. We further show, in dorsal root ganglion neurons, that MAP1B is necessary for neuronal nitric oxide synthase control of growth-cone size, growth-cone collapse and axon retraction. These results reveal an S-nitrosylation-dependent signal-transduction pathway that is involved in regulation of the axonal cytoskeleton and identify MAP1B as a major component of this pathway. We propose that MAP1B acts by inhibiting a microtubule- and dynein-based mechanism that normally prevents axon retraction."
https://openalex.org/W2168788156,"The Star (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein)-related transfer (START) domain superfamily is characterized by a distinctive lipid-binding motif. START domains typically reside in multidomain proteins, suggesting their function as lipid sensors that trigger biological activities. Phosphatidylcholine transfer protein (PC-TP, also known as StarD2) is an example of a START domain minimal protein that consists only of the lipid-binding motif. PC-TP, which binds phosphatidylcholine exclusively, is expressed during embryonic development and in several tissues of the adult mouse, including liver. Although it catalyzes the intermembrane exchange of phosphatidylcholines in vitro, this activity does not appear to explain the various metabolic alterations observed in mice lacking PC-TP. Here we demonstrate that PC-TP function may be mediated via interacting proteins. Yeast two-hybrid screening using libraries prepared from mouse liver and embryo identified Them2 (thioesterase superfamily member 2) and the homeodomain transcription factor Pax3 (paired box gene 3), respectively, as PC-TP-interacting proteins. These were notable because the START domain superfamily contains multidomain proteins in which the START domain coexists with thioesterase domains in mammals and with homeodomain transcription factors in plants.

However, these effects do not appear to be fully explained by the phosphatidylcholine transfer activity of PC-TP. PC-TP (also known as StarD2) is a member of a steroidogenic acute regulatory protein-related transfer (START) domain protein superfamily (4Ponting C.P. Aravind L. Trends Biochem.

START domains largely reside within multidomain proteins, suggesting that binding of a hydrophobic ligand might regulate activity of another domain within the same protein. By contrast, PC-TP is an example of a minority of so-called START domain minimal proteins, the entire amino acid sequence of which comprises the START domain. Because of the apparent absence of other functional domains, we hypothesized that the biological activities of PC-TP might necessitate protein-protein interactions. PC-TP in mice is expressed in a variety of tissues of the adult animal (9Cohen D.E. Green R.M. Wu M.K. Beier D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1447: 265-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Smith A.J. Borst P. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and as early as embryonic stem cells (10Geijtenbeek T.B.H. Smith A.J. Borst P. Wirtz K.W.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). On this basis, we performed two yeast two-hybrid screens utilizing cDNA libraries prepared from adult mouse liver and from day 9.5–10.5 embryos. PC-TP-interacting proteins included Them2 (thioesterase superfamily member 2) from liver and the homeodomain transcription factor, Pax3 (paired box gene 3) from the embryo. These were noteworthy because the START superfamily contains multidomain proteins that consist of START plus thioesterase domains in mammals, as well as START plus homeodomains in plants (5Alpy F. Tomasetto C. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 2791-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 6Soccio R.E. Breslow J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22183-22186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 8Schrick K. Nguyen D. Karlowski W.M. Mayer K.F. Genome Biol. 2004; 5: R41.1-R41.16Crossref Google Scholar). Them2 and Pax3 were colocalized with PC-TP within tissues and cells. Functional analyses demonstrated that PC-TP increased the acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of Them2, as well as the transcriptional activity of Pax3. These findings suggest that interacting proteins play key roles in the biological functions of PC-TP. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening to Identify PC-TP-interacting Proteins—To identify liver-enriched PC-TP-interacting proteins, we utilized the Matchmaker GAL4 yeast two-hybrid system 3 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). Briefly, the coding sequence of mouse PC-TP cDNA was cloned into pGBKT7, which expresses GAL4BD to create a PC-TP:GAL4BD fusion protein. The PC-TP:GAL4BD construct was cotransformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiae AH109 cells with a mouse liver cDNA library cloned into the pACT2 GAL4AD reporter vector. Double transformants containing interacting proteins were identified according to growth on selective media. These were further screened under highest stringency conditions using three yeast reporter genes, one of which conferred survival on selective media, as well as two separate color-based selection genes. This approach offered the advantage of markedly reducing the likelihood of detecting false positive interactions. The main disadvantage was that low affinity protein-protein interactions were less likely to be detected. In preliminary experiments, we verified robust PC-TP protein expression in mouse embryos at days 9.5 and 10.5 by immunoblot analysis, as well as representation of PC-TP by Southern blot analysis in a mouse embryonic day 9.5–10.5 cDNA library (11Vojtek A.B. Hollenberg S.M. Cooper J.A. Cell. 1993; 74: 205-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1660) Google Scholar, 12Alland L. Muhle R. Hou Jr., H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), which was generously provided by Dr. Nicole Schreiber-Agus (Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY). The coding sequence of human PC-TP cDNA was cloned into pBTM116 containing the binding domain of the yeast transcription factor LexA (LexABD). This was transformed into the S. cerevisiae L40 reporter strain together with mouse embryonic cDNA library cloned into pVP16 containing the LexA activation domain (LexAAD) (13Gietz R.D. Woods R.A. Methods Enzymol. 2002; 350: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (2069) Google Scholar). Double transformants containing interacting proteins were selected based on reporter gene activity that conferred survival on selective media, with care taken to exclude false positives (14Gietz R.D. Triggs-Raine B. Robbins A. Graham K.C. Woods R.A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 172: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Purified cDNA:LexAAD plasmids were retransformed into L40 reporter strain expressing PC-TP: LexABD to confirm positive interactions. Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells were cultured in a controlled environment (37 °C, 5% CO2) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection of plasmids was performed using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST Pulldown Assay—GST pulldown assays were carried out to confirm protein-protein interactions observed by yeast two-hybrid screening. Recombinant GST and GST-PC-TP fusion proteins were expressed using pGEX-KG as described previously (15Feng L. Chan W.W. Roderick S.L. Cohen D.E. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 15399-15409Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, PC-TP coding sequences from human (hPC-TP) or mouse (mPC-TP) were cloned in frame to create fusion proteins with GST attached to the N termini. The pGEX-KG vector alone was used to express recombinant GST. Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was induced by overnight culture at room temperature in LB supplemented with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. For GST pulldown assays, bacteria (100 ml) were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in 10 ml of lysis buffer consisting of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The supernatant containing recombinant proteins was collected following centrifugation at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. Recombinant proteins were immobilized by the addition of 100 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 2 h at 4°C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 1,500 × g for 1 min, and the beads were washed five times with PBS. Both endogenously and heterologously expressed proteins in HEK 293T cells were pulled down. For heterologous protein expression, a cDNA encoding mThem2 (GenBank™ accession number NM 025790) was cloned into pEFF-N to create pEFF-mThem2, which encodes Them2 with an N-terminal FLAG tag driven by an EF1a promoter. The plasmid pcDNA3-mPax3-HA (16Lang D. Epstein J.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was a gift from Drs. Deborah Lang and Jonathan Epstein (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Twenty-four hours after plasmid transfections, HEK 293T cells were lysed by the addition of 2 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm culture dish. Following 5 min of centrifugation at 14,000 × g to remove cellular debris, the lysates were incubated with GST or GST-PC-TP fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (100 μl) for 3 h at 4–37°C. The beads were washed five times with lysis buffer, and then bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and subjected to immunoblotting. A monoclonal anti-FLAG mouse antibody was from Sigma, and a polyclonal anti-HA rabbit antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A peptide designed to match the 14-amino acid sequence of the C terminus of human Them2 plus one cysteine residue added to the N terminus was synthesized and covalently attached to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. This protein-linked peptide was used as an antigen to produce rabbit anti-human Them2 polyclonal antiserum (Covance Research Products, Denver, PA). Detection of primary antibodies was with ECL (Amersham Biosciences) using goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Bio-Rad). Loading of GST or GST-PC-TP fusion proteins was assessed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Quantitative Real Time PCR—cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with GeneAmp Gold RNA PCR Core Kit (Applied Biosystems). Specific PCR primers were designed for hThem2 (forward, 5′-CAACAATGGCTCTGCTATGC-3′; reverse, 5′-ATTTTCCTGTGGCCTTGTTG-3′) using Primer 3 (frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi) with nucleotide sequences obtained from GenBank™. Real time PCR was performed with Lightcycler 1.5 system using Lightcycler FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green 1 (Roche Applied Science). The expression data were normalized to the endogenous control, cyclophilin (17Zhang Y. Kast-Woelbern H.R. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 104-110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The relative expression levels were calculated according to the formula 2-ΔCt, where ΔCt is the difference in threshold cycle (Ct) values between Them2 and cyclophilin. Tissue Distribution of Them2—To examine tissue-specific expression, a mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (Clontech) was hybridized with 32P-labeled full-length mThem2 and mPC-TP cDNAs. cDNAs were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a random primer DNA labeling kit (Invitrogen). Following autoradiography for each cDNA probe, the blot was stripped. A 32P-labeled β-actin cDNA was used as a loading control. The relative distribution of Them2 in cell types of the liver was assessed by quantitative real time PCR using cDNA prepared from HepG2 cells, LX1 stellate cells (gift from Dr. Scott Friedman, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY), human peripheral blood monocytes (gift from Dr. Bruce Levy, Harvard Medical School), and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; gift from Dr. Jorge Plutzky, Harvard Medical School). Distribution of PC-TP in Mouse Embryo—In situ hybridization was performed (18Berger U.V. Hediger M.A. J. Comp. Neurol. 2000; 421: 385-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) on frozen sections of day 9.5 and 10.5 embryos using a digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probe that contained 373 bases of probe Pctp sequence. The controls were performed using an identical concentration of a sense probe. Intracellular Localization of Proteins—Endogenously expressed Them2 and PC-TP were visualized in HEK 293T cells by immunofluorescence using confocal microscopy. The Them2 antibody was described above, and a rabbit anti-human PC-TP antibody was previously described (19Shoda J. Oda K. Suzuki H. Sugiyama Y. Ito K. Cohen D.E. Feng L. Kamiya J. Nimura Y. Miyazaki H. Kano M. Matsuzaki Y. Tanaka N. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1194-1205Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells were rinsed three times with PBS and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then permeabilized and exposed to immune or preimmune antisera at a 1:250 dilution. For visualization, the cells were incubated with a 1:500 dilution of Alexa Flour 495 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and mounted under coverslips in ProLong Gold mounting medium (Molecular Probes) containing a 1:1,000 dilution of the nuclear stain TO-PRO-3 (Molecular Probes). The cells were imaged using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences confocal system that was driven by Intelligent Imaging Innovations software and included a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope interfaced to a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal head paired with a Melles Griot Kr/Ar laser illumination source and a Hamamatsu Orca ERG cooled CCD camera for digitization. An Apple PowerMac G4 work station was used for image capture and processing with Slidebook software. For visualization of fluorescent fusion proteins, the plasmids pAcGFP-N1 (Clontech) and pJag195 (generous gift from Dr. Jagesh V. Shah, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), respectively, were used to prepare GFP-PC-TP (pAcGFP-N1-mPC-TP) or monomeric red fluorescent protein (RFP)-Them2 (pJag195-mThem2) or RFP-Pax3 (pJag195-mPax3) by cloning the open reading frames of mPC-TP, mThem2, and mPax3, respectively. Them2 and Pax3 were cloned 3′ to the coding sequence of RFP to fuse the RFP protein to the N terminus of the proteins. A GFP-PC-TP fusion protein was created by cloning full-length mPC-TP 5′ to the coding sequence of GFP, so that the fluorescent protein was fused to the C terminus. HEK 293T cells were plated on glass coverslips at a density of 5 × 105 cells/well in six-well plates. Twenty-four hours following transfection with either recombinant or empty plasmids, the cells were fixed. HEK 293T cells were rinsed three times with PBS, fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, and mounted under coverslips in VECTASHIELD mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) containing TO-PRO-3. The cells were visualized under a Nikon E800 a fixed stage upright microscope controlled by Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal system. The images were acquired and processed using Lasersharp 2000. Expression and Purification of Recombinant PC-TP and Them2—For bacterial expression of His tag recombinant proteins, the open reading frames of mouse Them2 and PC-TP were each cloned into pET19b (Novagen). Plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3), and protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to LB followed by 24 h of shaking (250 rpm) at room temperature. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation and lysed by sonication in PBS supplemented with EDTA-free protease inhibitor and centrifuged (100,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C). His tag proteins contained in the bacterial supernatants were adsorbed to a nickel affinity column composed of 1.0 ml of immobilized iminodiacetic acid resin (Pierce), which was packed into a C10/10 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and chelated with 100 mm NiSO4. The proteins were eluted using a stepped imidazole gradient (6 mm × 5 ml and 300 mm × 5 ml). For further purification, fractions containing PC-TP or Them2 were pooled and applied to a XK16/100 column packed with Sepharose G-100SF (GE Healthcare) and equilibrated with buffer (20 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2% NaN2). Following purification, His tag recombinant proteins yielded single bands as assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Protein concentrations were determined according to their molar extinction coefficients at 280 nm, which were calculated based on amino acid sequences (www.expasy.org). Influence of PC-TP on Enzymatic Activity of Them2—Acyl-CoA thioesterase activity of Them2 was measured as described (20Alexson S.E. Nedergaard J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13564-13571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications. Activity was determined using 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) to detect CoA release spectrophotometrically at 412 nm. The reaction buffer consisted of 50 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.3 mm DTNB plus 100 μm myristoyl-CoA (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) as substrate. Purified recombinant His tag mThem2 and mPC-TP were added at varying concentrations in a final volume of 200 μl. The reaction was monitored at 37 °C in a 96-well plate using a Molecular Devices Versamax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Influence of Them2 on Phosphatidylcholine Transfer Activity of PC-TP—Phosphatidylcholine transfer activity of PC-TP was measured by modification of a fluorescence assay (21Nichols J.W. Pagano R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5368-5371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Donor phospholipids vesicles prepared by sonication of 0.5 μm phospholipids in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, contained egg phosphatidylcholine (Avanti Polar Lipids), 2-(12-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino) dodecanoyl-1-hexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (NBD-PC) (Invitrogen), and Lissamine rhodamine B 1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt (rhodamine DHPE) (Invitrogen) (molar ratio egg phosphatidylcholine: NBD-PC:rhodamine DHPE of 94:1:5). Fluorescent phosphatidylcholines in these donor vesicles were quenched. Acceptor vesicles (0.5 μm phospholipids in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) were prepared by sonication of egg phosphatidylcholine and egg phosphatidic acid (Avanti Polar Lipids) in a ratio of 95:5. In 96-well plates, 30 μl of acceptor vesicles were added to 50 μl of buffer (0.9% NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) in each well. Purified His tag mPC-TP and mThem2 were added to wells for varying final concentrations. Buffer was added to each well for a total volume of 135 μl. At time 0, 15 μl of donor vesicles were added to each well simultaneously using a multi-channel pipettor. The plates were immediately loaded into a Spectramax M5 fluorimeter (Molecular Devices). The excitation wavelength was 475 nm, and the emission wavelength was 535 nm. The plates were shaken for 2 s, and 10 readings of each well were averaged every 6 s for 10 min. Increases in fluorescence intensity reflected transfer of NBD-PC by PC-TP from quenched donor vesicles containing rhodamine DHPE to unquenched acceptor vesicles. Apparent rates of phosphatidylcholine transfer from donor and acceptor vesicles were determined by fitting fluorescence intensities (F(t)) to the function F(t) = Aexp(-kt) + B using Prism 4 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), where k is the apparent first order rate constant, A is the amplitude, and B is a constant (22Zucker S.D. Storch J. Zeidel M.L. Gollan J.L. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3184-3192Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Influence of PC-TP on Transcriptional Activity of Pax3—The influence of PC-TP on transcriptional activity of Pax3 was examined using a dual luciferase assay. The plasmids pCMV-mPax3 and pGL3-MITF, a promoter firefly luciferase reporter construct of MITF, a Pax3 transcriptional target gene, were provided by Dr. Jonathan Epstein (23Lang D. Chen F. Milewski R. Li J. Lu M.M. Epstein J.A. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 106: 963-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 24Bondurand N. Pingault V. Goerich D.E. Lemort N. Sock E. Caignec C.L. Wegner M. Goossens M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1907-1917Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The plasmid pcDNA3.1-hPC-TP was previously described (25Baez J.M. Barbour S.E. Cohen D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6198-6206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). HEK 293T cells (2 × 104) were seeded in 96-well plates. This was followed in 24 h by transfection with 73.5 ng of pGL3-MITF, 3.5 ng of pCMV-Pax3, 1.5 ng of pRL-TK (Renilla luciferase; Promega) as a control transfection for transfection efficiency, and variable amounts (0–35 ng) of pcDNA3.1-hPC-TP. Total amount of DNA was kept constant at 150 ng by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. After 72 h, firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a TR717 Microplate Luminometer (Applied Biosystems, Bedford, MA) using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Statistical Analysis—The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. The statistical significance of the differences between the means of experimental groups was tested using Student's t test. A difference was considered statistically significant for a two-tailed p < 0.05. Identification of Them2 and Pax3 as PC-TP-interacting Proteins—To identify proteins binding to PC-TP, we screened cDNA libraries from mouse liver and from mouse day 9.5–10.5 embryos in yeast two-hybrid assays using PC-TP as the bait. The liver library screen utilized mPC-TP and yielded only 20 clones, which encoded 10 different PC-TP-interacting proteins. Two of the pACT2 GALAD clones encoded mThem2. The screen of the embryonic library was performed using hPC-TP and yielded 320 clones. A smaller subset of clones was sequenced, and this revealed three different nucleotide sequences, one of which encoded Pax3. Each of three different cDNAs was also used to prepare 32P-labeled probes, which were separately hybridized to colony lifts of the original 320 clones. This revealed that the three different clones were represented in roughly equal proportions and accounted for 96% of all clones isolated in the screen. Them2 was not identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen of the embryonic library, and Pax3 was not identified in the screen of the liver library. In Vitro Verification of PC-TP-Protein Interactions—We utilized GST pulldown assays to verify the interactions detected by the yeast two-hybrid screen. Fig. 1A demonstrates in transfected HEK 293T cells that FLAG tag Them2 interacted with a GST-mPC-TP fusion protein but not with GST alone, even when excess GST was utilized in the pulldown (Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining panel). This interaction was not observed at 4 °C but was detected at room temperature and was enhanced as the temperature was increased to 37 °C. Immunoblot analysis revealed that HEK293T cells expressed endogenous Them2 and PC-TP (not shown), and the GST pulldown was confirmed at 37 °C in nontransfected HEK 293T cells (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, HA tag Pax3 expressed in HEK 293T cells was precipitated with GST-hPC-TP conjugated to beads but not with an excess of GST-conjugated beads alone, which is demonstrated by the Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining panel. This was the case at both 4 and at 25 °C. For Them2 and Pax3, the same pulldown results were obtained whether we used GST-hPC-TP or GST-mPC-TP, indicating that PC-TP protein interactions were not species-dependent (data not shown). This is in keeping with the high degree of conservation of these three proteins, with percentages of identity/similarity for human and mouse PC-TP, Them2 and Pax3 of 81/86, 83/92, and 98/99%, respectively. Tissue Distributions of PC-TP-interacting Proteins—To assess the potential biological relevance of PC-TP interactions with Them2 in liver and Pax3 in the embryo, we first determined whether the proteins displayed the same cellular expression in these respective tissues. As shown in Fig. 2A, hybridization using a multiple tissue Northern blot revealed substantial expression of Them2 mRNA in heart, brain, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, in general agreement with recent observations by reverse transcription-PCR in human tissues (26Cheng Z. Bao S. Shan X. Xu H. Gong W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 850-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). As confirmed here, PC-TP is expressed in mouse liver as well as other tissues (27van Helvoort A. de Brouwer A. Ottenhoff R. Brouwers J.F. Wijnholds J. Beijnen J.H. Rijneveld A. van der Poll T. van d"

HCV genome replication occurs in the replication complex (RC) around the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. However, the mechanisms regulating the HCV RC remain widely unknown. Here, we used a chemical biology approach to show that estrogen receptor (ESR) is functionally associated with HCV replication. We found that tamoxifen suppressed HCV genome replication. Part of ESRα resided on the endoplasmic reticulum membranes and interacted with HCV RNA polymerase NS5B. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of endogenous ESRα reduced HCV replication.

ESR consists of two subtypes, ESRα and ESRβ. As a primary physiological function, ESR is involved in the transcription for downstream genes in response to stimulation by the ligand, estradiol. In the normal state, ESR is mainly located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Upon binding of the ligand, ESR dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus, where it binds to the ESR-responsive elements (ERE) in the DNA promoter of downstream genes and drives transcription. In addition to this classical genomic action, a portion of ESR is located on the membrane, such as the plasma membrane, and involved in the nongenomic function of triggering signal transduction pathways, such as mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and protein kinase C (2Acconcia F. Kumar R. Cancer Lett. 2006; 238: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 3Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2005; 19: 1951-1959Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 4Song R.X. Zhang Z.

Although the molecular basis of ESR membrane retention is not fully understood, one mechanism involves a membrane protein, caveolin (CAV); ESRα interacted with CAV, and this interaction facilitated ESRα localization to the membrane (5Razandi M.

Welshons W.V. Pietras R.J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2006; 246: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The lipid rafts are microdomains of the membrane that form platforms enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. However, the characteristics and relevance of membrane-associated ESR have not been fully disclosed. Here, we report the novel role of ESRα in the regulation of viral replication. Hepatitis C virus (HCV), a causative agent of chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma, constitutes a serious health problem worldwide (8Liang T.J. Jeffers L.J. Reddy K.R.

HCV has a positive strand RNA genome that produces at least 10 functional viral proteins: core, envelope 1, envelope 2, p7, nonstructural protein 2 (NS2), NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (9Grakoui A.

HCV genome replication can be evaluated using a HCV subgenomic replicon system, which Lohmann et al. (13Lohmann V. Korner F. Koch J. Herian U. Theilmann L. Bartenschlager R. Science. 1999; 285: 110-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (2498) Google Scholar) first established. In this system, cells carry an HCV subgenome RNA encoding NS3 to NS5B. Using this system, it has been proposed that HCV genome replication occurs in the replication complex (RC), which contains the viral genome RNA and HCV NS proteins. The RC forms on the surface of the intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, and is surrounded by a membrane structure (14Aizaki H. Lee K.J. Sung V.M. Ishiko H. Lai M.M. Virology. 2004; 324: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 15Egger D. Wolk B. Gosert R. Bianchi L. Blum H.E. Moradpour D. Bienz K. J.

Antiviral Res. 2003; 60: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). It also has been reported that HCV genome replication associates with the lipid rafts on these intracellular membranes, such as the ER membrane (14Aizaki H. Lee K.J. Sung V.M. Ishiko H. Lai M.M. Virology. 2004; 324: 450-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 18Shi S.T. Lee K.J. Aizaki H. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4160-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These lipid rafts accumulate CAV2, and HCV proteins involved in viral genome replication cofractionate with CAV2 (18Shi S.T. Lee K.J. Aizaki H. Hwang S.B. Lai M.M. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 4160-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). However, it is largely unknown how the RC is formed and under what mechanism the HCV proteins participate in the RC. A chemical biology approach is a useful method to analyze the molecular mechanism of viral life cycles as well as cellular physiological processes (19Watashi K. Shimotohno K. Rev. Med. Virol. 2007; 17: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We employed forward chemical genetics in which we analyzed HCV replication activity as a phenotypic indicator of a cell-based assay to screen chemical compounds that inhibited HCV replication. Using this system, we previously identified an immunosuppressant, cyclosporin A, as an anti-HCV compound (20Watashi K. Hijikata M. Hosaka M. Yamaji M. Shimotohno K. Hepatology. 2003; 38: 1282-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). We also reported that cyclophilin B regulated the RNA binding activity of NS5B (21Watashi K. Ishii N. Hijikata M. Inoue D.

In the current study, this chemical screening approach linked ESRα to HCV replication. We showed that tamoxifen (TAM) suppressed HCV genome replication. Using TAM as a bioprobe, we found that ESRα interacted with NS5B and regulated the participation of NS5B in the RC. Cell Culture and Transfection—Huh-7 and cured MH-14 cells (21Watashi K. Ishii N.

To observe HCV amplification, HCV RNA in the cells was quantified, since HCV RNA was hardly detected significantly in the culture medium (23Aly H.H. Watashi K. Hijikata M. Kaneko H. Takada Y.

HCV replication activity, monitored by luciferase activity (22Goto K. Watashi K. Murata T. Hishiki T. Hijikata M. Shimotohno K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 343: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and the amount of HCV RNA were decreased with TAM treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A and B). The expression of HCV proteins, NS5A and NS5B, detected by immunoblot (Fig. 1C) and indirect immuofluorescence analyses (Fig. 1D), also drastically decreased by treatment with TAM. A high concentration of TAM decreased cell proliferation (Fig. 1E). However, TAM suppressed HCV replication without any cytotoxicity in another cell line, HuS-E7/DN24 cells (Fig. 6, C and D). In addition, a pure anti-estrogen compound ICI182780, which had little cytotoxic effect, reduced HCV RNA (Fig. 1, F and G). Moreover, TAM inhibited the production of core in the culture medium of HCV JFH1-transfected cells, in a recently developed system of the production of infectious HCV particles (Fig. 1H) (28Lindenbach B.D.

ESR Was Involved in HCV Genome Replication—Next, we investigated which cellular protein TAM targets to suppress HCV replication. It has been reported that TAM targets 1) ESR (31Shang Y. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 360-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), 2) P-glycoprotein (32Callaghan R. Higgins C.F. Br. J. Cancer. 1995; 71: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 33Raderer M. Scheithauer W. Cancer. 1993; 72: 3553-3563Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), 3) calmodulin (34Lopes M.C.

Cancer Inst. 1988; 80: 1628-1633Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), etc. Although other compounds targeting P-glycoprotein, calmodulin, and protein kinase C did not affect HCV replication in our screening (data not shown), ESR was suggested to play a role in HCV replication as shown below. RNAi-mediated specific knockdown of endogenous ESRα and ESRβ (Fig. 2A) reduced HCV RNA in replicon-containing cells to ∼20-40% and 60-70%, respectively (Fig. 2B). Transient transfection with ESRα and ESRβ expression plasmids, which activated ERE-driven transcription 4-5-fold (Fig. 2C), showed that ectopically expressed ESRα augmented HCV replication activity in a dose-dependent manner, whereas ESRβ did not (Fig. 2D). ESRα-induced augmentation of the replication was reversed upon TAM treatment (Fig. 2D). These results suggested a significant role of ESR, especially ESRα, in HCV genome replication. ESRα(L540Q), carrying a leucine to glutamine point mutation at aa 540 within the LXXLL motif (aa 536-540) of ESRα (37Leers J. Treuter E. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell.

The intermediate type PrPSc was seen in all examined dura mater graft-associated CJD cases with 129M/M and plaque-type PrP deposits (p-dCJD). p-dCJD prions and sCJD-VV2 prions exhibited similar transmissibility and neuropathology, and the identical type of PrPSc when inoculated into PrP-humanized mice with 129M/M or 129V/V.

A transmission study using transgenic mice expressing human PrP revealed that the congruency of the genotype at codon 129 between the inoculum and the inoculated transgenic mice determines the susceptibility to sCJD prions (12Korth C.

Transmission of sCJD prions to mice with an incongruent genotype (referred to as cross-sequence transmission) results in a relatively long incubation period. The potential for cross-sequence transmission should be considered in the iatrogenic transmission of CJD via cadaveric pituitary hormones, dura mater and corneal grafts, or contaminated neurosurgical instruments. More than half of the reported cases of dura mater graft-associated CJD (dCJD) occurred in Japan, where 123 cases have been recognized as of February 2006 (13Brown P. Preece M. Brandel J.P. Sato T.

In Europe, 28.4% of sCJD patients are valine homozygotes (129V/V) or methionine/valine heterozygotes at codon 129 (129M/V) (5Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O.

Meanwhile, the population data show a high prevalence (91.6%) of methionine homozygosity (129M/M) in Japanese people (17Doh-ura K. Kitamoto T. Sakaki Y. Tateishi J. Nature. 1991; 353: 801-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that part of the Japanese dCJD cases might have been caused by cross-sequence transmission of sCJD prions. In fact, there are two distinct phenotypes in dCJD, with the majority represented by a non-plaque type of dCJD (np-dCJD) and the minority by a plaque-type dCJD (p-dCJD) (18Shimizu S. Hoshi K.

Yoshino H. Urata J. Nakamura Y. Yanagawa H. Sato T. Neurology. 2000; 55: 718-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In contrast, p-dCJD cases show unique features characterized by (i) the absence or late occurrence of myoclonus and periodic synchronous discharges on electroencephalogram; (ii) a long incubation period after grafting and a clinical course of long duration, and (iii) plaque-type PrP deposits in the brain (18Shimizu S.

Although we have classified p-dCJD cases into MM1, the clinicopathological features of p-dCJD are quite different from those of sCJD-MM1 or np-dCJD (18Shimizu S. Hoshi K. Muramoto T. Homma M.

Virol. 2003; 84: 2885-2893Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The reason for the existence of two distinct phenotypes in dCJD has remained elusive. To identify the origin of p-dCJD, we inoculated sCJD prions into mice expressing human PrP with either 129M/M or 129V/V. Here we report that cross-sequence transmission of sCJD prions from a patient with 129V/V and type 2 PrPSc (sCJD-VV2 prions) caused phenotypes similar to those of p-dCJD. Production of Knock-in Mice and Transgenic Mice—The production of knock-in mice expressing human PrP with 129M/M (Ki-Hu129M/M) and Ki-Hu129V/V mice has been reported previously (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Knock-in mice expressing human PrP with 129M/M and four octapeptide repeats (Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R), transgenic mice expressing human PrP with 129M and four octapeptide repeats (Tg-Hu129M4R), and Tg-Hu129M mice were generated as described (26Kitamoto T.

Commun. 2002; 294: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To evaluate the effect of overexpression of the PrP gene, Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R, Ki-Hu129M/M, and Ki-Hu129V/V mice were crossed with Tg-Hu129M4R, Tg-Hu129M, or Tg-Hu129V mice (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The expression levels of human PrP in the brains from Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R, Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M, and Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V mice were 9.8×, 1.2×, and 2.1×, respectively, the levels observed in Ki-Hu129M/M or Ki-Hu129V/V mice. Human Brain Inocula—Brain tissues were obtained at autopsy from CJD patients after receiving informed consent for research use. The diagnosis of CJD and the type of PrPSc were confirmed by neuropathological examination, PrPSc immunohistochemistry, and Western blotting as described (28Kitamoto T. Shin R.W. Doh-ura K.

The genotype and the absence of mutations in the coding region of the PrP gene were determined by sequence analysis (30Kitamoto T. Ohta M. Doh-ura K. Hitoshi S. Terao Y. Tateishi J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 191: 709-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Transmission Experiments—Human brain homogenates (10%) and mouse brain homogenates (10%) were prepared as described (27Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Transmission studies were performed using 20 μl of the homogenates for intracerebral inoculation or 50 μl for intraperitoneal inoculation (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N.

Intracerebrally inoculated mice were sacrificed after the onset of disease, and their brains were immediately frozen or fixed in 10% buffered formalin. Intraperitoneally inoculated mice were sacrificed at 75 days post-inoculation, and their spleens were immediately frozen or formalin-fixed. Immunohistochemistry—Formalin-fixed mouse brains and spleens were treated with 60% formic acid for 1 h to inactivate the infectivity and embedded in paraffin. Tissue sections were pretreated by hydrolytic autoclaving before PrP immunohistochemistry (28Kitamoto T. Shin R.W. Doh-ura K. Tomokane N. Miyazono M. Muramoto T. Tateishi J. Am. J. Pathol. 1992; 140: 1285-1294PubMed Google Scholar). The PrP-N antiserum was used as the primary antibody (31Kitamoto T. Muramoto T. Hilbich C. Beyreuther K. Tateishi J. Brain Res. 1991; 545: 319-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulins polyclonal antibody labeled with the peroxidase-conjugated dextran polymer, EnVision+ (DakoCytomation) were used as the secondary antibody. Western Blotting—PrPSc was extracted from human brains or mouse brains and spleens with collagenase treatment as described (32Grathwohl K.U.D. Horiuchi M. Ishiguro N. Shinagawa M. Arch. Virol. 1996; 141: 1863-1874Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) with some modifications. For deglycosylation of PrP, samples were treated with PNGase F (New England Biolabs). Samples were subjected to 13.5% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting as described (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were used as the primary antibodies. Anti-mouse EnVision+ and anti-rabbit EnVision+ were used as the secondary antibodies. Statistical Analysis—Incubation times are expressed as mean ± S.E. Transmission of sCJD Prions to PrP-humanized Mice with 129M/M or 129V/V—To investigate whether strain-dependent traits of sCJD prions can be inherited through cross-sequence transmission, we performed intracerebral inoculation of a brain homongenate from a sCJD-MM1 patient (H3) or that from a sCJD-VV2 patient (AK) into PrP humanized mice with the 129M/M or 129V/V genotype. For sCJD-MM1 prions, the incubation times of Ki-Hu129V/V mice were 542 and 648 days (number of diseased animals/number of inoculated animals = 2/5), which were longer than those of Ki-Hu129M/M mice (467 ± 24 days, 8/8) (Table 1). For sCJD-VV2 prions, the mean incubation time of Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice was 723 ± 79 days (4/4), which was longer than that of Ki-Hu129V/V mice (312 ± 7 days, 4/4). Immunohistochemical analysis showed diffuse synaptic-type PrP deposits in the brains from both Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M and Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with sCJD-MM1 prions (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions showed small plaque-type PrP deposits in the cerebral white matter and granular to diffuse synaptic-type deposits in the gray matter. The plaque-type PrP deposits were more prominent in the brains from Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions, in which larger plaque-type PrP deposits spread throughout the cerebral gray matter and thalamus rather than the white matter. Western blot analysis revealed that the size of PrPres in the brains was maintained after cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-MM1 prions but not sCJD-VV2 prions (Fig. 1, B and C). Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with sCJD-MM1 prions produced type 1 PrPres (hereafter denoted as VV[MM1]1 PrPres:host genotype[inoculated prions]type of generated PrPres), which were identical in size to MM[MM1]1 PrPres from Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice. However, Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions produced unusual PrPres that were larger than VV[VV2]2 PrPres from Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V mice but smaller than MM[MM1]1 or VV[MM1]1 PrPres. We designated this intermediate-sized PrPres as MM[VV2]2Sh+, PrPres with an upward size shift (Sh+) from the inoculated type 2 template. The shift in the size of PrPres and the prominent plaque formation in Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice indicated that the strain-dependent traits of sCJD-VV2 prions were modified through cross-sequence transmission.TABLE 1Transmission of sCJD prions to humanized mice with 129M/M or 129V/VInoculumIncubation periodKi-Hu129M/M (1×)aThe expression levels of human PrP in the brainsTg+Ki-Hu129M/M (1.2×)Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R (9.8×)Ki-Hu129V/V (1×)Tg+Ki-Hu129V/V (2.1×)days ± S.E.

CJD patients with the 129M/M genotype and plaque-type PrP deposits have been mainly recognized in vCJD and p-dCJD. To date, we have classified vCJD cases into MM2B and p-dCJD cases into MM1. However, there has been an exceptional case of p-dCJD that showed the accumulation of PrPres intermediate in size between type 1 and type 2 (20Kretzschmar H.A. Sethi S. Földvári Z. Windl O. Querner V. Zerr I. Poser S. Brain Pathol. 2003; 13: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The occurrence of plaque-type PrP deposits and MM[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres in Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions raised the possibility that p-dCJD could be caused by cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions. To address this possibility, we re-examined carefully the size of PrPres in the brains from three p-dCJD patients. Western blot analysis showed that the size of PrPres from p-dCJD cases was smaller than that of MM1 PrPres from sCJD-MM1 or np-dCJD cases (Fig. 2, A and B). Therefore, it appeared that the intermediate type PrPres reported by Kretzschmar and colleagues (20Kretzschmar H.A. Sethi S. Földvári Z. Windl O. Querner V. Zerr I. Poser S.

We designated this intermediate type PrPres observed in p-dCJD cases as MMi PrPres. Transmission of p-dCJD Prions to PrP-humanized Mice with 129M/M or 129V/V—To investigate the transmissibility of p-dCJD prions, we performed intracerebral inoculation of brain homogenates from p-dCJD patients (KR, KD, TV) into PrP-humanized mice with the 129M/M or 129V/V genotype. We had already established Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice expressing human PrP with 129M/M and four octapeptide repeats before we produced Ki-Hu129M/M mice expressing human PrP with five octapeptide repeats. The four or five octapeptide repeats of human PrP are polymorphisms unassociated with CJD (33Palmer M.S. Mahal S.P. Campbell T.A. Hill A.F. Sidle K.C.L. Laplanche J.L. Collinge J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). For sCJD-MM1 prions, these Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice showed long incubation times of >600 days in our preliminary experiment (data not shown). Therefore, they were crossed with Tg-Hu129M4R mice to overexpress the human PrP gene. Because these Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice were highly susceptible to sCJD-MM1 prions (175 ± 4 days, 9/9) (Table 1), we used them as PrP-humanized mice with the 129M/M genotype in this experiment at first. All of Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R and Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions developed disease (Table 2). The mean incubation times of Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice were 398 ± 10, 420 ± 10, and 584 ± 65 days. Though the expression level of human PrP in Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice was 9.8-fold higher than that of Ki-Hu129V/V mice, the mean incubation times of Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice were longer than those of Ki-Hu129V/V mice (259 ± 6 and 304 ± 13 days). For np-dCJD, the mean incubation times of Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice were 161 ± 5 (5/5) and 208 ± 2 days (5/5). Immunohistochemical analysis of the brains from Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions showed a few plaque-type PrP deposits similar to those in Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions (Fig. 3A). Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions showed small plaque-type PrP deposits in the cerebral white matter and granular to diffuse synaptic-type deposits in the gray matter similar to those in Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions. There was no plaque-type PrP deposits in the brains from Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with np-dCJD prions (Fig. 3B). Western blot analysis revealed that Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions produced the intermediate type PrPres (M4RM4R[MMi]i PrPres), which were identical in size to M4RM4R[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres (Fig. 3, C and D). Furthermore, Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions produced type 2 PrPres (VV[MMi]2 PrPres), which were identical in size to VV[VV2]2 PrPres. Thus, p-dCJD prions and sCJD-VV2 prions were similar in the transmissibility, the patterns of PrP deposition, and the size of PrPres (the intermediate type in Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R or type 2 in Ki-Hu129V/V) in PrP-humanized mice.TABLE 2Transmission of p-dCJD prions or sCJD-VV2 prions to humanized mice with 129M/M or 129V/VInoculumGenotypeIncubation periodTg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4RKi-Hu129V/Vdays ± S.E.

Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with sCJD-MM1 prions produced M4RM4R[MM1]1 PrPres identical in size to MM[MM1]1 PrPres from Ki-Hu129M/M mice (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions produced M4RM4R[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres identical in size to MM[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres from Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice (Fig. 3E). We inoculated intracerebrally a brain homogenate from a p-dCJD patient (KD) into Ki-Hu129M/M mice besides Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice. The mean incubation time of these Ki-Hu129M/M mice was 500 ± 59 days (4/4). These mice produced MM[MMi]i PrPres identical in size to M4RM4R[MMi]i PrPres from Tg+Ki-Hu129M4R/M4R mice (Fig. 3F). Intraperitoneal Transmission of p-dCJD Prions or sCJD-VV2 Prions to PrP-humanized Mice with 129M/M or 129V/V—To confirm the similarity in the transmissibility between p-dCJD prions and sCJD-VV2 prions, we performed intraperitoneal inoculation of the brain homogenate from a p-dCJD patient (KD) or that from a sCJD-VV2 patient (AK) into PrP-humanized mice as described previously (27Kitamoto T. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Miyoshi I. Tanaka T. Kitamoto N. Itohara S. Kasai N. Katsuki M. Higuchi J. Muramoto T. Shin R.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 294: 280-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analysis of the spleens at 75 days post-inoculation revealed that Ki-Hu129V/V mice were more susceptible to p-dCJD prions than Ki-Hu129M/M mice (Fig. 4A). Similarly, Ki-Hu129V/V mice were more susceptible to sCJD-VV2 prions than Ki-Hu129M/M mice. In contrast, Ki-Hu129V/V mice intraperitoneally inoculated with sCJD-MM1 prions showed no obvious PrP deposition in the spleen (0/9). Therefore, we confirmed that p-dCJD prions and sCJD-VV2 prions exhibited similar transmissibility to PrP-humanized mice even in peripheral infection. In addition, Ki-Hu129M/M mice intraperitoneally inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions produced MM[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres in the spleen (Fig. 4B). Meanwhile, Ki-Hu129V/V mice intraperitoneally inoculated with sCJD-VV2 prions produced VV[VV2]2 PrPres. Thus, we confirmed the shift of the PrPres size also in the spleens. Because cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions to Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice caused phenotypes similar to those of p-dCJD, we also examined the transmissibility of Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mouse-passaged sCJD-VV2 prions (designated as MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions). We performed intraperitoneal inoculation of the brain homogenate from a Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mouse that succumbed to sCJD-VV2 prions into PrP-humanized mice. All (11/11) of Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions showed PrP deposition in the spleen despite cross-sequence transmission. Western blot analysis of the spleens revealed that Ki-Hu129M/M mice produced type 2Sh+ PrPres (MM[MM[VV2]2Sh+]2Sh+ PrPres) identical in size to MM[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres. Meanwhile, Ki-Hu129V/V mice produced type 2 PrPres (VV[MM[VV2]2Sh+]2 PrPres) identical in size to VV[VV2]2 PrPres (Fig. 4B). Our data comprised of four major findings. First, transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions to Tg+Ki-Hu129M/M mice generated unusual PrPres (MM[VV2]2Sh+ PrPres) intermediate in size between type 1 and type 2. Second, the intermediate type MMi PrPres was seen in all examined p-dCJD cases. Third, Ki-Hu129V/V mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions showed short incubation times and the accumulation of type 2 PrPres with a downward size shift from the intermediate type template. Finally, Ki-Hu129V/V mice intraperitoneally inoculated with MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions showed high susceptibility and the accumulation of type 2 PrPres with a downward size shift from type 2Sh+ template. These findings suggest that p-dCJD could be caused by transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions to individuals with the 129M/M genotype (cross-sequence transmission). Our results clearly demonstrate that p-dCJD prions and np-dCJD prions are distinct strains. On careful examination, the intermediate type PrPres was found to be a common form in p-dCJD cases. Moreover, the characteristic features of p-dCJD including the intermediate type PrPres, the long incubation period, and plaque-type PrP deposits in the brain were maintained after transmission to PrP-humanized mice with 129M/M. Meanwhile, the humanized mice with 129M/M inoculated with np-dCJD prions showed type 1 PrPres, a short incubation period, and synaptic-type PrP deposits in the brain. These results demonstrate that p-dCJD and np-dCJD are distinct subtypes of d-CJD caused by distinct prion strains. The long incubation times of the mice inoculated with p-dCJD prions suggest the frightening possibility that the numbers of p-dCJD patients may increase in the future. sCJD cases with the 129M/V genotype and type 2 PrPSc (sCJD-MV2) and sCJD-VV2 cases account for 25% of the total sCJD cases and show the characteristic neuropathological changes highlighted by plaque-type PrP deposits (5Parchi P.

To date, some similarities among sCJD-MV2, sCJD-VV2, and p-dCJD have been described in clinicopathological, biochemical, and transmission studies (18Shimizu S. Hoshi K. Muramoto T. Homma M.

Although the results of the present study show that cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions can cause phenotypes similar to those of p-dCJD, further studies are needed to clarify whether sCJD-MV2 prions can cause a p-dCJD like phenotype in humanized mice with 129M/M. Besides p-dCJD, a few iatrogenic CJD cases with the 129M/M genotype and plaque-type PrP deposits in the brain have been reported in human growth hormone-related CJD (34Delisle M.B. Fabre N. Rochiccioli P. Doerr-Schott J. Rumeau J.L. Bes A. Rev. Neurol. (Paris). 1993; 149: 524-527PubMed Google Scholar, 35Billette de Villemeur T. Gelot A. Deslys J.P. Dormont D. Duyckaerts Ch. Jardin L.

The present results lead us to surmise that the human growth hormone-related CJD cases with 129M/M and plaque-type PrP deposits might be caused by the cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions. Through cross-sequence transmission, sCJD-VV2 prions acquired new conformational properties as reflected by the upward shift of the size of PrPres. A similar shift of the PrPres size through cross-sequence transmission has been reported in mice inoculated with vCJD prions (29Taguchi Y. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Muramoto T. Kitamoto T. Am. J.

Neuron. 2002; 34: 921-932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Moreover, the altered size of mouse-passaged Sc237 PrPres reverts to those of hamster-passaged Sc237 PrPres through transmission to hamsters (37Hill A.F. Joiner S. Linehan J. Desbruslais M. Lantos P.L. Collinge J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10248-10253Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, the intermediate type PrPres reverted to type 2 when MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions or p-dCJD prions were transmitted to the humanized mice with 129V/V in this study. The most plausible explanation for these findings is that adaptation to the new host PrPC and/or selection of a PrPSc subpopulation from the whole heterogeneous population result in the emergence of a new prion strain with altered conformational properties, and that the emerging prion strain retains the memory of the parental prions within its conformational properties and/or its PrPSc subpopulation. Therefore, if the emerging prion strain is transmitted to the original host, the parental prions may re-emerge and become dominant. The above concept is supported by the “traceback” phenomenon (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), e.g. knock-in mice and transgenic mice expressing bovine PrP are highly susceptible to vCJD prions as well as bovine spongiform encephalopathy prions (8Asano M. Mohri S. Ironside J.W. Ito M. Tamaoki N. Kitamoto T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 342: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 39Scott M.R. Peretz D. Nguyen H.O.B. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 5259-5271Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Consistent with a report using transgenic mice expressing human PrP with 129M or 129V (12Korth C. Kaneko K. Groth D. Heye N. Telling G. Mastrianni J. Parchi P. Gambetti P. Will R. Ironside J. Heinrich C. Tremblay P. DeArmond S.J. Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 4784-4789Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the humanized mice with 129V/V in our study were more susceptible to sCJD-VV2 prions than the humanized mice with 129M/M. Furthermore, the humanized mice with 129V/V showed high susceptibility to MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions and p-dCJD prions despite cross-sequence transmission. These phenomena can be explained as follows. Because MM[VV2]2Sh+ prions and p-dCJD prions retained the memory of the parental sCJD-VV2 prions, the humanized mice with 129V/V were highly susceptible to these prions as well as sCJD-VV2 prions. Our results demonstrate that traceback studies can be a powerful tool to identify the origin of prions. In this study, the strain-dependent traits of sCJD-MM1 prions were inherited through cross-sequence transmission without any modification. The humanized mice with 129V/V produced type 1 PrPres after inoculation with sCJD-MM1 prions. Because sCJD-VV1 cases are extremely rare (at most 1–2% of the total number of sCJD cases) and characterized by early onset (mean age at onset, 39.3 years) (5Parchi P. Giese A. Capellari S. Brown P. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Windl O. Zerr I. Budka H. Kopp N. Piccardo P. Poser S. Rojiani A. Streichemberger N. Julien J. Vital C. Ghetti B. Gambetti P. Kretzschmar H. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 224-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1220) Google Scholar), our results raise the possibility that CJD cases classified as VV1 may include cases caused by iatrogenic transmission of sCJD-MM1 prions or food-borne infection by type 1 prions from animals, e.g. chronic wasting disease prions in cervid. In fact, two CJD-VV1 patients who hunted deer or consumed venison have been reported (40Belay E.D. Gambetti P. Schonberger L.B. Parchi P. Lyon D.R. Capellari S. McQuiston J.H. Bradley K. Dowdle G.

Dis. 2004; 10: 977-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The results of the present study emphasize the need for traceback studies and careful re-examination of the biochemical properties of sCJD-VV1 prions. In conclusion, cross-sequence transmission of sCJD-VV2 prions generates a new prion strain with altered conformational properties and disease phenotypes as p-dCJD prions. Furthermore, the newly generated prions have unique transmissibility including the traceback phenomenon. In the future, if atypical prion strains emerge through cross-sequence transmission, especially from animals, traceback studies will enable us to identify the origin of the prions. We thank H.

https://openalex.org/W2000623061,"The histone acetyltransferase TIP60 regulates the DNA damage response following genotoxic stress by acetylating histone and remodeling chromatin. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the TIP60-dependent response to UV-induced DNA damage remain poorly understood. To systematically analyse proteins that regulate TIP60 activity in response to UV irradiation, we performed a proteomic analysis of proteins selectively bound to TIP60 in response to UV irradiation using mass spectrometry and identified a novel regulatory mechanism by which TIP60 orchestrates transcriptional activation of p53-dependent checkpoint response in UV-irradiated cells. The initial step of this pathway involves UV-induced association of TIP60 with SUMO-conjugation enzymes and site-specific sumoylation of TIP60 at lysines 430 and 451 via Ubc9. This sumoylation initiates the relocation of TIP60 from nucleoplasm to the promyelocytic leukemia body, which is essential for the UV-irradiated DNA damage repair response via a p53-dependent pathway. Significantly, inhibition of TIP60 sumoylation by overexpression of non-sumoylatable mutant abrogates the p53-dependent DNA damage response, demonstrating the importance of TIP60 sumoylation in response to UV irradiation. Our biochemical characterization demonstrated that the sumoylation of TIP60 augments its acetyltransferase activity in vitro and in vivo. Thus, this study shed new light on the function and regulation of TIP60 activity in UV-irradiated DNA damage response."
https://openalex.org/W2038947121,"The Y box-binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a DNA/RNA-binding protein that regulates mRNA transcription and translation. It is a major component of free messenger ribonucleoprotein particles and, at higher concentrations, blocks protein synthesis. In chicken embryo fibroblasts, overexpression of YB-1 confers a specific resistance to oncogenic cellular transformation by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) or Akt/PKB. Recent studies have identified YB-1 as a direct substrate of Akt. The functional significance of Akt-mediated phosphorylation remains largely unknown. We generated YB-1 mutants in the Akt phosphorylation consensus sequence to explore the effect of phosphorylated YB-1 in PI3K-induced transformation. In contrast to wild-type YB-1, the phosphomimetic S99E mutant no longer interferes with cellular transformation. This mutant has reduced affinity for the cap of mRNAs and fails to inhibit cap-dependent translation. The data suggest that phosphorylation by Akt disables the inhibitory activity of YB-1 and thereby enhances the translation of transcripts that are necessary for oncogenesis. Overexpression of wild-type YB-1 overrides inactivation by Akt and maintains inhibition of protein synthesis and resistance to transformation."

In normal skin, ADAM-9 expression was detected in both the epidermis and dermis and in vitro in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. Here we report that ADAM-9 functions as a cell adhesion molecule via its disintegrin-cysteine-rich domain.

This was corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation. In addition, engagement of integrin receptors by the disintegrin-cysteine-rich domain resulted in ERK phosphorylation and increased MMP-9 synthesis. Treatment with the ERK inhibitor PD98059 inhibited MMP-9 induction. Furthermore, the presence of the soluble disintegrin-cysteine-rich domain did not interfere with cell migration on different substrates. However, keratinocytes adhering to the immobilized disintegrin-cysteine-rich domain showed increased motility, which was partially due to the induction of MMP-9 secretion.

Degradation of the extracellular matrix is a prerequisite for tissue repair but also for cell migration and for release of bound factors and bioactive peptides. Different proteases have been implicated in these processes, such as the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), 2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH3, Src homology 3; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin.2The abbreviations used are: MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; ADAM, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase; EGF, epidermal growth factor; SH3, Src homology 3; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin. serine, cysteine, and aspartic protease families. In recent years, the family of proteases (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)) has drawn attention because the manifold proteolytic and adhesive activities of the different ADAM family members were attributed a pivotal role in physiological and pathological situations. The ADAM family includes ∼30 members of proteins containing disintegrin- and metalloprotease-like domains. Most of the family members share a common well conserved domain structure, including a prodomain, metalloprotease, disintegrinlike, cysteine-rich, EGF-like, and a short cytoplasmic domain (reviewed in Refs. 1Bergers G. Coussens L.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar and 2Schlondorff J. Blobel C.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3603-3617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, the ADAMs are most closely related to the P-III snake venom metalloproteases. However, in contrast to snake venom metalloproteases, most ADAMs possess EGF-like, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains. Half of the ADAM proteins are predicted to be active metalloproteinases, although the identification of specific substrates is still lacking for most of them. Various cell surface proteins are shed by ADAMs, such as IL-6 receptor, FAS-ligand, transforming growth factor-α, tumor necrosis factor-α, heparin-binding EGF, and L-selectin. The release of soluble forms of these proteins might lead to autocrine and distal paracrine effects that are usually restricted to a limited environment when cell surface-bound (1Bergers G. Coussens L.M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 120-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The cell-adhesive function of ADAM proteins has been attributed to the presence of both the disintegrin and cysteinerich domains. These domains are involved in binding to integrins, the heterodimeric cell surface receptors involved not only in the interactions of cells with the surrounding matrix but also with neighboring cells (3van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Most of the known ADAMs contain the integrin-binding amino acid sequence RGD (4Blobel C.P. White J.M.

Slocombe P.M. Stephens P.E. Warn A. Hutchinson G.R. Yamada K.M. Docherty A.J. Murphy G. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 579-587Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its activity seems to be mediated by the presence of an RGD motif in the disintegrin domain (10Zhang X.P. Kamata T. Yokoyama K. Puzon-McLaughlin W. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7345-7350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). However, recently, Takeda and co-workers (11Takeda S. Igarashi T. Mori H. Araki S. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 2388-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) solved the crystal structure of a snake venom metalloproteinase, a homologue of mammalian ADAMs, and excluded this motif from binding activities due to its inaccessibility for protein binding. Thodeti et al. (12Thodeti C.K. Albrechtsen R. Grauslund M. Asmar M. Larsson C. Takada Y. Mercurio A.M. Couchman J.R. Wewer U.M. J. Biol.

Recent studies suggest that the cytoplasmic domain of ADAMs may be involved in intracellular signaling leading to activation of proteolytic processes. The cytoplasmic domains of a significant number of ADAM proteins contain proline-rich SH3-ligand motifs and a consensus sequence for phosphorylation by protein kinase C that may transmit signals between the interior and exterior of the cells. In vitro binding assays have shown that ADAM-9 and ADAM-15 interact with two SH3-containing proteins, endophilin and SH3PX1, which may have a role in regulating the function of both proteases by influencing their intracellular processing, transport, and final localization (13Howard L. Nelson K.K. Maciewicz R.A. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31693-31699Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Similarly, PACSIN 2, another SH3-binding protein, was found to bind ADAM-13, thereby regulating its function during embryonic development (14Cousin H. Gaultier A. Bleux C. Darribere T. Alfandari D. Dev. Biol. 2000; 227: 197-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Further studies showed that protein kinase Cδ induces heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor shedding by binding to and phosphorylating the cytoplasmic domain of ADAM-9 (15Izumi Y. Hirata M. Hasuwa H. Iwamoto R. Umata T. Miyado K. Tamai Y. Kurisaki T. Sehara-Fujisawa A. Ohno S. Mekada E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7260-7272Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). ADAM-9 distribution is quite broad, and in human skin it is localized in epidermal keratinocytes, where it may be involved in the constitutive shedding of collagen XVII, thereby modulating migration of keratinocytes (16Franzke C.W. Tasanen K. Schacke H. Zhou Z. Tryggvason K. Mauch C. Zigrino P. Sunnarborg S. Lee D.C. Fahrenholz F. Bruckner-Tuderman L. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5026-5035Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). However, it is still unclear whether ADAM-9 may also be involved in cell-cell interactions once exposed on the cell surface and, if so, which cellular receptor would be involved in these interactions. Whether its function is primarily enzymatic or adhesive is not certain. In the present work, we have analyzed the cell-adhesive function of ADAM-9 in keratinocytes and the signals elicited by these interactions. Antibodies—For immunodetection analysis, goat polyclonal antibodies raised against human ADAM-9 were purchased from R&D Systems (Wiesbaden, Germany), and rabbit anti-filaggrin antibodies were from Covance (Biozol, Eching, Germany). Actin was detected using a mouse monoclonal antibody (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). Anti-His tag antibodies were from Qiagen (penta-His horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Detection of phosphorylated and unphosphorylated p38, ERK, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase proteins was performed using antibodies that specifically recognize the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany). The mouse anti-β1 integrin antibodies used for Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence were from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). The blocking monoclonal mouse antibody 4B4 directed against the human β1 integrin chain was obtained from Coulter Corp. (Hialeah, FL), whereas antibodies to the α integrin subunits were from Chemicon (Beta1 Integrin Partners Kit; Chemicon, Hofheim, Germany). Mouse anti-MMP-9 antibodies were from Calbiochem (Merck). Purified control IgG was purchased from Dako (Hamburg, Germany). Cells and Cell Culture—HaCaT cells were kindly provided by N. Fusenig (German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany). Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 100 units/ml each of penicillin and streptomycin. Human epidermal keratinocytes were isolated from adult skin as previously described (17Breitkreutz D. Schoop V.M. Mirancea N. Baur M. Stark H.J. Fusenig N.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Keratinocytes were cultured on collagen-coated dishes in FAD medium (DMEM/Ham's F-12 (3:1); Invitrogen) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10% fetal calf serum, 5 μg/ml insulin, 1 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10-10 mol/liter cholera toxin, and 24 ng/ml adenine. Epidermal-dermal split skin was prepared by thermolysin treatment of human skin specimens overnight at 4 °C (thermolysin bacillus type X, 1 mg/ml; Sigma). After washing twice with PBS, separated epidermis and dermis were directly processed for RNA preparation as described below. To obtain undifferentiated/differentiated HaCaT cells, the cells were cultured for 2 weeks in low calcium medium (0.05 mm) and switched to high calcium medium (1.8 mm) for 4 days. After incubation, lysates were prepared as described below. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA from human skin was prepared after fine mincing of the tissue using RNAzol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Wak-Chemie Medical GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). Reverse transcription-PCR was performed following the manufacturer's instructions (REDTaq™ ReadyMix™ PCR reaction mix; Sigma). Briefly, 1 μg of RNA was reverse transcribed using oligo(dT) as primer in a total volume of 25 μl. 5 μl of the cDNA was used to amplify specific transcripts by PCR. The following primers were used: for amplification of human ADAM-9, 5′-CCTCGGGGACCCTTCGTGT and 5′-ATCCCATAACTCGCATTCTCTAAA (18Boukamp P. Popp S. Bleuel K. Tomakidi E. Burkle A. Fusenig N.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); for murine ADAM-9, 5′-TCTGACCATCCCAACGTACA and 5′-GCTGTTGTGCAGAGGTTCAA; and for murine MMP-9, 5′AGTTTGGTGTCGCGGAGCAC and 5′ TACATGAGCGCTTCCGGCAC (19Sudbeck B.D. Pilcher B.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22103-22110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Amplification of S26 was used for normalization (20O'Shea C. McKie N. Buggy Y. Duggan C. Hill A.D. McDermott E. O'Higgins N. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). PCRs were performed on 1 μl of cDNA for 35 cycles (within the linear range of amplification): denaturation (94 °C, 1 min), annealing (60 °C, 1 min), and extension (72 °C, 1 min). The products were then analyzed on 2% agarose gels in TBE. Expression and Purification of the Disintegrin-Cysteine-rich Domain of ADAM-9—Total RNA from human dermal fibroblasts was used as template for reverse transcription. Reverse transcription followed by PCR was carried out using the primers 5′-ttttgctagctagtgctccctcctgtggt-3′ and 5′-ttttgcggccgcacagtcataattc-3′. The amplified DNA fragments were digested and cloned into the NheI/NotI-digested expression vector pCEP-pu BM40-cHis (21Kim M.H. Kitson R.P. Albertsson P. Nannmark U. Basse P.H. Kuppen P.J. Hokland M.E. Goldfarb R.H. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 5883-5889Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) This gave rise to a fusion protein with a His6 tag placed in frame with the disintegrin-cysteine-rich coding regions of ADAM-9. After transfection of this plasmid into 293-EBNA cells by FuGENE (ratio 3:1; Roche Applied Science), the cells were subsequently selected for puromycin resistance (0.5 μg/ml). Serum-free supernatants were tested for expression of the soluble disintegrin-cysteine rich domain (DC-9-his) by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide gel followed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for the His tag. For purification, supernatants were loaded on an immobilized metal affinity chromatographic column (Talon metal affinity resin; Clontech) with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. After washing with 5 column volumes of a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, and 2.5 mm imidazol, the proteins were eluted with 250 mm imidazol and dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C. Purified proteins were stored at -80 °C. Transient transfections of HaCaT cells were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) on 70% confluent cell monolayers. After 6 h, medium was replaced, and expression was analyzed after a further 48 h of culture. The full-length cDNA for ADAM-9 was kindly provided by C. Blobel (Hospital for Special Surgery, New York). Cell Adhesion Assays—Semiconfluent monolayer cultures of HaCaT cells or human primary keratinocytes were detached by incubation with 0.05% EDTA after three washes with 0.02% EDTA. The cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in Hepes buffer containing 0.5% BSA and 1 mm each of CaCl2 and MnCl2. Adhesion assays were performed as described before (22Zigrino P. Drescher C. Mauch C. Eur J. Cell Biol. 2001; 80: 68-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well tissue culture plates were coated with recombinant DC-9-his (20 μg/ml corresponding to ∼0.6 μm), His6 peptides (0.6 μm), bovine monomeric collagen type I (40 μg/ml), and human plasma fibronectin (30 μg/ml) at 4 °C overnight. BSA coating and blocking of nonspecific binding sites were performed with heat-denatured BSA (1% BSA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the wells twice, cells (2 × 104 cells/well) were seeded and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. For competition assays, antibodies (10 μg/ml) or peptides (0.6 μm) were added to the cell suspension before plating. Nonadherent cells were removed by washing twice with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 3% formaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.6, and stained with 0.5% crystal violet in 20% (v/v) methanol. The dye was released from the cells by the addition of 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% (v/v) ethanol. The optical density of the released dye solution was determined at 595 nm. Adhesion was either expressed directly as A595 nm or in percentage relative to untreated controls, which were set arbitrarily as 100%. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. Zymographic Analysis—Serum-free conditioned media were analyzed by gelatin zymography as previously described (20O'Shea C. McKie N. Buggy Y. Duggan C. Hill A.D. McDermott E. O'Higgins N. Duffy M.J. Int. J. Cancer. 2003; 105: 754-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To analyze whether MMP-9 is secreted as active or latent form of the enzyme, samples were activated with 1 mm 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate) in substrate buffer (see below) for 1 h at 37 °C and directly analyzed by gelatin zymography. Briefly, media were fractionated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (bovine; Sigma). After electrophoresis, the gels were washed in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min before overnight incubation in metalloproteinase substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2). Thereafter, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, and the bands corresponding to gelatinase activities appeared white against the blue background. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Lysates were prepared by washing twice the cells in PBS and directly scraping them off on ice in radio-immune precipitation buffer containing the protease inhibitors aprotinin (10 μg/ml), pefabloc (0.25 mg/ml), and leupeptin (1 μg/ml). For analysis of phosphorylated proteins sodium vanadate (50 mm) was additionally included. After overnight incubation at 4 °C, lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 × g and 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatant was collected and stored at -20 °C until use. Protein concentration was determined using a commercial assay (Micro-BCA; Perbio Science, Bonn, Germany). For immunoprecipitations, equal amounts of lysates were precleared for 2 h on protein-G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). After centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 10 min, precleared lysates were either applied to mouse IgG or mouse anti-human β1 integrin antibodies bound to protein-G-Sepharose (2 μg of antibodies preincubated for 2 h with protein-G-Sepharose at 4 °C) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After incubation, protein-G-Sepharose-bound proteins were washed three times with radio-immune precipitation buffer, and bound proteins were eluted in sample buffer containing 0.7 m β-mercaptoethanol. Eluted protein was further analyzed by Western blotting. For Western blotting, proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels under reducing conditions and transferred onto Hybond-C Super™ (Amersham Biosciences). After blockage of nonspecific binding sites with 5% skimmed milk (w/v) in PBS containing 0.5% Tween (v/v), for analysis of phosphorylated proteins, 5 mm sodium fluoride was included, and the blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. Bound primary antibodies were detected using a horse-radish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:2000; Dako, Hamburg, Germany) and visualized with the ECL™ system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Migration Assays—Cell migration assays were performed in 24-well tissue culture plates. Wells were coated with DC-9-his (20 μg/ml) and human plasma fibronectin (30 μg/ml) overnight at 4 °C. BSA blockage of nonspecific binding sites was performed by a 1-h incubation with heat-denatured BSA (1% BSA in Ca2+/Mg2+-free PBS) at room temperature. HaCaT cells were treated with mitomycin-C (1.6 μg/ml) for 2 h to arrest cell growth and then washed and detached with 0.05% EDTA. After washing twice with PBS, cells were resuspended in Hepes buffer containing 0.5% BSA and 1 mm of each CaCl2 and MnCl2. The cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in cloning rings (0.5-mm diameter) and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After removing the cloning rings and three washes with PBS to remove unbound cells, plates were placed on a microscope stage heated to 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. For inhibition experiments, cells were incubated, after washing, either in the presence of purified mouse IgG, used as control, or mouse anti-MMP-9 antibodies (10 μg/ml). Images were collected every hour for 48 h. Areas covered by cells at these time points were calculated using R^ software (Olympus Biosystems, Munich, Germany). Immunolocalization—To detect proteins in monolayer cultures, cells were cultured on tissue culture slides for 48 h and then fixed for 10 min with cold acetone. Stainings were performed, incubating the cell monolayers or tissue with the first antibodies described under “Antibodies” for 16 h at 4 °C in PBS containing 2% BSA and 0.05% Tween. After extensive washes, primary bound antibodies were detected using donkey anti-goat 594, goat anti-rabbit 594, and, for the colocalization studies, rabbit anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate (all diluted in PBS with BSA/Tween) for 1 h at room temperature. Nuclei were counterstained with 1 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Roche Applied Science). Negative controls were performed using control IgG as primary antibodies. For colocalization studies, fluorescence images were recorded using a Zeiss (Thornwood, NY) Axiovert M-200 inverted epifluorescence microscope with Apotome slider confocal attachment. Images captured at ×630 magnification were analyzed using the three-dimensional analysis imaging software of the Axiovision LE Rel. 4.5 and Adobe Photoshop version 7.0. Expression of ADAM-9 in Human Skin—Analysis of protein expression by immunofluorescence showed ADAM-9 expression throughout the whole epidermis with a stronger staining in all suprabasal layers when compared with the basal layer. Expression was also observed in spindle-shaped cells (indicated by white arrows; Fig. 1a). To assess ADAM-9 mRNA expression in human skin, we performed reverse transcription-PCR analysis of RNA preparations from thermolysin-dissociated epidermis and dermis and from total skin (Fig. 1b). ADAM-9 transcripts were detected in both epidermis and dermis with a significantly higher expression in the epidermis. In agreement with the described expression pattern, specific ADAM-9 transcripts were detected by Northern blot analysis of total RNA preparations in cultured keratinocytes, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts but not in melanocytes (data not shown). To confirm the protein expression pattern observed in the epidermis, we analyzed cellular extracts from undifferentiated (low Ca2+) or differentiated (switched to high Ca2+) HaCaT cells. The HaCaT cells are spontaneously immortalized keratinocytes, which closely resemble normal keratinocytes in their growth and differentiation characteristics. This has made the HaCaT cell line a widely used model of normal human keratinocytes (17Breitkreutz D. Schoop V.M. Mirancea N. Baur M. Stark H.J. Fusenig N.E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 273-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 18Boukamp P. Popp S. Bleuel K. Tomakidi E. Burkle A. Fusenig N.E. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5638-5645Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Cells undergoing differentiation, as indicated by the expression of the late differentiation marker filaggrin (25Breitkreutz D. Stark H.J. Plein P. Baur M. Fusenig N.E. Differentiation. 1993; 54: 201-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), produced increased amounts of ADAM-9 protein. Both pro (115 kDa) and active forms (80 kDa) of ADAM-9 were detected by Western blot analysis of total cell lysates (Fig. 1c). By immunofluorescence staining of monolayer cultures, an increase in ADAM-9 expression was observed upon differentiation and paralleled the enhanced in filaggrin staining induced by the culture conditions (Fig. 1d). These data corroborate the expression pattern observed in human skin (Fig. 1a). Recombinant Production of the Disintegrin-Cysteine-rich Domain of ADAM-9 and Analysis of Its Interaction with Epidermal Cells—The proteolytic functions of ADAM-9 have been analyzed in several studies (26Weskamp G. Cai H. Brodie T.A. Higashyama S. Manova K. Ludwig T. Blobel C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1537-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E.

However, its binding activity and putative functional role as an adhesive cell receptor in human skin has not been investigated. Therefore, to elucidate whether ADAM-9 possesses an adhesive function on keratinocytes and to identify ADAM-9 ligands, we produced a recombinant protein consisting of the disintegrin-like cysteine-rich domain of ADAM-9 fused to a His6 tag in a eukaryotic expression system. The protein was purified from serum-free supernatants of stably transfected 293-EBNA cells using immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The purified recombinant disintegrin-like cysteine-rich His-tagged domain of ADAM-9 (DC-9-his) was secreted as a 35-kDa protein as shown by SDS-PAGE and subsequent Coomassie staining and by immunoblotting with anti-His antibodies (Fig. 2). The identity of the protein was further confirmed by peptide mass fingerprint analysis of tryptic fragments of the recombinant protein (data not shown); the lower band was identified as a smaller degradation product of the disintegrincysteine-rich domain. To examine whether the recombinant DC-9-his could support cell adhesion of human keratinocytes, we performed cell adhesion assays with immobilized recombinant protein. HaCaT cells specifically adhered to the DC-9-his domain but very poorly to histidine peptides and BSA used as negative controls (Fig. 3A). The adhesion observed to DC-9-his was 60% of that measured on fibronectin and 35% of that measured on collagen type I, both used as positive controls. At low coating concentrations of DC-9-his, cells appeared rounded and displayed small filopodia projecting out of the cells. With increasing coating concentrations, HaCaT spread on the immobilized ligand (Fig. 3B). An adhesion pattern comparable with that of DC-9-his was observed using human primary keratinocytes (data not shown). Interaction of Epidermal Cells with the Recombinant Disintegrin-Cysteine-rich Domain Requires β1 Integrin Receptors—To identify the integrin subunits potentially responsible for cell adhesion to DC-9-his, inhibitory anti-integrin antibodies were used to analyze inhibition of keratinocyte adhesion to the DC-9-his protein. Antibodies directed against the β1 but not the β3 integrin subunit efficiently inhibited adhesion by 60% (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, antibodies against the α3 subunit reduced adhesion by 70%, whereas inhibitory antibodies directed against the α2, α5, and α6 subunits had no significant effect when compared with the IgG control antibodies. Interaction of integrin receptors or disintegrins with their substrates is mediated by RGD-containing amino acid sequences. In the case of ADAMs that do not contain such a motif (e.g. ADAM-9), the ECD sequence takes over the activity of the RGD amino acid sequence (28White J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2003; 15: 598-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Both RGD and ECD cyclic peptides as well as their respective control peptides containing the RAD and ECD motifs did not inhibit adhesion to immobilized DC-9-his (Fig. 4A). The association of the endogenous β1 integrin receptor subunit with ADAM-9 protein was further corroborated by co-immunoprecipitation studies. Immunoprecipitation of β1 integrin from HaCaT cell lysates led to co-precipitation of ADAM-9, thus suggesting a direct interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 4B). This observation was further substantiated by immunolocalization of ADAM-9 and β1 integrin in cell monolayers, where both proteins co-localized at sites of cell-cell contacts, as indicated by the white arrow and shown in the detail of the optical sectio"
https://openalex.org/W2022867396,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Tid1 protein is important for the recombinational repair of double-stranded DNA breaks during meiosis. Tid1 is a member of Swi2/Snf2 family of chromatin remodeling proteins and shares homology with Rad54. Members of this family hydrolyze ATP and promote 1) chromatin remodeling, 2) DNA topology alterations, and 3) displacement of proteins from DNA. All of these activities are presumed to require translocation of the protein on DNA. Here we use single-molecule visualization to provide direct evidence for the ability of Tid1 to translocate on DNA. Tid1 translocation is ATP-dependent, and the velocities are broadly distributed, with the average being 84 ± 39 base pairs/s. Translocation is processive, with the average molecule traveling ∼10,000 base pairs before pausing or dissociating. Many molecules display simple monotonic unidirectional translocation, but the majority display complex translocation behavior comprising intermittent pauses, direction reversals, and velocity changes. Finally, we demonstrate that translocation by Tid1 on DNA can result in disruption of three-stranded DNA structures. The ability of Tid1 translocation to clear DNA of proteins and to migrate recombination intermediates may be of critical importance for DNA repair and chromosome dynamics.

The TID1 (two-hybrid interacting with Dmc1) (1Dresser M.E. Ewing D.J. Conrad M.N. Dominguez A.M. Barstead R. Jiang H. Kodadek T. Genetics. 1997; 147: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) gene product, also known as RDH54 (Rad homolog 54), is required for mitotic as well as meiotic recombination (2Klein H.L.

Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, Tid1 plays a much more important role during meiotic recombination, since tid1 mutants exhibit poor sporulation and reduction in spore viability (2Klein H.L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Meiotic recombination is initiated by the infliction of programmed “cuts” in the chromosome (4Cao L. Alani E. Kleckner N. Cell. 1990; 61: 1089-1101Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar, 5Sun H. Treco D. Schultes N.P. Szostak J.W. Nature. 1989; 338: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These dsDNA breaks are processed to generate 3′-tailed single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), upon which a class of proteins called DNA strand exchange proteins assemble to form nucleoprotein filaments (6Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). These nucleoprotein filaments represent the active species during recombination and have the ability to scan DNA molecules in trans, locate a region of DNA sequence homology, and mediate DNA pairing. This reaction is called DNA strand invasion (6Kowalczykowski S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 156-165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and is mediated by Dmc1 and Rad51 (7Masson J.Y. West S.C. Trends Biochem.

The process of template-directed DNA repair involves many additional proteins. One class of such proteins is the DNA translocases, motor proteins that can translocate on duplex DNA and remove impediments. Meiotic yeast cells possess two homologous DNA translocases that are involved in recombination: Tid1 and Rad54 (3Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is speculated that Tid1 primarily cooperates with Dmc1 to promote interhomolog DNA strand exchange, whereas Rad54 would function with Rad51 to promote intersister DNA strand exchange (3Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H. Ogawa H. Shinohara A. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1545-1556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Because DNA synthesis is needed to replicate the information that is lost during the processing of the DNA ends, the activity of DNA translocases may play a crucial role in clearing the DNA strand exchange proteins from the newly formed DNA heteroduplex, thereby making the 3′-end of the invading ssDNA accessible to the polymerase (12Solinger J.A. Kiianitsa K. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1175-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rad54 will also stimulate the branch migration of this 3-stranded pairing intermediate (13Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8447-8453Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 14Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, capture of the second end of the dsDNA break (15Sugiyama T. Kantake N. Wu Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5539-5548Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), followed by branch migration generates a pair of Holliday junctions. The Holliday junction is a symmetric four-way DNA structure that can undergo branch migration, and recently, Rad54 was shown to promote such migration, a process that increases or decreases the extent of DNA heteroduplex (16Bugreev D.V. Mazina O.M. Mazin A.V. Nature. 2006; 442: 590-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Thus, it is evident that dsDNA translocases are multifaceted proteins playing important roles during both early and late steps of homologous recombination. Tid1 and Rad54 belong to the Swi2/Snf2 family of chromatin-remodeling proteins (17Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Members of this family were inferred to be ATP-dependent duplex DNA translocases, and recent single molecule observations have provided the most direct evidence for translocation (18Lia G. Praly E.

Rad54 performs a wide variety of functions potentially important to recombinational DNA repair: alteration of DNA topology (10Petukhova G. Van Komen S. Vergano S. Klein H. Sung P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29453-29462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), displacement of Rad51 from dsDNA (21Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Nature. 1998; 393: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) and chromatin (24Alexiadis V. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2767-2771Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 25Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and catalysis of nucleosome sliding on DNA (26Alexeev A. Mazin A. Kowalczykowski S.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 182-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Each of these activities is presumably a consequence of the ability of the protein to actively translocate on dsDNA. Notably, because Rad54 translocates on dsDNA and not on ssDNA, as is the case for DNA helicases (27Singleton M.R. Wigley D.B. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1819-1826Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), it does not separate dsDNA into its component DNA strands. Given the fact that Tid1 is a structural (37% amino acid sequence similarity) and functional relative of Rad54 (1Dresser M.E. Ewing D.J. Conrad M.N. Dominguez A.M. Barstead R. Jiang H. Kodadek T. Genetics. 1997; 147: 533-544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Klein H.L. Genetics. 1997; 147: 1533-1543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Shinohara M. Shita-Yamaguchi E. Buerstedde J.M. Shinagawa H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar), it might be expected to possess similar functional characteristics. Indeed, Tid1 demonstrates strong ATPase activity and can alter DNA topology (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). To determine whether Tid1 can translocate on DNA as well, we visualized individual Tid1 molecules on single DNA molecules. Here we show that Tid1, like its homolog Rad54, can translocate on dsDNA in an ATP-dependent manner (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our observations are in agreement with and complement those in a recent study that appeared while our manuscript was in preparation (28Prasad T.K. Robertson R.B. Visnapuu M.L. Chi P. Sung P. Greene E.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 940-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In addition, our study shows that Tid1 can “unwind” three-stranded DNA structures by virtue of its ability to translocate on DNA, thereby establishing that Tid1 can act on intermediates of recombination. Our finding is consistent with the reported ability of Rad54 to disrupt triple helical structures (25Jaskelioff M. Van Komen S. Krebs J.E. Sung P. Peterson C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9212-9218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The single molecule detection of movement reported here permits quantification of translocation, as well as visualization of complex behavior, that cannot be uncovered by ensemble measurements. The similarity of translocation behavior exhibited by Tid1 and Rad54 suggests that each performs a similar biological function but that functional differentiation arises from the specific interaction with the respective DNA strand exchange protein, Dmc1 or Rad51. Cloning and Purification of GST-Tid1—The full-length TID1 gene was cloned into an expression vector (pWDH597; kind gift from Dr. W.-D. Heyer, University of California, Davis), such that it was in frame and downstream of a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag. The recombinant protein is therefore 130.6 kDa (26.5-kDa GST and 104.1-kDa Tid1). The expression construct was designed in a way that introduces a thrombin cleavage site between GST and Tid1 (14Solinger J.A. Lutz G. Sugiyama T. Kowalczykowski S.C. Heyer W.D. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 307: 1207-1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The recombinant protein was expressed in yeast; we recovered ∼2 mg of protein starting from 20 g of cells. The GST-Tid1 fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using a two-column purification scheme similar to the one employed to purify Rad54 (29Kiianitsa K. Solinger J.A. Heyer W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46205-46215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purity of the protein was estimated to be >95%, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The concentration of the protein was determined spectrophotometrically using an extinction coefficient of 106,800 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. The purified fusion protein is a dsDNA-dependent ATPase, with Vmax and Km 3A. V. Nimonkar and S. C. Kowalczykowski, manuscript in preparation. comparable with published values (11Petukhova G. Sung P. Klein H. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2206-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The kcat values of Tid1 with and without tag were identical, 4A. V. Nimonkar and S. C. Kowalczykowski, unpublished observations. indicating that the tag does not interfere with Tid1 biochemical function. The details of purification and biochemical characterization of GST-Tid1 will be published elsewhere. 3A. V. Nimonkar and S. C. Kowalczykowski, manuscript in preparation. Proteins and Nucleic Acids—RecA was purified as described (30Mirshad J.K. Kowalczykowski S.C. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5937-5944Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase and AatII were purchased from New England Biolabs. Proteinase K was purchased from Roche Applied Science. A 100-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide, complementary to nucleotides 2451–2550 of the minus strand of pUC19, was purchased from Sigma Genosys and gel-purified on a 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The 100-mer was 5′-32P-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP (4,500 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and purified using MicroSpin G-25 columns (GE Healthcare). Supercoiled pUC19 DNA was purified by nonalkaline lysis followed by CsCl2 density gradient centrifugation (31Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., and Maniatis, T. (1989) Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., pp. 1.42-1.45, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar). DNA concentrations of the 100-mer and pUC19 (2,686 bp) are expressed in moles of nucleotides (nt) as well as molecules, using molar extinction coefficients at 260 nm of 9.98 × 103 and 6.6 × 103 m-1 cm-1, respectively. Preparation of Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC)-Tid1-DNA-Bead Complexes—The DNA-bead complexes were made as described (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the FITC-Tid1-DNA-bead complex was assembled by mixing 10 nm Tid1 with 25 pm DNA-bead complex, followed by the addition of 670 nm anti-GST antibody, labeled with FITC (Immunology Consultants Laboratory; average labeling ∼6 fluorophores/antibody) in phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 10 min and transferred to 400 μl of a degassed solution containing 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, and 15% sucrose. The binding of the antibody to Tid1 (hereafter referred to as FITC-Tid1) reduces the dsDNA-dependent ATPase activity by ∼40–60% and correlated with a reduction in the amount of FITC-Tid1 capable of binding to dsDNA as measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (data not shown); we conclude that the antibody prevents these Tid1 molecules from binding to the DNA. Since we select for only DNA-bound Tid1 complexes, the inhibitory effect of the antibody does not influence our single molecule analysis. Single Molecule Tid1 Translocation Assay—The FITC-Tid1-DNA-bead complex was introduced into the first channel of a multichannel flow cell. The flow cell was held on a temperature-controlled motorized sample stage, mounted on an inverted microscope (Nikon TE2000U). The FITC-labeled Tid1-DNA-bead complex was excited with an argon laser (Spectra-Physics 161C-030; 488 nm) using the appropriate filter set and imaged with an EB-CCD camera (C7190-23; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan). The images were recorded on S-VHS tape. Translocation of Tid1 along dsDNA was initiated by moving the trapped FITC-Tid1-DNA-bead complex to the second channel of the flow cell containing a degassed solution of 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.2, 30 mm dithiothreitol, 15% sucrose, 2 mm magnesium acetate, and 1 mm ATP. The linear flow rate at the trap position was 120 μm/s. Data Analysis—Data analysis was performed largely as described (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the following exceptions. Images were digitized using a frame grabber controlled by ImageJ (version 1.345). The position of the FITC-Tid1 complex was determined by fitting the fluorescent intensity distribution to a two-dimensional Gaussian function, f(x,y)=A×exp(−(x−xc)2Sx2−(y−yc)2Sy2)+B(Eq. 1) The length of the λ DNA was measured under identical conditions by using DNA that was end-labeled with a fluorescent tag; the tag comprised a chemically synthesized oligonucleotide (Operon) containing digoxigenin that was ligated to the end of λ DNA opposite the bead attachment end, to which sheep anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche Applied Science) was bound and to which Cy3-labeled anti-sheep IgG (Chemicon) was bound. The position of the end label was determined as above, and the distance (i.e. length) to the bead in the optical trap (whose position was determined by visual inspection) was obtained. For the FITC-Tid1 translocation measurements, the distance, D, between the bead and FITC-Tid1 was calculated using Equation 2. D=(xTid1−xbead)2+(yTid1−ybead)2(Eq. 2) Generation of Three-stranded DNA Structures—Displacement loops (D-loops) were formed using RecA as follows: 5′-32P 100-mer (0.9 μm nt; 9 nm molecules) was preincubated with RecA (0.3 μm) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate, (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATPγS, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was supplemented with pUC19 Form I DNA (48 μm nt; 9 nm molecules) and further incubated for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was deproteinized using the Promega Wizard DNA clean-up system, followed by removal of excess unreacted oligonucleotide by gel filtration through a Chroma Spin + TE-1000 column (BD Biosciences). To determine the yield of D-loop formation, a fraction of the RecA-catalyzed D-loop reaction was analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel (4.5 V/cm for ∼1 h). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried on DE81 paper (Whatman), analyzed, and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare); the yield of D-loops was ∼35–40%. The DNA concentration was ∼15 μm nt (∼3 nm molecules). Linear joint molecules were formed by mixing AatII-linearized pUC19 (0.9 μm nt; 9 nm molecules) with 5′-32P 100-mer (48 μm nt; 9 nm molecules) in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl. AatII cuts pUC19 at residue 2617. The reaction mixture was heated to 95 °C for 5 min and gradually cooled to room temperature to allow formation of linear joint molecules (5–6 h). Since the 100-mer is complementary to residues 2451–2550, annealing of the 100-mer to AatII-linearized pUC19 would generate a three-stranded flapped structure at the end (see schematic diagram in Fig. 6D). The free 100-mer was removed by gel filtration through a Chroma Spin + TE-1000 column. The yield was ∼35–40% and was determined as described for D-loop formation. The DNA concentration was ∼10 μm nt (∼2 nm molecules). Dissociation of D-loops and Linear Joint Molecules by Tid1—Dissociation reactions with joint molecules and Tid1 were performed in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris acetate (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm ATP, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of termination buffer (final concentration: 2% SDS, 3 μg/μl proteinase K, 50 mm EDTA; incubation time 20 min). Reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in 0.8% agarose gel (4.5 V/cm for ∼1 h). Following electrophoresis, the gels were dried on DE81 paper (Whatman), analyzed, and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 860 PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Tid1 Translocates on dsDNA—To visualize translocation of Tid1 on DNA, we adopted the strategy used previously for Rad54 (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This involved purification of a functional protein fusion of GST and Tid1. The N-terminal GST tag provides an excellent tool to visualize the protein using an anti-GST antibody to which fluorescent dye is conjugated. Consequently, anti-GST antibody, labeled with FITC, was used to visualize GST-Tid1 (hereafter referred to as FITC-Tid1). The FITC-Tid1 complex was subsequently used to image translocation on individual DNA molecules. The instrumentation, consisting of an epifluorescence microscope, an optical trap, and a multichannel flow cell, was essentially as described previously (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 32Bianco P.R. Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Yeh Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. Baskin R.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bacteriophage λ DNA molecule was biotinylated at one end and attached to a 1-μm streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead (Fig. 1A). The DNA-bead complex was incubated with FITC-Tid1 in the absence of ATP to allow binding to DNA but not translocation. The bound FITC-Tid1-DNA-bead complex was introduced in the first channel of a two-channel flow cell. The laminar flow in the multichannel flow cell maintains a boundary between the channels, which limits mixing of solutions. The enzyme-bead-DNA complex was captured by a laser trap in the first channel, thereby tethering one end of the DNA molecule. The trapped DNA molecule was subsequently moved to the second channel of the flow cell, which contained ATP. Introduction of FITC-Tid1 into the ATP solution initiates translocation on the DNA tethered to the bead. Because the second flow channel lacked free protein as well as antibody, additional binding or rebinding cannot occur, and background fluorescence from free FITC-Tid1 is nonexistent. The FITC-Tid1 complex on DNA was imaged using a CCD camera attached to the fluorescence microscope and recorded on analog video tape. In the current instrument, flow is from right to left. Movement of the FITC-Tid1 toward the bead (opposite to the direction of flow) is called “upstream,” whereas movement away from the bead (in the direction of flow) is called “downstream.” We observed that translation of the FITC-Tid1-DNA-bead complex into the ATP-containing channel initiated translocation of the FITC-Tid1 along the dsDNA (Fig. 1A). Individual frames from two different videos show, in one case, a fluorescent FITC-Tid1 complex moving downstream (left side) away from the bead in the optical trap (which is also fluorescent due to nonspecific binding of the FITC-antibody to the bead) (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and a second example moving in the upstream direction (right side) toward the bead. The DNA molecule is invisible, because it is not labeled. The intensity of FITC-Tid1 is seen to decrease over time due to photobleaching of the fluorescent dye molecules. Translocation of the FITC-Tid1 is readily displayed by stacking video image “slices,” each containing an image segment through only the bead and moving protein, for successive video frames to produce a kymograph. Fig. 1B shows the lateral position of the FITC-Tid1 as a function of time, clearly demonstrating downstream (left) as well as upstream (right) movement on λ DNA. To determine the velocity of translocation as well as the distance traveled by the translocating complex, its position relative to the trapped bead was plotted as a function of time (Fig. 1C). In the case of the downstream translocating complex (left), the FITC-Tid1 complex initially bound approximately in the middle of the λ DNA at 23,000 ± 200 bp and then translocated downstream monotonically for almost 21 kbp to the end of the DNA molecule. The velocity of translocation was 117 ± 0.1 bp/s. For the example of the FITC-Tid1 that moved upstream along the DNA (Fig. 1, A and B, right panels), this molecule initially bound to the DNA at about 35,000 ± 150 bp from the bead (Fig. 1C, right). It translocated upstream monotonically at a rate of 66 ± 0.4 bp/s, for a distance of about 25 kbp. Although the downstream translocation by FITC-Tid1 can be explained by flow-induced movement, the upstream translocation cannot; however, as will be established below, translocation is ATP-dependent and of comparable magnitude in either direction. Thus, Tid1 clearly has the capacity to translocate on dsDNA. Tid1 Exhibits a Lower Translocation Velocity and Processivity than Rad54—For the collection of molecules visualized (n = 21), we observed that 40% of the FITC-Tid1 moved initially in the upstream direction, and the remainder moved in the downstream direction (Table 1). Furthermore, although many showed the simple behavior displayed in Fig. 1, most molecules showed a change in velocity during translocation, which is discussed below. A histogram of all translocation velocity segments (40 segments in total for the 21 molecules) shows an approximately Gaussian distribution (Fig. 2A); a similar distribution is obtained when only the initial velocity segments (n = 21) are used (data not shown). The distribution may be bimodal, but the small sample size prevents us from making an unequivocal statement about the nature of the distribution. Fitting the data to a single Gaussian (red line) yields a mean velocity of 84 ± 39 bp/s, whereas fitting the data to a bimodal Gaussian yields two peaks with mean velocities of 73 ± 43 and 144 ± 51 bp/s; although interesting, it is unclear whether the 2-fold difference in mean velocities is meaningful. Regardless of the nature of the distribution, there was no experimentally significant bias in the velocity distribution for molecules that moved upstream versus those that moved downstream (a difference of ∼15 bp/s; data not shown), as was also the case for Rad54 (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These mean values are ∼2–4-fold lower than the translocation velocity of Rad54 (302 ± 22 bp/s), which was determined using the same technique. As for Rad54 (20Amitani I. Baskin R.J. Kowalczykowski S.C. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 143-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (and RecBCD (32Bianco P.R. Brewer L.R. Corzett M. Balhorn R. Yeh Y. Kowalczykowski S.C. Baskin R.J. Nature. 2001; 409: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar)), the Tid1 translocation velocities were seen to vary as much as 10-fold between the fastest and the slowest molecule due to an as yet undefined intrinsic molecular heterogeneity.TABLE 1Distribution of Tid1 translocation characteristics The behaviors of the FITC-Tid1 translocation complexes are expressed as percentages. A total of 21 translocating complexes were analyzed. The actual distributions are as follows: seven of 21 showed simple translocation, of which four showed downstream and three showed upstream translocation; 14 of 21 showed complex translocation, of which four demonstrated intermittent pausing, five showed translocation reversals, and all 14 exhibited multiple velocities.

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we have developed an in vitro system to examine the activity of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A with TRAF6 in which TRAF6 serves as both a ubiquitin ligase and substrate for modification. Although TRAF6 potently stimulates the activity of UBC13-UEV1A to synthesize ubiquitin chains, it is not appreciably ubiquitinated. We have determined that the presentation of Lys63 of ubiquitin by UEV1A suppresses TRAF6 modification. Based on our observations, we propose that the modification of proteins with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains occurs through a UEV1A-independent substrate modification and UEV1A-dependent Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain synthesis mechanism.

The post-translational modification of proteins through the covalent addition of the 76-amino acid protein ubiquitin has emerged as a critical mechanism for regulating many aspects of cellular physiology (1Pickart C.M. Fushman D. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2004; 8: 610-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar). The role of ubiquitin in modulating protein activity is defined in part by the extent and type of modification. Single ubiquitin molecule attachments (mono-ubiquitination) as well as chains of ubiquitin molecules generated through isopeptide linkages between the primary amine of a lysine side chain of one molecule and the C terminus of another encode signals that are deciphered to trigger distinct cellular responses. Chains of specific ubiquitin-ubiquitin linkages result in distinct protein fates. For example, a lysine 48-linked chain of at least four ubiquitin molecules is the minimum signal for efficient degradation of a protein by the 26 S proteasome in vitro (2Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests, in contrast, that Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains attached onto a protein serve in non-proteolytic functions such as regulating intracellular signaling (3Chen Z.J. Nat.

Perhaps the most well understood mechanism for generating specific ubiquitin linkages is through the activity of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) 2The abbreviations used are: E2, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid; NEM, N-ethylmaleimide; Ub, ubiquitin. UBC13. UBC13 functions as a heterodimer by binding through a large hydrophobic interface with the UEV (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme variant) family of which MMS2 and UEV1A are representative members (4Hofmann R.M.

UEVs contain the conserved enzymatic core of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, but lack a catalytic cysteine. By binding a ubiquitin molecule and positioning its Lys63 near the active site cysteine of UBC13, UEVs promote Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain synthesis (8VanDemark A.P. Hofmann R.M. Tsui C.

To study this process, we have focused on reconstituting the modification of TRAF6 by UBC13-UEV1A in vitro with purified proteins. TRAF6 functions downstream of specific members of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family and upon receptor stimulation promotes NF-κB activation (13Cao Z. Xiong J. Takeuchi M. Kurama T. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 443-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar, 14Ishida T. Mizushima S. Azuma S. Kobayashi N. Tojo T. Suzuki K. Aizawa S. Watanabe T. Mosialos G. Kieff E.

Fractionation experiments initially identified UBC13 as a TRAF6 interacting protein and a variety of cell-based and in vitro experiments suggest that TRAF6 modification with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains has a non-proteolytic function in NF-κB activation through the kinase TAK1 (15Deng L.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 566: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this case, TRAF6 appears to function both as a ubiquitin ligase (it contains a RING motif and interacts with its ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme UBC13-UEV1A) and substrate for its own modification (it is subjected to “auto-ubiquitination”). Here, we examine how UBC13-UEV1A functions with this ubiquitin ligase to promote TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination and uncover that the activity provided by UEV1A primarily promotes Lys63-linked ubiquitin chain synthesis that effectively reduces TRAF6 modification. Based on these observations, we propose a model for how substrate modification with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains occurs through the activity of this ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme. Ubiquitin-activating Enzyme (E1)—Human E1 containing an N-terminal hexahistidine tag was expressed in Sf9 insect cells from recombinant baculovirus and purified from lysates by Ni-NTA chromatography, followed by Mono Q-Sepharose separation. Fractions containing E1 were pooled and dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, and 10% glycerol. UBC13-UEV1A and UbcH5c—The subunits of human UBC13-UEV1A were expressed individually as hexahistidine-tagged proteins in Escherichia coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. UBC13 contains an N-terminal hexahistidine tag and UEV1A contains a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. For experiments using the intact complex, both proteins were initially mixed together at equal concentrations. See Fig. 1A for a Coomassie-stained gel of purified UBC13 (lane 3) and UEV1A (lane 4). UbcH5c was also expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography via an N-terminal hexahistidine tag. Protein concentration was measured using a commercial protein concentration kit (Bio-Rad Protein Assay) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard as per the manufacturer's instructions and verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. To compare the relative amount of active UBC13 and UbcH5c in these preparations, we examined the ability of these enzymes (5 μm) to be charged with 40 μm ubiquitin by 150 nm E1 in the presence of 1 mm ATP. At the indicated times, reaction aliquots were removed and added to non-reducing sample buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (Fig. 4C).FIGURE 4UBC13-UEV1A predominantly synthesizes ubiquitin chains in the presence of TRAF6.A, ubiquitin incorporation; and B, TRAF6 modification were analyzed in reactions containing UBC13-UEV1A (lanes 1–6), UbcH5c (lanes 7–12), and UBC13 (lanes 13–18) at the time points shown. Reaction aliquots were removed at the indicated times and added to an equal volume of reducing sample buffer prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti TRAF6 and anti-ubiquitin antisera. The bottom panels in B are longer exposures of the top panels. The relative positions of ubiquitin (Ub), ubiquitin chains, TRAF6, and ubiquitinated TRAF6 (TRAF6-Ubn) are indicated. C, the ability of UBC13 (5 μm, lanes 1–6) and UbcH5c (5 μm, lanes 7–12) to be charged with ubiquitin (12.5 μm) was assessed in the presence of 150 nm E1 and 1 mm ATP. Reaction aliquots were removed at the indicated times and analyzed under non-reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining. The relative positions of free ubiquitin, unmodified UbcH5c (UbcH5c), unmodified UBC13 (UBC13), UbcH5c charged with ubiquitin (UbcH5c-Ub), UBC13 charged with ubiquitin (UBC13-Ub) and E1 are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TRAF6—The mouse TRAF6 open reading frame (amino acid sequence is >80% identical to human TRAF6) was cloned into pFastBac1 containing sequences encoding N-terminal streptavidin-binding peptide and calmodulin-binding peptide. High titer stocks of recombinant baculovirus were generated as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). For TRAF6 expression, Sf9 cells (107 cells/10 cm2 plate) were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for ∼42 h. Lysates (1 ml of lysis buffer/10-cm2 plate) were prepared in Lysis Buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Clarified lysates were added to streptavidin-agarose (1 ml of lysate to 50 μl of streptavidin-agarose) and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C with mixing. After washing 4 times with Lysis Buffer and twice with Lysis Buffer without Triton X-100, bound material was eluted three times with 2 bead volumes of Lysis Buffer without Triton X-100 containing 2.5 mm d-desthiobiotin. Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent using γ-globulin as a standard and purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining (see Fig. 1A, lane 5). Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin Derivatives—Ubiquitin, K0 ubiquitin, Lys63 only ubiquitin, and K63R ubiquitin were purchased from Boston Biochem and resuspended in water. Ubiquitin stocks were prepared at 25 mg/ml and the various ubiquitin derivatives were prepared at 5 mg/ml. FLAG-ubiquitin (ubiquitin containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope) was expressed in E. coli and purified by acid elution from anti-FLAG-Sepharose. Eluted material was dialyzed into 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 25 °C, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine, and 10% glycerol. Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent as per the manufacturer's instructions and verified by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Reactions were performed in ubiquitination reaction buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The indicated proteins were assembled on ice and the reaction was initiated by the addition of TRAF6 (where added) prior to incubation for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions (10 μl) contained the following protein concentrations: 150 nm E1, 156 μm ubiquitin or various ubiquitin derivatives, 5 μm UBC13, 5 μm UEV1A, 5 μm UbcH5c, and 300 nm TRAF6. Under these conditions, TRAF6 is limiting relative to E2 based on our titration experiments examining ubiquitin discharge from UBC13 (Fig. 7). For reactions lacking a particular reaction component as indicated, an equivalent volume of ubiquitination reaction buffer was added. At the end of the incubation, an equal volume of denaturing sample buffer was added and the reactions were heated to 70 °C for 5 min prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin (P4D1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and anti-TRAF6 (H-274, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antisera. For time course experiments (Fig. 4), 10-μl aliquots of a 70-μl reaction (conditions as described above) were removed at the indicated times, added to reducing sample buffer, heated to 70 °C for 5 min and analyzed with anti-ubiquitin and anti-TRAF6 immunoblotting. To analyze TRAF6 modification (Fig. 5), TRAF6 was bound to streptavidin-Sepharose (10-μl bead volume with 250 μl of TRAF6 baculovirus-infected insect cell lysate). After washing the Sepharose 3 times with Lysis Buffer (described above) and 2 times with ubiquitination reaction buffer, the indicated E2 subunits (5 μm) were added to reactions containing a final concentration of 150 nm E1 and 100 μm ubiquitin in a 20-μl total volume. After 20 min at room temperature with mixing, non-reducing sample buffer was added directly to 1 set of reactions (“soluble” reactions). The Sepharose for the other set of reactions (“bound” reactions) were washed in Lysis Buffer. TRAF6 was subsequently eluted from the streptavidin-Sepharose by a volume of non-reducing sample buffer equivalent to the total volume of the soluble reactions. Soluble and bound reactions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-ubiquitin and anti-calmodulin-binding peptide (Upstate). UBC13 (2 μm final concentration in 10 μl of charging reaction) was added to reactions containing ubiquitin (156 μm) and 150 nm E1 and incubated for 20 min at room temperature in ubiquitination reaction buffer (described above). The charging reaction was terminated by the addition of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) (5 mm final concentration) and EDTA (10 mm final concentration), followed by a 15-min incubation at room temperature. Discharge reactions containing the various indicated proteins and ubiquitin (312 μm in final discharge reaction) were set up on ice in a ubiquitin reaction buffer without ATP. Reactions were initiated by the addition of an equal volume of charged and treated UBC13 (20 μl total volume), rapidly mixed, and incubated at 37 °C. Aliquots were removed at the indicated times and added to an equal volume of non-reducing SDS-PAGE sample buffer. UBC13-Ub thioester, UBC13, and TRAF6 were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-UBC13 (Invitrogen) and anti-TRAF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antisera. The final concentrations of the proteins used in the reactions shown in Fig. 6 were 1 μm UBC13, 300 nm TRAF6, and 300 nm UEV1A. Fig. 7 utilized UBC13 at 500 nm and variable concentrations of either UEV1A or TRAF6, 200 nm, 500 nm, 1.25 mm, or 2.5 mm, to give the indicated molar ratios. To examine potential downstream effects of NEM in chase reactions, UBC13 (2 μm) was charged with 3.75 μm ubiquitin containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope (Fig. 6, C and D). Reactions were either untreated (-NEM) or treated with NEM (+NEM, 5 mm final concentration) and EDTA (10 mm final concentration) for 15 min prior to adding to chase reactions containing 300 nm UEV1A and 300 nm TRAF6 and ubiquitin (312 μm). The final concentration of UBC13 in the chase reaction was 1 μm. Reaction aliquots were removed at the indicated times and analyzed under non-reducing conditions by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG horseradish peroxidase (Sigma) to detect UBC13-Ub thioester. The x-ray structures for UBC13-MMS2 (Protein Data Bank 1JAT) and MMS2-ubiquitin (PDB 1ZGU) were structurally superimposed on MMS2 using PyMol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA) to generate a model of UBC13-MMS2-ubiquitin (root mean square 0.817). The distance from the amino group of the lysine 63 side chain to the sulfur of the active site cysteine of UBC13 was estimated from this model (see Fig. 8B). Ubiquitin Chain Synthesis by UBC13-UEV1A Is Stimulated by TRAF6—The modification of TRAF6 with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains by UBC13-UEV1A promotes the activation of the kinase TAK1, which leads to the activation of NF-κB gene expression (15Deng L. Wang C. Spencer E. Yang L. Braun A. You J. Slaughter C. Pickart C. Chen Z.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 351-361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1512) Google Scholar, 16Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Unlike ubiquitin ligases that recognize specific substrates that are targets for ubiquitin modification, TRAF6 functions both as a ubiquitin ligase and its own substrate. To study the molecular mechanisms underlying this process, we sought to recapitulate TRAF6 modification with Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains in vitro using purified recombinant proteins (Fig. 1A). We performed experiments to compare the activity of UBC13-UEV1A and TRAF6 separately to the complete reaction. Reaction products were subsequently analyzed for ubiquitin chain synthesis with an anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1B) and TRAF6 modification with anti-TRAF6 (Fig. 1C). Whereas UBC13-UEV1A synthesizes detectable amounts of ubiquitin chains after 30 min in the absence of a ubiquitin ligase, the addition of TRAF6 robustly stimulates this activity (Fig. 1B, compare lanes 1 and 3). As expected, TRAF6 had no detectable activity in the presence of E1, ATP, and ubiquitin (Fig. 1B, lane 2). Despite TRAF6 efficiently stimulating the activity of UBC13-UEV1A to synthesize ubiquitin chains, we did not observe TRAF6 ubiquitination in comparing reactions performed with TRAF6 alone to reactions containing TRAF6 and UBC13-UEV1A (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 2 and 3). To rule out the possibility that our antibody cannot efficiently recognize ubiquitinated TRAF6 (generated against amino acids 1–274), we analyzed TRAF6 in these reactions with other antibodies generated against TRAF6 as well as one of the epitope tags present on this form of TRAF6 (calmodulin binding peptide) and obtained similar results (data not shown). A Promiscuous E2, UbcH5c, Efficiently Ubiquitinates TRAF6—Our observation that TRAF6 is not efficiently ubiquitinated in our in vitro system suggests that TRAF6 may not properly present an appropriate nucleophile (i.e. the amino group of a lysine residue side chain) for modification. Several recent reports have proposed that TRAF6 must oligomerize to form an active ubiquitin ligase complex and various proteins downstream of specific classes of tumor necrosis factor receptors (TIFA, MALT1, BCL10, and others) may facilitate this process (16Sun L. Deng L. Ea C.K. Xia Z.P. Chen Z.J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 289-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 18Dong W. Liu Y. Peng J. Chen L. Zou T. Xiao H. Liu Z. Li W. Bu Y.

A. 2004; 101: 15318-15323Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible the deficiency of TRAF6 ubiquitination in our in vitro system may simply arise from an absence of these factors. To explore this possibility, we tested UbcH5c, a promiscuous ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (20Brzovic P.S. Klevit R.E. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 2867-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), at an identical concentration to UBC13-UEV1A and under identical reaction conditions to determine whether its activity could be stimulated by TRAF6 (Fig. 2). We reasoned if TRAF6 oligomerization through accessory protein function is required for proper assembly into a ubiquitin ligase and substrate, reactions utilizing UbcH5c should have a defect similar to those using UBC13-UEV1A. Moreover, if TRAF6 is unable to present an appropriate nucleophile for modification, this would likely be reflected in reactions with UbcH5c due to the highly conserved enzymatic core of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family (21Pickart C.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 503-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (2920) Google Scholar). In contrast to UBC13-UEV1A, UbcH5c did not detectably generate ubiquitin chains in the absence of TRAF6 (Fig. 2A, lane 1). However, its ability to synthesize ubiquitin chains was stimulated by TRAF6, similar to UBC13-UEV1A (Fig. 2A, lane 3). In examining these reactions for TRAF6 ubiquitination, we observed efficient modification of TRAF6 by UbcH5c such that the majority of TRAF6 was converted into a high molecular mass form (Fig. 2B, lane 3). Taken together, our results suggest that TRAF6 assembles into an active ubiquitin ligase complex in the absence of accessory factors in vitro. Furthermore, TRAF6 is not defective in nucleophile presentation and can serve as a substrate for modification, at least in conjunction with UbcH5c. UBC13 Modifies TRAF6 in the Absence of UEV1A—Our experiments comparing the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRAF6 with UBC13-UEV1A or UbcH5c revealed a critical difference between these E2s. Whereas UbcH5c efficiently modifies TRAF6 and generates ubiquitin conjugates in the presence of TRAF6, it has no detectable ubiquitin-conjugating activity in its absence. UBC13-UEV1A, in contrast, generates detectable amounts of ubiquitin chains even in the absence of TRAF6 (Fig. 1B, lane 1). The presence of TRAF6 stimulates ubiquitin chain synthesis, yet very little modification of TRAF6 occurs (Fig. 1B, lane 3). As the UEV1A subunit binds a ubiquitin molecule to position Lys63 of ubiquitin near the active site cysteine of UBC13, we hypothesized that its presence may drive ubiquitin chain synthesis that in turn may suppress TRAF6 modification. To test this hypothesis, we performed experiments in which we tested the individual subunits of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme in the presence of TRAF6 with either wild-type ubiquitin (Ub) or a form of ubiquitin in which all lysine residues are mutated to arginine and therefore cannot synthesize ubiquitin chains (K0 Ub). In examining ubiquitin chain synthesis in these reactions (Fig. 3A), we detected ubiquitin chain synthesis only in the presence of Ub and both subunits of the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In contrast, however, we observed TRAF6 modification by UBC13 alone in reactions with both Ub and K0 Ub (Fig. 3B, lanes 1 and 4) and with intact UBC13-UEV1A in the presence of K0 Ub (Fig. 3B, lane 6). As the pattern of ubiquitin conjugation on TRAF6 is identical in all of these reactions, regardless of using Ub or K0 Ub, this modification is consistent with single ubiquitin attachments (i.e. “monoubiquitination”) and not ubiquitin chains. This observation is particularly striking when the ability of UbcH5c to generate high molecular weight conjugates on TRAF6 is considered (Fig. 2B, lane 3) as it suggests UBC13 has a very specific function in substrate modification with individual ubiquitin molecules. Furthermore, these experiments suggest that a single site on TRAF6 may be the predominant site of ubiquitin attachment by UBC13, supporting recent observations by Lamonthe et al. (22Lamothe B. Besse A. Campos A.D. Webster W.K. Wu H. Darnay B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 4102-4112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar) that identified a single lysine residue as important for TRAF6 function upstream of NF-κb activation. Lys63 of Ubiquitin and UEV1A Stimulate Ubiquitin Chain Synthesis by UBC13 and Their Absence Promotes Substrate Modification—To test how the presence of Lys63 of ubiquitin affects substrate modification, we performed similar ubiquitination reactions with ubiquitin derivatives, focusing on intact (Lys63 only ubiquitin, with all other lysine residues mutated to arginine) or mutated Lys63 (K63R ubiquitin). Ubiquitin chain synthesis, as expected, requires the presence of both UEV1A and Lys63 of ubiquitin to occur (Fig. 3C, lanes 2 and 8), supporting the hypothesis that the positioning of Lys63 of ubiquitin by UEV1A near the active site cysteine of UBC13 is part of the molecular basis of ubiquitin linkage specificity and our in vitro system recapitulates this specificity. In examining these reactions for TRAF6 modification, we observed that UBC13 alone can modify TRAF6 with a single predominant site of ubiquitin attachment with 2–4 total sites detectable for all ubiquitin derivatives tested (Fig. 3D, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), consistent with multiple monoubiquitination events. Similar to our results with K0 Ub (Fig. 3B), TRAF6 modification occurs in the presence of UEV1A only in the absence of Lys63 (Fig. 3D, lanes 4 and 6), which correlates to an observed lack of ubiquitin chain synthesis (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 6). Our observation that K63R ubiquitin bound to UEV1A did not block TRAF6 modification suggests that these proteins do not simply mask sites of TRAF6 modification. Instead our data are consistent with the hypothesis that ubiquitin chain synthesis may dominate our in vitro system due to a preference for ubiquitin-ubiquitin discharge by UBC13 involving Lys63 of ubiquitin provided by the presence of UEV1A over TRAF6 modification. Ubiquitin Chains Are the Major in Vitro Product Synthesized by UBC13-UEV1A in the Presence of TRAF6—To further explore the role of TRAF6 as both a ubiquitin ligase and substrate, we performed experiments examining the rate of ubiquitin chain synthesis and TRAF6 modification by UBC13-UEV1A, UbcH5c, and UBC13 alone (Fig. 4). As expected, UBC13 alone did not generate detectable ubiquitin chains in the presence of TRAF6 over the time course examined (Fig. 4A, lanes 13–18). UBC13-UEV1A (lanes 1–6) and UbcH5c (lanes 7–12), in contrast, synthesized high molecular weight ubiquitin conjugates with qualitatively similar rates of appearance. These reactions were also analyzed for TRAF6 modification (Fig. 4B). UbcH5c modified TRAF6 such that the majority of the input substrate was converted into a high molecular weight form at the end of the time course analyzed (lanes 7–12). UBC13 alone (lanes 13–18), in contrast, converted TRAF6 considerably slower to a ubiquitinated form. The pattern of ubiquitin incorporation onto TRAF6 by UBC13 at 20 min (lane 18) resembled the pattern generated by UbcH5c at 1 min (lane 8), suggesting that features within the largely conserved catalytic core of these E2s may contribute to their distinct ability to modify TRAF6. Whereas the molecular basis of this difference remains to be further explored, it is unlikely due to differences in the amount of active E2 in the enzyme preparations or their ability to be charged with ubiquitin as both are charged with ubiquitin by E1 with similar rates when tested at similar concentrations (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1–6 to lanes 7–12). As expected, UBC13-UEV1A did not efficiently modify TRAF6 when compared with either UbcH5c or UBC13 (lanes 1–6). However, longer exposures of the data (bottom panels of Fig. 4B) revealed the appearance of faint higher molecular weight species in the presence of UBC13-UEV1A after 5 min (compare lane 1 to lanes 4–6), consistent with ubiquitinated TRAF6. TRAF6 Is Modified with Individual Ubiquitin Molecules by UBC13 and Lys63-linked Ubiquitin Chains by UBC13-UEV1A—Our data investigating ubiquitin chain synthesis and TRAF6 modification suggest a small percentage of TRAF6 is modified by UBC13-UEV1A and ubiquitin chains are the major in vitro reaction products. To directly examine if TRAF6 is modified by UBC13-UEV1A with ubiquitin chains, we performed in vitro experiments using TRAF6 immobilized on streptavidin-Sepharose. By extensively washing Sepharose-bound material after our in vitro reactions, we could directly examine the extent of TRAF6 modification (Fig. 5). In the absence of E2 or with UEV1A alone, we observed no modification of TRAF6 (Fig. 5A, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) and no detectable ubiquitin chain synthesis (Fig. 5B, lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7). As e"
https://openalex.org/W2033572967,"Matching blood flow to myocardial energy demand is vital for heart performance and recovery following ischemia. The molecular mechanisms responsible for transduction of myocardial energetic signals into reactive vasodilatation are, however, elusive. Adenylate kinase, associated with AMP signaling, is a sensitive reporter of the cellular energy state, yet the contribution of this phosphotransfer system in coupling myocardial metabolism with coronary flow has not been explored. Here, knock out of the major adenylate kinase isoform, AK1, disrupted the synchrony between inorganic phosphate Pi turnover at ATP-consuming sites and γ-ATP exchange at ATP synthesis sites, as revealed by 18O-assisted 31P NMR. This reduced energetic signal communication in the post-ischemic heart. AK1 gene deletion blunted vascular adenylate kinase phosphotransfer, compromised the contractility-coronary flow relationship, and precipitated inadequate coronary reflow following ischemia-reperfusion. Deficit in adenylate kinase activity abrogated AMP signal generation and reduced the vascular adenylate kinase/creatine kinase activity ratio essential for the response of metabolic sensors. The sarcolemma-associated splice variant AK1β facilitated adenosine production, a function lost in the absence of adenylate kinase activity. Adenosine treatment bypassed AK1 deficiency and restored post-ischemic flow to wild-type levels, achieving phenotype rescue. AK1 phosphotransfer thus transduces stress signals into adequate vascular response, providing linkage between cell bioenergetics and coronary flow.

Here, knock out of the major adenylate kinase isoform, AK1, disrupted the synchrony between inorganic phosphate Pi turnover at ATP-consuming sites and γ-ATP exchange at ATP synthesis sites, as revealed by 18O-assisted 31P NMR. This reduced energetic signal communication in the post-ischemic heart. AK1 gene deletion blunted vascular adenylate kinase phosphotransfer, compromised the contractility-coronary flow relationship, and precipitated inadequate coronary reflow following ischemia-reperfusion. Deficit in adenylate kinase activity abrogated AMP signal generation and reduced the vascular adenylate kinase/creatine kinase activity ratio essential for the response of metabolic sensors. The sarcolemma-associated splice variant AK1β facilitated adenosine production, a function lost in the absence of adenylate kinase activity. Adenosine treatment bypassed AK1 deficiency and restored post-ischemic flow to wild-type levels, achieving phenotype rescue. AK1 phosphotransfer thus transduces stress signals into adequate vascular response, providing linkage between cell bioenergetics and coronary flow. Coronary blood flow is tightly linked to myocardial oxygen consumption securing adequate oxygenation and nutrient delivery and preventing underperfusion (1Berne R.M. Circ.

Hearts were freeze-clamped, pulverized under liquid N2, and extracted in a solution containing 0.6 m HClO4 and 1 mm EDTA. Extracts were neutralized with 2 m KHCO3 and used to determine 18O incorporation. 18O labeling of Pi and γ-ATP was determined with 18O-assisted 31P NMR spectroscopy. High resolution 31P[16O] and 31P[18O] spectra were acquired at 202.5 MHz on a Bruker 11 T spectrometer (Avance) in 5-mm tubes at ambient temperature. For 31P spectra, signal accumulation (36,000 scans) was run without relaxation delay (acquisition time 1.61 s) with a pulse width of 10 μs (53° angle). Incorporation of each 18O induces isotope shifts of 0.0210 and 0.0228 ppm in the 31P NMR spectrum of Pi and γ-ATP, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1989032879,"BRE binds to the cytoplasmic domains of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 and Fas, and in cell lines can attenuate death receptor-initiated apoptosis by inhibiting t-BID-induced activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Overexpression of BRE by transfection can also attenuate intrinsic apoptosis and promote growth of the transfected Lewis lung carcinoma line in mice. There is, however, a complete lack of in vivo data about the protein. Here, we report that by using our BRE-specific monoclonal antibody on the immunohistochemistry of 123 specimens of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), significant differences in BRE expression levels between the paired tumoral and non-tumoral regions (P<2.2e-16) were found. Marked overexpression of BRE was detected in majority of the tumors, whereas most non-tumoral regions expressed the same low level of the protein as in normal livers. To investigate whether BRE overexpression could promote cell survival in vivo, liver-specific transgenic BRE mice were generated and found to be significantly resistant to Fas-mediated lethal hepatic apoptosis. The transgenic model also revealed post-transcriptional regulation of Bre level in the liver, which was not observed in HCC and non-HCC cell lines. Indeed, all cell lines analysed express high levels of BRE. In conclusion, BRE is antiapoptotic in vivo, and may promote tumorigenesis when overexpressed."
https://openalex.org/W2004247858,"SecG, a subunit of the protein translocon, undergoes a cycle of topology inversion. To further examine the role of this topology inversion, we analyzed the activity of membrane vesicles carrying a SecG-PhoA fusion protein (SecG-PhoA inverted membrane vesicles (IMVs)). In the absence of externally added SecA, SecG-PhoA IMVs were as active in protein translocation as SecG+ IMVs per SecA. Consistent with this observation, insertion of membrane-bound SecA into SecG-PhoA IMVs was normally observed. On the other hand, externally added SecA did not affect the activity of SecG-PhoA IMVs, but it caused >10-fold stimulation of the translocation activity of SecG+ IMVs, indicating that the topology inversion of SecG, which cannot occur in SecG-PhoA IMVs, is essential for cytosolic SecA-dependent stimulation of protein translocation. SecG-PhoA IMVs generated a 46-kDa fragment of SecA upon trypsin treatment. The accumulation of this membrane-inserted SecA in the SecG-PhoA IMVs was responsible for the loss of the soluble SecA-dependent stimulation. Moreover, fixation of the inverted SecG topology was found to be dependent on soluble SecA. The dual functions of SecG in protein translocation will be discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1987236281,"In epithelial cells, the apical junctional complex (AJC), composed of tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs), maintains cell-surface polarity by forming a fence that prevents lateral movement and diffusion of proteins and lipids between the apical and basolateral PM and holds the epithelial monolayer intact through cell-cell contacts. Disassembly of this complex is a prime event in development and cell transformation. Maintenance of the AJC has been shown to involve mainly the actin cytoskeleton. Recent findings also point to the involvement of the microtubule (MT) system. Here we show the first evidence that in polarized epithelial MDCK cells, ARF-like protein 2 (ARL2) and beta-tubulin cofactor D, known to be involved in MT dynamics, have a role in disassembly of the AJC followed by cell dissociation from the epithelial monolayer, which is not dependent on MT depolymerization. In addition, we show that beta-tubulin cofactor D is partially localized to the lateral PM through its 15 C-terminal amino acids and intact MTs. ARL2 inhibited beta-tubulin cofactor D-dependent cell dissociation from the monolayer and AJC disassembly. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that beta-tubulin cofactor D plays a role in cells independent of its presumed role in folding tubulin heterodimers. We conclude that ARL2 and beta-tubulin cofactor D participate in AJC disassembly and epithelial depolarization."

Because enamel formation occurs during postnatal development and C/EBPα-deficient mice die at birth, we used the Cre/loxP recombination system to characterize amelogenin expression in C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. Mice carrying the Cre transgene under the control of the human keratin-14 promoter show robust Cre expression in the ameloblast cell lineage. Mating between mice bearing the floxed C/EBPα allele with keratin-14-Cre mice generate C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. Real-time PCR analysis shows that removal of one C/EBPα allele from the molar enamel epithelial organ of 3-day postnatal mice results in dramatic decrease in endogenous C/EBPα mRNA levels and coordinately altered amelogenin mRNA abundance. Conditional deletion of both C/EBPα alleles further diminishes C/EBPα mRNA levels; however, rather than ablating amelogenin expression, we observe wild-type amelogenin mRNA abundance levels. We examined C/EBPβ and nuclear factor YA expression, two transcription factors that had previously been shown to modestly participate in amelogenin expression, in vitro but found no significant changes in either of their mRNA abundance levels comparing conditional knock-out mice with wild-type counterparts. Although the abundance of C/EBPδ is also unchanged in C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice, in vitro we find that C/EBPδ activates the mouse amelogenin promoter and synergistically cooperates with nuclear factor Y, suggesting that C/EBPδ can functionally substitute for C/EBPα to produce an enamel matrix competent to direct biomineralization.

Therefore, we used the K14 promoter to drive Cre-mediated recombination of floxed C/EBPα loci predicted to result in the loss of amelogenin expression. Here we report on the generation of C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice created by crossing mice bearing the C/EBPαfl/fl with K14-Cre mice. This conditional ablation allowed us to investigate the relationship between C/EBPα and amelogenin expression in vivo utilizing real-time PCR technique to measure mRNA levels. We find that in the absence of mRNA for C/EBPα that C/EBPδ is redundant, serving to maintain amelogenin expression at wild-type levels in C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Transient transfection and luciferase assays were performed as described previously (3Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Luo W. Zhu Q.S. Levy D. MacDougald O.A. Snead M.L. J.

For ease of identification, we refer to the wild-type animal as C/EBPα+/+, the wt/fl;K14-Cre animal as C/EBPα+/–, and the fl/fl;K14-Cre animal as C/EBPα–/– to allow the C/EBPα allele status to be easily tracked. Genotyping of Wild-type (+), loxP-targeted (fl), and Cre-mediated Recombination (–) for C/EBPα Alleles—Genomic DNA from mouse tails was isolated by digestion in a buffer containing 0.6 mg/ml proteinase K, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 100 mm EDTA, and 0.5% SDS at 55 °C overnight. The solution was subjected to extraction with phenol, phenol/chloroform, and chloroform. DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes of ethanol. An additional wash step in 70% ethanol was essential to remove traces of SDS and phenol before biochemical manipulation. As shown in Fig. 1A, PCR primers F4, (5′-AACCTCCACCTCCCCTCG-3′), F6 (5′-TCTGATGCCGCCGTGTTC-3′), F7 (5′-CTCCAGTGTGGTCTGTGTTGG-3′), B4 (5′-GCCAAACCCCGTGTTCAC-3′), and B6 (5′-CCCCTGATGCTCTTCGTCCAG-3′) were used to differentiate the wild-type, floxed C/EBPα, and knock-out C/EBPα allele. The F7/B4 primer pairs were used to detect the 600-bp wild-type allele, the F6/B6 primer pairs were used to detect the 400-bp floxed C/EBPα allele, and the F4/B4 primer pairs were used to detect the 900-bp knock-out allele (Fig. 1A). The primer pair used to identify the 700-bp Cre allele was: forward primer, 5′-TGCTGTTTCACTGGTTATGC GG-3′, and reverse primer, 5′-CCATTGCCCCTGTTTCACTATCC-3′. Detection of Cre-mediated Recombination by β-Galactosidase (lacZ) Staining—Cells undergoing recombination were identified using the Cre/loxP system in which the K14-Cre transgene mediated DNA recombination after being crossed with the ROSA26 reporter transgene (17Soriano P. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar). As a consequence to recombination, β-galactosidase expression was activated and restricted to the cells where the K14 promoter was expressed at levels sufficient to cause Cre-mediated activation of the ROSA26 marker. To assess K14 promoter activity in mouse teeth, first molars were dissected from newborn mice and stained for β-galactosidase activity. Molars were fixed over-night at 4 °C in 0.2% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed 3 times in rinse solution (0.005% Nonidet P-40 and 0.01% sodium deoxycholate in PBS). Tissues were stained overnight at 37 °C using a staining solution containing 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide, and 0.4% X-gal, rinsed twice in PBS, and post-fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde. Cryostat Sectioning—Mandibles of newborn mice were prepared for frozen sections and stained according to standard procedures. In brief, tissues were fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde solution overnight at 4 °C, immersed in 10% sucrose in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 for 30 min at 25 °C, incubated in 30% sucrose, 50% OCT (optimum cutting temperature, Sakura Finetek USA, Inc., Torrance, CA), 2 mm MgCl2 in PBS for 1.5 h at 4 °C and embedded in OCT by freezing on dry ice. Sections were cut at a 10-μm thickness, mounted on gelatin-coated slides, fixed in 0.2% glutaraldehyde for 10 min on ice, and rinsed twice in PBS containing 2 mm MgCl2 followed by a 10-min wash in PBS with 2 mm MgCl2. Tissue sections were incubated in the detergent rinse solution (2 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% sodium deoxycholate in PBS) for 10 min at 4 °C, and chromogen was developed in X-gal-staining solution overnight at 37 °C in the dark. Epithelial-Mesenchyme Separation of Molars from 3-Day Postnatal Mice—The first and second molars were dissected free of the mandible and incubated in 1% dispase (Invitrogen) in PBS for 1 h on ice. The sheets of epithelial cells were separated from the underling extracellular matrix with mesenchyme-derived cells and subjected to RNA extraction. RNA Extraction and Reverse Transcription—Total RNA from enamel organ epithelial cells from the first and second molars of 3-day postnatal mice was extracted by using the RNA-Bee reagent (TEL-TEST, Inc., Friendswood, TX). First strand cDNA was synthesized with 100 ng of random oligodeoxynucleotide decamers using a RETROscript reverse transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Real-time PCR Analysis—PCR was carried out with the IQ SYBR green supermix kit (Bio-Rad) in a 20-μl final volume, 3–4 mm MgCl2, and 0.2–0.4 μm each primer (final concentration). Detailed primer sequences for each target gene are shown in supplemental Table 1. For analyzing C/EBPα, amelogenin, NF-YA, and β-actin, PCR was performed using the iCycler iQ multicolor real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 10 s and 55 °C for 45 s. For C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ analysis, PCR was performed for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 59 °C for 20 s, and 72 °C for 20 s. Amplification specificity was verified by analysis of the data derived from the melting curve for each sample after the manufacturer's instructions. The iCycler iQ real-time PCR detection system software Version 3.1 was used to analyze results, and the PCR base-line subtraction curve-fit function was used to determine threshold cycle (CT) values. The threshold cycle value was converted to mRNA abundance, using an algorithm provided by the manufacturer. Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts and electrophoresis mobility shift assay were performed as described previously (3Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Luo W. Zhu Q.S. Levy D. MacDougald O.A. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16090-16098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assays—ChIP assays were performed according to the protocol for the EZ ChIP kit (17-371, Upstate Biotechnology, Temecula, CA). Cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at 25 °C. After washing with ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in SDS lysis buffer (6 × 106 cells/0.4 ml of SDS lysis buffer) for 10 min on ice and sonicated at 4 watts for 4 pulses of 10 s each using a VirSonic 60 sonicator (Virtis Co., Gardiner, NY). Cell debris were removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The soluble chromatin (100 μl per immunoprecipitation assay) was transferred to a new Eppendorf tube and diluted 10 times in ChIP dilution buffer followed by preclearing with 60 μl of protein G-agarose beads (16-201C, Upstate Biotechnology) for 60 min at 4 °C with rotation. The precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated using antibodies for either non-immune IgG (5 μg, PP64B, Upstate Biotechnology), C/EBPα (5 μg, sc-61x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or C/EBPδ (5 μg, sc-636x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of protein G-agarose beads and washed once with 1 ml of low salt wash buffer, once with 1 ml of high salt wash buffer, once with 1 ml of LiCl wash buffer, and twice with 1 ml of Tris-EDTA buffer. Immune complexes were eluted with elution buffer, and cross-links were reversed and treated with proteinase K. DNA was recovered using spin columns. The resulting ChIP DNA solution was diluted 100 times, and 2 μl of DNA was used for PCR detection. To amplify the 200-bp product, the primer set was 5′-GCTTCCCAAACCTATTATTGCCTG-3′ and 5′-TTTCTTCCAACTCTGTGCCCC-3′; to amplify the 584-bp product, the primer set was 5′-CTACTGTAATAGTCTTGAGGTCGTGGC-3′ and 5′-CGATGGTTTCTTCCAACTCT GTGC-3′. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analysis was performed using the one-way analysis of variance test, and statistical significance is defined as p < 0.05. K14-Cre Transgenic Mice Robustly Express Cre Recombinase in the Ameloblast Cell Lineage—The K14-Cre transgenic mice were bred with R26R mice to generate transgenic animals in which expression of the β-galactosidase occurs only upon Cremediated DNA excision. When newborn mandibles of K14-Cre;R26R mice were prepared for histologic examination, X-gal positive cells were restricted to the enamel organ of the incisor and molar teeth, including the ameloblasts (Fig. 1C). The first molar of newborn pups, with the genotype of K14-Cre;R26R, was isolated and subject to whole-mount X-gal staining. As expected, the lacZ expression was uniformly distributed in enamel organ epithelial cells, whereas no lacZ stain was observed in mesenchymal cells (Fig. 1, B, panels a– c, and C, panel f). In the lower incisor, the lacZ activity was detected only in enamel organ epithelial cells from the earliest stage of ameloblast differentiation within the stem cell compartment continuously through the fully differentiated ameloblasts lining the incisor tip region (Fig. 1C). The enamel organ of the lingual surface of the incisor, an area that does not develop as secretory ameloblasts, was also identified as lacZ-positive (Fig. 1C, open arrows). When examined in histologic sections, some unstained ameloblast cells were observed sporadically, suggesting an incomplete recombination event in some cells from the enamel organ (Fig. 1C, panel d and e, solid arrows). K14-Cre-mediated C/EBPα Ablation in Mouse Ameloblast Cell Lineage—To specifically disrupt C/EBPα gene expression in the ameloblast cell lineage (Fig. 1A), C/EBPαfl/fl (fl, flanked by loxP sites) mice were bred with K14-Cre transgenic mice to generate C/EBPα+/– heterozygous conditional knock-out mice. Subsequent mating between C/EBPα+/– mice produced homozygous conditional knock-out mice, C/EBPα–/–. RNA extracted from molar enamel organ epithelial cells of 3-day postnatal mice was reverse-transcribed, and the first strand cDNA was subject to real-time PCR analysis. C/EBPα mRNA transcripts were reduced significantly upon removal of one C/EBPα allele, and upon removal of the second C/EBPα allele (p < 0.01, Fig. 2A), this finding suggested successful K14-Cre-mediated C/EBPα gene excision to generate a conditional C/EBPα knock-out in the enamel organ epithelium. The level of C/EBPα in C/EBPα+/– mice was reduced to 41–55% that of levels compared with expression levels observed in wild-type control mice, whereas the level of C/EBPα in C/EBPα–/– mice was reduced to 2–32% that in wild-type control mice (Fig. 2A). C/EBPα has been demonstrated as the strong transactivator of the amelogenin gene (1Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Erickson R.L. Macdougald O.A. Snead M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Ann D.K. MacDougald O.A. Shum L. Snead M.L. Eur. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and ablation of the C/EBPα gene is expected to affect amelogenin expression. Therefore, we examined the expression level of amelogenin mRNA from each of these C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice that varied only by the C/EBPα allele number. Amelogenin was reduced upon removal of one C/EBPα allele, with 61–85% of the amelogenin transcript abundance in C/EBPα+/– mice compared with the abundance found in wildtype control mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, once two C/EBPα alleles were excised, we identified that the amelogenin mRNA transcript abundance for the C/EBPα–/– mice returned to the wild-type level (p > 0.05, Fig. 2E). This finding suggests that amelogenin transcript abundance in vivo is independent of C/EBPα expression levels. Rather, amelogenin transcript abundance is compensated by an unknown mechanism(s) upon excision of two C/EBPα alleles. Several studies have suggested potential roles of C/EBPβ and NF-Y in facilitating C/EBPα-mediated transactivation (5Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 18Zhu Q.S. Qian B. Levy D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 29902-29910Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Functional assays were used to show that either C/EBPβ or NF-Y alone has only marginal effects on the amelogenin promoter (Fig. 3, lane 2 and 3). Although NF-Y and C/EBPβ enhance the amelogenin promoter some 3.5-fold (Fig. 3, lane 5), this gain is ablated in the presence of a mutated NF-YA (NF-Yam29) (Fig. 3, lane 6). Nonetheless, it is possible that increased levels of C/EBPβ and/or NF-Y mRNA level could lead to increased protein levels sufficient to activate the amelogenin promoter and produce enough amelogenin proteins to compensate for the loss of both C/EBPα alleles. Based upon this hypothesis, the level of C/EBPβ and NF-YA transcripts were ascertained in this study. We did not observe a significant change in the level of C/EBPβ among mice with either one or both C/EBPα alleles removed (p > 0.05, Fig. 2B). The expression level of C/EBPβ in mice in which there was only one C/EBPα allele (C/EBPα+/–) was 75–134% that observed in wild-type control mice, and the expression level of C/EBPβ in mice with no C/EBPα allele (C/EBPα–/–) was 100–189% that observed in wild-type control mice (Fig. 2B). In addition there was no significant difference in the level of NF-YA in either instance in which only the C/EBPα allele number varied (p > 0.05, Fig. 2D). The level of NF-YA in heterozygous mice (C/EBPα+/–) was 70–101% that of the expression levels observed in wild-type control mice. The level of NF-YA in conditional knock-out mice (C/EBPα–/–) was 55–125% that observed in wild-type control mice. Standard histologic examination of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained 3-day postnatal mouse mandibles showed that the enamel thickness of incisors ( supplemental Fig. S1A) and molars ( supplemental Fig. S1B) was not grossly affected in mice with a complete absence of C/EBPα (C/EBPα–/–) when compared with enamel thickness of wild-type control mice. The absence of detectable diminution of the enamel thickness in the C/EBPα conditional knock-out animal is not surprising given the observed compensation that restored amelogenin mRNA levels to wild-type levels (Fig. 2E). However, it is unlikely that C/EBPβ and NF-Y, even working in combination, are sufficient to restore amelogenin abundance to the near wild-type levels that are observed (Fig. 2) especially in the absence of significant increases in C/EBPβ and NF-Y mRNA abundance in the teeth from C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. C/EBPδ Is Able to Activate the Mouse Amelogenin Promoter— The finding that the amelogenin mRNA level is restored upon excision of both CEBPα alleles prompted us to search for an alternative pathway in the regulation of the amelogenin gene. C/EBPδ was regarded as a candidate because both C/EBPδ and C/EBPα have similar nucleotide sequence preferences for promoter binding (19Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). To test of whether C/EBPδ could function as a transactivator of the mouse amelogenin promoter, a C/EBPδ expression vector was co-transfected into LS8 cells with different amelogenin promoter reporter constructs: p2207-luc (the full-length amelogenin promoter), p70-luc (the minimal amelogenin promoter), mC/EBP-p2207-luc (the full-length amelogenin promoter with the mutated C/EBP site), and mC/EBP-p70-luc (the minimal amelogenin promoter with the mutated C/EBP site). Mutation of the C/EBP site abolished the basal promoter activity of mutant reporter constructs (mC/EBP-p2207-luc and mC/EBP-p70-luc) and their C/EBPδ-mediated transaction, whereas the reporter gene activity of wild-type constructs (p2207-luc, and p70-luc) was increased dramatically by co-transfection with C/EBPδ (Fig. 4A). This level of transactivation for the amelogenin promoter by C/EBPδ is similar to that observed for C/EBPα (5Zhou Y.L. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data indicate that the C/EBP site is required to maintain basal amelogenin promoter activity and is responsive to either C/EBPδ or C/EBPα. Previous data has shown that NF-Y and C/EBPα synergistically activates the mouse amelogenin promoter (3Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Luo W. Zhu Q.S. Levy D. MacDougald O.A. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16090-16098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). To investigate whether C/EBPδ has similar potency to that of C/EBPα, NF-Y and C/EBPδ expression plasmids were co-transfected with the p70-luc reporter construct into LS8 cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, C/EBPδ alone increased the promoter activity about 8-fold (lane 2), whereas exogenous expression of NF-Y in isolation had only marginal effects on the promoter (lane 3). Co-transfection of C/EBPδ with NF-Y served to synergistically increase the promoter activity to 16-fold (Fig. 4B, lane 5), a level that was two times more than that of C/EBPδ only. Furthermore, the presence of mutant NF-YA (NF-YAm29) greatly reduced the promoter activity either in the absence (Fig. 4B, lane 4) or in the presence (lane 6) of exogenous C/EBPδ expression. These observations demonstrate that NF-Y facilitates C/EBPδ similarly to the way it does for C/EBPα, to synergistically activate the mouse amelogenin promoter. However, NF-Y by itself exhibits only a marginal effect on the amelogenin promoter. Nuclear extracts prepared from LS8 cells transfected with the C/EBPδ expression plasmid (NE/δ) were supershifted by the C/EBPδ antibody (Fig. 5, lane 4) as well as by the NF-Y antibody (Fig. 5, lane 6). The ChIP assay was performed to assess the interaction of the mouse amelogenin promoter with its transcription factor C/EBPα or C/EBPδ in ameloblast-like LS8 cells transfected with the full-length mouse amelogenin promoter containing plasmid together with either the C/EBPα or the C/EBPδ expression vector. As a negative control, nonimmune IgG did not show the enrichment for the amelogenin proximal promoter region, whereas both C/EBPα and C/EBPδ antibodies were able to enrich the promoter fragment containing the C/EBP consensus binding motif (Fig. 6). Moreover, the capacity of the endogenous amelogenin promoter to respond to C/EBPα or C/EBPδ alone and in the presence of NF-Y was assessed in ameloblast-like LS8 cells. The endogenous amelogenin promoter is responsive to either C/EBPα or C/EBPδ alone (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) with each factor individually enhancing amelogenin mRNA greater than 10-fold. In the presence of NF-Y, either C/EBPα or C/EBPδ amelogenin mRNA transcript abundance nearly doubled (Fig. 7, lanes 5 and 6, respectively).FIGURE 6ChIP analysis for the binding of C/EBPα or C/EBPδ on the mouse amelogenin promoter. A–C, LS8 cells (100 mm plate) were transfected with p2207-luc (500 ng) with the expression vector for either C/EBPα (800 ng) or C/EBPδ (800 ng) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were fixed, sonicated, and incubated with an non-immune IgG or an anti-C/EBPα antibody (sc-61x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or an anti-C/EBPδ antibody (sc-636x, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and immunoprecipitated with protein G-agarose beads (16–201C, Upstate Biotechnology).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 7NF-Y facilitates C/EBPα or C/EBPδ and synergistically induces the endogenous amelogenin promoter as measured by mRNA transcripts.

The mRNA expression level from the endogenous amelogenin gene was determined by real-time PCR analysis. Data represents three independent experiments, each done in triplicate.

Thus, it is reasonable to propose a hypothesis that the synergism between NF-Y and C/EBPδ compensates for the absence of C/EBPα, restoring amelogenin expression levels to approximately wild-type status in vivo. Data from several in vitro experimental strategies have demonstrated that C/EBPα is a strong transactivator for amelogenin gene expression (1Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Erickson R.L. Macdougald O.A. Snead M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Ann D.K. MacDougald O.A. Shum L. Snead M.L. Eur. J.

As a step in exploring the function of C/EBPα in regulating amelogenin activation in vivo and to circumvent the lethal neonatal phenotype in the conventional C/EBPα knock-out mice (6Wang N.D. Finegold M.J. Bradley A. Ou C.N. Abdelsayed S.V. Wilde M.D. Taylor L.R. Wilson D.R. Darlington G.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1108-1112Crossref PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar, 7Flodby P. Barlow C.

A. 2001; 98: 12532-12537Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), we generated a conditional knock-out mouse strain in which the C/EBPα allele(s) was removed upon the expression of Cre recombinase under the control of K14 promoter. We used the R26R mouse to report on the cell-specific expression of Cre recombinase. The K14 promoter drove Cre expression robustly as demonstrated by the lacZ staining in the enamel organ epithelia, specifically localizing to the ameloblast cell lineage from molars and incisors. However, some unstained ameloblast cells were observed sporadically in the lower incisor. One explanation for this “sparing” is that expression of Cre recombinase in those cells unmarked by lacZ is below the threshold required for recombination and results in an incomplete gene excision indicated by the failure to express lacZ. To prevent potential contamination from mesenchymal cells, in which K14-Cre would not be active, molars of 3-day postnatal mice were dissected, and the epithelial cells were mechanically separated from the mesenchyme. We examined the expression level of amelogenin with regard to the C/EBPα allele number in these conditional knock-out mice. The amelogenin mRNA transcripts decreased in the C/EBPα heterozygous conditional knock-out mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 2E). Surprisingly, in the C/EBPα homozygous conditional knock-out mice, amelogenin abundance was measured essentially at the wild-type expression level (Fig. 2E). This finding strongly implies the existence of an alternative pathway for the activation of the amelogenin gene in vivo. We examined the level of C/EBPβ and NF-YA in these C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. Neither the level of C/EBPβ nor NF-YA was significantly affected in the mice with reduced C/EBPα allele numbers and consequently reduced C/EBPα mRNA levels. This observation is correlated with the finding that C/EBPβ and NF-Y exert only arithmetic accumulation effects in activating the amelogenin gene (Fig. 3), not the synergistic effect on the amelogenin gene as observed by over-expressing C/EBPα and NF-Y (3Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Luo W. Zhu Q.S. Levy D. MacDougald O.A. Snead M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16090-16098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Therefore, C/EBPβ and NF-Y are not likely to be capable of activating the amelogenin gene to the wild-type level in C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained 3-day postnatal mouse mandibles failed to show that enamel thickness was dramatically affected in C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice compared with the enamel thickness observed in wild-type control mice ( supplemental Fig. S1). The amelogenin expression level in the C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice suggested an alternative mechanism that circumvents the C/EBPα-mediated activation of amelogenin expression observed in vitro (1Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Erickson R.L. Macdougald O.A. Snead M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 354: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 2Xu Y. Zhou Y.L. Ann D.K. MacDougald O.A. Shum L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 12273-12280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In searching for the potential candidate, C/EBPδ was analyzed because C/EBPα and C/EBPδ share the same binding site to the promoter (19Osada S. Yamamoto H. Nishihara T. Imagawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). Data demonstrate that C/EBPδ, like C/EBPα, is able to bind to the amelogenin promoter (Figs. 5 and 6) and activates the mouse amelogenin promoter (Fig. 4). NF-Y could facilitate either C/EBPα or C/EBPδ to induce endogenous amelogenin expression in LS8 cells (Fig. 7). Immunohistochemistry for C/EBPδ protein revealed a nuclear localization in ameloblast cells ( supplemental Fig. S2). However, we did not observe an increased C/EBPδ mRNA level in the enamel organ epithelia of the C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice. One explanation is that the mRNA level of a certain gene is not always proportional to its protein levels or to the functional activity of the protein. Although there is no significant change at the mRNA level of C/EBPδ, the activity of C/EBPδ protein may be increased, due to post-transcriptional and/or post-translational modifications, an outcome that is sufficient to produce enough amelogenin proteins in the C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice to build an apparently normal enamel matrix ( supplemental Fig. S1). Several studies have demonstrated a functional redundancy in the C/EBP family (21Chen S.S. Chen J.F. Johnson P.F. Muppala V. Lee Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7292-7299Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 22Jones L.C. Lin M.L. Chen S.S. Krug U. Hofmann W.K. Lee S. Lee Y.H. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 2002; 99: 2032-2036Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that C/EBPδ and C/EBPα may have the functional redundancy in the regulation of mouse amelogenin gene. Here, we report on the generation of C/EBPα conditional knock-out mice, in which C/EBPα alleles are specifically excised by Cre recombinase driven by the K14 promoter. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrated successful Cre-mediated C/EBPα ablation in mouse ameloblast cell lineages in vivo. Amelogenin mRNA levels were decreased in C/EBPα heterozygous conditional knock-out mice. However, amelogenin mRNA levels returned to the wild-type level in C/EBPα homozygous conditional knock-out mice. This finding implies an existence of an alternative pathway bypassing the C/EBPα pathway and compensating for the loss of C/EBPα. In a search for other transcription factor(s) responsible for the induction of the amelogenin gene, we identified C/EBPδ. Like C/EBPα, C/EBPδ showed a similar synergistic potency with NF-Y to activate the mouse amelogenin promoter, a finding that suggests a functional redundancy between C/EBPα and C/EBPδ. We have successfully utilized ChIP assay to demonstrate the binding of C/EBPα or C/EBPδ on the amelogenin promoter in LS8 cells in vitro. We are in the process of performing in vivo ChIP assay to investigate interactions of C/EBPα and C/EBPδ on the amelogenin promoter during the process of amelogenesis. The ultimate test will be to examine amelogenin expression and subsequent enamel biomineralization in C/EBPα and C/EBPδ double knock-out mice.

The potential functional roles of 10 conserved aspartate and glutamate residues in hCNT1 were investigated by site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Initially, each of the 10 residues was replaced by the corresponding neutral amino acid (asparagine or glutamine). Five of the resulting mutants showed unchanged Na+-dependent uridine transport activity (D172N, E338Q, E389Q, E413Q, and D565N) and were not investigated further. Three were retained in intracellular membranes (D482N, E498Q, and E532Q) and thus could not be assessed functionally. The remaining two (E308Q and E322Q) were present in normal quantities at cell surfaces but exhibited low intrinsic transport activities. Charge replacement with the alternate acidic amino acid enabled correct processing of D482E and E498D, but not of E532D, to cell surfaces and also yielded partially functional E308D and E322D. Relative to wild-type hCNT1, only D482E exhibited normal transport kinetics, whereas E308D, E308Q, E322D, E322Q, and E498D displayed increased K50Na+ and/or Kmuridine values and diminished VmaxNa+ and Vmaxuridine values. E322Q additionally exhibited uridine-gated uncoupled Na+ transport. Together, these findings demonstrate roles for Glu-308, Glu-322, and Glu-498 in Na+/nucleoside cotransport and suggest locations within a common cation/nucleoside translocation pore. Glu-322, the residue having the greatest influence on hCNT1 transport function, exhibited uridine-protected inhibition by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate when converted to cysteine.

Relative to wild-type hCNT1, only D482E exhibited normal transport kinetics, whereas E308D, E308Q, E322D, E322Q, and E498D displayed increased K50Na+ and/or Kmuridine values and diminished VmaxNa+ and Vmaxuridine values. E322Q additionally exhibited uridine-gated uncoupled Na+ transport. Together, these findings demonstrate roles for Glu-308, Glu-322, and Glu-498 in Na+/nucleoside cotransport and suggest locations within a common cation/nucleoside translocation pore. Glu-322, the residue having the greatest influence on hCNT1 transport function, exhibited uridine-protected inhibition by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate and 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate when converted to cysteine. Most nucleosides, including nucleoside analogs with antineoplastic and/or antiviral activity, are hydrophilic molecules that require specialized plasma membrane nucleoside transporter (NT) 4The abbreviations used are: NT, nucleoside transporter; CNT, concentrative nucleoside transporter; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [(triethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide; PCMBS, sodium p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate; TM, putative transmembrane helix; h, human.4The abbreviations used are: NT, nucleoside transporter; CNT, concentrative nucleoside transporter; ENT, equilibrative nucleoside transporter; MTS, methanethiosulfonate; MTSEA, 2-aminoethyl methanethiosulfonate hydrobromide; MTSES, sodium (2-sulfonatoethyl) methanethiosulfonate; MTSET, [(triethylammonium)ethyl] methanethiosulfonate bromide; PCMBS, sodium p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate; TM, putative transmembrane helix; h, human. proteins for uptake into or release from cells (1Cass, C.

Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), studies of structurally and functionally important residues within the CNT protein family are still at an early stage. Topological investigations suggest that hCNT1–3 and other eukaryote CNT family members have a 13 (or possibly 15)-transmembrane helix (TM) architecture, and multiple alignments reveal strong sequence similarities within the C-terminal half of the proteins (20Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W.L. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol.

Prokaryote CNTs lack the first three TMs of their eukaryote counterparts, and functional expression of N-terminally truncated human/rat CNT1 in Xenopus oocytes has established that the first three TMs are not required for Na+-dependent uridine transport activity (20Hamilton S.R. Yao S.Y.M. Ingram J.C. Hadden D.A. Ritzel M.W.L. Gallagher M.P. Henderson P.J.F. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. J. Biol.

In hCNT1, two sets of adjacent residues in TM 7 and 8 have been identified (Ser-319/Gln-320 and Ser-353/Leu-354) that, when converted to the corresponding residues in hCNT2, change the nucleoside specificity of the transporter from CNT1-type to CNT2-type (21Loewen S.K. Ng A.M.L. Yao S.Y.M. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24475-24484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Mutation of Ser-319 in TM 7 of hCNT1 to glycine was sufficient to enable transport of purine nucleosides, whereas mutation of the adjacent residue Gln-320 to methionine (which had no effect on its own) augmented this transport. The additional mutation of Ser-353 in TM 8 of hCNT1 to threonine converted S319G/Q320M from broadly selective (CNT3-type) to purine nucleoside-selective (CNT2-type) but with relatively low adenosine transport activity. Further mutation of Leu-354 to valine increased the adenosine transport capability of S319G/Q320M/S353T, producing a full CNT2-type phenotype. Residues in both TMs 7 and 8 therefore play key roles in determining hCNT1/2 nucleoside selectivities. Confirming this, the double TM 8 mutant (S353T/L354V) was recently shown to exhibit a unique uridine-preferring transport phenotype (22Slugoski M.D. Loewen S.K. Ng A.M.L. Smith K.M. Yao S.Y.M. Karpinski E. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1684-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Mutation of Leu-354 alone markedly increased the affinity of the transporter for Na+ and Li+, demonstrating that TM 8 also has a role in cation coupling (22Slugoski M.D. Loewen S.K. Ng A.M.L.

Constructs were sequenced in both directions by Taq dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing to ensure that only the correct mutation had been introduced. Production of Wild-type and Mutant hCNT1 Proteins in Xenopus Oocytes—hCNT1 cDNAs were transcribed with T7 polymerase and expressed in oocytes of Xenopus laevis by standard procedures (36Yao, S. Y. M., Cass, C. E., and Young, J. D. (2000) in Membrane Transport: A Practical Approach (Baldwin, S. A., ed) pp. 47-78, Oxford University Press, OxfordGoogle Scholar). Healthy defolliculated stage VI oocytes were microinjected with 10 nl of water or 10 nl of water containing RNA transcript (1 ng/nl) and incubated in modified Barth's medium at 18 °C for 72 h prior to the assay of transport activity. Flux Assays—Transport was traced using 14C/3H-labeled nucleosides at 1 μCi/ml. Flux measurements were performed at room temperature (20 °C) as described previously (36Yao, S. Y. M., Cass, C.

Briefly, groups of 12 oocytes were incubated in 200 μl of transport medium containing either 100 mm NaCl or choline chloride and 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5. Unless otherwise indicated, the uridine concentration was 10 μm. At the end of the incubation period, extracellular label was removed by six rapid washes in ice-cold Na+-free (choline chloride) transport medium, and individual oocytes were dissolved in 1% (w/v) SDS for quantitation of oocyte-associated radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting (LS 6000 IC; Beckman). Initial rates of transport (influx) were determined using an incubation period of 1 min, except for mutants E322Q and E322D, which had low transport activity and required a longer incubation time (5 min) to achieve cellular uptake comparable with that of wild-type hCNT1 and the other mutants. In PCMBS inhibition studies, oocytes were pretreated with PCMBS (0.1 mm) on ice for 30 min and then washed five times with ice-cold transport medium to remove excess organomercurial before the assay of transport activity. Corresponding pretreatment with the MTS reagents MTSEA, MTSES, and MTSET (2.5, 10, and 1 mm, respectively) was performed at room temperature for 5 min. To demonstrate substrate protection, unlabeled uridine (20 mm) was included along with inhibitor during the preincubation step (38Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Chomey E.G. Cass C.E. Baldwin S.A. Young J.D.

Blots were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Residues Identified for Mutagenesis—In this study, we employed site-directed mutagenesis and heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes to analyze the roles of hCNT1 acidic amino acid residues. The locations of the residues selected for study are shown in Fig. 1. hCNT1 contains 51 aspartate and glutamate residues. Of these, 10 are conserved in other mammalian CNT family members and were included in the present analysis (hCNT1 residues Asp-172, Glu-308, Glu-322, Glu-338, Glu-389, Glu-413, Asp-482, Glu-498, Glu-532, and Asp-565). All but one (Asp-172) were located in the C-terminal half of the protein. In initial mutagenesis experiments, each of the 10 hCNT1 aspartate and glutamate residues were individually replaced by the corresponding neutral amino acids (asparagine or glutamine, respectively). All mutations were verified by sequencing the entire coding region of the double-stranded plasmid DNA in both directions. Except for the desired base changes, all sequences were identical to wild-type hCNT1. Uridine Uptake and Cell-surface Expression of Wild-type hCNT1 and Mutants—The hCNT1 mutant transporters were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and assayed for uridine transport activity (10 μm uridine influx, 1 min fluxes) in the presence and absence of Na+ as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Representative values for mediated uridine uptake, corrected for basal nonmediated uptake in control water-injected oocytes, are presented in Table 1. Five of the mutants (D172N, E338Q, E389Q, E413Q, and D565N) exhibited >75% of wild-type Na+-dependent transport activity and were not investigated further. In contrast, substitution of Glu-308 reduced transport activity by almost 90%, whereas mutation of E322Q, D482N, E498Q, and E532Q resulted in >99% loss of uridine transport activity. The time course of uridine uptake by wild-type hCNT1 shown in Fig. 2A demonstrates that the measured fluxes corresponded to initial rates of transport. Fig. 2A also demonstrates the absence of uridine uptake in water-injected oocytes.TABLE 1Uridine uptake by wild-type hCNT1 and mutants expressed in Xenopus oocytes Oocytes producing recombinant hCNT1 and hCNT1 mutants were incubated in transport medium with or without Na+ at 20 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Each value is the mean ± S.E. from 10 to 12 oocytes. For influx in the presence of Na+, significant differences in mediated uridine uptake (p < 0.05) compared with wild-type hCNT1 are indicated by*.Mediated uridine uptakeProtein expressionaRelative expression in the plasma membrane is from Fig. 3Na+ mediumNa+-free mediumpmol/oocyte·min-1hCNT15.0 ± 0.70.06 ± 0.01+D172N4.9 ± 0.40.12 ± 0.02NDbND indicates not determinedE308Q0.7 ± 0.1*<0.01+E322Q0.2 ± 0.1*<0.01+E338Q4.7 ± 0.60.03 ± 0.01NDE389Q3.8 ± 0.30.05 ± 0.01NDE413Q5.4 ± 0.60.07 ± 0.02NDD482N0.1 ± 0.1*<0.01-E498Q<0.01*<0.01-E532Q<0.01*<0.01-D565N5.4 ± 0.50.08 ± 0.02NDa Relative expression in the plasma membrane is from Fig. 3b ND indicates not determined Open table in a new tab Cell-surface expression of mutants E308Q, E322Q, D482N, E498Q, and E532Q was investigated by immunoblotting of purified oocyte plasma membranes using polyclonal antibodies (22Slugoski M.D. Loewen S.K.

Wild-type hCNT1 and transporters with mutations at positions 308 and 322 were present in similar amounts, indicating that these single amino acid substitutions resulted in loss of intrinsic hCNT1 transport activity without altering surface quantities in the oocyte plasma membrane. Antibody specificity was confirmed by lack of immunoreactivity in membranes prepared from control water-injected oocytes. Unlike E308Q and E322Q, very little plasma membrane immunoreactivity was detected for the transporters having mutations at positions 482, 498, and 532, indicating that the lack of transport activity was associated with reduced cell-surface expression. In a second round of mutagenesis experiments, Glu-308, Glu-322, Asp-482, Glu-498, and Glu-532 of hCNT1 were replaced by the alternative negatively charged amino acid (i.e. glutamate to aspartate or aspartate to glutamate).

https://openalex.org/W2029485246,"Angiogenesis is thought to depend on a perfectly coordinated balance between endogenous-positive and negative regulatory factors. Of these factors, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietins (Angs) seem to play an essential role. Recently, we reported the expression of the Ang-natural receptor, Tie2, in neoplastic astrocytic cells within gliomas. Because of the VEGF/Ang2 functional partnership together with the presence of Tie2 in gliomas, we hypothesized a role of Ang2 on the modulation of VEGF levels in these tumors. We examined the effect of Ang2 on VEGF expression in a panel of glioma cells, which showed that Ang2 inhibited VEGF expression at both mRNA and protein levels in Tie2-expressing cells, but not in Tie2-negative cells. VEGF promoter analysis showed that Ang2 regulated VEGF expression at the transcriptional level in relation to a decrease in HIF-1α expression and HIF-DNA-binding activity. Tie2 silencing by siRNA rescued the Ang2-mediated downmodulation of VEGF, suggesting an essential role for Tie2 in this regulatory loop. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the role of Ang2/Tie2 in the regulation of HIF-1α/VEGF expression, providing additional evidence of the intrinsic coordination that occurs among these factors during angiogenesis."
