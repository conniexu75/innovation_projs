With the use of mice carrying a deletable mutant gene, expression within motor neurons was shown to be a primary determinant of disease onset and of an early phase of disease progression. Diminishing the mutant levels in microglia had little effect on the early disease phase but sharply slowed later disease progression. Onset and progression thus represent distinct disease phases defined by mutant action within different cell types to generate non–cell-autonomous killing of motor neurons; these findings validate therapies, including cell replacement, targeted to the non-neuronal cells."
https://openalex.org/W2066213138,"The Drosha-DGCR8 complex initiates microRNA maturation by precise cleavage of the stem loops that are embedded in primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Here we propose a model for this process that is based upon evidence from both computational and biochemical analyses. A typical metazoan pri-miRNA consists of a stem of approximately 33 bp, with a terminal loop and flanking segments. The terminal loop is unessential, whereas the flanking ssRNA segments are critical for processing. The cleavage site is determined mainly by the distance (approximately 11 bp) from the stem-ssRNA junction. Purified DGCR8, but not Drosha, interacts with pri-miRNAs both directly and specifically, and the flanking ssRNA segments are vital for this binding to occur. Thus, DGCR8 may function as the molecular anchor that measures the distance from the dsRNA-ssRNA junction. Our current study thus facilitates the prediction of novel microRNAs and will assist in the rational design of small hairpin RNAs for RNA interference."

https://openalex.org/W2097490641,"Recent models from theoretical physics have predicted that mass-migrating animal groups may share group-level properties, irrespective of the type of animals in the group. One key prediction is that as the density of animals in the group increases, a rapid transition occurs from disordered movement of individuals within the group to highly aligned collective motion. Understanding such a transition is crucial to the control of mobile swarming insect pests such as the desert locust. We confirmed the prediction of a rapid transition from disordered to ordered movement and identified a critical density for the onset of coordinated marching in locust nymphs. We also demonstrated a dynamic instability in motion at densities typical of locusts in the field, in which groups can switch direction without external perturbation, potentially facilitating the rapid transfer of directional information."

Distinct variations of CCN activation with particle chemical composition were observed but played a secondary role. When the temporal variation of chemical effects on CCN activation is neglected, variation in the size distribution alone explains 84 to 96% of the variation in CCN concentrations. Understanding that particles' ability to act as CCN is largely controlled by aerosol size rather than composition greatly facilitates the treatment of aerosol effects on cloud physics in regional and global models."
https://openalex.org/W2043823247,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a critical role in the immune system as sensors of microbial infection. Signaling downstream from TLRs is initiated by the recruitment of adaptor proteins, including MyD88 and TIRAP. These adaptors play essential roles in TLR signaling, but the mechanism of their function is currently unknown. Here we demonstrate that TIRAP and MyD88 have distinct functions and describe a mechanism of recruitment of TIRAP and MyD88 to TLR4. We find that TIRAP contains a phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) binding domain, which mediates TIRAP recruitment to the plasma membrane. TIRAP then functions to facilitate MyD88 delivery to activated TLR4 to initiate signal transduction. These results establish that phosphoinositide-mediated adaptor recruitment initiates a specific signal-transduction pathway."

Here, we demonstrate that the protein kinase MST1 mediates oxidative-stress-induced cell death in primary mammalian neurons by directly activating the FOXO transcription factors. MST1 phosphorylates FOXO proteins at a conserved site within the forkhead domain that disrupts their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, promotes FOXO nuclear translocation, and thereby induces cell death in neurons. We also extend the MST-FOXO signaling link to nematodes. Knockdown of the C. elegans MST1 ortholog CST-1 shortens life span and accelerates tissue aging, while overexpression of cst-1 promotes life span and delays aging. The cst-1-induced life-span extension occurs in a daf-16-dependent manner. The identification of the FOXO transcription factors as major and evolutionarily conserved targets of MST1 suggests that MST kinases play important roles in diverse biological processes including cellular responses to oxidative stress and longevity.

Oxidative stress impacts diverse biological processes, including cell survival and aging as well as the pathogenesis of many diseases ranging from diabetes to neurodegenerative disorders of the brain (Beckman and Ames, 1998Beckman K.B.

Oxidative stress is thought to trigger alterations of gene expression that culminate in either programmed cell death or cell recovery (Chong et al., 2005Chong Z.Z. Li F. Maiese K.

However, the intracellular mechanisms by which oxidative-stress signals are relayed to the nucleus remain incompletely understood. Protein kinases play a central role in signaling to the nucleus in response to extrinsic cues including growth factors (Karin and Hunter, 1995Karin M. Hunter T. Transcriptional control by protein phosphorylation: signal transmission from the cell surface to the nucleus.Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar).

Redox-dependent signal transduction.FEBS Lett. 2000; 476: 52-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The protein kinase Sterile 20 (Ste20) was recently discovered to mediate hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death in S. cerevisiae (Ahn et al., 2005Ahn S.H. Cheung W.L. Hsu J.Y. Diaz R.L. Smith M.M.

The mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MSTs), of which MST1 and MST2 share the highest degree of homology, and the Drosophila ortholog Hippo have important functions in apoptotic cell death (Cheung et al., 2003Cheung W.L.

Together, these observations raise the question of whether MST plays a role in oxidative-stress responses in higher eukaryotes. The FOXO transcription factors induce apoptotic or adaptive responses in mammalian cells upon exposure to oxidative stress (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R.

Forkhead transcription factor FOXO3a protects quiescent cells from oxidative stress.Nature. 2002; 419: 316-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). At an organismal level, studies in C. elegans have not implicated the FOXO ortholog DAF-16 in cell death but have established a major role for DAF-16 in promoting longevity (reviewed in Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The Drosophila protein dFOXO also promotes life span, suggesting that FOXO function in longevity is conserved across evolution (Giannakou et al., 2004Giannakou M.E. Goss M. Junger M.A. Hafen E. Leevers S.J. Partridge L. Long-lived Drosophila with overexpressed dFOXO in adult fat body.Science. 2004; 305: 361Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar, Hwangbo et al., 2004Hwangbo D.S.

Drosophila dFOXO controls lifespan and regulates insulin signalling in brain and fat body.Nature. 2004; 429: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Regulation of FOXO proteins has been extensively characterized in the context of growth-factor signaling (reviewed in Burgering and Kops, 2002Burgering B.M. Kops G.J. Cell cycle and death control: long live Forkheads.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 352-360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, Van Der Heide et al., 2004Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. The ins and outs of FoxO shuttling: mechanisms of FoxO translocation and transcriptional regulation.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) induced phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) Akt kinase cascade inhibits the activity of FOXO proteins (Brunet et al., 2001Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Transcription-dependent and -independent control of neuronal survival by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). Akt directly phosphorylates FOXO proteins at distinct sites and thereby stimulates their association with 14-3-3 proteins and sequestration in the cytoplasm (Van Der Heide et al., 2004Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. The ins and outs of FoxO shuttling: mechanisms of FoxO translocation and transcriptional regulation.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Regulation of FOXO proteins by the insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is conserved from C. elegans to mammals (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, Van Der Heide et al., 2004Van Der Heide L.P.

Thus, while deficiency of the insulin-regulated PI3K-Akt signaling pathway leads to the activation of DAF-16 and thereby promotes life-span extension in nematodes, inhibition of this signaling pathway and consequent activation of FOXO transcription factors triggers cell death in mammalian cells (Brunet et al., 2001Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Transcription-dependent and -independent control of neuronal survival by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar, Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). In this study, we identify the FOXO transcription factors as evolutionarily conserved key targets of the MST family of kinases. We find that MST1 phosphorylates the FOXO transcription factors at a site that is conserved within the forkhead domain of these proteins from mammals to C. elegans. In mammalian neurons, oxidative stress activates MST1, which in turn phosphorylates FOXO3 at serine 207. The MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 disrupts FOXO3's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, promotes FOXO3 translocation to the nucleus, and thereby induces neuronal cell death. We also find that MST-FOXO signaling operates in nematodes. MST1 can phosphorylate DAF-16 at serine 196, which corresponds to FOXO3 serine 207. Knockdown of the C. elegans MST1 ortholog CST-1 accelerates aging and reduces life span. In contrast, overexpression of cst-1 promotes life span and delays tissue aging. Importantly, the cst-1-induced life-span extension is dependent on daf-16, supporting the conclusion that CST-DAF-16 signaling promotes longevity in C. elegans. Taken together, our findings demonstrate an intimate and evolutionarily conserved signaling link between MST1 and FOXO transcription factors that regulates responses to oxidative stress in mammalian cells and longevity in nematodes. We characterized a potential role of MST1 in oxidative-stress responses in mammalian cells. Primary granule neurons of the rat cerebellum provide a robust system for the study of cell death, including upon exposure to oxidative stress (Becker and Bonni, 2004Becker E.B. Bonni A. Cell cycle regulation of neuronal apoptosis in development and disease.Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 72: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We found that exposure of granule neurons to hydrogen peroxide stimulated the increased autophosphorylation of MST1/2 (Figure 1A), suggesting that the MST family of kinases is activated in neurons in response to oxidative stress. To determine the importance of oxidative-stress-induced endogenous MST1 in neurons, we employed a plasmid-based method of RNA interference (RNAi). Expression of MST1 hairpin RNAs (hpRNAs) reduced effectively the expression of MST1 in granule neurons (Figure 1B). We next transfected primary neurons with the MST1 RNAi or control U6 plasmid, and 3 days after transfection, neurons were left untreated or were treated with hydrogen peroxide for 24 hr. Exposure of control U6-transfected neurons to hydrogen peroxide robustly induced cell death. However, MST1 knockdown neurons were protected from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death (Figure 1C). These data suggest that MST1 is required for oxidative-stress-induced neuronal cell death. To demonstrate the specificity the MST1 RNAi phenotype in neurons, we performed a rescue experiment. We generated a “rescue” form of MST1 (MST1R) that is resistant to MST1 RNAi (Figure 1D). MST1R, but not MST1, significantly reduced the ability of MST1 knockdown to protect neurons from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death (Figure 1E). Thus, MST1 RNAi inhibits hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death via specific knockdown of MST1 rather than off-target effects of RNAi. We next investigated the mechanism by which MST1 promotes neuronal cell death. In S. cerevisiae, hydrogen peroxide triggers the translocation of full-length Ste20 to the nucleus, where Ste20 phosphorylates histone H2B at serine 10 (Ahn et al., 2005Ahn S.H. Cheung W.L. Hsu J.Y. Diaz R.L. Smith M.M. Allis C.D. Sterile 20 kinase phosphorylates histone H2B at serine 10 during hydrogen peroxide-induced apoptosis in S. cerevisiae.Cell. 2005; 120: 25-36Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the cytotoxic agent etoposide induces the cleavage of an N-terminal fragment of MST1 that localizes to the nucleus and phosphorylates histone H2B at serine 14 (Cheung et al., 2003Cheung W.L. Ajiro K. Samejima K. Kloc M. Cheung P. Mizzen C.A. Beeser A. Etkin L.D. Chernoff J. Earnshaw W.C. Allis C.D. Apoptotic phosphorylation of histone H2B is mediated by mammalian sterile twenty kinase.Cell. 2003; 113: 507-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). We were unable to demonstrate that hydrogen peroxide induces the nuclear translocation of MST1 or the phosphorylation of histone H2B at serine 14 in mammalian cells and neurons (data not shown). These observations raised the possibility that MST1 might couple oxidative-stress signals to the nucleus via proteins that undergo nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. The FOXO proteins transit between the cytoplasm and nucleus and mediate responses to oxidative stress including neuronal death (Brunet et al., 2004Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F. Chua K.F. Greer P.L. Lin Y. Tran H. Ross S.E. Mostoslavsky R. Cohen H.Y. et al.Stress-dependent regulation of FOXO transcription factors by the SIRT1 deacetylase.Science. 2004; 303: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (2434) Google Scholar, Essers et al., 2004Essers M.A. Weijzen S. de Vries-Smits A.M. Saarloos I. de Ruiter N.D. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. FOXO transcription factor activation by oxidative stress mediated by the small GTPase Ral and JNK.EMBO J. 2004; 23: 4802-4812Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether MST1 might mediate oxidative-stress-induced cell death in neurons via FOXO proteins. Induction of FOXO RNAi, but not of the unrelated protein Cdk2, protected neurons from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death (Figure 1F), suggesting a requirement for FOXO-family proteins in oxidative-stress-induced neuronal cell death. In other experiments, expression of exogenous MST1 in neurons induced cell death, but knockdown of FOXO proteins suppressed MST1-induced cell death (Figure 1G). Together, these results suggest that MST1 mediates oxidative-stress-induced cell death in a FOXO-dependent manner. Since MST1 is a protein kinase, we next tested whether MST1 might phosphorylate FOXO proteins. We found that MST1, but not a kinase-dead MST1 in which the ATP binding site was mutated (MST1 K59R), phosphorylated FOXO3 in vitro (Figure 2A). Upon expression in 293T cells, MST1 and FOXO3 formed a physical complex (Figure 2B). We also found that endogenous MST1, but not the protein kinase MLK3, associated with endogenous FOXO3 in cells (Figure 2C). The interaction of MST1 and FOXO3 supported the possibility that FOXO3 might be a substrate of MST1. We delineated the region within FOXO3 that associates with MST1 in GST pull-down assays using recombinant GST fusion proteins encoding five nonoverlapping FOXO3 regions (peptides P1–P5). MST1 coprecipitated only with peptide P2 (amino acids 154–259), which contains the forkhead domain (Figure 2D). MST1 robustly phosphorylated the P2 fragment but not the other FOXO3 fragments in vitro (Figure 2E). These results suggest that MST1 specifically interacts with and phosphorylates the forkhead domain of FOXO3. By tandem mass spectrometry analysis (MS/MS) aided by data-dependent MS/MS/MS (MS3), we identified four serine residues (serines 207, 213, 229 or 230, and 241) that were phosphorylated by MST1 in the forkhead domain of FOXO3 (see Table S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). These serines are highly conserved among FOXO family members and across species including vertebrates, C. elegans, and Drosophila (Figure 2F). MST1 phosphorylated the conserved sites in the FOXO1 forkhead domain in vitro but failed to phosphorylate FOXO1 forkhead-domain mutants in which serine 212 (corresponding to serine 207 in FOXO3) was replaced with alanine (data not shown). Together, these experiments demonstrate that MST1 phosphorylates the forkhead domain of FOXO transcription factors on distinct sites in vitro and suggest that one of these sites (serine 207 in FOXO3) represents the principal MST1 phosphorylation site. We raised a rabbit antiserum to specifically recognize FOXO proteins when phosphorylated at the conserved MST1 site. The phospho-FOXO antibody recognized recombinant FOXO3 that was phosphorylated by MST1 in vitro but did not recognize recombinant FOXO3 that was unphosphorylated or that was incubated with the kinase-dead MST1 K59R (Figure 2G). The phospho-FOXO antibody also specifically recognized the forkhead domain of FOXO3 (FOXO3-FD) that was phosphorylated by purified recombinant MST1 in vitro (Figure S1). We also found that the phospho-FOXO antibody recognized GFP-FOXO3 but not the serine 207 mutants of GFP-FOXO3 that were coexpressed with MST1 in cells (Figure 2H). Taken together, our results show that MST1 induces the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at the conserved site serine 207 within the forkhead domain both in vitro and in vivo. We next determined whether oxidative stress induces the MST1-mediated FOXO phosphorylation in cells and neurons. Hydrogen peroxide induced the endogenous FOXO3 phosphorylation at serine 207 in both 293T cells (Figure S2) and primary neurons (Figures 3A and 3B). In the immunocytochemical analyses in neurons, the phospho-FOXO signal was specifically competed with the phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated FOXO peptide (Figure 3B). Hydrogen peroxide also stimulated the interaction of endogenous MST1 and FOXO3 in cells and primary neurons (Figure 3C), supporting the possibility that FOXO3 might be a key substrate of MST1 in response to oxidative stress. Knockdown of MST1 in cells impaired hydrogen-peroxide-induced phosphorylation of endogenous FOXO3 at serine 207 (Figure 3D). In neurons, knockdown of MST1 or MST2, but not of the protein kinase Cdk2, reduced the ability of hydrogen peroxide to effectively induce the FOXO3 phosphorylation (Figure 3E). Taken together, these results support the conclusion that the MST family of kinases phosphorylates FOXO3 at the conserved forkhead-domain site serine 207 in cells and primary neurons upon oxidative stress. The hydrogen-peroxide-induced MST1 phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207 led us to determine the consequences of this phosphorylation event. Since MST1 interacts with FOXO3 in the cytoplasmic compartment of the cells (data not shown), we next asked whether MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 might regulate FOXO3's sequestration by 14-3-3 proteins in the cytoplasm. We expressed GFP-FOXO3 together with MST1 or the kinase-dead MST1 K59R in 293T cells. Expression of MST1, but not MST1 K59R, reduced the amount of 14-3-3 that interacted with GFP-FOXO3 (Figure 4A). These results suggest that MST1 disrupts the association of FOXO3 with 14-3-3 proteins. We next determined the role of the MST1-induced FOXO3 phosphorylation at serine 207 in the inhibition of FOXO3's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. While expression of MST1 robustly disrupted the interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with GFP-FOXO3, MST1 failed to inhibit the interaction of 14-3-3 with GFP-FOXO3 mutants in which serine 207 was replaced with alanine (Figure 4B). MST1 failed to inhibit the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 253 (data not shown), an Akt-induced phosphorylation event that promotes FOXO3's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins (Brunet et al., 2001Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E. Transcription-dependent and -independent control of neuronal survival by the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2001; 11: 297-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar). These results suggest that MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207 triggers the dissociation of FOXO3 from 14-3-3 proteins. We next characterized the role of endogenous MST in the control of FOXO3's interaction with 14-3-3 proteins in response to oxidative stress. Exposure of 293T cells to hydrogen peroxide led to a significant reduction in the association of 14-3-3 proteins with endogenous FOXO3 or exogenously expressed GFP-FOXO3 (Figures 4C and 4D). Although induction of MST1 RNAi alone had little effect (data not shown), knockdown of both MST1 and MST2 together blocked the ability of hydrogen peroxide to inhibit the interaction of 14-3-3 with GFP-FOXO3 in 293T cells (Figure 4D). Thus, endogenous MST mediates the ability of oxidative stress to trigger the dissociation of FOXO3 and 14-3-3 proteins in cells. Since 14-3-3 proteins sequester FOXO transcription factors in the cytoplasm (Van Der Heide et al., 2004Van Der Heide L.P. Hoekman M.F. Smidt M.P. The ins and outs of FoxO shuttling: mechanisms of FoxO translocation and transcriptional regulation.Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the MST-induced disruption of FOXO3-14-3-3 binding might influence the localization of FOXO3. To measure the effect of MST1 on the subcellular localization of FOXO3, we employed CCL39 cells, which are optimal for localization studies of FOXO3. MST1, but not MST1 K59R, stimulated the accumulation of GFP-FOXO3 in the nucleus of these cells (Figure S3). However, MST1 failed to induce the nuclear accumulation of the GFP-FOXO3 mutants in which serine 207 was replaced with alanine (Figure 4E). In neurons, hydrogen peroxide induced the translocation of GFP-FOXO3 but not of the GFP-FOXO3 S207A mutant (Figure 4F). These results suggest that the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207 mediates hydrogen-peroxide-induced FOXO3 translocation to the nucleus. In control experiments, mutation of serine 207 had little effect on direct binding of FOXO3 to promoter of the FOXO3 target gene bim (Figure S4 and data not shown). The identification of a signaling link between MST1 and FOXO3 that leads to the nuclear translocation of FOXO3 raised the possibility that the MST-FOXO pathway might couple oxidative-stress signals to gene transcription and cell death. The FOXO3 target gene bim encodes a BH3-only protein that directly activates the cell death machinery (Gilley et al., 2003Gilley J. Coffer P.J. Ham J. FOXO transcription factors directly activate bim gene expression and promote apoptosis in sympathetic neurons.J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide induced the expression of BIM protein in cells and neurons (Figures 5A and 5B). MST1 knockdown reduced the hydrogen-peroxide-induced expression of BIM (Figure 5B). In addition, MST1 and FOXO knockdown both significantly reduced BIM promoter-mediated transcription in hydrogen-peroxide-treated granule neurons (Figure 5C). We next determined the significance of the MST1-induced FOXO3 phosphorylation in oxidative-stress-induced neuronal cell death. Expression of an RNAi-resistant form of FOXO3 (FOXO3R), but not FOXO3 that is encoded by wild-type cDNA, reversed the ability of FOXO RNAi to protect neurons from hydrogen-peroxide-induced cell death (Figures 5D and 5E). In contrast to FOXO3R, FOXO3R mutants in which serine 207 was replaced with alanine (FOXO3R S207A or FOXO3R 4A) failed to mediate neuronal cell death in the background of FOXO RNAi (Figure 5E). In control experiments, mutation of serine 207 had no effect on the amount of FOXO3R expression (Figure 5E). These results indicate that phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207 is required for the ability of FOXO3 to mediate hydrogen-peroxide-induced neuronal cell death. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure of primary mammalian neurons to acute oxidative stress stimulates the activation of MST1 and its association with FOXO3, leading to the phosphorylation of FOXO3 at serine 207. These MST1-dependent events, which occur with rapid kinetics, in turn induce the dissociation of FOXO3 from 14-3-3 proteins and FOXO3 translocation to the nucleus, culminating in neuronal cell death. The elucidation of the MST-FOXO signaling pathway in mammalian cells led us next to determine whether this signaling connection is conserved across species. The C. elegans model system has provided important insights into the functions and regulation of FOXO proteins (reviewed in Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The FOXO ortholog DAF-16 has not been implicated in the regulation of cell death, but DAF-16 is a central positive regulator of organismal longevity (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). DAF-16 function is inhibited by the C. elegans insulin/IGF1 receptor ortholog DAF-2 (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). The entire PI3K-Akt-FOXO signaling cascade is conserved in nematodes and mammals (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar, Van Der Heide et al., 2004Van Der Heide L.P.

Therefore, while inhibition of PI3K-Akt signaling triggers FOXO-dependent cell death in mammalian cells (Brunet et al., 2001Brunet A. Datta S.R. Greenberg M.E.

J. 2004; 380: 297-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar), loss-of-function mutations in components of the DAF-2 signaling pathway, including daf-2, age-1, and akt, extend life span (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Importantly, extension of life span by mutations of DAF-2 and other components of the DAF-2 pathway occurs in a DAF-16-dependent manner (Kenyon, 2005Kenyon C. The plasticity of aging: insights from long-lived mutants.Cell. 2005; 120: 449-460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Since MST1-induced phosphorylation of FOXO3 activates its function in mammalian cells, MST orthologs in C. elegans would be predicted to promote DAF-16's ability to extend life span. To test this hypothesis, we first determined whether MST1 can phosphorylate DAF-16 at serine 196, which corresponds to serine 207 in FOXO3 (Figure 2F). MST1 robustly phosphorylated DAF-16 at the conserved forkhead site serine 196 in vitro and in cells (Figures 6A and 6B). These results are consistent with the possibility that a nematode ortholog of MST1 might promote DAF-16 function in C. elegans and thus extend life span. C. elegans contains two closely related genes that appear to represent orthologs of MST, cst-1 and cst-2 (C. elegans Ste20-like kinases 1 and 2) (Figures S5A and S5B). Transgenic nematodes that express GFP under the predicted cst-1 promoter (Pcst1::gfp) were generated. In five independent transgenic lines, Pcst1::gfp was widely expressed in epidermal cells and was accompanied by intense staining in cells in the tail, vulva, and sensory neurons in the head and weaker expression in the dorsal pharyngeal bulb (Figure 6C). To assess the function of the CST kinases in aging in C. elegans, we induced cst-1 RNAi by feeding in adult C."

In this study we report for the first time that promotion of the NAD+-dependent sirtuin, SIRT1-mediated deacetylase activity, may be a mechanism by which CR influences Alzheimer disease (AD)-type amyloid neuropathology. Most importantly, we report that the predicted attenuation ofβ-amyloid content in the brain during CR can be reproduced in mouse neurons in vitro by manipulating cellular SIRT1 expression/activity through mechanisms involving the regulation of the serine/threonine Rho kinase ROCK1, known in part for its role in the inhibition of the non-amyloidogenic α-secretase processing of the amyloid precursor protein. Conversely, we found that the expression of constitutively active ROCK1 in vitro cultures significantly prevented SIRT1-mediated response, suggesting that α-secretase activity is required for SIRT1-mediated prevention of AD-type amyloid neuropathology. Consistently we found that the expression of exogenous human (h) SIRT1 in the brain of hSIRT1 transgenics also resulted in decreased ROCK1 expression and elevatedα-secretase activity in vivo. These results demonstrate for the first time a role for SIRT1 activation in the brain as a novel mechanism through which CR may influence AD amyloid neuropathology.

Sirtuins are a family of NAD+-dependent histone/protein deacetylases that are highly conserved in their catalytic domains and are distributed across all kingdoms of life (1Blander G. Guarente L.

Nature. 2000; 403: 795-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (2788) Google Scholar). Sirtuins can deacetylate a variety of substrates and are, therefore, involved in a broad range of physiological functions, including control of gene expression, metabolism, and aging (6Bordone L. Guarente L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence implicates sirtuins in calorie restriction (CR)-mediated health effects including increased organism longevity in yeast, worms, flies, and mammals (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu.

Mammalian genomes encode seven distinct sirtuins (SIRT1-SIRT7). SIRT1 is induced by CR 4The abbreviations used are: CR, calorie restriction; AD, Alzheimer disease; AL, ad libitum; Aβ, β-amyloid; NAD+, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; NAM, nicotinamide; ROCK, serine/threonine Rho kinase; APP, amyloid precursor protein; WT, wild-type; sAPPα, soluble APP; DN, dominant negative; CA, constitutively active; H4-k16Ac, acetylated histone 4 lysine 16 residue; Ad, adenovirus; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; m.o.i., multiplicity of infection; h, human; NeuN, neuronal nuclear-specific. in several tissues and has been implicated in various effects such as stress resistance, reduced apoptosis, and metabolic changes associated with CR (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). SIRT1 is also expressed in the developing and the adult mammalian brain (7Hisahara S. Chiba S. Matsumoto H. Horio Y. J. Pharmacol. Sci. 2005; 98: 200-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on these considerations and on the evidence that CR prevents AD-type amyloid neuropathology in animal models (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 9Patel N.V. Gordon M.N. Connor K.E. Good R.A. Engelman R.W. Mason J. Morgan D.G. Morgan T.E. Finch C.E. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 995-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), we sought to test the hypothesis that CR may reduce AD-type amyloid neuropathology through mechanisms involving promotion of SIRT1. The relevance of CR treatment in experimental models of AD to human pathology is supported by recent epidemiological evidence suggesting that humans who maintain a low calorie diet have a reduced risk of developing AD (10Luchsinger J.A. Tang M.X. Shea S. Mayeux R. Arch. Neurol. 2002; 59: 1258-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar, 11Hendrie H.C. Ogunniyi A. Hall K.S. Baiyewu O. Unverzagt F.W. Gureje O. Gao S. Evans R.M.

Neurology. 2003; 60: 690-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Abnormal Aβ deposition within the brain is a hallmark of AD neuropathology. Accumulation of aggregated Aβ is hypothesized to initiate a pathological cascade resulting in onset and progression of AD (13Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Aβ species with different amino and carboxyl termini are generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolysis by β- and γ-secretases in amyloidogenic processing pathways (14Gandy S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A 1–40 amino acid form of Aβ (Aβ1–40) is the major secreted product of these cleavages, whereas the minor 1–42 amino acid form of Aβ (Aβ1–42) that contains two additional residues at its carboxyl terminus has been suggested as the initiating molecule in the pathogenesis of AD (13Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18295-18298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). In the non-amyloidogenic pathway, APP is cleaved within the Aβ domain by a third α-secretase, precluding generation and deposition of intact amyloidogenic Aβ peptides in the brain (14Gandy S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2002; 23: 1009-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CR extends the life span in a wide variety of animals and has for decades been the only lifestyle-related regimen known to promote longevity and prevent morbidity in mammals (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 2Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar, 3Smith J.S.

The recent determination that the yeast sirtuin Sir2 is required for CR-induced increases in lifespan in this organism suggests that sirtuins may play key roles in mediating CR-related health effects in other organisms (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 2Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp.

The latter hypothesis is supported by a number of recent studies showing that increasing sirtuin gene dosage promotes lifespan increases in worms and flies (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 6Bordone L. Guarente L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). In addition, studies in mammals show that sirtuins (and SIRT1 in particular) regulate stress resistance, adipogenesis/adipolysis, and metabolic responses to fasting (6Bordone L. Guarente L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). The sirtuin deacetylation reaction consumes NAD+, releases NAM, and forms a novel metabolite 2′-O-acetyl-(ADP) ribose along with a deacetylated lysine product (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NAM inhibits yeast Sir2 and SIRT1 at 50–150 μm concentrations (15Bitterman K.J. Anderson R.M. Cohen H.Y. Latorre-Esteves M. Sinclair D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45099-45107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The recycling of NAM back to NAD+ by the enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase may be crucial for maintenance of cellular NAD+ and for maintaining SIRT1 functions (1Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar, 6Bordone L. Guarente L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 298-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). Indeed, NAD+ levels in liver were recently shown to increase with fasting (16Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W. Gygi S.P. Spiegelman B.M. Puigserver P. Nature. 2005; 434: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar), and changes in the NAD+/ NAM ratio in vivo may critically influence cellular responses to CR and modulate SIRT1 activities in mammals (17Lamming D.W. Wood J.G. Sinclair D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 53: 1003-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this study we first examined if CR treatment influences SIRT1 expression/activity and the NAD+/NAM ratio in the brain and then systematically explored the causal link between SIRT1-mediated deacetylase activity and Aβ peptide generation in vitro. We report for the first time that promotion of NAD+-dependent SIRT1 deacetylase activity may be a mechanism by which a CR dietary regimen may prevent experimental AD amyloid neuropathology. Most importantly, we report that a mechanism through which SIRT1 in part prevents Aβ peptide generation is through promotion of the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP by means of inhibition of ROCK1 expression. These findings point to SIRT1 activation and enhancement of the NAD+/nicotinamide (NAM) ratio in the brain as potentially attractive pharmacological strategies for AD prevention and/or treatment. Tg2576 Mice and Diets—In this study 4-month-old female Tg2576 mice (18Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar) (Taconic, Inc., Germantown, NY) were randomly assigned to CR or ad libitum (AL) dietary regimens. CR was achieved by feeding Tg2576 mice 70% of the calories consumed by the pair-controlled AL animals, as previously reported (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). At 10 months of age, the mice were sacrificed, and brain specimens were harvested as previously reported (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). All animal studies were conducted following protocols approved by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine Institutional Animal Use Committee. Measurement of NAD+ and NAM—A weighed aliquot of frozen pulverized tissue allocated for biochemical studies (cerebellum) was extracted in 800 μl of HClO4 (1.1 m) containing 6 nmol of [18O]NAD+ (91% isotopic enrichment) and 2.5 nmol of [18O]NAM (96% isotopic enrichment). After centrifugation for 3 min at room temperature, supernatants were neutralized with KOH and injected onto a high performance liquid chromatography for separation of NAM and NAD+ from other cell components. NAD+ and NAM peaks were collected as determined by retention time of authentic standards. Samples were lyophilized, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectroscopy (MS) (positive mode) was used to detect NAD+, and ESI-MA (positive mode) was used to measure the NAM signal (19Sauve A.A. Moir R.D. Schramm V.L. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). A peak ratio of 664/666 provided quantitation of the nmol of NAD+ in a sample as determined from the 6 nmol of [18O]NAD+ added to the original sample. Similarly, NAM levels were determined using the ratio 123/125 multiplied by 2.5 nmol of NAM to obtain total nmol of NAM per sample. Both NAD+ and NAM mole contents were then divided by the tissue volume (density, 1.0 μl/mg of tissue) to obtain the metabolite concentration in tissue. The methodology employed is based upon a previous approach that measured NAM contents in yeast (19Sauve A.A. Moir R.D. Schramm V.L. Willis I.M. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 595-601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Corrections were applied for isotopic abundances, and relevant blanks and controls were also run. Each sample group contained at least four animals, and each sample was run in duplicate. Neocortical SIRT1 Immunocytochemical Localization—Neocortical tissue sections (50 μm) adjacent to those used for assessment of amyloid plaque pathology in CR Tg2576 mice were washed with Tris-buffered saline (20 mm, pH 7.4) followed by incubation with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min for permeabilization. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by incubating the sections with 0.3% hydrogen peroxide for 5 min. After a rinse with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), the sections were incubated with blocking buffer (5% goat serum in TBS) for 120 min. The sections were then incubated with primary antibodies SMI-32 (1:2000 dilution, Sternberger Monoclonals Inc., Lutherville, MD) and anti-SIRT1 IgG (1:100 dilution, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY) in blocking buffer at 4 °C overnight. The sections were washed 3 times with Tris-buffered saline and then incubated with a mixture of anti-mouse IgG Texas Red-conjugated and anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase-conjugated (1:200 dilution) antibodies in blocking buffer for 2 h at 37 °C. The specific labeling of SIRT was detected using Tyramide Signal Amplification kit (Molecular Probs™) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sections were mounted with Vectasheald, the sections were observed under either a fluorescent microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging system) or Leica TCS-SP (UV) confocal system, and images were acquired. Cell Culture and Treatments—Embryonic (E14) neocortical primary neuronal cultures derived from Tg2576 transgenic mice (Tg2576 neurons) were prepared as previously described (20Kelley K.A. Ho L.

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing human APP carrying the K670N, M671L Swedish mutation (APPswe)(a gift from Dr. Robakis) as in Tg2576 neurons were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% streptomycin/penicillin (Invitrogen), and 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). In a cell culture study, CHO-APPswe cells or Tg2576 neurons were seeded at 4 × 104 cells/cm2 and cultured at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. For adenoviral infection or pharmacological studies, Tg2576 neuronal (5 days old) or CHO-APPswe (24 h after plating), cultures were infected with wild-type (WT) SIRT1 (16Rodgers J.T. Lerin C. Haas W.

NAD+ (75 mm, Sigma) was freshly prepared and dissolved in water before use. For the constitutively active (CA) ROCK1 study, CHO-APPswe cells were transfected with pCAG empty vector or CA ROCK1 cDNA followed by infection with Ad-WT SIRT1 of Ad-lacZ 6 h later. The transfection was carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacture's instructions and as previously described (22Pedrini S. Carter T.L. Prendergast G. Petanceska S. Ehrlich M.E. Gandy S. PLoS Med. 2005; 2: e18Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Conditioned medium was collected at indicated time points for Aβ detection. Cell viability was assessed by LDH assay. Aβ Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—The quantitative assessment of Aβ peptides in brain and cultured cells was performed as previously descried (23Qin W. Ho L. Pompl P.N. Peng Y. Zhao Z. Xiang Z. Robakis N.K. Shioi J. Suh J. Pasinetti G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 50970-50977Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Western Blot Analysis—Aliquots of frozen pulverized neocortical tissue (cingular and parietal cortex) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors. Lysates were then subjected to Western blot analysis with the indicated antibody as previously reported (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used in this study: polyclonal anti-SIRT1 antibody (1:3000), polyclonal anti-histone H4 (Ac16) (1:2000, Serotec, Raleigh, NC), polyclonal antiamyloid precursor protein carboxyl-terminal (751–770) antibody (anti-O443, 1:5000 dilution, Calbiochem), monoclonal 22C11 antibody (1:1000, Chemicon International, Temecula, CA), monoclonal 6E10 antibody (1:1000, Senetek, St. Louis, MO), rabbit polyclonal antibody against ROCK1 (1:5000; Chemicon International), and polyclonal β-actin antibody (1:3000, Sigma). Secretase Activity Assays—α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities were assessed using commercially available kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as previously described (24Rezai-Zadeh K. Shytle D. Sun N.

SIRT1 Transgenic Mice—For the generation of the hSIRT1 transgenic mice, a 2.3-kilobase cDNA fragment containing the entire coding region of the hSIRT1 (a gift from Dr. Sauve) was inserted into a unique HindIII-NotI restriction site located within the second exon of the rat neuron-specific enolase gene, as previously described in this laboratory (20Kelley K.A.

A 7.3-kilobase SalI fragment containing the hSIRT1 was purified and micro-injected into 1-cell mouse eggs as previously described (20Kelley K.A. Ho L. Winger D. Freire-Moar J. Borelli C.B. Aisen P.S.

Founders were identified by PCR-based genotyping, and generation of individual F1 lines was obtained by mating founders with strain-matched C57B6-SJL WT mice for analysis of SIRT1 and ROCK1 expression and α-secretase activity. Statistical Analysis—All values are expressed as the means ± S.E. Differences between means were analyzed using a two-tailed Student t test. In all analyses the null hypothesis was rejected at the 0.05 level. All statistical analyses were performed using the Prism Stat program (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). CR Increases SIRT1 Expression and NAD+ Levels in the Brains of ∼10-Month-old Tg2576 Mice—For the in vivo studies, beginning at 4 months of age, Tg2576 transgenic mice, which model AD-type amyloid neuropathology (18Hsiao K. Chapman P. Nilsen S. Eckman C. Harigaya Y. Younkin S. Yang F. Cole G. Science. 1996; 274: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (3700) Google Scholar), were enrolled in a CR diet regimen providing ∼30% fewer daily calories relative to average caloric consumption of age- and gender-matched control AL-fed Tg2576 mice as previously described (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous evidence, CR treatment resulted in body weight stabilization over the ∼6 month study period among CR Tg2576 mice relative to the AL-fed group (supplemental Fig. 1). When mice were sacrificed at ∼10 months of age, we found a significant elevation of SIRT1 protein content (p < 0.05) (Fig. 1A) and NAD+ content (p < 0.001) (Fig. 1B) as well as a significant reduction in NAM content (p < 0.01) (Fig. 1B) in the brain of CR Tg2576 mice relative to the age- and gender-matched AL-fed control Tg2576 mice (see supplemental Fig. 2 for more information on NAD+/NAM assay). The increased SIRT1 protein content and the ∼4-fold increased NAD+/NAM ratio (p < 0.001) in the brain of CR Tg2576 mice (Fig. 1B) coincided with an apparent marked elevation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in the brain, as reflected by significantly reduced acetylation levels of the SIRT1 substrate H4-k16Ac (p < 0.05), assessed by Western blot assay using an antibody specific for H4-k16ac residue (Fig. 1C) (26Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar), relative to AL-fed Tg2576 control mice. The observed difference in immunoreactive H4-k16Ac content was not attributable to different H4 contents in the brain of CR relative to AL Tg2576 mice (data not shown). In parallel control studies we found that CR-mediated SIRT1 activation in the brain of Tg2576 coincided with reduced acetylated H3-k9Ac levels in the absence of significant changes in H4-k8Ac relative to control AL-fed-treated Tg2576 mice (data not shown). Our evidence is consistent with a previous report that SIRT1 deacetylates histone polypeptides with a preference for H4-k16Ac and H3-K9Ac (26Vaquero A. Scher M. Lee D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 93-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Based on this evidence and the fact that t H4-k16Ac is selectively influenced in the brain of Tg2576 in response to CR (Fig. 1C), we decided to monitor H4-k16Ac signaling as the specific index for SIRT1-mediated deacetylase activity in vitro (see below). The elevation in SIRT1 deacetylase activity in this study coincided with significantly decreased Aβ1–40 and Aβ1–42 peptide contents (Fig. 1D) in the same brain tissue and was accompanied by near complete prevention of AD-type amyloid neuropathology (supplemental Fig. 3, A and B). The evidence revealing CR-mediated attenuation in AD-type neuropathology in 10-month-old CR Tg2576 mice in this study, is consistent with our previous independent study showing similar responses in 12-month-old Tg2576 mice after 9 months of CR treatment (8Wang J. Ho L. Qin W. Rocher A.B. Seror I. Humala N. Maniar K. Dolios G. Wang R. Hof P.R. Pasinetti G.M. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 659-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To identify the cellular localization of SIRT1 expression in CR Tg2576 mice, we immunocytochemically surveyed SIRT1 in adjacent contralateral tissue from neocortical sections used to evaluate AD-type amyloid neuropathology. We found that SIRT1 immunoreactivity in CR Tg2576 mice (green immunostaining) was primarily localized within the boundaries of both the outer (OG) and inner (IG) granular layers of the neocortex (Fig. 1E, panel A); sparse SIRT1 immunolabeling was also detected in both outer (OPL) and inner (IPL) pyramidal layers of the parietal neocortex as reflected by co-localization of SIRT1 and SMI-32 immunoreactive signal (red immunostaining), which is a specific marker for neocortical pyramidal neurons (Fig. 1E; panel A). Similar neuronal SIRT1 immunoreactive distribution was found in the neocortex of AL-fed Tg2576 (data not shown). Further examination of cellular localization of SIRT1 in the neocortical granular layer in adjacent tissue sections revealed that the SIRT1 immunoreactive signal (Fig. 1E, panel b, green staining) selectively co-localized with neuronal nuclear-specific (NeuN) immunoreactivity (Fig. 1E, panel c, red staining) as determined by overlapping SIRT1 and NeuN staining (Fig. 1E, panel d). The selective neuronal distribution of SIRT1 protein in the neocortex and other brain regions of CR Tg2576 mice 5G. M. Pasinetti, unpublished observation. suggests that neuronal SIRT1 deacetylase may selectively influence APP processing independently from glial inflammatory-associated Aβ processing and amyloid plaque generation (27Mrak R.E. Griffin W.S. Neurobiol. Aging. 2005; 26: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Thus, despite the availability of evidence that exogenous SIRT1 expression in glia may attenuate inflammatory neurotoxicity in vitro (28Chen J. Zhou Y. Mueller-Steiner S. Chen L.F. Kwon H. Yi S. Mucke L. Gan L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40364-40374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar), CR-mediated SIRT1 responses with respect to AD amyloid neuropathology in the brain could be primarily neuronal based upon the extent to which SIRT1 localizes to these cell types in the brain. Based on this evidence we conducted a systematic series of in vitro studies to evaluate the role of neuronal SIRT1 in CR-mediated attenuation of AD-type Aβ neuropathology in the brain of CR Tg2576 mice. In particular, we investigated if the predicted attenuation in Aβ peptide content by CR in the brain can be achieved by manipulating the expression/activity of SIRT1 in primary embryonic Tg2576 cortico-hippocampal neurons (Tg2576 neurons; E16) in vitro.

https://openalex.org/W1981625060,"Protein palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification that regulates membrane tethering for key proteins in cell signaling, cancer, neuronal transmission, and membrane trafficking. Palmitoylation has proven to be a difficult study: Specifying consensuses for predicting palmitoylation remain unavailable, and first-example palmitoylation enzymes--i.e., protein acyltransferases (PATs)--were identified only recently. Here, we use a new proteomic methodology that purifies and identifies palmitoylated proteins to characterize the palmitoyl proteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Thirty-five new palmitoyl proteins are identified, including many SNARE proteins and amino acid permeases as well as many other participants in cellular signaling and membrane trafficking. Analysis of mutant yeast strains defective for members of the DHHC protein family, a putative PAT family, allows a matching of substrate palmitoyl proteins to modifying PATs and reveals the DHHC family to be a family of diverse PAT specificities responsible for most of the palmitoylation within the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1985756920,"Variation for metabolite composition and content is often observed in plants. However, it is poorly understood to what extent this variation has a genetic basis. Here, we describe the genetic analysis of natural variation in the metabolite composition in Arabidopsis thaliana. Instead of focusing on specific metabolites, we have applied empirical untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF MS). This uncovered many qualitative and quantitative differences in metabolite accumulation between A. thaliana accessions. Only 13.4% of the mass peaks were detected in all 14 accessions analyzed. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis of more than 2,000 mass peaks, detected in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the two most divergent accessions, enabled the identification of QTLs for about 75% of the mass signals. More than one-third of the signals were not detected in either parent, indicating the large potential for modification of metabolic composition through classical breeding."
https://openalex.org/W2105244370,"Vertebrate skeletogenesis involves two processes, skeletal patterning and osteoblast differentiation. Here, we show that Satb2, encoding a nuclear matrix protein, is expressed in branchial arches and in cells of the osteoblast lineage. Satb2-/- mice exhibit both craniofacial abnormalities that resemble those observed in humans carrying a translocation in SATB2 and defects in osteoblast differentiation and function. Multiple osteoblast-specific genes were identified as targets positively regulated by SATB2. In addition, SATB2 was found to repress the expression of several Hox genes including Hoxa2, an inhibitor of bone formation and regulator of branchial arch patterning. Molecular analysis revealed that SATB2 directly interacts with and enhances the activity of both Runx2 and ATF4, transcription factors that regulate osteoblast differentiation. This synergy was genetically confirmed by bone formation defects in Satb2/Runx2 and Satb2/Atf4 double heterozygous mice. Thus, SATB2 acts as a molecular node in a transcriptional network regulating skeletal development and osteoblast differentiation."

Here we show that tethering of the RITS subunit, Tas3, to the RNA transcript of the normally active ura4+ gene silences ura4+ expression. This silencing depends on a functional RNAi pathway, requires the heterochromatin proteins, Swi6/HP1, Clr4/Suv39h, and Sir2, and is accompanied by the generation of ura4+ siRNAs, histone H3-lysine 9 methylation, and Swi6 binding. Furthermore, the ability of the newly generated ura4+ siRNAs to silence a second ura4+ allele in trans is strongly inhibited by the conserved siRNA nuclease, Eri1. Surprisingly, silencing of tethered ura4+, or ura4+ inserted within centromeric heterochromatin, or some of the endogenous centromeric repeat promoters, is not associated with changes in RNA polymerase II occupancy. These findings support a model in which targeting of nascent transcripts by RITS mediates chromatin modifications and suggest that cotranscriptional processing events play a primary role in the silencing mechanism.

The assembly of heterochromatin involves an orchestrated array of chromatin modifications. In fission yeast, deacetylation of histone H3 amino termini by the class I and II histone deacetylases Clr3 and Clr6 as well as the class III NAD-dependent deacetylase Sir2 is followed by methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (K9) by the methyltransferase Clr4 to create a binding site for the Swi6 and Chp1 chromodomain proteins (Grewal et al., 1998Grewal S.I.

In addition to these histone binding proteins and histone-modifying enzymes, components of the RNAi pathway are required for heterochromatin assembly in S. pombe (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M.

In S. pombe, two effector complexes have been identified which are essential for the assembly and maintenance of heterochromatin at centromeric DNA repeats by an RNA silencing mechanism that uses the components of the RNAi pathway. Ago1, together with siRNAs that match the sequence of repetitive DNA at the outer centromeric repeats, Tas3, and the chromodomain protein Chp1 assemble into the RNA-Induced Transcriptional Silencing (RITS) complex (Verdel et al., 2004Verdel A.

The RNA-directed RNA polymerase Rdp1 is associated with two conserved proteins, Hrr1, an RNA helicase, and Cid12, a member of the polyA polymerase family, in a complex termed RNA-Directed RNA polymerase Complex (RDRC) that has RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (Motamedi et al., 2004Motamedi M.R.

The RITS and RDRC complexes physically interact in a Dicer and Clr4-dependent fashion, suggesting that both siRNAs and chromatin recruitment are required for their interaction. Furthermore, crosslinking experiments have shown that subunits of both complexes associate with chromatin as well as centromeric transcripts in a Dcr1-dependent manner (Volpe et al., 2002Volpe T.A.

Based on these data, a model has emerged in which the association of the RITS complex with chromatin and the initiation of chromatin modifications is proposed to involve siRNA-pre-mRNA base pairing as RNApII synthesizes the RNA transcript. Subsequently, RITS would recruit RDRC and histone modifying enzymes to the targeted locus, leading to the generation of additional dsRNA, dsRNA processing into siRNA, and spreading of heterochromatin. According to the above nascent transcript model, artificial tethering of RITS to a nascent RNA may be expected to result in heterochromatin assembly and silencing of the cognate gene. In this study, we show that tethering the Tas3 subunit of RITS to a modified ura4+ RNA, using the site-specific RNA binding protein λN, results in histone H3-K9 methylation, Swi6 recruitment, and silencing of the ura4+ gene. This silencing is accompanied by the generation of ura4+ siRNAs in an RNAi- and chromatin-dependent manner and requires both RNAi and heterochromatin components. The ura4+ siRNA-programmed RITS is unable to silence the expression of a second allele of ura4+ in trans unless the conserved RNAi inhibitor eri1+ is deleted. This cis-restriction of siRNA-mediated silencing in eri1+ cells suggests that S. pombe siRNAs are normally restricted to their site of synthesis by Eri1 but can act in trans to initiate Swi6 recruitment and gene-specific silencing once Eri1 inhibition is removed. Furthermore, the inability of ura4+ siRNAs to act in trans to silence the expression of a second ura4+ allele in eri1+ cells strongly sugges that Tas3-λN acts locally on nascent, rather than mature, transcripts to initiate RNAi-dependent chromatin modifications. Finally, we found that similar levels of RNA polymerase II (RNApII) are associated with ura4+ genes that were active or silenced by either Tas3 tethering or insertion within centromeric heterochromatin. Our findings suggest that, in addition to transcriptional gene silencing (TGS), cotranscriptional gene silencing (CTGS) is a major feature of RNAi- and heterochromatin-mediated silencing mechanisms. In order to test whether the association of RNAi factors with an RNA could initiate silencing of the gene from which the RNA is transcribed, we set out to individually tether subunits of RITS or RDRC to ura4+ transcripts, taking advantage of the high-affinity binding of the λN-peptide to its cognate RNA binding site, termed BoxB (Baron-Benhamou et al., 2004Baron-Benhamou J. Gehring N.H. Kulozik A.E. Hentze M.W. Using the lambdaN peptide to tether proteins to RNAs.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 257: 135-154PubMed Google Scholar). We generated a strain containing five BoxB sites in the 3′UTR of the endogenous ura4+ gene (ura4-5BoxB, Figure 1A). As shown in Figure 1B, this strain was not able to grow on counter selective 5-FOA medium, which indicates that insertion of the five BoxB sites did not significantly interfere with ura4+ expression. Subsequently, we generated cells expressing various λN-fusion proteins and tested them for ura4+ silencing on 5-FOA medium. While λN-GFP, λN-Ago1, Chp1-λN, Cid12-λN, Hrr1-λN, or Rdp1-λN showed only weak or no silencing (data not shown), Tas3-λN conferred resistance to 5-FOA. We replated the FOA-resistant cells and further propagated them in nonselective medium (Figure S1A). After this propagation step, ura4-5BoxB/Tas3-λN cells maintained silencing of the ura4+ locus with a similar efficiency to silencing observed for a ura4+ reporter gene inserted at centromeric DNA repeats (compare ura4-5BoxB, Tas3-λN and imr1R::ura4+, Figure 1B). However, silencing was lost upon replacement of Tas3-λN with Tas3, indicating that continued tethering was required to efficiently maintain ura4-5BoxB in the silent state (Figure S1B). Consistent with the 5-FOA silencing assay, Northern blot analyses revealed that Tas3-λN, but neither Rdp1-λN nor λN-GFP reduced ura4-5BoxB mRNA levels (Figure 1C). While the results described above could be attributed to either transcriptional or posttranscriptional gene silencing (TGS or PTGS, respectively), chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that tethering Tas3 to ura4+ transcripts induced di-methylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3-K9me2) and Swi6 binding (Figure 1D), demonstrating that the observed ura4-5BoxB silencing is accompanied by the recruitment of heterochromatin markers. Moreover, the Chp1 subunit of the RITS complex spread across the entire ura4-5BoxB locus over a distance of about 1.5 kb away from the 5BoxB sites (Figure 1E). In dcr1Δ cells, the association of Chp1 with ura4-5BoxB was reduced to background levels observed in cells that lacked Tas3-λN. Finally, the association of RITS with 5BoxB sites required transcription of ura4-5BoxB as replacement of the promoter and open reading frames of ura4-5BoxB with an antibiotic resistance marker abolished the association of Chp1 with 5BoxB DNA (Figure S1D). This result ruled out the possibility that the Tas3-λN fusion protein in our experiments bound directly to the 5BoxB DNA sites rather than the ura4-5BoxB RNA transcript. RNAi components are required to initiate and maintain heterochromatin at centromeres, but they cooperate with DNA binding transcription factors to nucleate heterochromatin assembly at the mating type (mat) locus (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M.

In order to test whether the RNAi pathway is required to maintain the Tas3-λN-induced silencing of the ura4+ gene, we examined the effect of deleting several classes of factors involved in RNAi-mediated heterochromatin assembly on ura4-5BoxB silencing. Deletion of the genes encoding the other two subunits of RITS (chp1+, ago1+) or any subunits of the RDRC (rdp1+, hrr1+, cid12+) disrupted ura4-5BoxB silencing (Figure 2A). These results show that the RNAi pathway is required to maintain Tas3-λN-induced silencing of the ura4-5BoxB locus, as it is the case for maintenance of heterochromatin at centromeric DNA repeats (Volpe et al., 2002Volpe T.A. Kidner C. Hall I.M. Teng G. Grewal S.I. Martienssen R.A. Regulation of heterochromatic silencing and histone H3 lysine-9 methylation by RNAi.Science. 2002; 297: 1833-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar). In addition, disruption of the Clr4 methyltransferase and the Sir2 histone deacetylase (HDAC) resulted in loss of ura4-5BoxB silencing, and disruption of Swi6, which binds to methylated histone H3, resulted in greatly reduced levels of silencing (Figure 2A). Tethered ura4+ silencing was also sensitive to the deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A but could be fully reestablished ten generations after removal of the inhibitor (Figure S1C), which suggests a requirement for NAD-independent deacetylases such as Clr3 and Clr6. These findings support a role for the assembly of a repressive chromatin structure in Tas3-λN-dependent silencing of ura4-5BoxB. The finding that RNAi is required for Tas3-λN-dependent silencing of the ura4-5BoxB locus is intriguing since tethering RITS directly to ura4+ transcripts might circumvent the requirement for siRNA-directed association of RITS with nascent transcripts. The fact that Dcr1 is essential for the association of Chp1 with ura4-5BoxB (Figure 1E) and Tas3-λN induced silencing (Figure 2A) argues against this possibility and suggests that tethering RITS to RNA induces de novo siRNA production, which is essential for robust silencing. Indeed, we observed that Tas3-λN induced the generation of small RNAs which matched the ura4+ open reading frame (ORF) and were similar in size to that observed for centromeric siRNAs (Figure 2B). To verify that ura4+ siRNAs also loaded onto RITS, we used TAP-tagged Chp1 to affinity purify RITS from cells expressing ura4-5BoxB with either Tas3-λN or unmodified Tas3. While RITS complexes from both strains contained centromeric siRNAs, only RITS purified from cells carrying Tas3-λN contained ura4+ siRNAs (Figure 2C). Interestingly, ura4+ siRNA generation was abolished in the RNAi mutants as well as in strains lacking Clr4, Sir2, or Swi6 (Figure 2D). However, while deletion of sir2+ and swi6+ reduced the levels of centromeric siRNAs, ura4+ siRNAs, induced by tethering Tas3-λN to ura4+ RNA, were not detectable in these mutant backgrounds (Figure 2D). ura4+ siRNAs may be less abundant than centromeric siRNAs in wild-type cells. We therefore cannot rule out the possibility that ura4+ siRNAs are present at low levels in sir2Δ and swi6Δ cells, which might account for the incomplete loss of silencing observed for swi6Δ cells (Figure 2A). Thus, the general requirements for the generation of tethering-induced ura4+ siRNAs mirror the requirements for the generation of centromeric siRNAs. Similar to what has been observed in multicellular eukaryotes (Hannon and Rossi, 2004Hannon G.J. Rossi J.J. Unlocking the potential of the human genome with RNA interference.Nature. 2004; 431: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar), the expression of dsRNA from a hairpin construct can induce PTGS in fission yeast by a mechanism that requires the RNAi components Ago1, Dcr1, and Rdp1 as well as the Clr4 H3-K9 methyltransferase (Sigova et al., 2004Sigova A. Rhind N. Zamore P.D. A single Argonaute protein mediates both transcriptional and posttranscriptional silencing in Schizosaccharomyces pombe.Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2359-2367Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Whether newly generated siRNAs can also silence homologous sequences in an RNAi- and heterochromatin-dependent manner in trans is unknown. Since our tethering approach results in loading of RITS with ura4+ siRNAs and efficient silencing of the ura4-5BoxB gene, we asked whether this newly programmed RITS is able to silence a second ura4+ allele in trans. To test this possibility, we generated cells containing an additional ura4+ allele at the leu1+ locus on chromosome 2 (ura4+-2). In contrast to the first allele at the endogenous locus, the second allele does not contain the five BoxB sites but has an intron in the middle of the ORF (Figure 3A). This intron allowed us to distinguish between the two ORFs at the DNA level. If siRNAs that are generated by silencing of the ura4-5BoxB allele can act in trans, we would expect these siRNAs to promote the silencing of the ura4+-2 allele. As expected from the results presented in Figure 1, Figure 2, the ura4-5BoxB allele was efficiently silenced upon Tas3-λN tethering (Figure 3B). However, cells containing both alleles were unable to grow on medium containing 5-FOA, suggesting that the ura4+-2 allele was active (Figure 3B). To determine whether in cells containing both ura4-5BoxB and ura4+-2 alleles each allele displayed a distinct chromatin state, we examined the chromatin structure of each allele using ChIP experiments. As shown in Figure 3C, the Ago1 and Chp1 subunits of RITS localized to the ura4-5BoxB allele but not to the ura4+-2 allele. Moreover, we detected both H3-K9 methylation and Swi6 binding at the ura4-5BoxB but not the ura4+-2 locus. These results indicate that in S. pombe homologous sequences targeted by RNAi can coexist in the on and off states. In C. elegans, RNAi is negatively regulated by Eri-1, an exoribonuclease that degrades double stranded siRNAs (Kennedy et al., 2004Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. A conserved siRNA-degrading RNase negatively regulates RNA interference in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Eri-1 is conserved in most eukaryotes and has a single S. pombe ortholog (Kennedy et al., 2004Kennedy S. Wang D. Ruvkun G. A conserved siRNA-degrading RNase negatively regulates RNA interference in C. elegans.Nature. 2004; 427: 645-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar), which negatively regulates RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation and reduces the levels of heterochromatic siRNAs (T. Iida and J. Nakayama, personal communication). We reasoned that Eri1 might inhibit ura4+ siRNAs from acting in trans, perhaps by reducing ura4+ siRNA levels. To test this hypothesis, we deleted eri1+ in cells that contained both the ura4-5BoxB and ura4+-2 alleles as well as Tas3-λN. Most such eri1Δ cells were unable to grow on 5-FOA medium, indicating that the ura4+-2 allele was active (Figure 4A). However, eri1Δ ura4-5BoxB ura4+-2 cells consistently gave rise to 5-FOA resistant colonies at a low frequency, which grew at higher efficiency on 5-FOA medium upon replating (Figure 4A, bottom row). These results suggested that silencing at ura4+-2 was established at a low frequency in eri1Δ cells, but could be maintained relatively efficiently after this establishment event. To determine whether silencing of ura4+-2 was accompanied by changes in its chromatin structure, we used ChIP to examine the localization of the Chp1 subunit of RITS and Swi6 with both ura4+ alleles in ura4-5BoxB ura4+-2 cells, which were either eri1+ or eri1Δ. As shown in Figure 4B, deletion of eri1+ resulted in an association of Chp1 and Swi6 with the ura4+-2 allele (∼12- and ∼2.5-fold enrichment relative to eri1+ cells). Consistent with the role of Eri1 as a general inhibitor of RNAi-mediated heterochromatin formation, we also observed a ∼2-fold increase in the association of both Chp1 and Swi6 with the ura4-5BoxB allele (Figure 4B). These results show that in S. pombe newly generated siRNAs can recruit heterochromatin proteins and initiate de novo silencing in trans, but that this trans silencing is strongly inhibited by Eri1. In S. pombe, RNAi-mediated gene silencing is associated with histone H3-K9 methylation and heterochromatin assembly, suggesting that it inhibits gene expression, at least in part, by a chromatin-dependent transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) mechanism (Volpe et al., 2002Volpe T.A.

https://openalex.org/W2132260682,"Tissue homeostasis in mammals relies on powerful cytostatic and differentiation signals delivered by the cytokine TGFbeta and relayed within the cell via the activation of Smad transcription factors. Formation of transcription regulatory complexes by the association of Smad4 with receptor-phosphorylated Smads 2 and 3 is a central event in the canonical TGFbeta pathway. Here we provide evidence for a branching of this pathway. The ubiquitious nuclear protein Transcriptional Intermediary Factor 1gamma (TIF1gamma) selectively binds receptor-phosphorylated Smad2/3 in competition with Smad4. Rapid and robust binding of TIF1gamma to Smad2/3 occurs in hematopoietic, mesenchymal, and epithelial cell types in response to TGFbeta. In human hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, where TGFbeta inhibits proliferation and stimulates erythroid differentiation, TIF1gamma mediates the differentiation response while Smad4 mediates the antiproliferative response with Smad2/3 participating in both responses. Thus, Smad2/3-TIF1gamma and Smad2/3-Smad4 function as complementary effector arms in the control of hematopoietic cell fate by the TGFbeta/Smad pathway."

We show that inverted repeat (IR) boundary elements flanking the fission yeast mating-type heterochromatin domain contain B-box sequences, which prevent heterochromatin from spreading into neighboring euchromatic regions by recruiting transcription factor TFIIIC complex without RNA polymerase III (Pol III). Genome-wide analysis reveals TFIIIC with Pol III at all tRNA genes, many of which cluster at pericentromeric heterochromatin domain boundaries. However, a single tRNAphe gene with modest TFIIIC enrichment is insufficient to serve as boundary and requires RNAi-associated element to restrain heterochromatin spreading. Remarkably, we found TFIIIC localization without Pol III at many sites located between divergent promoters. These sites appear to act as chromosome-organizing clamps by tethering distant loci to the nuclear periphery, at which TFIIIC is concentrated into several distinct bodies.

Our analyses uncover a general genome organization mechanism involving conserved TFIIIC complex. Large-scale sequencing of several eukaryotic genomes, including the human genome, has led to detailed insights of genomic content, yielding valuable information about genes and a variety of regulatory elements dispersed across genomes. A major challenge in biological research is to understand the functional organization of genomes that helps translate genetic information into different cell types during development. Epigenetic mechanisms acting at the level of DNA or chromatin packaging proteins (such as DNA methylation and modifications of histones) contribute to how genomes are organized into distinct chromatin domains and utilized in diverse chromosomal processes (Jenuwein and Allis, 2001Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Translating the histone code.Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7632) Google Scholar, Cavalli, 2002Cavalli G. Chromatin as a eukaryotic template of genetic information.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Establishment of individual domains is likely mediated by boundary or insulator elements, specialized DNA sequences separating independently regulated domains that are often marked with distinctive patterns of epigenetic modifications. These elements, known to exist in genomes of diverse species, could shield a particular chromosomal region from positive or negative signals emanating from regulatory elements embedded within neighboring regions (Sun and Elgin, 1999Sun F.L. Elgin S.C. Putting boundaries on silence.Cell. 1999; 99: 459-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Bell and Felsenfeld, 2001Bell A.C. Felsenfeld G.

Eukaryotic chromosomes are packaged into two general types of chromatin that can determine the behavior of the underlying DNA sequence. While euchromatin is typically gene-rich open chromatin, heterochromatin maintained in a condensed state contains primarily repetitive sequences and relatively few genes. Distinct patterns of histone modifications decorate euchromatic and heterochromatic domains. For example, histone H3 methylated at lysine 9 (H3K9me) is preferentially enriched at heterochromatic loci, whereas histone H3 methylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me) marks euchromatic domains (Litt et al., 2001Litt M.D. Simpson M.

Moreover, histones are hyperacetylated at active euchromatic sites but hypoacetylated at heterochromatic loci (Grunstein, 1998Grunstein M. Yeast heterochromatin: regulation of its assembly and inheritance by histones.Cell. 1998; 93: 325-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). A key feature of heterochromatic complexes is their ability to spread in cis, causing epigenetic silencing of adjacent loci (Grewal and Moazed, 2003Grewal S.I. Moazed D. Heterochromatin and epigenetic control of gene expression.Science. 2003; 301: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). However, the encroachment of heterochromatin into euchromatin is prohibited by the presence of boundary elements (Sun and Elgin, 1999Sun F.L. Elgin S.C.

In budding yeast, the tRNA gene located near the silent mating-type locus blocks the spread of heterochromatin (Donze and Kamakaka, 2001Donze D. Kamakaka R.T. RNA polymerase III and RNA polymerase II promoter complexes are heterochromatin barriers in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 520-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This tRNA gene utilizes RNA polymerase III complex and chromatin-modifying factors to prevent the spread of heterochromatin (Oki and Kamakaka, 2005Oki M. Kamakaka R.T. Barrier function at HMR.Mol. Cell. 2005; 19: 707-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), but the exact mechanism remains unknown. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe genome contains large blocks of heterochromatin at centromeres and subtelomeric regions of all three chromosomes, at tandem rDNA arrays and a 20-kilobase silent mating-type (mat) interval (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The assembly of a heterochromatic domain has been investigated in detail at the mat locus, at which the RNAi machinery and DNA binding factors independently recruit heterochromatic factors such as H3K9me and Swi6/HP1 to specific sites (Hall et al., 2002Hall I.M.

Heterochromatin subsequently spreads to the entire silent mating-type interval and is confined to this region by two inverted repeats, IR-L and IR-R, which surround the heterochromatic domain (Noma et al., 2001Noma K.

Bjerling P. Bunner C.M. Verhein-Hansen J. Expression-state boundaries in the mating-type region of fission yeast.Genetics. 2002; 161: 611-622PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, an abrupt transition of euchromatic (H3K4me) and heterochromatic (H3K9me) modifications is observed at sites coinciding with the location of IR elements (Noma et al., 2001Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Transitions in distinct histone H3 methylation patterns at the heterochromatin domain boundaries.Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Similarly, marked decreases in H3K9me and Swi6 proteins are observed at the borders of pericentromeric heterochromatic domains which are often demarcated by clusters of tRNA genes (Partridge et al., 2000Partridge J.F. Borgstrom B. Allshire R.C. Distinct protein interaction domains and protein spreading in a complex centromere.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 783-791PubMed Google Scholar, Wood et al., 2002Wood V. Gwilliam R.

Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). However, no tRNA gene flanks the right side of centromere 1 (cen1) while the left side of cen1 contains only a single tRNA gene, indicating that elements other than tRNA genes might be required to contain the spread of heterochromatin outside centromere boundaries. Mapping of heterochromatin and RNAi factors has recently uncovered two inverted repeat elements flanking the left and right sides of cen1 (IRC1-L/R) and cen3 (IRC3-L/R) whose presence coincides precisely with the sharp decreases in heterochromatin and RNAi complexes (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P.

Moreover, it is still unclear how the IR elements could function as boundaries at the mat locus. In this study, we utilize an integrated approach, combining genetic and genomic analyses, to gain insights into boundary elements at different sites across the fission yeast genome and also investigate the mechanism of the IR boundary function at the mat locus. Our analyses suggest that IRC elements surrounding centromeres serve as heterochromatin barriers, utilizing a mechanism that is distinct from the IR boundaries. The IR elements contain multiple B-box sequences, well known binding sites for the transcription factor TFIIIC required for Pol III transcription complex assembly, that are critical for boundary activity. These B-boxes recruit TFIIIC complex, but not Pol III, to the IR elements and are also required for efficient transcription of IRs by RNA Pol II. Extending this result to a genome-wide profiling analysis, we unexpectedly identified a number of sites dispersed across the fission yeast genome that are occupied by high concentrations of TFIIIC but not Pol III. We demonstrate that these TFIIIC-bound sequences are tethered to the nuclear periphery in B-box-dependent manner. Therefore, our analyses of the IR boundaries may have identified a general mechanism for genome organization in fission yeast and other systems. It has been shown recently that the boundary element at the chicken β-globin locus is highly enriched for active chromatin modifications such as histone acetylation and methylation of H3K4 (Litt et al., 2001Litt M.D. Simpson M. Gaszner M. Allis C.D. Felsenfeld G. Correlation between histone lysine methylation and developmental changes at the chicken beta-globin locus.Science. 2001; 293: 2453-2455Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), which are recruited by the sequence-specific DNA binding factor USF (West et al., 2004West A.G. Huang S. Gaszner M. Litt M.D. Felsenfeld G. Recruitment of histone modifications by USF proteins at a vertebrate barrier element.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These histone modifications are believed to counter the spread of repressive heterochromatic complexes. To test whether the IR elements at the mat locus are similarly enriched for active chromatin modifications, we performed high-resolution chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, (Noma et al., 2001Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Transitions in distinct histone H3 methylation patterns at the heterochromatin domain boundaries.Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar) comparing the distribution of the euchromatin- and heterochromatin-specific histone modifications around the IR elements. We found that the euchromatic histone modifications, H3K9ac, H3K14ac, and H3K4me, were not enriched within the IRs, but instead the increased levels of these modifications correlate tightly with euchromatic gene-containing regions outside of the IR elements (Figure 1). In contrast to H3K4me, we found that H3K9me was highly enriched at the IR elements. The level of H3K9me decreased sharply at a specific site inside the IR repeats, which suggests that the actual boundary activity is associated with certain specific sequences within the IR elements. To explore the possibility that decreased H3K9me levels might reflect the absence of nucleosomes at these border regions, we mapped the occupancy of histone H3 around the IR elements. ChIP analysis revealed no apparent change in nucleosome density around the IR repeats (Figures 1B and 1C). To identify the core sequence responsible for conferring boundary activity to IR repeats, we performed heterochromatin-spreading assay using fission yeast strains that carried a series of small deletions within the IR-R element. These strains contain ura4+ reporter gene inserted on the euchromatic side of the IR-R. Loss of IR-R resulted in spreading of heterochromatin, causing silencing of the reporter gene (Figure 2A; Noma et al., 2001Noma K. Allis C.D. Grewal S.I. Transitions in distinct histone H3 methylation patterns at the heterochromatin domain boundaries.Science. 2001; 293: 1150-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Whereas most small deletions did not affect the boundary function of the IR-R, a 500 bp deletion near the IR-R border toward the euchromatic domain resulted in heterochromatin spreading to the same extent as a complete loss of IR-R (Figure 2A). Notably, this 500 bp deleted sequence overlapped with a region in which there was a sharp decrease in H3K9me levels (Figures 1B and 1C). Sequence analysis of the 500 bp region that is critical for the boundary function of IR-R revealed the presence of five B-box sequences (Figure 2B). The B-box is a high-affinity binding site for TFIIIC that contributes to the promoter activity of tRNA genes and other small RNA genes transcribed by Pol III. TFIIIC is a highly conserved multisubunit complex consisting of two interconnected lobular domains, one of which is composed of Sfc3 and Sfc6 proteins (Huang and Maraia, 2001Huang Y. Maraia R.J. Comparison of the RNA polymerase III transcription machinery in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human.Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2675-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To assess whether the B-boxes within the IR element have a role in boundary activity, we constructed a strain carrying a B-box deletion at the IR-R (B-boxΔ). Deletion of the B-boxes resulted in heterochromatin spreading (Figure 2A), concomitant with increased H3K9me and decreased H3K4me levels outside of the IR-R (Figure 2C). We next investigated whether components of TFIIIC are localized at the IR elements. ChIP analysis revealed that Sfc6 was localized at the IR-R region containing the B-boxes (Figure 2D), while deletion of B-boxes completely abolished Sfc6 enrichment (Figure 2E). Furthermore, insertion of three tandem copies of synthetic B-boxes in IR-RΔ strain could restore TFIIIC binding and heterochromatin boundary (Figures 2F and 2G). From these analyses, we conclude that B-box sequences within the IR elements surrounding the silent mat region recruit TFIIIC components and are responsible for the boundary activity associated with these inverted repeats. The presence of B-boxes and the localization of TFIIIC at the IR elements prompted us to examine whether the IRs are transcribed. We detected at least two distinct transcripts produced from the IRs by RT-PCR assay (Figure 3A). One of these transcripts is initiated near the tail end of the IRs, where TFIIIC is bound to B-boxes. However, the second transcript, which occurred in the opposite direction (designated as the reverse transcript), is initiated from a different region near the tip of the IR elements (Figure 3B). Transcripts originating from both strands of the IRs could be detected in the middle portion of the IR element (Figure 3B, primer pair 3). RT-PCR analysis also suggested that the forward transcript might be processed as indicated by two different size RNA species (Figure 3A, primer pair 6). Indeed, sequencing showed that the shorter transcript results from splicing of an intron, which contains canonical splicing donor and acceptor motifs found in Pol II transcribed genes (data not shown; Kuhn and Kaufer, 2003Kuhn A.N. Kaufer N.F. Pre-mRNA splicing in Schizosaccharomyces pombe: regulatory role of a kinase conserved from fission yeast to mammals.Curr. Genet. 2003; 42: 241-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). TFIIIC recruitment to the B-boxes at the IRs suggested that Pol III might transcribe these elements. Surprisingly, we did not detect Pol III binding at the IR elements whereas Pol III was detected at tRNA genes (Figure 3C; see below). Furthermore, the IRs contain internal stretches of ≥5 T residues, termination site hallmark of Pol III, suggesting that Pol III is unlikely responsible for IR transcription. However, we could detect the binding of Pol II subunit, Rpb1, at the IRs (Figure 3D), indicating that despite the presence of TFIIIC at the IR boundaries, Pol II might direct transcription of these elements. To determine the effect of TFIIIC binding on IR transcription, levels of IR transcripts were analyzed in wild-type and B-boxΔ cells (Figure 3E). Since IR elements are identical in sequence, we performed this experiment using a strain that carries deletion of IR-L to specifically assay transcripts derived only from the IR-R element carrying B-box deletion. Although low levels of forward transcripts could still be detected in B-boxΔ cells, they were drastically reduced compared to wild-type cells (Figure 3E), suggesting that TFIIIC bound to B-boxes could modulate Pol II transcriptional activity at the IRs. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the deleted region occupied by the B-boxes might also contain promoter element important for Pol II transcription. Bidirectionally overlapped transcription in the middle portion of the IRs suggested that transcripts produced from these elements might be subjected to RNAi-mediated heterochromatic silencing. However, deletion of clr4, which abolishes heterochromatin and results in enhanced cenH transcripts (Noma et al., 2004Noma K. Sugiyama T. Cam H. Verdel A. Zofall M. Jia S. Moazed D. Grewal S.I. RITS acts in cis to promote RNA interference-mediated transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing.Nat. Genet. 2004; 36: 1174-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), did not affect IR transcript levels (Figure 3F), suggesting that transcription at the IRs is not subjected to heterochromatin-mediated control. To investigate whether TFIIIC might have a more extensive role in boundary function at other chromosomal regions, we performed genome-wide mapping of Sfc6, a subunit of TFIIIC. In addition, we also probed the distribution of Pol III by mapping its subunit, Rpc130. Although TFIIIC and Pol III complexes are known to control transcription of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes (Weinmann and Roeder, 1974Weinmann R. Roeder R.G.

Survey and summary: transcription by RNA polymerases I and III.Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1283-1298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), systematic mappings of both Pol III and TFIIIC complexes across the fission yeast genome have not been performed. Our analyses revealed that both TFIIIC and Pol III were enriched at the promoters of tRNA and 5S rRNA genes (Figure 4). Surprisingly, we also observed high concentrations of TFIIIC in the absence of Pol III at many sites dispersed across the genome (below). There was, on average, more than 14-fold enrichment for Pol III and more than 6-fold enrichment for TFIIIC at all tRNA genes (Figure S1), in agreement with observations in budding yeast (Roberts et al., 2003Roberts D.N. Stewart A.J. Huff J.T. Cairns B.R. The RNA polymerase III transcriptome revealed by genome-wide localization and activity-occupancy relationships.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Genome-wide occupancy profile of the RNA polymerase III machinery in Saccharomyces cerevisiae reveals loci with incomplete transcription complexes.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4118-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Similarly, Pol III was also highly enriched at all 5S rRNA genes (>12 fold), while TFIIIC was only modestly enriched at these gene loci (Figure S1). Previous genome-wide analysis of heterochromatin distribution in fission yeast genome has suggested the potential existence of boundaries surrounding the major heterochromatic domains (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To determine whether binding of TFIIIC was associated with barriers that partition heterochromatin from euchromatin, genome-wide maps of Sfc6 and Rpc130 were overlaid with previous maps of H3K4me and H3K9me. In agreement with conventional ChIP analysis (Figure 2), ChIP-chip results revealed two prominent peaks of TFIIIC enrichment at the IR elements flanking the heterochromatin domain of the silent mat interval (Figure 4B). Strikingly, the high concentrations of TFIIIC at the IRs occurred in the absence of Pol III. Our mapping revealed little or no enrichment of TFIIIC nor Pol III at the subtelomeric regions and tandem rDNA array that are also coated with heterochromatin complexes (Figures 4C and S2), suggesting that alternative mechanisms might be involved in blocking the spread of heterochromatin at these loci. However, we found high enrichment for both TFIIIC and Pol III complexes at the boundaries of heterochromatin domains associated with pericentromeric repeats, which contain clusters of tRNA genes (Figure 4D). Akin to the IR elements, the high enrichment of TFIIIC at these tRNA gene clusters may be sufficient to counter the spread of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Interestingly, at cen1, only a single tRNA gene flanks the left side of its heterochromatin domain while there is no tRNA gene flanking its right side (Figure 4D). Moreover, despite a high enrichment for Pol III at this single tRNA gene, TFIIIC was only modestly enriched, indicating that this single tRNA gene may possess only weak boundary activity and that it may need the cooperation from other nearby cis-elements to prevent heterochromatin spreading. Indeed, we have shown previously that two inverted repeat (IRC) elements flank cen1 and cen3, which might possess boundary activities (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To help uncover sequences critical for boundary function at cen1, we performed high-resolution mapping of heterochromatin- and euchromatin-specific histone modifications. As indicated by a sharp decrease in H3K9me level at site corresponding to the IRC1-L, the boundary between pericentromeric heterochromatin and surrounding euchromatic domains seems to coincide with the location of the IRC1 element (Figures 5A and 5B). The marked decrease in H3K9me levels was not due to lower H3 occupancy because active chromatin modifications such as H3K4me, H3K9ac, and H3K14ac were highly enriched at the IRC1 and its flanking sequences (Figure 5B), consistent with our earlier work showing that IRC elements are actively transcribed by Pol II (Cam et al., 2005Cam H.P. Sugiyama T. Chen E.S. Chen X. FitzGerald P.C. Grewal S.I. Comprehensive analysis of heterochromatin- and RNAi-mediated epigenetic control of the fission yeast genome.Nat. Genet. 2005; 37: 809-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To directly test whether IRC1 and tRNAphe gene are required for the boundary function, we constructed strains containing small deletions encompassing tRNAphe gene, IRC1-L, or intervening sequences. We studied the effects of these deletions on silencing of ura4+ reporter gene inserted at a region immediately centromere-distal to the tRNAphe gene to assay for the spread of heterochromatin. While deletion of tRNAphe gene (cen1LΔ#1) or surrounding sequences (cen1LΔ#2) had no measurable effect on silencing of the reporter gene, IRC1Δ (cen1LΔ#3) led to a significant increase in fraction of cells in which ura4+ is silenced (Figure 5C). This increase in silencing of the reporter gene in IRC1Δ (cen1LΔ#3) cells correlated with the spreading of H3K9me and concomitant decrease in H3K4me levels at adjoining euchromatic region (Figures 5C and 5D). These analyses suggest that IRC1 is the predominant boundary at cen1, preventing the spread of pericentromeric heterochromatin beyond its natural boundary. We next explored whether IRC1 boundary might also employ TFIIIC-based mechanism similar to the IR elements. Conventional ChIP analysis showed that Sfc6 was enriched at the tRNAphe gene, as expected, but the levels of Sfc6 were significantly lower than observed at the IRs (Figure 5B). However, we did not detect TFIIIC binding at the IRC1 (Figure 5B), suggesting that these"

Here we explored the structural features of the chaperonin cage critical for rapid folding of encapsulated substrates. Modulating the volume of the GroEL central cavity affected folding speed in accordance with confinement theory. Small proteins (approximately 30 kDa) folded more rapidly as the size of the cage was gradually reduced to a point where restriction in space slowed folding dramatically. For larger proteins (approximately 40-50 kDa), either expanding or reducing cage volume decelerated folding. Additionally, interactions with the C-terminal, mildly hydrophobic Gly-Gly-Met repeat sequences of GroEL protruding into the cavity, and repulsion effects from the negatively charged cavity wall were required for rapid folding of some proteins. We suggest that by combining these features, the chaperonin cage provides a physical environment optimized to catalyze the structural annealing of proteins with kinetically complex folding pathways."

DNA is constantly damaged by chemical and physical agents. When the damage is not repaired it can contribute to genomic instability and probably to several maladies, including cancer, cardiovascular disease, and aging (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W.

Rev. 2005; 37: 595-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Basic issues involved in the understanding of the etiology of mutation include the biochemical formation of electrophiles and oxygen radicals, characterization of their interactions with DNA, the enzymatic repair of damage, and the processing of DNA to generate permanent changes in the genetic information. In this latter regard, the enzymology of DNA replication is of considerable interest. The mutation of DNA cannot be understood only in the context of preferred base pairing, in that the free energy differences among various pairs of natural and modified DNA bases are not sufficient to explain normal or abnormal pairing (3Goodman M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10493-10495Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Thus, the major driving forces in the generation of mutations from damaged DNA are the polymerases (4Guengerich F.P. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 420-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The normal replicative DNA polymerases are the first that encounter DNA adducts, and some small DNA adducts (e.g. O6-MeG and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroG) 2The abbreviations used are: Me, methyl; Et, ethyl; Ib, isobutyl; Bz, benzyl; N2-Naph, N2-CH2 (2-naphthyl); N2-Anth, N2-CH2 (9-anthracenyl); N2-BP, N2-CH2(6-benzo[a]pyrenyl); BPDE, benzo[a]pyrene diol epoxide; dCTPαS, 2′-deoxycytidine 5′-O-(1-thiotriphosphate); PCNA, proliferating cell nuclear antigen; pol, DNA polymerase; RT, reverse transcriptase; T7-, bacteriophage DNA polymerase T7, exonuclease-deficient; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1. are processed by these polymerases, at least part of the time. However, a group of DNA polymerases first discovered in the late 1990s participates in “translesion” synthesis beyond small and large DNA adducts, although the process is, in general, less efficient and more error-prone than the reactions that replicative polymerases catalyzed with unmodified DNA (1Friedberg E.C.

Biochimie (Paris). 2005; 87: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). A case has been made that pol κ acts mainly as an “extender” of damaged DNA that has already undergone insertions opposite modified bases, as opposed to a role in misinsertion itself (20Haracska L. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16000-16005Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 25Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash L. Prakash S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Few of the studies on pol κ provide very much quantitative information about catalysis of either misinsertion as further extension. Some steady-state kinetic studies have been done, but many only report steady-state rates as percentages and cannot be converted to kcat values. Also, after applying some assumptions about the actual enzyme concentrations used, many of the rates appear to be very low. Even if valid steady-state kinetic analyses are reported, their usefulness is limited by the complexity of the polymerase catalytic cycle (27Johnson K.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 685-713Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). To obtain a better perspective on the role of human pol κ,we prepared a purified full-length enzyme and utilized this in kinetic and other studies with a defined oligonucleotide containing a G or each of eight N2-substituted Gs at the same site. Thus, the system varies only in the size of the lesion (with associated changes in hydrophobicity and electronic properties), and the results obtained with pol κ can be compared directly with corresponding studies done with HIV-1 RT and bacteriophage T7- (28Choi Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19217-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and two other human Y-family polymerases, pol η (29Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P.

Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that pol κ is particularly resilient to blockage with the larger adducts, as judged by several criteria, and that incorporation opposite the adducts is as efficient as extension.

The resulting 2.7-kb PCR product of POLK was cloned into the vector pPCR-Script Amp, and nucleotide sequencing was used to confirm the entire sequence of the coding region. The fragment containing the human POLK gene was cloned into the vector pAcHLT-B using the XhoI and NotI sites to generate a fusion tag containing six histidines at the N terminus, yielding the vector pAcHLT/HPOLK. The plasmid was co-transfected into Sf9 insect cells using BaculoGold DNA (with a BaculoGold transfection kit) to generate the recombinant baculovirus expressing human pol κ. Expression and Purification of Human DNA Polymerases— Recombinant human pol κ P3 viral stocks were used to infect 600-ml spinner flask cultures of Sf9 cells at 1 × 106 cells ml-1. The infected cells were incubated for 60 h and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C at 3 × 103 × g. Cells were resuspended in 50 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% (v/v) glycerol) containing 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and Roche Complete protease inhibitor mixture (one tablet per 50 ml). Cell debris was pelleted by ultracentrifugation for 60 min at 4 °C at 105 × g. The resulting supernatant was loaded (0.3 ml min-1) onto a 5-ml HisTrap HP affinity column (Amersham Biosciences) in an Amersham Biosciences Δkta fast-protein liquid chromatography system at 4 °C. The column was washed (at 0.8 ml min-1) with 50 ml of Buffer A containing 20 mm imidazole, 50 ml of Buffer A containing 40 mm imidazole, and then with 50 ml of Buffer A containing 50 mm imidazole. Bound enzyme was eluted with 400 mm imidazole (in Buffer A). Fractions containing pol κ were collected, diluted 5-fold with Buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol (v/v), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm EDTA), and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column (Amersham Biosciences). Unbound protein was washed from the column with 20 ml of Buffer B containing 350 mm NaCl, and pol κ was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of 0.35 to 2 m NaCl in Buffer B. Eluted fractions (0.26 ml) were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with silver staining (32Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar). pol κ was found to be eluted at 600 mm NaCl. Pooled fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter (Millipore) to a volume of 100 μl and further purified to near homogeneity using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) with Buffer B containing 150 mm NaCl. Fractions containing >95% pure recombinant protein were pooled, concentrated, and exchanged into storage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50% glycerol (v/v), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EDTA). The active enzyme concentration of pol κ was determined by the active site titration method (see below). Recombinant human pol δ was prepared as described previously (29Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Recombinant human PCNA was prepared in E. coli and purified as described (33Fien K. Stillman B. Mol.

Reaction Conditions for Enzyme Assays—Standard DNA polymerase reactions were done in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg bovine serum albumin ml-1 (w/v), and 10% glycerol (v/v) with 100 nm primer-template at 37 °C (28Choi Y.-J.

Primers were 5′ end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase/[γ-32P]ATP and annealed with template (36-mer). All reactions were initiated by the addition of dNTP solutions containing MgCl2 (5 mm final concentration) to preincubated enzyme/DNA mixtures. Primer Extension Assay with All Four dNTPs (“Run-on” or “Standing Start” Experiments)—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or modified (N2-alkylG) template, was extended in the presence of all four dNTPs (100 μm each) for 15 min. Reaction mixtures (8 μl) were quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v) (28Choi Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19217-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Products were resolved using a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) gel electrophoresis system containing 8 m urea and visualized using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX and Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Steady-state Kinetic Analyses—A 32P-labeled primer, annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, was extended in the presence of varying concentrations of a single dNTP. The molar ratio of primer/template complex to enzyme was at least 10:1. Polymerase concentrations and reaction times were chosen so that maximal product formation was ≤20% of the substrate concentration (35Goodman M.F. Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Petruska J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 83-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The primer-template was extended with dNTP in the presence of 0.05-10 nm pol κ for 5 or 10 min. All reactions (8 μl) were done at ten dNTP concentrations (in duplicate) and quenched with 2 volumes of a solution of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (v/v) (28Choi Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol.

Products were resolved using a 16% polyacrylamide (w/v) electrophoresis gel containing 8 m urea and quantitated by phosphorimaging analysis using a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX instrument and Quantity One software. Graphs of product formation versus dNTP concentration were fit using nonlinear regression (hyperbolic fits) in GraphPad Prism Version 3.0 (San Diego, CA) for the determination of kcat and Km values. Pre-steady-state Reactions—Rapid quench experiments were performed using a model RQF-3 KinTek Quench Flow Apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer/template/pol κ mixtures (12.5 μl) with the dNTP·Mg2+ complex (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after times varying from 10 ms to 2 s (or 4 s for N2-BPG-containing DNA). Reaction products were mixed with 450 μl of formamide-dye solution (20 mm EDTA, 95% formamide (v/v), 0.5% bromphenol blue (w/v), and 0.05% xylene cyanol (w/v)) and separated using a denaturing electrophoresis gel, with quantitation as described for the steady-state reactions. Pre-steady-state experiments were fit with the burst equation y = A(1 - e-kpt) + ksst, where y = concentration of product, A = burst amplitude, kp = pre-steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation, t = time, and kss = steady-state rate of nucleotide incorporation (not normalized for enzyme concentration in the equation) (36Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 37Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), using nonlinear regression analysis in GraphPad Prism Version 3.0. Phosphorothioate Analysis—With the 32P-primer annealed to either an unmodified or adducted template, reactions were initiated by rapid mixing of 32P-primer/template/pol κ mixtures (12.5 μl) with (Sp)-dCTPαS·Mg2+ complex (or dCTP·Mg2+) (10.9 μl) and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after reaction times varying from 10 ms to 2 s (or 4 s for N2-BPG-containing DNA). Products were analyzed as described for the pre-steady-state reactions (see above). Active Site Titration and Determination of KdDNA—TheKdDNA for productive binding of pol κ to 24-mer/36-mer DNA substrates was determined using pre-steady-state analysis. pol κ (preincubated with increasing concentrations of the DNA substrate in sample syringe A) was mixed with a saturating concentration of dCTP·Mg2+, from sample syringe B, and then quenched with 0.3 m EDTA after a time interval of 0.2 s. A graph of the burst amplitude versus total DNA concentration was plotted and fit to a quadratic equation, A = 0.5(Kd + Et + Dt) - [0.25(Kd + Et + Dt)2 - EtDt]1/2, where A = burst amplitude, Et = active enzyme concentration, Dt = DNA concentration, and Kd = equilibrium dissociation constant for productive DNA binding (36Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 37Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) in GraphPad Prism Version 3.0. Determination of KddCTP—KddCTP was estimated by performing pre-steady-state reactions at different dNTP concentrations with reaction times varying from 10 ms to 2 s. A graph of the burst rate (kobs) versus dCTP concentration was fit to the hyperbolic equation kobs = [kpol[dNTP]/([dNTP] + Kd)], where kpol = maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation and KddCTP = equilibrium dissociation constant for dCTP (36Patel S.S. Wong I. Johnson K.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 511-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 37Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Overall Strategy—The goal of the research was to characterize the interactions of pol κ with damaged DNA and compare these with other human translesion DNA polymerases, particularly pols η and ι. Full-length human pol κ was prepared (see “Experimental Procedures” and Supplemental Fig. S1) and used in a series of quantitative steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic measurements with a set of oligonucleotides in which a single G was substituted at the N2 atom with a series of adducts varying only in size (Table 1 and Fig. 1). Thus, the only variable involved in this comparison is the adduct size (although the electronic properties and hydrophobicity (30Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) of alkyl and aryl groups should not be ignored, in the context of base stacking (4Guengerich F.P. Chem. Rev. 2006; 106: 420-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar)). Similar studies have been done with the replicative DNA polymerases HIV-1 RT and bacteriophage pol T7 (exo-) (28Choi Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19217-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and human pol η (29Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and pol ι (30Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and comparison of the properties of these three major human translesion DNA polymerases is now possible. Primer Extension by Human pol κ Using All Four dNTPs— The first set of studies involved extension of the primer in the presence of all four dNTPs when paired with a template containing either a G or an N2-alkylG (fixed incubation time and varying concentrations of pol κ) (Fig. 2). Although PCNA has been reported to stimulate pol κ activity (38Haracska L. Unk I. Johnson R.E. Phillips B.B. Hurwitz J. Prakash L. Prakash S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2002; 22: 784-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), it was only apparent in the presence of other accessory factors, i.e. replication factor C and replication protein A, with long and end-closed DNA templates (e.g. M13 circular template or 75-mer templates containing biotin-streptavidin complex at both ends), suggesting the different mechanism of stimulation (from pol δ, which can be stimulated by PCNA only). Gerlach et al. (10Gerlach V.L. Feaver W.J. Fischhaber P.L. Friedberg E.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 92-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) did not observe direct stimulation nor did we in the preliminary experiments with these adducts, and subsequent experiments were done without PCNA. The N2-alkylG adducts caused some retardation of extension but relatively little compared with HIV-1 RT, pol T7-, and human pols η and ι (28Choi Y.-J. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19217-19229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 29Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 72-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 30Choi J.-Y. Guengerich F.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 12315-12324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). With the highest concentration of pol κ, all of the primers were extended to mostly 34-mers and some full-length 36-mer products with the N2-AnthG template; even with N2-BPG about one-half of the primer was similarly extended. Generally the accumulation of products with only one base inserted was relatively low. Steady-state Kinetics of dNTP Incorporation by pol κ Opposite G and N2-G Adducts—Preliminary analyses with single dNTPs indicated that dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP were inserted opposite all of the N2-alkylG adducts and dATP was not. Steady-state kinetic analyses were done with varying concentrations of dCTP, dTTP, and dGTP under conditions that favor only the incorporation of a single base and the oligomer substrate is not depleted (Table 2). One possibility that cannot be dismissed, in the absence of sequence analysis of larger products, is that the (limited) dGTP insertion occurs opposite the C base 5′ to the adduct (Table 1).TABLE 2Steady-state kinetic parameters for one-base incorporation by human pol κTemplatedNTPKmkcatkcat/KmfμMs–1mM–1s–1Misinsertion ratioGC8.4 ± 0.90.31 ± 0.01371G1300 ± 3000.036 ± 0.0030.0280.0008T6800 ± 7000.38 ± 0.020.0560.0015N2-MeGC11 ± 0.70.13 ± 0.01121G700 ± 600.044 ± 0.0010.0630.0053T6000 ± 10000.29 ± 0.030.0480.0041N2-EtGC22 ± 20.36 ± 0.01161G860 ± 1600.023 ± 0.0020.0270.0016T1600 ± 6000.15 ± 0.030.0940.0057N2-IbGC11 ± 10.66 ± 0.01601G330 ± 600.027 ± 0.0010.0820.0014T1600 ± 6000.17 ± 0.040.110.0018N2-BzGC6.2 ± 0.50.38 ± 0.01611G220 ± 200.12 ± 0.0010.550.0090T410 ± 800.045 ± 0.0030.110.0018N2-NaphGC11 ± 10.27 ± 0.01251G460 ± 900.087 ± 0.0060.190.0078T870 ± 1400.17 ± 0.010.200.0082N2-AnthGC47 ± 90.24 ± 0.015.11G320 ± 600.0017 ± 0.00010.00530.0010T890 ± 1600.0080 ± 0.00070.00890.0017N2-BPGC32 ± 30.045"
https://openalex.org/W2085441698,"Mutation induction in directly exposed cells is currently regarded as the main component of the genetic risk of ionizing radiation for humans. However, recent data on the transgenerational increases in mutation rates in the offspring of irradiated parents indicate that the genetic risk could be greater than predicted previously. Here, we have analysed transgenerational changes in mutation rates and DNA damage in the germline and somatic tissues of non-exposed first-generation offspring of irradiated inbred male CBA/Ca and BALB/c mice. Mutation rates at an expanded simple tandem repeat DNA locus and a protein-coding gene (hprt) were significantly elevated in both the germline (sperm) and somatic tissues of all the offspring of irradiated males. The transgenerational changes in mutation rates were attributed to the presence of a persistent subset of endogenous DNA lesions (double- and single-strand breaks), measured by the phosphorylated form of histone H2AX (γ-H2AX) and alkaline Comet assays. Such remarkable transgenerational destabilization of the F1 genome may have important implications for cancer aetiology and genetic risk estimates. Our data also provide important clues on the still unknown mechanisms of radiation-induced genomic instability."

https://openalex.org/W2121139898,"In competent Bacillus subtilis, the ComG proteins are required to allow exogenous DNA to access to membrane-bound receptor ComEA during transformation. Here we describe a multimeric complex containing the pilin-like protein ComGC. Due to similarities to the type 4 pilus and the type 2 secretion system pseudopilus, we have tentatively named it the “competence pseudopilus.” The ComGC multimer is released from cells upon digestion of the cell wall with lysozyme and has a heterogeneous size, estimated to range between 40 and 100 monomers, covalently linked by disulfide bonds. We determined that the prepilin peptidase ComC, the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase pair BdbDC, and all seven ComG proteins are necessary to form the pseudopilus. Furthermore, these proteins are also sufficient to form a functional complex, i.e. able to facilitate binding of exogenous DNA to ComEA. The initial steps of pseudopilus biogenesis include the processing of ComGC in the cytoplasmic membrane and consist of two independent events, proteolytic cleavage by ComC and formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond by BdbDC. The other ComG proteins are required to assemble the mature ComGC monomers in the membrane into a multimeric complex proposed to span the cell envelope. We discuss the possible role of the competence pseudopilus in DNA binding and uptake during transformation. In competent Bacillus subtilis, the ComG proteins are required to allow exogenous DNA to access to membrane-bound receptor ComEA during transformation. Here we describe a multimeric complex containing the pilin-like protein ComGC. Due to similarities to the type 4 pilus and the type 2 secretion system pseudopilus, we have tentatively named it the “competence pseudopilus.” The ComGC multimer is released from cells upon digestion of the cell wall with lysozyme and has a heterogeneous size, estimated to range between 40 and 100 monomers, covalently linked by disulfide bonds. We determined that the prepilin peptidase ComC, the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase pair BdbDC, and all seven ComG proteins are necessary to form the pseudopilus. Furthermore, these proteins are also sufficient to form a functional complex, i.e. able to facilitate binding of exogenous DNA to ComEA. The initial steps of pseudopilus biogenesis include the processing of ComGC in the cytoplasmic membrane and consist of two independent events, proteolytic cleavage by ComC and formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond by BdbDC. The other ComG proteins are required to assemble the mature ComGC monomers in the membrane into a multimeric complex proposed to span the cell envelope. We discuss the possible role of the competence pseudopilus in DNA binding and uptake during transformation. Genetically competent bacteria are able to take up exogenous DNA and undergo transformation. In the Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, the development of competence is a finely regulated process, requiring the expression of the transcriptional regulator ComK, which leads to the expression of the late competence proteins, involved in the binding, uptake, and processing of transforming DNA (1van Sinderen D. Luttinger A. Kong L. Dubnau D. Venema G. Hamoen L. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 2Hamoen L.W. Venema G. Kuipers O.P. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Several late competence proteins from B. subtilis have been identified and characterized (3Chen I. Dubnau D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). ComEA is a membrane-bound DNA-binding protein (4Provvedi R. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), required both for DNA binding and transport (5Inamine G.S. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3045-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In addition, all seven genes contained in the comG operon are necessary for DNA binding (6Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and it is thought that the ComG proteins allow exogenous DNA to contact its receptor ComEA (4Provvedi R. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 271-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The ComG proteins share similarities with those involved in the formation of type 4 pili and in type 2 secretion from Gram-negative organisms. ComGA belongs to the family of traffic NTPases; ComGB is a conserved protein with several membrane-spanning domains; ComGF is predicted to be an integral membrane protein; ComGC, -GD, -GE, and -GG are similar to type 4 pilins. Pilin-like proteins are required for type 2 secretion, but because they were not known to form a pilus, they have been called “pseudopilins” (7Pugsley A.P. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 50-108Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a term we have adopted here for ComGC, -GD, -GE, and -GG. The competence pseudopilins are made as precursors and undergo proteolytic cleavage by the prepilin peptidase ComC, also required for translocation of ComGC across the membrane (8Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein disulfide oxidoreductase pair BdbDC is needed for the stability of the pilin-like protein ComGC in the membrane (9Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6994-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), probably by catalyzing the formation of the intramolecular disulfide bond in ComGC (10Chung Y.S. Breidt F. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Type 4 pilins assemble into pili, long polymeric fibers that function in bacterial adhesion and motility (11Craig L. Pique M.E. Tainer J.A. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 363-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, secretion pseudopilins can also form pilus-like structures, presumably elongated versions of the complexes functioning in secretion, i.e. secretion pseudopili (12Sauvonnet N. Vignon G. Pugsley A.P. Gounon P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 13Durand E. Bernadac A. Ball G. Lazdunski A. Sturgis J.N. Filloux A. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2749-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A pilus-like structure formed by the competence pseudopilins has been proposed (14Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 233-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), but no experimental evidence for such structure is available so far. Here we report that the major pseudopilin in B. subtilis, ComGC, forms a high molecular weight multimeric complex, covalently linked by disulfide bonds. By analogy with the pseudopilus of type 2 secretion systems, we have tentatively named it the “competence pseudopilus.” Strain Construction, Growth, and Transformation Assay—B. subtilis strains used in this work were derived from strain BD630 (hisA1 leu-8 metB5) and are listed in Table 1. Most strains contain the gene comS in a multicopy plasmid, which results in a higher proportion of competent cells in the population (15Hahn J. Luttinger A. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Strains were routinely grown through the competence regimen (16Albano M. Hahn J. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3110-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). For strains with inducible promoters, 1 mm IPTG 3The abbreviations used are: IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. or 1% xylose were added to the medium. To measure transformation frequency, cells grown through the competence regimen were transformed with DNA from a leu+ strain (BD170) and selected for leucine prototrophy.TABLE 1Strains used in this workStrain numberRelevant genotypeReferenceBD2528pUB110-comS, or multicopy comS (mcS)15Hahn J.

Roggiani M. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 3601-3605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for comC and bdbDC, or pSuperSPAC, a kind gift from David Rudner, for comG. These constructs were used for Campbell-like integration at the native loci of the aforementioned genes. Expression of inducible comEA was achieved from an ectopic locus, amyE, under the control of the xylose-inducible promoter pxylA (15Hahn J. Luttinger A. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 21: 763-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These constructs were introduced into B. subtilis strain BD630 and combined to obtain the strains described above, with comK moved in at the last step. Mutagenesis of comGC to substitute the cysteine residues by serine was performed by overlapping PCR (18Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6833) Google Scholar). The mutated genes were ectopically expressed from the amyE locus, using the comG promoter as previously described (6Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To assess transformability, the constructs were moved by transduction into a strain containing an in-frame deletion within comGC, BD2788 (19Breitling R. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1499-1508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblot analysis of the mutant ComGC forms, a complete knock-out of the comG operon was moved in. All constructs generated by PCR were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Details on the constructions are provided in the Supplemental Material. Preparation of Subcellular Fractions and Immunoblotting—Cells grown through the competence regimen were harvested and resuspended in protoplast buffer (25% sucrose, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2) with 200 μg/ml lysozyme. Usually, a 10-ml culture was resuspended in 500 μl of protoplast buffer. After 30–45 min at 37 °C, protoplasts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min, and the protoplast supernatant was carefully removed. For membrane protein preparations, protoplasts were osmotically lysed by resuspension in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, with DNase I, RNase, and protease inhibitors. After 10 min at room temperature, membrane vesicles were pelleted for 20 min at 16,000 × g, and membrane proteins were extracted for 1 h at room temperature with 1% Triton X-100 in 100 μl of the same buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature, and the supernatant containing solubilized membrane proteins was transferred to a new tube. Protein concentration was measured using the BCA assay (Pierce). For SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analyses of protoplast supernatant preparations, 10 or 20 μl were loaded on 12.5% acrylamide gels in Tris-Tricine buffer (20Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10479) Google Scholar). For immunoblots of membrane proteins, 16% acrylamide gels were used, and different amounts of protein were loaded, as indicated in the figure legends. To reduce samples, 20 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 5 mm dithiothreitol were used. After SDS-PAGE, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters, probed with anti-ComGC rabbit antiserum, and detected by chemiluminescence. Analytical Gel-Filtration Chromatography—Sephacryl S-500HR (GE Health Sciences) was equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.3 m NaCl and packed into a 50-× 1.5-cm column, with 1 ml/min flow at room temperature. These same conditions were used for calibration and analytical runs. The total volume (Vt), including column and tubing, was 90.5 ml. The void volume (Vo) was 30 ml, determined by injection of fixed bacteria. For calibration of the column, the following proteins were used as standards (with their Stokes radii and Ve, mean elution volumes from two measurements): aldolase (4.8 nm and 73 ml), catalase (5.2 nm and 69.5 ml), ferritin (6.1 nm and 66.5 ml), thyroglobulin (8.5 nm and 62.5 ml), IgM (12.5 nm and 58.5 ml), and myosin (20 nm and 31.5 ml). For each protein, Kav was calculated from the equation Kav = (Ve − Vo)/(Vt − Vo). The Stokes radius of the ComGC complex was determined by interpolation using a calibration curve constructed by plotting the Stokes radii of the standard proteins versus (–log Kav)1/2. For analytical assays, 1 ml of protoplast supernatant was loaded into the column, and 6-ml fractions were collected, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed for the presence of ComGC by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For chromatography under reducing conditions, the column was equilibrated and run with 2 mm dithiothreitol added to the buffer. Sucrose Gradient Ultracentrifugation—Protoplast supernatant preparations were diluted to 12.5% sucrose in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.3 m NaCl, and loaded on top of a 12-ml isokinetic 15–45% sucrose gradient in the same buffer. Samples were run for 7 h at 37,000 rpm in a SW41 rotor at room temperature; 1-ml fractions were collected from the top, precipitated with trichloroacetic acid, and analyzed for the presence of ComGC by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. The sedimentation coefficient of the ComGC complex was determined by interpolation using a calibration curve, constructed with proteins standards run in the same way; protein concentration in the fractions were measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The protein standards (and their sedimentation coefficient values) were aldolase (7.3 S), catalase (11.3 S), and thyroglobulin (19 S). Estimation of Molecular Weight—The values for Stokes radius (Rs, in nanometers) and sedimentation coefficient (s, in Svedberg units, 10−13 S) obtained experimentally were used to estimate the molecular weight of the ComGC complex in the protoplast supernatant, as previously described (21Siegel L.M. Monty K.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1966; 112: 346-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1547) Google Scholar), with the equation, M = 6πηNsRs/(1 − νρ), where M is molecular mass, η is the viscosity of the medium (η = 0.01 g/(cm·s)), ν is the partial specific volume of the protein (ν = 0.73 cm3/g), ρ is the density of the medium (ρ = 1 g/ml), and N is Avogadro's number, leading to, M = 4.2 × s × Rs (in kilodaltons). DNA Binding Assay—A 2.5-kb DNA fragment was radiolabeled by PCR with [α-32P]dCTP, with specific activity of ∼5 × 106 cpm/μg of DNA. Cells (∼1.0 × 109 colony forming units) were incubated with 1 μg/ml DNA for 15 min at 37 °C. The cells were centrifuged, washed three times with 1× Spizizen salts (22Anagnostopoulos C. Spizizen J. J. Bacteriol. 1961; 81: 741-746Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and cell-associated DNA was measured in a scintillation counter. The Pilin-like Protein ComGC Forms a Polymeric Complex—It was previously shown that the pilin-like protein ComGC can be found in membrane fractions as well as associated with the cell wall (10Chung Y.S. Breidt F. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The latter form is released from the cells by lysozyme treatment, resulting in formation of protoplasts. When the protoplasts are removed by centrifugation, ComGC is found in the protoplast supernatant fraction. By immunoblot analysis of ComGC in this fraction, several bands forming a “ladder” pattern could be observed under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 1, left panel). The predicted molecular mass of mature ComGC is 10.3 kDa, thus each band corresponds to monomer and higher molecular weight forms of ComGC (dimer, trimer, tetramer, and so on). A significant amount of ComGC signal was at the top part of the gel, not resolved into individual bands. All higher forms collapsed into a single band (corresponding to ComGC monomer) when the samples were treated with reducing agents. These results indicate that ComGC forms high molecular weight multimers, stabilized by the presence of disulfide bonds between the monomers under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE. The amino acid sequence of mature ComGC contains two cysteine residues, and these could participate in formation of such intermolecular bonds. The multimeric forms of ComGC can also be observed in protoplast supernatant fractions from cells treated with N-ethylmaleimide (not shown), an alkylating agent that attacks free cysteine residues. This demonstrates that the intermolecular disulfide bonds occur in vivo and are not artifactual. In Fig. 1, the monomer bands in the lanes with and without added reductant show slightly different mobilities. This could be due to the presence of an intramolecular disulfide bond in the protoplast supernatant monomer. When the protoplast fraction was analyzed by immunoblotting, only the band corresponding to ComGC monomer was observed (Fig. 1, right panel). However, there is a clear increase in the intensity of the signal upon reduction of the samples, suggesting that multimeric ComGC remains associated to the protoplasts. Bands corresponding to higher forms could not be seen in the protoplast fraction nor in whole cell extracts (not shown), perhaps due to the abundance of other proteins that could interfere with immunodetection. The ComGC Complex Has a High Molecular Weight—The SDS-PAGE/immunoblot results shown above indicate that the ComGC multimer released from protoplasts is heterogeneous, with high molecular weight forms (Fig. 1). These characteristics were confirmed by experiments performed under native conditions. By analytical gel filtration, we determined the Stokes radius of the ComGC complex to range from 4 to 25 nm, with the bulk of the material between 5.5 and 11.7 nm (Fig. 2A). The elution profile of ComGC did not change when gel-filtration chromatography was performed under reducing conditions (not shown), suggesting that protein-protein interactions other than disulfide bonds contribute to the structure of the released ComGC complex. It should be noted that these non-covalent interactions would be disrupted under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE. By ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, ComGC could be found in almost all fractions along the sucrose gradient column. Most of the ComGC signal was present in fractions corresponding to particles with sedimentation coefficient between 15 and 20.6 S (Fig. 2B), although some material was found at the bottom of the gradient (fraction 12), presumably precipitated. Both in gel-filtration and sucrose gradient analyses, the wide distribution of ComGC among the fractions points toward the polydisperse nature of the ComGC complex released from the cells by lysozyme treatment. These two experimentally obtained hydrodynamic parameters, Stokes radius and sedimentation coefficient, were used to estimate the molecular weight of the ComGC complex, resulting in a range of 400–1000 kDa. This is roughly equivalent to 40–100 subunits. Such a complex is evocative of supramolecular structures formed by orthologs of ComGC, the type 4 pilus and the type 2 secretion pseudopilus. In light of these similarities, we tentatively propose the term competence pseudopilus for the ComGC complex, although the full validation of this term awaits fuller characterization of the structure of the complex. We will refer to the fraction released from the cells by lysozyme as the pseudopilus, although this may be a broken or incomplete structure, as suggested by the multimeric ComGC associated with the protoplasts (Fig. 1, right column). Genetic Requirements for ComGC Complex Formation—We asked which competence factors are necessary to form the competence pseudopilus. ComGC is initially synthesized as a precursor, and is cleaved by the prepilin peptidase ComC (8Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ComGC is also oxidized (10Chung Y.S. Breidt F. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 905-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), presumably by the action of the putative protein oxidoreductase pair BdbDC (9Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6994-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As expected, mutations in either comC or bdbDC abrogated formation of the ComGC complex (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the products of late competence operons comE and comF, necessary for DNA binding/uptake (23Hahn J. Inamine G. Kozlov Y. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Londoño-Vallejo J.A. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 9: 119-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), are dispensable for formation of the pseudopilus (Fig. 3A). The comG operon contains the gene for ComGC and six other open reading frames, each of which is required for DNA binding and transformation (6Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Non-polar mutations in any of the other comG genes result in the absence of multimeric ComGC from the protoplast supernatant (Fig. 3B, upper panel), and only the band corresponding to ComGC monomer could be detected, in amounts that varied from experiment to experiment. A point mutation in the Walker A motif of ComGA eliminates transformation (25Haijema B.J. Hahn J. Haynes J. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 40: 52-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and results in the absence of complexed ComGC from the protoplast supernatant, indicating that the ATP-binding site of ComGA is required to form the pseudopilus. Upon longer exposures, a faint ladder pattern could be detected in immunoblots of comGD, -GE, and -GF mutants (not shown); in fact, these strains also exhibit residual transformation, albeit at least 10,000-fold less than a wild-type strain. Because the mutations in comGD, -GE, and -GF are small in-frame internal deletions (6Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 41-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that the truncated proteins have residual activity, allowing formation of pseudopilus; alternatively, the requirement for these proteins to assemble the pseudopilus may not be absolute. The mutants in the comG genes seemed to accumulate ComGC in the membrane (Fig. 3B, lower panel), which is consistent with the failure to translocate ComGC to the cell wall. Processing of ComGC at the Membrane: Cleavage and Oxidation—ComGC is cleaved by the prepilin peptidase ComC (8Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), whereas formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond is presumably catalyzed by BdbDC (9Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6994-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Both BdbD and BdbC are predicted to reside in the membrane: BdbD is similar to E. coli DsbA, and BdbC has similarity to DsbB. In the absence of either BdbD or BdbC, the amount of ComGC in the membrane is reduced, presumably due to the instability of the non-oxidized form (9Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6994-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have investigated these processing steps of ComGC in more detail. The transformation deficiency of a mutant lacking BdbC can be partially rescued by treatment with oxidizing agents: the addition of l-cystine to cells increased the transformation frequency of a bdbC strain up to 100-fold (Fig. 4A). On the other hand, l-cystine had a much less pronounced impact on transformation frequencies of strains lacking BdbD, or both BdbD and BdbC (Fig. 4A). Another oxidizing agent, oxidized glutathione, had similar effects (not shown). These results support the role of BdbDC as a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase pair: BdbD must be oxidized to catalyze the oxidation of ComGC. As a result of this reaction, BdbD becomes reduced and has to interact with BdbC to be re-oxidized. It appears that, in the absence of BdbC, re-oxidation of BdbD can be artificially achieved by oxidizing agents. Such substances are presumably also able to oxidize ComGC directly, albeit with lower efficiency than BdbD, resulting in the small increase in transformation frequencies seen in the bdbD or bdbDC mutants. We substituted the cysteine residues with serine (C41S and/or C81S), generating ComGC variants incapable of forming the internal disulfide bond. The mutated ComGC forms do not support transformation, and no ComGC complex could be detected in the supernatant (not shown). Furthermore, the mutated proteins are much less abundant in membrane fractions than wild-type ComGC (Fig. 4B). Note that different amounts of protein were loaded in the gels to permit visualization of the mutant ComGC forms. The result with the C41/81S double mutant rules out the possibility that the presence of an unpaired thiol leads to ComGC instability. The instability of the cysteine mutants is consistent with the notion that oxidation of ComGC is necessary to achieve a stable conformation. Because the cleavage and oxidation of ComGC both occur in the membrane, we asked whether these processing events occur in some obligatory order, or are independent. To approach this problem, we analyzed membrane fractions for the amount and cleavage states of ComGC in the wild-type and various mutant strains. We first asked whether ComC required oxidized ComGC as a substrate. ComGC C41/81S cannot be oxidized but is nevertheless cleaved by ComC, as demonstrated by the shift in its migration when comC is eliminated by mutation (Fig. 4B). We conclude that the ComC peptidase can cleave unoxidized ComGC. We next asked the converse question: can the BdbDC oxidoreductase act on uncleaved ComGC? For this, we compared the strength of ComGC signals in immunoblots of membrane fractions prepared from wild-type, comC, bdbDC, and double mutant comC bdbDC strains (Fig. 4C). As noted previously (9Meima R. Eschevins C. Fillinger S. Bolhuis A. Hamoen L.W. Dorenbos R. Quax W.J. van Dijl J.M. Provvedi R. Chen I. Dubnau D. Bron S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6994-7001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), when bdbDC was inactivated, the amount of ComGC was drastically reduced (Fig. 4C, left panel), indicating that unoxidized ComGC is improperly folded and subject to degradation in the membrane. In contrast, inactivation of comC alone resulted in the accumulation of the pre-ComGC, presumably due to the failure of unprocessed protein to translocate out of the membrane (8Chung Y.S. Dubnau D. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutation of bdbDC in the comC background decreased the amount of pre-ComGC, indicating that oxidation is required for the stability of pre-ComGC."
https://openalex.org/W2061989337,"γ-Protocadherins (Pcdhγ) are type I transmembrane proteins, which are most notably expressed in the nervous system. They are enriched at synapses and involved in synapse formation, specification, and maintenance. In this study, we show that Pcdhγ C3 and Pcdhγ B4 are specifically cleaved within their ectodomains by the disintegrin and metalloprotease ADAM10. Analysis of ADAM10-deficient fibroblasts and embryos, inhibitor studies, as well as RNA interference-mediated down-regulation demonstrated that ADAM10 is not only responsible for the constitutive but also for the regulated shedding of these proteins in fibroblasts and in neuronal cells. In contrast to N-cadherin shedding, which was activated by N-methyl-d-aspartic acid receptor activation in neuronal cells, Pcdhγ shedding was induced by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid hydrate stimulation, suggesting differential regulation mechanisms of cadherin-mediated functions at synapses. Cell aggregation assays in the presence or absence of metalloprotease inhibitors strongly suggest that the ectodomain shedding events modulate the cell adhesion role of Pcdhγ. The identification of ADAM10 as the protease responsible for constitutive and regulated Pcdhγ shedding may therefore provide new insight into the regulation of Pcdhγ functions. γ-Protocadherins (Pcdhγ) are type I transmembrane proteins, which are most notably expressed in the nervous system.

Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell adhesion molecules that play a fundamental role in embryonic and tissue development (1Angst B.D. Marcozzi C. Magee A.I. J.

Their cytoplasmic domains diverge from each other and from those of the classical cadherins, indicating different binding properties and intracellular functions. With 80 members, the Pcdhs represent the largest subgroup of the cadherin superfamily in mammals (3Frank M. Kemler R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). More than 50 of these genes are arranged in three clusters: Pcdhα, Pcdhβ, and Pcdhγ. The Pcdhβ cluster comprises tandemly arrayed single-exon genes flanked by individual promoters, whereas the α- and γ-clusters additionally contain at the distal 3′ end three small exons coding for a cluster-specific constant domain. The variable domains of the Pcdhα and Pcdhγ proteins are encoded by large exons and encompass most of the transmembrane protein, including a short cytoplasmic tail. The Pcdhs derived from these gene clusters are predominantly expressed in the nervous system and localized to synaptic junctions (4Phillips G.R. Tanaka H. Frank M. Elste A. Fidler L. Benson D.L.

Functionally connected neurons are often characterized by the expression of a distinct set of cadherins, which may thus provide an adhesive code regulating neuronal differentiation and synaptogenesis (7Shapiro L.

The family-specific constant domains of Pcdhα- and Pcdhγ-proteins could transduce different extracellular informations into a common intracellular signaling pathway or other executive functions. The large number of distinct Pcdhs possibly contributes to the complexity of neuronal connections by significantly increasing the number of adhesive and/or signaling combinations (7Shapiro L. Colman D.R. Neuron. 1999; 23: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10Serafini T. Cell. 1999; 98: 133-136Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recent reports showed that Pcdhγ proteins undergo proteolytic processing events. A first cleavage is executed by a metalloprotease activity in between the 18 amino acids NH2-terminal to the transmembrane segment, releasing a soluble fragment. The precise nature of the Pcdhγ shedding protease is unknown. The proteolytic ectodomain cleavage also leads to a membrane-bound carboxyl-terminal (COOH-terminal) fragment, which is a substrate for regulated intramembrane proteolysis (11Hambsch B. Grinevich V.

Chem. 2004; 280: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this process the COOH-terminal membrane-bound fragment becomes a substrate for a presenilin/γ-secretase-mediated proteolysis, resulting in the release of a cytoplasmic COOH-terminal fragment with nuclear localization establishing a role for Pcdhγ as cell surface signaling molecules. The regulation of regulated intramembrane proteolysis as shown for substrates like Notch, APP, and CD44 is thought to occur at the level of the first ectodomain shedding processing step (13de Strooper B.

The ADAMs are a family of type I transmembrane proteins and combine features of both cell adhesion molecules and proteases. They play important roles in fertilization, neurogenesis, and angiogenesis (18Blobel C.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and are involved in the shedding of various membrane-bound proteins including cytokines, growth factors, and adhesion molecules (19Schlondorff J.

In the present study we focused on the potential role of different ADAMs in Pcdhγ shedding. We demonstrate that ADAM10 is the prominent protease responsible for Pcdhγ C3 ectodomain cleavage in fibroblasts, neuronal cells, and mouse embryos. This shedding process modulates Pcdhγ C3-mediated cell adhesion and is likely to contribute to the suggested intracellular signaling functions of Pcdhγ. Primary Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-Pcdhγ C3 antibodies against an extracellular epitope (γC3a, amino acids 71–86) and an intracellular epitope of Pcdhγ C3 (γC3β, amino acids 792–809) of Pcdhγ C3 were described elsewhere (12Haas I.G. Frank M. Veron N. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The antibody against the GFP was purchased from Research Diagnostics, Inc. (Concord, MA). ADAM10 was detected using a polyclonal antiserum B42.1 described previously (21Hartmann D. de Strooper B.

MCD (methyl-β-cyclodextrin) was obtained from Research Biochemicals International, TAPI-1, GM6001, and γ-secretase inhibitor L-685,458 from Calbiochem (Bad Soden, Germany).

Cell Culture and Transfection—Simian virus large T-antigen-immortalized and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) cell lines from ADAM9−/−, ADAM10−/−, ADAM15−/−, ADAM17−/− mice, BACE1−/−, and respective wild-type animals were generated and characterized as described elsewhere (21Hartmann D. de Strooper B.

All cells were grown in DMEM (high glucose) (PAA Laboratories) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin). The cloning of ADAM10 in pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was reported previously (26Maretzky T. Schulte M. Ludwig A. Rose-John S. Blobel C. Hartmann D. Altevogt P. Saftig P. Reiss K.

Wilfang (Erlangen, Germany), and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transfected in 6-well tissue culture plates with FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's instructions. Primary cultures of hippocampal neurons were prepared in principle as described elsewhere (27Bekkers J.M. Stevens C.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Briefly, the isolated hippocampi were dissociated enzymatically by limited trypsin digestion and mechanically with Pasteur pipettes and plated at a density of 2000–3000 cells/cm2 in 6-well tissue culture plates coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma). Pcdh Cleavage Assays—For analysis of constitutive Pcdh shedding, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in DMEM with GM6001 (10 μm), TAPI (50 μm), GI254023X (1, 3, 10 μm), GW280264X (1, 3 10 μm), or dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO, Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) for 16 h. For stimulation, fetal calf serum-free medium containing metalloprotease inhibitors or Me2SO was added. The cells were stimulated with PMA (200 ng/ml) for 4 h, with staurosporin (1 μm) for 6 h, with MCD (10 mm) for 60 min, or iononmycin (5 μm) for different time periods. The conditioned media and cells were harvested, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete; Roche Applied Science) was added. Supernatants were concentrated (30-fold) through centrifugation in Microcon centrifugal filter devices (YM-10, Millipore, Bedford, MA). Cells were washed with 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. siRNA Transfection—The mammalian expression vector pSUPER, kindly provided by Dr. Brummelkamp, was used for expression of siRNA in neuronal H4 cells. The sequence of the human ADAM10 siRNA was as follows: 5′-GACAUUUCAACCUACGAAU-3′. The sequence was separated by a 9-nucleotide non-complementary spacer (tctcttgaa) from the corresponding reverse complement of the same 19-nucleotide sequence. These sequences were inserted into the pSUPER backbone after digestion with BglII and HindIII. H4 cells were transfected with pSuper-ADAM10-siRNA vector with the use of FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to manufacturer's recommendations. SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Triton lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 5 mm Tris, 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm saccharose, pH 7.4). Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA protein assay (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were loaded on 10% SDS gels for analysis of Pcdhγ C3 stubs. The samples were electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond-P; GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany), which were blocked overnight with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS). After incubation with the indicated antibody in blocking buffer, membranes were washed three times in TBS containing 0.1% Tween (TBS-T). Primary antibodies were detected using affinity-purified peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Detection was carried out using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Signals were recorded by a luminescent image analyzer (Image Reader LAS1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed with the image analyzer software (GelProAnalyser, Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD). For reprobing blots, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated in stripping buffer (100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7) for 1 h at 60°C with occasional shaking. After three washes in large volumes of TBS-T, membranes were blocked in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and immunodetection was repeated. Cell Aggregation Assays—For cell aggregation assays either wild-type K562 cells or K562 cells stably expressing Pcdhγ C3 were used as described previously (5Frank M. Ebert M. Shan W. Phillips G.R. Arndt K. Colman D.R. Kemler R. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Briefly, single cell suspensions were produced by two passages through yellow pipette tips (10 μl, Sarstedt). Viability of cells was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion and shown to be >95% in every assay. One million cells of each transfectant clone or wild-type cells were incubated in 3 ml of DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. For analysis under constitutive conditions, cells were incubated in DMEM with GM6001 (10 μm) or Me2SO (Roth). For stimulation, metalloprotease inhibitor GM6001 or Me2SO were added. After 16 h, the cells were incubated with PMA (200 ng/ml) for a further 4 h. Afterward, cells were photographed using an inverted phase-contrast microscope (Carl Zeiss) and counted manually for both single cells and number of cells in aggregates. Average standard deviations of one representative experiment were calculated. Statistical Analysis—Values are expressed as S.D. values or means ± S.E. The standard error values indicate the variation between mean values obtained from at least three independent experiments. The assumptions for normality (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and equal variance (Levene median test) were verified with the SigmaStat 3.1 software (SYSSTAT, Erkrath, Germany). The analysis of variance were performed with one- or two-way analysis of variance. Multiple parametric statistical comparisons between experimental groups versus a control group were accomplished with Dunnett′s method. All pairwise multiple comparison procedures were performed with Tukey's test. p values <0.05 were classified as statistically significant. Inhibitor Studies Suggest an Involvement of ADAM10 in γ-Protocadherin C3 Shedding—The full-length 120-kDa Pcdhγ C3 is cleaved in the extracellular domain by a protease activity, generating a 25-kDa COOH-terminal fragment termed CTF1, which can be further processed by a γ-secretase-like activity into a CTF2 of ∼20 kDa (Ref. 12Haas I.G. Frank M. Veron N. Kemler R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar and Fig. 1A). Pcdhγ C3 is endogenously expressed in MEFs. Under steady state conditions, the majority of Pcdhγ C3 was proteolytically cleaved in MEFs as indicated by the ratio between Pcdhγ C3-CTF1 and total Pcdhγ C3 (Fig. 1B, left panel, and Fig. 1C). To identify the protease responsible for the first rate-limiting processing step in the regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Pcdhγ C3 we compared metalloprotease inhibitors with different inhibitory profiles for their ability to inhibit Pcdhγ C3 processing in MEFs. Inhibitors such as GM6001 and TAPI, both known to inhibit a wide spectrum of metalloproteases, led to a significant reduction of the 25-kDa CTF (Fig. 1, B and C, left panel). Previously, we have described two hydroxamate-based compounds that differ in their capacity to block the activities of the two disintegrin-like metalloproteases, ADAM17 and ADAM10 (28Ludwig A. Hundhausen C. Lambert M.H. Broadway N. Andrews R.C. Bickett D.M. Leesnitzer M.A. Becherer J.D. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2005; 8: 161-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The inhibitor GW280264X has been shown to preferentially block ADAM17 and to a lesser extent ADAM10, while the compound GI254023X preferentially blocked ADAM10. Western blot analysis of cell lysates of inhibitor-treated wild-type MEFs demonstrated that the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X caused a reduction in Pcdhγ C3-CTF1 levels in a dose-dependent manner, which was not observed with GW280264X (Fig. 1B, middle and right panels). The effect of GI254023X was comparable with that of the broad-spectrum metalloprotease inhibitor TAPI, indicating that the majority of metalloprotease-mediated Pcdhγ C3 proteolysis in MEFs can be attributed to ADAM10. The densitometric analysis of three independent experiments suggested that ADAM10 may be responsible for the cleavage of Pcdhγ C3 (Fig. 1C). Loss of Function and Reconstitution Experiments Provide Evidence for the Specific Role of ADAM10 in Constitutive γ-Protocadherin Shedding—To more precisely define whether ADAM10 is involved in Pcdhγ C3 shedding, we used a panel of established MEFs that were generated from mouse embryos with a targeted deletion of different ADAM proteases as described previously (21Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lubke T. Lena I.A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Weskamp G. Cai H.

As judged by the presence of both the 25 kDa CTF1 (Fig. 2A, middle panel) and a soluble Pcdhγ C3 NH2-terminal fragment, NTF, released into the medium of the cultured cells (Fig. 2A, lower panel), shedding of Pcdhγ C3 appeared to be unaffected in wild-type, ADAM9−/−, ADAM15−/−, ADAM17−/−, and BACE1−/− MEFs. In contrast, shedding of Pcdhγ C3 was almost completely abolished in ADAM10-deficient cells as confirmed by densitometric analysis of six independent experiments (Fig. 2A, right panel). To exclude heterogeneity in cell culture (21Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lubke T. Lena I.A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the essential role of ADAM10 for constitutive Pcdhγ C3 shedding also in different independently derived ADAM10-deficient cell-lines (Fig. 2B). We found that the Pcdhγ C3-CTF generation was strongly diminished, although not completely absent in one of three tested ADAM10-deficient cell lines. These results support our inhibitor data and indicate that ADAM10 is the major protease responsible for the constitutive shedding of Pcdhγ C3. Accordingly, transient transfection of wild-type mouse ADAM10 rescued the Pcdhγ C3 ectodomain proteolysis in ADAM10-deficient fibroblasts (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the disappearance of the shedding-dependent 25-kDa Pcdhγ C3 fragment as well as the significantly reduced capacity to generate soluble Pcdhγ C3 (Fig. 2, A–C) in ADAM-deficient cells strongly argues for a crucial role of ADAM10 as the major Pcdhγ C3 sheddase. To further analyze whether ADAM10 mediates shedding of Pcdhγ family members in general, we used wild-type fibroblasts and ADAM10-deficient cells expressing different Pcdhγ proteins fused COOH-terminally to GFP. Whereas cleavage of the Pcdhγ C3-GFP protein was observed in wild-type fibroblasts, a clear reduction in the generation of the Pcdhγ C3-GFP-CTF1 was noted in ADAM10-deficient cells (Fig. 2D) confirming our findings on the endogenous Pcdhγ. Analysis of Pcdhγ B4-GFP, another Pcdhγ family member, showed the same pattern: a strikingly reduced generation of COOH-terminal fragments in ADAM10-deficient cells compared with wild-type fibroblasts (Fig. 2E). This provides evidence for a general role of ADAM10 in mediating the extracellular cleavage of the different members of the Pcdhγ family. ADAM10 Is Also Crucial for Induced Shedding of γ-Protocadherin—In general, shedding of surface membrane proteins can occur in a constitutive and in a regulated fashion (16Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 26Maretzky T. Schulte M. Ludwig A. Rose-John S. Blobel C. Hartmann D.

Shinohara M. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore we set out to analyze in more detail the regulated shedding of Pcdhγ C3 (Fig. 3A). Stimulation of protein kinase C using the phorbol ester PMA (31Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 321: 265-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar) strongly induced Pcdhγ C3 shedding in wild-type fibroblasts. Staurosporine, which induces apoptosis and has been previously implicated in the activation of metalloprotease-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin (17Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) and N-cadherin (16Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), also stimulated Pcdhγ C3 shedding. Also ionomycin, an agent that promotes shedding of cadherins through stimulation of calcium influx (16Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), increased CTF1 production in wild-type cells. Depletion of cholesterol using cyclodextrin (MCD) stimulated the shedding of Pcdhγ C3 only slightly (Fig. 3A, left panel). This clearly shows that Pcdhγ C3 cleavage is controlled by several signaling pathways, which include protein kinase C- and calcium-dependent regulation. We next addressed whether this inducible cleavage is dependent on ADAM10 by analyzing the effects of these different compounds in ADAM10-deficient cells (Fig. 3A, middle panel). If another protease (e.g. TACE) was responsible for the induction of Pcdhγ shedding, we expected to observe CTF1 generation in these cells, which was not the case as shown by analysis of three independent experiments (Fig. 3A). We therefore conclude that ADAM10 is also responsible for the stimulated shedding of Pcdh γC3. It has been demonstrated that calcium influx is temporally coincident with synapse formation and leads to a redistribution of synaptic proteins during synapse maturation (32Basarsky T.A. Parpura V. Haydon P.G. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 6402-6411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Cohen-Cory S. Science. 2002; 298: 770-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Extracellular influx of calcium also induces rapid cleavage of classical cadherins (e.g. E-cadherin and N-cadherin) (16Reiss K. Maretzky T. Ludwig A. Tousseyn T. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 742-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 17Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Therefore we investigated this aspect in more detail. In wild-type cells, ionomycin induced an accumulation of the CTF1 within minutes (Fig. 3B, left panel). This effect was completely blocked with the ADAM10 inhibitor GI254023X in wild-type cells (Fig. 3B, middle panel) and also absent in ADAM10-deficient cells (Fig. 3B, right panel). Taken together, these results demonstrate that ADAM10 is the major protease responsible for the constitutive and for the inducible Pcdhγ C3 shedding. ADAM10-dependent γ-Protocadherin Cleavage in Neuronal Cells—Pcdhγ C3 as well as ADAM10 are predominantely expressed in neuronal cells. Pcdhγ C3 possibly participates in neuronal differentiation and regulation of synaptogenesis (34Junghans D. Haas I.G. Kemler R. Curr. Opin.

In previous studies, we identified the histone H2A ubiquitin ligase as Ring2, together in a complex with Ring1, Bmi1, and HPH2 (human polyhomeotic 2). We report here that the oncogene Bmi1 stimulates H2A ubiquitylation both in vitro and in vivo and that Bmi1-regulated H2A ubiquitylation is required for Hox gene silencing and normal cell growth. Our studies indicate that Bmi1 maintains the integrity of the complex through simultaneous interactions with the other subunits. We reconstituted the functional human H2A ubiquitin ligase complex and a panel of subcomplexes of different subunits. Comparisons of the H2A ubiquitin ligase activities of these different complexes revealed that Bmi1 stimulates the H2A ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring2 (and Ring1). Additionally, we demonstrated that the HoxC5 gene is regulated by ubiquitylated H2A in HeLa cells and that ubiquitylated H2A is localized on 5′ regulatory regions of the HoxC5 gene. The role of Bmi1 in H2A ubiquitylation and HoxC5 gene expression in vivo was analyzed by RNA interference experiments. Knockdown of Bmi1 causes a global and loci-specific loss of H2A ubiquitylation, up-regulation of the HoxC5 gene, and slower cell growth. Intriguingly, Ring2 binds to its target regions in Bmi1 knockdown cells. Therefore, our studies reveal that Bmi1 is required for H2A ubiquitylation and suggest that H2A ubiquitylation regulates Bmi1-mediated gene expression.

Covalent modifications of histones are emerging as key mechanisms to regulate the structure and function of chromatin (1Peterson C.L. Laniel M.-A. Curr. Biol. 2004; 14: R546-R551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Of these modifications, histone ubiquitylation has recently been shown to regulate transcription and other chromatin-based processes (2Osley M.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 74-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 3Fleming A. Osley M.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 449-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Studies of H2B ubiquitylation in budding yeasts revealed a critical role of this modification in transcription activation, elongation, and gene silencing. During gene activation, a dynamic change of ubiquitylated H2B at the promoter region is required for optimal gene expression (4Kao C.-F. Hillyer C. Tsukuda T. Henry K. Berger S. Osley M.A. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 184-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Disturbance of ubiquitylated H2B by deletion of the H2B ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Rad6 (4Kao C.-F. Hillyer C.

Moreover, through interaction with the Paf1-elongating complex (6Ng H.H. Dole S. Struhl K. J. Biol.

Rad6 distributes across the coding region rapidly after gene activation, coinciding precisely with the appearance of RNA polymerase II (8Xiao T. Kao C.-F. Krogan N.J. Sun Z.-W. Greenblatt J.F. Osley M.A. Strahl B.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 637-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). In addition, H2B ubiquitylation is also required for proper gene silencing. Deubiquitylation of H2B by Ubp10 maintains low levels of ubiquitylated H2B at telomere and rDNA regions, facilitates the binding of silencing protein Sir2, and leads to gene repression (9Gardner R.G.

The most intriguing finding concerning H2B ubiquitylation is that ubiquitylated H2B is a prerequisite for subsequent histone H3 Lys4 and Lys79 methylation, a phenomenon termed “trans-histone” regulation (11Briggs S.D.

Although the underlying mechanism remains unclear, this observation does provide a molecular explanation for the function of H2B ubiquitylation in transcription and gene silencing.H2A was the first protein shown to be ubiquitylated (15Goldknopf I.L. Taylor C.W. Baum R.M. Yeoman L.C. Olson M.O. Prestayko A.W. Busch H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 7182-7187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and ubiquitylation occurs on 5–15% of total cellular H2A in mammalian cells (16Jason L. Moore S. Lewis J. Lindsey G. Ausio J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Although earlier studies implicated the involvement of H2A ubiquitylation in gene activation (16Jason L. Moore S. Lewis J. Lindsey G. Ausio J. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), recent studies established a role of H2A ubiquitylation in gene repression (3Fleming A. Osley M.A. Cell. 2004; 119: 449-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Identification of the H2A ubiquitin ligase shed light on the functional significance of this modification in chromatin regulation. Employing a biochemical approach, we purified the histone H2A ubiquitin ligase directly from HeLa cells. Further characterization of the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex revealed that H2A ubiquitylation plays a critical role in the polycomb group (PcG) 3The abbreviations used are: PcG, polycomb group; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChDIP, chromatin double immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; uH2A, ubiquitylated H2A; Ft, flow-though.3The abbreviations used are: PcG, polycomb group; RT, reverse transcription; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; ChDIP, chromatin double immunoprecipitation; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HA, hemagglutinin; RNAi, RNA interference; siRNA, small interfering RNA; uH2A, ubiquitylated H2A; Ft, flow-though. protein-mediated gene silencing (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Using a different approach, de Napoles et al. (18de Napoles M. Mermoud J.E. Wakao R. Tang Y.A. Endoh M. Appanah R. Nesterova T.B. Silva J. Otte A.P. Vidal M. Koseki H. Brockdorff N. Dev. Cell. 2004; 7: 663-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar) found that ubiquitylated H2A (uH2A) and a subgroup of PcG proteins localized on the inactive X chromosome and that uH2A was abolished from the inactive X chromosome in a mouse line with Ring1A and Ring1B knockouts. These studies revealed a connection between H2A ubiquitylation and PcG protein-mediated gene silencing.PcG proteins are a group of evolutionarily conserved proteins that play a key role in the maintenance of the repression state of homeobox (Hox) genes and other genes through multiple rounds of cell division during development (19Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Levine S.S. King I.F.G. Kingston R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Moreover, PcG genes also regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, stem cell renewal, and certain types of cancer development (21Jacobs J.J.L. van Lohuizen M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 151-161PubMed Google Scholar, 22Valk-Lingbeek M.E. Bruggeman S.W.M. van Lohuizen M. Cell. 2004; 118: 409-418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Biochemical and genetic evidence indicates that PcG proteins exist in at least two distinct complexes, the PRC1 (polycomb-repressive complex 1) and PRC2 (polycomb-repressive complex 2) (19Simon J.A. Tamkun J.W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 210-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 20Levine S.S. King I.F.G. Kingston R.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 478-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Although PRC2 was found to possess histone methyltransferase activity (23Cao R. Zhang Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 155-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar), no enzymatic activity has been attributed to PRC1. The finding that H2A ubiquitylation is required for PcG protein-regulated gene expression suggests that H2A ubiquitylation may be part of the mechanism underlying PcG protein-regulated gene silencing.To gain insight into the relationship between H2A ubiquitylation and PcG protein-regulated cell function, we reconstituted the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex and analyzed the role of individual subunits in H2A ubiquitylation as well as in gene expression and cell proliferation. Our results indicate that the oncogene Bmi1 stimulates the H2A ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring2 both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, knockdown of Bmi1 causes a decrease of H2A ubiquitylation, abnormal gene expression, and slow cell growth. Therefore, this study establishes a critical role for Bmi1 in H2A ubiquitylation and demonstrates the importance of H2A ubiquitylation in Bmi1-regulated cell function.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Recombinant Baculoviruses and Coimmunoprecipitation Assay—cDNAs encoding Ring1 (NM_002931), Ring2 (NM_007212), Bmi1 (NM_005180), and HPH2 (human polyhomeotic 2) (NM_004427) were cloned into pFASTBAC vector (Gibco) with or without a FLAG tag at its N terminus. Recombinant baculovirus expressing individual subunits of the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex was generated and amplified following the manufacturer's protocol.Recombinant baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged subunits and non-FLAG-tagged subunits were pairwise infected into Sf9 cells in 10-cm plates (as indicated in Fig. 1). After 2 days of infection, cells were lysed (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, and 10% glycerol) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). The immunoprecipitated material was eluted with FLAG peptide and analyzed by Western blot with antibodies against FLAG (Sigma), Ring1 (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), Ring2 (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar), and Bmi1 (Upstate Technology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY).For immunoprecipitation under denaturing conditions, purified complexes were precipitated by 10–12.5% trichloroacetic acid (final concentration) and dissolved in buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.5% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, protease inhibitors). Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) was carried as described above. Immunoprecipitation with anti-Ring1 antibody was carried out as described previously (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar).Purification of the Native and Reconstituted H2A Ubiquitin Ligase Complexes—The native H2A ubiquitin ligase complex was purified from HeLa cell nuclear pellets as described (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). To reconstitute and purify the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex and different subcomplexes, baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged Bmi1 and different combinations of other subunits (Fig. 2B) or FLAG-tagged HPH2 and other subunits (Fig. 2D) were used to coinfect Sf9 cells. After 2.5 days of infection, cells were collected and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed in F lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 500 mm NaCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol, protease inhibitors) by homogenization with pestle B for three times (10 strokes each) in a period of 30 min. After being cleaned up by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted to 300 mm NaCl by mixing with F dilution buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol). The diluted supernatant was then incubated with M2 α-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. Then beads were washed with F washing buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.9), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 15% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40), and bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide (0.4 mg/ml) in washing buffer. The eluted material was concentrated and subjected to a Superdex 200 column. Fractions of the Superdex 200 were analyzed by silver staining, Western blot, and histone ubiquitin ligase assay. Histone ubiquitin ligase assay and Western blot assay were carried out as previously described (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y.

Reverse transcription was then carried out using oligo(dT)18 as primer. The resulting cDNAs were used as templates for PCR amplification. GAPDH was used as a control. The primer sequences used for PCR amplification were as follows: HoxA9, 5′-ACGTGGACTCGTTCCTGCTG and 3′-AGGTTTAATGCCATAAGGCCG; HoxC5, 5′-TGTGGGAACTATGGATCGGC and 3′-ACGGGTAAATCTGTGGCGG; HoxB1, 5′-TCAGGCGGTTGACAGCTATG and 3′-ATGCTGCGGAGGATATGGC; HoxD10, 5′-GATTCCTTGATCAGTGCCTGC and 3′-GCCGAAATGAGTTTGTTGCG; GAPDH, 5′-TCTGGAAAGCTGTGGCGTG and 3′-TCCTTGGAGGC CATGTAGGC.For ChIP and ChDIP assays, cells (control, Ring2 knockdown, Bmi1 knockdown, and FLAG-H2A and HA-ubiquitin double-tagged cell) from 15-cm plates at 70–80% confluence were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 0.125 m. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping. Cells were lysed in 300 μl of buffer B (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) by incubation on ice for 10 min. The released nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min and lysed in buffer C (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA plus protease inhibitors) by incubation at 4 °C for 20 min. The lysed nuclei were then sonicated to generate chromatin fragments with an average length of 0.4–0.7 kb. After centrifugation at 13,200 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was diluted with an equal volume of buffer D (1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl plus protease inhibitors). The diluted chromatin solution was precleared with 60 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose beads pretreated with sheared salmon sperm DNA. Antibodies were then added to the cleared chromatin, and the mixture was incubated at 4 °C overnight. Protein A/G beads were then added to the antibody-chromatin mixture and subjected to incubation for an additional 1 h with rotating. Agarose beads were then collected by centrifugation. For ChIP assay, beads was sequentially washed with TSE1 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1), TSE2 (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1), and TSE3 (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.1), each for 5–10 min. For ChDIP, beads were washed with buffer containing an equal volume of Buffer C and D twice. The bound material was eluted with 0.4 mg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluted material was then subjected to second round immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. Beads from anti-HA immunoprecipitation were washed with TSE1, TSE2, and TSE3 as described. After further washing the beads with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) twice, bound chromatin was eluted with 100 μl of buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3. After reversing the cross-linking by incubation at 65 °C overnight, immunoprecipitated DNA was extracted by phenyl/chloroform, precipitated by ethanol, and analyzed by PCR using primer pairs as follows: A, 5′-GGCAGGGATTGAGCGATTC and 3′-GGGTATCTGCAGCCATTCGG; B, 5′-CCCAAAGGGCACATAACGG and 3′-TCAGGCCCTAAGGCTCCACTA; C, 5′-TGGGCATAGGCCACCTTACC and 3′-CTCGAGCGGCCACTCATAA; D, 5′-GCACATGAGCCACGGTAAACT and 3′-AATAAGCACCCTCGAGATCCG; E, 5′-CCATGAGCTCCTACGTAGCC and 3′-TCAGAGGAGCCGCTTCGTCT.RNAi and Stable Cell Line Establishment—siRNA oligonucleotides were purchased from Invitrogen in a purified and annealed duplex form. Cells with 30–40% confluence in a 15-cm dish were used for transfection. First, we diluted 80 μl of siRNA (20 μm) in 3.2 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen). At the same time, we mixed 32 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) with 3.2 ml of Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Invitrogen) and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Then we mixed the diluted siRNA and Lipofectamine 2000 and incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, we added the mixture to cells and mixed well. Cells were cultured for 36 h and processed for the ChIP assay. An aliquot of cells were used for a Western blot assay to confirm the RNAi efficiency.The sequences targeting Ring2 are as follows: RNAi1, 5′-UUCUUCUAAAGCUAACCUCACAGCC; RNAi2, 5′-UUUAAUACAGUGAACUGGCCACUGG. The sequences targeting Bmi1 are as follows: RNAi1, 5′-AAUGUGAGGAAACUGUGGAUGAGGA; RNAi2, 5′-AACCAGAAGAAGUUGCUGAUGACCC.For stable knockdown of Ring2 and Bmi1, vectors expressing the following hairpin RNAs were transfected into HeLa cells with Effectene (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected in the presence of 4 μg/ml puromycin. Stable clones were amplified, and the knockdown efficiency, uH2A levels, and growth curve were analyzed as described (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). The two siRNAs that target Ring2 are as follows: 5′-AGAACACCATGACTACAAATTCAAGAGATTTGTAGTCATGGTGTTCT-3′ and 5′-GGCTAGAGCTTGATAATAATTCAAGAGATTATTATCAAGCTCTAGCC-3′.The two siRNAs that target Bmi1 are as follows: 5′-TGATGCCACAACCATAATATTCAAGAGATATTATGGTTGTGGCATCA-3′ and 5′-ACCAGCAAGTATTGTCCTATTCAAGAGATAGGACAATACTTGCTGGT-3′.For establishment of the FLAG-H2A and HA-ubiquitin cell line, vectors expressing FLAG-H2A (G418-resistant) and HA-ubiquitin (hygromycin-resistant) were first linearized with MfeI and then cotransfected into HeLa cells with Effectene (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. G418 at 0.5 mg/ml and hygromycin at 0.3 mg/ml were added to the medium until clones formed. Individual clones were amplified and analyzed by Western blot with anti-FLAG and HA antibodies.RESULTSDetermination of the Architecture of the Human H2A Ubiquitin Ligase Complex—Previous studies identified Ring2 as the catalytic subunit of the human histone H2A ubiquitin ligase complex (17Wang H. Wang L. Erdjument-Bromage H. Vidal M. Tempst P. Jones R.S. Zhang Y. Nature. 2004; 431: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar). Although Ring2 alone could ubiquitylate histone H2A, the activity was severely compromised when compared with an equal amount of Ring2 in the native complex (about 200-fold less active; data not shown). This indicates that other subunit(s) may regulate the H2A ubiquitin ligase activity of Ring2.To identify such subunit(s), we set out to reconstitute the human H2A ubiquitin ligase complex with baculovirus expression system. As a prerequisite for reconstitution, we first determined the pairwise interaction between individual subunits of the complex by coimmunoprecipitation assays. When HPH2 (F-HPH2) was expressed together with Bmi1 in Sf9 cells, Bmi1 could be efficiently coimmunoprecipitated by HPH2 (Fig. 1, lanes 1–3). However, under the same conditions, HPH2 failed to coimmunoprecipitate Ring1 (Fig. 1, lanes 4–6) and Ring2 (Fig. 1, lanes 7–9). These data indicate that HPH2 interacts with Bmi1 but not with Ring1 and Ring2 in the complex. Moreover, Bmi1 can be coimmunoprecipitated with both Ring1 (Fig. 1, lanes 10–12) and Ring2 (Fig. 1, lanes 13–15), suggesting that there are direct interactions between Bmi1 and Ring1 and between Bmi1 and Ring2. Since Ring2 was not coimmunoprecipitated with Ring1, we conclude that Ring1 does not interact with Ring2 directly (Fig. 1, lanes 16–18). In summary, we suggest the architecture of the complex as follows. Bmi1 is located in the center of the complex and interacts with Ring1, Ring2, and HPH2, whereas there is no strong interaction between HPH2, Ring1, and Ring2 (Fig. 1B).Reconstitution and Purification of the Human H2A Ubiquitin Ligase Complex—After establishing the role of Bmi1 in the integrity of the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex, we produced and purified the complex by coinfection of Sf9 cells with baculoviruses encoding FLAG-tagged Bmi1, Ring1, Ring2, and HPH2. As indicated in Fig. 2A, the reconstituted complex was first affinity-purified by M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads and then further purified by gel filtration through a Superdex S200 column. The latter step helped remove excess F-Bmi1 that was not incorporated into the complex (Fig. 2B, top). Silvering staining of the fractions derived from the Superdex 200 column revealed that the complex was successfully reconstituted (Fig. 2B, top, individual subunits are marked by asterisks). The reconstituted complex eluted at 443–220 kDa, and this molecular mass is consistent with the size of the native H2A ubiquitin ligase complex. Western blot analysis confirmed the identity of the subunits as Ring1, Ring2, and Bmi1 (anti-FLAG) (three middle panels). Since an antibody against HPH2 is not available, we attempted to confirm the presence of HPH2 in the reconstituted complex using an alternative approach.The protein band that migrated at a size corresponding to FLAG-Bmi1 was more intensively stained than Ring1 and Rings even after the excess FLAG-Bmi1 was removed by gel filtration (Fig. 2B, top). We speculated that it may contain both HPH2 and FLAG-Bmi1. To explore this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation assays under denaturing conditions (24Shiio Y. Eisenman R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13225-13230Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2C). After disrupting the interaction between the different subunits by detergent, the denatured complex was subjected to immunoprecipitation with M2 anti-FLAG-agarose beads. Silver staining (left, bottom panel) and Western blot analysis (left, three top panels) revealed that although FLAG-Bmi1 was completely depleted from the flow-though (Ft), another protein band was present in the Ft, in apparently stoichiometric amounts with Ring1 and Ring2 (although silver staining cannot be used to judge the amount of proteins). This protein is most likely HPH2, because it was not present in a parallel assay with complex missing HPH2 (Fig. 2C, right panels).To further confirm the presence of HPH2 in the reconstituted complex, we attempted to purify the H2A ubiquitin ligase complex by coinfection of Sf9 cells with baculoviruses expressing FLAG-HPH2, Ring1, Ring2, and Bmi1 (Fig. 2D). Western blot analysis of the anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates revealed that HPH2 could coimmunoprecipitate Ring1, Ring2, and Bmi1 (Fig. 2D, lane 3). This result indicates that HPH2 is indeed a component of the reconstituted complex. However, the reconstituted complex in FLAG-HPH2 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2D, lane 3) was low (as revealed by Western blot analysis with anti-Ring1, Ring2, and Bmi1 antibodies), and after further purification through a Superdex 200 column, only FLAG-HPH2 was revealed by silver staining (data not shown). Taken together, we concluded that we have reconstituted the human H2A ubiquitin ligase complex containing Ring1, Ring2, Bmi1, and HPH2.It is possible that the reconstituted complex contains two subcomplexes: one contains Bmi1 and Ring1, and the other one contains Bmi1 and Ring2 (Fig. 2B). To test this possibility, we performed immunoprecipitation experiments with antibody against Ring1 (which has been previously linked to protein A-agarose beads) in the purified reconstituted complex (fraction 47) (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2E, silver staining and Western blot analysis indicate that both Ring2 and Bmi1 are coimmunoprecipitated by anti-Ring1 immunoprecipitation. These results indicate that there is only a single Bmi1-containing complex that contains all of the four proteins.The reconstituted complex robustly ubiquitylated histone H2A in a histone ubiquitin ligase assay with HeLa nucleosomes as substrates (Fig. 2B, bottom panel). To further determine whether the reconstituted complex is functionally similar to the native complex, we compared the histone ubiquitin ligase activity and substrate specificity of these two complexes. When equal amounts of Ring2 were used in the histone ubiquitin ligase assay (Fig. 3A, top), the H2A ubiquitin ligase activity of the reconstituted complex was equivalent to the nati"

Brain. 1952; 75: 408-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). The most common FAP-related point mutation in TTR is the substitution of a valine for a methionine at position 30 of the polypeptide chain (2Saraiva M.J. Costa P.P. Goodman D.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1984; 76: 2171-2177Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It was previously described that non-fibrillar TTR aggregates were present in sciatic nerves of asymptomatic individuals, which also presented increased caspase-3 activation (3Sousa M.M. Cardoso I. Fernandes R. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1993-2000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Other stress-related molecules were also found to be linked to TTR aggregate-induced degeneration, namely pro-inflammatory cytokines and the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (4Sousa M.M. Du Yan S. Fernandes R. Guimaraes A. Stern D. Saraiva M.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Cellular stress conditions including altered redox status, increased protein synthesis, expression of misfolded proteins, and perturbation of calcium homeostasis can induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-specific stress response (6Schröder M. Kaufman R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 739-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2378) Google Scholar). This adaptive response is known as unfolded protein response and includes three basic signal transduction pathways mediated by the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), and double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK). All the main transducers are activated in response to accumulation of unfolded proteins, in a process dependent on the ER-resident chaperone BiP. BiP is a member of the heat-shock protein 70 family that transiently binds to newly synthesized, misfolded, or unassembled proteins in the ER lumen (7Lee A.S. Methods (Amst.). 2005; 35: 373-381Google Scholar). The more effective chemical inducers of BiP expression are tunicamycin (which blocks N-glycosylation), thapsigargin (inhibitor of the ER Ca2+ ATPase), and calcium ionophores, all affecting the ER folding capacity. It is now widely accepted that the specific induction of BiP is indicative of ER stress due to its key role in the regulation of ER stress signaling. In non-stressed conditions, BiP binds to the luminal domains of IRE1, PERK, and ATF6, keeping them in the ER. Upon ER stress, BiP is released from IRE1 and PERK, permitting their oligomerization, phosphorylation, and activation (8Shen J. Chen X. Hendershot L. Prywes R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 1-2Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1039) Google Scholar, 9Bertolotti A. Zhang Y. Hendershot L. Harding H. Ron D. Nat.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17680-17687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and ATF6 is transported to the Golgi, where it is cleaved to generate the p50 active form, which migrates to the nucleus and initiates transcription (11Kokame K. Kato H. Miyata T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 9199-9205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). On other hand, active PERK phosphorylates the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α), resulting in attenuation of global mRNA translation (12Harding H. Zhang Y. Ron D. Nature. 1999; 397: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (2454) Google Scholar). Fluctuations in the calcium pool are involved in cellular signaling upon ER stress (13Paschen W. Mengesdorf T. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 409-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the expression of ER stress-related proteins (BiP, ATF6, and eIF2α) in tissues containing TTR deposits but not specialized in TTR synthesis and the contribution of calcium pools in this process. Subjects—Human salivary gland (SG) biopsies were used in Western blots and immunohistochemical analyses as described previously (5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For the immunohistochemical studies, four sections each of TTR-V30M associated FAP patients, asymptomatic carriers (FAP0), and control individuals were analyzed. For Western blots, a pool of SG from control and FAP0 individuals was applied. Animals—Knock-out mice for heat-shock factor 1 and mouse endogenous TTR expressing human V30MTTR, characterized previously (14Santos S.D. Saraiva M.J. Program No. 670.9, Abstract Viewer and Itinerary Planner. Society for Neuroscience, Washington, D. C.2005Google Scholar), were used. The animals were housed in a controlled temperature room that was maintained under a 12-h light/dark period. Water and food were available ad libitum. All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the European Community guidelines on the ethical use of animals and minimizing the number of animals used and their suffering. Experiments were carried out in 6-month-old mice (n = 10). Tissue Analyses—Immunohistochemistry (IHC) on mouse dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and human SG sections was performed as described previously (5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were: polyclonal goat anti-BiP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:50), polyclonal rabbit anti-TTR (Dako, 1:1000), and polyclonal rabbit anti-eIF2α[P] (phosphorylated form of eIF2α) (BIOSOURCE, 1:50). For fluorescence microscopy, antigens were visualized using donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 568 (Molecular Probes). Semiquantitative IHC analysis was performed using the Scion Image software (Scion Corp.). Results are presented as percentage of occupied area ± standard deviation (S.D.). Statistical significance was analyzed by the two-tailed Student's t test. Congo red staining was performed as described previously (15Puchtler H. Sweat F. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1965; 13: 693-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Proteins—Recombinant wild type TTR was produced as described previously (16Almeida M.R. Damas A.M. Lans M.C. Brower A. Saraiva M.J. Endocrine. 1997; 6: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Generation of oligomers was achieved after dialysis of TTR (at 250 μg × ml−1) against water, pH 7-8, and stirring for 7 days at room temperature. The preparations were positive by thioflavin-T spectrofluorometric assays. These conditions were chosen as a maximum peak is obtained in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests using an antibody for oligomeric species (17Kayed R. Head E. Thompson J.L. McIntire T.M. Milton S.C. Cotman C.W. Glabe C.G. Science. 2003; 300: 486-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Transmission electron microscopy analyses reveal oligomeric structures composed of TTR subunits as described in supplemental data. Cell Culture Assays—ND7/23 cell line (mouse neuroblastoma × rat neuron hybrid) and SHSY5Y cell line. (Human neuroblastomas were from the European Collection of Cell Cultures.) Cells were propagated in 75-cm2 flasks in monolayer and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95 and 5% CO2. ND7/23 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units × ml−1 of penicillin/streptomycin until 50-60% confluence. SHSY5Y cells were grown in medium containing Ham's F12 (Invitrogen):minimum essential medium (Invitrogen) in a proportion of 1:1 supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1% non-essential amino acids (Sigma), 15% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units × ml−1 of penicillin/streptomycin until 70-80% confluence. Subsequently, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and treated for 16-24 h with 1 μm soluble TTR or 1 μm TTR oligomers in the presence or absence of different compounds as indicated; these included 2.5 μm thapsigargin (Sigma), 20 μm dantrolene (Sigma), or 1 μm xestospongin C (Calbiochem) in growing media containing 2% fetal bovine serum. Following treatment, cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, trypsinized, and lysed in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 30 mm sodium fluoride, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1× protease inhibitors mixture (Amersham Biosciences)) by three cycles of freeze-thawing for Western blot analyses. Total protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad assay kit (Bio-Rad). For immunocytochemistry analysis, cells were grown in LAB-TEK (Nunc). After treatment, the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in blocking buffer (4% fetal bovine serum; 1% bovine serum albumin) for 30 min at 37 °C. The primary antibody, eIF2α[P] (1:500, BIOSOURCE), was incubated at 4 °C overnight. After washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, the corresponding secondary horse-radish peroxidase antibody was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was developed with 3-amino-9-ethyl carbaxole (Sigma) counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted with aqueous mounting medium. Caspase-3 Assay—ND7/23 cells were propagated and treated as described above. Activation of caspase-3 was measured using the fluorometric caspase-3 assay kit, (Sigma) following the manufacturer's instructions. The remaining cell lysate was used to measure total cellular protein concentration with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, using bovine serum albumin as standard. Western Blot—Equal amounts of protein from treated cells or SG lysates were separated in 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a nitrocellulose Hybond-C membrane (Amersham Biosciences) using a semidry system. The primary antibodies used were goat polyclonal anti-BiP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:1000), goat polyclonal anti-ATF6 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:200), polyclonal rabbit anti-eIF2α[P] (BIOSOURCE, 1:500), and mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin (Sigma, 1:5000) for normalization. The enhanced chemiluminescence method (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to develop the blots. Quantitative analysis of Western blot images was performed using the Scion software (Scion Corp.). Results are the average of three independent experiments and are presented as normalized density ± S.D. Increase in BiP Levels Occurs Only in DRG with TTR Deposition—We analyzed the expression of the ER-resident chaperone BiP in DRG of 6-month-old mice. BiP was only detected in DRG with TTR deposits (Fig. 1i, panels A and B), whereas DRG negative for TTR extracellular deposits were negative for BiP (Fig. 1i, panels D and E). The link between BiP expression and TTR deposits was further analyzed by immunofluorescence. BiP and TTR did not co-localize; in fact, ganglia in close contact with TTR deposits (Fig. 1i, panel C, arrows) exhibit BiP staining by opposition with TTR-free ganglia (Fig. 1i, panel F). Increase in BiP staining was also observed in other organs that present extensive TTR deposition, namely the stomach (results not shown). Increase in BiP Levels Occurs in Human Salivary Glands with TTR Deposition—The use of human salivary gland biopsies as a tool for diagnosis and research on FAP has been recently described (5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We investigated the expression of BiP by Western blot and IHC in normal and FAP SGs. Asymptomatic carriers of TTR V30M with extracellular TTR aggregate deposition clearly displayed increase BiP levels in comparison with normal control subjects (Fig. 1ii, panel D, Western blots). The Western blot results were further confirmed using IHC; as compared with control biopsies, increase in BiP levels was clearly detected in asymptomatic carriers and in FAP patients (Fig. 1ii, panels A-C and quantification chart). Small TTR Oligomers Induce BiP Expression Increase in a Cell Culture System, in a Process Dependent on Ca2+ Release from the ER—We used a mouse neuronal ND7 cell line to investigate the effect of small TTR oligomers on BiP expression. As shown in Fig. 2i, TTR oligomers induced an increase in the amount of BiP in a similar way as thapsigargin, a classical chemical inducer of BiP. As many of the cellular responses subsequent to ER stress are dependent on the action of the secondary messenger Ca2+, we investigated whether the ER stress response triggered by TTR oligomers was mediated by the mobilization of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol using the specific inhibitors dantrolene (inhibitor of RyR channels) and xestospongin C (inhibitor of d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphategated channels). The increase in BiP levels was suppressed when any of the inhibitors were included in concentrations exerting a protective effect, without eliciting any toxic response by themselves (results not shown). Fig. 2ii, documents by immunocytochemistry an increase in BiP staining of ND7/23 cells incubated with TTR oligomers that is far less visible in the same cells incubated with soluble TTR or with TTR oligomers plus dantrolene. Unfolded Protein Response Markers in Human Salivary Glands with TTR Deposition and in Cell Culture in the Presence of TTR Oligomers—To investigate whether the increase in the amount of BiP signals for ER stress, we analyzed the expression of two proteins involved in the unfolded protein response: ATF6 and eIF2α. In Western blots of SG from control individuals, the ATF6-p90 subunit was not detected in FAP samples in contrast to normal controls, where it was clear. The intensity of the p50 subunit did not vary between the two samples (Fig. 3i, panel D). An increase in eIF2α[P] in tissues from carriers and FAP patients versus controls was detected by Western blot (Fig. 3i, panel D) and by IHC in SG sections (Fig. 3i, panels A-C and quantification chart). We next investigated whether eIF2α was activated by TTR oligomers in cell culture (using a human neuroblastoma cell line). As shown in Fig. 3ii, TTR oligomers activated eIF2α as observed for BiP, further confirming the effect of TTR oligomers in ER stress. Small TTR Oligomers Induce Caspase-3 Activation in a Cell Culture System, in a Process Dependent on Ca2+ Release from the ER—Finally, we tested whether the ER stress response triggered by TTR oligomers with subsequent mobilization of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol leads to cell death. We measured caspase-3 activation in the presence of specific Ca2+ inhibitors, dantrolene and xestospongin C, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 4, caspase-3 activation was only observed in cells treated with TTR oligomers; treatment with the inhibitors abrogated this cellular response. This study clearly demonstrates the connection between the ER stress response and FAP. Increased levels of the ER-resident chaperone BiP were found, in a consistent way, in human biopsies of FAP patients, in TTR transgenic mouse DRG and cell line models. In mouse DRG, BiP expression is only visible in cells of the ganglia in close contact with TTR extracellular deposits, suggesting a cause-and-effect relation. These results were further confirmed in human salivary gland biopsies, by Western blot and IHC. The increase in BiP level was visible in areas where mutant TTR is deposited (5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). BiP is a protein with a central role in the cellular response to stress, being a “sensor” of ER stress (7Lee A.S. Methods (Amst.). 2005; 35: 373-381Google Scholar). In this way, it was possible to use BiP to assess the occurrence of ER stress in FAP; thus, we confirmed ER stress induction in FAP tissues by proteolysis of ATF6 and phosphorylation of eIF2α. Recent data reported that activation of NF-κB dependent on the phosphorylated form of eIF2α as a substitution of serine for alanine at position 51 of the polypeptide chain resulted in inability to induce NF-κB activation (18Jiang H. Wek S. McGrath B. Sheuner D. Kaufman R. Cavener D. Wek R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5651-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It is now well understood that the neurodegeneration pathways in FAP involve activation of NF-κB (5Sousa M.M. Barbas do Amaral J. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. FASEB J. 2005; 19: 124-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 19Soprano D.R. Herbert J. Soprano K.J. Schon E.A. Goodman D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 11793-11798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it is possible that increase in eIF2α phosphorylation can partially account for NF-κB activation in TTR-related amyloidosis. Increase in BiP levels observed in our study on FAP tissues and transgenic mice possibly occurs also in other systemic amyloidoses. Using an ND7/23 cell line, one of the few cell lines of peripheral neurons, and a human neuroblastoma cell line, we found that extracellular TTR oligomers can induce BiP expression and activation of eIF2α in a way similar to the chemical inducer thapsigargin. This increase in BiP levels involves the mobilization of the secondary messenger Ca2+ from the ER as it can be blocked by the Ca2+-channel inhibitors. The fact that xestospongin C suppressed the increase in BiP levels suggests that another secondary messenger, d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, can be involved in the process. Considering the fact that d-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate is generated in the plasma membrane by hydrolysis of phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate, one can speculate that an interaction of TTR oligomers with the membrane is an essential step in this mechanism. We have previously shown (4Sousa M.M. Du Yan S. Fernandes R. Guimaraes A. Stern D. Saraiva M.J. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7576-7586Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that incubation of cells (Schawnnoma cell line) with TTR aggregates leads to caspase-3 activation and DNA fragmentation. At the time, the pathway/s underlying this finding were unknown; for the present work, we tested in additional experiments depicted in Fig. 4 whether dantrolene and xestospongin C, inhibitors of the mobilization of Ca2+ from the ER to the cytosol, could inhibit caspase-3 activation; indeed, this was the case, re-enforcing the notion of ER stress by extracellular TTR deposition as a toxic event in this system. TTR synthesis occurs mainly in the liver and the choroid plexuses of brain (18Jiang H. Wek S. McGrath B. Sheuner D. Kaufman R. Cavener D. Wek R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5651-5663Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), tissues devoid of TTR deposition in FAP. Instead, extracellular systemic deposition affects several organs and tissues with special involvement of the peripheral nervous system. Besides peripheral nerve, deposition in DRG contributes to the polyneuropathy characteristic of the disease. Early non-fibrillar aggregates occur extracellularly in presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of FAP (3Sousa M.M. Cardoso I. Fernandes R. Guimaraes A. Saraiva M.J. Am. J.

Sobue G. Neurology. 2004; 63: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The availability of a transgenic model with extracellular TTR aggregates in DRG was a unique tool to study molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis. In this regard, the clear BiP overexpression in DRG cells surrounded by TTR aggregates suggests indeed a role for ER stress associated with extracellular deposition and will be used to further dissect molecular mechanisms associated with neurodegeneration in FAP. An increase in BiP levels was reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of inclusion body myositis, as assessed in both human biopsy samples and cultured muscle fibers (21Vattemi G. Engel W. McFerrin J. Askanas V. Am. J. Pathol. 2004; 164: 1-7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In contrast, BiP levels were not significantly different in the brains of patients with sporadic Alzheimer disease, or presenilin 1-mediated familial early onset Alzheimer disease as compared with control individuals (22Sato N. Urano F. Yoon Leem J. Kim S. Li M. Donoviel D. Bernstein A. Lee A.S. Ron D. Veselits M.L. Sisodia S.S. Thinakaran G. Nat.

Napankangas U. Lindholm D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2004; 322: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This observation might relate to differences in aggregate localization in tissues and/or cell-specific susceptibility to aggregates. Future studies need to address novel intracellular signaling mechanisms related to extracellular stimuli such as protein aggregates in systemic amyloidoses to establish targeted therapeutic strategies. In a broader perspective, the finding of induction of ER stress by an extracellular protein can have implications in the way we understand signal transduction in general.

https://openalex.org/W1973474832,"Progression of prostate cancer to androgen independence is suspected to involve the androgen and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathways. Here for the first time, the transcriptomes associated with each pathway and common transcriptional targets in response to stimulation of both pathways were identified in human prostate cancer cells using Affymetrix GeneChip technology (Human Genome U133 plus2). Statistically significant changes in the levels of 858 genes in response to androgen and 303 genes in response to activation of the PKA pathway were determined using GeneSpring software. Expression of a subset of these genes (22) that were transcriptional targets for the androgen and/or PKA pathways were validated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analyses. Application of small interfering RNAs to the androgen receptor (AR) revealed that in addition to KLK3, levels of expression of KLK2 and SESN1 were regulated by AR activated by both the androgen and PKA signaling pathways. SESN1 was identified as a gene repressed by activated AR. These results provide a broad view of the effects of the androgen and PKA signaling pathways on the transcriptional program of prostate cancer cells and indicate that only a limited number of genes are targeted by cross-talk between AR and PKA pathways."

https://openalex.org/W1983691362,"It has been previously shown that upon sustained stimulation (30-60 min) with phorbol esters, protein kinase C (PKC)α andβII become sequestered in a juxtanuclear region, the pericentrion.

In this work we characterize the pericentrion as a PKC-dependent subset of the recycling compartment. We demonstrate that upon sustained stimulation of PKC, both protein (CD59, caveolin) and possibly also lipid (Bodipy-GM1) cargo become sequestered in a PKC-dependent manner.

Members of the protein kinase C (PKC) 2The abbreviations used are: PKC, protein kinase C; cPKC, classical PKC; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DAG, diacylglycerol; PMA, 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate; HEK cells, human embryonic kidney cells; LDL, low density lipoprotein; GFP, green fluorescent protein. superfamily (1Takai Y. Kishimoto A. Inoue M. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 7603-7609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) can be grouped into three families (classical, novel, and atypical) that consist of 11 isoforms that are involved in various signal transduction pathways and cellular regulatory processes. Classical isoforms of PKC (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, γ) are activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) and calcium, which bind to their C1 and C2 domains, respectively. By contrast, novel PKC isoforms have a truncated C2 domain, and their activation is calcium-independent. Importantly, the phorbol ester 4β-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) was shown to mimic DAG action on PKC (2Niedel J.E. Kuhn L.J. Vandenbark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) and is an established activator of PKC. The atypical PKCs are calcium- and DAG-independent as they lack a C2 domain and have a truncated C1 domain (3Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 4Newton A.C. Johnson J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 5Parker P.J. Murray-Rust J. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 131-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). DAG- and calcium-activated cPKC isoforms rapidly translocate to the plasma membrane within seconds to minutes after generation of DAG or stimulation with PMA, thus accessing membrane substrates (6Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2368) Google Scholar). It was shown previously by our laboratory that upon sustained stimulation (30-60 min) with PMA, and PKCα and βII become subsequently sequestered in a subset of recycling endosomes, the pericentrion, identified by co-localization with Rab11 (7Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, sustained activation of PKC also resulted in sequestration and retention of recycling transferrin, suggesting a role for PKC in regulating endocytosis and sequestration of recycling components. Mechanistically, this sequestration was shown to be phospholipase D-dependent (8Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28251-28256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 9Hu T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 35702-35708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and was also selectively inhibited by a mechanism involving ceramide formed from the salvage pathway (10Becker K.P. Kitatani K. Idkowiak-Baldys J. Bielawski J. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 2606-2612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The uptake and intracellular transport of molecules involves their flow through different endosomal compartments (11Mukherjee S. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 759-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). The first step of internalization may either engage clathrin-coated pits (12Mousavi S.A. Malerod L. Berg T. Kjeken R. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or may occur in a clathrin-independent fashion (13Nichols B.J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 406-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Once internalized, molecules traffic in early endosomes, where often dissociation of ligand from receptor takes place. Next, they are sorted within the sorting endosomes. Molecules that are targeted for degradation enter late endosomes and then the lysosomes. Other molecules are recycled back to the cell surface through the endosomal recycling compartment. By targeting molecules to the recycling compartment, cells can, thus, adjust the availability of receptors or other membrane proteins at the plasma membrane. These considerations led us to propose that sustained activation of PKC may regulate plasma membrane function through the sequestration of recycling components. Along those lines, recent studies indicate that activation of PKC regulates the availability of the dopamine transporter on the cell surface (14Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22168-22174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Also, the norepinephrine transporter was shown to be down-regulated through its sequestration upon PKCα activation (16Jayanthi L.D. Samuvel D.J. Ramamoorthy S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19315-19326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Rotmann et al. (17Rotmann A. Strand D. Martine U. Closs E.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54185-54192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) found that treatment of cells with PMA resulted in internalization (possibly to the pericentrion) of the human cationic amino acid transporter hCAT-1. Furthermore, synaptotagmin IX was shown to be internalized to a compartment that resembles the pericentrion in a PKCα-dependent manner (18Haberman Y. Ziv I. Gorzalczany Y. Fukuda M. Sagi-Eisenberg R. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). All these data indicate that active PKCα can indeed selectively regulate sequestration of certain molecules from the cell surface. In this work we characterize the pericentrion as a PKC-dependent subset of the recycling compartment. Interestingly, the results show that both protein and possibly lipid cargo are sequestered in a PKC-dependent manner. This sequestration displays a strict and unusual temperature requirement and leads to the formation of a distinct membrane structure. These results also show that sequestration of PKC and formation of the pericentrion require plasma membrane integrity and are clathrin-dependent processes.

Cell Culture—HEK 293 cells were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were passaged every 3-4 days to maintain cells in logarithmic growth. Plasmid Construction—All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out following standard protocols. The wild type pBK-CMV-GFP-PKCα was previously described (19Feng X. Zhang J. Barak L.S. Meyer T. Caron M.G. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

The wild type and dominant negative plasmid of dynamin K44A (hemagglutinin-tagged) was a generous gift from Dr. Sammanda Ramamoorthy (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Transfection with wild type and K44A dynamin was determined using anti-hemagglutinin antibody (Abcam). The YFP-5HT2A receptor construct was a generous gift from Dr. John R. Raymond (Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC). Transient Transfection, Indirect Immunofluorescence, and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were plated onto 35-mm confocal dishes (MatTek) at a density 5 × 105 cells/dish and grown for 24 h. Transient transfection of DNA (0.5-1 μg/dish) was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Transfected cells were grown for 24 h in 10% fetal bovine serum media. A transfection efficiency of 40-60% was obtained in these experiments. Cells expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion alone were viewed after a 10-min fixation with 3.7% formaldehyde. For indirect immunofluorescence, after fixation, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100 for 10 min. Cells were washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and blocked with 2% human serum, PBS for 1 h at room temperature. All incubations with primary antibodies were performed in 2% human serum, phosphate-buffered saline overnight at 4 °C. All confocal images were taken with a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM 510 Meta; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Each microscopic image is representative of 20 fields over a minimum of three experiments, and all images were taken at the equatorial plane of the cell. Raw data images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop® 7.0 for publication. Cell Fractionation—Cellular fractionation was performed using OptiPrep density gradient medium following Axis-Shield protocol (S23) with some modifications. Briefly, cell lysate was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min to pellet nuclei and cell debris. Supernatant was loaded on the top of step (20, 15, 10, 5%) Opti-Prep gradient and centrifuged for 16 h at 90,000 × g. After centrifugation, 50 fractions were collected and analyzed for the presence of PKCα-GFP using anti GFP antibody (Santa Cruz), and Rab11 was detected using anti-Rab11 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Inhibition of Endocytosis—Cells were treated with 10 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin for 60 min. For specific inhibition of clathrin-independent endocytosis, cells were pretreated with 25 μg/ml nystatin or 12 μg/ml filipin for 30 min. For inhibition of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, cells were potassium-depleted as described previously (20Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) or pretreated with hypertonic (400 mm) sucrose for 30 min. PMA Induces Sequestration of Plasma Membrane Proteins to the Pericentrion—Because sustained activation of PKCα and -βII resulted in sequestration of transferrin to a juxtanuclear location (the pericentrion) distinct from the Golgi (7Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), it became critical to determine whether the PKC effects were specific to transferrin or were more generalized to various recycling components. To this end we investigated the effects of sustained activation of PKC on several plasma membrane proteins including caveolin-1, CD59, and flotillin-1. Stimulation of HEK 293 cells with 100 nm PMA for 60 min resulted in concentration of caveolin-1 (a key constituent of caveoli) (21Glenney Jr., J.R. Soppet D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10517-10521Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) at the pericentriolar region and its colocalization with GFP-tagged PKCα (Fig. 1A). CD59 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein present in lipid rafts that plays important roles in regulation of the complement system (22Nichols B.J. Kenworthy A.K. Polishchuk R.S. Lodge R. Roberts T.H. Hirschberg K. Phair R.D. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Sustained stimulation of cells with PMA also resulted in accumulation of CD59 protein in the pericentrion and its colocalization with GFP-tagged PKCα (Fig. 1B). It is important to note that sequestration of CD59 was not blocked by the Golgi disrupting agent brefeldin A (data not shown). Thus, sustained activation of PKC regulates the relocalization/sequestration of several plasma membrane proteins. Moreover, pretreatment with Gö 6976, an inhibitor specific for members of the cPKC subfamily, prevented sequestration of CD59 and caveolin (Fig. 1, A and B), suggesting that the PMA effects are mediated by cPKCs and not by other potential targets of PMA. Importantly, adding Gö 6976 after PMA treatment caused dissociation of both CD59 and caveolin from the pericentrion (Fig. 1, A and B). Therefore, the effects of cPKC on sequestration require sustained activity of PKC. In contrast, flotillin-1, a putative marker of lipid rafts, did not seem to sequester into the pericentrion after PMA treatment (Fig. 1C). Instead, it partially colocalized with a Golgi marker (anti-giantin) (data not shown). Also, treatment of cells with PMA did not induce sequestration of overexpressed serotonin receptor in the absence of agonist (Fig. 1D). Thus, whereas several proteins respond to sustained stimulation of PKC, this is not a generalized nonspecific effect. Taken together these results demonstrate that long term stimulation of cPKC with PMA leads to selective sequestration of membrane proteins (including PKC) to the PKC-dependent endosomal recycling compartment. PMA Induces Sequestration of the Fluorescently Tagged Ganglioside Bodipy-GM1 to the Pericentrion—Because activation of PKC by phorbol esters led to sequestration of several plasma membrane proteins, it became of great interest to determine whether this translocation was accompanied by membrane lipids or was restricted to membrane proteins. Using a fluorescent analog of the GM1 ganglioside (Bodipy-GM1) (Fig. 2A), it was observed that in the absence of PMA, Bodipy-GM1 localized to the plasma membrane, and some internalization was also observed. Interestingly, upon 1 h of stimulation with PMA, internalized Bodipy-GM1 became more clustered and localized in the pericentrion. This sequestration was also highly dependent on PKC activity as Bodipy-GM1 was dispersed with Gö 6976 treatments. By contrast, localization of fluorescent sphingomyelin was not changed after PMA treatment, revealing a perinuclear localization (Fig. 2B) (distinct from the lysosomes as shown previously (23Koval M. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2169-2181Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar)). This localization was not influenced significantly by PKC activation with PMA or inhibition with Gö 6976 and, thus, seems to be PKC-independent. Interestingly when Bodipy-SM was analyzed together with fluorescent PKC, it partially colocalized with sequestered PKC, indicating its PKC-independent presence in the recycling compartment. Bodipy SM was also shown to be present in the Golgi (20Puri V. Watanabe R. Singh R.D. Dominguez M. Brown J.C. Wheatley C.L. Marks D.L. Pagano R.E. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 535-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). We observed that after treatment with brefeldin A there was only some diffusion of internalized sphingomyelin (data not shown), suggesting that it is present in both recycling endosomes and Golgi. These results show that sustained PKC activity leads to sequestration of Bodipy-GM1 and suggest selective sequestration of plasma membrane lipids. PMA Induces Selective Sequestration of Recycling Components—The above results along with the previous results showing PKC-dependent sequestration of transferrin (7Becker K.P. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52747-52754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) suggested that PKC exerted an effect on recycling components. At least two “independent” recycling systems have been identified. Transferrin is a known marker of recycling endosomes, whereas LDL is transported and degraded in the lysosomal pathway. We, therefore, employed fluorescent LDL from human plasma, Bodipy-LDL, as a marker of the degradative pathway. Sustained stimulation of HEK 293 cells did not result in accumulation of Bodipy-LDL (Fig. 3A) in the pericentrion, suggesting a lack of sequestration of lysosomally targeted endosomes by PKC. In addition to LDL as a well studied cargo for the endolysosomal system, the fluorescent lipid analog DiIC16 (3Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) has been shown by Mukherjee et al. (24Mukherjee S. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1271-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) to be targeted to the late endosomes/lysosomes. The results showed that DiIC16 (3Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) did not colocalize with GFP-tagged PKCα after PMA treatment (Fig. 3B). Additionally, no colocalization of sequestered PKC with the lysosomal protein Lamp1 was seen (Fig. 3C). Taken together these data demonstrate that sustained stimulation of cPKC leads to selective sequestration of membrane recycling components and not endolysosomal components. Detection of PKC Translocation by Cell Fractionation and Relationship to the Rab11 Compartment—Because PKC translocated to a compartment different from the plasma membrane, we wondered whether this could be detected biochemically. Therefore, translocation of PKC to the pericentrion was also analyzed using cellular fractionation (Fig. 4A) using Optip-Prep density gradient and following a protocol that was used previously to detect recycling compartment fractions (25Sheff D.R. Daro E.A. Hull M. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 123-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). In control cells, PKC was present throughout the gradient. Treatment of cells with PMA led to the formation of a distinct peak (fractions 19-23) of PKCα that was absent in cells treated with vehicle only. Interestingly this peak was formed within fractions that are enriched in Rab11 protein. These recycling endosomal fractions were separated from lysosomal fractions (Lamp1 positive), and they also separated form the endoplasmic reticulum using calnexin as a marker. Importantly, when cells were treated with Gö 6976, the PKC-enriched fractions 19-23 disappeared. Instead, PKC became enriched in plasma membrane fractions 3-5 (enriched in (Na+K+)-ATPase) as well as fractions 25-35 that probably represent dispersed vesicular structures observed under confocal microscope after Gö 6976 posttreatment (see Fig. 1). Interestingly, the location of Rab11 as detected by confocal microscopy was not affected significantly by PMA (Fig. 4B). In both vehicle- and PMA-treated cells, Rab11 displayed a juxtanuclear location consistent with previous studies (26Ullrich O. Reinsch S. Urbe S. Zerial M. Parton R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 913-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). Interestingly Gö 6976 posttreatment led to slight dispersal of this compartment, which could correspond to changes in distribution in the density gradient. To further analyze relationship between the pericentrion and the Rab11 compartment, colocalization studies were performed. As analyzed by confocal microscopy (Fig. 4C), sequestered PKC colocalized but also extended beyond the Rab11 compartment. Taken together, these data indicate that there are indeed changes in cellular localization (distribution) of PKCα-GFP after PMA treatment and that the pericentrion becomes associated with the Rab11-positive compartment. Translocation of PKCα and Formation of the Pericentrion Exhibit a Strict Temperature Requirement—While examining translocation of proteins and lipids to the pericentrion, we found that proper incubation temperature during treatments was crucial. Stimulation with PMA for 1 h at 37 °C resulted in the translocation of GFP-PKC α to the pericentrion (Fig. 5A); however, at lower temperatures (4-30 °C), this translocation was not observed (Fig. 5A). Importantly, translocation of PKC at 37 °C was fully reversed with subsequent incubation at 4 °C. Moreover, re-incubation at 37 °C restored translocation of PKC α (Fig. 5A). Notably, at all temperatures, PMA was fully capable of causing translocation of PKC to the plasma membrane, suggesting that it is the sequestration step that displays the strict temperature requirement (Fig. 5A). Temperature also exerted a similar effect on the PMA-induced and PKC-mediated sequestration of the CD59 protein, such that no sequestration was observed at 4 °C. This sequestration also displayed dynamic reversibility such that it was reversed by incubation at 4 °C after the initial sequestration at 37 °C and then restored by re-incubating at 37 °C (Fig. 5B). As expected, 30 °C did not affect endocytosis in general, since uptake of transferrin was comparable with cells incubated at 37 °C (Fig. 5C). It should be noted that some sequestration at 30 °C was observed only when cells were incubated with PMA for extended periods of time (data not shows), suggesting that the temperature effect may be a kinetic one affecting the rates of sequestration. These data emphasize the exquisite dependence of translocation of PKC and the sequestration of its targets to the pericentriolar region, which require physiologic temperature. PKC-dependent Sequestration of Recycling Components Coincides with the Formation of a Distinct Membrane Structure—The active translocation of PKC, Bodipy-GM1, and proteins to the pericentrion suggested that a distinct compartment containing endosomes and membrane structures may exist around the centrosome in a PKC-dependent manner. To visualize this compartment, we employed three-dimensional reconstruction. Reconstruction of a cell image in three-dimensions using Volocity 3 (Improvision) software showed that the pericentrion is formed by concentration of recycling endosomes in close proximity to the nucleus (Fig. 6B), and this was distinct from the lysosomal compartment (Fig. 6A). These data indicate PKC-dependent structural reorganization in the perinuclear region. PKC-dependent Sequestration of Molecules to the Pericentrion Is Clathrin-dependent—Next, we investigated which endocytotic pathway (clathrin versus caveolar) is involved in the PKC-dependent sequestration. We employed various methods to further analyze this requirement. When clathrin-dependent endocytosis was blocked by depleting cells of potassium or incubating in hypertonic sucrose, transferrin was not internalized, GFP-PKCα remained on the plasma membrane, and no pericentrion formation was observed (Fig. 7A). Also CD59, sequestration to the pericentrion was inhibited (Fig. 7B). Moreover, we observed inhibition of PKCα sequestration (observed only in about 5% of transfected cells) and pericentrion formation in cells transfected with a dominant negative mutant of dynamin K44A (Fig. 8) that is known to inhibit constriction and budding of clathrin coated pits (27Damke H. Gossen M. Freundlieb S. Bujard H. Schmid S.L. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 209-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Thus, the clathrin-dependent pathway appears to be required for the PKCα-dependent formation of the pericentrion irrespective of whether the target cargo utilize clathrin-dependent (e.g. transferrin) or clathrin-independent (e.g. CD59) pathways of initial internalization.FIGURE 8Pericentrion formation in dominant negative mutant of dynamin.

The bar represents 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To inhibit clathrin-independent endocytosis, cells were pretreated with nystatin or filipin before PMA treatment, and then sequestration of GFP-PKCα, Alexa Fluor transferrin, and CD59 was examined. It was observed that inhibition of clathrin-independent endocytosis did not prevent sequestration of GFP-PKCα or transferrin to the pericentrion (Fig. 7A) (sequestration to pericentrion was still observed in ∼60% of cells, a proportion similar to control PMA-treated cells). Thus, the actions of PKC do not require the clathrin-independent pathway. Interestingly, even though both nystatin and filipin were able to inhibit basal internalization of CD59 in untreated cells (data not shown), they were not able to prevent PMA-stimulated sequestration of CD59 (Fig. 7B). In addition to nystatin and filipin, we employed methyl-β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 7C), which is known to form soluble inclusion complexes with cholesterol (28Pitha J. Irie T. Sklar P.B. Nye J.S. Life Sci. 1988; 43: 493-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) and to extract cholesterol from cells in culture (29Yancey P.G. Rodrigueza W.V. Kilsdonk E.P. Stoudt G.W. Johnson W.J.

Pretreatment for 60 min with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (10 mm) completely inhibited PMA-induced translocation of PKC to the pericentrion but not to the plasma membrane. Interestingly when cells were first treated with PMA for 1 h and then treated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin, PKC localization at the pericentrion was reversed, yet PKC remained at the plasma membrane. These results are consistent with previous reports showing that methyl-β-cyclodextrin is able to inhibit not only caveolin (31Rothberg K.G. Ying Y.S. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G. J.

They also further confirm that pericentrion formation is a clathrin-dependent process. In the present work we characterize a PKCα-dependent subset of recycling endosomes, the pericentrion. It is shown that both proteins and possibly also lipids are selectively sequestered to the juxtanuclear region when PKCα is continuously active. Interestingly, the formation of the pericentrion and sequestration of proteins and lipids to this compartment displayed a strict temperature requirement, occurring at 37 °C. This active translocation of PKCα and other membrane constituents appears to lead to the formation of a membranous structure in the perinuclear region. The present data also indicate involvement of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in PKCα sequestration to the pericentrion, although proteins that are internalized through different pathways can be also delivered to this compartment. Although the data present in this manuscript describe changes upon PMA treatment, these results raise a number of important implications as to the regulation and function of the PKC-dependent sequestration of membrane proteins and lipids with physiological agonists. An interesting and critical observation came with the realization of the strict and unusual temperature requirement for pericentrion formation. Thus, pericentrion formation did not occur at temperatures below 32 °C, emphasizing the dependence of PKCα translocation and sequestration of PKC targets on physiologic temperature. It also distinguishes this process from general endocytosis, which is only blocked below 17 °C (37Punnonen E.L. Ryhanen K. Marjomaki V.S. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1998; 75: 344-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This strict temperature dependence may explain the delayed appreciation of the perinuclear localization of PKC-dependent sequestration despite previous appreciation of PKC-dependent internalization of target molecules (see below). Although the mechanism of this strict temperature dependence is not known, it is nonetheless a critical observation that needs to be considered in investigations on internalization and recycling. The current findings, that not only certain plasma membrane proteins but possibly also specific plasma membrane lipids (such as GM1, based on results with Bodipy-GM1) are enriched in the PKC-dependent pericentrion, have implications as to the structure of the pericentrion as well as to the recycling processes affected by PKC stimulation. This ability of PKC to induce internalization and sequestration of plasma membrane lipids suggested that the site of concentration of the sequestered cargo should show membrane-related structures. Importantly, this ability of sustained stimulation of PKC to cause sequestration of both proteins and lipids clearly indicates a generalized effect of PKC on the dynamics of recycling rather than specific effects on individual proteins. For example, PKC activation has been implicated in acute receptor desensitization due to direct phosphorylation of these receptors. However, the current results show that the sustained activation of PKC affects the sequestration of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked proteins (CD59) as well as lipids, negating a role for direct phosphorylation of the target molecules and suggesting effects on lipid- and protein-containing endosomes. Therefore, these sustained effects (minutes to hours) of PKC on sequestration of endosomes should be distinguished from acute effects (seconds to minutes) on receptor desensitization. The nature of the cargo subject to PKC-dependent sequestration also begins to illuminate the specific process affected by PKC. Thus, sustained PKC stimulation resulted in sequestration of several recycling membrane proteins (CD59, transferrin receptor, and caveolin) but not molecules destined for the lysosomes (LDL, DiIC16 (3Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)) or other membrane proteins, such as flotillin, a proposed lipid raft marker that has also been seen to accumulate in maturing phagosomes (38Dermine J.F. Duclos S. Garin J. St-Louis F. Rea S. Parton R.G. Desjardins M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18507-18512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and in lysosomes and Golgi (39Kokubo H. Helms J.B. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Shimada Y. Horikoshi Y. Yamaguchi H. Brain Res. 2003; 965: 83-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Thus, this newly recognized subset of PKC-influenced cargo appears to be composed of proteins and lipids that are known to be continuously recycled in the cell and that form at least a subset of recycling endosomes. The observations that sustained activation of PKC results in close association with the Rab11 recycling compartment raises an important question on the relationship of the Rab11-positive endosome to the pericentrion. In fact, these results show that the PKC-dependent sequestration is not synonymous with the Rab11 compartment; that is, the rab11 compartment exists before and independent of PKC stimulation. Rather, PKC causes a relocation and sequestration of recycling endosomes to the Rab11 compartment. Thus, a functional definition of the pericentrion posits is as a dynamic structure whose formation from recycling endosomes is dependent on continued PKC activity. These recycling endosomes are then sequestered to the Rab11 positive compartment after sustained PKC activity. Based on the present data, we propose (Fig. 9) that PKC regulates the formation of the pericentrion and sequestration of molecules into the pericentrion by clustering of recycling endosomes in the perinuclear region. This regulation does not seem to be at the level of internalization since (a) both molecules that internalize through clathrin-dependent (transferrin, PKCα) and clathrin-independent (caveolin, CD59, Bodipy-GM1) pathways were subject to PKC-dependent sequestration and (b) sustained activation of PKC did not induce sequestration of proteins and lipids destined to the lysosomes (such as LDL and DiIC16 (3Ohno S. Nishizuka Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 132: 509-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). Because it has been proposed that the sorting of cargo between recycling endosomes and endolysosomes occurs after internalization, it becomes further unlikely that PKC acts at a more proximal step in this process of sequestration. We would also propose that the PKC-induced sequestration arises from effects of PKC on the kinetics of movement of recycling endosomes rather than causing a “terminal” event in the life cycle of recycling endosomes. This is supported by the multiple data that show the reversibility of the process and the requirement for ongoing activation of PKC. Thus, formation of the pericentrion was reversed when cells were taken from 37 to 30 °C (or 4 °C) and became reconstituted once the temperature was restored to 37 °C. Moreover, the process was reversed when PKC inhibitors were added after formation of the pericentrion, demonstrating not only the reversibility of the process but also the strict requirement for continued activity of PKC. Finally, the ability of methyl cyclodextrin to undo PKC-dependent translocation and sequestration after formation of the pericentrion suggests that the effects at the plasma membrane affect the ability of PKC to maintain the formation of the pericentrion. This further supports the conjecture that PKC action is to affect the dynamics of recycling with a resulting profound slowing that appears as “trapping” of recycling endosomes at the pericentrion (Fig. 9). At this point, we are unable to distinguish whether the action of PKC is to accelerate the afferent limb or inhibit the efferent limb of recycling (Fig. 9). The observation that internalization of PKCα and formation of pericentrion after PMA treatment was clathrin-dependent may appear contradictory to previous work (40Mineo C. Ying Y.S. Chapline C. Jaken S. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) showing that PKCα was localized to caveolae. Interestingly, however, Smart et al. (41Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) observed that PKC can be displaced from caveoli after treatment with phorbol esters (41Smart E.J. Ying Y.S. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that treatment with PMA leads to a relocalization of PKC to the clathrin-dependent pathway followed by internalization and sequestration in a caveoli-independent manner. The results from this study coupled with other published studies begin to suggest important roles for the PKC-dependent sequestration of membrane proteins and lipids. Indeed, there are several examples in the literature showing PKC-dependent sequestration of molecules such as the dopamine transporter (14Melikian H.E. Buckley K.M. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 7699-7710Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Loder M.K. Melikian H.E. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 1641-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar)) to a compartment that resembles the pericentrion. Although those studies focused on specific PKC/target interaction, our results would suggest that the effects of PKC in those cases as well may be part of the more generalized effects on recycling endosomes described in this study. Thus, such sequestration would provide important regulating events that depend on the presence of these proteins on the cell surface. It is also possible that this mechanism may provide for redirecting the action of some of these targets from the plasma membrane to the perinuclear region. In conclusion these studies demonstrate the existence of a PKC-dependent sequestration of recycling proteins and possibly also lipids to the pericentrion. Formation of the pericentrion is clathrin-dependent, has strict temperature requirements, and coincides with the formation of membranous structure in a perinuclear region. Moreover these findings provide novel insights into previously observed PKC-dependent sequestration of molecules. We thank Dr. Chiara Luberto for careful reading of the manuscript.

https://openalex.org/W2065540956,"Ku80 maintains the genome by repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) through nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), a pathway that repairs nonspecific DSBs and Rag-1 Rag-2 (Rag)-specific DSBs. As a result, Ku80 deletion results in phenotypes characteristic of defective repair for both nonspecific DSBs (γ-radiation hypersensitivity and genomic instability) and Rag-specific DSBs (immunodeficiency). ku80−/− mice also exhibit neuronal apoptosis, but we do not know the type of DSBs responsible for this response. In spite of genomic instability and immunodeficiency, cancer incidence is not increased in ku80−/− mice. However, deletion of the tumor suppressor, p53 greatly increases pro-B-cell lymphoma in ku80−/− mice due to IgH/c-Myc translocations suggesting that responses to Rag-specific DNA DSBs suppress cancer. Like suppression of pro-B-cell lymphoma, neuronal apoptosis requires p53 presenting the intriguing possibility that Rag-specific DSBs mediate neuronal development as they do lymphocyte development. Here we delete Rag-1 from ku80−/−p53−/− mice to differentiate the impact nonspecific vs Rag-specific DSBs have on ku80−/− mice. We find that deleting Rag-1 prevents pro-B cell lymphoma confirming Rag-induced DSBs induce this form of cancer. Both the triple mutant mice and the p53−/−rag-1−/− mice exhibit T-cell lymphoma and medulloblastoma; incidence of T-cell lymphoma is the same for both cohorts whereas incidence of medulloblastoma is higher for the triple-mutant cohort. Thus, p53-mediated neuronal apoptosis likely suppresses medulloblastoma in Ku80-deleted mice and Ku80 likely suppresses medulloblastoma by repairing nonspecific DNA DSBs instead of Rag-specific DSBs. Our observations are the first to show that Ku80 suppresses cancer caused by nonspecific DNA damage and we present a novel mouse model for medulloblastoma."

Insulin, a small globular protein secreted by pancreatic β cells, plays a central role in the control of vertebrate metabolism (1Dodson G. Steiner D. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The hormone is stored in glucose-regulated secretory granules as microcrystalline arrays of Zn2+-stabilized hexamers (2Michael J.

These conformations differ in the secondary structure of B1-B8, extended in the T state and α-helical in the R state. The TR transition is also characterized by a change in the handedness of cystine A7-B7; the sulfur atoms of the latter are exposed in the T state but buried in a nonpolar crevice in the R state. We speculate that coupling between the B8 φ angle and handedness of cystine A7-B7 may account for the low yield of chain combination in synthesis of analogs containing l-amino acid substitutions at B8.

Structure-function relationships have been extensively investigated (for review, see Ref. 11De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The B chain of insulin contains two β-turns (boxed in Fig. 1A, see below). The first is a type-II′ β-turn comprising residues B7-B10 (black box); the second is a type-I β-turn comprising residues B20-B23 (red box; ball-and-stick model in Fig. 1B).

These residues exhibit positive φ angles (“d-glycines”) and, therefore, reside on the right side of the Ramachandran plane in regions unfavorable for l-amino acids. GlyB8, which adjoins the A7-B7 inter-chain disulfide bridge, is invariant among vertebrate insulins and highly conserved among insulin-related growth factors (black box in Fig. 1C). Mutations at B8 markedly impair the stability of insulin and the yield of chain combination (12Zhang B. Chang A. Kjeldsen T.B. Arvan P. J.

In this report we employ “chiral mutagenesis” to investigate the B20-B23 β-turn. The turn sequence is notable for conserved negative and positive charges (GluB21 and ArgB22 in eutherian mammals) flanked by glycines (Fig. 1C). Experimental design is motivated by the pattern of main-chain dihedral angles (Table 1). To investigate the interrelation of structure, activity, and stability, isomeric analogs have been synthesized in which GlyB20 or GlyB23 is substituted by d- or l-Ala; control substitutions have likewise been introduced at B21. Characterization of corresponding d- and l-Ala analogs demonstrates a wide spectrum of stereospecific perturbations, enabling residue-specific decomposition of turn function. Whereas the main-chain conformation and negative charge of GluB21 are of marginal importance, consistent with previous studies (17Wang C.C. Tsou C.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 279-281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), GlyB20 and GlyB23 make key yet complementary contributions: a d-conformation at B20 enhances stability, whereas that at B23 is essential for receptor recognition. l-Ala substitutions at either position impede disulfide pairing. Together, these results illuminate the critical contributions of a conserved β-turn to the folding, stability, and function of insulin.TABLE 1Dihedral angles in crystal structuresResidueΦψGlyB2055.9 ± 6.9−138.7 ± 7.0GluB21−59.2 ± 14.7−19.3 ± 13.2ArgB22−67.8 ± 5.6−35.7 ± 7.5GlyB2384.1 ± 8.6−178.8 ± 4.6 Open table in a new tab Materials—Human insulin and des-octapeptide(B23-B30)-AspB10-insulin were provided by Eli Lilly and Co.

The molecular weight of each analog was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE, Applied Biosystems) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis performed on an Agilent 1100 system (Germany) with a Microsorb C18 column (2.1 × 50 mm) using on-line electrospray mass detection. Peptides were eluted from the columns using an appropriate gradient between acetonitrile (+0.08% trifluoroacetic acid) and water (+0.1% trifluoroacetic acid).

Asparagine, glutamine, and arginine were activated as the corresponding 1-hydroxybenzotriazole esters; all other amino acids were activated as the corresponding symmetric anhydrides. All amino acid residues were subjected to double coupling (19Hu S.Q. Burke G.T. Schwartz G.P. Ferderigos N. Ross J.B. Katsoyannis P.G.

The N-t-Boc-O-benzylthreonine-4-hydroxymethylphenylacetamidomethyl resin (0.5 mmol) was elongated to the residue B24, the resulting peptidyl resin was divided into four equal parts, and the synthesis was continued separately for each part to complete the B-chain sequence with an amino acid residue substituted for glycine at position B20 or B23. After removal of the Boc group from the PheB1, the peptidyl resins were subjected to hydrogen flouride cleavage with 10% anisole (v/v) at −5 °C for 45 min (23Sakakibara S. Shimonishi Y. Kishida Y. Okada M. Sugihara H. Bull. Chem. Soc. Jpn. 1967; 40: 2164-2167Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The dried mixture of resin and peptide was washed with ethyl acetate and then treated with sodium sulfite and sodium tetrathionate in 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.6) containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride for oxidative sulfitolysis of sulfhydryl groups (3 h at room temperature (24Bailey J.L.

After removal of resin by filtration and subsequent dialysis (molecular mass cut off, 1000 Da) of the filtrate against water for 1 day, the crude peptide B-chain di-S-sulfonates were purified by a combination of gel filtration (on Bio-Gel P-4 or P-6) in 0.1 m NH4CO3 and preparative reverse-phase HPLC on C4 or C18 columns.

Each analog was purified by size-exclusion chromatography (B20 and B23 analogs, Bio-Gel P-4 in 3 m acetic acid) or ion-exchange chromatography (B21 analogs, CM52 cellulose in 24 mm sodium acetate (pH 3.3) with an elution gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl). Proteins in fractions corresponding to the molecular weight of insulin were pooled and freeze-dried. The crude peptides thus obtained were further purified by reverse-phase HPLC on C4 or C18 columns. Fidelity of synthesis was in each case verified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

Open table in a new tab Semi-synthesis of l-AlaB23-DKP-Insulin—Because of the low yield of AlaB23-DKP-insulin on chain combination (above), additional material was prepared by a trypsin-catalyzed semisynthetic method that circumvents the inefficiency of disulfide pairing (26Inouye K.

Protein Res. 1986; 27: 514-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In brief, des-octapeptide(B23-B30)-AspB10-insulin (15 mg), synthetic octapeptide (Ala-Phe-Phe-Tyr-Thr-Lys-Pro-Thr, 20 mg), and l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethel chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin (1.5 mg) were dissolved in a mixture of dimethylacetamide/1,4-butandiol/0.2 m Tris acetate (pH 8) containing 10 mm calcium acetate and 1 mm EDTA (35:35:30, v/v, 0.4 ml). The final pH of the mixture was adjusted to 7.0 with 10 μl of N-methylmorpholine and incubated at 12 °C for 2 days. An additional aliquot of enzyme (1.5 mg) was added after 1 day. The reaction mixture was acidified and purified by preparative reverse-phase HPLC (C4) with a final yield of 5.6 mg. Receptor Binding Assays—Relative activity is defined as the ratio of analog to wild-type human insulin required to displace 50% of specifically bound 125I-human insulin. A human placental membrane preparation containing the IR was employed as described (28Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X. Jia W. Nakagawa S.H. Chu Y.-C. Hu S.-Q. Katsoyannis P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40018-40024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In all assays the percentage of tracer bound in the absence of competing ligand was <15% to avoid ligand-depletion artifacts. Assays were repeated three to five times (legend to Table 2). Changes in relative receptor-binding affinities were converted to changes in free energy of binding (ΔΔGb in kcal/mole) according to the equation, ΔGb =-RT ln(Keq). CD Spectroscopy—Far-UV CD spectra were obtained using a thermister-controlled Aviv spectropolarimeter equipped with an automated titration unit for guanidine denaturation studies. Spectra (repeated twice) were obtained of samples containing 25-50 μm insulin analog in 10 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) and 50 mm KCl at 4 °C. Equilibrium denaturation studies were conducted at 4 and 25 °C. Estimates of secondary structure were obtained by deconvolution (64Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 209: 32-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). Samples were diluted to 5 μm; guanidine-HCl was employed as the denaturant (29Hua Q.-X. Chu Y.-C. Jia W. Phillips N.F.B. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic Modeling—Guanidine denaturation data were fitted by non-linear least squares to a two-state model (30Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, CD data θ(x), where x indicates the concentration of denaturant, were fitted by a nonlinear least-squares program according to Equation 1,θ(x)=θA+θBe(-ΔGH200-mx)/RT1+e-(ΔGH200-mx)/RT(Eq. 1) where x is the concentration of guanidine hydrochloride and where θA and θB are baseline values in the native and unfolded states. These baselines were approximated by pre- and post-transition lines θA(x)=θAH20+mAx and θB(x)=θBH20+mBx . Fitting the original CD data and baselines simultaneously circumvents artifacts associated with linear plots of ΔG as a function of denaturant according to ΔG0(x)=ΔGH200+m0x (30Sosnick T.R. Fang X. Shelton V.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 317: 393-409Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Overview of Experimental Design—The B20-B23 β-turn adjoins the A20 -B19 disulfide bridge and is interposed between two critical receptor-recognition elements (11De Meyts P. Whittaker J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), the central α-helix and its C-terminal β-strand of the B chain (Fig. 1). The location and broad conservation of this turn suggest important roles in folding or function. Our studies focus on d-glycines at positions B20 and B23. Molecular models suggest that d- or l-Ala substitutions at these sites would be well accommodated on the surface of a native-like structure (see supplemental material). Synthesis—Seven analogs of DKP-insulin containing substitutions at positions B20, B21, or B23 were prepared by total chemical synthesis (Table 2). Incorporation of the three “DKP” substitutions in the B chain enabled study of β-turn variants in a uniform monomeric context (20Shoelson S.E. Lu Z.X. Parlautan L. Lynch C.S. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This framework facilitates interpretation of physical studies as otherwise apparent effects of β-turn substitutions could be influenced by associated perturbations in self-assembly (31Huang K. Xu B. Hu S.Q. Chu Y.C. Hua Q.X. Qu Y. Li B. Wang S. Wang R.Y. Nakagawa S.H. Theede A.M. Whittaker J. De Meyts P. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 341: 529-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The activity of DKP-insulin is ∼2-fold higher than that of human insulin (20Shoelson S.E. Lu Z.X. Parlautan L. Lynch C.S. Weiss M.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1757-1767Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Broad experience with DKP-insulin analogs indicates that effects of additional substitutions on receptor binding mirror those of the same substitutions in wild-type insulin. Synthetic yields, reflecting the efficiency of disulfide pairing in chain combination (29Hua Q.-X. Chu Y.-C. Jia W. Phillips N.F.B. Wang R.-Y. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), varied over a 7-fold range (Table 2). Whereas high yields were obtained in syntheses of d-AlaB20 and d-AlaB23 analogs, low yields were observed in corresponding l-Ala syntheses. The yield of l-AlaB20-DKP-insulin was impaired to an extent similar to that previously observed in the biosynthetic expression of a corresponding single-chain analog (l-AlaB20-mini-proinsulin) in S. cerevisiae (18Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). By contrast, 2-fold-reduced yields were obtained without stereospecificity in control syntheses of d-AlaB21- and l-AlaB21-DKP-insulin (Table 2), also consistent (in the case of l-AlaB21) with biosynthetic experience (18Kristensen C. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Schaffer L. Hach M. Havelund S. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Andersen A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12978-12983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Chiral inversion of the B21 α-carbon (i.e. substitution of the native l-GluB21 by d-GluB21) also resulted in a 2-fold lower yield. The marked stereospecific differences in yield among B20 and B23 analogs were remarkable in relation to prior syntheses of unstable and partially unfolded A-chain variants in which yields were essentially unaffected (5G-DKP-insulin and DKP-des-[A6-A11]) (Table 2) (5Hua Q.X. Hu S.Q. Frank B.H. Jia W. Chu Y.C. Wang S.H. Burke G.T. Katsoyannis P.G. Weiss M.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 390-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Weiss M.A. Hua Q.-X. Jia W. Chu Y.-C.

Chem. 2002; 277: 43443-43453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The latter analogs contained substitutions in the N-terminal segment of the A chain (see legend to Table 2) that are remote from the B20-B23 β-turn. To circumvent the inefficiency of disulfide pairing encountered in the synthesis of l-AlaB23-DKP-insulin, additional material was prepared by semi-synthesis using a preformed insulin framework (des(B23-B30)-AspB10-insulin; see “Experimental Procedures”); this protocol does not apply to B20 analogs. Structure and Stability—Far-UV CD spectra of the analogs were in each case similar to that of DKP-insulin (Fig. 2). Spectra of the B20 analogs (Fig. 2A), B21 analogs (Fig. 3B), and B23 analogs (Fig. 2C) in each case approximated the parent spectrum (blue line in each panel). Values of mean residue ellipticity at helix-sensitive wavelengths ([θ] at 196, 208, and 222 nm) are given in Table 3A. Whereas stereospecific spectral differences were not significant at B20 and B21 (Fig. 2, A and B, respectively), the spectrum of d-AlaB23-insulin (black line in Fig. 2C) exhibited an accentuation of mean residue ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm (Table 3A). This accentuation was not due to a change in protein concentration, because the normalized spectrum, exhibiting a subtle change in overall shape, did not differ from the parent spectrum by a uniform scaling factor. Despite increased ellipticity at 208 and 222 nm, their ratio is similar to that of DKP-insulin (Table 3); further, deconvolution of the spectrum of d-AlaB23-DKP-insulin did not suggest an increase in α-helix content (Table 3B). Because residue B23 is located at the junction of a β-turn and β-strand and so does not li"
https://openalex.org/W1995537492,"Central to our understanding of human immunodeficiency virus-induced fusion is the high resolution structure of fragments of the gp41 fusion protein folded in a low energy core conformation. However, regions fundamental to fusion, like the fusion peptide (FP), have yet to be characterized in the context of the cognate protein regardless of its conformation. Based on conformation-specific monoclonal antibody recognition, we identified the polar region consecutive to the N36 fragment as a stabilizer of trimeric coiled-coil assembly, thereby enhancing inhibitory potency. This tertiary organization is retained in the context of the hydrophobic FP (N70 fragment). Our data indicate that the N70 fragment recapitulates the expected organization of this region in the viral fusion intermediate (N-terminal half of the pre-hairpin intermediate (N-PHI)), which happens to be the prime target for fusion inhibitors. Regarding the low energy conformation, we show for the first time core formation in the context of the FP (N70 core). The α-helical and coiled-coil stabilizing polar region confers substantial thermal stability to the core, whereas the hydrophobic FP does not add further stability. For the two key fusion conformations, N-PHI and N70 core, we find that the FP adopts a nonhelical structure and directs higher order assembly (assembly of coiled coils in N-PHI and assembly of bundles in the N70 core). This supra-molecular organization of coiled coils or folded cores is seen only in the context of the FP.

Despite extensive efforts to characterize gp41, high resolution structures lack the N-terminal and membrane-active fusion peptide (FP) region, and our understanding of this fundamentally essential region is likewise limited. Prior to fusion, gp41 is held in a metastable state by the surface subunit gp120, and the complex is organized as a trimer visualized as spikes on the virion surface (11Center R.J. Leapman R.D. Lebowitz J. Arthur L.O. Earl P.L. Moss B. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7863-7867Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Following receptors binding by gp120, gp41 is freed from metastable constraints (12Jones P.L. Korte T. Blumenthal R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and adopts an extended conformation (pre-hairpin intermediate (PHI)) characterized by exposed NHR and CHR regions (8Bewley C.A. Louis J.M. Ghirlando R. Clore G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14238-14245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 13Furuta R.A. Wild C.T. Weng Y. Weiss C.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 276-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Collapse of the PHI into a thermostable six-helix bundle (SHB) or core conformation, formed by packing of CHR helices in an anti-parallel manner into hydrophobic grooves of the NHR trimeric parallel coiled coil (1Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar), is believed to draw together viral and cell membranes, which is a requirement for fusion. Although core folding is a critical step, the exact details of how gp41 carries out fusion have yet to be elucidated. A hydrophobic stretch of ∼16 residues at the N terminus of the gp41 fusion protein, termed the fusion peptide (FP), is regarded as fundamentally involved in fusion, although little is known of its structure or role in the context of gp41. Early on, the FP was recognized as essential to the process of fusion based on mutational analysis (14Freed E.O. Myers D.J. Risser R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4650-4654Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 15Freed E.O. Delwart E.L. Buchschacher Jr., G.L. Panganiban A.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, biophysical characterization of this critical region remains hampered by the inability to efficiently express gp41, due primarily to the toxicity of the free N-terminal FP region. Our present understanding of FP structure and function is based on FP-containing fragments amenable to chemical synthesis. The tendency of free FP-containing fragments to aggregate in solution is well documented (17Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol.

Consequently, the behavior of FP-containing fragments in membranes has been extensively studied, revealing that they readily bind and insert into model membranes (17Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D.

J. 2004; 87: 1951-1963Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Based on these functions, the FP region of gp41 is believed to insert into the target cell membrane, likely during an early gp41 fusion conformation (PHI), and to play a role in membrane destabilization thereby priming the target membrane for architectural rearrangements required for transition to hemi- and full fusion states with the apposed viral membrane. The tendency of the FP to self-assemble in membranes is the basis for the ability of exogenous FP-containing fragments to inhibit in vivo fusion by oligomerizing with viral FP, thereby inhibiting proper assembly of viral gp41 required for fusion (17Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13496-13505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, it is believed that the FP self-assembles in membranes, directing higher order oligomerization of gp41 trimers at the fusion locus. The molecular mechanism of FP self-assembly in membranes is based on in-register parallel β-sheet organization of the hydrophobic N-terminal stretch (∼16 residues) (27Sackett K. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 350: 790-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The robust oligomerization interface created by the extended parallel β-sheet of the hydrophobic FP in membranes is believed to provide the seed for supramolecular gp41 organization or alternatively for interference in the presence of exogenous FP-containing fragments. Adjacent to the N-terminal FP is the NHR region, which is an auto-oligomerization domain (28Bernstein H.B. Tucker S.P. Kar S.R. McPherson S.A. McPherson D.T. Dubay J.W. Lebowitz J. Compans R.W. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2745-2750Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) directing parallel trimeric coiled-coil organization in gp41 (1Chan D.C. Fass D. Berger J.M. Kim P.S. Cell. 1997; 89: 263-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). In model systems, the NHR significantly boosts the fusogenic function of the FP, for consecutive FP/NHR fragments (24Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), in part by pre-organizing the FP region (29Wexler-Cohen Y. Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 5853-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The β-structure adopted by the FP in membranes, when stabilized by the NHR, is likely that which is required during viral fusion (30Sackett K. Shai Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 333: 47-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FP/NHR constructs model the N-terminal half of the PHI conformation (target of commercially available fusion inhibitor, Fuzeon), provide information on functional synergy between distinctly different regions of gp41 (24Sackett K. Shai Y. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 4678-4685Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and may be useful for screening fusion inhibitors. A basic gap in our understanding of HIV fusion centers on the role of the viral fusion peptide, for distinct gp41 conformations, during fusion. This study characterizes the FP region in the context of the folded core and the N-terminal half of the PHI in solution. Using CD, we analyzed core formation between free peptides corresponding to the CHR (C34) and different N-peptides. N-peptides include the NHR (N36) and extensions of N36 to include the following: (i) the adjacent polar region (17-70) or (ii) complete N-terminal extension to include polar and hydrophobic FP regions (N70) (see Fig. 1). Core stability was analyzed by following thermal denaturation. Native gels were used to analyze the oligomerization character of the various folded cores and the free peptides that constitute them. Propensity of the N-peptides to spontaneously form trimeric coiled coils was monitored using a conformation-specific monoclonal antibody. NHR peptides soluble at physiologic pH were compared for their ability to inhibit gp41-induced cell-cell fusion. We discuss sequence- and structure-specific determinants toward both coiled-coil and core stability. This study is the first to analyze the fusion peptide in the context of the folded core. Materials—Boc and Fmoc amino acids, Boc MBHA resin, and Fmoc rink amide MBHA resin were purchased from Novabiochem. S-Trityl-β-mercaptopropionic acid was purchased from Peptides International (Louisville, KY). Other reagents for peptide synthesis, TCEP, the sodium salt of 2-mercaptoethanesulfonic acid (MESNA), proteinase K, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) were purchased from Sigma. 5-(and -6)-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine, succinimidyl ester, was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other reagents were of analytic grade. Buffers were prepared using double glass-distilled water. Cell Lines and Reagents—Cell culture reagents and media were from Biological Industries, Israel (Beit-Haemek Ltd.). Steady-Glow Luciferase detection kit was from Promega (Madison, WI). HL2/3 cells (31Ciminale V. Felber B.K. Campbell M. Pavlakis G.N. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 1281-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) (a HeLa cell line) expressing cleaved HIV-1 molecular clone HXB2/3gpt (containing HIV-1 Gag, Env, Tat, Rev, and Nef proteins) were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program from Dr. Barbara Felber and Dr. George Pavlakis. The TZM-bl indicator HeLa cell line (32Wei X. Decker J.M. Liu H. Zhang Z. Arani R.B. Kilby J.M. Saag M.S. Wu X. Shaw G.M. Kappes J.C. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2002; 46: 1896-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1330) Google Scholar), which expresses high levels of CD4 and CCR5 along with endogenously expressed CXCR4, was obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, National Institutes of Health from Dr. John C. Kappes, Dr. Xiaoyun Wu, and Tranzyme, Inc. The cells were cultured every 3–4 days by trypsinization and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. Peptide Synthesis and Fluorescent Labeling—All peptides used in this study, including those chemically ligated to produce longer constructs, were synthesized by solid phase methodology. The “linker peptides” (34-residue N-terminal fragment as well as fragment spanning residues 17–34) were synthesized by a manual solid phase method on MBHA resin using Boc chemistry as described previously (33Shai Y. Bach D. Yanovsky A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20202-20209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Merrifield R.B. Vizioli L.D. Boman H.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5020-5031Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), with modifications outlined by Hackeng et al. (35Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10068-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), required for inclusion of the linker moiety (S-trityl-β-mercaptopropionic acid). The peptides N36, C34, and 17-34 were acetylated at the N terminus. In addition, some 17-34 was labeled at the N terminus with rhodamine (17-34Rho) as described previously (36Rapaport D. Shai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6502-6509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to be used in subsequent ligation. All peptides except linker peptides were amidated at the C terminus. Boc peptides were cleaved from the resin by HF. All other peptides were synthesized by an Fmoc solid phase method on rink amide MBHA resin, using an ABI 433A automatic peptide synthesizer, and then cleaved from the resin using a mixture made of trifluoroacetic acid:double distilled water:TES (18.5:1:0.5 (v/v)). All peptides were purified by reverse phase-HPLC on a C4 Bio-Rad semi-preparative column to >98% homogeneity, and the mass of each peptide was confirmed by platform LCA electrospray mass spectrometry. Native Chemical Ligation—N70 was prepared by ligating 1-34 “linker” with N36(S35C); 17-70 was prepared by ligating 17-34 linker with N36(S35C), and N-terminal rhodamine-labeled 17-70 (17-70Rho) was prepared by ligating 17-34Rho with N36(S35C). The ligation of unprotected fragments was carried out as described (35Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Dawson P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10068-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) with the following alterations. 1) We used MESNA as the catalyst (37Evans Jr., T.C. Benner J. Xu M.Q. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2256-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) (2). Prior to addition of lyophilized peptides, the pH of the reaction mixture, made of 6.0 m guanidine HCl, 0.1 m Na2HPO4, and 1% MESNA (w/v), was adjusted to ∼7.2 using 1 m NaOH (3). Ligations were carried out at peptide concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 0.8 mm (4). The various ligations were incubated over a range of temperatures, from 4 to 37 °C, and for a period of 4–5 days. For each ligation, the product resolved as a single isolated peak and was purified to >98% homogeneity using reverse phase-HPLC. Product identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry. CD—Free peptides at 10 μm, or mixtures of N- and C-peptides at 10 μm each, were prepared by dialysis overnight against reference buffer (50 mm sodium formate with 50 μm TCEP, pH 3.0) prior to measurements. CD spectra were recorded at 25 °C in a quartz cuvette on an Aviv 202 spectropolarimeter at 1 nm increments, 10 s averaging time, and in triplicate. The signal of buffer alone was subtracted from the averaged triplicate signals of sample in buffer. Buffer corrected spectra for between 2 and 5 different sets of samples were averaged for each peptide alone and mixture. Following spectral acquisition, thermal melts were recorded at 222 nm wavelength and were based on the following parameters: temperature range (25–105 °C), temperature step of 2 °C, 20-s averaging time, 2-min incubation prior to each measurement, and 1-min ramp for each 2 °C temperature increase. α-Helical content was estimated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm by the value expected for 100% helix formation (−33,000 degrees cm2 dmol−1) (38Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar). Native Gel and Western Blot—10% polyacrylamide continuous native gels at pH 3.4 were prepared. Gels were cast using 30 mm β-alanine and 42 mm formic acid and then pre-run in the same 30 mm β-alanine, 42 mm formic acid running buffer containing 100 μm TCEP as a reducing agent. The free peptides and pre-formed cores were prepared under identical conditions as those used for CD measurements, except 10% glycerol was added prior to loading. Identical gels were run in parallel (differing only in the amounts loaded), and complementary gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred by Western blot to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with NC-1 monoclonal mouse primary antibody (kind gift of Dr. Shibo Jiang) and then with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Bound NC-1 was monitored using the ECL-based “Phototope-HRP Western Blot Detection System” from Cell Signaling Technology. The amounts of peptides or preformed cores loaded (from 0.35 to 10 μg) were calibrated based on both Coomassie Blue stain and reactivity with NC-1 mAb (see Fig. 3 legend). Fusion Assay—Fusion was monitored by using a reporter gene assay based on activation of HIV long terminal repeat-driven luciferase cassette in TZM-bl (Target) cells by HIV-1 tat from the HL2/3 (Effector) cells. Fusion assays were performed in a serum-free medium to minimize nonspecific association of peptides with serum proteins. N36 was solubilized in Me2SO, whereas 17-70 was solubilized in Me2SO with 10× molar DTT at all dilutions. The TZM-bl cells, plated in 96-well clusters (2.5 × 104 per well) overnight at 37 °C, were placed in 50 μl of serum-free medium per well prior to fusion assays. The target cells were co-cultured with 50 μl of HL2/3 cells (2.5 × 104 per well in serum-free medium) for 6 h at 37 °C in the presence or absence of various concentrations of peptides (1 μl of peptide per well). Efficiency of fusion was determined by measuring luciferase activity in the wells following the manufacturer's instructions using the steady-glow luciferase determination kit (Promega, Madison, WI). The light intensity was measured using VICTOR2 1420 multilabel counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Background luminescence in TZM-bl cells was determined without addition of HL2/3 cells. Fluorescence Assay—The N-terminally rhodamine-labeled 17-70 (17-70Rho) was initially dissolved in a small volume of MeOH and DTT at 20× molar excess and then diluted with PBS containing 1 μm DTT at physiologic pH. 17-70Rho dilutions ranged from 2 μm to 16 nm and contained a maximum of 2% MeOH at the highest concentration that was serially diluted in the lower concentrations. Samples were equilibrated overnight in the dark, and fluorescence was measured on a SLM-AMINCO Bowman series 2 luminescence spectrometer with excitation set at 530 nm and emission set at 580 nm. Measurements were carried out in duplicate, and then proteinase K was added to a final concentration of 62 ng/μl, and samples were allowed to incubate for 7 h in the dark with subsequent re-measurement of fluorescence. This study describes the contribution of the FP-containing region (N-terminal 34 residues of gp41) toward stability of the well characterized HIV SHB (N36/C34 core). We further demarcate the N-terminal 34-residue region into the canonical FP, which constitutes the highly hydrophobic N-terminal 16 residues (hydrophobic or FP region), and the adjoining polar stretch of residues 17-34 (polar region). Fig. 1 outlines the gp41 fragments used in this study. Because of its large hydrophobic contribution, especially in a trimeric organization, the FP region significantly affects the solubility of both the N70 free peptide and its corresponding N70/C34 core complex in solution. Therefore, free peptides and folded cores were prepared at pH 3.0 in 50 mm formate buffer (solubility of N70 and N70/C34 core at least 30 μm). It has been shown previously that the structure and oligomerization state of gp41 are not affected by low pH (39Caffrey M. Kaufman J. Stahl S. Wingfield P. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1904-1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Core Formation in Context of the Fusion Peptide—To analyze the effect of the polar and hydrophobic FP regions on core formation, we employed CD to follow the ability of free N- and C-peptides to form cores. C34 was the constitutive C-peptide for all mixes of N- and C-peptides. Core formation is qualitatively determined by induction of α-helical signal (primarily in unstructured C34) upon mixing of N- and C-peptides (17Kliger Y. Aharoni A. Rapaport D. Jones P. Blumenthal R.

Sackett K. Rawat S.S. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Fig. 2A compares the additive CD spectra of free peptides versus the spectra of mixed peptides (Fig. 2, A1–A3). We show the N36/C34 core (Fig. 2A1) as a positive control to indicate that at low pH this core forms at physiologic pH, as we have shown previously (42Gallo S.A. Sackett K. Rawat S.S. Shai Y. Blumenthal R. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 340: 9-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This is supported by the fact that the analogous simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 folds into an SHB core in either pH 7.5 (43Malashkevich V.N. Chan D.C. Chutkowski C.T. Kim P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9134-9139Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) or 3.0 (44Caffrey M. Cai M. Kaufman J. Stahl S.J. Wingfield P.T. Covell D.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4572-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) solutions. As we extend the N-peptide N-terminally, we see inducible core formation. The 17-70 core represents an extension of N36 to include the “polar” intervening region (Fig. 2A2). The N70 core represents an extension of N36 to the N terminus of gp41, which includes both polar and hydrophobic FP regions (Fig. 2A3).

https://openalex.org/W1993507282,"Deregulation of cyclin E expression and/or high levels have been reported in a variety of tumors and have been used as indicators of poor prognosis. Although the role that cyclin E plays in tumorigenesis remains unclear, there is evidence that it confers genomic instability when deregulated in cultured cells. Here we show that deregulated expression of a hyperstable allele of cyclin E in mice heterozygous for p53 synergistically increases mammary tumorigenesis more than that in mice carrying either of these markers individually. Most tumors and tumor-derived cell lines demonstrated loss of p53 heterozygosity. Furthermore, this tumor susceptibility is related to the number of times the transgene is induced indicating that it is directly attributable to the expression of the cyclin E transgene. An indirect assay indicates that loss of p53 function is an early event occurring in the mammary epithelia of midlactation mammary glands in which cyclin E is deregulated long before evidence of malignancy. These data support the hypothesis that deregulated expression of cyclin E stimulates p53 loss of heterozygosity by promoting genomic instability and provides specific evidence for this in vivo. Cyclin E deregulation and p53 loss are characteristics often observed in human breast carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W1984318247,"The gene defective in fidget mice encodes fidgetin, a member of the AAA (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family of ATPases. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified cAMP-dependent protein kinase A anchoring protein 95 kDa (AKAP95) as a potential fidgetin-binding protein. Epitope-tagged fidgetin co-localized with endogenous AKAP95 in the nuclear matrix, and the physical interaction between fidgetin and AKAP95 was further confirmed by reciprocal immunoprecipitation. To evaluate the biological significance of the fidgetin-AKAP95 binding, we created AKAP95 mutant mice through a gene trap strategy. Akap95 mutant mice are surprisingly viable with no overt phenotype. However, a significant number of mice carrying both Akap95 and fidget mutations die soon after birth due to cleft palate, consistent with the overlapping expression of AKAP95 and fidgetin in the branchial arches during mouse embryogenesis. These results expand the spectrum of the pleiotropic phenotypes of fidget mice and provide new leads on the in vivo function of AKAP95.

These results expand the spectrum of the pleiotropic phenotypes of fidget mice and provide new leads on the in vivo function of AKAP95. The fidget mutation is an autosomal recessive mutation (1Gruneberg H. J. Genet. 1943; 45: 22-28Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar) that causes multiple developmental defects, including reduced or absent semicircular canals (2Truslove G.M. J. Genet. 1956; 54: 64-86Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), insufficient growth of the retinal neural epithelium (3Konyukhov B.V. Sazhina M.V. Dev. Biol. 1976; 54: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and abnormal bone development (2Truslove G.M. J. Genet. 1956; 54: 64-86Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A viral retrotransposon insertion in the second intron of the fidgetin gene (Fign) was identified as the molecular lesion, interfering with the normal splicing of the Fign transcript and thus leading to significantly reduced expression of this gene (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Fidgetin is a member of the AAA 3The abbreviations used are: AAA, ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities; AKAP95, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A anchoring protein 95 kDa; B6, C57BL/6J; ES, embryonic stem; HA95, homologous to AKAP95; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Shh, sonic hedgehog; HA, hemag-glutinin; NLS, nuclear localization signals; E, embryonic day. (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) family proteins that are chaperones mediating the assembly and disassembly of macro-protein complexes. AAA proteins are involved in a variety of cellular activities such as membrane fusion, vesicle-mediated transport, proteasome function, peroxisome biogenesis, and microtubule regulation (5Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). All family members share a highly conserved AAA domain of 230 amino acids present in one or two copies in each protein (5Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Structural studies reveal that AAA proteins function as oligomers, often forming homo- or hetero-hexameric rings (6Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 150: F13-F19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Computational analysis based on the peptide sequence of fidgetin suggests that fidgetin belongs to the subfamily-7 of AAA proteins, a group without a unifying set of cellular functions (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 7Frickey T. Lupas A.N. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Fidgetin is the first AAA protein whose mutation leads to mammalian developmental abnormalities. Robust expression of fidgetin was observed in the sites of defects seen in the affected mice (otocyst, optic cup, and pelvic anlage) from mid-to-late gestation, indicating a putative role in embryogenesis (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Mouse fidgetin contains an Asp → Ser substitution within the highly conserved AAA domain, suggesting that it is not an ATPase based on computational modeling (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 5Lupas A.N. Martin J. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 746-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Recently, a Caenorhabditis elegans fidgetin ortholog, F32D1.1, was shown to possess ATPase activity with cysteine residue 368 being critical for ATP hydrolysis (8Yakushiji Y. Yamanaka K. Ogura T. FEBS Lett. 2004; 578: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). However, F32D1.1 does not possess the Asp → Ser substitution at the correlating position; therefore, whether fidgetin is an ATPase remains to be further investigated. Recent results indicated that fidgetin is a nuclear protein with the potential to form homo-oligomers (9Yang Y. Mahaffey C.L. Berube N. Nystuen A. Frankel W.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Despite these efforts, the cellular function of fidgetin and thus the biochemical disease mechanism of this mutation still remain unknown. Since it has been proposed that the specific function of a given AAA protein is primarily dependent upon the identity of its interacting partner(s) (10Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E97-E98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we sought to identify proteins that bind to fidgetin through a yeast two-hybrid screen. We describe here that AKAP95 specifically interacts with fidgetin in yeast and mammalian cells. AKAP95 (mouse gene symbol Akap8, A kinase anchor protein 8) is a nuclear protein (11Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that co-localizes with fidgetin in the nuclear matrix. Furthermore, AKAP95 shows a broad expression pattern overlapping with that of fidgetin during mouse embryogenesis. Finally, although the Akap95 mutation does not lead to obvious abnormality, deficiency in fidgetin and AKAP95 predisposes mouse embryos to cleft palate, thus establishing one aspect of their functional interaction in vivo. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A region in fidgetin (residue 204-372) was fused in-frame with LexA DNA binding domain as a bait in the plasmid pEG202-NLS (OriGene, Rockville, MD). A mouse embryonic day 11.5 cDNA library was cloned into pYESTrp2 vector (Invitrogen). Approximately 8 million transformants were screened on a nutritionally selective medium deficient in Ura, His, Leu, and Trp. Autoactivation tests and specificity tests were performed according to manufacturer's recommendation (OriGene). Plasmid Constructions—The expression vectors pCMV-HA, pCMV-EGFP, and pCMV-FLAG were used to drive the expression of all fusion proteins (9Yang Y. Mahaffey C.L. Berube N. Nystuen A. Frankel W.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For the plasmid encoding AKAP95-FLAG, the Akap95 cDNA was first generated through PCR. Then both the PCR product and the vector were digested with ClaI and XhoI and subsequently ligated so that the Akap95 open reading frame was inserted in-frame 5′ to the FLAG tag. Other plasmids were constructed analogously and sequenced to be correct. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Isolation of Nuclear and Cyto-plasmic Proteins—NIH/3T3 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were seeded in 6-well clusters (Corning, Corning, NY) at 1.5 × 105/ml 18 h prior to transfection. 2 μg of DNA (1 μg of each construct) was co-transfected using Lipofectamine Plus (Invitrogen). Cells were collected for immunoprecipitation or immunostaining 24 h afterward. Differential isolation of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins was achieved through the NE-PER extraction kit (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 15 min on ice and permeabilized for 15 min with ice-cold 4% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline. Fixed cells were incubated with anti-AKAP95 rabbit polyclonal antibody for 1 h at room temperature (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, 1:333) followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h with Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen 1:500). After several washes, coverslips were directly mounted on the glass slides with phosphate-buffered saline containing 90% glycerol, 4% n-propyl gallate, and 1.5 μg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Slides were examined under a Nikon fluorescence microscope (Eclipse E600) using a ×20 objective. Immunoprecipitation—Approximately equal numbers of transfected cells were lysed in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 4 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP and 5% glycerol) with 1× complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and subsequently centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The lysates were precleared by protein A/G plus agarose beads (1:25, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. Then immunoprecipitation was carried out with fresh protein A/G plus agarose beads (1:25) and anti-HA (1:500, Covance Research Products, Berkeley, CA) or anti-FLAG M2 (1:500, Sigma) antibodies, respectively, for 3 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times in cold lysis buffer without the protease inhibitors and washed once with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The proteins were released from the agarose beads by boiling in protein gel loading buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 25% glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) bromphenol blue and 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) and then loaded on SDS-PAGE gels. Western Blot—Protein extracts were resolved by SDS/10% PAGE Ready gel (Bio-Rad), transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), probed with the primary antibody and a secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibody, and visualized with the ECL Plus kit (Amersham Biosciences). The BenchMark prestained protein ladder from Invitrogen was used as a reference for molecular mass estimation. Where indicated, the nitrocellulose membrane was incubated with Restore Western blot stripping buffer (Pierce) at 37 °C for 30 min to remove all the antibodies. The membrane was washed and subsequently reprobed with a different set of antibodies. Cell extracts were made from mouse E11.5 whole embryos. Embryos were homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) with 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and subsequently centrifuged at 7,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C until use. The primary antibodies and the dilutions were: anti-β-galactosidase polyclonal antibody (1:80, Clontech), anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, Covance Research Products), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody and anti-β-tubulin monoclonal antibody (both 1:1,000, Sigma), and anti-AKAP95 antibody (1:666, Upstate Biotechnology). The secondary antibodies and the dilutions were: horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (1:12,000, Invitrogen) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (1:2,000, Amersham Biosciences). ES Cells and Mice—A feeder-independent ES cell line (XG068) derived from the 129/Ola mice was obtained from BayGenomics (San Francisco, CA). Microinjection of the ES cells into blastocysts was carried out by The Jackson Laboratory Microinjection Services. Chimeras were initially crossed to C57BL/6J mice to test germ line transmission based on coat color. F1 progeny carrying the gene trap allele were back-crossed to 129S1/SvImJ for three generations before analysis. All animal procedures followed American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care guidelines and were approved by institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Genotyping—The genotypes of all mice were confirmed by PCR. Mouse tail DNA was amplified 35 cycles (15 s, 95 °C; 30 s, 57 °C; 90 s, 72 °C). The reaction condition for the fidget allele has been described (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To follow the Akap95 gene trap allele, three primers were used in the genotyping PCR reaction: 95U1 (part of the eighth exon of Akap95), 5′-CAGCCTGAGTGGCAAGGCCTTAG-3′; 95D2 (part of the eighth intron of Akap95, 3′ to the gene trap insertion site), 5′-AAATGGGAAGAGACCGACTGGTC-3′; and TRAPD (about 650 nucleotides 3′ to the En2 splice acceptor site in the gene trap construct), 5′-GTTATCGATCTGCGATCTGCG-3′. 95U1 and 95D2 generated a 607-nucleotide product from wild-type allele, whereas 95U1 and TRAPD amplified an ∼1.1-kb fragment from the Akap95 mutation due to the gene trap insertion. β-Galactosidase Histochemistry—Dissected embryos from timed matings were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in wash buffer (0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.3), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% Nonidet P-40), and incubated at 37 °C overnight in a stain solution containing Bluo-Gal (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen), potassium ferricyanide (5 mm), and potassium ferrocyanide (5 mm) in wash buffer. A blue precipitate was seen in embryos carrying the gene-trapped allele, whereas no staining was seen in non-carriers. Embryos were transversely embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned (6 μm), and counterstained with Neutral Fast Red. Sections were imaged on a Nikon eclipse microscope using a Spot RT camera. Real-time PCR—RNA was prepared from E11.5 embryos with TRIzol (Invitrogen). Following DNase I digestion, 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase. The cDNA was diluted 5-fold, and 1 μl was added to Sybr Green PCR mix (Eurogentec, San Diego, CA) with the following primers: actinF, 5′-CATTGCTGACAGGATGCAGAA-3′; actinR, 5′-GCCACCGATCCACACAGAGT-3′; HA95F1, 5′-TGATGGAGCAGTCCAAGAAG-3′; HA95R1, 5′-GGATTCTCGCCCTTCAGATA-3′; and HA95F2, 5′-CATGAAGCAGATGAGGCGTA-3′; HA95R2, 5′-TAGCTTTGCTGTCTGGCTCA-3′. The PCR amplifications were monitored by an ABI Prism 7000 sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The PCR reactions were run in triplicate with two separate runs. The cDNA was made from three mutants and three sex-matched wild-type littermates. The correct PCR amplification was confirmed by the dissociation curve function of the ABI machine and by agarose gel electrophoresis. Skeletal Analysis—Dissected upper jaws of newborn mice were fixed in ethanol for 3 days. The samples were then placed in acetone for 1 day. Skeletons were stained by Alcian blue/Alizarin red for 3 days (12Martin J.F. Bradley A. Olson E.N. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1237-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The samples were cleared by 1% KOH and a glycerol gradient. Fidgetin Interacts with AKAP95 in Yeast—A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify fidgetin-interacting proteins. One particular N-terminal region that did not show significant autoactivation (residues 204-372) was used as a bait against a library of mouse E11.5 cDNAs because of the strong expression of fidgetin at this stage of embryogenesis (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). One of the cDNA clones recovered from the screen contained the majority of the Akap95 open reading frame. AKAP95 did not interact with several control baits (pEG202-Max, pBait, pEG202-NLS, and pRHFM1), indicating the specificity of the fidgetin-AKAP95 binding in yeast. Fidgetin Interacts with AKAP95 in Mammalian Cells—AKAP95 was originally cloned as a nuclear anchoring protein for the regulatory subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (RII/PKAII) (13Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). AKAP95 has also been shown to be involved in mitotic chromosome condensation (14Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 15Steen R.L. Cubizolles F. Le Guellec K. Collas P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 531-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). AKAP95 was localized to the nucleus in interphase and was excluded from nucleoli, indicating a nuclear matrix distribution (11Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 13Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, fidgetin was shown to have a similar intracellular localization (9Yang Y. Mahaffey C.L. Berube N. Nystuen A. Frankel W.N. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 304: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), prompting us to examine the potential overlapping nuclear distribution between fidgetin and AKAP95. Detection of the endogenous fidgetin was not possible due to the inability to develop a specific antibody despite eight attempts. We therefore expressed epitope-tagged fidgetin in cell lines through transfection. Green fluorescent protein-tagged fidgetin co-localized with endogenous AKAP95 in the nuclear matrix of NIH-3T3 cells (Fig. 1). To further evaluate the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction in mammalian cells, we carried out reciprocal immunoprecipitation using cell extracts containing epitope-tagged fidgetin and AKAP95. FLAG-tagged AKAP95 was co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged fidgetin by anti-HA antibodies, indicating the formation of fidgetin-AKAP95 complex (Fig. 2). Conversely, HA-tagged fidgetin was precipitated by anti-FLAG antibodies only when FLAG-tagged AKAP95 was present (Fig. 2). We used deletion constructs to determine the fidgetin region responsible for AKAP95 binding. Full-length fidgetin was split into two parts (at residues 372-373) with an approximately equal number of amino acids. Surprisingly, both deletion constructs retained the ability to interact with AKAP95, suggesting the presence of multiple potential AKAP95 binding domains in fidgetin (data not shown). We used the same strategy to map the fidgetin interaction domain in AKAP95 (split at residues 376-377). Only removing the C-terminal half of AKAP95 abolished the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction (Fig. 3). Together, these data suggest that AKAP95 interacts with fidgetin through its C terminus in mammalian cells. Disruption of AKAP95 Expression by a Gene Trap in Mice—To evaluate the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction in vivo, we sought to analyze the phenotype of mice deficient in both AKAP95 and fidgetin. We first created AKAP95 mutant mice through an ES cell line in which a gene trap construct inserted into the Akap95 gene (XG068, BayGenomics). The sequence tag associated with the XG068 ES cells matched exons 5-8 of Akap95, suggesting that the insertion was in intron 8 (Fig. 4A). Indeed, an intron 8 primer and a pGT1Lxf vector primer amplified an ∼1.1-kb band from the ES cell DNA, confirming the presence of the gene trap vector in intron 8 (Fig. 4B). Hereafter, we use Akap95GT to denote this mutation in which β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion replaces the C-terminal 334 amino acids of AKAP95. The truncation generated from the Akap95GT allele would remove the functional domains responsible for PKA regulatory subunit binding (13Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DNA condensation and chromosome binding (14Collas P. Le Guellec K. Tasken K. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 1167-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Importantly, the AKAP95 truncation would also delete the domain responsible for fidgetin binding (Fig. 3). Akap95GT homozygotes are viable and show no overt phenotype on a mixed 129;B6 strain background. To confirm that the expression of AKAP95 protein was disrupted in Akap95GT mice, we probed cell extracts made from E11.5 embryos using an AKAP95 antibody (13Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7658-7665Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because the insertion was in the eighth intron, a fusion protein containing the first 354 amino acids of AKAP95 and β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion would be made from the trapped allele. The polyclonal AKAP95 antibody was generated by a rat AKAP95 fragment corresponding to amino acid residues 377-687 of mouse AKAP95; therefore, the epitopes would be missing in Akap95GT homozygotes. As predicted, robust signal was present in both wild-type and heterozygous embryo extracts but absent in homozygous samples (Fig. 5). We determined that there was ∼50% reduction in AKAP95 abundance at this embryonic stage in heterozygotes (heterozygote/wild type = 0.51, n = 5, S.D. = 0.21). Examination of AKAP95 and HA95 in Gene Trap Mice—Since AKAP95 has been implicated in many important biological processes, it is surprising that Akap95GT homozygotes do not have overt abnormalities. We performed two sets of control experiments to examine the expression of AKAP95 and HA95 (homologous to AKAP95), a molecule with 61% homology to AKAP95. The gene trap inserted into the eighth intron; therefore, the first 354 amino acids of AKAP95 would still be present in the Akap95GT mice. Several reports indicated that through its N terminus, AKAP95 interacts with other proteins including minichromosome maintenance 2 protein (MCM2) (16Eide T. Tasken K.A. Carlson C. Williams G. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Collas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26750-26756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and p68 RNA helicase (p68) (11Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To examine the expression of the AKAP95-β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein, we probed the nuclear and cytoplasmic cell extracts from E11.5 Akap95GT heterozygous embryos with anti-β-galactosidase antibodies and anti-AKAP95 antibodies. Although AKAP95 is localized to the nuclear fraction, the fusion protein is primarily cytoplasmic (Fig. 6). We note that there are multiple predicted nuclear localization signals (NLS) in AKAP95, and most are still present in the fusion protein. Therefore, it appears that the fusion tag (β-galactosidase-neomycin) with a predicted molecular mass of >120 kDa contributed to the cytoplasmic distribution of the chimeric protein, thus anchoring the N terminus of AKAP95 away from the nucleus, where it is thought to function. HA95 is a nuclear protein with 61% homology to AKAP95 (17Orstavik S. Eide T. Collas P. Han I.O. Tasken K. Kieff E. Jahnsen T. Skalhegg B.S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although HA95 and AKAP95 were reported to have distinct cellular functions (17Orstavik S. Eide T. Collas P. Han I.O. Tasken K. Kieff E. Jahnsen T. Skalhegg B.S. Biol. Cell. 2000; 92: 27-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 18Martins S.B. Eide T. Steen R.L. Jahnsen T. Skalhegg B.S. Collas P. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3703-3713Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the gene encoding HA95 is immediately distal to the Akap95 gene on mouse chromosome 17. We examined whether the AKAP95 gene trap insertion interfered with the expression of HA95, but no differences were observed (Table 1).TABLE 1Expression analysis of HA95 through real-time reverse transcription-PCRHA95 primer pair 1HA95 primer pair 2ΔΔCTS.D.% of controlΔΔCTS.D.% of control95gt/95gt0.070.14395.26−0.0820.078105.7 Open table in a new tab Akap95 Is Expressed Widely during Mouse Mid-gestation—We used the β-galactosidase fusion tag embedded in the gene trap construct to characterize gene expression in embryos. Previously, strong fidgetin expression was observed from mid-to-late gestation in key sites consistently affected in fidget mice, namely the otocyst, optic cup, and pelvic anlage (4Cox G.A. Mahaffey C.L. Nystuen A. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Nat. Genet. 2000; 26: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Akap95 showed a strong expression throughout the entire E11.5 embryos (Fig. 7A). In particular, Akap95 expression in the branchial arches (Fig. 7B), retinal neural epithelium, and otocyst (data not shown) overlapped with that of fidgetin. Defects in AKAP95 and Fidgetin Predispose Mice to Cleft Palates—We backcrossed Akap95GT heterozygotes to 129S1/SvImJ congenic fidget mice and then intercrossed the progeny to generate mice homozygous for both Akap95 and fidget mutations. Only three of the 258 mice analyzed at weaning were double homozygotes (32 expected). The surviving double mutants were small with the eye defects and circling behavior reminiscent of fidget mice. Further studies revealed that at E11.5 and E18.5, Mendelian ratios of homozygotes were observed (data not shown). Double mutants were indeed born alive but failed to thrive. There appeared to be two waves of loss in double mutants. The first wave was right after birth with nearly half of the mice surviving only a few hours. The remaining were always smaller than their littermates, did not nurse well, and succumbed to death gradually before wean. Some newborn double homozygotes were gasping, retaining a blue skin color before death. We analyzed 172 newborn mice from various crosses and found that 50% of double mutants showed a cleft palate phenotype (Table 2), consistent with the overlapping expression of AKAP95 and fidgetin in branchial arches during mouse embryogenesis. It is interesting to note that ∼20% of the animals with fidget mutation alone on the same mixed 129;B6 background had cleft palate, whereas removing one copy of Akap95 did not seem to change the cleft palate rate. The cleft palate phenotype has not been observed in fidget mice maintained on B6 background, indicating that the presence of 129 alleles is required. The palate defect in the double mutant was complete cleft of the secondary palate (Fig. 8), the same phenotype observed in fidget animals with cleft palate on the mixed 129;B6 background (data not shown). Taken together, our results suggest that removing the C terminus of AKAP95, thus abolishing the AKAP95-fidgetin interaction, significantly exaggerated the cleft palate phenotype caused by fidgetin deficiency (Table 2, p = 0.004, Fisher's exact test).TABLE 2Increased incidence of cleft palate in double mutant miceGenotypeNo. of mice analyzedNo. of cleft palatePercentage of cleft palate95gt/95gt, fi/fi34175095gt/+, fi/fi31619.4+/+, fi/fi37718.995gt/95gt, fi/+501295gt/95gt, +/+2000 Open table in a new tab Fidgetin is a member of subfamily-7 of AAA proteins that does not seem to have a set of unifying functions (7Frickey T. Lupas A.N. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 2-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). AAA proteins are ATP-dependent molecular chaperones that function through protein-protein interactions. It has been proposed that the function of a given AAA protein is defined in part by its binding partner and in part by the subcellular localization of the interaction (10Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E97-E98Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Through a yeast two-hybrid screen, we identified a fidgetin-interacting protein, AKAP95. In vitro studies confirmed that AKAP95 specifically interacted with fidgetin through its carboxyl-half. During mouse embryogenesis, AKAP95 expression spatially and temporally overlapped with that of fidgetin. We observed low penetrance cleft palate in fidget mice maintained on a mixed 129;B6 background, adding a new facet to the pleiotropic fidget phenotypes. Consistent with the strong expression of both molecules in the maxillary component of the branchial arches, deficiency in AKAP95 and fidgetin significantly increased (more than 2-fold) the incidence of cleft palate in the double mutants, establishing a non-redundant role for the AKAP95-fidgetin interaction in vivo. AKAP95 binds to many proteins such as the regulatory subunit of type II cAMP-dependent protein kinase (13Coghlan V.M. Langeberg L.K. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J. Scott J.D. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2004; 173: 4806-4814Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Thus AKAP95 has been proposed to be involved in a variety of cellular functions including PKA signaling, DNA condensation, transcription, and DNA replication (22Langeberg L.K. Scott J.D. J. Cell Sci. 2005; 118: 3217-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Recent reports indicate that AKAP95 is also involved in cAMP-regulated mRNA stability (23Jungmann R.A. Kiryukhina O. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 25170-25177Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and the nuclear translocation of active caspase 3 (24Kamada S. Kikkawa U. Tsujimoto Y. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 9469-9477Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Despite numerous attempts, no in vivo role has been established for AKAP95 yet. We now show that replacing the C-terminal 334 residues of AKAP95 with a β-galactosidase-neomycin fusion protein does not cause overt abnormalities in mice. It is important to note that the C terminus of AKAP95 replaced by the fusion tag from the Akap95GT allele includes functional domains responsible for PKA regulatory subunit binding, DNA condensation, chromosome binding, and caspase 3 binding. More importantly for our study, the AKAP95 truncation would prevent itself from binding to fidgetin (Fig. 3). Still, the remaining N terminus of AKAP95 possesses putative NLSs and the potential to interact with nuclear proteins such as MCM2 (16Eide T. Tasken K.A. Carlson C. Williams G. Jahnsen T. Tasken K. Collas P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26750-26756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and p68 (11Akileswaran L. Taraska J.W. Sayer J.A. Gettemy J.M. Coghlan V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17448-17454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we also show that the fusion protein is pre-dominantly cytoplasmic, where the N terminus of AKAP95 may not carry out its normal nuclear function, indicating that the Akap95 gene trap allele abolishes most if not all proposed functions of AKAP95 in the mouse. We also found no evidence for compensation at the expression level by the related gene HA95, suggesting that AKAP95 is functionally redundant, at least in laboratory mice on a mixed 129;B6 background. However, when both AKAP95 and fidgetin are deficient, the double mutants show elevated incidence of cleft palate, suggesting that the specific AKAP95-fidgetin binding could not be compensated by other mechanisms. Although the fusion protein between the N-terminal AKAP95 and β-galactosidase-Neo generated by the Akap95GT allele has the potential to cause phenotype(s) through a dominant-negative fashion, multiple lines of evidence suggest that the cleft palate phenotype was not due to the fusion protein. First, mice carrying either one or two copies of Akap95GT did not show overt phenotypes. Second, we did not observe significant difference in cleft palate incidence between fidget mice with one copy of the Akap95GT and fidget mice with wild-type Akap95 (95GT/+, fi/fi, 6/31, and +/+, fi/fi, 7/37). Third, gene trap homozygotes did not show elevated incidence of cleft palate (95GT/95GT, fi/+, 1/50 and 95GT/95GT, +/+, 0/20). Together, these observations point to a critical role for the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction in mouse palatogenesis. What is the disease mechanism leading to cleft palate in the double mutants? Most mouse mutations with developmental phenotypes are caused by defects in signaling pathways involved in embryogenesis. As a result, mutations (either spontaneous or targeted) are frequently found in upstream signaling molecules including morphogen and morphogen receptor or in downstream transcription factors. In this regard, both fidgetin and AKAP95 are exceptions in that they are molecular chaperones/scaffolding proteins. Recently, a new trend is emerging in which mutations associated with developmental defects were found in regulatory molecules other than the actual components of the pathway (25Eggenschwiler J.T. Espinoza E. Anderson K.V. Nature. 2001; 412: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar, 26Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). For example, mutations in intraflagellar transport proteins can cause defects in Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling in mouse embryonic development through cilia formation, intracellular transport, or a combination of both mechanisms (26Huangfu D. Liu A. Rakeman A.S. Murcia N.S. Niswander L. Anderson K.V. Nature. 2003; 426: 83-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). Based on the cleft palate phenotype, we speculate that the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction may modulate signaling pathway(s) underlining palatogenesis in mice, with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) being a likely candidate. To direct and amplify the cAMP signaling, the regulatory subunits of PKA and thus the holoenzyme are targeted and compartmentalized to discrete subcellular locations by AKAPs (27Michel J.J. Scott J.D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2002; 42: 235-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). PKA is a negative regulator of Shh signaling (28Epstein D.J. Marti E. Scott M.P. McMahon A.P. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2885-2894Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Hammerschmidt M. Bitgood M.J. McMahon A.P.

Cell. 2000; 100: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), and germ line removal of GLI2, a Shh target, also resulted in a high incidence of cleft palate in mice (31Mo R. Freer A.M. Zinyk D.L. Crackower M.A. Michaud J. Heng H.H. Chik K.W. Shi X.M. Tsui L.C. Cheng S.H. Joyner A.L. Hui C. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 113-123Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that some of the phenotypes in fidget mice such as small eyes and absent semicircular canals are also found in mice deficient in Shh (32Riccomagno M.M. Martinu L. Mulheisen M. Wu D.K. Epstein D.J. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2365-2378Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) and GLI3, another Shh target (33Hui C.C. Joyner A.L. Nat. Genet. 1993; 3: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar), suggesting that Shh signaling may be involved in the defects demonstrated by fidget and fidgetin-AKAP95 double mutants. In humans, cleft lip and/or palate is a common birth defect with both genetic and environmental contributions. Despite intensive efforts, the major genes responsible for cleft lip and/or palate still remain elusive. The best fit genetic model has been predicted to be an oligogenic one in which a few major susceptibility genes interact with a small number of modifier genes (34Stanier P. Moore G.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: R73-R81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nine human chromosome regions have been implicated in cleft lip and/or palate to date (35Prescott N.J. Winter R.M. Malcolm S. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2001; 65: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In humans, the FIDGETIN gene is on 2q24, and the AKAP95 gene is on 19p13, and both chromosomes contain critical regions for cleft lip and/or palate (35Prescott N.J. Winter R.M. Malcolm S. Ann. Hum. Genet. 2001; 65: 505-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although the FIGN and AKAP95 genes are >30 mb from the leading candidate genes in the respective critical region, further investigation of the fidgetin-AKAP95 interaction may nevertheless provide a better understanding of human cleft palate pathogenesis.

However, whether and how PDK1 activity is regulated in cells remains largely uncharacterized. In the present study, we show that PDK1 undergoes insulin-stimulated and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation at Ser244 in the activation loop and at a novel site: Ser163 in the hinge region between the two lobes of the kinase domain. Sequence alignment studies revealed that the residue corresponding to Ser163 of PDK1 in all other AGC kinases is glutamate, suggesting that a negative charge at this site may be important for PDK1 function. Replacing Ser163 with a negatively charged residue, glutamate, led to a 2-fold increase in PDK1 activity. Molecular modeling studies suggested that phosphorylated Ser163 may form additional hydrogen bonds with Tyr149 and Gln223. In support of this, mutation of Tyr149 to Ala is sufficient to reduce PDK1 activity. Taken together, our results suggest that PDK1 phosphorylation of Ser163 may provide a mechanism to fine-tune PDK1 activity and function in cells. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) mediates phosphorylation and activation of members of the AGC protein kinase family and plays an essential role in insulin signaling and action.

PDK1 phosphorylates many important kinases such as Akt/PKB, p70 S6 kinase, and protein kinase C isoforms in their respective activation loops and plays an important role in insulin-mediated biological events in cells (1Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 2Wick K.L. Liu F. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2001; 1: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined whether and how PDK1 activity is regulated in cells. Unlike its substrates such as Akt and p70 S6 kinase, the in vitro kinase activity of PDK1 immunoprecipitated from cells is not significantly affected by prior treatment of the cells with either growth factors or pharmacological inhibitors of PI 3-kinase (3Alessi D.R.

However, PDK1 activity has been found to be stimulated by insulin (5Chen H. Nystrom F.H. Dong L.Q. Li Y. Song S. Liu F. Quon M.J.

The molecular mechanisms that regulate PDK1 activity in cells remain unknown. Multiple phosphorylation sites have been identified in human PDK1, including Ser241 in the activation loop (Ser244 for mouse PDK1) (8Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J.

J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). While phosphorylation in the activation loop has been shown to be essential for PDK1 activity, it remains to be determined whether phosphorylation at this site is regulated in cells. In addition to Ser244, PDK1 undergoes growth factor-stimulated phosphorylation at additional site(s) (10Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential mechanism for regulating PDK1 activity. In the present study, we show that phosphorylation of endogenous mouse PDK1 at Ser244 is stimulated by insulin. In addition, we identified Ser163 in the catalytic domain of mouse PDK1 as a novel insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site. Together these data suggest that PDK1 activity can be stimulated in cells and phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation. Plasmids—cDNAs encoding hemagglutinin- or Myc-tagged PDK1 were described previously (11Wick M.J. Dong L.Q. Riojas R.A. Ramos F. Liu F. J. Biol.

PDK1 mutants were generated by single-stranded site-directed mutagenesis using the Kunkel method (12Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

These cells were maintained in 1:1 Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. All cell culture experiments were conducted at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Transfection, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot—Transfections were normally performed in 100- or 60-mm plates with 10 or 5 μg of recombinant plasmid per plate, respectively, using Lipofectamine or LipofectAmine2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were serum-starved and treated with or without insulin as indicated in the figure legends. Cells were then lysed in buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μm microcystin-LR, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Homogenates were centrifuged (10,000 × g, 4 °C, 10 min), and supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation or Western analysis, using similar procedures as described previously (11Wick M.J.

Antibodies to phospho-PDK1S241, phospho-AktT308, phospho-ERK1/2, and ERK1/2 were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Danvers, MA). Antibody to Akt was from BIOSOURCE (Camarillo, CA). Anti-PDK1 antibody was described previously (4Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In Vitro Kinase Assay—PDK1 in vitro activity assay was performed as described previously, using a synthetic peptide derived from the activation loop of Akt (KTFCGTPEYLAPEVRR) as a substrate (4Dong L.Q.

PDK1 kinase activity was normalized to PDK1 protein levels determined by Western blotting using the LI-COR Odyssey system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). In Vivo Labeling and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Radiolabeling of cells with [32P]orthophosphate and phosphoamino acid analysis were performed as reported previously (10Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Molecular Modeling—Various structures described in the text were obtained using their Protein Data Bank codes from the Protein Data Bank. Structural modulations were performed using Swiss-PDB viewer program (15Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9586) Google Scholar) and were refined using Pymol (DeLano Scientific, San Carlos, CA). Insulin Stimulates Autophosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser244— We previously found that insulin had no significant effect on PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser244 when the kinase is overexpressed in cells (10Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the increased basal Ser244 phosphorylation was caused by overexpression, we studied endogenous PDK1 phosphorylation in mouse hypothalamic GT1–7 cells. As shown in Fig. 1, treating GT1–7 cells with 10 nm insulin is sufficient to induce significant phosphorylation of endogenous Akt (Fig. 1A) and MAPK (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that GT1–7 cells are insulin responsive and are an excellent cell system to study the effect of insulin on endogenous PDK1. We examined insulin-stimulated PDK1 phosphorylation in GT1–7 cells by Western blot using a phospho-specific antibody to Ser241 of human PDK1 (Ser244 of mouse PDK1). We found that insulin greatly stimulated mouse PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser244 in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). The insulin-stimulated PDK1S244 phosphorylation was inhibited by two PI 3-kinase-selective inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin (Fig. 2B and C). Insulin-stimulated PDK1S244 phosphorylation was also observed in other cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and C2C12 cells, albeit at higher doses of insulin treatment (data not shown). Since phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser244 is essential for its activity, these data provide evidence that the activity of endogenous PDK1 in intact cells can be stimulated. However, we found that in certain cell lines such as HEK293 cells, insulin has no significant effect on endogenous PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser244 (data not shown), suggesting that the stimulatory effect of insulin on PDK1 phosphorylation may be cell type-specific. Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation of PDK1 at a Site Other than Ser244—We attempted to determine whether insulin stimulates PDK1 phosphorylation at a site(s) in addition to Ser244. To this end, we generated a double mutant of PDK1 in which Lys114 in the ATP-binding site is replaced with Gly and Ser244 in the activation loop is replaced with Ala (PDK1K114G/S244A). In vivo labeling of mouse hepatocytes showed that insulin-stimulated PDK1K114G/S244A phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). Unlike phosphorylation of wild-type PDK1 at Ser244 in GT1–7 cells, the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the PDK1K114G/S244A double mutant was not evident until 10 min. However, the insulin-stimulated PDK1K114G/S244A phosphorylation was also inhibited by pretreatment of cells with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (Fig. 3, B and C). Phosphoamino acid analyses revealed that the insulin-simulated PDK1K114G/S244A phosphorylation occurred exclusively on serine residues (Fig. 3D). Since PDK1K114G/S244A is kinase-inactive, these results suggest that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1 is mediated by a heterologous kinase. Identification of Ser163 as the Novel Insulin-stimulated Phosphorylation Site—Based on the finding that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1K114G/S244A is inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 3B), we hypothesized that a kinase downstream of PI 3-kinase, such as an AGC kinase, may play a role in phosphorylating PDK1. AGC kinases prefer substrates with a consensus phosphorylation sequence RXRXXS/T, where R is either Arg or Lys, X is any amino acid, and S/T is the potential phosphorylation site (16Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 17Obata T. Yaffe M.B. Leparc G.G. Piro E.T. Maegawa H. Kashiwagi A. Kikkawa R. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36108-36115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). A sequence analysis suggested that there are several potential AGC kinase phosphorylation sites in mouse PDK1, including Ser50, Ser95, and Ser163. To test whether any of these sites is phosphorylated in cells in response to insulin stimulation, triple mutants of PDK1, including PDK1K114G/S244A/S50A, PDK1K114G/S244A/S95A, PDK1K114G/S244A/S163D, were generated. In vivo labeling of hepatocytes revealed that mutations at Ser50 or Ser95 had no effect on insulin-stimulated PDK1 phosphorylation. On the other hand, replacing Ser163 with Asp greatly reduced insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1 (Fig. 4A). To provide further evidence that Ser163 of PDK1 is phosphorylated in cells, we replaced Ser163 with Thr (PDK1S163T). In vivo labeling and phosphoamino acid analyses revealed a small but notable threonine phosphorylation of the PDK1S163T mutant but not the wild-type PDK1 (Fig. 4B). These findings suggest that Ser163, which is conserved between mouse, human, and Drosophila PDK1 (Fig. 4C), is a potential insulin-stimulated phosphorylation site. Interestingly, all other AGC kinases have a glutamic acid residue at the site corresponding to Ser163 of mouse PDK1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that a negative charge at this site may be important for PDK1 function. Replacing Ser163 with a Negatively Charged Amino Acid Residue Increases PDK1 Activity—To investigate the potential role of PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser163, mutants of PDK1 were generated in which the residue was changed to either glutamic acid (S163E) to mimic phosphorylation or to alanine (S163A) to disrupt phosphorylation. Wild-type (PDK1WT), PDK1S163E, or PDK1S163A were expressed in CHO-IR cells, purified by immunoprecipitation, and analyzed by in vitro kinase assays using an Akt peptide as a substrate. PDK1S163E, but not PDK1S163A, displayed a 2-fold increase in kinase activity compared with PDK1WT (Fig. 5A). However, replacing Ser163 with alanine had no significant effect on PDK1 kinase activity, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may play a role in fine tuning but not indispensable for PDK1 activity. We also examined whether mutation at Ser163 affects PDK1 activity in intact cells. Significantly more insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation was observed in cells overexpressing PDK1S163E compared with cells expressing PDK1WT or the PDK1S163A mutant (Fig. 5, B and C). Consistent with the finding that replacing Ser163 with alanine had no significant effect on PDK1 activity in vitro (Fig. 5A), overexpression of the PDK1S163A mutant did not suppress insulin-stimulated Akt phosphorylation in intact cells (Fig. 5, B and C), suggesting that this mutant does not function as a dominant negative in cells. Structural Modeling of PDK1S163E—To gain insight into how mutation of PDK1S163E may function to increase PDK1 activity, we employed molecular modeling using the crystal structure of PDK1WT (Protein Data Bank ID: 1H1W (18Biondi R.M. Komander D. Thomas C.C. Lizcano J.M. Deak M. Alessi D.R. van Aalten D.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4219-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar)). In the PDK1WT structure, Ser163 (human PDK1 Ser160) is located on the β5-strand in the hinge region of the kinase domain. The backbone oxygen of Ser163 forms a hydrogen bond with the ATP molecule. Interestingly, we noticed a sulfate ion occupying electron density in proximity to Ser163, and the sulfate ion appears to form hydrogen bonds with the adjacent residues Tyr149 and Gln223 (hPDK1 Tyr146 and Gln220) (Fig. 6A). Following Ser163 to Glu mutation and energy minimization, the Glu side chain occupied the position equivalent to the sulfate ion and formed hydrogen bond contacts with Tyr149 and Gln223 (Fig. 6B). This model suggests that phosphorylation of Ser163 may stabilize the active conformation by contacting Tyr149 and Gln223. To test this, we mutated either Tyr149 or Gln223 to Ala and analyzed PDK1 kinase activity in vitro. Replacing either Tyr149 or Gln223 to Ala led to reduced PDK1 autophosphorylation in vitro (data not shown). In addition, a double mutation of Tyr149 to Ala and Ser163 to Glu (PDK1Y149A/S163E) was tested for its ability to phosphorylate Akt in hepatocytes. Compared with PDK1S163E, PDK1Y149A/S163E reduced the activity of PDK1 on Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 6, C and D), suggesting that the hydrogen bond contact between Glu163 and Tyr149 may be required for the increase in PDK1 activity. PDK1 is well characterized as a master kinase that activates multiple AGC kinases, yet how the kinase itself is regulated remains largely unknown. In the present study, we show that insulin stimulated autophosphorylation of endogenous PDK1 at Ser244 in GT1–7 cells (Fig. 2) as well as other cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and C2C12 cells, although at higher doses (data not show). While these results suggest that PDK1 activity may be stimulated in cells, it has previously been reported that in vitro kinase activity of PDK1 is not sensitive to insulin treatment (4Dong L.Q. Zhang L.-B. Langlais P. He H. Clark M. Zhu L. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8117-8122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 9Casamayor A. Morrice N.A. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that PDK1 undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation in vitro, which leads to auto-activation of the kinase during the in vitro kinase assay processes. Consistent with this idea, it has been shown that insulin stimulates endogenous PDK1 activity in mouse retina (19Kondo T. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 37997-38006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and human skeletal muscle (6Kim Y.-B. Kotani K. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 2003; 52: 1935-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In addition to Ser244, we found that insulin stimulated PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser163. Our results suggest that a heterologous kinase is involved in insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1 at Ser163. However, the identity of this kinase is currently unknown. Phosphoamino acid analysis studies revealed that insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1K114G/S244A occurred primarily on serine residues (Fig. 3D), suggesting that a Ser/Thr kinase is involved in the phosphorylation. The sequence surrounding Ser163 is similar to the hydrophobic motifs of p70 S6 kinase and Akt (20Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar), which are phosphorylated by mTOR (21Sarbassov D.D. Guertin D.A. Ali S.M. Sabatini D.M. Science. 2005; 307: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (5257) Google Scholar, 22Brown E.J. Beal P.A. Keith C.T. Chen J. Shin T.B. Schreiber S.L. Nature. 1995; 377: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Thus, one potential PDK1 Ser163 kinase is mTOR, which is activated by insulin and inhibited by PI 3-kinase inhibitors (23Brunn G.J. Williams J. Sabers C. Wiederrecht G. Lawrence J.C.J. Abraham R.T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5265-5267Crossref Scopus (626) Google Scholar). However, we found that overexpression of mTOR did not significantly stimulate PDK1 phosphorylation (data not shown). Further studies are needed to characterize the serine kinase(s) that mediates insulin-stimulated PDK1 phosphorylation at Ser163. To determine whether Ser163 is phosphorylated in cells, we replaced this residue with threonine and carried out in vivo labeling and phosphoamino acid analysis. Using a similar approach, we previously identified Ser244 as a trans-autophosphorylation site (10Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We detected a low but notable insulin-stimulated threonine phosphorylation of the PDK1S163T mutant but not wild-type PDK1 (Fig. 4B). The low stoichiometry of PDK1S163T threonine phosphorylation is consistent with our previous findings that Ser244 and Ser399 are major phosphorylation sites (8Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 10Wick M.J. Ramos F.J. Chen H. Quon M.J. Dong L.Q. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 42913-42919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, we cannot exclude the possibilities that Ser163 is a better target than Thr163 for the heterologous kinase or that only a fraction of PDK1 is phosphorylated at this site in cells. Structurally, PDK1S163 lies near the ATP-binding pocket and the equivalent residue in other AGC protein kinases is a negatively charged amino acid residue, glutamate (Fig. 4C). Computer modeling studies of a mutated PDK1 Ser163 to Glu suggest that additional hydrogen bonds are formed with Tyr149 on the β4 strand and Gln223. Gln223 is located in the Mg2+-binding loop and is structurally conserved between most AGC kinases. According to our model, phosphorylation of Ser163 may stabilize the active conformation by forming hydrogen bonds with Tyr149 and Gln223. We found that replacing Ser163 with alanine had no significant effect on PDK1 activity, suggesting that phosphorylation at this site may act to fine-tune PDK1 activity and/or specificity. In addition to insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of PDK1, other mechanisms of regulating PDK1 activity have been proposed. Insulin/IGF-1 treatments stimulate plasma membrane (24Anderson K.E.

In vitro autophosphorylation of PDK1 is increased by deletion of the pleckstrin homology domain (8Wick M.J. Wick K.R. Chen H. He H. Dong L.Q. Quon M.J. Liu F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16632-16638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or by interacting with the hydrophobic motifs of RSK2 or PKCζ (30Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12466-12475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), suggesting that substrate binding may induce allosteric activation of PDK1. More recently, it was found that STRAP (serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein) binds the kinase domain of PDK1 and stimulates its activity in vitro (32Seong H.A. Jung H. Choi H.S. Kim K.T. Ha H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 42897-42908Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that PDK1 activity can be regulated by multiple mechanisms in vivo, which is not surprising since PDK1 plays a key role in the activation of numerous downstream kinases (2Wick K.L. Liu F. Curr. Drug Targets Immune Endocr. Metab. Disord. 2001; 1: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 33Mora A. Komander D. van Aalten D.M. Alessi D.R. Semin Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). In conclusion, our studies suggest that PDK1 activity is regulated at multiple levels and phosphorylation plays an important role in the regulation. In addition to autophosphorylation in the activation loop, PDK1 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation at Ser163 via a heterologous kinase. Phosphorylation of these sites may provide a novel mechanism to fine-tune PDK1 activity. We thank Dr. Domenico Accili for the murine hepatocyte cell line and Dr. P. John Hart and Dr. Alex Taylor for helpful discussions regarding the structural models."

A receptor for Dr adhesins is the cell surface protein, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). We have carried out a functional analysis of Dr adhesins, as well as mutagenesis and crystallographic studies of DaaE, to obtain detailed molecular information about interactions of Dr adhesins with their receptors. The crystal structure of DaaE has been solved at 1.48Å resolution. Trimers of the protein are found in the crystal, as has been the case for other Dr adhesins. Naturally occurring variants and directed mutations in DaaE have been generated and analyzed for their ability to bind DAF. Mapping of the mutation sites onto the DaaE molecular structure shows that several of them contribute to a contiguous surface that is likely the primary DAF-binding site. The DAF-binding properties of purified fimbriae and adhesin proteins from mutants and variants correlated with the ability of bacteria expressing these proteins to bind to human epithelial cells in culture. DaaE, DraE, AfaE-III, and AfaE-V interact with complement control protein (CCP) domains 2-4 of DAF, and analysis of the ionic strength dependence of their binding indicates that the intermolecular interactions are highly electrostatic in nature. The adhesins AfaE-I and NfaE-2 bind to CCP-3 and CCP-4 of DAF, and electrostatic interactions contribute significantly less to these interactions. These observations are consistent with structural predictions for these Dr variants and also suggest a role for the positively charged region linking CCP-2 and CCP-3 of DAF in electrostatic Dr adhesin-DAF interactions.

Bacterial pathogens frequently express adhesins that mediate attachment to the sites of infections. The Dr family of adhesins of Escherichia coli is associated with diarrhea and urinary tract infections, in particular cystitis, pyelonephritis, and recurring infections. This family includes Dr hemagglutinin (DraE), Dr-II, DaaE, AfaE-I, AfaE-II, AfaE-III, AfaE-V, and NfaE-111 and others (1Servin A.L. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2005; 18: 264-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Dr family members such as DraE, DaaE, and Dr-II have been shown to exhibit a fimbrial morphology (2Bilge S.S. Clausen C.R. Lau W. Moseley S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 3Swanson T.N. Bilge S.S. Nowicki B. Moseley S.L. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 261-268Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fimbrial structure consists largely of a single polymerized subunit. The major structural subunit is also the adhesive subunit (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Other members of the Dr family are described as afimbrial based on the fact that fimbriae cannot be detected by electron microscopy (5Le Bouguenec C. Garcia M.I. Ouin V. Desperrier J.M. Gounon P. Labigne A. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 5106-5114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Labigne-Roussel A.F. Lark D. Schoolnik G. Falkow S. Infect. Immun. 1984; 46: 251-259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The fimbriae are assembled via the chaperone/usher pathway, a common assembly mechanism for bacterial appendages (7Sauer F.G. Remaut H. Hultgren S.J. Waksman G. Biochim. Biophys.

The final β-strand in the fold (strand G) is missing in the structural subunits, creating a deep hydrophobic cleft on the surface. The chaperones insert their β-strand into this cleft to complete the Ig-like fold in a process called donor strand complementation. Assembly of fimbriae proceeds by a donor strand exchange mechanism in which the chaperone β-strand is replaced by a conserved β-strand motif located at the N terminus of a second structural subunit.

DAF is a complement-regulatory protein that protects host tissues from damage by the autologous complement system by inhibiting the formation of C3 and C5 convertases and accelerating their decay (11Nicholson-Weller A. Wang C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). DAF is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored membrane protein present on a variety of epithelial surfaces, including gastrointestinal mucosa, exocrine glands, renal pelvis, ureter, bladder, cervix, and uterine mucosa (12Medof M.E. Walter E.I. Rutgers J.L. Knowles D.M. Nussenzweig V. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 848-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The extracellular portion of DAF includes four complement control protein domains (CCPs), alternatively known as short consensus repeats (11Nicholson-Weller A. Wang C.E. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1994; 123: 485-491PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of classical pathway (CP) convertases is localized within CCP-2 and CCP-3, whereas regulation of the alternative pathway (AP) extends through to CCP-4 (13Brodbeck W.G. Liu D. Sperry J. Mold C. Medof M.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2528-2534PubMed Google Scholar). CCP-3 has been identified as the domain involved in binding to the Dr adhesins (14Hasan R.J. Pawelczyk E. Urvil P.T.

CEA-related cell adhesion molecules have been shown to serve as receptors for some Dr adhesins (DraE, DaaE, and AfaE-III) (16Guignot J. Peiffer I. Bernet-Camard M.F. Lublin D.M. Carnoy C.

The structures indicate that the assembly of Dr adhesin fimbriae is analogous to the assembly of the type 1 pilus, the P pilus, and Caf1 antigen. It has been shown that DraE and AfaE-III adhesins can form trimers if they are expressed in the absence of their chaperones (18Pettigrew D. Anderson K.L. Billington J. Cota E. Simpson P. Urvil P.

Previously, amino acids involved in DAF-DraE interactions had been implicated by mutagenesis studies (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol.

DaaE is a fimbrial adhesin (designated F1845 in some studies) and is responsible for diffuse tissue culture cell adherence of E. coli C1845, a strain isolated from a child with protracted diarrhea (2Bilge S.S. Clausen C.R. Lau W. Moseley S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). DaaE shares 57% identity with DraE at the amino acid level. In this study, we present the crystal structure of DaaE together with a mutational analysis of DaaE that together delineate the DAF-binding surface. Homology modeling of Dr adhesins AfaE-V, AfaE-I, and NfaE-2 and binding studies of Dr adhesins DaaE, DraE, AfaE-III, AfaE-V, AfaE-I, and NfaE-2 reveal different mechanisms of DAF recognition by the members of the Dr family. We provide experimental evidence that electrostatic forces play an important role in DaaE, DraE, AfaE-III, and AfaE-V interactions with DAF and that electrostatic steering is a minor contribution to AfaE-I and NfaE-2 binding to DAF. The results of this study provide new insight into DAF-Dr adhesin associations and increase our understanding of the complex mechanisms used by pathogenic E. coli to cause infections.

Microbiol. 1997; 23: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Derivatives of pCC90-D54Stop, pET-21d, and pET-22b (Novagen, San Diego) were grown in 100 μg/ml ampicillin or carbenicillin. E. coli DH5α (Invitrogen), BL21 (DE3) (Novagen), and K12 derivative 191a (21Klemm P. Jorgensen B.J. van Die I. de Ree H. Bergmans H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1985; 199: 410-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) were hosts for the plasmids. Purification of E. coli chromosomal DNA, plasmid isolation, E. coli transformation, restriction enzyme digestion, and ligation were carried out as described (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 98-148Google Scholar). Enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and used as recommended by the manufacturer. Human bladder epithelial cell line T24 (ATCC HTB-4) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell transfectant clones that express human CEA or the vector alone were used (17Berger C.N. Billker O. Meyer T.F. Servin A.L. Kansau I. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 963-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). T24 cells were grown in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. CHO cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml hygromycin B. Cell lines were cultured according to standard tissue culture techniques. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of DaaE Trimers—The mature DaaE amino acid sequence was PCR-amplified using pSSS1 (2Bilge S.S. Clausen C.R. Lau W. Moseley S.L. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4281-4289Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar) as a template. In preparing a construct for the purification and crystallization of DaaE, we attempted to follow the strategy of Anderson et al. (19Anderson K.L. Billington J. Pettigrew D. Cota E. Simpson P. Roversi P. Chen H.O. Urvil P. du Merle L. Barlow P.N. Medof M.E. Smith R.A.G. Nowicki B. Le Bouguénec C. Lea S.M. Matthews S. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 647-657Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) by moving the N-terminal 11 amino acids of the mature protein to the C terminus of the molecule to complete the structure formed by donor strand complementation. However, we found that removal of the N terminus had a deleterious effect on the binding properties of the purified protein (data not shown). We therefore prepared cytoplasmic proteins consisting of the entire sequence of the mature native DaaE or mutants, followed by a four amino acid linker, DNKQ, a repeat of the 11 N-terminal amino acids of the mature protein, and a C-terminal hexahistidine tag. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator method and ABI sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The protein was expressed by pET-21d (Novagen) derivatives in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by metal affinity chromatography followed by size exclusion chromatography on Superdex 75 (Amersham Biosciences). Although this construct provided proteins suitable for crystallization and binding studies, it did not result in self-complemented monomers. To detect DaaE trimer-DAF complex formation, the proteins were mixed in equimolar amounts and analyzed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 column in HBS-E buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA). The column was calibrated using gel filtration markers (Amersham Biosciences). Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Dr Adhesins—The recombinant strains expressing DraE and AfaE-III fimbriae include strains described previously (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and constructs described below. Cystitis-associated E. coli strains expressing AfaE-I and AfaE-V (23Zhang L. Foxman B. Tallman P. Cladera E. Le Bouguénec C. Marrs C.F. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 2011-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), kindly provided by Carl F. Marrs, were utilized to amplify afaE-I and afaE-V. nfaE-2, differing from the published sequence of its closest homolog, nfaE-111, by a frameshift mutation, was amplified from the diarrheal isolate SM128 (GenBank™ accession number:DQ386080). PCR products bearing the coding regions for DaaE, AfaE-I, AfaE-V, and NfaE-2 were cloned to pUC-Cm as described (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Genes encoding Dr adhesins were amplified by using the following primers: for DraE and AfaE-III, DraE-BamHI, GGATCCGAAGGAGATATACATATGAAAAAATTAGCGATCATGGCC, and DraE-PstI, CACGCACGTCCTGCAGTCATTTTGCCCAGTAACC; for AfaE-V, DraE-BamHI primer and AfaE-V-PstI, CACGCACGCTGCAGTCAACTCACCCAGTAGCCCCAGT; for NfaE-2, NfaE-2-BamHI, CGAGGATCCGAAGGAGATATACATATGAAAATAAAATATACGATG, and NfaE-2-PstI, CACGCACGCTGCAGTTATTGGCTGTACACTGCGGC. Products were digested with BamHI and PstI and inserted into BamHI and PstI restriction sites of pUC-Cm. The gene encoding adhesin DaaE was amplified by using the following primers: DaaE-BamHI, GGATCCGAACAGGTAATCAATATGAAAAAATTAGCGATAATG, and DaaE-EcoRI, GAATTCTTAGTTCGTCCAGTAACCCC. Product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI and inserted into BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of pUC-Cm. The gene encoding adhesin AfaE-I was amplified by using the following primers: AfaE-I-EcoR1, GAATTCGAAGGAGATATACATATGAAAAAATTAGCGATCATAG, and AfaE-I-PstI, CACGCACGCTGCAGTTATTTTGTCCAGAACCCGCCTTCG. The product was digested with EcoRI and PstI and inserted into EcoRI and PstI restriction sites of pUC-Cm. The resulting plasmids were transformed into E. coli 191A (pCC90-D54Stop) or DH5α (pCC90-D54Stop). This strain contains genes of the dra operon necessary for fimbrial expression, with a premature stop codon at codon 54 within draE (no full-length DraE can be detected in this strain). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator method and ABI sequencing (PE Applied Biosystems). Dr adhesins were purified from the recombinant strains as described previously (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For SPR analysis, adhesins were purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in HBS-E buffer. DAF234 Expression and Purification—DAF containing CCP-2, -3, and -4 with an oligohistidine tag at the C-terminal end (DAF234) was purified from recombinant Pichia pastoris generously provided by Dr. Susan Lea (Oxford University, Oxford, UK). DAF234 was expressed in P. pastoris and purified from the supernatant of induced cultures by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography as described previously (24Powell R.M. Ward T. Evans D.J. Almond J.W. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 9306-9312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For SPR experiments, the protein was then purified by gel filtration chromatography using a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) in HBS-E buffer. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of DAF34—PCR products with the coding regions of DAF CCP-3 and -4 (amino acids 128-251) (DAF34) were amplified using cDNA clone image ID 3460621 (ATCC) as a template and inserted into pET-22b (Novagen). The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified from inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were dissolved overnight in buffer containing 30 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm dithiothreitol, and 8 m urea. One volume of the protein sample was added slowly to 20 volumes of the buffer containing 50 mm CHES (pH 9.2), 500 mm arginine, 1 mm reduced glutathione, and 1 mm oxidized glutathione; and the sample was left overnight at 4 °C. The refolded protein was concentrated by ultrafiltration and purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Biosciences) in HBS-E buffer. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR measurements were carried out in the running buffer: HBS-EP buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.005% P-20 surfactant (BIAcore AB, Uppsala, Sweden)) using a BIAcore 2000 system (BIAcore AB). To analyze the interaction between DAF and DaaE trimers or DAF and Dr fimbriae, the trimers or native fimbriae were immobilized on a CM5 research-grade sensor chip (BIAcore AB) by amine coupling chemistry using the manufacturer's protocols. Immobilization of 100 response units resulted in optimal responses for Dr fimbriae-DAF, and 300 response units were immobilized for analysis of DaaE trimer-DAF interactions. DAF was dissolved in running buffer and analyzed using an ∼102 dilution series, i.e. DAF (2-200 μm). Analyte was injected over the surface at a flow rate of 20 μl/min for 2 min. The affinities of the interactions were studied under steady state conditions. Average equilibrium responses were measured for six to seven concentrations of DAF. Raw sensorgrams were corrected using the double-subtraction protocol (25Myszka D.G. J. Mol. Recognit. 1999; 12: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar) and by subtracting both the reference flow cell response and the average of eight buffer injections. The resulting data were analyzed with BIAevaluation 3.0 software (BIAcore AB) to globally fit the data and derive equilibrium constants describing the intermolecular interactions. The reported Kd values are the average of at least three independent experiments. To analyze the affinity of the DaaE mutants, standard curves for binding of varying concentrations of DAF234 in solution to DaaE fimbriae or DaaE trimer immobilized on sensor chips were generated by plotting the concentration of DAF against the steady state SPR response at each concentration. For inhibition analysis and Kd calculations, varying concentrations of the mutant proteins (3-0 mg/ml) were incubated with a constant concentration of DAF234 (15 μm in running buffer) for 15-30 min. The solutions of fimbriae or trimer mutants with DAF234 were injected over DaaE fimbriae- or DaaE trimer-immobilized surfaces. Flow rate and contact time were identical to conditions used for standard curve generation. BIAevaluation software 3.0 (BIAcore) was used to calculate the Kd value by using the solution affinity model (26Adamczyk M.J. Moore A. Yu Z. Methods (Orlando). 2000; 20: 319-328Google Scholar). Determination of Ka and Kd Values at Different NaCl Concentrations—Binding constants were determined at different concentrations of NaCl. The running buffer included 75, 150, 300, 500, and 700 mm or 1 m NaCl. DAF for injection was prepared in each buffer so that the running buffer and DAF sample buffer were identical. The affinities of DAF for DaaE, DraE, AfaE-III, AfaE-I, AfaE-V, and NfaE-2 were determined as described above. Because the affinity of DAF for Dr adhesins decreases with increasing ionic strength, higher concentrations of DAF were used in order to bracket the Ka value for the interactions at high salt. The slope of the log Ka versus log [NaCl] plot was determined by linear regression. Site-directed Mutagenesis of daaE—Mutations were introduced into the daaE gene on pUC-Cm or pET-21d plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange® kit as directed by the manufacturer (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Constructs containing the mutations were identified by sequencing the daaE gene. Mannose-resistant Hemagglutination Assay—Mannose-resistant hemagglutination assay with human erythrocytes of blood group O was performed as described previously (20Carnoy C. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 23: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Tissue Culture Cell Adherence Assay—CHO or T24 cells were split into 24-well plates with glass coverslips and grown to confluency in the tissue culture medium. Before the assay, cells were washed twice with Hanks' balanced saline solution and incubated with fresh medium without antibiotics and without fetal bovine serum for 1 h. The bacterial strains were grown overnight in LB medium and harvested and resuspended in 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) to an A600 of 0.3. The bacterial cells were pelleted and resuspended in the tissue culture medium. Then 0.5 ml of each bacterial strain was added to each well. The adherence assay was performed as described previously (4Van Loy C.P. Sokurenko E.V. Samudrala R. Moseley S.L. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The experiment was repeated in triplicate. Crystallization and Diffraction Data Collection for DaaE Adhesin—DaaE adhesin was crystallized in two crystal forms in hanging drop vapor diffusion experiments. Crystal form I (see Table 1) was obtained from a 24 mg/ml protein solution (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm NaCl) equilibrated against 20% PEG 4000, 0.1 m CHES buffer (pH 9.5). Crystal form II came from a 12 mg/ml protein solution (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mm NaCl) of a selenomethionine derivative, equilibrated against 20% PEG 8000, 0.1 m CHES (pH 9.5). 30% glycerol was the cryosolvent for crystal form I, whereas crystal form II was frozen directly from the PEG 8000 solution.TABLE 1Information and statisticsCrystal and unit cell informationCrystal formIIISpace groupP41P3a68.27 Å72.14b68.2772.14c97.7677.31α90°90β9090γ90120No. of monomers/asymmetric unit33Data collection statisticsCrystal formIIIMolecular formWild type DaaESe-met DaaEBeamlineALS 5.0.1SSRL 11-1Resolution1.37 Å3.0Measured reflections534,39784,621Unique reflections83,7758177Completeness (last shell)89.4% (53.1%)90.7% (96.1%)Rmerge (last shell)0.047 (−)0.109 (0.605)Refinement statistics for crystal form IResolution10-1.48 ÅR factor0.173Rfree0.205No. of unique reflections68,189No. of protein atoms3516No. of water molecules414Average B value, protein19.4 Å2Ramachandran quality97.7% in favored regions100.0% in allowed regionsRoot mean square deviation, bond lengths0.010 ÅRoot mean square deviation, bond angles1.29° Open table in a new tab The highest quality crystals were of crystal form I, tetragonal, a = b = 68.26 Å, c = 97.73 Å, space group P41. Diffraction data for the two crystal forms were collected at ALS beamline 5.0.1 and SSRL beamline 11-1. The diffraction data were processed and reduced using HKL2000 (27Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar) as listed in Table 1. Each data set was collected using one crystal. The form II crystal showed ice rings in its diffraction pattern, and this limited the completeness of its data set. Structure Solution and Refinement—The structures of crystal forms I and II were solved using the molecular replacement program, molrep, in the CCP-4 system (28Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar). A subunit from the DraE structure (PDB code 1UT1 (18Pettigrew D. Anderson K.L. Billington J. Cota E.

Three subunits in the asymmetric unit were located by molrep usinga4Å resolution cutoff. The three subunits made up a trimeric structure similar to those found for the related DraE and AfaE-III (18Pettigrew D. Anderson K.L. Billington J. Cota E. Simpson P. Urvil P. Raduzin F. Roversi P.

https://openalex.org/W2067632283,"The effects of hydrogen peroxide on normal and acatalasemic erythrocytes were examined. Severe hemolysis of acatalasemic erythrocytes and a small tyrosine radical signal (g = 2.005) associated with the formation of ferryl hemoglobin were observed upon the addition of less than 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide. However, when the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was increased to 0.5 mm, acatalasemic erythrocytes became insoluble in water and increased the tyrosine radical signal. Polymerization of hemoglobin and aggregation of the erythrocytes were observed. On the other hand, normal erythrocytes exhibited only mild hemolysis by the addition of hydrogen peroxide under similar conditions. From these results, the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide by hemoglobin generates the ferryl hemoglobin species (H-Hb-Fe(IV)=O) plus protein-based radicals (·Hb-Fe(IV)=O). These species induce hemolysis of erythrocytes, polymerization of hemoglobin, and aggregation of the acatalasemic erythrocytes. A mechanism for the onset of Takarara disease is proposed.

In 1952, Takahara reported that Japanese acatalasemia (catalase deficiency) patients suffered from progressive oral gangrene (Takahara disease) as a result of being infected with hydrogen peroxide-generating bacteria (1Takahara S. Lancet. 1952; 263: 1101-1104Abstract Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Subsequently, Swiss and Hungarian acatalasemia-afflicted people were reported, but they did not evidently suffer from the symptomatic features of the disease (2Eaton J.W. Ma M. Scriver C.R Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, New York, NY1995: 2371-2383Google Scholar, 3Goth L. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2001; 27: 512-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The residual catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) activity in Swiss and Hungarian acatalasemic erythrocytes was found to be higher than in the erythrocytes from the Japanese. Ogata et al. (4Ogata M. Sadamoto M. Takahara S. Proc. Jpn. Acad. 1966; 42: 828-832Crossref Google Scholar) suggested the catalase deficiency in the blood to be the etiological cause of the disease. We became interested in the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide in erythrocytes to understand the metabolism of hydrogen peroxide in acatalasemic erythrocytes. The hydrogen peroxide scavenging rates in normal and acatalasemic mouse and human erythrocytes were examined (5Masuoka N. Wakimoto M. Ubuka T. Nakano T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 254: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 6Masuoka N. Wakimoto M. Ohta J. Ishii K. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1361: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Wakimoto M. Masuoka N. Nakano T. Ubuka T. Acta Med. Okayama. 1998; 52: 233-237PubMed Google Scholar, 8Masuoka N. Kodama H. Abe T. Wong D.H. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1637: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). It was found that hydrogen peroxide was dominantly scavenged by hemoglobin in hemolysates of acatalasemic erythrocytes. The scavenging rate was enhanced in the presence of reduced pyridine nucleotides (NAD(P)H) or ascorbic acid (AsA). 2The abbreviations used are: AsA, ascorbic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ESR, electron spin resonance; AAPH, 2,2′-azo-bis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride.2The abbreviations used are: AsA, ascorbic acid; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; ESR, electron spin resonance; AAPH, 2,2′-azo-bis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride. A cyclic process has been proposed for the scavenging mechanism; hydrogen peroxide oxidizes hemoglobin, which is then reduced by NAD(P)H or AsA (8Masuoka N. Kodama H. Abe T. Wong D.H. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1637: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We suspected that during the process, hemoglobin was oxidized to ferryl hemoglobin (H-Hb-Fe(IV)=O) with hydrogen peroxide, and then a comproportionation reaction of Hb-Fe(IV)=O and ferrous hemoglobin generated methemoglobin (H-Hb-Fe(III)+) (9Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Methemoglobin was then further oxidized to radicals of ferryl hemoglobin (·Hb-Fe(IV)=O) with hydrogen peroxide (10Svistunenko D.A. Patel R.P. Voloshchenko S.V. Wilson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the oxidized hemoglobin species in the scavenging process were identified and that a novel property of acatalasemic erythrocytes was subjected to hydrogen peroxide treatment; erythrocytes aggregated to be insoluble in water at a high concentration (≥0.5 mm) of hydrogen peroxide, whereas the severe hemolysis of acatalasemic erythrocytes resulted at low concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (<0.25 mm). Materials—Male mice (8 weeks old) of the C3H/AnLCsaCsa (normal) and C3H/AnLCsbCsb (acatalasemia) strains established by Feinstein et al. (11Feinstein R.N. Braun J.T. Howard J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1967; 120: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) were maintained on a laboratory diet (MF diet, Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) and water ad libitium until experiments. Chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma and Wako Pure Chemical Ind. (Osaka, Japan). General Procedures—Hemoglobin contents were determined by the method of Drabkin and Austin (12Drabkin D.L. Austin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1935; 112: 51-65Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar), and the concentrations of hemoglobin indicated were calculated as tetramer. Catalase activity was measured according to a previous method (5Masuoka N. Wakimoto M. Ubuka T. Nakano T. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1996; 254: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed according to the method of Laemmli (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The concentrations of the materials indicated were those of the final ones used in samples. Preparation of Erythrocyte Suspension and Hemolysates—Mouse blood was collected in heparinized tubes. Erythrocytes were separated by centrifugation and washed three times with 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer containing 152 mm sodium chloride (PBS, pH 7.4). After the last washing, packed cells (100% of erythrocytes) were diluted with PBS, and the suspension was used for experiments. Hemolysates were prepared by dilution of the packed erythrocytes with 9 volumes of water. Treatment of Normal and Acatalasemic Hemolysates with Hydrogen Peroxide—Hemolysates (0.1%) in PBS were treated with 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide, and the spectra (380–680 nm) were recorded. Treatment of Normal and Acatalasemic Erythrocytes with Hydrogen Peroxide—A 2% erythrocyte suspension was treated with 0.0–5.0 mm hydrogen peroxide at 37 °C. For the measurement of the protein leakage from the erythrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide, 0.06 ml of the mixture was immediately diluted with 0.36 ml of PBS at 5 and 30 min after the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Each mixture was centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 5 min, and the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 280 nm. For the determination of the water-soluble protein contents in the erythrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide, 0.06 ml of the incubation mixture was put into a tube containing 0.36 ml of water. The absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 280 nm. For measurement of ESR spectra, a 2% erythrocyte suspension was charged in an ESR tube (inner diameter 5 mm) and incubated with hydrogen peroxide at 37 °C for 5 min. The mixture was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. ESR spectra were measured at 120 K using a JES-FE1XG (JOEL, Tokyo, Japan). Manganese dioxide was used as the internal standard. Hemolysis of Erythrocytes Treated with a Low Concentration (0.1 mm) of Hydrogen Peroxide—A 2% erythrocyte suspension was treated at 37 °C with 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide. Two samples (0.06 ml × 2) were taken from the mixture. One sample was diluted with 0.36 ml of PBS, and the other was diluted with 0.36 ml of water. Both mixtures were centrifuged at 1,100 × g for 5 min, and the absorbance of each supernatant at 540 nm was measured. Hemolysis of erythrocytes in the reaction mixture was calculated according to the method of Miki et al. (14Miki M. Tamai H. Mino N. Yamamoto Y. Niki E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 258: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of glucose or glucose-AsA on hemolysis, an acatalasemic erythrocyte suspension containing 5 mm glucose or 5 mm glucose and 0.2 mm AsA was preincubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The hemolysis of erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide was determined as described above. Hemolysis of erythrocytes with 2,2′-azobis-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) was examined by replacing hydrogen peroxide with 50 mm AAPH. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Erythrocytes Treated with a High Concentration (≥1 mm) of Hydrogen Peroxide—A 2% erythrocyte suspension (0.25 ml) was incubated with 1–10 mm hydrogen peroxide at 37 °C for 5 min. PBS was then immediately added to the mixture to dilute the hydrogen peroxide. After the supernatant was removed, 0.4 ml of sample buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) was added to the residue, and a sample for SDS-PAGE analysis was prepared. For Western blot analysis, the gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. Western blot was carried out with a rabbit polyclonal antibody for mouse hemoglobin (1:2,500, ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc.) and the ECL Western blotting analysis system (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). Microscopic Studies of Erythrocytes—Two percent erythrocyte suspensions were mixed with hydrogen peroxide (at a final concentration of 1 mm). Erythrocytes were placed on glass slides and observed with an Olympus light microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) fitted with a high resolution digital camera system (Penguin 600CL; Pixera Co., Los Gatos, CA). Catalase Activity in Mouse Erythrocytes—The catalase activities of acatalasemic and normal mouse erythrocytes in the presence of 70 μm hydrogen peroxide at 25 °C were 0.99 ± 0.19 and 7.96 ± 0.69 μmol/s/g of hemoglobin, respectively. Spectral Changes of Hemolysates by the Addition of Hydrogen Peroxide—The spectral changes of the acatalasemic hemolysates with the addition of 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide, at which the concentration of hemoglobin was 3.50 μm, are shown in Fig. 1. The spectrum (Fig. 1, spectrum B, λmax 412, 538, 574, and 630 nm) suggests oxidation of ferrous hemoglobin to a mixture of methemoglobin and ferryl hemoglobin species. The formation of methemoglobin is indicated by the shoulder band at 630 nm and the increase of absorbance at 500 nm (15Ogata M. Kobayashi H. Ioku N. Ishii K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 1986; 62: 367-371Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar, 16Gorbunov N.V. Osipov A.N. Day B.W. Zayas-Rivera B. Kagan V.E. Elsayed N.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The formation of ferryl hemoglobin species is suggested by the weak bands at 538 and 574 nm and confirmed by the spectra of the sulfo-derivative (Fig. 1, spectrum C, λmax 618 nm) with the addition of 1 mm sodium sulfide (9Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gorbunov N.V. Osipov A.N. Day B.W. Zayas-Rivera B. Kagan V.E. Elsayed N.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). However, the spectra of normal hemolysates did not change with the addition of hydrogen peroxide (data not shown). Treatment of Erythrocytes with Various Concentrations of Hydrogen Peroxide—Two percent of the erythrocyte suspension contained 75.3 ± 10.8 μm hemoglobin. The protein leakage from erythrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide is shown in Fig. 2A. The protein leakage was not observed after 5 min but was observed 30 min after the addition of 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide. The water-soluble protein contents in the erythrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide are indicated in Fig. 2B. The figure indicates that the acatalasemic erythrocytes treated with more than 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide became insoluble in water 5 min after the addition. Precipitated cells subsequently never became soluble in water again. Radical ESR signals (g = 2.005 and 2.03) were detected when the acatalasemic erythrocyte suspension was treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (concentration of hemoglobin was 69.8 μm, Fig. 3A). These signals were assigned as tyrosine (g = 2.005) and tryptophan peroxyl (g = 2.03) radicals, respectively (10Svistunenko D.A. Patel R.P. Voloshchenko S.V. Wilson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 17Svistunenko D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1546: 365-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). A small signal of g = 6 was also observable and was assigned as methemoglobin (high spin). The relation between the intensity of the tyrosine radical signal and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide is indicated in Fig. 3B. The small signal was observed in the acatalasemic erythrocytes, but the signal did not rapidly increase at levels up to 0.25 mm hydrogen peroxide. The signal intensity increased and reached a peak at 2.0 mm hydrogen peroxide. Time Course of Hemolysis of Erythrocytes Treated with 0.1 mm Hydrogen Peroxide—The hemolysis of erythrocytes treated with 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide is indicated in Fig. 4A. After 30 min had elapsed from the addition of hydrogen peroxide, most (≥60%) of the acatalasemic erythrocytes had become hemolyzed, but normal erythrocytes had not. The hemolysis of acatalasemic erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide was prevented by the addition of glucose and more effectively by the addition of glucose-AsA (Fig. 4C). When compared with the hemolysis caused by the addition of hydrogen peroxide, normal and acatalasemic erythrocytes were treated with AAPH (Fig. 4B). There was no observable difference in hemolysis between them. Color Change of the Erythrocyte Suspension by Addition of Hydrogen Peroxide—When erythrocytes were treated with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide, the color of the acatalasemic erythrocytes dramatically changed from red to dark brown (1Takahara S. Lancet. 1952; 263: 1101-1104Abstract Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The color change was attributable to the oxidation of hemoglobin and precipitation of the erythrocytes by hydrogen peroxide. SDS-PAGE Analysis of Erythrocytes Treated with 1–10 mm Hydrogen Peroxide—The bands for hemoglobin (16 kDa) in the acatalasemic erythrocytes decreased with the treatment of hydrogen peroxide, and the protein bands of greater than 207 kDa increased (Fig. 5). Western blot indicated the latter bands to be polymerized adducts of hemoglobin. On the other hand, the SDS-PAGE pattern of normal erythrocytes was not significantly affected by 1–10 mm hydrogen peroxide treatment. Microscopic Studies of Erythrocytes—Light microscopy revealed the acatalasemic erythrocytes to be deformed and significantly aggregated (Fig. 6B, arrows), whereas normal erythrocytes exhibited no discernable aggregation after treatment with 1 mm hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 6A). First, the visible spectral changes in the hemolysates were examined subsequent to the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Although the spectra of the normal hemolysates did not change after the addition of hydrogen peroxide, the spectra of the acatalasemic hemolysates did (Fig. 1). The spectral changes indicated the formation of methemoglobin (H-Hb-Fe(III)) and the ferryl hemoglobin species (H-Hb-Fe(IV)=O and ·Hb-Fe(IV)=O) (9Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, we examined the effects of hydrogen peroxide on erythrocytes. Although the protein leakage from normal erythrocytes was hardly observed 30 min after the addition of 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide, the protein leakage from the acatalasemic erythrocytes was severe. Surprisingly, with the addition of a higher concentration of hydrogen peroxide, protein leakage from the acatalasemic erythrocytes was reduced (Fig. 2A), and the erythrocytes immediately became insoluble in water in the presence of more than 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, normal erythrocytes treated with hydrogen peroxide exhibited only mild hemolysis. These results indicate that acatalasemic erythrocytes are easily distinguishable from normal erythrocytes after the addition of hydrogen peroxide. A close examination of the time course of hemolysis at a dose level of 0.1 mm hydrogen peroxide would provide a close characterization of hemolysis. It was expected there would be a big difference between normal and acatalasemic erythrocytes (Fig. 4A). However, hemolysis by AAPH, which decomposes with heat to form a carbon-centered radical, indicated that there was in fact no difference in hemolysis between them (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that hydrogen peroxide penetrated through the membrane and generated ferryl hemoglobin species in the acatalasemic but not normal erythrocytes because hydrogen peroxide was decomposed by catalase (8Masuoka N. Kodama H. Abe T. Wong D.H. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1637: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). On the other hand, AAPH cannot penetrate the membrane, and the radical from AAPH equally breaks down the cell membrane of both types of erythrocytes from the outside. The scavenging reaction of hydrogen peroxide in erythrocytes was traced by ESR measurements. A signal of the tyrosine radical was always observable in the acatalasemic erythrocytes. The signal was strongly observed when treated with hydrogen peroxide (1 mm) (Fig. 3A). The relation of the signal intensity to the concentration of hydrogen peroxide indicated that a low concentration of hydrogen peroxide (<0.5 mm) generated only a low concentration of the radical in the acatalasemic erythrocytes. We speculated that the low concentration of hydrogen peroxide oxidized hemoglobin to generate ferryl hemoglobin, and then a reaction of the ferryl hemoglobin with ferrous hemoglobin produced methemoglobin (9Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which concomitantly reacts with hydrogen peroxide to generate the radicals of ferryl hemoglobin (10Svistunenko D.A. Patel R.P. Voloshchenko S.V. Wilson M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7114-7121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This account explains the previous observation that the concentration of methemoglobin in mouse acatalasemic erythrocytes was higher than that found in normal erythrocytes (15Ogata M. Kobayashi H. Ioku N. Ishii K. Proc. Jpn. Acad. Ser. B Phys. Biol. Sci. 1986; 62: 367-371Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the formation of ferryl hemoglobin and the radicals in acatalasemic erythrocytes induces hemolysis. This is because ferryl hemoglobin species are strong oxidants and can promote lipid peroxidation of the membrane (9Giulivi C. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19453-19460Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Gorbunov N.V. Osipov A.N. Day B.W. Zayas-Rivera B. Kagan V.E. Elsayed N.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 6689-6699Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Such hemolysis may explain the clinical finding that heme degradation products in the urine of acatalasemia patients are five times higher than in normal patients (18Takahara S. Ogata M. Hayaishi O. Asada K. Biochemical and Medical Aspects of Active Oxygen. University Park Press, Baltimore, MD1977: 275-292Google Scholar). The prevention of acatalasemic erythrocyte hemolysis by the addition of glucose-AsA and/or glucose (Fig. 4C) was observed. As the scavenging reaction of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of hemoglobin was enhanced by NAD(P)H (8Masuoka N. Kodama H. Abe T. Wong D.H. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1637: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), the preventive effect by glucose was explained by the reduction with NAD(P)H since NADPH generation through the pentose phosphate pathway was enhanced by the generation of hydrogen peroxide and low catalase activity in erythrocytes (19Gaetani G.F. Kirkman H.N. Mangerini R. Ferraris A.M. Blood. 1994; 84: 325-330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the prevention effect of the hemolysis with glucose-AsA is consistent with that of the myocardinal cell damage caused by the ferryl myoglobin species (20Galaris D. Eddy L. Arduini A. Cadenas E. Hochstein P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 160: 1162-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 21Wu F. Altura B.T. Gao J. Barbour R.L. Altura B.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1225: 158-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), the effect is attributable to the direct reduction of oxidized hemoglobin by AsA (8Masuoka N. Kodama H. Abe T. Wong D.H. Nakano T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1637: 46-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To characterize the water-insoluble erythrocytes that resulted from the treatment with a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide (more than 1 mm), insoluble erythrocytes were examined by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analyses. The results indicate that the amounts of hemoglobin decreased and that hemoglobin polymerized to form adducts in the acatalasemic mouse erythrocytes. The ESR spectra revealed the tyrosine radical of ferryl hemoglobin to be generated and increased at more than 0.5 mm hydrogen peroxide. As it was expected that the amounts of the radical would be increased with more than 0.3 mm hydrogen peroxide, a high concentration of the radical would make hemoglobin polymerize to become adducts, and the erythrocytes thus would become insoluble in water. The abnormal reaction with hydrogen peroxide caused the shape change of the erythrocytes, which resembled that of cardiac myocytes treated with lipid hydroperoxide (22Walters F.P. Kennedy F.G. Jones D.P. FEBS Lett. 1983; 163: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, aggregation was observed in the system (Fig. 6). This aggregation may be due to a change in the charge of the erythrocyte membrane induced by the high concentration of the reactive tyrosine radical. The aggregated erythrocytes might impede the normal flow of the blood stream and thus contribute to the oral gangrene observed in Japanese acatalasemia patients (Takahara disease) (1Takahara S. Lancet. 1952; 263: 1101-1104Abstract Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus, we propose the catabolism of hydrogen peroxide in acatalasemic erythrocytes as depicted in Fig. 7.

In this study, yeast Pma1 H+-ATPase has served as a model to examine the role of the C-terminal membrane domain in ATPase stability and targeting to the plasma membrane. Successive truncations were constructed from the middle of the major cytoplasmic loop to the middle of the extended cytoplasmic tail, adding back the C-terminal membrane-spanning helices one at a time. When the resulting constructs were expressed transiently in yeast, there was a steady increase in half-life from 70 min in Pma1Δ452 to 348 min in Pma1Δ901, but even the longest construct was considerably less stable than wild-type ATPase (t½ = 11 h). Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy showed that 11 of 12 constructs were arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded in the proteasome. The only truncated ATPase that escaped the ER, Pma1Δ901, traveled slowly to the plasma membrane, where it hydrolyzed ATP and supported growth. Limited trypsinolysis showed Pma1Δ901 to be misfolded, however, resulting in premature delivery to the vacuole for degradation. As model substrates, this series of truncations affirms the importance of the entire C-terminal domain to yeast H+-ATPase biogenesis and defines a sequence element of 20 amino acids in the carboxyl tail that is critical to ER escape and trafficking to the plasma membrane.

The single most abundant protein in the yeast plasma membrane is a 100-kDa H+-ATPase that accounts for at least 10% of total plasma membrane protein (1Morsomme P. Slayman C.W. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Encoded by the PMA1 gene (2Serrano R. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Fink G.R. Nature. 1986; 319: 689-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar) and belonging to the widely distributed family of P-type cation-transporting ATPases (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H.

Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar), the yeast H+-ATPase acts physiologically to pump protons out of the cell, creating a transmembrane potential that drives the uptake of amino acids, sugars, and other nutrients (1Morsomme P. Slayman C.W. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Because of its abundance, the H+-ATPase has attracted considerable attention over the past two decades, both for mechanistic studies of ATP-coupled proton transport and, more recently, as a model system to explore the biogenesis of polytopic membrane proteins. A particularly fruitful approach to biogenesis studies has come from the use of site-directed mutagenesis to probe structure-function relationships in key regions of the H+-ATPase polypeptide (1Morsomme P. Slayman C.W. Goffeau A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1469: 133-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Of the mutations that have been made to date, a significant subset cause partial or complete blocks in ATPase biogenesis, giving direct evidence for the critical nature of proper protein folding. Some of the mutant forms are severely defective and become arrested in the endoplasmic reticulum, from where they are shipped to the proteasome for degradation (e.g. see Refs. 6DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F.

Others, with more subtle abnormalities in folding, are transported further along the secretory pathway to reach the Golgi (pma1-7, Ref. 9Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) or even the plasma membrane (pma1-10, Ref. 10Gong X. Chang A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), before being recognized as abnormal and committed to the endosomal/vacuolar pathway for degradation. In addition to their use in mapping amino acid residues within the Pma1 polypeptide that are important for folding and trafficking, both kinds of mutant have been used to identify novel components of the yeast secretory pathway, such as Eps1p, a protein-disulfide isomerase implicated in ER quality control (7Wang Q. Chang A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5972-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and Ast1p, a protein involved in transport from the Golgi to the plasma membrane (9Chang A. Fink G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The work to be described in this paper has taken a systematic look at features of the yeast H+-ATPase structure and topology that are required for successful delivery to the plasma membrane. We have focused in particular on the C-terminal portion of the molecule, given the variability of this region during the evolution of P-type ATPases (12Serrano R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 947: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). On the one hand, members of the P2 subfamily, including mammalian Na+,K+- and Ca2+-ATPases as well as the fungal and plant H+-ATPases, have six C-terminal transmembrane helices, designated M5 through M10 (3Lutsenko S. Kaplan J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15607-15613Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). At the other extreme, heavy metal ATPases of the P1 family have only two C-terminal helices, whereas the P3-type Kdp ATPase of Escherichia coli is intermediate between the first two groups, with four such helices. To dissect the role of the C-terminal portion of yeast Pma1 ATPase in biogenesis and trafficking, we have constructed a set of mutants with truncations after each of the last six transmembrane segments, from M5 through M10. Whereas the results reveal a clear correlation between protein length and intracellular stability, all but one of the mutant ATPases fails to exit the endoplasmic reticulum. Only Pma1Δ901, truncated midway along the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail, is successfully targeted to the plasma membrane, where it is capable of splitting ATP and supporting growth. Thus, all six C-terminal membrane helices and at least a portion of the C terminus are essential for proper folding and trafficking of the H+-ATPase through the secretory pathway. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. For transient expression experiments, the mutant pma1 allele to be studied was introduced on either a centromeric or integrating plasmid into yeast strains with the appropriate mutant background (BMY40, W303-1B pep4Δ, WG4a 11/22a) and in which the chromosomal copy of PMA1 had been placed under control of the GAL1 promoter (see Table 1). Transformants were selected on 2% galactose in complete synthetic medium lacking uracil and the relevant auxotrophic amino acid(s) (Bio 101 Inc., Carlsbad, CA). For the transient expression of hemagglutinin HA 2The abbreviations used are: HA, hemagglutinin; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; TNP-ATP, 2′,3′-O-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)-adenosine-5′-triphosphate; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GM, glucose-metabolizing; CS, carbon-starved. -tagged pma1 alleles, chromosomal GAL1p-PMA1 expression was first turned off by incubating the cells for 3 h in medium containing 2% glucose instead of galactose. Expression of the HA-tagged Pma1 mutant was then induced by incubating the cells at 39 °C for the appropriate time (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol.

Standard yeast media and genetic manipulations were as described by Sherman et al. (16Sherman F. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Yeast transformations were performed as described (17Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using the Alkali-Cation Yeast Transformation kit (Bio 101). Plasmids—Truncated pma1Δ alleles were made in plasmid YCplac22-2HSEpr-HA-PMA1-MluI, a derivative of YCplac22-2HSEpr-HA-PMA1 (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) containing an MluI site at the TAA stop codon of the PMA1 gene. Another MluI site was built into mutagenic oligonucleotides used to introduce a second TAA stop codon at the desired location within the PMA1 coding sequence in the plasmid template. Intervening DNA sequences were then removed by digestion with MluI, and the construct encoding a truncated ATPase product, with 3′-flanking sequence intact, was generated by circularization of the purified vector DNA fragment. The same strategy was used to create 2HSEpr-HA-pma1 constructs in the integrative vector pRS303-2HSE (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) for targeting to the chromosomal HIS3 locus. Plasmid-encoded wild-type and mutant alleles of PMA1 used in this study were tagged with a single copy of the 9-amino acid HA epitope (YPYDVPDYA), inserted in frame between codons 2 and 3 of the PMA1 coding sequence (6DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used for in vitro mutagenesis, and all mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. For the chromosomal integration of mutant pma1 alleles by homologous recombination at the PMA1 locus, plasmid pGW201 (18Wang G. Tamas M. Hall M.J. Pascal-Ahuir A. Perlin D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25438-25445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was modified by adding two unique restriction sites: an NcoI site at the PMA1 ATG start codon and an MluI site at the PMA1 TAA stop codon. These two new restriction sites were used to introduce an HA-tagged copy of the PMA1 gene, producing plasmid pBM432. The pma1Δ901 allele was constructed in pBM432 by replacement of the 1.1-kb BamHI-MluI fragment with the corresponding fragment from YCplac22-2HSE-HA-pma1Δ901. A 6-kb HindIII fragment from this construct was used to transform yeast strain BMY58 (Table 1). Transformants selected on complete synthetic medium lacking uracil were screened by immunoblotting for expression of truncated ATPase Pma1Δ901. Immunofluorescence—Intracellular structures containing HA-tagged ATPase were visualized by confocal microscopy as described previously (6DeWitt N.D. dos Santos C.F. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21744-21751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed, treated with Zymolyase T-100, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, and stained for immunofluorescence (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-HA polyclonal (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., Ltd., Nagoya, Japan), diluted 1:100; anti-HA.11 monoclonal 16B12 (Babco, Richmond, CA), diluted 1:150; anti-vacuolar H+-ATPase 60-kDa subunit monoclonal 13D11-B2 from raw ascites fluid (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), diluted 1:150; and rabbit anti-Kar2p polyclonal antibody (provided by M. Rose), diluted 1:2500. Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse IgGs conjugated, respectively, to FITC and Texas Red (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA), served as fluorescent secondary antibodies and were used at 1:100 dilutions. For double labeling experiments, both primary antibodies were present during the initial incubation, and both secondary antibodies were present during the subsequent incubation. To control for spurious antibody cross-reactivity, non-induced cells were simultaneously fixed and stained with each set of antibodies. Samples were then mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Redding, PA). Cells were observed under a Zeiss L510 scanning confocal microscope using dual channel filters for simultaneous visualization of FITC and Texas Red fluorochromes. All images were taken with a 63 × 1.4 numerical aperture Plan-Apochromat III differential interference contrast objective (Zeiss). In time course experiments, microscope settings were unchanged throughout the experiment in order to obtain a semi-quantitative signal. Cross-talk between FITC and Texas Red was avoided through the use of the Zeiss L510 digital signal processor. The absence of bleed-through was confirmed by checking that the signal disappeared when viewed with single-wave-length filter blocks. Images were collected with LSM5 software (Zeiss) and modified by contrast stretching and merging, using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 (Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA). Total Protein Extracts and Immunoblotting—Total protein extracts were prepared as described by Volland et al. (19Volland C. Garnier C. Haguenauer-Tsapis R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23767-23771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Log phase cells (A600 nm = 1.5) were suspended in 0.5 ml of water and then lysed by adding 50 μl of 1.85 m NaOH, 5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were precipitated by adding 50 μl of 50% (m/v) trichloroacetic acid. The resulting pellets were resuspended in 15 μl of 1 m Trizma Base and 30 μl of 3× Laemmli SDS-PAGE loading buffer (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), resolved on 8% polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE), and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon, Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). HA-tagged ATPases were quantified by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-HA polyclonal antibody diluted 1:4000 (Medical and Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan) and Kar2p by immunoblotting with rabbit anti-Kar2p polyclonal antibody diluted 1:20,000 (provided by M. Rose), followed by incubation with 125I-protein A, autoradiography, and phosphorimaging analysis (Storm 840; Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and the ECL chemiluminescent detection system (Amersham Biosciences). For quantitative immunoblotting of the HA-tagged ATPase in sucrose gradient fractions (see below), proteins were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated from 100-μl samples. Dolichol phosphate mannose synthase (Dpm1p) was detected on immunoblots using monoclonal antibody 5C5 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Subcellular Fractionation—Sixty-ml cultures were grown to an A600 nm of ∼1.0, shifted to glucose for 3 h, and then induced at 39 °C for 15 min as detailed above (see “Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions”). Samples equivalent to 25 A600 nm units were taken immediately before the temperature shift (t = 0) and at specified time points after induction. Sodium azide was added immediately to a final concentration of 10 mm, and cells were then centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min prior to resuspension in STE10 buffer (10% sucrose in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA) supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, and chymostatin, at 2 μg/ml each, plus phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride to 1 mm final concentration). Cells were broken by vortexing with 0.45-mm glass beads (4 × 1-min pulses). Lysates were recovered, and the remaining beads were washed with 400 μl of STE10 plus protease inhibitors. Washes were combined with primary lysates, and these suspensions were centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min. Supernatants were applied to 5-ml 20-60% linear sucrose gradients, ultracentrifuged in an SW55Ti rotor for 16 h at 100,000 × g, and the gradients fractionated into 300-μl volumes. Limited Trypsinolysis of Gradient-purified Plasma Membranes—Plasma membranes were prepared as described (21Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Trypsinolysis was performed according to Nakamoto et al. (15Nakamoto R.K. Rao R. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7940-7949Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using trypsin/protein ratios as stated. ATP Hydrolysis and Protein Determination—Activity of the plasma membrane H+-ATPase was assayed at 30 °C using a standard (21Miranda M. Allen K.E. Pardo J.P. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22485-22490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or microscale ATPase assay (22Monk B.C. Kurtz M.B. Marrinan J.A. Perlin D.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6826-6836Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured as described (23Lowry O.H. Roseborough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or as modified by Ambesi et al. (24Ambesi A. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 251: 127-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Design and Expression of Truncated ATPases—Fig. 1 illustrates the topology of yeast Pma1 H+-ATPase, which is embedded in the lipid bilayer by four transmembrane helices (M1-M4) toward the amino terminus of the protein and six (M5-M10) toward the C terminus (25Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The starting point for this study was a truncation at Glu901, midway along the C-terminal tail. This modest deletion of 18 amino acids was studied previously and was shown to allow both measurable ATPase activity and growth (26Mason A.B. Kardos T.B. Monk B.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To judge the effects of longer C-terminal deletions on ATPase biogenesis and stability, stepwise terminations were introduced at eight additional points upstream of Glu901 (Fig. 1). These were as follows: Ala881 (immediately following M10); Tyr873 (in the middle of M10); Asp851, Ile820, Ile785, Pro753, and Asp718 (in the small loops following M9, M8, M7, M6, and M5, respectively); and His686 (at the C-terminal end of the large cytoplasmic loop). The final and most amino-terminal truncation was at residue Asp452, near the middle of the large cytoplasmic loop and within the N (nucleotide-binding) domain of the ATPase (25Kuhlbrandt W. Zeelen J. Dietrich J. Science. 2002; 297: 1692-1696Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). This mutation occurred spontaneously and was included in the series after preliminary studies suggested that it behaved distinctively when expressed in yeast. Mutant pma1Δ constructs tagged with a single HA epitope at the amino terminus were introduced into the yeast centromeric expression plasmid YCplac22-2HSE-HA-PMA1-MluI, placing them under control of two heat-activated promoter elements (2HSE). They were then transformed into yeast strain BMY40, in which the chromosomal copy of the PMA1 gene is under control of the GAL1 promoter (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For expression studies, cells were grown in galactose medium at 23 °C (wild-type allele ON; mutant allele OFF) and then shifted to glucose medium at 23 °C for 3 h to turn off expression of the chromosomal PMA1 gene and empty the secretory pathway of wild-type ATPase. Cells were then incubated for 15 min at 39 °C to induce a short pulse of synthesis of mutant ATPase before being returned to 23 °C, with the HA tag providing a convenient way to track the synthesis, stability, and intracellular location of the mutant protein (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Stability of Truncated ATPase as a Function of Protein Length—The first step was to examine the stability of the truncated ATPases. For this purpose, total protein extracts were made from cells taken immediately before (t = 0 min) and at various times after expression had been induced at 39 °C. Quantitative immunoblotting with anti-HA antibody revealed a striking relationship between the length of the mutant ATPase and its half-life (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The shortest polypeptide (Pma1Δ452) was by far the least stable, with a t½ of only ∼70 min. Adding back the remainder of the large cytoplasmic loop (in Pma1Δ686) increased the t½ to 116 min, and the successive addition of transmembrane helices M5-M10 led to further stepwise increases from 152 to 288 min. Pma1Δ901, which retained part of the C-terminal tail, had the longest half-life (∼348 min), although still only about one-half that of wild-type Pma1 ATPase (∼11 h) (27Benito B. Moreno E. Lagunas R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1063: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Thus, virtually the entire 100-kDa polypeptide chain is required for maximal stability, with critical contributions coming from all six transmembrane helices downstream of the major cytoplasmic domain and even from the C-terminal tail.TABLE 2Stability of truncated H+-ATPase mutantsMutant H+-ATPaseNumber of membrane helicest½aCalculated from an average of a least three separate time courses analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting.Wild type1011 hΔ452470 minΔ6864116 minΔ7185152 minΔ7536162 minΔ7857186 minΔ8208217 minΔ8519244 minΔ8739297 minΔ88110288 minΔ90110348 mina Calculated from an average of a least three separate time courses analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting. Open table in a new tab Trafficking of Truncated ATPases—To learn more about the processing of the truncated ATPases, their intracellular trafficking was monitored by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3). In keeping with the results of earlier studies (11Ferreira T. Mason A.B. Pypaert M. Allen K.E. Slayman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21027-21040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), HA-tagged wild-type ATPase could be detected as early as 15 min after induction of expression, and it was then exported efficiently through the secretory pathway to reach the plasma membrane by 60 min post-induction. The shortest truncation product, Pma1Δ452, was trapped in a predominantly perinuclear location and degraded rapidly, becoming undetectable after 60 min. By contrast, the next shortest truncation product (Pma1Δ686) gave a punctate staining pattern that persisted throughout the 180-min time course. Similar patterns were seen for Pma1Δ718 through Pma1Δ881, which also failed to reach the cell surface but remained visible for at least 180 min; confocal images for three of these mutants are included in Fig. 3. Of the mutants that were studied, only Pma1Δ901 was transported to the plasma membrane, with a trafficking behavior very similar to that of the wild-type ATPase. The punctate staining patterns seen in Fig. 3 resemble ER-derived tubulo-vesicular structures that have been reported previously for misfolded full-length Pma1p mutants (7Wang Q. Chang A.
