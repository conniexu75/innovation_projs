https://openalex.org/W2161821474,"Receptor tyrosine kinase genes were sequenced in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and matched normal tissue. Somatic mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene EGFR were found in 15of 58 unselected tumors from Japan and 1 of 61 from the United States. Treatment with the EGFR kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa) causes tumor regression in some patients with NSCLC, more frequently in Japan. EGFR mutations were found in additional lung cancer samples from U.S. patients who responded to gefitinib therapy and in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line that was hypersensitive to growth inhibition by gefitinib, but not in gefitinib-insensitive tumors or cell lines. These results suggest that EGFR mutations may predict sensitivity to gefitinib."

Starting with cobalt nanocrystals, we show that their reaction in solution with oxygen and either sulfur or selenium leads to the formation of hollow nanocrystals of the resulting oxide and chalcogenides. This process provides a general route to the synthesis of hollow nanostructures of a large number of compounds. A simple extension of the process yielded platinum–cobalt oxide yolk-shell nanostructures, which may serve as nanoscale reactors in catalytic applications."

To probe for function of RNA silencing during infection of human cells by a DNA virus, we recorded the small RNA profile of cells infected by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). We show that EBV expresses several microRNA (miRNA) genes. Given that miRNAs function in RNA silencing pathways either by targeting messenger RNAs for degradation or by repressing translation, we identified viral regulators of host and/or viral gene expression."

https://openalex.org/W2162411580,"A general caging method for proteins that are regulated by phosphorylation was used to study the in vivo biochemical action of cofilin and the subsequent cellular response. By acute and local activation of a chemically engineered, light-sensitive phosphocofilin mimic, we demonstrate that cofilin polymerizes actin, generates protrusions, and determines the direction of cell migration. We propose a role for cofilin that is distinct from its role as an actin-depolymerizing factor."
https://openalex.org/W1969232586,"We report the OH stretching vibrational spectra of size-selected H + (H 2 O) n clusters through the region of the pronounced “magic number” at n = 21 in the cluster distribution. Sharp features are observed in the spectra and assigned to excitation of the dangling OH groups throughout the size range 6 ≤ n ≤ 27. A multiplet of such bands appears at small cluster sizes. This pattern simplifies to a doublet at n = 11, with the doublet persisting up to n = 20, but then collapsing to a single line in the n = 21 and n = 22 clusters and reemerging at n = 23. This spectral simplification provides direct evidence that, for the magic number cluster, all the dangling OH groups arise from water molecules in similar binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2015617063,"Uganda provides the clearest example that human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is preventable if populations are mobilized to avoid risk. Despite limited resources, Uganda has shown a 70% decline in HIV prevalence since the early 1990s, linked to a 60% reduction in casual sex. The response in Uganda appears to be distinctively associated with communication about acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) through social networks. Despite substantial condom use and promotion of biomedical approaches, other African countries have shown neither similar behavioral responses nor HIV prevalence declines of the same scale. The Ugandan success is equivalent to a vaccine of 80% effectiveness. Its replication will require changes in global HIV/AIDS intervention policies and their evaluation."

Spectral changes with cluster size demonstrate that the chain structures at small sizes (n less, similar 10) develop into two-dimensional net structures (approximately 10 < n < 21), and then into nanometer-scaled cages (n >/= 21)."
https://openalex.org/W2121472298,"Forest emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such as isoprene and other terpenes, play a role in the production of tropospheric ozone and aerosols. In a northern Michigan forest, the direct measurement of total OH reactivity, which is the inverse of the OH lifetime, was significantly greater than expected. The difference between measured and expected OH reactivity, called the missing OH reactivity, increased with temperature, as did emission rates for terpenes and other BVOCs. These measurements are consistent with the hypothesis that unknown reactive BVOCs, perhaps terpenes, provide the missing OH reactivity."
https://openalex.org/W2037718442,"Vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) 1 and 2 show a mutually exclusive distribution in the adult brain that suggests specialization for synapses with different properties of release. Consistent with this distribution, inactivation of the VGLUT1 gene silenced a subset ofexcitatory neurons in the adult. However, the same cell populations exhibited VGLUT1-independent transmission early in life. Developing hippocampal neurons transiently coexpressed VGLUT2 and VGLUT1 at distinct synaptic sites with different short-term plasticity. The loss of VGLUT1 also reduced the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles. Thus, VGLUT1 plays an unanticipated role in membrane trafficking at the nerve terminal."

The distribution of the site's small burned flint fragments suggests that burning occurred in specific spots, possibly indicating hearth locations. Wood of six taxa was burned at the site, at least three of which are edible—olive, wild barley, and wild grape."
https://openalex.org/W2041228111,"The formation and sinking of biogenic particles mediate vertical mass fluxes and drive elemental cycling in the ocean1. Whereas marine sciences have focused primarily on particle production by phytoplankton growth, particle formation by the assembly of organic macromolecules has almost been neglected2,3. Here we show, by means of a combined experimental and modelling study, that the formation of polysaccharide particles is an important pathway to convert dissolved into particulate organic carbon during phytoplankton blooms, and can be described in terms of aggregation kinetics. Our findings suggest that aggregation processes in the ocean cascade from the molecular scale up to the size of fast-settling particles, and give new insights into the cycling and export of biogeochemical key elements such as carbon, iron and thorium."
https://openalex.org/W2085992142,"The selective recognition of ubiquitin conjugates by proteasomes is a key step in protein degradation. The receptors that mediate this step have yet to be clearly defined although specific candidates exist. Here we show that the proteasome directly recognizes ubiquitin chains through a specific subunit, Rpn10, and also recognizes chains indirectly through Rad23, a reversibly bound proteasome cofactor. Both binding events can be observed in purified biochemical systems. A block substitution in the chain-binding ubiquitin interacting motif of RPN10 when combined with a null mutation in RAD23 results in a synthetic defect in protein degradation consistent with the view that the direct and indirect recognition modes function to some extent redundantly in vivo. Rad23 and the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6 both bind proteasome subunit Rpn1 through N-terminal ubiquitin-like domains. Surprisingly, Rad23 and Ubp6 do not compete with each other for proteasome binding. Thus, Rpn1 may act as a scaffold to assemble on the proteasome multiple proteins that act to either bind or hydrolyze multiubiquitin chains.

There is currently no general agreement as to the identity or multiplicity of the relevant ubiquitin receptors nor as to whether such receptors are intrinsic proteasome subunits or “shuttling” factors that bind ubiquitinated species and subsequently deliver them to the proteasome. Among the putative shuttling factors having affinity for both the proteasome and ubiquitin conjugates is a family of proteins exemplified by the Rad23 protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (27Hartmann-Petersen R.

The UBL domain of Rad23 binds proteasomes with a higher affinity than does the full-length protein (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and for the human Rad23 homolog hHR23a binding of ubiquitin via the UBA domain disrupts the intramolecular interactions between the UBL and UBA domains (18Walters K.J. Lech P.J. Goh A.M. Wang Q. Howley P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 12694-12699Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In vivo, modulating the interactions between the UBL and UBA domains might serve to potentiate the binding of the Rad23-conjugate complex to the proteasome. Despite the logical appeal of the shuttling hypothesis, it remains controversial. A positive role for UBL-UBA proteins in degradation is supported by the observations that some model substrates are stabilized in yeast cells lacking Rad23 and in cells lacking Dsk2, another UBL-UBA family member (9Funakoshi M. Sasaki T. Nishimoto T. Kobayashi H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 17Wilkinson C.R. Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Stone M. Wallace M.

Additionally, depletion of hHR23 by small interfering RNA has been shown to lead to the stabilization of p53 in mammalian cells (30Glockzin S. Ogi F.X. Hengstermann A. Scheffner M. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8960-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At variance with a role for Rad23 and similar molecules in promoting degradation is the finding that the influence of Rad23 on the in vitro proteasomal degradation of artificial and native substrates appears to be exclusively inhibitory (25Raasi S. Pickart C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8951-8959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 30Glockzin S. Ogi F.X. Hengstermann A. Scheffner M. Blattner C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8960-8969Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In addition, Rad4 (a Rad23-binding protein) is destablized in rad23Δ cells, although this has been attributed to Rad23-dependent inhibition of Rad4 ubiquitination (31Lommel L. Ortolan T. Chen L. Madura K. Sweder K.S. Curr. Genet. 2002; 42: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 32Ng J.M. Vermeulen W. van der Horst G.T. Bergink S. Sugasawa K. Vrieling H. Hoeijmakers J.H. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 1630-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, Rad23 stabilizes Pds1 and model proteasome substrates (33Clarke D.J. Mondesert G. Segal M. Bertolaet B.L. Jensen S. Wolff M. Henze M. Reed S.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 1997-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Ortolan T.G. Tongaonkar P. Lambertson D. Chen L. Schauber C. Madura K. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 601-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and causes the accumulation of undefined ubiquitinated species (21Chen L. Madura K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4902-4913Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). However, such overexpression results do not necessarily imply that Rad23 antagonizes protein degradation when present at wild-type levels. The capacity of proteasomes to recognize substrates directly through covalently attached ubiquitin chains has long been known (4Beal R. Deveraux Q. Xia G. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 861-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 35Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 2400-2408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S5a was the first proteasome subunit implicated in conjugate binding (2Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, cells lacking Rpn10, the yeast ortholog of S5a, proved to be viable, implying that other ubiquitin receptors must exist (3van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). rpn10Δ cells are slightly sensitive to canavanine, an arginine analog whose toxicity is typically enhanced in proteolysis-deficient mutants (3van Nocker S. Sadis S. Rubin D.M. Glickman M. Fu H. Coux O. Wefes I. Finley D. Vierstra R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6020-6028Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the canavanine sensitivity does not map to the ubiquitin interacting motif (UIM) but rather to the von Willebrand factor type A domain (36Fu H. Reis N. Lee Y. Glickman M.H. Vierstra R.D. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 7096-7107Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), which is required for proteasome stability under conventional purification conditions (37Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D. Cell. 1998; 94: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1A). This result and the observation that free Rpn10 cross-links to ubiquitin chains whereas proteasome-associated Rpn10 does not have led to the view that Rpn10 is not a true proteasomal ubiquitin receptor (6Lam Y.A. Lawson T.G. Velayutham M. Zweier J.L. Pickart C.M. Nature. 2002; 416: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Recently, rpn10Δ proteasomes were purified in an intact state and found to be partially defective in conjugate recognition (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). However, the participation of the UIM in conjugate recognition has remained an open question especially as it cannot be excluded that rpn10Δ proteasomes (even when intact) have structural defects that could affect chain recognition by other proteasome subunits. Paralleling the uncertainty over chain binding by the UIM element in the proteasome in vitro is the question of whether it has a positive role in protein degradation in vivo. These issues are addressed below. Using purified systems, we provide evidence that proteasomes recognize ubiquitin chains directly via the UIM element of Rpn10 but also indirectly through association with UBL-UBA proteins. Furthermore, in vivo experiments identify specific genetic interactions between the rpn10-uim mutation and deletions of either RAD23 or DSK2, supporting the model that both direct and indirect pathways exist for chain recognition by the proteasome. Strain Construction—Yeast strains were constructed according to standard methods and are listed in Table I. For the preparation of the rpn10-uim and control strains, fragments were excised from pEL92e and pEL91b, respectively, and transformed into yeast. To prepare these plasmids, the 1.2-kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pAG25 (38Goldstein A.L. McCusker J.H. Yeast. 1999; 15: 1541-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar) bearing the natMX cassette was cloned into pBluescript SK+. A 640-bp fragment corresponding to the RPN10 open reading frame beginning 85 bp past the start codon and ending 64 bp past the stop codon was cloned upstream of the natMX cassette. To generate the mutant allele, bases 674–698 were substituted with 5′-GGAT CCG GAA AAC AAC AAT AAT AAC-3′ corresponding to a change at residues 228–232 from LAMAL to NNNNN and generating a silent BamHI site upstream of the target mutation. A 320-bp fragment of the RPN10 3′-untranslated region beginning 65 bp past the stop codon was cloned downstream of the natMX cassette. This fragment overlapped precisely with the 3′ end and stop codon of the adjacent PPX1 gene. Integrants were verified by PCR, and the presence of the mutation was determined by restriction mapping.Table IYeast strainsStrainRelevant genotypeSY73MATα rpt1::HIS3 (pEL35 [ProA-TEV-RPT1-TRP1]) rpn10::RPN10-natMXSY74MATα rpt1::HIS3 (pEL35 [ProA-TEV-RPT1-TRP1]) rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMXSDL135MATa pre1::PRE1-TEV-ProA-HIS3SDL145MATa rpn11::RPN11-TEV-ProA-HIS3 ubp6::URA3SY290bMATa rpn11::RPN11-TEV-ProA-HI3SSY293eMATa rpn11::RPN11-TEV-ProA-HIS3 rad23::kanMX dsk2::klTRP1SY294bMATa rpn11::RPN11-TEV-ProA-HIS3 rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMXSY295aMATa rpn11::RPN11-TEV-ProA-HIS3 rad23::kanMX dsk2::klTRP1 rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMXSY316kMATα rpn10::RPN10-natMXSY317fMATα rpn10::RPN10-natMX dsk2::klTRP1SY318jMATα rpn10::RPN10-natMX rad23::kanMXSY319iMATα rpn10::RPN10-natMX rad23::kanMX dsk2::klTRP1SY304bMATα rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMXSY305cMATα rpn10::rpn10-uim-natM X dsk2::klTRP1SY306aMATα rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMX rad23::kanMXSY307fMATα rpn10::rpn10-uim-natMX rad23::kanMX dsk2::klTRP1 Open table in a new tab For the preparation of rad23::kanMX, dsk2::klTRP1, and ubp6::uraMX deletions, precise substitutions of the open reading frames were made with the markers indicated (39Wach A.

Yeast. 1999; 15: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Integration was verified by PCR. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant Ubp6 was purified as described previously (41Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). GST fusion proteins of Rad23 and Rpn1 were expressed in BL21(DE3) cells and purified in the presence of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Where indicated, proteins were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP as described (42Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Rad23 fusion proteins were cleaved from the GST moiety with thrombin, which was subsequently inhibited with 4 μm aminoethyl-benzene sulfonyl fluoride. His6-Cdc34 was purified in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% Triton X-100 and eluted from nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin with 250 mm imidazole in purification buffer. The following plasmids were used for the expression of recombinant proteins: pDL74 (GST-Ubp6), pRG22 (GST-Rad23), pRG63 (GST-Rad23-UBL (residues 1–77)), pDC4 (GST-ΔUBL-Rad23 (residues 78–398)), and pEL1 (His6-Cdc34). Synthesis of Cdc34 Conjugates—All conjugates were prepared in the presence of 1.2 μm Uba1-His6 and conjugation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 mm ATP) for 19 h at 30 °C and with components indicated in Table II. Decreasing the ratio of ubiquitin to Cdc34 in the conjugation reaction produces progressively shorter conjugates. Additionally, native Cdc34 autoubiquitinates somewhat more efficiently than His6-Cdc34. Cdc34 and Uba1-His6 were purified from yeast as described previously (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M.

Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar), and bovine ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma.Table IIConditions for ubiquitin-conjugate synthesisConjugatesFigs.Cdc34 (Type)Cdc34UbiquitinμmμmLong1, 3BHis6450Short1His6820Long3ANative450Medium3ANative850Short3ANative1250 Open table in a new tab Native Gel Electrophoretic Mobility Assays—Ligands were mixed with proteasome and incubated for 40 min at 30 °C. All of the binding reactions contained fixed volumes: 3 μl of proteasome, 4 μl of Cdc34 conjugates, and 4 μl of each Rad23 species. To make this possible, the molarity of each protein was adjusted to the necessary value with buffers identical to the original stock. Complexes were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE (3.5%) in a solution of 90 mm Tris base, 90 mm boric acid, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.5 mm ATP and were electrophoresed for 3.5 h at 100 V and 4 °C. Proteasomes were visualized by suc-LLVY-AMC hydrolysis as described previously (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Proteasome Purification—For the native gel electrophoretic mobility assays, wild-type and rpn10-uim proteasomes were purified from SY73 and SY74 essentially as described and carried out in the absence of ATP (41Leggett D.S.

For the competition assays, core particle and proteasome lacking Ubp6 were purified in the presence of ATP from SDL135 and SDL145, respectively (41Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). For the endogenous conjugate association assay, proteasome was purified from SY290b, SY293e, SY294b, and SY295a. Purifications were carried out in the presence of 1 mm ATP, and salt was omitted from the wash. Competition Assays—IgG resin was charged with proteasome and core particle as described above and resuspended as a 25% slurry in purification buffer. An aliquot was removed, treated with tobacco etch virus protease, and the protein concentration was measured and used to calculate the quantities present on the resin. Bovine serum albumin was added to the slurries at 0.5 mg/ml. Aliquots of 400 μl were mixed with 25-μl mixtures containing 10 pmol of radiolabeled Rad23 (10,000 cpm/pmol) and cold competitor as indicated. After 15 min of binding at room temperature, resin was washed five times with 5 volumes of buffer per wash. Bound material was quantified by scintillation counting. Canavanine Sensitivity—Strains SY304 through SY307 and SY316 through SY319 were grown overnight, diluted 25- or 50-fold, grown 4 h at 30 °C, diluted to an A600 of 0.2, prepared as 3-fold serial dilutions, and spotted on plates. Plates lacking and containing canavanine sulfate were grown for 3 and 4 days, respectively, at 30 °C. Docking of Ubiquitin Conjugates to the Proteasome by Rad23—One possible argument against the shuttling hypothesis is that the proteasome has a high intrinsic affinity for conjugates (43Thrower J.S. Hoffman L. Rechsteiner M. Pickart C.M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 94-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), and thus, its affinity does not need to be strengthened by extrinsic factors. We recently developed a direct assay for ubiquitin conjugate binding by the proteasome, employing nondenaturing gel electrophoresis followed by proteasome visualization via an in-gel activity stain (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). We have used in vitro synthesized conjugates (Fig. 1B) in this assay to test whether Rad23 can promote the binding to proteasomes of conjugates that would otherwise not show stable binding. As shown in Fig. 1C, complexes of low electrophoretic mobility can be formed when Rad23, the proteasome, and ubiquitin conjugates are mixed. All three components must be added for the low mobility species to form, indicating that the electrophoretically retarded species is a ternary complex as further verified below. Formation of the retarded ternary complex requires the UBL domain of Rad23 (Fig. 1C) as well as the UBA-containing C-terminal domain (Fig. 1D). Additionally, if the N-terminal UBL domain of Rad23 and the C-terminal UBA domain are added as separate polypeptides to the reaction, the retarded complex does not form (Fig. 1E). This result indicates that ternary complex formation is critically dependent on the ability of Rad23 to bind the proteasome and ubiquitin conjugates simultaneously as expected if conjugates are joined to proteasomes through a Rad23 linker. In the absence of a linked UBL domain, the C-terminal domain effectively competes with proteasomes for ubiquitin conjugate binding (Fig. 1, C–E, and data not shown). In both S. cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, proteasome subunit Rpn1 docks Rad23 onto proteasomes through recognition of its UBL domain (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 11Seeger M. Hartmann-Petersen R. Wilkinson C.R.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 296: 813-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Interestingly, another proteasome-associated protein, deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6, also binds proteasomes by virtue of an interaction between its UBL domain and Rpn1 (41Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Affinity-purified proteasomes are heavily if not stoichiometrically loaded with Ubp6 (41Leggett D.S. Hanna J. Borodovsky A. Crosas B. Schmidt M. Baker R.T. Walz T. Ploegh H. Finley D. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 495-507Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Rad23 and Ubp6 may compete with each other for binding to proteasomes and that only a minor fraction of proteasomes (those lacking Ubp6) therefore may be available for conjugate docking via Rad23. To test this scenario, the binding of 32P-labeled Rad23 to immobilized proteasome was measured in the presence and absence of unlabeled Ubp6. As seen in Fig. 2, Ubp6 has no influence on Rad23 binding. Thus, although Rad23 and Ubp6 both bind proteasomes via their UBL domains, they do so through distinct binding sites on Rpn1. To confirm this conclusion, we carried out similar binding assays using GST-Rpn1 as the immobilized ligand. As seen for intact proteasomes, Rad23 and Ubp6 bound Rpn1 independently (data not shown). By simultaneously binding two UBL proteins that are active on ubiquitin chains, Rpn1 may play a critical scaffolding role in the proteasome. Previously we localized the Rad23 binding site in Rpn1 using a series of deletions constructed from a GST-Rpn1 fusion (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). When analogous experiments were carried out with Ubp6, the Rpn1 segments that had shown specific and essentially wild-type affinity for Rad23 (10Elsasser S. Gali R.R. Schwickart M. Larsen C.N. Leggett D.S. Muller B. Feng M.T. Tubing F. Dittmar G.A. Finley D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 725-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) showed little or no specific binding to Ubp6 despite the fact that the binding of Ubp6 to full-length Rpn1 is quite robust as compared with Rad23 (data not shown). These findings are in agreement with the proposal of a distinct, noncompeti"

Here we investigate the vocal behaviour in the presence and absence of whale-watcher boat traffic of three social groups (pods) of killer whales (Orcinus orca) living in the nearshore waters of Washington state. We find longer call durations in the presence of boats for all three pods, but only in recent recordings made following a period of increasing boat traffic. This result indicates that these whales adjust their behaviour to compensate for anthropogenic noise once it reaches a threshold level."
https://openalex.org/W2078840098,"The MexAB-OprM efflux pump of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is central to multidrug resistance of this organism, which infects immunocompromised hospital patients. The MexA, MexB, and OprM subunits were assumed to function as the membrane fusion protein, the body of the transporter, and the outer membrane channel protein, respectively. For better understanding of this important xenobiotic transporter, we show the x-ray crystallographic structure of MexA at a resolution of 2.40 A. The global MexA structure showed unforeseen new features with a spiral assembly of six and seven protomers that were joined together at one end by a pseudo 2-fold image. The protomer showed a new protein structure with a tandem arrangement consisting of at least three domains and presumably one more. The rod domain had a long hairpin of twisted coiled-coil that extended to one end. The second domain adjacent to the rod α-helical domain was globular and constructed by a cluster of eight short β-sheets. The third domain located distal to the α-helical rod was globular and composed of seven short β-sheets and one short α-helix. The 13-mer was shaped like a woven rattan cylinder with a large internal tubular space and widely opened flared ends. The 6-mer and 7-mer had a funnel-like structure consisting of a tubular rod at one side and a widely opened flared funnel top at the other side. Based on these results, we constructed a model of the MexAB-OprM pump assembly. The three pairs of MexA dimers interacted with the periplasmic α-barrel domain of OprM via the α-helical hairpin, the second domain interacted with both MexB and OprM at their contact site, and the third and disordered domains probably interacted with the distal domain of MexB. In this fashion, the MexA subunit connected MexB and OprM, indicating that MexA is the membrane bridge protein."
https://openalex.org/W2051537724,"Members of the DExH/D superfamily of nucleic acid–activated nucleotide triphosphatases are essential for virtually all aspects of RNA metabolism, including pre–messenger RNA splicing, RNA interference, translation, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking. Physiological substrates for these enzymes are thought to be regions of double-stranded RNA, because several DExH/D proteins catalyze strand separation in vitro. These “RNA helicases” can also disrupt RNA-protein interactions, but it is unclear whether this activity is coupled to duplex unwinding. Here we demonstrate that two unrelated DExH/D proteins catalyze protein displacement independently of duplex unwinding. Therefore, the essential functions of DExH/D proteins are not confined to RNA duplexes but can be exerted on a wide range of ribonucleoprotein substrates."

Many bacteria adhere to host extracellular matrix proteins as an essential first step toward the pathogenesis of infection (1Foster T.J. Höök M. Trends Microbiol. 1998; 6: 484-488Google Scholar). In Gram-positive bacteria, the cell wall envelope serves as a surface organelle with immobilized surface proteins that are responsible for mediating adhesion to host tissues (2Navarre W.W. Schneewind O. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 174-229Google Scholar). Many of these surface proteins are covalently linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan by a mechanism requiring a C-terminal sorting signal with the conserved LPXTG motif (where X represents any amino acid) (3Schneewind O.

Several observations suggest that lipid II, a membrane anchored intermediate of cell wall synthesis, functions as the peptidoglycan substrate of sortase A (10Perry A.M. Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K.

Because of the central role of sortases in the functional assembly of the cell wall envelope and in bacterial pathogenicity, sortases have been acknowledged as a target for the development of therapeutic agents that may disrupt human infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria (27Cossart P. Jonquieres R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5013-5015Google Scholar). A single conserved cysteine (Cys184) in SrtA is absolutely essential for its activity (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar). Substitution of Cys184 with Ala or addition of cysteine reactive reagents such as methyl methane-thiosulfonate and p-hydroxymercury benzoate abolish the activity of the enzyme, suggesting that SrtA is a cysteine protease (6Ton-That H.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar). The cleavage of the LPXTG motif between the threonine (T) and glycine (G) residues by SrtA leads to the formation of a covalent thioester bond between the thiol group of the enzyme cysteine and the carboxyl group of the substrate threonine residue, and this transient acyl-enzyme intermediate is subsequently resolved by the nucleophilic attack of the amino group of pentaglycyl (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar, 13Kruger R.G. Otvos B. Frankel B.A. Bentley M. Dostal P. McCafferty D.G. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 1541-1551Google Scholar). A new amide bond is then formed between the threonine and the N-terminal glycine residue of the peptidoglycan, resulting in a substrate protein covalently linked to the peptidoglycan (8Schneewind O. Fowler A. Faull K.F. Science. 1995; 268: 103-106Google Scholar). SrtAΔN59, a recombinant sortase A lacking the N-terminal 59 residues, is fully functional in vitro and catalyzes the cleavage of peptides bearing an LPXTG motif as well as the transpeptidation reaction with pentaglycine substrate (29Ton-That H. Mazmanian H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Google Scholar, 31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar). Previous determination of the three-dimensional structure of SrtAΔN59 using NMR revealed three residues, Cys184 together with His120 and Asn98, arranged in a disposition similar to that of the catalytic triad observed in classic cysteine proteases such as papain (31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar). Because a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair is structurally and functionally conserved among the superfamily of cysteine proteases, proximally positioned Cys184 and His120 residues in SrtA were thought to act as the catalytic ion pair (30Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar, 31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar). However, the thiol group of Cys184 was seen pointing away from the imidazole ring of His120 and the distance between the two side chains was much farther than that observed in a typical catalytic cysteine-histidine ion pair. In addition, the side chain of His120, deeply buried under a hydrophobic cluster, may not be accessible to a potential substrate. A recent study estimated the pKa of the active site Cys184 thiol and His120 imidazole ring to be around 9.4 and 7.0, respectively, suggesting that SrtA does not form a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair in its active site (32Connolly K.M. Smith B.T. Pilpa R. Ilangovan U. Jung M.E. Clubb R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34061-34065Google Scholar). Hence, neither the actual disposition of the active site nor the catalytic apparatus of SrtA is perfectly understood. In addition, the crystal structure of S. aureus sortase B, a cysteine transpeptidase responsible for anchoring surface proteins with C-terminal NPQTN sorting motifs to the cell wall, had raised the possibility of sortases utilizing a Cys-Arg catalytic dyad for catalysis. However, these studies left unresolved the details of the substrate binding pocket that may enable S. aureus sortases to distinguish between LPETG and NPQTN sorting signals (33Zong Y. Mazmanian S.K. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 105-112Google Scholar). Herein we sought to characterize the substrate binding pocket and the catalytic mechanism of sortase A by determining the three-dimensional crystal structures of SrtAΔN59, its active site mutant (C184A) SrtAΔN59, where we mutated the active nucleophilic residue Cys184 to an alanine, and a complex of the mutant and its peptide substrate (SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala + LPETG peptide). Furthermore, by comparing S. aureus SrtAΔN59 and sortase B crystal structures (33Zong Y. Mazmanian S.K. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 105-112Google Scholar), we sought to define the substrate binding pocket of both sortases and their catalytic apparatus, and propose a catalytic mechanism that may be universal for sortases. Protein Purification and Crystallization—The recombinant enzyme SrtAΔN59 and its variant C184A were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar). The truncation of the N-terminal 59 amino acids did not affect the activity of the enzyme (29Ton-That H. Mazmanian H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Google Scholar, 31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar), but enhanced the solubility and helped the crystallization. All crystals were grown by the hanging-drop technique with a protein concentration of 50 mg/ml in 25 mm MES, 1The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; r.m.s., root mean square. pH 6.35. The crystallization condition includes 3.2 m ammonium sulfate, 0.1 m NaCl, and trace amounts of ethylene glycol. A single SrtAΔN59 crystal was obtained after 4 weeks. The recombinant SrtAΔN59 enzyme was confirmed to be active at crystallization, pH 6.35 (data not shown). The crystal was harvested and ground in its crystallization solution to be used for later seeding. All other crystals, including SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala, were obtained by the micro-seeding technique. Selenomethoinine-substituted SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala was expressed using an established protocol (35Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Google Scholar), and the corresponding crystals were obtained by microseeding with unlabeled SrtAΔN59 crystals to perform a selenium MAD phasing experiment. High performance liquid chromatography purified LPETG peptide was obtained from the University of Alabama core peptide synthesis facility. The SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala-peptide complex crystals were obtained by soaking the peptide into the crystals under similar crystallization conditions. X-ray Diffraction Data Collection—Some native SrtAΔN59 diffraction data were recorded using in-house x-ray radiation, equipped with a RAXIS-IV detector. Diffraction data to 2.3-Å resolution were collected using Seleno-Met crystals of SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala at 100 K on the X4-A beamline of NSLS. Standard three wavelength selenium MAD data were collected and processed with HKL2000 and the SCALEPACK suit of programs (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326PubMed Google Scholar). A complete diffraction data set for the SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala-LPETG complex was also collected at 100 K using the APS 19BM beamline. However, the crystal structure of SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala was determined by the single wavelength anomalous dispersion method using only the “peak data” collected at 0.9792 Å. Identification of selenium atom positions, refinement, and subsequent phasing were done with the help of CNS and SOLVE programs (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The crystal structure of SrtAΔN59 was determined by molecular replacement methods. Model building was performed with the help of the “O” program (38Jones T. Bergdoll M. Kjeldgaard M. Ealick S. Crystallographic and Modeling Methods in Molecular Design. Springer Verlag, New York1990: 189-195Google Scholar) and refined with the help of CNS.

Open table in a new tab Structure of SrtAΔN59—The crystals of SrtAΔN59 and SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala belong to the P21 space group and there are 3 molecules (A, B, and C) in the crystallographic asymmetric unit. We were unsuccessful in solving the SrtAΔN59 crystal structure by molecular replacement methods using the NMR structures (Protein Data Bank code 1IJA) as starting models. Although 3-wavelength selenium MAD phasing data on a seleno-Met SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala crystal were collected, because of unexpected scaling problems between the three data sets, the single wavelength anomalous dispersion phasing technique was utilized to solve the crystal structure by using the peak wavelength data alone. A total of 6 sites of selenium were found using the CNS program (2 sites for each molecule) (37Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The electron density map, calculated to 2.3 Å, was readily interpretable once density modification procedures were completed. In addition to the SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala crystal structure, the crystal structures of native SrtAΔN59 and the SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala + LPETG peptide complex were determined by molecular replacement methods and refined to 2.0- and 1.7-Å resolutions, respectively. The core of the SrtAΔN59 crystal structure is an 8-strand β-barrel. One α helix and two 3-turn helices connect the β strands, forming a novel -fold (Fig. 1). A DALI search confirmed the absence of homologues proteins in the protein data bank. The three molecules (A, B, and C) present in the asymmetric unit are not related by any identifiable non-crystallographic symmetry. Two N-terminal residues in molecule A, 4 in B, and 3 in C have no electron density in 2Fo – Fc maps, indicating N-terminal flexibility. The r.m.s. deviations between molecules A, B, and C are less than 0.57 Å. The major difference among the three molecules is in the conformations of the loop connecting the β6 and β7 strands (depicted in red color, Fig. 1). One side of the β-barrel, formed by the β4, β7, and β8 strands, is concave in appearance and, along with three of the surrounding loops, forms a tunnel-like hydrophobic pocket in the center of which the catalytic Cys184 is located. The side chain of Cys184 is pointed out into the open region. However, access to this pocket is blocked in the case of molecules B and C by the loop regions of symmetry related molecules, whereas the hydrophobic pocket of the active site Cys residue in molecule A has clear access from the solvent. Superimposition of the SrtAΔN59 crystal structure with one of its NMR counterparts indicates that the core β-barrel structure seems to be subtly different, with an r.m.s. deviation of ∼1.95 Å for all the Cα atoms. These observations may explain our failure to phase the diffraction data by molecular replacement methods using NMR structures as search models. Not surprisingly, many differences are also seen in the side chain conformations between the crystal and NMR structures in the core region as well as in peripheral regions of the molecule, and these differences may be an indication of the low resolution nature of NMR structures. Comparison with Other Cysteine Proteases—The SrtA from S. aureus was the first cysteine transpeptidase to be identified (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar). The initial steps in the transpeptidation reaction include the cleavage of the scissile bond of a substrate and the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate, steps that are very similar to those seen in reactions catalyzed by all cysteine proteases (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar, 30Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar). Comparison of SrtA with other cysteine proteases would benefit our understanding of the mechanism of this enzyme. Cys184 and His120 are absolutely conserved in all sortase enzymes and were shown to be essential for SrtA catalysis (30Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar, 31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar). These observations provide the basis for a mechanistic model whereby SrtA may utilize a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair for function (30Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar). A third residue, Trp194, was also implicated in assisting in the formation of a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair (30Ton-That H. Mazmanian S.K. Alksne L. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7447-7452Google Scholar). When examined for the papain superfamily proteases, the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues are typically positioned on loops at the ends of a β-strand and an α helix, respectively, and are located in two separate domains (40Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Google Scholar, 41Kamphuis I.G. Kalk K.H. Swarte M.B. Drenth J. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 233-256Google Scholar). The substrate-binding site is a cleft between the two domains. Both catalytic residues, Cys25 and His295, of papain are well exposed into the cleft and capable of accessing the scissile amide bond, whereas the amide nitrogen of the catalytic Cys25 and a neighboring residue Gln19 side chain cooperate to function as the “oxyanion hole” and stabilize the acylated intermediate (Fig. 2A). In the crystal structure of SrtAΔN59, Cys184 and His120 are anchored on two neighboring β-strands of a concave β-sheet, which inherently lacks flexibility (Fig. 2B). However, the geometric disposition of the putative catalytic residues, Cys, His, and Asn/Asp residues between papain, sortase A, and sortase B (Fig. 2C), is similar (31Ilangovan U. Ton-That H. Iwahara J. Schneewind O. Clubb R.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6056-6061Google Scholar, 33Zong Y. Mazmanian S.K. Schneewind O. Narayana S.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 105-112Google Scholar). Unlike papain, the thiol group of Cys184 in SrtAΔN59 is positioned 7 Å away from the imidazole ring of His120, and this distance could not be shortened to less than 4.8 Å even if the closest rotamers for both residues were chosen. Short of a substantial structural rearrangement, Cys184 and His120 could not be positioned in close proximity to form a Cys-His ion pair. Additional support for the notion that a Cys-His ion pair may not be formed in the active site was obtained by the recent pKa measurements of the active site Cys184 thiol and His120 imidazole ring to be around 9.4 and 7.0, respectively (32Connolly K.M. Smith B.T. Pilpa R. Ilangovan U. Jung M.E. Clubb R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34061-34065Google Scholar). In conventional cysteine and serine proteases, the catalytic histidine residue plays an important role in facilitating the highly reactive nucleophilic Cys/Ser attack by protonating the amide atom of the substrate scissile bond (42Harrison M.J. Burton N.A. Hillier I.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12285-12291Google Scholar, 43Storer A.C. Menard R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 486-500Google Scholar). However, in some special cases, other ionizable residues such as lysine and tyrosine are known to assume this role (44Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Google Scholar, 45Silvaggi N.R. Anderson J.W. Brinsmade S.R. Pratt R.F. Kelly J.A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1199-1208Google Scholar). Close inspection of the active site Cys184 residue surroundings in the SrtAΔN59 crystal structure revealed several ionizable groups in addition to His120. For example, in a radius of 12 Å, polar and charged residues Thr183, Asp185, Lys196, Arg197, Glu105, Ser116, Thr180, and Try187 can be observed. Among them, the residues Arg197 (6.7 Å), Glu105 (11.6 Å), Ser116 (10.0 Å), Thr180 (10.5 Å), and Tyr187 (10.2 Å) are on the Cys184 side of the β sheet, whereas others are pointing either into the β-sandwich core or away to the solvent region. Under conditions of substrate binding and within a scenario where only residue side chain movement was allowed (considering that the putative catalytic residues are anchored onto β-strands within a rigid β-sheet), we could identify a single ionizable group, i.e. the side chain guanidino group of Arg197, that could be moved in proximity of Cys184 (∼3.5 Å) to form a catalytic ion pair (42Harrison M.J. Burton N.A. Hillier I.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 12285-12291Google Scholar). The Complex Structure of SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala + Peptide—Recombinant SrtAΔN59 and full-length SrtA were shown to cleave LPETG-bearing peptides with equal efficiency in vitro (6Ton-That H. Liu G. Mazmanian S.K. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12424-12429Google Scholar). The co-crystallization of wild type SrtAΔN59 and LPETG peptide was not entirely successful, only broken and patchy electron density around the thiol group of Cys184 was found in 2Fo – Fc and Fo – Fc electron density maps. Our failure to observe the complete acyl-enzyme intermediate (covalently bound LPET peptide adduct) could be because of the high concentration of ammonium sulfate (3.25 m) used during crystallization and the possible existence of ammonium ions acting as a nucleophile to release the bound peptide adduct. It also could be because of the slow hydrolysis of the peptide adduct, as sortase has been shown to catalyze a hydrolysis reaction in vitro even in the absence of the peptidoglycan nucleophile albeit very slowly (29Ton-That H. Mazmanian H. Faull K.F. Schneewind O. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9876-9881Google Scholar, 46Huang X. Aulabaugh A. Ding W. Kapoor B. Alksne L. Tabei K. Ellestad G. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11307-11315Google Scholar). LPETG peptide was diffused overnight into the crystals of SrtAΔN59Cys184Ala, an active site mutant whose crystals are isomorphous with those of SrtAΔN59. Clear electron density was observed extending along the concave β sheet in the proximity of C184A in the active site of molecule C in the asymmetric unit (Fig. 3A), but no such density was observed for molecules A and B. This discrepancy is mainly because of crystal-packing arrangements, as the peptide-binding sites of molecule A and B are blocked by the neighboring loop segments of the molecule. The peptide-binding site, seen in a surface plot (Fig. 3C), is in a deep cleft region flanked by two loops. The N-terminal part of the peptide is positioned toward the entrance of the cleft, whereas its C-terminal end resides close to the C184A (Fig. 3B). The conserved Leu and Pro residues of the ligand peptide (4Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Google Scholar) have settled in the highly hydrophobic surroundings formed by the residues present on the floor of the concave β sheet and the two contributing loop segments. The side chain of the least conserved third residue in the LPXTG motif, the Glu residue of the substrate (4Mazmanian S.K. Liu G. Ton-That H. Schneewind O. Science. 1999; 285: 760-763Google Scholar), is observed pointing outwards into the solvent. Most significantly, the scissile peptide bond between the C-terminal Thr and Gly residues of the ligand peptide is suitably positioned between C184A and Arg197, far from the His120 side chain. Interestingly, the carbonyl oxygen of Thr is pointing toward the Arg197 guanidino group N-ϵ atom, and the separation between them, much shorter for hydrogen bonding distance,"
https://openalex.org/W1974514111,"Mating with more than one male is the norm for females of many species. In addition to generating competition between the ejaculates of different males1,2, multiple mating may allow females to bias sperm use3,4. In Drosophila melanogaster, the last male to inseminate a female sires approximately 80% of subsequent progeny5. Both sperm displacement, where resident sperm are removed from storage by the incoming ejaculate of the copulating male6, and sperm incapacitation, where incoming seminal fluids supposedly interfere with resident sperm7, have been implicated in this pattern of sperm use5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12. But the idea of incapacitation is problematic because there are no known mechanisms by which an individual could damage rival sperm and not their own. Females also influence the process of sperm use13,14, but exactly how is unclear. Here we show that seminal fluids do not kill rival sperm and that any ‘incapacitation’ is probably due to sperm ageing during sperm storage. We also show that females release stored sperm from the reproductive tract (sperm dumping) after copulation with a second male and that this requires neither incoming sperm nor seminal fluids. Instead, males may cause stored sperm to be dumped or females may differentially eject sperm from the previous mating."

Our analysis of field data collected between 1955 and 1996 shows that plague invades, fades out, and reinvades in response to fluctuations in the abundance of its main reservoir host, the great gerbil (Rhombomys opimus). This is a rare empirical example of the two types of abundance thresholds for infectious disease-invasion and persistence- operating in a single wildlife population. We parameterized predictive models that should reduce the costs of plague surveillance in central Asia and thereby encourage its continuance."

There is increasing evidence that the retrograde transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 along sensory axons is mediated by cytoplasmic dynein, but the viral and cellular proteins involved are not known.

After 1 h VP26+ capsids were observed to co-localize with RP3, Tctex1, and microtubules. After 2 or 4 h VP26+ capsids had moved closer to the cell nucleus, whereas VP26-capsids remained in a random distribution.

After inoculation of the skin or mucous membrane, HSV-1 is transported along sensory axons in a retrograde direction to the neuronal cell body, where it establishes life-long latent infection. Periodic reactivation results in HSV-1 being transported in an anterograde direction to nerve terminals, where it causes recurrent clinical disease or asymptomatic viral shedding (1Roizman B. Sears A.E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Chanock R.M. Melnick J.L. Monath T.P. Roizman B. Straus S.E. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia, PA1996: 2231-2294Google Scholar). The double-stranded DNA virus HSV-1 has a 1250-Å icosahedral protein capsid, surrounded by a less structured protein tegument layer, in turn surrounded by a lipid envelope containing several glycoproteins. The major capsid proteins VP5, VP19C, VP23, and VP26 are self-assembling when expressed in vitro using recombinant baculoviruses (2Tatman J.D. Preston V.G. Nicholson P. Elliott R.M. Rixon F.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1101-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 3Thomsen D.R. Roof L.L. Homa F.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2442-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During infection, HSV-1 binds to cell surface receptors (via glycoproteins), enters the cell by membrane fusion, then most but not all tegument proteins dissociate from the nucleocapsid after phosphorylation (4Morrison E.E. Stevenson A.J. Wang Y.F. Meredith D.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 2517-2528Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 5Morrison E.E. Wang Y.F. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 7108-7114Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The nucleocapsid-tegument complex is transported to the outer nuclear membrane where it docks and releases viral DNA into the nucleus, but the capsid itself does not enter the nucleus (6Ojala P.M. Sodeik B. Ebersold M.W. Kutay U. Helenius A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4922-4931Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). There is evidence that the rapid “retrograde” transport of this complex to the cell nucleus involves microtubules and is mediated by the minus-end-directed molecular motor cytoplasmic dynein (7Sodeik B. Ebersold M.W. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1007-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 8Dohner K. Wolfstein A. Prank U. Echeverri C. Dujardin D. Vallee R. Sodeik B. Mol. Biol.

Virol. 1984; 65: 55-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Retrograde transport of the closely related alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) has been observed in live cells to be saltatory, with brief, rapid transport events (10Tomishima M.J. Smith G.A. Enquist L.W. Traffic. 2001; 2: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The herpes viral proteins that mediate retrograde transport are unknown but are likely to involve outer capsid or inner tegument proteins. In support of this, HSV-1 capsids, stripped of envelope and much of the tegument protein by detergent lysis, move in a retrograde direction after injection into giant squid axons (11Bearer E.L. Breakefield X.O. Schuback D. Reese T.S. LaVail J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8146-8150Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The site of attachment for the dynein complex on the capsid has not been confirmed. Cytoplasmic dynein is a large (1.2 MDa) complex, with heavy chains providing motive force, whereas intermediate and light chains contribute to cargo binding (12King S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 60-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Regulation of dynein function is not well understood but is thought to involve the multisubunit complex dynactin, which is also involved in binding membranous cargo (13Holleran E.A. Karki S. Holzbaur E.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1998; 182: 69-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Light chain LC8 has been reported to interact with proteins from rabies virus (14Raux H. Flamand A. Blondel D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10212-10216Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 15Jacob Y. Badrane H. Ceccaldi P.E. Tordo N. J.

Roncal F. Albar J.P. Alonso C. Gavilanes F. Rodriguez-Crespo I. FEBS Lett. 2003; 544: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), whereas Tctex1 interacts with the poliovirus receptor CD155 (18Mueller S. Cao X. Welker R. Wimmer E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7897-7904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Despite a recently reported interaction between dynein intermediate chain (DIC) and HSV-1 protein UL34 (19Ye G.J. Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. Roizman B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1355-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), its role in retrograde transport has yet to be confirmed. The protein product of UL34 is absent from mature virions in HSV-1 (20Reynolds A.E. Wills E.G. Roller R.J. Ryckman B.J. Baines J.D. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 8939-8952Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) and PRV (21Klupp B.G. Granzow H. Mettenleiter T.C. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10063-10073Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of UL34 from HSV-1 does not prevent infection of cells (22Roller R.J. Zhou Y. Schnetzer R. Ferguson J. DeSalvo D. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has concentrated on anterograde axonal transport of HSV-1. We have shown that newly formed HSV-1 capsids, having acquired much of their tegument in the neuron cell body (23Miranda-Saksena M. Boadle R.A. Armati P. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9934-9951Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), are transported in an anterograde direction along axons, separate from glycoproteins (24Holland D.J. Miranda-Saksena M. Boadle R.A. Armati P. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8503-8511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Miranda-Saksena M. Armati P. Boadle R.A. Holland D.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1827-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Similar observations have been made for PRV (26Enquist L.W. Tomishima M.J. Gross S. Smith G.A. Vet. Microbiol. 2002; 86: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Fast anterograde, microtubule-dependent transport is mediated by the kinesin family of molecular motors (27Goldstein L.S. Yang Z. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 23: 39-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We have shown previously (28Diefenbach R.J. Miranda-Saksena M. Diefenbach E. Holland D.J. Boadle R.A. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) that the HSV-1 tegument protein US11 interacts with the ubiquitous heavy chain of the kinesin motor KIF5B and is likely to play an important role in anterograde axonal transport. By using a similar approach for retrograde transport, we report an interaction between the HSV-1 capsid protein VP26 and 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1. These light chains are 55% homologous at the amino acid level and are mutually exclusive in cytoplasmic dynein complexes (29Chuang J.Z. Milner T.A. Sung C.H. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 5501-5512Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 153: 1499-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). We propose that VP26 mediates binding of the HSV-1 nucleocapsid to cytoplasmic dynein, via interactions with RP3 and probably Tctex1, during retrograde axonal transport of virus in neurons as well as during infection of non-neuronal cells. Expression Constructs—Genes were amplified by PCR using Geneamp® XL PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). The entire open reading frame for each gene was cloned into recombinant expression vectors in all cases except for HSV-1 UL36, where the N-terminal two-thirds of the gene (amino acids 1–1874) were cloned. Oligonucleotide primers, incorporating EcoRI and/or XhoI restriction endonuclease sites for most constructs, were designed using Primer3 software (32Rozen S. Skaletsky H.J. Krawetz S. Misener S. Bioinformatics Methods and Protocols: Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 365-386Google Scholar) and BioManager by ANGIS (www.angis.org.au). For UL36 a 3′ BglII site was used for insertion into BamHI sites, and for UL32 NcoI sites were used. Human DIC-1c was amplified from a pBluescript plasmid, kindly provided by Dr. Lap-Chee Tsui, University of Toronto (34Crackower M.A. Sinasac D.S. Xia J. Motoyama J. Prochazka M. Rommens J.M. Scherer S.W. Tsui L.C. Genomics. 1999; 55: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Genes for dynein light chains Tctex1, RP3, and LC8 were amplified from human brain cDNA library (Display Biosystems Biotech). HSV-1 genes were amplified from overlapping DNA cosmids encoding strain 17 (35Cunningham C. Davison A.J. Virology. 1993; 197: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), except for US11 which was amplified from plasmid pRB4766 (strain 17), kindly provided by Bernard Roizman, University of Chicago (36Cassady K.A. Gross M. Roizman B. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 8620-8626Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). UL19 was excised from plasmid pE19 (33Nicholson P. Addison C. Cross A.M. Kennard J. Preston V.G. Rixon F.J. J. Gen. Virol. 1994; 75: 1091-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) with BglII and inserted into a BamHI site. Digested PCR products were inserted into expression plasmids using a Clonables™ kit (Novagen). Genes were cloned into pGEX-5X-1 (Amersham Biosciences) for glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag fusion protein expression or pET-28a (Novagen) for hexahistidine (His6) tag fusion protein expression. For the LexA yeast two-hybrid system genes were cloned into displayBait and/or displayTarget vectors (Display Systems Biotech). All constructs were sequenced to confirm gene sequence and correct reading frame. Construction of His6 tag fusions of kinesin heavy chain KIF5B (amino acids 771–963) (37Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and HSV-1 US11 (28Diefenbach R.J. Miranda-Saksena M. Diefenbach E. Holland D.J. Boadle R.A. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 3282-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) have been described previously. LexA Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—Potential interactions between dynein subunits and HSV-1 proteins were tested in a Clontech Matchmaker LexA yeast two-hybrid system as described previously (38Diefenbach R.J. Diefenbach E. Douglas M.W. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of His6-tagged Proteins—His6 tag constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), induced with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. Proteins were harvested and lysed as described previously (38Diefenbach R.J. Diefenbach E. Douglas M.W. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). His-VP11/12 was expressed as a soluble protein at low levels, whereas His6-VP26 was insoluble (i.e. present only as inclusion bodies). His6-KIF5B was purified as described previously (38Diefenbach R.J. Diefenbach E. Douglas M.W. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To solubilize His6-VP26, inclusion bodies were resuspended in “denaturing buffer” (8 m urea, 100 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 0.5 mm imidazole at 4 °C. After 1 h the solution was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min, then the supernatant for a further 10 min. Supernatant was passed over nickel beads (His.Bind® kit, Novagen); the beads were washed with denaturing buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, and then His6-VP26 was eluted into denaturing buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Fractions with the highest protein concentration (∼5 mg/ml) were pooled and stored at 4 °C. To refold His6-VP26, 200 μl of stock His6-VP26 solution (in 8 m urea) was slowly diluted 1:8 (in buffer containing 100 mm NaH2PO4 and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) to a final urea concentration of 1 m. In Vitro Pull-down Assays—GST fusion tag constructs were expressed in E. coli BL21, induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C, then harvested, and lysed as described previously (38Diefenbach R.J. Diefenbach E. Douglas M.W. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14906-14915Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Soluble bacterial lysates (1 ml) containing GST fusion proteins were incubated with 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 3 h with rocking at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer (minus protease inhibitors) before addition of purified His6 tag fusion proteins or HSV-1 capsids. Beads were incubated overnight at 4 °C with rocking before washing five times as above. Protein complexes were eluted into buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm reduced glutathione) with rocking at 4 °C for 2 h. For pull-down assays of dynein complexes, refolded His6-VP26 (prepared as above) was bound to nickel beads (His.Bind® kit, Novagen) and incubated with cell lysates; then bound complexes were eluted as described previously (37Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared from Hep2 cells grown to 80% confluence. Cells were detached with trypsin, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and then resuspended in lysis buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cells were subjected to sonication in a cup-horn water bath (three times for 20 s, 100% duty cycle) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Western Blots—Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and identified by immunoblotting as described previously (37Diefenbach R.J. Mackay J.P. Armati P.J. Cunningham A.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16663-16670Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Antibodies used included mouse monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) against fusion tags hemagglutinin, LexA, and His6. Monoclonal antibody against DIC (Chemicon) was also used. Preparation of Recombinant HSV-1 Capsids—Recombinant HSV-1 capsids were prepared as described previously (3Thomsen D.R. Roof L.L. Homa F.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2442-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant baculoviruses were used to express either five or six HSV-1 capsid genes (UL18, UL19, UL26, UL26.5, and UL38, with or without UL35) in insect Sf9 cells. The resulting capsids, purified by sucrose gradient centrifugation, have the same morphology as HSV B capsids (3Thomsen D.R. Roof L.L. Homa F.L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2442-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Trus B.L. Homa F.L. Booy F.P. Newcomb W.W. Thomsen D.R. Cheng N. Brown J.C. Steven A.C. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7362-7366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All recombinant capsids contain major capsid proteins VP5, VP19C, and VP23 and scaffolding proteins VP21, VP22a, and VP24. Capsids formed in the presence of UL35 also contain capsid protein VP26. For microinjection, capsids were diluted 1:10 in 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA, subjected to sonication in a cup-horn water bath (three times for 40 s, 50% duty cycle), and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 s. The approximate final protein concentration, measured by Bio-Rad Protein Assay, was 0.1 mg/ml. Microinjection of Recombinant HSV-1 Capsids—Hep2 cells were grown at 37 °C (5% CO2) on CELLocate glass coverslips (Eppendorf) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 9% fetal calf serum (JRH Bioscience). Microinjection was performed at room temperature, using Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 2% fetal calf serum, buffered with 25 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.4. For co-localization experiments PTK2 cells were grown in minimum Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with nonessential amino acids (0.1 mm), sodium pyruvate (1 mm), and 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences). An Eppendorf FemtoJet® microinjector and InjectMan® NI2 micromanipulator, attached to a Nikon DM-IRB inverted microscope, were used to inject recombinant HSV-1 capsids through a Femtotip® glass micropipette into Hep2 or PTK2 cells. The injection parameters used are as follows: compensation pressure, 50 hPa; injection pressure, 280–300 hPa (range 200–400 hPa); injection time, 0.2–0.4 s. Between 200 and 400 cells were injected for each experimental group or time point. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—Microinjected Hep2 cells were fixed and permeabilized as described previously (25Miranda-Saksena M. Armati P. Boadle R.A. Holland D.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1827-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), either immediately or after 2–4 h of incubation at 37 °C. Sensitive and specific labeling of intra-cytoplasmic capsids was obtained with rabbit polyclonal anti-VP5 antibody (NC1, kindly provided by Dr. G. Cohen and Dr. R. Eisenberg, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia (40Cohen G.H. Ponce D.L. Diggelmann H. Lawrence W.C. Vernon S.K. Eisenberg R.J. J. Virol. 1980; 34: 521-531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). Some nonspecific labeling of antigens within the nucleus was observed but did not involve the nuclear membrane or cytoplasm. Mouse anti-bovine α-tubulin antibody (monoclonal antibody 236-10501, Molecular Probes) was used to label microtubules. Immunolabeling was as described previously (25Miranda-Saksena M. Armati P. Boadle R.A. Holland D.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1827-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), except antibodies were diluted in Tris-buffered saline with goat serum (1.5% v/v), bovine serum albumin (0.1% w/v), Tween 20 (0.05% v/v), and NaNH3 (0.02 m). Secondary antibodies were Cy™ 3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) and Alexa Fluor® 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes). For co-localization experiments, microinjected PTK2 cells were incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, fixed, and permeabilized (25Miranda-Saksena M. Armati P. Boadle R.A. Holland D.J. Cunningham A.L. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 1827-1839Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Dynein light chains were detected with rabbit polyclonal antibodies (a kind gift of Dr. Stephen King, University of Connecticut Health Centre, Farmington, CT). Primary antibody R5270 against RP3 (30King S.M. Barbarese E. Dillman III, J.F. Benashski S.E. Do K.T. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15033-15041Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) or R5205 against Tctex1 (41King S.M. Dillman III, J.F. Benashski S.E. Lye R.J. Patel-King R.S. Pfister K.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32281-32287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) was used as above, followed by Cy™ 3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Biosciences). Microtubules were labeled as above. Capsids were detected using anti-VP5 antibodies, either rabbit polyclonal (NC1, as above) or mouse monoclonal antibody (DM165, raised against purified VP5) (42McClelland D.A. Aitken J.D. Bhella D. McNab D. Mitchell J. Kelly S.M. Price N.C. Rixon F.J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 7407-7417Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Confocal images were acquired using a Leica TCS SP2 Confocal System (software version 2.00 Build 0871), attached to a Leica DMRE microscope. Dual-channel images were overlaid using the Leica software, and co-localization was determined using the Boolean “AND” operator. For a red/green overlay, where a red and green pixel colocalize, a bright pixel is displayed; where pixels do not co-localize, a black pixel is displayed. Measurement of Intracellular Distribution of Capsids—To assess quantitatively the distribution of microinjected capsids, the distances of each fluorescent particle from the cell nucleus a, and the nearest part of the cell membrane b, were measured with the aid of image analysis software (ImageJ version 1.29, National Institutes of Health). A “Nuclear Migration Index” b/(a + b) was calculated for each particle, such that particles near the cell periphery had values close to 0, whereas particles near the nucleus had values close to 1 (43McDonald D. Vodicka M.A. Lucero G. Svitkina T.M. Borisy G.G. Emerman M. Hope T.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Image analysis was performed “blinded” to remove potential observer bias. Fluorescent particles were confirmed to be within the cytoplasm, rather than sitting on the cell membrane, using serial z sections. In areas where several fluorescent particles congregated, individual particles were visually separated by image analysis using threshold functions or z sections. Statistical Analysis—The statistical software package SPSS for Windows (version 11.0) was used to analyze the data. For comparison of quantitative β-galactosidase activity in the yeast two-hybrid system, analysis of variance was performed. Tukey's correction for multiple comparisons was then used to investigate pairwise differences between Target (dynein) inserts for each Bait (HSV) insert. To investigate formally intracellular movement of capsids in microinjection experiments, general linear models were used, with experiment as a random effect and time and VP26 status as fixed effects. VP26 and VP11/12 Bind to RP3 and Tctex1 in the Yeast Two-hybrid System—A yeast two-hybrid matrix approach was used to screen for interactions between HSV-1 capsid or tegument proteins and cytoplasmic dynein. Genes for dynein subunits DIC, LC8, RP3, and Tctex1, as well as for HSV-1 capsid and tegument proteins, were cloned into both Bait vector (fusion construct with LexA DNA binding domain), and Target vector (fusion construct with B42 DNA activation domain). The proteins were tested pairwise for interactions in all available combinations. A strong interaction was indicated by both growth on media lacking leucine and a blue color change of yeast colonies within 48 h. Interactions were further confirmed with a quantitative β-galactosidase assay. Known interactions between DIC and dynein light chains (31Tai A.W. Chuang J.Z. Sung C.H. J.

The symbols used are as follows: +, 10–50; ++, 20–300; +++, 300–1000; ++++, >1000; -, no color change at 48 h; (-), no color change but protein was poorly expressed; AA, strong auto-activation at 48 h; ND, not determined due to autoactivation; (-)ve, display Target with no protein insert.BaitTarget(–)veDICLC8RP3Tctex1UL6UL38DIC––+++++++++++––LC8–++++++––––US11–––––UL6–––––UL13(–)(–)(–)(–)(–)UL17AANDNDNDNDNDNDUL18 (VP23)––––––+++UL19 (VP5)(–)(–)(–)(–)(–)(–)(–)UL25AANDNDNDNDNDNDUL32AANDNDNDNDNDNDUL35 (VP26)–+++++++++++–UL36aUL36 amino acids 1–1874 (VP1/2)–––––UL37–––––UL38 (VP19C)AANDNDNDNDNDNDUL41 (VHS)–––––UL46 (VP11/12)–++++++++++++–UL47 (VP13/14)–––––UL48 (VP16)AANDNDNDNDNDNDa UL36 amino acids 1–1874 Open table in a new tab With HSV-1 proteins in Bait vector a strong interaction was detected between VP26 (UL35) and VP11/12 (UL46) with homologous 14-kDa dynein light chains RP3 and Tctex1 (Table I). β-Galactosidase activity for each protein interaction was measured using a quantitative assay and statistically examined using analysis of variance (Fig. 1). β-Galactosidase activity was significantly greater for interactions with RP3 or Tctex1 than for DIC (p < 0.05), LC8 (p < 0.004), or the negative control (p < 0.003). The apparent small increase for interactions with DIC and LC8 was not statistically significant. The known interaction between HSV-1 capsid proteins VP23 and VP19C (46Desai P. Person S. Virology. 1996; 220: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was confirmed in our system. With dynein subunits in Bait vector, RP3 and Tctex1 strongly auto-activated, so they could not be tested further. No interactions were detected between DIC or LC8 in Bait vector and any of the HSV-1 proteins tested in Target vector (data not shown). The previously reported interaction between DIC and UL34 could not be confirmed because UL34 was poorly expressed when inserted in Target vector. His6-VP26 Binds to GST-RP3 and GST-Tctex1 in Vitro—His6 fusion constructs of HSV-1 proteins VP26 and VP11/12 were expressed in E. coli. His6-VP26 formed insoluble inclusion bodies, which were solubilized by denaturing with 8 m urea and then slowly refolded by dilution to 1 m urea. VP26 expressed in bacteria, denatured, and then refolded has been shown previously to bind to HSV-1 capsids, in either CHAPS buffer or 1 m urea (47.Macnab-Bain, S. J.

ANP activities are mediated by a single span transmembrane receptor carrying intrinsic guanylate cyclase activity. ANP binding to its extracellular domain stimulates guanylate cyclase activity by an as yet unknown mechanism. Here we report the crystal structure of dimerized extracellular hormone-binding domain in complex with ANP. The structural comparison with the unliganded receptor reveals that hormone binding causes the two receptor monomers to undergo an intermolecular twist with little intramolecular conformational change. This motion produces a Ferris wheel-like translocation of two juxtamembrane domains in the dimer with essentially no change in the interdomain distance. This movement alters the relative orientation of the two domains by a shift equivalent to counterclockwise rotation of each by 24°. These results suggest that transmembrane signaling by the ANP receptor is initiated via a hormone-induced rotation mechanism.

ANP stimulates salt excretion (1de Bold A.J. Borenstein H.B. Veress A.T. Sonnenberg H. Life Sci. 1981; 28: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (2650) Google Scholar) and dilates arterial vessels (2Currie M.G. Geller D.M. Cole B.R. Boylan J.G. YuSheng W. Holmberg S.W. Needleman P.

Transgenic animals devoid of the ANP gene develop salt-sensitive hypertension (4John S.W. Krege J.H. Oliver P.M. Hagaman J.R. Hodgin J.B. Pang S.C. Flynn T.G. Smithies O. Science. 1995; 267: 679-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar), and those lacking the ANP receptor gene develop salt-insensitive essential hypertension accompanied by severe cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dilatation (5Oliver P.M. Fox J.E. Kim R. Rockman H.A. Kim H.S. Reddick R.L. Pandey K.N. Milgram S.L. Smithies O. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14730-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), implicating the ANP and ANP receptor systems in cardiovascular pathophysiology. An analogous hormone, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), is also produced and secreted mainly by the heart and has hormonal activities similar to ANP (6Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Suga S. Imura H. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The activities of ANP and BNP are mediated by the ANP receptor or the A-type natriuretic peptide receptor carrying intrinsic guanylate cyclase (GCase) catalytic activity. Binding of the hormone to the receptor stimulates GCase catalytic activity, thereby elevating intracellular cGMP levels. cGMP, in turn, mediates the hormonal actions through cGMP-regulated ion channels, protein kinases, and phosphodiesterases. The ANP receptor occurs as a dimer of a single span transmembrane polypeptide, each containing an extracellular hormone-binding domain and an intracellular domain consisting of a protein kinase-like, ATP-dependent regulatory domain and a GCase catalytic domain (7Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Chang M.S. Lowe D.G. Chin H.M. Goeddel D.V. Schulz S. Nature. 1989; 338: 78-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which ANP binding to the extracellular domain stimulates the catalytic activity of the intracellular GCase domain is not understood. A closely related receptor, the B-type natriuretic peptide receptor, mediates actions of C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which occurs mostly in the brain. CNP and the B-type receptor are thought to play a role in the central nervous system-mediated control of blood pressure and salt-fluid balance (6Nakao K. Ogawa Y. Suga S. Imura H. J. Hypertens. 1992; 10: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 8Koller K.J. Lowe D.G. Bennett G.L. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Goeddel D.V.

The B-type receptor has ∼60% sequence identity with the A-type receptor and has a similar overall molecular topology. It is likely then that the B-type receptor has a signaling mechanism similar to that of the A-type receptor. Yet another related receptor, the natriuretic peptide clearance-receptor, lacks the GCase domain and is not GCase-coupled (10Fuller F. Porter J.G. Arfsten A.E. Miller J. Schilling J.W. Scarborough R.M. Lewicki J.A. Schenk D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9395-9401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The clearance-receptor binds ANP, BNP, and CNP as well as some of their biologically inactive fragments with equally high affinity and removes the excesses of these peptides from the circulation (11Maack T.

The clearance-receptor has not been linked to any of the known hormonal actions of natriuretic peptides. The GCase-coupled A-type and B-type natriuretic peptide receptors belong to the family of membrane-bound receptor GCases that include guanylin and enterotoxin receptors (13Schulz S. Green C.K. Yuen P.S. Garbers D.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 941-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), retinal GCases (14Lowe D.G. Dizhoor A.M. Liu K. Gu Q. Spencer M. Laura R. Lu L. Hurley J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5535-5539Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), and olfactory cell GCases (15Fulle H.J. Vassar R. Foster D.C. Yang R.B. Axel R. Garbers D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3571-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These receptor GCases, in turn, belong to the superfamily of single span transmembrane receptors for which the mechanism of transmembrane signaling has not been well defined. To elucidate the signaling mechanism of the ANP receptor, we have expressed and purified the extracellular hormone-binding domain of the receptor (ANPR) in a soluble form (16Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and have characterized its biochemical properties, including the disulfide bond structure (17Miyagi M. Misono K.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1478: 30-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), glycosyl structure (18Miyagi M. Zhang X. Misono K.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5758-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and requirement for chloride ion for its binding with ANP (19Misono K.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We have also crystallized the ANPR without the hormone (apoANPR) and determined its x-ray structure (20van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The apoANPR was originally described as occurring in a tail-to-tail dimer form associated through its membrane-proximal domain (20van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, it was later recognized that the crystal packing of apoANPR also contained an alternative dimer pair, a head-to-head dimer, associated through the membrane-distal domain. Both the tail-to-tail and head-to-head dimer interfaces involve a large buried surface area (1,680 and 1,100 Å2, respectively) and multiple residue contacts. Thus, from the crystallographic data alone, it has not been possible to distinguish which dimer form represents the physiological ANP receptor dimer structure. We have recently reported site-directed mutagenesis studies of the residue involved in the two possible dimer interfaces in the full-length ANP receptor expressed on COS cells. We have found that certain mutations at the head-to-head dimer interface cause the receptor to become either uncoupled or constitutively GCase active, whereas mutations at the tail-to-tail dimer interface cause no such effect (21Qiu Y. Ogawa H. Miyagi M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6115-6123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These results strongly suggest that the extracellular domain of the native ANP receptor on the cell surface assumes the head-to-head dimer structure and that the tail-to-tail apoANPR dimer previously described represents an artificial crystallographic dimer pair occurring only in the crystal packing. The head-to-head dimer structure for the apoANPR is similar to that proposed for the extracellular domain of the natriuretic peptide clearance-receptor (22He X. Chow D. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have determined the crystal structure of the ANPR complexed with the hormone ANP. The comparison of the complex structure, also occurring in the head-to-head configuration, with the unbound structure reveals a structural change caused by ANP binding and suggests a structural basis for transmembrane signaling by the ANP receptor. Crystallization of ANPR·ANP Complex and Data Collection—Expression and purification of the ANPR (16Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and crystallization of the ANPR·ANP complex were carried out as described elsewhere (23Ogawa H. Zhang X. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1831-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Briefly, the ANPR was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified by ANP affinity chromatography. The ANPR was obtained N-glycosylated (18Miyagi M. Zhang X. Misono K.S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 5758-5768Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The ANPR was treated with sialidase to reduce heterogeneity in the glycosyl structure and was again purified by ANP affinity chromatography. The complex of the ANPR (10 mg/ml) and an ANP peptide consisting of residues 7–27 (sequence: Cys-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Ile-Asp-Arg-Ile-Gly-Ala-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Gly-Cys-Asn-Ser-Phe-Arg) was crystallized by hanging drop vapor diffusion at room temperature with 1.6-2.0 m ammonium sulfate in 0.1 m MES buffer, pH 6.5, containing 10 mm NaCl. These conditions differ from those used for crystallizing the apoANPR. Crystals were dialyzed against high concentrations of ammonium sulfate solution and were frozen in liquid propane. The crystals had the space group of P61 with unit cell parameters a = b = 100.1 Å, and c = 259.8 Å. Two ANPR molecules are present in an asymmetric unit with a VM (Mathews coefficient) of 3.9 Å3/dalton. Data were collected at 100 K at Advanced Photon Source beamline 19-ID and National Synchrotron Light Source beamlines X4A and X25. Data were processed and scaled using the HKL package (24Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 306-326Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program CNS (25Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar), using one ANPR molecule in the apoANPR dimer structure (Protein Data Base accession number 1DP4) as the search model (Table I). Molecular replacement calculations were also performed using the individual membrane-proximal and membrane-distal domains as the model, which gave essentially the same structure. Refinement was done with the program REFMAC (26Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13870) Google Scholar) without imposing non-crystallographic symmetry restraints. Rebuilding and correction of the model was guided by σA weighted 2 Fo - Fc map with the program TURBO-FRODO (BioGraphics). The structure of bound ANP was traced in a single unique conformation occurring in 2-fold symmetry orientations (Supplemental Fig. 1). The ANP structure was refined as alternate conformations with equal occupancy. Residues 427–435 of monomer A and residues 253–256 and 426–435 of monomer B had insufficient electron density to be assigned. The stereochemistry of the final structure was analyzed with PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). Assignment of the secondary structures was done using program DSSP (28Kabsch W. Sander C.

Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). ANPR was crystallized with an ANP peptide with the sequence Cys-Phe-Gly-Gly-Arg-Ile-Asp-Arg-Ile-Gly-Ala-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Gly-Cys-Asn-Ser-Phe-Arg (Cys-7 and Cys-23 are disulfide-bonded) representing ANP residues 7–27 (23Ogawa H. Zhang X. Qiu Y. Ogata C.M. Misono K.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1831-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This peptide is fully hormonally active (29Misono K.S. Grammer R.T. Fukumi H. Inagami T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 123: 444-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Bovy P.R. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The structure of ANP-bound receptor complex (Fig. 1a) was determined to 2.95 Å resolution (Table I). The asymmetric unit of the crystal contains two ANPR molecules bound with one molecule of ANP, forming a 2:1 complex. Because the ANP molecule has no internal symmetry, binding of ANP to the receptor is asymmetric. Bound ANP occurs in two alternate conformations (orientations) of equal occupancy (0.5) related by a 2-fold axis of symmetry (Supplemental Fig. 1). The 2-fold symmetry in the electron density for ANP suggests that these two alternate bound conformations are equally distributed in the crystal packing. The ANPR monomer has membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains, each consisting of a central β-sheet surrounded by several α-helices. The membrane-distal domain contains a bound chloride ion (20van den Akker F. Zhang X. Miyagi M. Huo X. Misono K.S. Yee V.C. Nature. 2000; 406: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) necessary for ANP binding (19Misono K.S. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1135-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The two ANPR monomers, also related by non-crystallographic 2-fold symmetry, form a head-to-head dimer through their membrane-distal domains (Fig. 1a). ANP-induced Structure Changes—To examine the structural basis for ANP receptor signaling, the structure of the ANP-bound ANPR dimer complex (Fig. 1a) was compared with that of the apoANPR dimer (Fig. 1b). The ANP-induced structural change involves a shift in the relative positions of the two ANPR monomers as shown in Fig. 2 (also shown in Supplemental Animation 2). There is no appreciable intramolecular conformational change in each individual ANPR monomer (root mean square deviation of Cα, 0.64 Å) (Fig. 3a). Upon ANP binding, the two ANPR molecules undergo a twist motion centered on a fulcrum point O (Fig. 2). In the front view, ANP binding leads to a seesaw-like motion, centered on point O, that causes the dimer interface to partially open and the membrane-proximal domains to close onto the bound ANP (Fig. 2a). Seen from the side, this motion is accompanied by a counter-clockwise rotation of each monomer, again centered on point O (Fig. 2b). In the juxtamembrane region, this twist motion of the two monomers results in translation of the two membrane-proximal domains by ∼10 Å in opposite directions (arrows) (Fig. 2c, bottom view). The distance between the two domains is essentially unchanged. Near the membrane, amino acid residues Pro-417, Cys-423 (and its disulfide-bond counterpart Cys-432), and Phe-425 constitute the juxtamembrane signaling motif (31Huo X. Abe T. Misono K.S. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16941-16951Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), a structure that is conserved among receptor-GCases and plays a critical role in transmembrane signaling. The movement of these residues shows that the two juxtamembrane domains undergo a parallel translocation. This ANP-induced parallel translocation alters the relative orientation of the two juxtamembrane domains, likely initiating transmembrane signaling.Fig. 3Intramolecular conformational change induced by ligand binding in the ANPR and in the natriuretic peptide clearance-receptor extracellular domain.a, superpositioning of the structure of the ANP-bound ANPR (orange) onto that of unbound ANPR (cyan) in front view. ANP binding causes little intramolecular conformational change (root mean square deviation of Cα, 0.64 Å). b, superpositioning of the clearance-receptor extracellular domain structure in the CNP-bound form (red) onto the unbound form (green) (22He X. Chow D. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the clearance-receptor, ligand binding causes each subunit to bend at the flexible intrasubunit hinge structure from “closed” to “open” position, allowing the membrane-proximal domain to swing toward the bound ligand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Comparison with the Natriuretic Peptide Clearance-receptor—The above hormone-induced structural change in the ANP receptor differs markedly from that found in the natriuretic peptide clearance-receptor upon CNP binding (22He X. Chow D. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In the clearance-receptor, the structural change occurs within each receptor monomer. CNP binding causes each monomer structure to “open” at the flexible intramolecular hinge connecting the membrane-distal and membrane-proximal domains (Fig. 3b). This bending causes the membrane-proximal domain to swing onto the bound ligand, leaving the membrane-distal domain and its dimerized structure essentially unchanged (Supplemental Fig. 3). This motion approximates the two membrane-proximal domains but does not change their relative orientation. Unlike the ANP receptor, the clearance-receptor lacks the GCase domain (10Fuller F. Porter J.G. Arfsten A.E. Miller J. Schilling J.W. Scarborough R.M. Lewicki J.A. Schenk D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9395-9401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is not known to mediate any of the known hormonal activities of natriuretic peptides. The clearance-receptor binds ANP, BNP, and CNP as well as some of their biologically inactive fragments with equally high affinity in order to remove the excess of these peptides from the circulation (11Maack T. Suzuki M. Almeida F.A. Nussenzveig D. Scarborough R.M. McEnroe G.A. Lewicki J.A. Science. 1987; 238: 675-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 12Cohen D. Koh G.Y. Nikonova L.N. Porter J.G. Maack T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9863-9869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The difference in the ligand-induced motion in the ANP receptor from that in the clearance-receptor may reflect the fact that the ANP receptor mediates hormonal signaling, whereas the clearance-receptor affects metabolic clearance. Additionally, the conformational flexibility at the intramolecular hinge in the clearance-receptor (22He X. Chow D. Martick M.M. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 293: 1657-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) may be responsible for its broad ligand specificity. Dimer Interface Structure—At the dimer interface in the apoANPR structure (Fig. 4, shown in cyan), intermolecular contacts are made through hydrophobic interaction between Trp-74 of one monomer (monomer A) (residue Trp-74A) and Trp-74B of the other (monomer B), two hydrogen bonds (bluedotted lines) between Asp-71A and His-99B and between His-99A and Asp-71B, and hydrophobic interaction between Phe-96A and Phe-96B. Upon ANP binding, the dimer interface partially opens (Fig. 4, shown in orange), breaking the hydrophobic contact Trp-74A-Trp-74B and hydrogen bonds Asp-71A-His-99B and His-99A-Asp-71B. The hydrophobic contact Phe-96A-Phe-96B, on the other hand, remains and apparently contributes to stabilizing the ANP-bound activated receptor complex. We have found that mutation of Asp 71 to Arg (D71R) or W74R in the full-length ANP receptor as expressed on COS cells produced a receptor mutant that is constitutively GCase active (21Qiu Y. Ogawa H. Miyagi M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6115-6123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These mutations incorporate opposing charges at the dimer interface. The electrostatic repulsion between the charges may force the interface of the apo receptor dimer to become partially open even in the absence of ANP and generate a structure that partially mimics the activated receptor complex. Such an effect may be responsible for the partial constitutive activation of GCase activity. On the other hand, F96D mutation produced an uncoupled receptor mutant that bound ANP but did not cause cGMP stimulation. F96D mutation incorporates two negatively charged residues facing each other near the center of the monomer movement point O. The repulsive force between the two charges may distort the structure of the bound complex and abolish signaling and GCase activation. Thus, the results of mutagenesis studies performed with the full-length ANP receptor expressed on the COS cell surface are consistent with the crystal structures of the apo and ANP-bound ANPR dimer and with the ANP-induced structural change identified from these structures. This finding, in turn, suggests that the hormone-induced structural change identified in this study likely reflects that occurring in the native full-length ANP receptor in the membrane. ANP-binding Site and Binding Interactions—Binding of ANP is asymmetric, and the binding site in one ANPR molecule (site A) differs from that in the other (site B) (Fig. 5a). Site A interacts mainly with the N-terminal part of the ANP peptide, whereas site B interacts mainly with the C-terminal part (Supplemental Tables 1–3). Buried surface areas at the two sites are nearly equal (1,374 and 1,367 Å2 for sites A and B, respectively), suggesting significant contributions of both sites to hormone binding. The surface structures of both sites A and B have a ring-shaped groove lined with polar residues (Fig. 5, b and c). ANP fits closely into the groove at both sites, consistent with the high ligand specificity of the ANP receptor. Upon binding, ANP residue Arg-14 (Arg-14(ANP)) forms hydrogen bonds with Asp-62B and Glu-119A. These hydrogen bonds may play a key role in holding together the partially open dimer interface (Fig. 4) and stabilizing the structure of the ANP-bound ANPR dimer complex. The critical role of Arg-14(ANP) is consistent with the finding that this residue is essential for the hormonal activity of ANP (30Bovy P.R. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). An additional hydrogen bond occurring between Arg-95A and Asp-62B also contributes to the stability of the complex. Residue Phe-8(ANP), essential for hormonal activity, extends to and makes hydrophobic contact with a hydrophobic cavity in site A formed by residues Tyr-154A, Phe-165A, Val-168A, and Tyr-172A (Supplemental Tables 1–3). The C-terminal segment of ANP (residues Asn-24(ANP)-Arg-27(ANP)) runs parallel with a stretch of β-sheet in the ANPR (residues Gln-186B-Phe-188B), and a hydrogen bond occurs between Asn-24(ANP) carbonyl oxygen and Glu-187B amide nitrogen, suggesting partial formation of a parallel β-sheet (Fig. 5a). An additional hydrogen bond occurs between Asn-24(ANP) and His-185B. These interactions are consistent with the finding that the C-terminal residues of ANP are necessary for receptor binding and hormonal activities (30Bovy P.R. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The agreement found here between the ANP residues involved in binding and the structure-activity relationship for ANP (30Bovy P.R. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) confirms the assigned ANP peptide structure in the complex and, at the same time, suggests that the crystal structure of this complex closely reflects the structure of the native ANP receptor bound with ANP. ANP residues contributing to binding to the receptor are all conserved in BNP, including Arg-14, Phe-8, Asp-24 (Asn-24 in ANP), and Arg-24 (Supplemental Fig. 1e). The conservation of these critical residues suggests that the mechanism of BNP binding to this receptor as well as the resulting structural change in the receptor may be similar to those described here for ANP. The ANP receptor binds ANP and BNP with high affinity but shows weak affinity to CNP (16Misono K.S. Sivasubramanian N. Berkner K. Zhang X. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The weak affinity to CNP, which lacks C-terminal residues (Supplemental Fig. 1e), may be because of its inability to form the C-terminal interaction. The orientation of the bound ANP is consistent with the results of affinity labeling reaction in which ANP peptide analogs containing an electrophilic iodoacetyl group at positions 18 and 29 reacted with Met-173 and Asp-194 of the receptor, respectively. 2K. Misono, manuscript in preparation. In the crystal structure of the complex, Gln-18(ANP) is positioned close to Met-173A and Arg-27(ANP) is positioned near Asp-194A (Fig. 5b), corroborating the structure assignment for the bound ANP. Rotation Mechanism for ANP Receptor Signaling—Fig. 6a illustrates schematically the movement of the two ANPR molecules induced upon ANP binding. Each ANPR molecule is shown by a solid cylinder because ANP binding causes little intramolecular conformational change. Upon ANP binding, the two molecules undergo a twist motion centered on point O and close onto the ligand ANP. In cross-section at the juxtamembrane region (Fig. 6a, arrow) seen from the top (Fig. 6b), this twist motion causes the juxtamembrane domains of the two molecules (depicted by circles) to translocate, by an angle of 24° with respect to point O, from the apo position (circle Capo)tothe complexed position (Ccom) without appreciable change in the interdomain distance. This parallel translation alters the relative orientation of the two juxtamembrane domains in the receptor dimer. This change in the orientation is equivalent to rotating each of the two domains by 24° counterclockwise (Fig. 6b, inset). Earlier, Koshland and co-workers (32Ottemann K.M. Xiao W. Shin Y.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Science. 1999; 285: 1751-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) postulated models for transmembrane signaling mechanism that depended on the hypothetical motion in the transmembrane region. Their models included association, dissociation, piston, rotation, scissor, and seesaw models. The ANP-induced motion of the juxtamembrane domains in the ANP receptor corresponds closely to the rotation mechanism postulated by these investigators (shown schematically in Fig. 6b, inset). Signaling by many single span transmembrane receptors is thought to occur by the association (or clustering) mechanism. Association of the receptor molecules to a dimer (or an oligomer) brings their intracellular domains close together. The proximity of the intracellular domain, in turn, triggers the actions of the effector-enzyme domains inside the cell. Certain single span transmembrane receptors, such as the erythropoietin (EPO) receptor, occur as a preformed dimer in the absence of the hormone. In the crystal structure of the extracellular domain of the EPO receptor, two C termini in the juxtamembrane region are apart by 73 Å in the apo dimer (33Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). EPO binding causes a large conformational change in the dimer that closes the C termini distance to 39 Å (33Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 34Syed R.S. Reid S.W. Li C. Cheetham J.C. Aoki K.H. Liu B. Zhan H. Osslund T.D. Chirino A.J. Zhang J. Finer-Moore J. Elliott S. Sitney K. Katz B.A. Matthews D.J. Wendoloski J.J. Egrie J. Stroud R.M. Nature. 1998; 395: 511-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). This approximation of the two C termini is suggested to trigger the intracellular signaling cascade. It has also been shown by fluorescence-conjugation assay that EPO binding brings the intracellular domains into proximity (35Remy I. Wilson I.A. Michnick S.W. Science. 1999; 283: 990-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar), supporting the association (or approximation) mechanism proposed for EPO receptor signaling (33Livnah O. Stura E.A. Middleton S.A. Johnson D.L. Jolliffe L.K. Wilson I.A. Science. 1999; 283: 987-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). In contrast, the juxtamembrane domains of the ANP receptor dimer are close to each other even in the absence of the hormone, and ANP binding causes no appreciable change in the interdomain distance (Figs. 2c and 6b). Instead, ANP binding causes a large 24° rotation of each of the two juxtamembrane domains, altering their relative orientations (Fig. 6b). In the intact ANP receptor, this hormone-induced rotation of the juxtamembrane domains, transduced through the transmembrane helices, may reorient the relative positions (or configuration) of the intracellular domains to cause GCase activation (Fig. 7). The ANPR expressed in a soluble form lacks the transmembrane and intracellular domains and, for this reason, its apo and ANP-bound structures may not precisely reflect those of the native full-length receptor in the cell membrane. However, we showed earlier that the effects of mutations at the dimer interface in the full-length receptor on COS cells are consistent with the crystal structures of the apo and hormone-bound ANPR and with the ANP-induced structural change identified from those structures (21Qiu Y. Ogawa H. Miyagi M. Misono K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6115-6123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Additionally, binding interactions found in the complex structure are in agreement with the structure-activity relationship for ANP (30Bovy P.R. Med. Res. Rev. 1990; 10: 115-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These findings together suggest strongly that the ANP-induced structural change identified in this study reflects that occurring in the native receptor in the cell membrane and support the proposed rotation mechanism initiating ANP receptor signal transduction. The structures of the intact receptor in the membrane with and without bound ANP should provide direct evidence for the mechanism in the future. Soluble GCase, which has ∼51% sequence identity with the GCase domain of the ANP receptor, is active only as a dimer even though each monomer carries a GCase catalytic site (36Nakane M. Murad F. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 26: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The GCase domain of ANP receptor, when expressed in a soluble form by truncation of the extracellular, transmembrane, and kinase-like domains, spontaneously forms a dimer and is catalytically active (37Wilson E.M. Chinkers M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4696-4701Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). It is possible that in the intact ANP receptor dimer the GCase catalytic activity is suppressed because the two GCase domains are unable to form an active dimer configuration. We speculate that, upon ANP binding and in the presence of ATP (an obligatory and positive allosteric effector for GCase activation by ANP (38Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 39Chinkers M. Singh S. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4088-4093Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), ANP-induced rotation of the juxtamembrane domains may alter the relative positions (or the conformation) of the intracellular domains such that the catalytic sites of the two GCase domains are brought to an optimal proximity and orientation, thereby giving rise to GCase catalytic activity (Fig. 7). The rotation mechanism initiating transmembrane signaling by the ANP receptor uncovered in the present study represents, to our knowledge, the first such mechanism identified for any known class of single span transmembrane receptors. At the same time, this finding introduces a new paradigm whereby a transmembrane conformational change involving a rotation, rather than simple association or approximation of the receptor molecules, mediates transmembrane signal transduction.

The ubiquitin protein ligase activity of c-Cbl (abbreviated as E3 activity) is mediated by its RING finger domain. We show here that the E3 activity of c-Cbl is negatively regulated by other domains present in the amino-terminal half of the protein (the TKB and linker helix domains) and that this negative regulation is removed when the protein is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Protease digestion studies indicate that tyrosine phosphorylation alters the conformation of c-Cbl. We also show that mutation of certain conserved tyrosine residues to glutamate can constitutively activate the E3 activity of c-Cbl. In particular, a Y371E mutant shows constitutive E3 activity while retaining the ability to bind epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). The Y371E mutant also has altered protease sensitivity from wild type, instead resembling the proteolytic pattern seen with tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Cbl. Mutation of the homologous tyrosine residue in Cbl-b to glutamate also leads to E3 activation while retaining EGFR-binding ability. These studies argue that Tyr-371 plays a key role in activating the E3 activity of c-Cbl and that the Y371E mutant may partially mimic phosphorylation at that site. However, Tyr-371 point mutants of c-Cbl are still able to undergo phosphorylation-induced E3 activation, and we show that Tyr-368 can also be phosphorylated in addition to Tyr-371, and contributes to activation. c-Cbl down-regulates receptor tyrosine kinases by conjugating ubiquitin to them, leading to receptor internalization and degradation.

The c-Cbl proto-oncogene was first discovered as the cellular homologue of v-Cbl, a viral transforming gene from the Cas NS-1 murine retrovirus, which causes pre-B cell lymphomas and myelogenous leukemias in mice (1Langdon W.Y.

The transforming gene v-Cbl is a truncation mutant of c-Cbl, which itself does not transform cells (2Blake T.J. Shapiro M. Morse H.C. Langdon W.Y. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 653-657PubMed Google Scholar). Human c-Cbl encodes a widely expressed cytosolic protein of 906 amino acids, which is a prominent substrate of a variety of tyrosine kinases and undergoes binding interactions with a large number of intracellular signaling molecules (3Langdon W.Y.

Robbins K.C. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2367-2377PubMed Google Scholar) and Cbl-3 (10Keane M.M. Ettenberg S.E. Nau M.M. Banerjee P. Cuello M. Penninger J. Lipkowitz S. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3365-3375Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), and Cbl homologues have been identified in Caenorhabditis elegans (11Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and Drosophila (12Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar).The amino terminus of c-Cbl contains a conserved functional domain that binds phosphotyrosine, composed of a four-helix bundle, a Ca2+-binding EF hand domain, and a variant SH2 domain (13Meng W. Sawadikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). These structural components together comprise a functional unit that has been called the TKB domain (for tyrosine-kinase binding). A short helical linker region connects the TKB domain to a RING finger domain that contains two bound zinc ions. The TKB, linker helix, and RING domains are well conserved among all Cbl family members.Important clues regarding Cbl function have come from genetic studies in C. elegans and Drosophila, in which it was found that Cbl family members act to negatively regulate receptor tyrosine kinases (11Yoon C.H. Lee J. Jongeward G.D. Sternberg P.W. Science. 1995; 269: 1102-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 12Meisner H. Daga A. Buxton J. Fernandez B. Chawla A. Banerjee U. Czech M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies in mammalian cells have confirmed this negative regulatory role of Cbl, and a mechanism for the down-regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases by Cbl has been provided by the discovery of ubiquitin protein ligase activity in c-Cbl, mediated by the RING finger domain (14Miyake S.

The first step in this process involves ATP-dependent formation of a thioester between the C terminus of ubiquitin and the active site cystine of ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1). A second thioester intermediate is subsequently formed between ubiquitin and one of several ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (abbreviated as E2s, or ubc). In the final step of the process, E2s act in concert with ubiquitin protein ligases (E3s) to form an iso-peptide bond between the carboxyl terminus of ubiquitin and a free amino group on the substrate protein. In most cases, ubiquitin conjugation results in multiubiquitin chains that target the substrate for degradation by proteasomes or, in some cases, lysosomes. In a few cases, conjugation of single ubiquitin moieties can produce a relatively stable post-translational modification of certain substrate proteins.Two major families of E3s are known, HECT proteins (homology to E6-associated protein carboxyl terminus) and RING finger-containing proteins. Although not all proteins that contain a RING domain are E3s, a large and growing number of RING proteins have been found to have ubiquitin ligase activity. The RING domain is important for binding E2s, and a recent crystal structure of a complex of an amino-terminal fragment of c-Cbl and the E2, UbcH7 has provided precise details of that interaction (23Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffery P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar).The E3 activity of c-Cbl has been reported to be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, and a mutational study was done by Levkowitz et al. (19Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) to try to define the key tyrosine residues in c-Cbl responsible for that activation. In that study, a series of tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutants in c-Cbl were transfected into Chinese hamster ovary cells along with the EGF receptor, and the ability of EGF to induce ubiquitination of EGFR was measured. Wild type c-Cbl and Y to F point mutants at positions 92, 274, 291, 307, 337, and 368 were all able to enhance EGFR ubiquitination under these conditions, whereas Y371F was inactive. The authors concluded that Tyr-371 was the key site for phosphorylation-induced activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl. However, this interpretation was subsequently called into question by the structural studies of Zheng et al. (23Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffery P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar), who stated that this tyrosine residue was not solvent-accessible, and instead was internally hydrogen-bonded to threonine 227. These authors implied that tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at Tyr-371 would disrupt the structure of the enzyme, rather than merely removing a phosphorylation site. These two models for the function of Tyr-371 would appear to be mutually exclusive.In the studies reported here, we further investigate the mechanism of phosphorylation-induced activation of the ubiquitin ligase activity of c-Cbl. As part of this work, we have attempted to resolve the controversy over which tyrosines are required for activation by generating gain-of-function mutations in c-Cbl to try to avoid the problems inherent in loss-of-function studies.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of GST-Cbl Fusion Proteins and Cbl Point Mutants— All GST-Cbl fusion proteins were made from corresponding pGEX-Cbl plasmids based on the vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). Inserts were constructed by PCR using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), a cDNA clone of human c-Cbl provided by W. Langdon (University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia) as template, and PCR primers containing compatible restriction sites. pGEX-Cbl-RING contains an insert encoding amino acids 358–447 of c-Cbl preceded by an EcoR1 site and followed by a stop codon and an NotI site. pGEX-Cbl 1–480 contains a BamH1 site immediately preceding sequences encoding amino acids 1–480 of c-Cbl and followed by a stop codon and an NotI site. c-Cbl point mutants were constructed by PCR. All mutations were verified by sequencing. GST fusion proteins were produced in Escherichia coli strains DH5α or BL21 containing the appropriate pGEX plasmid as follows. 500-ml cultures were grown to log phase (A600 of 0.5–0.7) and induced by addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.1 mm final. After 3–4 h of induction, cells were harvested, rinsed with 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, and frozen at –80 °C. Cell pellets were later thawed and resuspended in 10–15 ml of 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, bestatin, and E64. Cells were lysed by the addition of 100 μg/ml lysozyme and 1% Triton X-100 or 1% Thesit (Roche Applied Science) for 15–30 min followed by sonication. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 25,000 × g and then incubated with 0.5–1.0 ml of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads for 30 min to 1 h at 23 °C or 2–15 h at 4 °C with rotation. The beads were washed 3 × 10 ml with the above buffer containing 0.1% Thesit and then placed in a column and eluted overnight at 4 °C with 20 mm reduced glutathione, 100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.01% Thesit at 1–2 ml/h. Protein-containing fractions were pooled, concentrated, and dialyzed first against 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm DTT, pH 7.5, and then against the same buffer containing 50% glycerol and 0.01% Thesit. Dialyzed proteins were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 13,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min and stored at –20 °C. Protein concentrations were measured by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were prepared in the E. coli strains TKX1 or TKB1 induced as described by the manufacturer (Stratagene) and lysed as described above except that the lysis buffer also contained 50 mm NaF and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and lacked DTT. GST-Cbl-b 1–480 and the corresponding Y363E mutant were produced by similar methods from a human cDNA clone provided by Stanley Lipkowitz, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD.In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—GST-ubiquitin was produced in E. coli using a pGEX-2TK-based expression plasmid obtained from Martin Scheffner, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany. This plasmid was introduced into DH5α cells, and the cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, and GST-ubiquitin was purified as described for the GST-Cbl fusion proteins above. Purified GST-ubiquitin was 32P-labeled in HMK buffer (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 12 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT) containing 0.8 μCi/μl[λ-32P]ATP ([λ-32P]ATP was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 0.3 unit/μl of bovine heart kinase (Sigma #P-2645) for 30 min at 12 °C, then the reaction was quenched by addition of 10 volumes of stop solution (10 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0). Glutathione-agarose was then added, and the mixture was rotated at 4 °C for 30 min to 1 h. The beads were washed five times with PBS containing 0.1% Thesit and then treated with thrombin in the same buffer for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C with rotation. Following thrombin cleavage, PMSF was added to 2 mm final, and the beads were spun and washed three times with PBS to recover the [32P]ubiquitin in the supernatant. Wheat E1 and human UbcH5b were expressed in E. coli from the plasmids pETUBA1 (Rick Vierstra, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI, obtained from Mark Hochstrasser, Yale University, New Haven, CT) and pET15b-UbcH5b (Alan Weissman, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and purified by covalent affinity chromatography on ubiquitin agarose as described (24Tongaonkar P.

In vitro ubiquitination reactions were performed in 20 μl of total volume containing 185 ng of E1, 1 μg of UbcH5b, and 2 μg of GST-Cbl fusion proteins in a buffer containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system consisting of 10 mm creatine phosphate, 3.5 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 0.6 unit/ml of inorganic pyrophosphatase. [32P]Ubiquitin was prepared to specific activities ranging from 3.5 × 105 to 4.6 × 106 cpm/μg, and 100,000–500,000 cpm was added per reaction. Reactions were set up on ice and then transferred to 30 °C for various times; time points were quenched by adding an equal volume of 2× SDS sample buffer followed by boiling.Protease Digestions—GST fusion proteins were first cleaved with thrombin, treated with PMSF and glutathione-Sepharose to inactivate thrombin and remove GST, and then dialyzed and concentrated into 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 50% glycerol. The resulting Cbl 1–480 proteins were stored at –20 °C. For digestions, proteins were adjusted to 0.2 mg/ml in buffer lacking glycerol and digested with protease at 10 μg/ml at 37 °C. Proteinase K was obtained from Sigma, and digests were performed in the above buffer lacking glycerol.Trypsin digestions were performed similarly using Sequencing Grade trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI) and the following buffer: 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT. Aliquots were removed at the indicated time points, treated with PMSF, and then boiled in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels followed by Coomassie staining.For identification of phosphorylation sites, 50 μg of P-Cbl 1–480 was adjusted to 1% SDS and 5 mm DTT and boiled for 5 min. After cooling, 10 mm iodoacetamide was added, and the sample was incubated 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The sample was then diluted 10-fold into 1% Thesit, 100 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm CaCl2 and digested with 2.5 μg of trypsin for 7 h at 37 °C followed by 15 h at room temperature. PMSF was then added to a final concentration of 2 mm followed by 10 μl of a 50% slurry of agarose beads containing immobilized monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, catalog number 16-101). The sample was rotated at room temperature for 3 h, and the beads were then spun out and washed three times with PBS and three times with H2O. All supernatant was removed, and the beads were eluted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile, for analysis by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Expected masses were calculated using the program ProteinProspector. 2P. R. Baker and K. R. Clauser, available at prospector.ucsf.edu. Cell Lysate Preparation and EGFR Binding Assay—The human mammary epithelial cell line MCF12A was obtained from the University of Colorado Cancer Center Tissue Culture Core Facility and cultured in a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 supplemented with 5% horse serum, 1 mm l-glutamine, 10 μg/ml insulin, 0.5 μg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.1 μg/ml cholera toxin, 20 ng/ml EGF, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Horse serum was from Sigma, and charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum was obtained from HyClone (Logan, UT). Murine epidermal growth factor was obtained from Collaborative Biomedical Products (Bedford, MA). All other media components were from Invitrogen. Quiescent cells were obtained by overnight culture (16 h) in media containing 2% charcoal-stripped serum instead of 5% horse serum and lacking other growth factors. EGF stimulation was done by adding 100 ng/ml EGF to quiescent cells, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min prior to lysis. Cells were harvested by rinsing in ice-cold PBS, and then lysed by the addition of 0.8 ml per 10-cm dish of ice-cold EB (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) containing the following protease inhibitors: 100 units/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, bestatin, and E64. Cells were scraped from the dish, and the lysates were clarified by spinning in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Clarified lysates were stored at –80 °C.For EGFR binding, 10 μg of purified GST fusion proteins were added to 0.5 ml of MCF12A lysate containing 0.5 mg of protein in EB plus protease inhibitors. Reactions were incubated at 4 °C for 1 h, and then 40 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) was added, and the tubes were rotated at 4 °C for an additional hour. The tubes were then spun briefly to pellet the beads, the beads were washed four times with EB buffer, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The resolved proteins were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA) for Western blotting using EGFR antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, catalogue no. SC-03). Detection of proteins by immunoblotting was conducted using the Enhanced Chemiluminescence system (ECL) according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Biosciences).RESULTSThe TKB Domain and/or Linker Helix of c-Cbl Modulate the E3 Activity of the RING Domain in a Phosphorylation-dependent Manner—The carboxyl-terminal half of c-Cbl and Cbl-b is dispensable for EGF-induced ubiquitination of EGFR and PDGFR; fragments containing approximately the first 480 amino acids are sufficient, as is Cbl-3, which is only 474 amino acids in length (10Keane M.M.

To investigate the regulation of the E3 activity of c-Cbl, we have therefore focused our investigations on this region of the molecule. We first set out to establish an in vitro ubiquitination system, using only purified components expressed in E. coli. The system contains 32P-labeled ubiquitin, E1, UbcH5b as E2, GST-c-Cbl fusion proteins as E3s, and an ATP-regenerating system. We first examined the behavior of a GST fusion construct containing amino acids 358–447 of c-Cbl, essentially the RING finger domain and a few flanking amino acids (GST-Cbl-RING). A similar construct has been reported to demonstrate ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro (18Joazeiro C.A.P. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.-C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Similar to previous reports, we find that GST-Cbl-RING is readily auto-ubiquitinated (Fig. 1, lanes 7–12). Auto-ubiquitination of E3s is commonly observed and provides a convenient assay for ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro. No E3 activity was observed with GST alone (Fig. 1, lanes 1–6) or in the absence of ATP, E1, or E2 (data not shown). In contrast to GST-Cbl-RING, a GST fusion protein containing the entire amino-terminal half of c-Cbl (GST-Cbl 1–480) showed much less activity in this assay, suggesting that the intrinsic E3 activity of the RING domain may be inhibited by interactions from the TKB domain and/or linker helix region present in this larger construct (Fig. 1, compare lanes 13–18 with 7–12; note also that ubiquitinated GST-Cbl-RING species exhibit increased mobility due to the smaller size of this construct).To test whether this putative inhibition might be modulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, we next prepared a tyrosine-phosphorylated form of GST-Cbl 1–480, (P-GST-Cbl 1–480) using the bacterial strain TKX1, which contains an inducible elk1 tyrosine kinase. The protein purified from this strain was confirmed to contain phosphotyrosine using the phosphotyrosine-specific monoclonal antibody 4G10 (data not shown). It should be noted that we have no data at present indicating whether or not the pattern of tyrosine phosphorylation in our bacterially produced protein accurately reflects the tyrosine phosphorylation occurring in mammalian cells. However, we do find that bacterially produced P-GST-Cbl 1–480 has dramatically enhanced ubiquitin ligase activity over the unphosphorylated protein (Fig. 1, compare lanes 19–24 with 13–18; note also that E3 activity is evident even in the zero time point for P-GST-Cbl 1–480, in which the sample remained on ice rather than incubating at 30 °C). To rule out any possible effects of the GST portion of these fusion proteins, we prepared Cbl 1–480 and P-Cbl 1–480 free from GST by treating the fusion proteins with thrombin. Cbl 1–480 and P-Cbl 1–480 prepared in this way retained the ubiquitin ligase activities of the parent GST fusion proteins (data not shown). Taken together, these data argue that the TKB domain and/or linker helix region of c-Cbl regulate the intrinsic E3 activity of the RING domain in a phosphorylation-dependent manner.Analyzing the Phosphorylation-induced E3 Activity of c-Cbl Using Tyrosine to Phenylalanine Point Mutations: Tyr-268 Is Not Required for Activation—Previous investigators have examined the question of which tyrosine residues in c-Cbl are critical for activation of its ubiquitin ligase activity, however the question remains controversial. Analysis is complicated by the large number of residues to be considered; c-Cbl contains 22 tyrosine residues. However, only six of these are completely conserved between the five known Cbl family members, corresponding to residues 268, 274, 291, 307, 337, and 371 of c-Cbl. Two additional tyrosine residues are conserved in four of the five Cbl family members (corresponding to residues 92 and 368 of c-Cbl). Levkowitz et al. (19Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M. Tsygankov A.Y. Alroy I. Lavi S. Iwai K. Reiss Y. Ciechanover A. Lipkowitz S. Yarden Y. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1029-1040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar) approached the question by generating a series of tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutants in c-Cbl; they found that Tyr to Phe point mutations at sites 92, 274, 291, 307, 337, and 368 retained activity in their assay, whereas a Y371F mutant was inactive. However, as discussed earlier, the interpretation of this result has been controversial, with Zheng et al. (23Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffery P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) arguing from their structural studies that a Y371F mutation would disrupt the structure of c-Cbl, rather than merely removing a regulatory phosphorylation site (23Zheng N. Wang P. Jeffery P.D. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 2000; 102: 533-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). If one accepts this argument for the moment, what other conclusions can be drawn from the data of Levkowitz et al.? Because none of the other Tyr to Phe point mutations tested abolished E3 activity, two possibilities present themselves. The first is that the key tyrosine residue required for phosphorylation-induced E3 activation was not among those tested. The second possibility is that more than one tyrosine residue in c-Cbl can activate E3 activity through phosphorylation, i.e. no single tyrosine residue is absolutely required (except for the structural role played by Tyr-371). Finally, a third possibility is that the conclusions of Levkowitz et al. about phosphorylation of Tyr-371 are correct, and the arguments of Zheng et al. are incorrect. We will examine each of these possibilities in turn.The mutational study by Levkowitz et al. was extensive, but it did not include Tyr-268; this tyrosine residue is the only completely conserved tyrosine not examined in their study. To investigate whether this conserved tyrosine residue might be critical for E3 activation, we constructed a Y268F point mutant of GST-Cbl 1–480 and analyzed its behavior in vitro in both unphosphorylated and tyrosine-phosphorylated forms. As shown in Fig. 2, unphosphorylated Y268F behaves similarly to wild type GST-Cbl 1–480, with a very low level of auto-ubiquitination seen in this assay (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1 and 4).

The data obtained included the first comprehensive measurements of aerosols and cloud particles throughout the atmospheric column during the evolution of multiple deep convective storm systems. Coupling these new measurements with detailed cloud simulations that resolve the size distributions of aerosols and cloud particles, we found several lines of evidence indicating that most anvil crystals form on mid-tropospheric rather than boundary-layer aerosols. This result defies conventional wisdom and suggests that distant pollution sources may have a greater effect on anvil clouds than do local sources."

Apart from mediating cell adhesion, integrins ensure cell migration as well as transmitting proliferation and differentiation signals into cells (“outside-in signaling”). Changes in integrin ligand binding affinity also can be triggered through signals from the inside of cells (“inside-out signaling”) (3Hynes R.O.

Since integrins do not have intrinsic enzymatic activity, it is of importance to characterize proteins that bind the cytoplasmic domains of integrins and transduce integrin-dependent signals. Many integrin-binding proteins have been described (reviewed in Refs. 1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A. Cell Tissue Res. 2001; 305: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (811) Google Scholar and 2Liu S.

A third group of integrin-interacting proteins represent scaffolding or adaptor proteins (1van der Flier A. Sonnenberg A.

Mayer U. Guicheney P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 357-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Two of them, α7A and α7B, which differ only in their cytosolic parts, are differentially expressed during muscle development and regeneration (7Burkin D.J. Kaufman S.J.

Since the binding specificity of α7A and α7B integrin isoforms to different ECM molecules seems to be the same, it is very likely that functional differences of these splice forms are specified via their binding ability to certain cytosolic proteins.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and to function as a scaffolding protein in mature heart muscle, where it brings together proteins with structural and enzymatic properties (24Lange S. Auerbach D. McLoughlin P. Perriard E. Schafer B.W. Perriard J.C. Ehler E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4925-4936Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Recently, FHL2 and FHL3 have been described as transmitting signals from the cell surface to the nucleus in a Rho-dependent manner (30Müller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schüle R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), probably due to their binding to integrins or other cytoskeletal proteins. However, FHL2 null mutant mice have only a very mild heart phenotype, with a slightly altered hypertrophic response upon β-adrenergic stimulation (31Chu P.H. Bardwell W.M. Gu Y. Ross Jr., J. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7460-7462Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 32Kong Y. Shelton J.M. Rothermel B. Li X. Richardson J.A. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. Circulation. 2001; 103: 2731-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Here we show that all intracellular splice variants of the α7β1 muscle integrin receptor interact with FHL2 and FHL3 but not with the highly homologous FHL1. FHL2 and FHL3 colocalize with α7β1 integrin in focal adhesion complexes, which may occur through their binding to either the α- or the β-subunit. Furthermore, FHL2 and FHL3 colocalize with the α7β1 integrin receptor at the periphery of Z-discs in cardiac and skeletal muscles, respectively. DNA Constructs—All yeast two-hybrid pAS2–1 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) derivate constructs coding for fusion proteins of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4-BD) and full-length or truncated intracellular parts of α7A or α7B integrin subunits where produced by PCR with appropriate primers and pCEP4-α7A or pCEP4-α7B plasmids as templates (33Echtermeyer F.

The cDNA fragment coding for the complete intracellular part of human integrin αv was generated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using mRNA from 10.5-day-old mouse embryos as template and cloned in-frame into pAS2–1 vector using EcoRI/BamHI restriction sites. pAS2–1 yeast two-hybrid constructs, which code for fusion proteins of GAL4-BD and the complete intracellular part of human integrin α1, α2, α3A, α3B, α5, α6A, α6B, β1A, and β1D, were described elsewhere (6Wixler V.

Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z. Pandur P. Kuhl M. Behrens J. von der Mark K. Starzinski-Powitz A. Wixler V. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 113-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). For expression in mammalian cells, the cDNA fragment coding for complete cytoplasmic domain of integrin α7A subunit was cloned in frame into the GST tag vector pEBG as described (6Wixler V. Geerts D.

The full-length pCEP4-α7A integrin construct was obtained by replacing the B-splice variant in the pCEP4-α7B plasmid with the α7A form. The Myc-tagged or GST-tagged FHL1, FHL2, and FHL3 constructs were obtained by cloning the appropriate inserts from pACT2 vector into pCS2+MT or pEBG eukaryotic expression plasmids. For generation of the EGFP-FHL2 construct, the FHL2 insert was released from pACT2 vector and inserted in frame into the pEGFP-C1 vector (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For stable expression in C2C12 cells, the Myc-tagged FHL2 and FHL3 were released from pCS2+MT plasmids and recloned into the pBabe-neo vector. The correct in-frame cloning of the constructs was verified by sequencing. Yeast Two-hybrid Screen—A human placenta cDNA library cloned into pACT2 yeast two-hybrid vector was used (MATCHMAKER™; Clontech). The cytoplasmic parts of murine integrin α7A (aa 1104–1161) or α7B-del1 (aa 1104–1171) in pAS2–1 were used as bait in two independent screens that were performed according to the protocol of Clontech. The aa numbers refer to NCBI sequence entry (accession number Y12380). Direct Yeast Two-hybrid Interaction Assays—The yeast strain Y190 was cotransformed with the pAS2–1 plasmid containing the GAL4-BD fused with appropriate cDNAs as bait and with pACT2 plasmids containing cDNAs fused to GAL4-AD as prey. Transformants were grown on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine in the presence of 25 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole. On day 6, the colonies were tested for the lacZ reporter gene activity in a β-galactosidase filter assay. The interaction was scored as negative (-) when no blue colonies were visible after 8 h and scored as weak (+), intermediate (++), or strong (+++) when blue colonies became visible after 8, 4, or 1 h, respectively. For quantification of the β-galactosidase activity, the transformants were first grown on SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and subsequently introduced into the liquid culture assay using o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as substrate. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated according to the protocol of Clontech. Cell Culture and Antibodies—C2C12 muscle precursor cells were cultured at low densities in DMEM containing 20% fetal calf serum. HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum. All cells were grown at 37 °C and 7.5% CO2. C2C12 myoblasts stably expressing Myc-FHL2 or Myc-FHL3 were generated using a retroviral infection system as described in Ref. 26Martin B. Schneider R. Janetzky S. Waibler Z. Pandur P. Kuhl M.

Sonnenberg, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), mouse anti-FHL2, clone F4B2-B11 (recognizes the NH2-terminal half LIM domain); rabbit anti-FHL2 (epitope used for immunization: His-tagged aa 218–279); rabbit anti-FHL3 (epitope used for immunization: His-tagged aa 1–159); peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for immunoblot analysis (Amersham Biosciences), and Cy2- and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgGs (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). Immunofluorescence Stainings—Cells were trypsinized and plated on coverslips, which had been precoated with 15 μg/ml concentrations of various ECM proteins and blocked with 1% BSA. After attachment and spreading of cells (1–1.5 h), the coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed for 15 min with 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min, and subsequently blocked with 1% BSA/PBS. Binding of first antibodies was performed for 1 h at room temperature and was detected by species-specific fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies as described (6Wixler V. Geerts D.

When transfected cells were used, they were plated on coverslips 24 h after transfection. Immunostaining of a 10-μm cryosection of muscle tissues was performed in the same manner. Tissues were taken from 8-week-old C57bl/6 mice and embedded in Tissue-Tec (Sakura Finetek, Zoeterwoude, The Netherlands) for cryosections. Fluorescence was monitored with a Zeiss Axioplan-2 microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany). Cell images were taken using a Hamamutsu digital camera and OpenLab Systems software (Improvision). Confocal images were generated with Leica DMR (Leica, Deerfield, IL) software, version 2.00. GST Coprecipitation Assays and Immunoblotting—2 × 105 HEK293 cells were plated on 6-well dishes 48 h before transfection, which was performed using Superfect™ transfection reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 1 μg of each cDNA plasmid was used per transfection, and the total amount (2 μg/well) was equalized if necessary with appropriate empty expression vectors. 30 h later, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in IP buffer (137 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100) supplemented with 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml aprotinin at room temperature for 10 min. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose beads for GST pull-down analyses. The beads were subsequently washed two times with IP buffer. To reduce any nonspecific binding of proteins, Sepharose beads were blocked with 1% BSA in IP buffer before incubation with cell lysates. Samples were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, followed by electroblotting onto nitrocellulose membrane. The specific detection of proteins was performed with appropriate first antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Cell Attachment and Migration Assays—Attachment assays were performed as described elsewhere (33Echtermeyer F. Schober S. Poschl E. von der Mark H. von der Mark K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2071-2075Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Briefly, 96-well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with different concentrations of laminin-1 or fibronectin and blocked thereafter with 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature. Wells coated with only BSA served as negative controls. Cells were trypsinized and washed once in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA, and 5 × 104 cells were added in 50 μl of DMEM with 0.5% BSA into each well. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, cells were washed three times with PBS using an automatic washer, and the amount of attached cells was measured by acidic phosphatase activity. Cell migration studies were performed mainly as described in Ref. 35Lavrovskii V.A. Razvorotnev V.A. Tsitologiia. 1976; 18: 113-116PubMed Google Scholar. Briefly, 48-well plates were coated with laminin-1 or fibronectin and blocked with 1% BSA, and 105 cells in 0.5 ml of DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum were plated into each well. To produce a cell-free “window,” a 0.6-mm thick steel plate was inserted into wells before seeding of cells and they were removed again after the cells have been attached to the bottom. This method has the advantage over the frequently used “scratch window” assay in that the substrate in the “window” is not destroyed. The migration was monitored by inverted microscopy at the times shown. Purification of Extracellular Matrix Proteins—Murine laminin-1 was purified from the Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm tumor as described in Ref. 36Paulsson M. Aumailley M. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Beck K. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 11-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar. Human fibronectin was isolated from freshly frozen plasma according to Vuento et al. (37Vuento M. Vaheri A. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Human vitronectin was purified from human plasma by heparin affinity chromatography according to the method of Yatohgo et al. (38Yatohgo T. Izumi M. Kashiwagi H. Hayashi M. Cell Struct. Funct. 1988; 13: 281-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). Rat tail collagen-1 was purchased from Roche Applied Science. The quality of purified proteins was verified by analyses of silver-stained polyacrylamide gels and by immunoblotting with appropriate specific antibodies. Only samples with no sign of degradation were used. Identification of FHL2 and FHL3 as Novel Interaction Partners of α7A and α7B Integrin Subunits—To understand the functional properties of the muscle integrin receptor α7β1, we searched for proteins binding to the different cytosolic splicing variants of the α-chain. The cytoplasmic part of α7A (aa 1104–1161) and α7B (aa 1104–1171) were fused to GAL4-BD and used as “bait” in two independent yeast two-hybrid screens. A human placenta cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain (GAL4-AD) was used as a “prey” protein source. Two related members of the FHL protein subclass were isolated from the α7A screen. Of 288 analyzed clones, 189 coded for FHL2 (also known as SLIM3 or DRAL), and one coded for FHL3 (alternative name SLIM2). In the α7B screen, 2 of 31 positive clones also coded for FHL2. A direct yeast two-hybrid binding assay showed that both α7A and α7B integrin splicing variants specifically interacted with FHL2 and FHL3 but not with the GAL4-AD alone. Quantification of β-galactosidase activity further showed that α7A/FHL2 binding is stronger than that of others and that α7/FHL interactions are several times weaker than that of p53/SV40 large T-antigen interaction, which was used as positive control (Fig. 1A). Our data also confirmed the already published transactivation property of FHL3 alone (30Müller J.M. Metzger E. Greschik H. Bosserhoff A.K. Mercep L. Buettner R. Schüle R. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 736-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar, 39Fimia G.M. De Cesare D. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8613-8622Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). A surprising situation was noticed for the binding to the α7B cytoplasmic domain, since only a truncated form of the receptor lacking the 9 COOH-terminal amino acids showed an interaction with FHL2 and FHL3 but not the complete α7B cytodomain (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained with several other α7B-interacting proteins, and we were not able to identify any α7B-binding proteins while screening placenta or heart cDNA libraries with the complete α7B cytodomain. The inhibitory effect of the full-length α7B cytosolic domain will be discussed later. The specificity of interactions was confirmed in experiments with mammalian cells. Myc-tagged FHL2 and FHL3 proteins could be coprecipitated with GST-tagged α7A cytoplasmic domain, when these chimeric proteins were coexpressed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of the observed bindings was clearly visible (Fig. 1B, upper panel, lanes 4 and 5) despite a weak binding of FHL proteins to glutathione-Sepharose beads (lanes 2 and 3). In a reciprocal pull-down assay with GST-tagged FHL2 and FHL3, we were able to coprecipitate the α7B integrin molecule consisting of the cytoplasmic and extracellular domains (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5). Fig. 2A shows that both α7β1 integrin receptor and FHL2 and FHL3 proteins are expressed in myoblasts as well as in muscle tissues. However, the coprecipitation of endogenously expressed α7β1 integrin and FHL proteins has been proved to be difficult, regardless of cell or tissue type we used (C2C12 myoblasts, skeletal or heart muscle) or lysis conditions we tried. We therefore analyzed the interaction of endogenous FHL proteins and α7 integrin subunit with immunofluorescence technique in cells under conditions where the α7β1 integrin receptor was functionally active. For this purpose, we used C2C12 mouse myoblasts, which endogenously express FHL2, FHL3, and the integrin α7B subunit as a heterodimer with the β1A (Fig. 2A and Ref. 40van der Flier A. Gaspar A.C. Thorsteinsdottir S. Baudoin C. Groeneveld E. Mummery C.L. Sonnenberg A. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 472-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The cells were plated on laminin-1, a substrate for α7β1 integrin (41von der Mark H. Williams I. Wendler O. Sorokin L. von der Mark K. Poschl E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6012-6016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The α7-specific monoclonal 3C12 antibody showed that the integrin receptor was preferentially localized at focal adhesion sites (Fig. 2B, left panel in red). The rabbit polyclonal antibodies to both FHL2 and FHL3 revealed mainly the same immunostaining expression pattern (middle panel in green), and the merged images (right panel) demonstrated a colocalization of FHL2 and FHL3 with the integrin α7B subunit.Fig. 2Colocalization of FHL2 and FHL3 proteins with the muscle α7β1 integrin receptor in myoblasts and skeletal muscles.A, C2C12 radioimmune precipitation assay buffer lysate and tissue samples lysed in reducing loading buffer were separated on a 10% acrylamide gel. For detection of integrin subunits, 20 μg of protein lysates were loaded. For revealing of FHL2, 10 μg of C2C12 protein and 30 μg of tissue protein were loaded, whereas for detection of FHL3, 20 and 60 μg, respectively, were used. B, C2C12 cells were set on"
https://openalex.org/W2086095680,"Amplification of the N-myc proto-oncogene signifies aggressive behavior in human neuroblastoma. Likewise, overexpression of the intermediate filament nestin, a neuroectodermal stem cell marker, is linked to increased aggressiveness in several nervous system tumors. We investigated the interaction of these two proteins in human neuroblastoma cells. Neuroblastic cell variants with high levels of N-Myc protein have significantly higher nestin protein levels than non-amplified cell lines, suggesting that the transcription factor N-Myc may regulate nestin expression. Stable transfection of a nestin antisense sequence into neuroblastic, N-myc-amplified, LA1-55n cells results in a 2-fold reduction in nestin protein without altering N-Myc expression. However, cell functions attributed to N-Myc (growth rate, anchorage-independent growth, and motility) all decrease significantly. Transfection studies that modulate N-Myc levels also result in commensurate changes in nestin mRNA and protein amounts as well as in cell proliferation and motility. Thus, nestin appears to be downstream of and regulated by N-Myc. Gel mobility shift assays show that N-Myc binds specifically to E-box sequences in the regulatory second intron of the nestin gene and nuclear run-off studies show that increases in N-Myc protein up-regulate nestin transcription rate. Subcellular fractionation and immunoblot studies indicate that nestin is present in the nucleus as well as in the cytoplasm of neuroblastoma cell lines. Finally, DNA cross-linking experiments show that nestin binds DNA in N-myc-amplified N-type cell lines. Thus, nestin may be one mediator of N-myc-associated tumor aggressiveness of human neuroblastoma."

Lichtenstein L.M. Schleimer R.P. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 410-418PubMed Google Scholar), by adhesion molecule expression (14Atsuta J. Sterbinsky S.A. Plitt J. Schwiebert L.M. Bochner B.S.

CCL5 may be secreted by pulmonary epithelial cells in response to proinflammatory cytokines (5Berkman N. Robichaud A. Krishnan V.L. Roesems G. Robbins R. Jose P.J. Barnes P.J. Chung K.F.

Takeshita I. Maruoka S. Horie T. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2000; 162: 1075-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), or pathogens such as RSV (19Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S.F. Sharland M. Becker S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1007-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 20Noah T.L. Becker S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L472-L478PubMed Google Scholar). However, virulent M. tuberculosis, strain H37-Rv, which stimulates epithelial cell CXCL8 (IL-8) secretion (21Wickremasinghe M.I. Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3936-3947PubMed Google Scholar), does not cause CCL5 release (22Lin Y. Zhang M. Barnes P.F. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1121-1126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) despite invasion and replication of the pathogen within alveolar epithelial cells (23Bermudez L.E. Goodman J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 1400-1406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, direct infection of alveolar macrophages, monocytes, or epithelial cells by tuberculosis cannot explain the source of CCL5 detected in the BALF of patients with tuberculosis. We hypothesized that cellular networks between lung epithelium and monocytes involving proinflammatory cytokines were central to CCL5 secretion in pulmonary tuberculosis. Monocyte-derived IL-1β may be critical in such networks as polymorphisms in the IL-1 locus can affect relative IL-1β and IL-1ra monocyte responses to M. tuberculosis (24Wilkinson R. Patel P. Llewelyn M. Hirsch C.S. Pasvol G. Snounou G. Davidson R. Toossi Z. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 12: 1863-1873Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and IL-1β and IL-1ra imbalances may affect outcomes of chronic diseases (25Horai R. Saijo S. Akae S. Okahara A. Ikuse T. Iwakura Y. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The mechanisms regulating CCL5 secretion in lung epithelium are not completely understood but may be cell type- and stimulus-specific. Transcriptional regulation of the CCL5 gene is critical in T lymphocytes (1Schall T.J. Jongstra J. Dyer B.J. Jorgensen J. Clayberger C. Davis M.M. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 1018-1025PubMed Google Scholar, 2Schall T.J. Bacon K. Toy K.J. Goeddel D.V. Nature. 1990; 347: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (1252) Google Scholar, 26Nelson P.J. Kim H.T.

The CCL5 promoter contains response elements for the transcriptional activators NFκB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 (26Nelson P.J. Kim H.T. Manning W.C. Goralski T.J. Krensky A.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 2601-2612PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar) and for late acting factors restricted to T cells (28Song A. Chen Y. Thamatrakoln K. Storm T. Krensky A. Immunity. 1999; 10: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). NFκB comprises a family of Rel-related proteins retained in the cytoplasm bound to the inhibitor IκBα and is a pivotal regulator of proinflammatory responses (29Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2910) Google Scholar). Following cellular activation, IκBα is phosphorylated on specific serine residues (30Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1307) Google Scholar), ubiquitinated, and degraded (31Henkel T. Machleidt T. Alkalay I. Kronke M. Ben Neriah Y. Baeuerle P. Nature. 1993; 365: 182-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar), allowing NFκB to pass into the nucleus where binding to CCL5 κB binding sites may occur. NF-IL-6, originally identified as a nuclear factor binding to an IL-1-response element in the human IL-6 gene, and the AP-1 complex, comprised of Jun/Fos heterodimers or Jun/Jun homodimers, are other key regulators in cytokine gene expression (32Isshiki H. Akira S. Tanabe O. Nakajima T. Shimamoto T. Hirano T. Kishimoto T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2757-2764Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 33Jamaluddin M. Garofalo R. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Foletta V.C. Segal D.H. Cohen D.R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 139-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). RSV-induced CCL5 gene expression in lung epithelium is associated with the nuclear translocation of NF-IL-6 (33Jamaluddin M. Garofalo R. Ogra P.L. Brasier A.R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1554-1563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, little data exists on the functional role of NF-IL-6 or AP-1 in cytokine-induced CCL5 gene activation, although NFκB may be required (16Ayad O. Stark J.S. Fielder M.M. Menendez I.Y. Ryan M.A. Wong H.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2594-2599PubMed Google Scholar, 27Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar, 35Manni A. Kleimberg J. Ackerman V. Bellini A. Patalano F. Mattoli S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 220: 120-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We demonstrate for the first time that pulmonary epithelial cells are an important source of CCL5 following in vitro infection of human monocytes by live, virulent M. tuberculosis. The stimulus for CCL5 secretion is IL-1β, released after monocyte infection by M. tuberculosis and not direct epithelial infection. Such CCL5 secretion required new gene transcription and translocation of NFκB subunits p50, p65, and c-rel to the nucleus of human primary alveolar epithelium. Promoter-reporter analysis of the CCL5 gene demonstrated that NFκB, AP-1, and NF-IL-6 binding was involved in cytokine-stimulated CCL5 gene transcription in pulmonary epithelium together with a distal region of the promoter not identified previously as a key regulatory site. Primary pulmonary epithelial CCL5, but not CXCL8, secretion was differentially responsive to the monocyte-derived IL-1β depending on the origin of the epithelium. Primary alveolar epithelium of the distal airways secreted CCL5 in response to the monocyte-derived IL-1β, but the upper airway cells of the trachea and main bronchi did not. Thus, the observed networking effects causing CCL5 secretion were due to monocyte-derived IL-1β acting on primary alveolar epithelium. Our data indicate that the vast distal alveolar epithelial cell surface is the major cellular source of CCL5 in pulmonary tuberculosis and that the mechanisms controlling this CCL5 gene expression depend on AP-1 and NF-IL-6 activation as well as NFκB. Human Epithelial Cell and Monocyte Culture—The human pulmonary type II alveolar epithelial A549 cell line (36Lieber M. Smith B. Szakal A. Nelson-Rees W. Todaro G. Int. J. Cancer. 1976; 17: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures 86012804) was maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (endotoxin < 0.02 ng/ml), 2 mm glutamine, and 10 mg/ml ampicillin (an antibiotic with no significant antimycobacterial activity at this concentration). SAEC and NHBE were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) as cryopreserved cells. They were regenerated and maintained according to the supplier's instructions. NHBE were maintained and seeded in bronchial epithelium growth medium containing 13 mg/ml bovine pituitary extract, 0.5 mg/ml hydrocortisone, 0.5 μg/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor, 0.5 mg/ml epinephrine, 10 mg/ml transferrin, 5 mg/ml insulin, 6.5 μg/ml triiodothyronine, 50 mg/ml gentamicin, 50 μg/ml amphotericin-B. Small airway epithelial growth medium contained the above but less bovine pituitary extract (7.5 mg/ml) and in addition 50 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free). The medium was changed every other day, and cells were subcultured when 60–80% confluent. To subculture, the medium was aspirated, and the monolayer was rinsed with Hanks' solution; trypsin/EDTA was added for 5 min and neutralized with trypsin-neutralizing solution. Centrifuged cells were resuspended in medium prior to cell counting and seeding. Cells were discarded after 15 population doublings. Human monocytes were prepared from pooled buffy coats (North Thames Blood Transfusion Service, Colindale, UK) by density gradient centrifugation on a Ficoll-Paque (Amersham Biosciences). The monocytes were purified by adhesion to tissue culture plastic for 2 h and maintained in RPMI 1640. Mycobacterial Culture—The virulent strain of M. tuberculosis, H37-Rv (National Collection of Type Cultures, Colindale, UK), was maintained in enriched Dubos medium (Difco). Before use, 1 ml of a mid-logarithmic phase mycobacterial suspension was sonicated (20 s) and left to stand for 10 min, and the top 750 μl was used, thus generating single cell mycobacterial suspensions (confirmed by modified Kinyoun staining). Viable mycobacteria were quantitated by colony counting in triplicate on Middlebrook 7H10 plates. Epithelial Cell and Monocyte Stimulation—Monocytes were infected with M. tuberculosis (MOI 10) or left unstimulated for 24 h, and the conditioned medium, CoMTB or CoMControl, respectively, was harvested and stored at -70 °C. Epithelial cells were exposed to M. tuberculosis (MOI 10), CoMTB (at dilutions of 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 in appropriate serum-free medium), CoMControl, or TNFα (20 ng/ml) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ). In experiments involving IL-1ra (37Levine S.J. Wu T. Shelhamer J.H. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5949-5957PubMed Google Scholar) (Peprotech), epithelial cells were preincubated for 2 h at 37 °C prior to use, and in those involving neutralizing anti-TNF antibody (Peprotech), CoMTB was preincubated with the antibody for 1 h at 37 °C prior to use. We confirmed previously that 50 μg/ml anti-TNF neutralizes activity of 10 ng/ml TNFα (21Wickremasinghe M.I. Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 3936-3947PubMed Google Scholar). RNA Extraction and Northern Blotting—Epithelial cells were homogenized in RNA extraction buffer (4 mm guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, and 0.1 m 2-mercaptoethanol), and RNA extraction was performed using a modified guanidium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction method (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar, 39Friedland J.S. Remick D.G. Shattock R. Griffin G.E. Eur. J. Immunol. 1992; 22: 1373-1378Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). 20-μg RNA aliquots were run on denaturing formaldehyde-1% agarose gels, transferred by capillary blotting to Hybond-N, and UV-fixed (UV Stratalinker™ 1800, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Blots were prehybridized and hybridized with a γ-32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide probe mixture for CCL5 (BPR246, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and later a β-actin 42-mer probe (40Strieter R.M. Kunkel S.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.G. Phan S.H. Ward P.A. Marks R.M. Science. 1989; 243: 1467-1469Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Blots were autoradiographed, and images were digitized (Umax, Power Look II) and analyzed with NIH Image 1.52 (from National Institutes of Health Research Services Branch, Betheseda, MD). CCL5 signal densitometry was normalized for total RNA loading using β-actin mRNA densitometry. Cytokine Assays—CCL5 or IL-1β (R&D Systems) was assayed in cell culture supernatants by ELISA. The lower limit of sensitivity was 15 pg/ml for the CCL5 assay and 7.8 pg/ml for the IL-1β assay. CCL5 concentrations are expressed in pg/106 cells, and IL-1β concentrations are expressed as ng/ml. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Nuclear extracts were prepared using a modified version of an established protocol (41Durand D.B. Shaw J.P. Bush M.R. Replogle R.E. Belagaje R. Neilson E.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1715-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Following stimulation, cells were washed with cytoplasmic extraction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing protease inhibitors and with 0.15% Nonidet P-40 added. After centrifugation (500 × g), the nuclear pellet was resuspended in nuclear extract buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 400 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1.5 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), incubated on ice, and recentrifuged. The protein was quantitated by Bradford assay (42Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). 5 μg of nuclear extract was mixed with 0.7 ng of γ-32P-end-labeled double stranded DNA probe with specific activity greater than 1 × 108 cpm/μg in DNA binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 3 mg of poly(dI-dC), and 5% glycerol) and was resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels. The oligonucleotides contained the consensus sequence corresponding to the NFκB (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′), AP-1 (5′-CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC-3′), or NF-IL-6 (5′-TGCAGATTGTGCAATGTACG-3′) binding sites (43Mastronarde J.G. Monick M.M. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Hunninghake G.W. J. Infect. Dis. 1998; 177: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Consensus sequences allow concurrent investigation of the four different NFκB binding sites and the four TPA-response elements. Dried gels were autoradiographed at -70 °C overnight. Binding specificity was demonstrated by competition assays using a 10-fold excess of unlabeled probe and by failure to compete out the signal with an excess of unlabeled, irrelevant probe. For supershift assays, 1 μg of antibodies either to the NFκB subunits p50, p52, p65, Rel B, and c-rel or to c-Fos (a subunit of the unrelated transcription factor AP-1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the binding mix before electrophoresis. ELISA-based Transcription Factor Assay—To investigate the complex binding of the multiple subunits of AP-1, a transcription factor ELISA-based assay (TransAM™, Active Motif North America, Carlsbad, CA), which is 5-fold more sensitive than EMSA, was performed. Nuclear extracts were added to a 96-well plate containing immobilized oligonucleotides including a TPA-responsive element (TRE, 5′-TGAGTCA-3′). AP-1 dimers in the nuclear extract bind to this TPA-responsive element and were detected using antibodies against c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2, c-Jun, JunB, or JunD. A secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase was added, and the color change was detected by spectrophotometry at 450 nm. Competition experiments demonstrated specificity of binding by adding 20 pmol/well either wild type or mutated AP-1 oligonucleotide before assaying with the c-Fos antibody. Western Blotting and SDS-PAGE—Cells were lysed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm VaS04, 170 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors as described previously (19Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S.F. Sharland M. Becker S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1007-1016PubMed Google Scholar). Lysates were centrifuged (800 × g), the supernatant was removed, and loading buffer (10% glycerol, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and bromphenol blue) was added. Samples were boiled, separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were blocked and incubated at 4 °C with 1 μg/ml rabbit anti-human IκBα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, bands were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and film. Transfections and Luciferase Assays—Promoter-reporter constructs of the 5′-flanking region of the CCL5 gene were used (generous gift of Dr. William Reed, Environmental Protection Agency, Chapel Hill, NC). One construct contained the full-length (-961) WT CCL5 promoter containing four NFκB, four AP-1 (TRE), and one NF-IL-6 binding site(s) (Fig. 5). The remaining constructs had been truncated by serial deletions (at -737, -421, -181, and -79). The -421 construct deleted the distal (-579) CD28/NFκB site. The -181 construct deleted all TPA-response elements and a NFκB binding site of low affinity (-231); the -79 construct deleted the NF-IL-6 site but retained two NFκB binding sites at positions -30 and -44 (19Thomas L.H. Friedland J.S.F. Sharland M. Becker S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1007-1016PubMed Google Scholar, 20Noah T.L. Becker S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L472-L478PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs containing site-specific mutations were the very generous gift of Professor Hiroyuki Moriuchi, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki, Japan. These constructs contained mutations of the -κB1 (-44), -κB2 (-30), NF-IL-6 (-92), TRE1/2 (-345), TRE3/4 (-327), TRE1/2/3/4, and CD28RE/κB2/κB1 (-579, -44, -30) sites as described previously (27Moriuchi H. Moriuchi M. Fauci A.S. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar). Constructs had been inserted into the firefly luciferase expression plasmid PGL2-basic. A549 cells were co-transfected using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Applied Science) with 4 μg of a CCL5 reporter plasmid and 0.08 μg of a control reporter plasmid, PRL-TK, constitutively expressing low level Renilla luciferase. Following cell stimulation, luciferase activity of extracts was measured using the Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) with a luminometer (Bio-Orbit 1253, Labtech International, East Sussex, UK). Renilla luciferase activity was used to normalize firefly activity to control for transfection efficiency. Effect of CoMTB on CCL5 Secretion from Pulmonary Epithelial Cells Compared with Effects of Direct Infection by M. tuberculosis—CoMTB was used to stimulate A549 cells over 24 h at dilutions of 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000 in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. A549 cells stimulated with CoMTB (1:10) secreted 20,342 ± 2142 pg of CCL5/106 cells within 4 h and 53,250 ± 2696 pg of CCL5/106 cells after 24 h (Fig. 1A). Such CoMTB-induced CCL5 secretion at 24 h was 12-fold greater than from tuberculosis-infected human monocytes, which as expected secreted only 4310 ± 816 pg of CCL5/106 cells at 24 h (Fig. 1B). A549 cells directly infected by M. tuberculosis (MOI of 10, causing no significant cytotoxicity (44McDonough K.A. Kress Y. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4802-4811Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) did not release CCL5 unlike the positive control TNFα (Fig. 1C). To confirm our findings with CoMTB in primary cells, NHBE were stimulated with CoMTB, but no CCL5 release was detected. Because tuberculosis is primarily an infection of the alveolar airway, we investigated the effect of CoMTB on SAEC, which are harvested from terminal bronchi of 2-mm diameter and below including alveoli consisting of type I and II pneumocytes. In contrast to NHBE, SAEC stimulated with CoMTB did secrete significant CCL5 at concentrations of 809 ± 141 pg/106 cells (Fig. 1D), suggesting a differential responsiveness of upper and lower airway epithelium to CoMTB. For this reason, further experiments focused on distal airway cells. The finding that lower but not upper airway epithelial cells respond to CoMTB by secreting CCL5 appears specific. Thus, both NHBE and SAEC stimulated with CoMTB secrete CXCL8, although the magnitude of the response in the two cell types is different (Fig. 1E). CXCL8 secretion after CoMTB stimulation increased from background levels (because of monocyte-derived CXCL8 in CoMTB) to 16,911 ± 3381 pg/106 NHBE. This was over 3.5-fold greater than that found in NHBE after stimulation for 24 h with CoMControl. The absolute concentration of CoMTB-induced CXCL8 secretion from lower airway epithelial cells was higher at 57,004 ± 325 pg/106 SAEC, although this represented just a 4.5-fold increase compared with CoMControl at 24 h. CoMTB Induces Early CCL5 mRNA Accumulation in A549 Cells—Northern analysis demonstrated CCL5 mRNA accumulation by 2 h, peaking at 8 h and present at 24 h post-CoMTB stimulation of A549 cells (Fig. 2A), with none seen in controls (Fig. 2B). These kinetics are consistent with those for the CCL5 protein secretion. CoMTB exhibited a dose-response effect in stimulating CCL5 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2C) demonstrating that even at a dilution of 1:100 the CoMTB was capable of inducing significant CCL5 mRNA up-regulation at 24 h. This is consistent with the observed dose-response effect of CoMTB on CCL5 secretion (Fig. 1A). Activation of NFκB and Degradation of IκBα in CoMTB-stimulated A549 Cells—The role of NFκB in the control of CCL5 gene expression in pulmonary epithelial cells was analyzed by EMSA. Cell nu"

The membrane-associated transporter consists of two transmembrane subunits, MalF and MalG, and two copies of the cytoplasmic ATP-binding cassette subunit, MalK. Maltose-binding protein (MBP), a soluble periplasmic protein, delivers maltose to the MalFGK2 transporter and stimulates hydrolysis by the transporter. Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to monitor binding of MBP to MalFGK2 and conformational changes in MBP as it interacts with MalFGK2. Cysteine residues and spin labels have been introduced into the two lobes of MBP so that spin-spin interaction will report on ligand-induced closure of the protein (Hall, J. A., Thorgeirsson, T. E., Liu, J., Shin, Y. K., and Nikaido, H. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17610–17614). At least two different modes of interaction between MBP and MalFGK2 were detected. Binding of MBP to MalFGK2 in the absence of ATP resulted in a decrease in motion of spin label at position 41 in the C-terminal domain of MBP. In a vanadate-trapped transition state intermediate, all free MBP became tightly bound to MalFGK2, spin label in both lobes became completely immobilized, and spin-spin interactions were lost, suggesting that MBP was in an open conformation. Binding of non-hydrolyzable MgATP analogs or ATP in the absence of Mg is sufficient to stabilize a complex of open MBP and MalFGK2. Taken together, these data suggest that closure of the MalK dimer interface coincides with opening of MBP and maltose release to the transporter.

The class of proteins termed ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; MSD, membrane-spanning domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Vi, vanadate; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate; DM, n-dodecyl β-d maltoside; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. 1The abbreviations used are: ABC, ATP-binding cassette; NBD, nucleotide binding domain; MSD, membrane-spanning domain; MBP, maltose-binding protein; Vi, vanadate; SDSL, site-directed spin labeling; EPR, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy; MTSL, (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate; DM, n-dodecyl β-d maltoside; ATPγS, adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate); AMP-PNP, adenylyl-imidodiphosphate; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator. is one of the largest found in nature. Their capacity to move a variety of substances across a membrane using energy from the cell is fundamentally important to bacterial physiology and multidrug resistance in addition to an array of human pathologies such as cystic fibrosis, hyperinsulinemia, and macular dystrophy (1Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1486) Google Scholar). Transport is powered by the well-conserved ABC or nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), whereas the specificity for substrate exists in the highly divergent associated membrane-spanning domains (MSDs). Uptake of nutrients into bacterial cells relies on binding protein-dependent transport systems that belong to the ABC transporter family (2Ames G.F. Mimura C.S. Shyamala V. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1990; 6: 429-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L. Lin E.C.C. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Reznikoff W.S. Riley M. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). As a model for ABC transporters, we study the well-characterized maltose transport system of Escherichia coli (4Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 1225-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The transport complex (FGK2) consists of two membrane-spanning subunits, MalF and MalG, likely consisting of bundles of eight and six α-helices, respectively (5Froshauer S. Green G.N. Boyd D. McGovern K. Beckwith J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 200: 501-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 6Dassa E. Muir S. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 7: 29-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and two copies of the cytoplasmic NBD subunit, MalK (7Davidson A.L. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8946-8951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After maltose diffuses into the periplasm through outer membrane porins (8Szmelcman S. Hofnung M. J. Bacteriol. 1975; 124: 112-118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is bound with high affinity by maltose-binding protein (MBP) (9Kellerman O. Szmelcman S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 47: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). MBP, in addition to functioning as a maltose receptor, stimulates ATP hydrolysis by the transporter (10Davidson A.L. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2360-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanism of transport, intermediates in the transport pathway have been stabilized and characterized. Vanadate (Vi), an inorganic phosphate analog that mimics the transition state of the γ-phosphate of ATP during hydrolysis (11Smith C.A. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5404-5417Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar), has been used to trap the transporter in the transition state conformation (12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the vanadate-trapped transition state, MBP is tightly bound to the transport complex, and high affinity binding to maltose is lost (13Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, we propose that MBP stimulates the ATPase activity of the transporter by stabilizing the transition state and that attainment of the transition state is coupled to the loss of high affinity for maltose, thereby coupling maltose transport to ATP hydrolysis (13Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In our current model for maltose transport (Fig. 1), we suggest that maltose-bound MBP in the closed conformation interacts with the transporter in the “periplasmic-closed” (P-closed) state, where access to the translocation pathway from the periplasm is blocked. In the transition state, a concerted conformational change to a “periplasmic-open” (P-open) state occurs in which the nucleotide-binding domains of the MalK subunits have associated to complete the ATP-binding sites, membrane-spanning helices have reoriented to alternate the access to a central binding site in the translocation pathway from the cytoplasm to the periplasm, and MBP has opened to release maltose into the transporter. After ATP hydrolysis, the transporter returns to the P-closed state. Site-directed spin labeling (SDSL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy are powerful tools that can provide a great deal of information on the location and environment of an individual residue within a very large and complex protein structure (14Klug C.S. Feix J.B. Berliner L.J. Eaton S.S. Eaton G.R. Biological Magnetic Resonance. 24. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, Hingham, MA2004: 269-308Google Scholar, 15Hubbell W.L. Gross A. Langen R. Lietzow M.A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 16Hubbell W.L. Cafiso D.S. Altenbach C. Nat. Struct.

Unlike other methods that allow only the monitoring of global changes in protein structure, SDSL allows the direct probing of the local environment, structure, and proximity of individual residues. SDSL typically involves introducing a specifically placed cysteine residue within a protein followed by a reaction with a sulfhydryl-specific nitroxide spin label. Conformational changes in protein structure can be observed through both solvent accessibility measurements and motional changes of the introduced spin label side chain. That is, conformational changes due to substrate binding; membrane binding; secondary, tertiary, and protein-protein interactions; denaturation; and other perturbations are all evident in the EPR spectra and can give key information on structural changes at specific sites. In addition, the observation of alterations in distance between sites upon ligand binding or protein-protein interaction is a powerful approach to characterizing conformational changes (18Rabenstein M.D. Shin Y.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8239-8243Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 19Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The EPR spectroscopy technique has the unique ability to address and answer questions not solvable by genetic and crystal structure analysis. In this report, we use SDSL and EPR to study the dynamics of MBP as it interacts with the maltose transporter during nucleotide binding and ATP hydrolysis. Our findings show that MBP is open in the transition state and offer further support for the model presented in Fig. 1. Mutagenesis and Cloning of MBP—Wild-type MBP with a C-terminal polyhistidine tag was generated by PCR amplification of the malE gene from the pJF2 plasmid (20Fikes J.D. Bassford Jr., P.J. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 2352-2359Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the MalEC4His primer (5′-GGCCCAAGCTTAGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGGTGACT-3′) and the R1lacUV5 primer (5′-CCGGGAATTCGCTCACTCATTAGGCACC-3′). The resulting fragment was cloned into pCR 4blunt-TOPO plasmid (which contains a tac promoter) in TOP 10F′ cells using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR cloning kit (Invitrogen). MBP mutants S211C, D41C, and D41C/S211C were generated by PCR amplification of malE from pJH1, pJH2, and pJH3, all generously given to us by the laboratory of Dr. Hiroshi Nikaido. The MalEC4His primer and the MalE reverse primer (5′-AAAAGGATCCTATCTTTCGATACCACGACC-3′) were used. The PCR product was TOPO cloned into the pCR 4blunt-TOPO plasmid in TOP 10F′ cells as described above. Purification of MBP and Spin Labeling—His-tagged MBP D41C, S211C, and D41C/S211C were overexpressed in TOP 10F′ cells. Protein expression was induced by addition of 100 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Production of MBP with a polyhistidine tag allowed purification on a cobalt affinity resin (Clontech) to >99% purity. MBP was released from the periplasm by Tris-lysozyme-EDTA treatment (21Witholt B. Boekhout M. Brock M. Kingma J. van Heerikhuizen H. de Leij L. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 74: 160-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) as follows. After overnight growth, cells were spun down and resuspended in 10 ml of 200 mm Tris, pH 8. Then, 10 ml of Tris-sucrose (200 mm Tris, pH 8, and 34% sucrose) were added, followed by 200 μlof a 10 mg/ml lysozyme solution and 50 μl of 0.5 mm EDTA. Water (20 ml) was added, and the mixture was allowed to sit for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by addition of 800 μl of 1 m MgSO4. The periplasmic contents were collected by spinning down the spheroplasts at 8000 × g. EDTA was removed by dialysis, and the proteins were bound to the cobalt resin in 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer. The affinity resin was washed with Buffer A (20 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl) and eluted with Buffer B (20 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 150 mm imidazole). Immediately after elution, the proteins were reacted with a 10-fold (for the single mutants) or 20-fold (for the double mutant) molar excess of the spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-Δ3-pyrroline-3-methyl)-methanethiosulfonate (MTSL) (Toronto Research Chemicals) overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Extensive dialysis was used to remove unreacted spin label. Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically by using an extinction coefficient of 1.7 ( (ϵ1 cm0.1%)) (22Gehring K. Williams P.G. Pelton J.G. Morimoto H. Wemmer D.E. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Purification of FGK2—Polyhistidine-tagged maltose transport complex (FGK2) was overexpressed and purified in E. coli as described previously (12Sharma S. Davidson A.L. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6570-6576Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes solubilized by addition of 1% n-dodecyl β-d maltoside (DM) were bound to cobalt affinity resin preequilibrated in Buffer C (0.01% DM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl). The resin was washed with Buffer C, and protein was eluted with Buffer D (150 mm imidazole, 0.01% DM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Schaffner and Weissmann (23Schaffner W. Weissmann C. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 56: 502-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). Sample Conditions for EPR Spectroscopy—The following conditions were used to obtain EPR spectra of the spin-labeled MBP mutants: (a) MBP alone, 100 μm MBP; (b) MBP + maltose, 90 μm MBP and 1 mm maltose; (c) MBP + FGK2 + maltose, 50 μm MBP, 100 μm FGK2, and 1 mm maltose; (d) MBP + FGK2 + maltose + ATP + EDTA, 43 μm MBP, 86 μm FGK2, 0.86 mm maltose, 20 mm ATP, and 1 mm EDTA; (e) MBP + FGK2 + maltose + ATPγS (or AMP-PNP; both from Roche Diagnostics) + Mg2+, 43 μm MBP, 86 μm FGK2, 0.86 mm maltose, 20 mm ATPγS (or AMP-PNP), and 20 mm MgCl2; (f) MBP + FGK2 + maltose + ATP + EDTA + Mg2+, 42 μm MBP, 84 μm FGK2, 0.84 mm maltose, 20 mm ATP, 1mm EDTA, and 20 mm MgCl2; and (g) MBP + FGK2 + maltose + ATP + Mg2+ + NaVi, 42 μm MBP, 84 μm FGK2, 0.84 mm maltose, 20 mm ATP, 20 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm NaVi. Reactions with MBP alone were done in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8. Those that included the transport complex were done in 0.01% DM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, and 10% glycerol buffer. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band EPR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker ELEXSYS E500 fitted with a Super High Q cavity. Samples were typically 25 μl and contained in a glass capillary. The spectra were normally signal averaged nine times with a scan time of 42 s and recorded at 10 mW microwave power over either a 100- or 200-G scan width. Distance measurements between the two spin label side chains were obtained using simulation software kindly provided by Dr. Christian Altenbach (19Altenbach C. Oh K.J. Trabanino R.J. Hideg K. Hubbell W.L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15471-15482Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Because the sum of the singles spectrum represented a slightly different conformation than that seen in the doubles spectrum, the use of a 3:1 mixture of diamagnetic (N-acetylated MTSL analog) to paramagnetic spin label (MTSL) was necessary and served as the sum of the singles for distance analysis. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Wild-type MBP (50 μm) was incubated with 100 μm FGK2 and 1 mm maltose to a final volume of 55 μl. In a second reaction consisting of the same components, 0.2 mm EDTA and 1 mm ATP were added. The samples were applied to a G3000 TSK-GEL size-exclusion chromatography column (TOSOH) and eluted with running buffer (0.01% DM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 150 mm NaCl). For the sample with ATP + EDTA, the running buffer had 1 mm ATP and 0.2 mm EDTA. Fractions were collected and visualized by silver staining (24Heukeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) of an 11% SDS-PAGE gel. Trapping of [α-32P]ATP by FGK2—Three reactions were set up, containing 10 μm FGK2, 50 μm wild-type MBP, and 1 mm maltose. To the first reaction, [α-32P]ATP (1 mm) and EDTA (0.2 mm) were added. To the second reaction, [α-32P]ATP (1 mm) and Mg2+ (4 mm) were added, and to the third reaction, [α-32P]ATP (1 mm), Mg2+ (4 mm), and NaVi (1 mm) were added. The reactions were incubated for 20 min at 23 °C and then dialyzed in 0.01% DM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8, 10% glycerol, and 50 mm NaCl (plus 0.2 mm EDTA for the first reaction). The samples were counted in a scintillation counter, and the ratio of nucleotide to protein was calculated. The experiment was repeated twice, and very similar results were obtained. The concentration of ATP used was determined from the optical density of the sample at 258 nm, using an extinction coefficient of 15,400 m–1 cm–1. SDSL of MBP Sites 211 and 41 Suggests an Interaction with the Transporter—MBP functions as a high affinity maltose receptor for the maltose transport system (3Boos W. Lucht J.M. Neidhardt F.C.

ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1996: 1175-1209Google Scholar). Maltose binds in a cleft between the two lobes of MBP, causing them to swing together (Fig. 2). A potential interaction site of MBP with the transport complex is defined by mapping mutations that affect transport (25Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Sharff A.J. Rodseth L.E. Spurlino J.E. Quiocho F.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10657-10663Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar); they are mainly clustered on a single face, on either side of the sugar-binding cleft (Fig. 2B). Genetic suppressor experiments suggest that the lobe of MBP that contains the C terminus interacts with MalF and that the lobe of MBP that contains the N terminus interacts with MalG (25Treptow N.A. Shuman H.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 809-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 32Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. J. Mol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1752-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Residues Asp41 and Ser211 were previously used to monitor conformational changes in MBP on binding maltose and other ligands (34Hall J.A. Thorgeirsson T.E. Liu J. Shin Y.K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17610-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). They are both located on the surface of MBP, on opposite sides of the maltose-binding cleft, within the region believed to interact with the transporter (Fig. 2). When these sites are mutated to cysteine and modified with MTSL, the capacity of MBP to bind maltose and carry out maltose transport remains intact (34Hall J.A. Thorgeirsson T.E. Liu J. Shin Y.K. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17610-17614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Therefore, they represent good candidates to monitor binding of MBP to the transporter. The EPR spectra of the singly labeled MBP mutants D41C and S211C were recorded and are shown in Fig. 3. The mobility of the nitroxide spin label, arising mainly from side chain and backbone motion, can be determined from its spectrum. Fast motion of the spin label results in sharp spectral lines, whereas slow motion results in broad lines that have moved outward. The spectrum of the spin-labeled D41C mutant (Fig. 3A), consisting of three sharp peaks, revealed that the spin label is very mobile. Motion at position 211 is more restricted, as seen by the broader spectral lines (Fig. 3B). Residue 41 is located in a loop region and therefore would be predicted to have a high level of flexibility, whereas residue 211 is located within an α-helix, where its motion may be more restricted (30Spurlino J.C. Lu G.Y. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5202-5219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The addition of maltose to either mutant results in no significant changes in mobility of the spin label side chain, indicating that these sites are not within the maltose-binding pocket and that they are sufficiently surface-exposed so that their mobility is not affected by the conformational change occurring in MBP once maltose is bound. The first question addressed was whether an interaction between MBP and the transporter complex in the ground state (represented by ATP-free transporter) would be detected. The EPR sample concentrations of MBP and transporter were 50 and 100 μm, respectively, and because the Km for wild-type MBP in the transport reaction is between 25 and 100 μm (35Dean D.A. Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Manson M.D. Boos W. Bassford Jr., P.J. Rasmussen B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9727-9733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it was expected that a significant percentage of MBP molecules would bind the transporter. When the spectrum of the D41C mutant with transporter was compared with the spectrum of the D41C mutant alone (Fig. 3A), it was clear that addition of the transporter results in a two-component spectrum. The more mobile component appears to correspond to the unbound MBP, whereas the less mobile component corresponds to MBP bound to the transporter. Subtraction of the unbound MBP from the composite spectrum allowed us to estimate that 60% of MBP was bound to the transporter. Interestingly, no change in mobility is observed at position 211 upon addition of the transporter (Fig. 3B). Because maltose binding significantly changes the conformation of MBP, the interaction of maltose-free (open) MBP D41C was examined in Fig. 3C. Again, ∼60% of MBP was bound to the transporter, as determined by the emergence of a lower mobility component. The low affinity interaction between MBP and the ground state of the transporter (35Dean D.A. Hor L.I. Shuman H.A. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2033-2040Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) contrasts sharply with the extremely high affinity binding of MBP to the transporter in the vanadate-trapped transition state (13Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The spectra of the two singly labeled MBP mutants bound to the vanadate-trapped transporter are shown in Fig. 3, A and B. In contrast to the spectra of D41C and S211C with transporter in the absence of ATP, the peak corresponding to unbound MBP is gone, indicative of high affinity binding (transporter is present in 2-fold molar excess of MBP). The spin labels at positions 211 and 41 are both completely immobilized, suggesting that both residues are on located on the transporter-binding interface of the vanadate-trapped transition state intermediate. MBP Has Opened in the Transition State—In our model (Fig. 1), we suggest that closed, maltose-bound MBP interacts with the transporter to induce ATP hydrolysis (13Chen J. Sharma S. Quiocho F.A. Davidson A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1525-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Based on the tight binding of MBP to the transporter in the transition state and the loss of high affinity for maltose, we further suggest that both MBP and the periplasmic surface of the transporter (FGK2) have opened in the transition state, allowing maltose to be released directly into the transporter. To test these ideas, the doubly spin-labeled D41C/S211C mutant was used to measure changes in distance between the two lobes of MBP during the transport cycle. Comparison of the x-ray crystal structures of maltose-free and maltose-bound MBP reveals a change in distance from 24 Å (open) to 15 Å (closed) between the α carbons of these residues, which lie on opposite sides of the maltose-binding cleft of MBP (Fig. 2). Fig. 4 shows the spectra of the doubly spin-labeled D41C/S211C mutant. In a doubly labeled protein, the spectrum that is obtained is a composite of the spectra of the noninteracting single mutants, onto which is superimposed the spectrum that results from the interaction of the spins. The spin-spin interaction is dependent on the distance between the spin labels and results in a dipolar broadened spectrum. Underlabeling of protein, as in our case, will make visualization of the spectral broadening due to these interactions more difficult because not all spin labels are able to interact with another spin label. However, computer analysis of each spectrum (see “Experimental Procedures”) accounts for the noninteracting spins and reports only the distances between the interacting labels. In the absence of maltose, there is no spin-spin apparent interaction, which indicates that the labels are >20 Å apart. Addition of excess maltose resulted in the appearance of both the spin-spin interaction, indicating that the two lobes of MBP have closed, and changes in the mobility of the spin labels that were not seen in the singly labeled preparations (Fig. 4, A and B). From distance measurements, a distribution of distances between the two introduced spin labels in maltose-bound MBP was found to center around 7.5–9 Å. Addition of the transporter to maltose-bound MBP had little effect on the spin-spin interactions observed in the spectrum (Fig. 4A), suggesting that MBP is still closed when it interacts with the transporter in the initial steps of translocation (see “Discussion”). However, a loss of spin-spin interaction is observed when MBP is tightly bound to the vanadate-trapped transporter (Fig. 4, A and C), indicating that MBP is open in the catalytic transition state, as predicted in the model (Fig. 1). As observed with the single mutants, the spin labels in the double mutant are also immobilized in the transition state conformation. Surprisingly, using MBP D41C, we determined that whether MBP was in the open (maltose-free) or closed (maltose-bound) conformation had no effect on the affinity between MBP and FGK2 in the absence of ATP; there was ∼60% bound in both cases (Fig. 3C). To determine whether MBP is always closed when bound to the ATP-free transporter, the spectrum of doubly labeled MBP with FGK2 was obtained in the absence of maltose. In Fig. 4A, the spectrum of MBP D41C/S211C reveals motional changes, suggestive of binding without the emergence of substantial spin-spin interaction, although deconvolution of the spectrum with the simulation software revealed a small component that was closed, which was not present in the spectrum of unliganded MBP. These results suggest that binding to FGK2 did trigger closure of a small fraction of maltose-free MBP. ATP Binding Stabilizes the Open State of MBP—In the x-ray crystal structures of the isolated MalK subunits, ATP binding promotes association of the nucleotide-binding domains (37Chen J. Lu G. Lin J. Davidson A.L. Quiocho F.A. Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 651-661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of ATP was prevented by incubation with EDTA to chelate Mg2+, which is essential for ATPase activity. We hypothesized that ATP binding and subunit association would promote conformational changes in the intact transporter through the interaction between MalK and the MSDs. To stabilize the pre-hydrolysis ATP-bound state, doubly spin-labeled MBP D41C/S211C was incubated with transporter treated with ATP and EDTA (Fig. 5A).

Several animal hemoglobins have properties that cannot be readily explained in terms of their amino acid sequence and known atomic models of hemoglobin. Among these, fish hemoglobins are well known for their widely varying interactions with heterotropic effector molecules and pH sensitivity. Some fish hemoglobins are almost completely insensitive to pH (within physiological limits), whereas others show extremely low oxygen affinity under acid conditions, a phenomenon called the Root effect. X-ray crystal structures of Root effect hemoglobins have not, to date, provided convincing explanations of this effect. Sequence alignments have signally failed to pinpoint the residues involved, and site-directed mutagenesis has not yielded a human hemoglobin variant with this property. We have solved the crystal structure of tuna hemoglobin in the deoxy form at low and moderate pH and in the presence of carbon monoxide at high pH. A comparison of these models shows clear evidence for novel mechanisms of pH-dependent control of ligand affinity.

A comparison of these models shows clear evidence for novel mechanisms of pH-dependent control of ligand affinity. Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein of the blood, is the most thoroughly studied protein, with a research literature dating back well over 100 years. In 1904, Bohr discovered that the oxygen affinity of human Hb is depressed by the presence of carbon dioxide (1Bohr C. Hasselbalch K.A. Krogh A. Skand. Arch. Physiol. 1904; 16: 402-412Crossref Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The term “Bohr effect,” however, is now generally used to describe the change in oxygen affinity of Hb with pH (a concept not established until 1909 by S. P. L. Sørensen; Ref. 62Sørensen S.P.L. Biochem. Z. 1909; 21: 131-304Google Scholar). Human adult Hb (HbA) 1The abbreviations used are: HbA, human adult hemoglobin; IHP, inositol hexaphosphate. 1The abbreviations used are: HbA, human adult hemoglobin; IHP, inositol hexaphosphate. shows a progressive drop in oxygen affinity with pH under physiological conditions. A minimum is reached at about pH 6, below which oxygen affinity rises again (2Imai K. Allosteric Effects in Haemoglobin. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1982Google Scholar). This “acid Bohr effect” has no known biological role but may be related to the process of Hb degradation, which occurs in acid vacuoles. The “alkaline Bohr effect” plays an important role in modifying the oxygen affinity of Hb to increase oxygen uptake in the lungs and delivery in the tissues. A large body of research, occasionally marked by strident disagreements, is devoted to relating this effect to Hb structure (3Kilmartin J.V. Breen J.J. Roberts G.C. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hb exists in two principal forms, the T state and the R state, which are the preferred conformations of the protein in the absence and presence of heme ligands, respectively. Cooperative oxygen binding is the result of oxygen binding more tightly to the R state, pushing the allosteric equilibrium toward the R state and concomitantly increasing ligand affinity (15Perutz M.F. Nature. 1972; 237: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 16Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar, 17Perutz M.F. Wilkinson A.J. Paoli M. Dodson G.G. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 1-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Histidine 146β, the C-terminal residue of the β chains, forms a salt bridge with Asp-94 of the same subunit in T state human Hb but not in R state Hb. The change in pKa of the histidine with Hb conformation is responsible for about half of the Bohr effect in the presence of 100 mm chloride and for almost all of it when chloride is absent (3Kilmartin J.V. Breen J.J. Roberts G.C. Ho C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1973; 70: 1246-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 4Russu I.M. Ho N.T. Ho C.

Biol. 1993; 230: 1291-1296Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Like all vertebrate Hbs, fish Hbs are α2β2 tetramers, generally with ∼40% sequence identity to human Hb but often with single residue insertions in the polypeptide chains. A number of fish Hbs show a very strong Bohr effect so that, at low pH, even exposure to air fails to saturate the protein. This phenomenon is called the Root effect. In attempting to understand this effect, it was natural at first to consider a molecular mechanism similar to the Bohr effect of HbA. Perutz and Brunori (18Perutz M.F. Brunori M. Nature. 1982; 299: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) proposed that a serine residue in fish Hb, which is cysteine in human Hb, serves to strengthen the salt bridge formed by the C-terminal residue of the β chains in the T state. The Asp-94β residue of HbA is also changed to glutamate in Root effect Hbs, which was taken as evidence of a stronger salt bridge with the histidine. This hypothesis was supported by the finding that the pH dependence of carp Hb is significantly weakened by chemical removal of the C-terminal histidine of the β chains (19Parkhurst L.J. Goss D.J. Perutz M.F. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 5401-5409Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A final proof of the involvement of this group of residues, however, must involve transplanting the Root effect into another Hb, and all attempts to do so have so far failed. Moreover, crystal structures of Hb from the Antarctic fish Trematomus bernacchii (formerly Pagothenia bernacchii, also known as “emerald rock cod”) in both the deoxy and carbonmonoxy forms show the C-terminal histidine to be free of contacts with any other residues of the protein (20Ito N. Komiyama N.H. Fermi G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 648-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 21Camardella L. Caruso C. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Rutigliano B. Tamburrini M. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sequence alignments of fish Hbs give no other clue to the location of the groups changing pKa with Hb conformation; histidine residues in particular show no particular pattern indicative of the Root effect. Trout Hb I has almost no heterotropic interactions of any kind and has lost a total of 11 histidines per αβ dimer compared with human HbA, including all of the histidines except the proximal and distal histidines in the β subunits (22Tame J.R.H. Wilson J.C. Weber R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 749-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). An alternative proposal for the basis of the Root effect was made upon examination of the structure of carbonmonoxy Hb from Leiostomus xanthurus (“spot”) (23Mylvaganam S.E. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Getzoff E.D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). It was suggested that the effect arises from the repulsion of positively charged residues destabilizing the R state at low pH. This hypothesis is disproved, however, by the finding that another Hb (from Trematomus newnesi) with almost no pH dependence has the same cluster of residues (24Mazzarella L. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Savino C. Vitagliano L. Moody P.C. Zagari A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 897-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In fact the Hbs from T. newnesi and T. bernacchii differ at only 14 positions, which should make it simple to locate the residues involved by mutagenesis. To date, however, this has not proved possible. 2S. Unzai, unpublished results. 2S. Unzai, unpublished results. Part of the problem in discussing the Root effect is the conceptual framework within which Hb has usually been modeled. From the 1970s, the lowering of Hb oxygen affinity by heterotropic ligands such as chloride ions and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate has generally been explained by a shift in the equilibrium between the R and T forms. Thus, mutants of human Hb such as Hb Kansas (Asn 102β → Thr), in which the R state is destabilized show non-cooperative oxygen binding, and this has been attributed to a failure of the protein to undergo the allosteric transition to the R state (25Fermi G. Perutz M.F. Haemoglobin and Myoglobin. Oxford University Press, Oxford1984Google Scholar). These assumptions have not withstood recent re-examination. Tsuneshige, Yonetani and co-workers have shown by a variety of biophysical techniques that, although allosteric effectors do shift the T-R equilibrium toward T, this effect has been “excessively overestimated” (26Yonetani T. Park S.I. Tsuneshige A. Imai K. Kanaori K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34508-34520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Furthermore, inositol hexaphosphate (IHP) and bezafibrate, both compounds known to lower strongly oxygen affinity, are found to bind to the R state and stabilize the αβ dimeric form of Hb, which is generally considered to show only a high affinity (27Tsuneshige A. Park S. Yonetani T. Biophys. Chem. 2002; 98: 49-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of horse Hb bound to bezafibrate is found to be in the R state (28Shibayama N. Miura S. Tame J.R.H. Yonetani T. Park S.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38791-38796Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In the case of Root effect Hbs, it has been postulated that low pH prevents transition to the R state, causing the low oxygen affinity. Yet, even if every molecule were forced into a fixed affinity T state, the oxygen affinity would not be predicted to drop as low as the observations show; even exposed to air, the protein is significantly unliganded at low pH, forcing experimenters to use the high affinity ligand carbon monoxide to achieve high saturation levels of Root effect Hbs under these conditions (29Brunori M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1966; 114: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that a much greater range of ligand affinity is possible within each allosteric state than has been thought previously. Cooperativity within the T state has been suggested by detailed x-ray crystallographic studies of deoxy human Hb exposed to oxygen (30Paoli M. Liddington R. Tame J. Wilkinson A. Dodson G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 775-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but this proposal has not met universal support (31Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Tsuneshige A. Yonetani T. Eaton W.A. Henry E.R. Proteins. 1996; 25: 425-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, in attempting to understand how the oxygen affinity of Hb may be controlled, it is important to consider both the allosteric equilibrium between the R and T conformations and how the affinity of these conformations themselves may be changed. We have determined the sequences of tuna α and β globins, measured the oxygen equilibrium curve for tuna Hb under various conditions, and determined the crystal structures of the protein in the deoxy form at pH 5 and 7.5 and the carbonmonoxy form at pH 8. Differences between these three models indicate groups of residues that may contribute to changes in oxygen affinity both by stabilizing the T state and by weakening oxygen binding to the T state. Preparation of Tuna Hb—Living tuna were obtained from Kinki University, Wakayama, Japan. Blood was collected from the main vein using a heparinized syringe. The erythrocytes were washed three times in cold saline and lysed with distilled water. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for an hour. The supernatant was applied to Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and then deionized by passage through Amberlite MB-3. The protein was then passed again through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with 5 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5. cDNA Sequence Analysis—cDNA for the α and β globin genes of tuna Hb was prepared by the method of Suzuki and Nishikawa (32Suzuki T. Nishikawa T. J. Protein Chem. 1996; 15: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) and sequenced by standard protocols. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of the α and β chains were determined with an automated protein sequencer (Model 476A, Applied BioSystems). The nucleotide-sequence data reported in this paper will appear in the DDBL/EMBL/GenBank™ nucleotide sequence databases with the accession numbers AB093569 (α chain) and AB093568 (β chain). Oxygen Equilibrium Measurement—Oxygen equilibrium curves were measured using the method of Imai et al. (33Imai K. Morimoto H. Kotani M. Watari H. Hirata W. Kuroda M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 200: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 34Imai K. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 76: 438-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Measurement conditions were 60 μm protein in 50 mm Tris or 50 mm bis-Tris containing 100 mm chloride at 25 °C. The pH value was adjusted with concentrated NaOH. 2 mm IHP or ATP was used as an organic phosphate effector. Deoxygenation curves were used to determine the p50 (partial pressure of oxygen at half-saturation) and Hill coefficient (nmax, the maximum slope of the Hill plot). Crystallization and Data Collection—Both deoxy and CO crystals were grown at 20 °C by batch crystallization under an atmosphere of nitrogen or carbon monoxide, respectively, using screw top vials. Carboxyhemoglobin crystals were obtained with 20% polyethylene glycol 2000, 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8), 5% glycerol, and 2% protein. Data sets were collected from a cryo-cooled (100 K) crystal at RIKEN beamline-2 (BL44B2) of the SPring8 Synchrotron in Harima, Japan, using a MAR CCD detector (12Busch M.R. Ho C.E. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 37: 313-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Deoxy-Hb crystals (pH 7.5) were obtained with 20% polyethylene glycol 2000, 20 mm sodium phosphate, and 2% protein. Data were collected at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. Deoxy-Hb crystals (pH 5) were obtained with polyethylene glycol 2000, 50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 5), 100 mm magnesium chloride, 5% glycerol, and 1.5% protein. Data were collected at the Japan Synchrotron Radiation Research Institute beamline (BL40B2) of SPring8 using an ADSC-Quantum 4R detector. These data sets were processed with DENZO, and scaled with SCALEPACK (35Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). Structure Determination and Refinement—The tuna carboxyhemoglobin structure was solved by molecular replacement using the program MOLREP (36Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1451-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 37Vagin A. Teplyakov A. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 1622-1624Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). The search model used was the Pagothenia bernacchii carboxyhemoglobin structure (21Camardella L. Caruso C. D'Avino R. di Prisco G. Rutigliano B. Tamburrini M. Fermi G. Perutz M.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 449-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The initial solution gave a correlation coefficient of 0.571 and an R-factor of 0.416 for the data between 10–4 Å resolution. The refined CO dimer was used as a search model for the deoxy structure at pH 7.5, and the refined model for this structure was used, in turn, to solve the deoxy structure at pH 5. Initial refinement was carried out using the simulated annealing protocol of X-PLOR 3.851 (38Brunger A.T. X-PLOR: A System for Crystallography and NMR, Version 3.851. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1996Google Scholar). Manual rebuilding was performed with the program TURBO-FRODO (39Roussel A. Cambillau C. Staff Silicon Graphics Silicon Graphics Geometry Partner Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1989: 77-78Google Scholar). Water molecules were included in the model at geometrically appropriate locations where the electron density was >3 σ in Fo - Fc maps and 1.3 σ in 2Fa - Fc maps. These models were further refined with REFMAC (40Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Lebedev A. Wilson K.S. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 247-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. All three models have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with structure codes 1V4X (deoxy pH 5), 1V4W (deoxy pH 7.5), and 1V4U (carbonmonoxy pH 8).Table ICrystallographic data collection and refinement dataDeoxy tuna Hb (pH 7.5)Deoxy tuna Hb (pH 5)CO tuna HbCrystal dataSpace groupP212121P21P212121Unit cell (Å)a57.0656.9859.016b59.4260.54102.541c177.5880.64108.451β95.12Resolution range (Å)15–1.7(1.76–1.70)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)20–1.6(1.66–1.60)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)20–2(2.07–2)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)Observed reflections188,770183,763119,094Independent reflections57,39863,64840,369Completeness (%)80.5 (54.5)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)88.4 (72.7)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)89.1 (64.7)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)Mean 〈I〉/σ 〈I〉11.39.811.4Rmerge (%)bRmerge = Σh|Ii – 〈Ii〉|/Σh|Ii|, where Ii is the intensity of an observation, 〈Irang; is the mean value for that reflection, and the summations are over all reflections5.5(24.1)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)7.3(33.1)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)3.6(14.6)aThe numbers in parentheses refer to the outer shell (deoxy form pH 7.5, 1.76–1.70 Å; deoxy form pH 5.0, 1.66–1.60 Å; CO form 2.07–2.0 Å)Refinement parametersAsymmetric unitTetramerTetramerTetramerResolution (Å)15–1.720–1.620–2Free R-factor (%)cR-factor = Σh‖Fo(h)| – |Fc(h)‖/ΣhFo(h), where Fo and Fc are the observed and calculated structure factor amplitudes, respectively.

Tuna Hb was crystallized in the deoxy form using the batch method, reproducibly giving crystals of high quality at both pH 5 and 7.5. Data collection showed that, under these different conditions, the protein gives crystals in space groups P21 and P212121, respectively. In the presence of CO and buffered at pH 8, crystals grew in space group P212121. In each case, the asymmetric unit contained a complete α2β2 tetramer. Phases could readily be determined by molecular replacement using human Hb as a search model. Refinement of each model proceeded smoothly, yielding clear electron density over the whole protein. Data collection and refinement statistics are shown in Table I. Oxygen equilibrium curves were measured under various conditions and with added IHP or ATP at pH 7.4. The curves without IHP or ATP are shown in Fig. 2. The p50 values (given in Table II) show the profound drop in oxygen affinity as the pH falls from 8.4 to 6.4. Under the most acidic set of conditions used, the cooperativity becomes negative so that the slope of the Hill plot falls below 1. Instead of the nmax value, the n50 value is reported instead. Even at pH 7.4, the cooperativity is rather low compared with that of HbA, which has an nmax close to 3. Cooperativity is marginally increased by the presence of the allosteric effectors IHP and ATP, which have similar abilities to reduce oxygen affinity.Fig. 2A Hill plot of the oxygen equilibrium binding curves of tuna Hb at three different pH values in the absence of ATP or IHP.Y is the degree of saturation with oxygen. Under acid conditions, the protein shows negative cooperativity (the slope of the plot drops below 1), implying that one subunit type has a much lower oxygen affinity than the other. The intercept with the x-axis of the low oxygen partial pressure asymptote gives the value of K1, the dissociation constant of the first ligand molecule. In the case of tuna Hb, K1 does not change greatly between pH 7.4 and 6.4. The drop in overall oxygen affinity is due to the negative cooperativity of the protein. Other Root effect Hbs show different behavior, with K1 falling significantly at low pH but the cooperativity not dropping below 1. The pH sensitivity of the isolated β chains suggests that it is the β subunit whose affinity drops at low pH; the importance of the observed movement of the α subunit distal histidine is, at present, unclear.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table IIOxygen equilibrium characteristics of tuna HbpHp50ap50 is the oxygen partial pressure at half-saturation (mm Hg) (Torr)nmax8.44.452.397.415.91.996.489.80.52bThe slope of the Hill plot at half-saturation (n50)7.4 + IHP19.12.167.4 + ATP21.72.03a p50 is the oxygen partial pressure at half-saturation (mm Hg)b The slope of the Hill plot at half-saturation (n50) Open table in a new tab Overall Structure—Overall the models show strong similarity to human Hb but with a number of key differences. A sequence alignment with human Hb, showing the secondary structure, is shown in Fig. 1. The secondary structure assignment program DSSP gives very similar results for tuna Hb compared with human Hb; in both cases it does not consider the “C helix” to be a true α-helical structure, although this nomenclature has persisted in over 30 years of Hb research. The α chain has an extra acetylated threonine residue at the N terminus and a single residue insertion at proline 48, giving it 143 residues compared with 141 in human α-globin. The latter position, around the CE corner of the α chains, is where the Cα traces of the two proteins most diverge. Most internal amino acid replacements between HbA and tuna Hb are conservative; the pattern of surface charges is rather different, reflecting the probable role of these residues in maintaining protein solubility. The heme pockets of the tuna protein closely resemble those of HbA. The distal valine and histidine residues are preserved, and no mutation close to the hemes has any structurally apparent role in the Root effect (Fig. 3). The largest change near the hemes appears to be Ala-63α in HbA → Met 65α (in tuna Hb). This residue is on the E helix but facing away from the heme; it presses against Trp-15α in the A helix of the same chain but is compensated by two more changes, Tyr 24α → Ile and Thr67α → Ala. Along with the overall tertiary structure, the quaternary structure and allosteric change are well preserved in tuna Hb. Using the program ESCET (41Schneider T.R. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we have determined a set of Cα atoms within the αβ dimer that appears to be relatively invariant upon ligation and seems to provide a better framework for structural analysis than does the widely used “BGH frame” (42Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). In the case of tuna Hb, the residues selected were α 5–10, 13–36, 52–59, and 106–119 and β 110–117 and 122–140. We have found similar results with recent high-resolution structures of human Hb. 3T. Yokoyama, H. Morimoto, S. Unzai, J. R. H. Tame, and S.-Y. Park, manuscript in preparation. Contrary to the case with the BGH frame, therefore, the most rigid atoms are found in different regions of the α and β subunits. Using the 84 Cα atoms for this “tuna ESCET” frame gives a root mean square difference of 0.296 Å between the deoxy pH5 structure and the tuna carboxyhemoglobin structure, less than half the value (0.670 Å) found using the BGH frame, which uses only 78 atoms. Using this frame of reference, the two αβ dimers undergo a rotation of 13.3° relative to each other upon switching from the deoxy to the CO form, almost exactly the same angle found with human Hb. Allosteric Mechanism—The key residues involved in switching from the deoxy structure to the liganded structure, identified in HbA by Perutz (16Perutz M.F. Nature. 1970; 228: 726-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (2188) Google Scholar) and Baldwin and Chothia (42Baldwin J. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 175-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar), are unaltered in tuna Hb (Fig. 4). The changes that occur upon the ligation of deoxy human HbA have been more precisely detailed by Paoli et al. (30Paoli M. Liddington R. Tame J. Wilkinson A. Dodson G. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 256: 775-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 43Paoli M. Dodson G. Liddington R.C. Wilkinson A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Asp-96α is a central residue in the switch region that makes important interactions in both the T and R conformations of the protein. Tuna Hb and HbA show very similar patterns of hydrogen bonding in each state, with Asp-99β1 bonding to Tyr-43α2 and Asn-99α2 in the T state but not the R state. Asn-102β1 also shows R state interactions with Trp-37β1 and Asp-96α2 that are similar to those seen in human HbA; but in the human protein Asn-102β moves markedly away from the other two residues in the T state. This movement is rather smaller in the tuna protein, roughly 1.5 Å less, so that in the T state the Asn remains within hydrogen-bonding distance of the tryptophan and asparagine, although the interactions are clearly weaker than in the R state. At the sliding contact, His-97β moves across the C helix in the same way. The mechanism of heme-heme interaction is also preserved. In the case of the α subunits, Tyr-1"
https://openalex.org/W1992043132,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is a transmembrane protein capable of transducing stimulation by secreted FGFs. In addition, newly synthesized FGFR1 enters the nucleus in response to cellular stimulation and during development. Nuclear FGFR1 can transactivate CRE (cAMP responsive element), activate CRE-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and gene activities causing cellular growth and differentiation. Here, a yeast two-hybrid assay was performed to identify FGFR1-binding proteins and the mechanism of nuclear FGFR1 action. Ten FGFR1-binding proteins were identified. Among the proteins detected with the intracellular FGFR1 domain was a 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK1), a regulator of CREB, CBP, and histone phosphorylation. FGFR1 bound to the N-terminal region of RSK1. The FGFR1-RSK1 interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization in the nucleus and cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Predominantly nuclear FGFR1-RSK1 interaction was observed in the rat brain during neurogenesis and in cAMP-stimulated cultured neural cells. In TE671 cells, transfected FGFR1 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated, almost exclusively, with nuclear RSK1. Nuclear RSK1 kinase activity and RSK1 activation of CREB were enhanced by transfected FGFR1. In contrast, kinase-deleted FGFR1 (TK–), which did not bind to RSK1 failed to stimulate nuclear RSK1 activity or RSK1 activation of CREB. Kinase inactive FGFR1 (K514A) bound effectively to nuclear RSK1, but it failed to stimulate RSK1. Thus, active FGFR1 kinase regulates the functions of nuclear RSK1. The interaction of nuclear FGFR1 with pluripotent RSK1 offers a new mechanism through which FGFR1 may control fundamental cellular processes."

Similar to broad conversion of phytoestrogens (Basu, N. K., Ciotti, M., Hwang, M. S., Kole, L., Mitra, P. S., Cho, J. W., and Owens, I. S. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 1429–1441), UGT1A10 metabolized estrogens and their derivatives, whereas UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A7, and -1A8 differentially exhibited reduced activity toward the same. UGT1A10 compared with UGT1A7, -1A8, and -1A3 generally exhibited high activity toward acidic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and natural benzaldehyde derivatives, while UGT1A3 metabolized most efficiently aromatic transcinnamic acids known to be generated from flavonoid glycosides by microflora in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Finally UGT1A10, -1A7, -1A8, and -1A3 converted plant-based salicylic acids; methylsalicylic acid was transformed at high levels, and acetylsalicylic (aspirin) and salicylic acid were transformed at moderate to low levels. Atypically UGT1A10 transformed estrogens between pH 6 and 8 but acidic structures preferentially at pH 6.4. Furthermore evidence indicates UGT1A10 expressed in COS-1 cells depends upon phosphorylation; UGT1A10 versus its single, double, and triple mutants at three predicted protein kinase C phosphorylation sites incorporated [33P]-orthophosphate and showed a progressive decrease with no detectable label or activity for the triple T73A/T202A/S432G-1A10 mutant. Single and double mutants revealed either null/full activity or null/additive activity, respectively. Additionally UGT1A10-expressing cultures glucuronidated 17β-[14C]estradiol, whereas cultures containing null mutants at protein kinase C sites showed no estrogen conversion. Importantly UGT1A10 in cells supported 10-fold higher glucuronidation of 17β-estradiol than UGT1A1. In summary, our results suggest gastrointestinally distributed UGT1A10 is important for detoxifying estrogens/phytoestrogens and aromatic acids with complementary activity by UGT1A7, -1A8, -1A3, and/or -1A1 evidently dependent upon phosphorylation.

Many aromatic chemicals are taken into the body unwittingly as components of plant-based diets and as therapeutic agents. Although there are several different categories of chemicals in dietary plants, the flavonoids are by far the largest group and include quasiactive phytoestrogens, which often mimic endogenous estrogens due to structural similarities (1Rickard D.J. Monroe D.G. Ruesink T.J. Khosla S. Riggs B.L. Spelsberg T.C. J. Cell. Biochem. 2003; 89: 633-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Additionally there are non-flavonoid-type estrogenic chemicals in plants, e.g. coumestrol and zearalenone, which are reported to have toxic effects in the body (2Seawright A.A. Nat. Toxins. 1995; 3: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). While it is known that phytoestrogens can have beneficial tumor-suppressing activity (3Lamartiniere C.A. Cotroneo M.S. Fritz W.A. Wang J. Mentor-Marcel R. Elgavish A. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 552-558Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and other effects (4Fitzpatrick L.A. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1999; 74: 601-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), it is not generally known that the chemicals can also be destructive to animal reproductive systems as shown by the collapse and emaciation of the reproductive and urinary systems of livestock that grazed on clovers and crops with high phytoestrogen content (2Seawright A.A. Nat. Toxins. 1995; 3: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additionally the phytoestrogens genistein, daidzein, and equol as well as the estrogenic flavonoid precursors (5Frigo D.E. Duong B.N. Melnik L.I. Schief L.S. Collins-Burow B.M. Pace D.K. McLachlan J.A. Burow M.E. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 1848-1853Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) chalcones have been shown to have potent effects on cardiac contractility (6Liew R. Williams J.K. Collins P. MacLeod K.T. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2003; 304: 985-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). While modest accumulations of phytoestrogens may be inconsequential or beneficial, absorption of high levels of phytoestrogens (isoflavones) can lead to adverse and serious disruption of systems and individual enzymes that could possibly initiate disease(s). Many ingested chemicals also have the potential to interact with each other or with conventional therapeutic agents. The plant antistress agent, salicylic acid, is ingested unwittingly (7Adebe W. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 2002; 27: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) and has the potential to interact with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 1The abbreviations used are: NSAID, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug; UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; GI, gastrointestinal; PKC, protein kinase C; 17β-est, 17β-estradiol; 17β-est-gluc, 17β-estradiol glucuronide; ECG, epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate. Because both salicylic acid and NSAIDs depress the proinflammatory cyclooxygenase enzyme, the combination of these two antiplatelet chemicals enhances the risks of bleeding (7Adebe W. J. Clin. Pharm. Ther. 2002; 27: 391-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). To the extent that our plant-based diet is a source of large quantities of these exogenous chemicals with many structural variations, such conditions, no doubt, have forced animal systems to limit absorption or to adapt to both natural and synthetic chemicals. Notably a study detected less than 1% uptake of an ingested flavonoid in the blood compared with 98% metabolism and binding to protein in the body when 40-fold less of the same chemical was administered intravenously (8Gugler R. Leschik M. Dengler H.J. Eur. J. Clin. Pharmacol. 1975; 9: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the chemical was not absorbed when administered via the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or was metabolized and excreted. Also a variety of simple phenols are generated in the GI system from plant constituents (9Kühnau J. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1976; 24: 117-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Brown J.P. Mutat. Res. 1980; 75: 243-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). Flavonoid glycosides reach the lower GI tract where the microflora both hydrolyze the glycosides and further metabolize free flavonoids to form a range of aromatic chemicals (9Kühnau J. World Rev. Nutr. Diet. 1976; 24: 117-191Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The metabolites include various aromatic acids and aldehydes as break-down products. Hence absorption of ingested chemicals and those generated in the GI tract determine chemical exposure. As these lipophiles are both simple and polyaromatic containing hydroxyl and/or carboxyl group(s), they are potential substrates of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) isozymes, which convert chemicals to glucuronides to enhance water solubility and excretion from cells. To that end, the cluster UGT1A1, -1A7, -1A8, -1A9, and -1A10 of the human UGT1-encoded isozymes (11Gong Q.-H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K. Kubota S. Carvalho S. Pennington M.W. Owens I.S. Popescu N. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) has recently been shown to be differentially distributed throughout the GI tract but strategically located in the mucosal layer of tissues (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1429-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The observation that the Gunn rat model (UGT1–/–) is 100-fold more sensitive to acetaminophen than the wild-type Wistar rat (13de Morais S.M. Wells P.G. Hepatology. 1989; 10: 163-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) indicates glucuronidation is protective against chemical toxins. Because UGT1A10, among the isozyme cluster, is effective in metabolizing all categories of phytoestrogens (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1429-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), it suggested that the isozyme would also metabolize structurally similar endogenous estrogens. Furthermore the high abundance of the isozyme in the lower GI tract led to speculation that it may play a role in converting aromatic acids formed in that region by microflora and ingested therapeutic acidic drugs. In this study, we show that UGT1A10 glucuronidated three different categories of chemicals including estrogens, plant-based cinnamic acid and aromatic acid structures, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and salicylic acid derivatives. While UGT1A10 was the primary metabolizer, studies showed differential overlapping activity with UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A7, and -1A8. The isozyme exhibited different pH optima for catalysis, and it showed a dependence on phosphorylation that is linked to protein kinase C (PKC). Additionally UGT1A10-transfected COS-1 cell cultures glucuronidated 17β-[14C]estradiol unlike those transfected with its null mutants at PKC phosphorylation sites. Chemicals—All substrates were obtained from Sigma, Fluka (Milwaukee, WI), Aldrich, or Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Richmond, VA). Preparation of Microsomes—Human tissue adjacent to that used for in situ analysis (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

Similar to reactions for Km determinations, pH profiles reflect product generated in 2 h at 37 °C with 300 μg of protein from pSVL(UGT)-transfected COS-1 cells. Linear glucuronidation reactions for substrate screens were conducted at both pH 6.4 and 7.6 over 4 h and defined as glucuronide accumulated/4 h as described previously (19Ciotti M. Yeatman M.T.

[33P]Orthophosphate Labeling of UGT1A10 in COS-1 Cells—Sixty hours after transfection with a pSVL-based construct containing either UGT1A10, single mutant (T73A-, T202A-, or S432G-1A10), double mutant (T73A/T202A-, T73A/S432G-, or T202A/S432G-1A10), or triple mutant (T73A/T202A/S432G-1A10), labeling of each was compared with UGT1A10 and control cells.

UGT immunocomplexes bound to protein A-Sepharose were washed four times with buffer A for 1 h, washed overnight with buffer A containing 1 m KCl, and finally washed once each with TBS and water. After samples were boiled in SDS sample buffer to detach protein, each sample was centrifuged through a microSpin column (Amersham Biosciences) to remove beads. Duplicate sets of radiolabeled UGT1A10 and mutants were electrophoresed in an SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel; one gel was processed for exposure to x-ray film, and the duplicate gel was analyzed by Western blot as described above. 17β-[14C]Estradiol Glucuronidation by COS-1 Cells Transfected with UGT1A10, Its Mutants at PKC Phosphorylation Sites, or UGT1A1— Forty-eight hours after transfection with pSVL-based UGT1A1, UGT1A10, or T73A-, T202A-, or S432G-1A10 mutants, COS-1 cells were conditioned in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4% charcoal-stripped (22Liew R.

Also a concentration range of 17β-estradiol was studied. After 3 h, 500 μl of medium in triplicates were diluted 1:2 with cold ethanol and centrifuged to remove protein. Recovered supernatant was spun dry and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. One-half of each sample was treated with buffer or 50 units of β-glucuronidase in 50 μm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, for 2 h at 37 °C.

We found that UGT1A10 is primarily distributed in the mucosal layer of the GI tract below the stomach (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

We also used microsomes prepared from tissue adjoining to that used for in situ hybridization in conjunction with the highly specific UGT1A10 substrate epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (ECG) (see Ref. 12Basu N.K.

(Determination of substrate specificity was based on a screen of 40 chemicals using recombinant UGT1A1, -1A7, -1A8, -1A9, and -1A10 (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W.

Under similar conditions and for a given substrate, isozyme specificity was determined as the ratio of an isozyme activity to the sum of all isozyme activities.) In this study with GI microsomes, we compared ECG with two other UGT1A10 substrates, flurbiprofen (pH 6.4) and 17β-estradiol (pH 7.0), which were 83 and 89% specific, respectively. UGT1A10 appeared to be present in duodenum:ileum:colon:stomach:esophagus at relative levels of 9:8:3:2:1 (Fig. 1). While the isozyme was most abundant in small and large intestines, followed by stomach, and it showed greater turnover of 17β-estradiol than ECG and flurbiprofen, it appeared to be detectable in esophageal microsomes by substrate analysis. Although UGT1A8 is detectable only in the stomach by Northern blot analysis (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

Except for stomach, UGT1A8 was concentrated in a highly erratic pattern in limited regions of all GI tissues. UGT1A7, on the other hand, was highest in esophagus and at low to intermediate levels in nearly every tissue with the highest level in thyroid and adrenal glands (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S.

In a recent study with bilirubin as UGT1A1-specific substrate (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S. Cho J.W. Owens I.S. J. Biol.

Western Blot Analysis of UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A7, -1A8, and -1A10 Expressed in COS-1 Cells—To normalize the relative levels of UGT proteins, we carried out Western blot analysis (Fig. 2) with the UGT1A common end antibody (16Ciotti M. Basu N. Brangi M. Owens I.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), and the relative levels of UGT1A1, -1A3, -1A7, -1A8, and -1A10 synthesized in COS-1 cells were determined by scanning blots with a UMAX system and quantifying with Adobe Photoshop software. After normalizing relative protein levels, specific activities were calculated and are shown. pH Optimization and Km Determination for Glucuronidation of 17β-Estradiol and Flurbiprofen by UGT1A10—Since our earlier studies with UGT1A-encoded isozymes demonstrated optimal conditions for glucuronidation depended, to a large extent, upon the acceptor substrate (12Basu N.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1429-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we optimized conditions for the type of chemical. UGT1A10 metabolized 17β-estradiol with a pH optimum between 6 and 8, and it metabolized flurbiprofen with a narrower pH range between 6 and 6.4 (Fig. 3, A and C); typical pH 7.6 assay conditions did not show glucuronidation of the latter aglycone. The pH profile for glucuronidation of ECG (not shown) was essentially the same as for flurbiprofen. Since increasing concentrations of phloretin and eugenol up to 200 μm stimulated UGT1A10 activity and higher levels showed progressive inhibition that culminated at 100% by 800 μm (12Basu N.K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1429-1441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), we examined effects of 17β-estradiol or flurbiprofen concentration on activity. Concentrations of 17β-estradiol and flurbiprofen from 200 to 400 μm stimulated activity, which was sustained up to 800 μm. The Km value for both 17β-estradiol and flurbiprofen was 64 μm (Fig. 3, B and D). Complete inhibition of UGT1A10 by 800 μm phloretin or eugenol (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S. Kole L. Mitra P.S.

Increasing the concentration of 17β-estradiol from 2 to 20 μm caused a 2-fold increase in UGT1A10 activity as seen in Fig. 3B, and further increases in concentrations up to 100 μm (Fig. 4) showed almost a linear increase in activity. To the contrary, 20 μm 17β-estradiol showed no detectable conversion by UGT1A1, but 40 μm elicited a substantial UGT1A1 activity that was barely enhanced further by increases up to 100 μm (Fig. 4). Unlike its limited concentration effects on UGT1A1 conversion, 17β-estradiol supported a high rate of metabolism by UGT1A10 between 2 and 200 μm (Figs. 3B and 4). At 40 μm, UGT1A10 showed >10-fold greater activity than UGT1A1 (Fig. 4). Glucuronidation of Estrogens, Plant-derived Aromatic Acids, and Nonsteroid Anti-inflammatory Drugs by UGT1A10, -1A1, -1A3, -1A7, and -1A8 —In an earlier study (12Basu N.K. Ciotti M. Hwang M.S.

Furthermore we found that UGT1A4, -1A5, -1A6, and -1A9 and UGT2B7 and -2B15 did not show a significant activity toward the primary estrogens (data not shown) (26Ritter J.K. Sheen Y.Y. Owens I.S. J.

Acrylodan fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to its local environment, and when bound to protein, exhibits changes in both intensity and emission wavelength that are reflected in the degree of solvent exclusion and the effective dielectric constant of the environment of the fluorophore.

This approach allows one to analyze the environment around the conjugated fluorophore side chain and the changes induced by bound ligand.

Such residue-selective changes in fluorescence parameters suggest that certain ligands can induce distinct conformational states of the binding protein, and that mutually exclusive binding results from disparate portals of entry to and orientations of the bound α-toxin and smaller acetylcholine congeners at the binding pocket. Labeling at other residue positions around the predicted binding pocket also reveals distinctive spectral changes for α-bungarotoxin, agonists, and alkaloid antagonists.

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) 1The abbreviations used are: nAChR, nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; AChBP, acetylcholine-binding protein; LGIC, ligand-gated ion channel. is the prototypic member of the superfamily of pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (LGIC), that include γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, and serotonin (5-HT3) receptors. These receptors are prevalent mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and targets of drug action. nAChR subtypes mediate fast neurotransmission both centrally as well as in the periphery by linkage to an intrinsic cation channel. Since the late 1960s (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Karlin A. Nat. Rev.

A. 1970; 67: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar), structure and function of nAChRs have been under intense study, although these transmembrane proteins have resisted crystallization, precluding high-resolution structures from x-ray crystallography. However, electron microscopy and image reconstruction have detailed the overall shape of the molecule and uncovered potential changes in conformation associated with ligand binding (4Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 5Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 424: 949-955Crossref Scopus (1088) Google Scholar). In this family of channels, each subunit contains an extracellular domain encompassing the first ∼210 amino acids followed by four transmembrane α-helical segments; ligand binding sites are formed at subunit interfaces on the extracellular side (1Corringer P.J. Le Novere N. Changeux J.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 431-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 2Karlin A. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). nAChRs are members of the Cys-loop family of LGICs, so named because of a conserved disulfide linkage in their amino-terminal, extracellular domains. In 2001, a soluble protein homologous to the extracellular domain of the nAChR, termed the acetylcholine-binding protein (AChBP), was identified, characterized, and its structure determined by x-ray crystallography (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

While sharing modest sequence identity with all members of the Cys-loop family of LGIC, AChBP most closely resembles the homomeric neuronal nicotinic receptor subunits (α7, ∼25% residue identity). In functional terms, AChBP shares virtually all of the ligand binding characteristics with the nicotinic receptor family, and reveals a structure largely consistent with the electron microscopy image, chemical modification, mutagenesis, and spectroscopic data. Based on the position of the associated HEPES buffer molecule (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), the ligand binding site at the subunit interface appeared to be formed from the side chain determinants of binding ascertained previously from mutagenesis and chemical modification (8Taylor P.

As a soluble entity of similar overall structure, AChBP provides new opportunities to investigate the structure and function of LGIC at the molecular level. Furthermore, should it be possible to couple AChBP to the receptor transmembrane-spanning region and achieve ligand gating of channel function, the binding protein would possess the conformational capabilities of the extracellular domain of receptors. Hence, conformational changes induced by ligand binding to AChBP may have global implications for ligand gating mechanisms for ion channels. Another acetylcholine recognition protein with intrasubunit disulfide linkages, acetylcholinesterase (AChE), has multiple high resolution crystal structures of complexes for several ligands bound at its active center and peripheral site (13Silman I. Sussman J.L. Giacobini E. Cholinesterases and Cholinesterase Inhibitors. Martin Dunitz Ltd., London2000: 9-25Google Scholar, 14Sussman J.L. Harel M. Frolow F. Oefner C. Goldman A. Toker L. Silman I.

Although these structures exhibit differences in conformation and side chain orientations, their overlay is likely to reveal only a small fraction of the conformational space of the AChE molecule in solution and the potential structural fluctuations and plasticity of the various ligand complexes (16Bourne Y.

Cysteine substitution mutagenesis is followed by acrylodan conjugation to the single introduced cysteine, which reveals changes in hydrophobicity and solvent exposure at various acrylodan positions on the AChE molecule associated with ligand binding. Conjugates of longer-lived fluorescein and anilinonaphthalene fluorophores with the introduced cysteines reveal distinct differences in segmental motion of certain structural domains of AChE upon ligand association (18Shi J. Tai K. McCammon J.A. Taylor P. Johnson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 30905-30911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The results from these fluorescence-based studies in another system provide evidence for the value of the studies in solution described herein. We undertook cysteine substitution mutagenesis and fluorophore conjugation at selected positions to describe the immediate environment surrounding the fluorophore, and examine regional flexibility of AChBP, as a nAChR surrogate. Ligand binding in the vicinity of the fluorophore may reveal changes in solvent exposure by ligand occlusion or through conformational changes induced by the ligand. Acrylodan fluorescence emission is highly sensitive to its local environment when bound to protein, and exhibits changes in both intensity and emission wavelength that reflect the effective dielectric constant of the environment around the fluorophore. Hence, cysteine mutants were generated based on the AChBP crystal structure and predicted ligand binding sites, and fluorescence parameters were assayed on the acrylodan-conjugated proteins. This approach allows one to analyze the environment around the conjugated fluorophore side chain and the changes induced by bound ligand. Fluorescence emission data from nine acrylodan-labeled residues residing near the predicted binding pocket in AChBP reveal distinctive spectroscopic changes for α-bungarotoxin and the alkaloid agonists and antagonists, allowing us to describe ligand binding orientations with respect to the distinctive C-loop in the protein. Ligands and Labeling Reagents—(+)-Epibatidine, gallamine, α-bungarotoxin, nicotine, and carbamylcholine were purchased from Sigma (Fig. 1). d-Tubocurarine chloride was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Methyllycaconitine citrate was purchased from Tocris (Ellisville, MO). Metocurine iodide was a gift from the Eli Lilly Co. Acrylodan was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). 125I-α-Bungarotoxin (specific activity: 80 Ci/mmol) was a product of PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Inc. All other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available. Expression, Mutagenesis, and Purification of AChBP—Wild-type AChBP from Lymnaea stagnalis was expressed from a cDNA synthesized from oligonucleotides selected for mammalian codon usage, as previously described (19Hansen S.B.

Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Briefly, the AChBP gene was inserted into a p3×FLAG-CMV-9 expression vector (Sigma) containing a preprotrypsin leader peptide followed by a NH2-terminal 3×FLAG epitope. A COOH-terminal His6 tag was attached for radioligand binding assays. Mutant AChBPs were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated standard mutagenesis procedures, and cassettes containing the mutation were subcloned into the wild-type vector and verified by double-stranded sequencing. Wild-type and mutant AChBP-transfected HEK-293 cells were selected with G418 to generate stably expressing cell lines. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MediaTech CellGro) containing 3% fetal bovine serum was collected at 3-day intervals from multitier flasks for up to 4 weeks. Adsorption onto a FLAG antibody column followed by elution with the 3×FLAG peptide yielded purified protein in quantities between 0.5 and 2 mg/liter. Purity and assembly of subunits as a pentamer were assessed by SDS-PAGE and fast protein liquid chromatography. Radioligand Binding Assays—A scintillation proximity assay (SPA, Amersham Biosciences) was adapted for use in a soluble radioligand binding assay. In 200-μl reaction vessels, AChBP (0.5 nm binding sites) was incubated with increasing concentrations of either 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin or (+)-epibatidine in a solution of 0.1 mg/ml anti-His SPA beads. In competition assays, 125I-labeled α-bungarotoxin was held constant at 20 nm and epibatidine was added in variable concentrations. Radioactivity was measured on a Beckman LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter. All radioligand binding data are averages of at least three replicate experiments. Acrylodan Labeling—The labeling reactions contained 20 μm AChBP (monomer concentration), 100 μm acrylodan, in 100 μl of 0.1 m NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.0. Labeling reactions ran for 90 min at room temperature, after which unreacted label was removed by buffer exchange (4 × 2-ml washes) in Centricon YM-30 spin columns (Amicon). The degree of specific labeling was assessed by comparison with labeling of wild-type AChBP where the four cysteines are disulfide linked as cystines, after normalization to protein concentration by the Bradford assay. Specific labeling for each mutant was as follows: W53C, 90%; L112C, 95%; M114C, 91%; K139C, 88%; E157C, 76%; Y164C, 78%; Q178C, 93%; S182C, 79%. Stoichiometry of labeling for each preparation was estimated from a comparison of acrylodan concentration (by absorption at 372 nm, extinction coefficient ∼16,400 m-1 cm-1) and protein concentration (by absorption at 280 nm, extinction coefficient ∼268,000 m-1 cm-1). Stoichiometry of labeling for each mutant was as follows: W53C, 79%; L112C, 59%; M114C, 57%; K139C, 55%; E157C, 55%; Y164C, 48%; Q178C, 88%; S182C, 49%. Spectrofluorometric Assays—Steady-state emission spectra were measured at room temperature using a Jobin Yvon/Spex FluoroMax II spectrofluorometer (Instrument S.A., Inc., Edison, NJ) with the excitation and emission band widths set at 5 nm. The excitation wavelength for acrylodan was set at 359 nm, and emission was monitored between 380 and 600 nm. Saturating ligand concentrations were set at ≥10-fold over the KD for that ligand, or ≥5-fold over the concentration of binding sites, whichever was greater. Final ligand concentrations were 2.5 μm for epibatidine, gallamine, α-bungarotoxin, d-tubocurarine, metocurine, nicotine, and methyllycaconitine, and 25 μm for carbamylcholine. The concentration of binding sites in the spectrofluorometric assays was 0.5 μm. Binding saturation was verified by observation that additional increments in ligand concentration did not result in a further chromic shift or change in quantum yield. For binding site titration experiments, the concentration of binding sites was held constant at 1 μm for epibatidine and α-bungarotoxin titrations, and 3 μm for d-tubocurarine and gallamine. Ligand was added in incremental amounts to produce 0.1 μm (for epibatidine and α-bungarotoxin) or 0.3 μm (for d-tubocurarine and gallamine) increases until saturation was achieved. Titration data are based on duplicate experiments; all other fluorescence emission data are an average of at least three replicate experiments. Relative quantum yields were determined from the areas under the emission spectra curves relative to the acrylodan absorption. Stopped-flow Kinetics—Stopped-flow kinetic experiments were conducted using an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV (Leatherhead, UK) stopped-flow spectrophotometer. Acrylodan-conjugated AChBP mutants were excited at 372 nm, and a cut-off filter at 420 nm was used to collect the fluorescence signal. Rates of binding of α-bungarotoxin were estimated from the slope of plots of the observed rate of fluorescence change versus ligand concentration. Rates of dissociation of α-bungarotoxin were measured by reacting the preformed complex with a large excess of wild-type, unlabeled AChBP to scavenge the dissociated ligand, and observing the time course of the change in fluorescence emission. Characterization of the Expressed Protein—The expressed cysteine-substituted AChBPs were monitored to ascertain assembly as a pentamer of the appropriate molecular weight by elution volume on fast protein liquid size-exclusion chromatography and comparison with corresponding data on wild-type preparations (37Hansen S.B. Talley T.T. Radic Z. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24197-24202Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Mutants analyzed further had >90% of the protein eluting as a pentamer rather than as a higher order oligomer or aggregate or as a monomer. Dissociation constants for each AChBP Cys-substituted mutant (see Table I) were determined for two standard ligands, α-bungarotoxin and (+)-epibatidine, using the scintillation proximity assay (a version of a traditional radioligand binding assay). Dissociation constants (KD) for the snake α-toxin were determined by direct saturation binding with 125I-α-bungarotoxin, whereas KD values for epibatidine were determined by competition with the radiolabeled α-toxin. KD values for all the cysteine substitution mutants were within a factor of ∼5 of wild-type AChBP for α-bungarotoxin and epibatidine. An exception was the 15-fold change for M114C. Irrespective of these differences in KD, the ligands retained high affinity for the mutant proteins, indicating that cysteine substitution at the positions studied does not affect the overall fold of the subunits or their assembly.Table IKD values for each mutant with α-bungarotoxin (direct) and epibatidine (competition) For direct saturation experiments, 125I-α-bungarotoxin was added in increasing concentrations to AChBP at 0.5 nm in binding sites. For epibatidine competition with α-bungarotoxin binding, the concentration of 125I-α-bungarotoxin was held constant at 20 nm, and increasing concentrations of cold epibatidine were added to compete with the radioligand. Measurements were done in triplicate and KD values varied by less than a factor of 2.

Representative examples of the wavelength changes in the experimental titrations are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, which describe both hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts from a single site of modification, Q178C, when titrated with α-bungarotoxin or epibatidine, respectively. In all binding site titration experiments, ligand was found to approach a ratio of ∼1:1 with respect to the number of binding sites based on five sites per pentameric assembly (Table II).Fig. 3Titration of binding sites and kinetics of association for α-bungarotoxin at Q178C-acrylodan. Equilibrium emission spectra are presented in A. The ratio of species in B was determined from the wavelength intensities according to the following equation: [(I463 - I485) - (I463 - I485)∞]/[(I463 - I485)0 - (I463 - I485)∞], where I is intensity at the specified wavelength and the subscripts (0, ∞) denote in the absence of ligand and saturating ligand conditions.

This likely reflects the slightly different affinities of the acrylodan-labeled protein and the fractional labeling achieved for the particular acrylodan conjugate. The abrupt intersection of the extrapolated titration lines in Fig. 3B reflects the high affinity of the α-toxin complex, because virtually all of the added α-bungarotoxin binds until the five sites are fully occupied. In some cases, we have estimated the α-bungarotoxin dissociation constant from its component rate constants, showing that it retains its high affinity for the acrylodan-conjugated AChBPs (Table II). Effect of α-Bungarotoxin Binding on Acrylodan Fluorescence Emission—Although the subunits in AChBP are identical, the subunit interface can best be related to the heteromeric receptor where the C-loop face, which contains the vicinal cysteines at 187 and 188, corresponds to the α1 subunit in muscle and the complementary face corresponds to that of the muscle γ, δ, or ϵ subunit. These subunit positions are shown in gray (α) and orange (γ, δ, or ϵ), respectively, in Fig. 4. Changes in acrylodan fluorescence emission initiated by binding of α-bungarotoxin are listed in Table III. In these fluorescence studies, chromic shifts of 2 nm or more in emission maxima were considered significant. α-Bungarotoxin binding produced a large blue shift (15 nm) in emission from the fluorophore side chain buried internally to loop C, W53C, a region of the putative binding pocket (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology: Neuronal Nicotinic Receptors. 144. Springer-Verlag, New York2000: 79-100Google Scholar). Interestingly, minimal (M114C) or small (L112C) shifts in the opposite direction, indicating greater solvent accessibility, are induced in acrylodan-conjugated residues located apical to the binding pocket at the subunit interface. These residues are found on the subunit face complementary to the C-loop. Data from residues on the membrane side of the pocket (E157C, Y164C, and Q178C) reveal emission shifts consistent with a significant decrease in solvent exposure for a residue located directly internal to the pocket (Y164C), as well as those around the exterior face of the subunits (E157C and Q178C). Little to no change in solvent exposure on the membrane side of the pocket on the C-loop face was observed (K139C; see Fig. 4 for structural orientation). Somewhat surprisingly, the largest chromic shift among the labeled sites for any ligand was a 22-nm blue shift at Q178C, by α-bungarotoxin. This indicates a potentially extensive interaction on the α-toxin with an area on the C-loop side of the interface, but at some distance from the pocket and well removed from the predicted binding site region for small ligands (6Brejc K. van Dijk W.J.

All other ligands assayed induce a chromic shift to longer wavelength at the Q178C site. These data distinguish the binding site or conformation for the α-bungarotoxin-bound complex from the conformations of the smaller agonists and competitive antagonists. A minimal change in solvent exposure around the E157C site of acrylodan conjugation, relative to other ligands, is consistent with the greater solvent occlusion by α-bungarotoxin on the C-loop positioned subunit face than the complementary face.Table IIIFluorescence emission parameters of acrylodan-labeled AChBP mutants in the presence of α-bungarotoxin Data were collected from spectra similar to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for the respective acrylodan-conjugated mutant-binding protein and 2.5 μm α-bungarotoxin.AChBP mutantAcrylodan emission maximaChromic shiftRelative quantum yield(–)-Ligandα-BungarotoxinnmW53C489474–151.46L112C49950341.30M114C48648711.04K139C49149211.13E157C508503–51.36Y164C508503–51.43Q178C485463–221.36S182C48248420.99V183C47647710.98 Open table in a new tab Effect of Agonist Binding on Acrylodan Fluorescence Emission—Epibatidine, nicotine, and carbamylcholine (Table IV) all induced blue shifts in acrylodan emission wavelength at the W53C and Y164C sites. Carbamylcholine, having more torsional flexibility in its bonds and occupying a smaller molar volume than the other two agonists, generally produced smaller shifts in emission wavelength. Epibatidine and nicotine decreased solvent exposure in the apical region of the pocket at the L112C position, whereas carbamylcholine did not influence this region. This class of ligands also exerted marked effects on solvent exposure at two positions of fluorophore conjugation presumed to be outside of the pocket; all three agonists significantly decreased polarity of the acrylodan environment at the E157C position, and increased polarity at the Q178C position. These changes in emission wavelength for residues distant from the pocket were also seen for the antagonists, with the emission shift of α-toxin on the Q178C position being the notable exception. Little change in emission wavelength is evident for acrylodan conjugated at S182C and V183C. These side chains reside in a hydrophobic environment and presumably stay fixed in their locations after ligand binding.Table IVFluorescence emission parameters of acrylodan-labeled AChBP mutants in the presence of agonists Data were collected from spectra similar to those shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for the respective acrylodan-conjugated mutant-binding protein and agonist using 2.5 μm nicotine and epibatidine and 25 μm carbamylcholine.AChBP mutantAcrylodan emission maximaChromic shiftRelative quantum yield(–)-LigandEpibatidinenmW53C489484–51.09L112C499483–161.92M114C48648711.08K139C491489–21.08E157C508498–101.72Y164C508499–91.70Q178C48549380.90S182C48248420.97V183C47647820.95AChBP mutant(–)-LigandNicotineChromic shiftRelative quantum yieldW53C489480–91.02L112C499492–71.25M114C48648600.99K139C49149320.96E157C508503–51.21Y164C508502–61.29Q178C48549270.91S182C48248310.94V183C47647600.95AChBP mutant(–)-LigandCarbamylcholineChromic shiftRelative quantum yieldW53C489485–40.94L112C49949900.95M114C48648600.96K139C49149320.95E157C508502–61.05Y164C508506–21.00Q178C48549160.92S182C482480–20.95V183C47647710.94 Open table in a new tab Effect of Alkaloid Antagonist Binding o"

Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is critical for the survival of several cell types, including neurons. To determine whether additional signaling pathways cooperate with PI3K to promote survival, we examined other pathways known to be activated by NGF. NGF activated protein kinases C (PKCs) in sympathetic neurons, and pharmacologic PKC activation rescued neurons from apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of NGF. Inhibition of PKCs did not inhibit the survival of NGF-maintained neurons. Similarly, inhibition of PI3K caused only a modest attrition of neurons in the presence of NGF. In contrast, the simultaneous inhibition of both PKCs and PI3K induced the apoptotic death of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons. Inhibition of both PI3K and PKCs promoted the expression and phosphorylation of the proapoptotic transcription factor c-Jun, indicating that these pathways inhibit programmed cell death at the stage of proapoptotic gene expression. In culture conditions under which PI3K inhibition alone kills NGF-maintained neurons, PKC inhibition also led to a significant loss of viability, indicating that both pathways are required.

NGF promotes survival via activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase, TrkA (3Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 4Bothwell M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1995; 18: 223-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). However, the signaling pathways that account for the survival promoting activities of NGF are not completely understood. Although phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is important for the NGF-dependent survival of sympathetic neurons (5Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2000; 10: 381-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1670) Google Scholar), whether PI3K is the only required signaling pathway is unresolved. Under certain culture conditions, PI3K appears to be necessary and sufficient for NGF-dependent survival (6Crowder R.J. Freeman R.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Mazzoni I.E. Said F.A. Aloyz R. Miller F.D. Kaplan D. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 9716-9727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Vaillant A.R.

Tolkovsky A.M. Brain Res. 1999; PubMed Google Scholar, 10Philpott K.L. McCarthy M.J. Klippel A. Rubin L.L. J.

Therefore, additional signaling pathways probably function in the NGF-dependent survival of sympathetic neurons. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of serine/threonine kinases encompasses at least 12 members that participate in cellular functions ranging from proliferation to apoptosis (12Dempsey E.C. Newton A.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Fields A.P. Reyland M.E. Insel P.A. Messing R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: L429-L438Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Battaini F. Pharm. Res. (N. Y.). 2001; 44: 353-361Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The PKC family can be separated into three groups based on their regulation. The conventional PKCs (α, βI, βII, and γ) are activated by DAG and phorbol esters and also require calcium, whereas the novel PKCs (δ, ϵ, θ, η, μ, and ν) require DAG or phorbol esters for activation but are insensitive to calcium. The atypical PKCs (ξ and ι/λ) are not sensitive to DAG, phorbol esters, or calcium. PKCμ and PKCν, although they are activated by DAG and phorbol esters, lack the autoinhibitory pseudosubstrate domain and are therefore probably regulated quite differently than other novel PKCs and are frequently termed PKDs to distinguish them. Growth factor receptors regulate PKCs via the activation of phospholipase C-γ. Phospholipase C-γ, upon binding to phosphorylated Tyr785 in TrkA, is itself phosphorylated and activated (14Loeb D.M. Stephens R.M. Copeland T. Kaplan D.R. Greene L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8901-8910Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), hydrolyzing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to produce DAG and inositol trisphosphate and thus activating PKCs. Growth factor receptors also influence PKC activity through the phosphorylation of the activation loop of PKC by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (15Toker A. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 652-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 16Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; : 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Although PKCs have been implicated in the regulation of survival, their function varies depending upon the cell type and apoptotic signal (17Cross T.G. Scheel-Toellner D. Henriquez N.V. Deacon E. Salmon M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 34-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (620) Google Scholar, 18Musashi M. Ota S. Shiroshita N. Int. J. Hematol. 1999; 72: 12-19Google Scholar). PKC-α, -β, -ϵ, and -ξ can function as suppressors of apoptosis, whereas PKC-δ and -θ appear to be proapoptotic in function. PKC-δ appears to be involved in apoptosis induced by several stimuli and is cleaved by caspase-3 to generate a catalytically active fragment (19Emoto Y. Manome Y. Meinhardt G. Kisaki H. Kharbanda S. Robertson M. Ghayur T. Wong W.W. Kamen R. Weichselbaum R. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6148-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). Whether PKCs function in the trophic factor-dependent survival of neurons is unclear. Tyr785 of TrkA, and thus phospholipase C-γ, is required for neurite outgrowth stimulated by NGF in the sympathetic neuron-like cell line PC12 but is not required for survival (20Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 21Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). Atypical PKCs, however, may function in the survival of PC12 cells via activation of NF-κB (22Wooten M.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 607-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We examined to what extent PKC signaling is involved in the survival of sympathetic neurons and here provide evidence that PKCs have a cooperative function in NGF-dependent survival along with PI3K. Materials—LY294002 and GF109203X were obtained from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); Bryostatin 1 and PMA were from Calbiochem; and boc-aspartyl fluoromethyl ketone (BAF) was obtained from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA). These compounds were dissolved in Me2SO and used at the concentrations described under “Results.” Anti-phospho-MAPK, anti-phospho-AKT (Ser472), anti-phospho-c-Jun (Ser(P)63), anti-phospho-PKC substrate, anti-phospho-pan-PKC, anti-phospho-PKCα/βII (Thr638/641), and anti-PKC-α were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Anti-BIM was purchased from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA); anti-actin and anti-Trk (C14) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10) was from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Waltham, MA). All antibodies were used for immunoblotting at a 1:1000 dilution. Reagents were purchased from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Sympathetic Neuronal Cultures and Treatments—The superior cervical ganglia from postnatal day 1 Sprague-Dawley rats were dissected, dissociated and seeded onto rat tail collagen-coated 35-mm culture dishes or 2-well glass chamber slides (Nunc, Naperville, IL) as previously described (23Martin D.P. Schmidt R.E. DiStefano P.S. Lowry O.H. Carter J.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 829-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Cultures were maintained for 5 days in vitro in medium (90% minimum essential medium, 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 20 μm uridine, 20 μm fluorodeoxyuridine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) containing NGF (50 ng/ml). Cultures were then treated as described under “Results.” For the NGF deprivations in the survival and rescue experiments, the neurons were washed twice with medium not containing NGF (AM0), and AM0 containing anti-NGF (goat polyclonal, 1:10,000 dilution) was then added for the amount of time indicated. In all experiments, control cultures were subjected to the same number of washes as the other conditions, and the original type of medium containing the vehicle alone (Me2SO) was added back. For immunoblotting experiments involving the NGF stimulation of neurons to observe PKC activation, sympathetic neurons were washed twice with AM0 and maintained in AM0 for 24 h; no anti-NGF was used in these experiments. For stimulation, one-fourth of the medium from each dish was removed, NGF was added to it, and this medium was added back. The final concentration of NGF in these stimulations was 50 ng/ml. For experiments involving serum-free conditions, the neurons were plated and maintained in the serum-containing medium described above for 4 days in vitro. The neurons were then switched to serum-free medium containing N2 supplement (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 30 nm selenium, 20 nm progesterone, 100 μm putrescine, 5 ng/ml insulin, 12 μg/ml transferrin, and 1 mg/ml BSA) and NGF (50 ng/ml), and the experiments were initiated 1 day later in the continued presence of N2 medium. For the NGF rescue experiments, the neurons were deprived of NGF for 20 or 26 h. The sympathetic neurons were washed twice with AM0 and then treated with medium containing either anti-NGF, TPA (100 ng/ml), or NGF (200 ng/ml) for 5 h. The neurons were then washed again with AM0 and returned to medium containing NGF (200 ng/ml). The next day, the medium was then replaced with medium containing 50 ng/ml NGF and maintained for 5 additional days. Survival Assays—Toluidine blue staining was performed as described previously (11Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Putcha G.V. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7228-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, after the indicated treatments, cultures were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 2 days with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cultures were then stained for 45–60 s in toluidine blue-O (1 g/liter), and the excess stain was removed by washing the slides for an additional 60 s in deionized water. The cells were dehydrated by using successive washes that contained increasing concentrations of ethanol to reach 100% followed by three toluene washes; coverslips were then mounted with Permount (Sigma). Neurons displaying smooth cell bodies that were stained for Nissl substance were considered alive and were counted. All survival counts were obtained in a blinded manner. All experiments were performed on duplicate wells on three or four independent cultures. The data are displayed as the mean ± S.E., and asterisks denote significant differences between two groups according to Student's t test with a p value of <0.05. Immunoblotting—After the described treatments, sympathetic neurons maintained in 35-mm culture dishes were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then detergent-extracted with heated 2× sample buffer (125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.016% bromphenol blue). The extracts were then scraped off of the dish with a cell scraper, transferred to an Eppendorf tube, and boiled for 10 min. The extracts were cooled and diluted to 1×, and SDS-PAGE was performed on these denatured extracts by using 4–12% gradient gels (Novex, San Diego, CA). Resolved proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST). Immunoblots were incubated with a blocking solution consisting of TBST containing 2% BSA for 45 min at room temperature and further incubated for 2 h in TBST containing the primary antibody and 2% BSA. Immunoblots were then washed three times with TBST containing 0.5% BSA, incubated with the secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution) in blocking solution for 45 min, washed twice with TBST containing 0.5% BSA, and finally washed once with TBST alone. Proteins were visualized by using the supersignal chemiluminescent detection system (Pierce). For immunoblotting with anti-phospho c-Jun and anti-Bim, 5% nonfat milk was used as a blocking agent instead of 2% BSA. Immunoblots were reprobed by using the Western analysis protocol described above after stripping residual antibodies from the blots by incubation in 100 mm glycine (pH 2.7) twice for 20 min at room temperature followed by three washes with generous amounts of TBST. Immunoprecipitations—TrkA immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously (24Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Milbrandt J. Johnson Jr., E.M. Neuron. 2002; 33: 261-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the described treatments, the neurons were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min in lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The lysates were then clarified by centrifugation, and Trk antibodies were added (2 μg/immunoprecipitation) to the clarified lysates along with protein A (50 μl of a 50% slurry), and the tubes were rotated for 2–3 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then washed three times with lysis buffer and denatured by the addition of 40 μl of 2× sample buffer followed by heating in a boiling water bath. NGF Promotes PKC Signaling in Sympathetic Neurons—To determine whether NGF treatment induced PKC activity in sympathetic neurons, 6-day in vitro neurons that had been deprived of NGF were stimulated with NGF for various times. The neurons were then detergent-extracted to harvest total cellular proteins, and the extracts were subjected to phospho-PKC (P-PKC) substrate immunoblotting with an antibody that specifically recognizes proteins phosphorylated on PKC consensus sites (Fig. 1A). NGF treatment induced the rapid phosphorylation of a number of proteins on PKC consensus sites, and their phosphorylation was sustained for hours (Fig. 1A). These same proteins were robustly phosphorylated after sympathetic neurons were treated with PMA, a phorbol ester that potently activates conventional and novel PKCs (Fig. 1A), indicating that the P-PKC-substrate antibody detected bona fide PKC substrates rather than substrates of unrelated kinases. To determine the extent to which activators of PKCs can promote the phosphorylation of these proteins, sympathetic neurons that were briefly deprived of NGF were treated with either PMA or bryostatin 1, another potent PKC activator, for various times. The phosphorylation of PKC substrates was monitored by P-PKC substrate immunoblotting of whole cell extracts produced from these neurons. Both PMA and bryostatin 1 promoted robust, but transient, PKC activity in sympathetic neurons (Fig. 1B). In fact, sustained PMA and bryostatin 1 treatment resulted in the down-regulation of the phosphorylation of PKC substrates over time (Fig. 1B). These results further confirm that the proteins that are phosphorylated by NGF treatment (Fig. 1A) are, indeed, downstream substrates of phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs. PKCs are phosphorylated on several residues that regulate their catalytic activity (16Parekh D.B. Ziegler W. Parker P.J. EMBO J. 2000; : 496-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Because PKC substrates are phosphorylated after NGF stimulation, we investigated whether NGF promoted the phosphorylation of PKCs by using antibodies that specifically detect conventional PKCs when phosphorylated on Thr638/641, an autophosphorylation site (P-auto-PKC) that stabilizes the kinase core of the enzyme, or when phosphorylated on the hydrophobic Ser660 phosphorylation site (P-hydro-PKC). The hydrophobic Ser660 site is also autophosphorylated and appears to stabilize the enzyme (25Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 370: 361-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of both Thr638/641 and Ser660 was enhanced by NGF treatment in sympathetic neurons (Fig. 1A), although the increased phosphorylation of Ser660 was delayed compared with Thr638/641. However, in the absence of NGF treatment, a significant amount of PKC was still phosphorylated at these residues (Fig. 1A), suggesting that other factors besides NGF account for much of the PKC phosphorylation observed in sympathetic neurons. Similar to the effect of phorbol ester treatment on PKC substrate phosphorylation, PKC phosphorylation on Thr638/641 and Ser660 was down-regulated in the prolonged presence of PMA and bryostatin 1 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, the level of conventional PKCs themselves were down-regulated with PMA and bryostatin 1 treatment (Fig. 1B), similar to a previous report (26Isakov N. McMahon P. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2091-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This down-regulation of PKCs is because of the degradation of PKCs after their activation, and sustained phorbol ester treatment is sometimes used as a means of inhibiting PKC activity in cells. In addition to phorbol esters, some PKC isozymes are regulated by PI3K via phosphorylation of Thr500 in the PKC activation loop by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (27Chou M.M. Hou W. Johnson J. Graham L.K. Lee M.H. Chen C.S. Newton A.C. Schaffhausen B.S. Toker A. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1069-1077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Le Good J.A. Ziegler W.H. Parekh D.B. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Parker P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 2042-2045Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). To determine whether PI3K regulated NGF-dependent PKC activity in sympathetic neurons, neurons were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002, and PKC activity was monitored by P-PKC substrate immunoblotting of whole cell extracts produced from these neurons. PI3K inhibition blocked the phosphorylation of one PKC substrate that was ∼32 kDa, whereas the other PKC substrates were unaffected (Fig. 2A). In contrast, treatment of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons with GF109203X, a PKC inhibitor that is somewhat selective for conventional PKCs, blocked the phosphorylation of the majority of PKC substrates in sympathetic neurons, although some proteins were minimally altered (Fig. 2A). Similar to previous experiments, PMA promoted a greater initial phosphorylation of PKC substrates than NGF did. NGF deprivation for 2 h led to the dephosphorylation of only the 32-kDa protein, and other PKC substrates were unaffected at this early time point (Fig. 2A). To determine whether PKC inhibition led to the inhibition of the PI3K or MAPK pathways, the phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases was examined by immunoblotting these extracts with antibodies specific to the active, phosphorylated forms of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases. As expected, LY294002 inhibited Akt phosphorylation but did not inhibit extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of PKCs with GF109203X did not alter Akt phosphorylation and changed extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation only modestly (Fig. 2A). Taken together, these experiments indicate that PI3K regulated only a small portion of PKC activity in neurons (clearly discernible only in the 32-kDa substrate) and that the PKC inhibitor GF109203X blocked most PKC phosphorylation events in sympathetic neurons. Furthermore, PKC inhibition in sympathetic neurons did not significantly impair either the MAPK or PI3K pathways. Because PKCs are reported to regulate the activity of RTKs such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (29Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Parker P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14538-14546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Decker S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1984; 4: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we determined whether the inhibition of PKCs in sympathetic neurons altered TrkA autophosphorylation. NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons were treated with either GF109203X or vehicle alone and were then lysed, and TrkA phosphorylation was assessed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting TrkA immunoprecipitates from these lysates. GF109203X treatment did not alter TrkA autophosphorylation or the level of TrkA protein, even after as long as 2 days of PKC inhibition (Fig. 2B). Therefore, conventional PKCs did not regulate the autophosphorylation or stability of TrkA in sympathetic neurons. PKC Activity Protects Sympathetic Neurons from Apoptosis Induced by NGF Deprivation—Because NGF induced PKC activity in sympathetic neurons, we examined whether PKCs could promote their survival. Dissociated sympathetic neurons were deprived of NGF for 24 h or deprived of NGF in the presence of the PKC activator PMA or bryostatin 1. The numbers of surviving neurons were then counted and compared. NGF deprivation led to the apoptosis of ∼70% of neurons within 24 h, and both PMA and bryostatin 1 inhibited significantly the death of these neurons (Fig. 3A). The survival effects of PMA and bryostatin 1 were, however, modest and transient. After an additional 24 h of NGF deprivation, neither PMA nor bryostatin 1 caused any enhancement of survival (data not shown), similar to a previous report (31Tanaka S. Koike T. Neurosci. Lett. 2001; 313: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This temporary effect of PKC activation on survival is probably caused by the transient nature of the effect of these two compounds on PKC activity (Fig. 1B). To compare more directly the survival-promoting ability of PKC activation with NGF, rescue experiments were performed. Rescue experiments allowed us to compare the effectiveness of PMA and NGF at preventing apoptosis of trophic factor-deprived neurons with short rescue periods, thus avoiding the transient effects of PMA on PKC activation. Sympathetic neurons were deprived of NGF for 20 or 26 h and then switched to medium containing NGF, PMA, or vehicle alone for 5 h to rescue those neurons that would have committed to die in that period. After this 5-h rescue period, all neurons were then treated with NGF for the next 6 days, and the number of surviving neurons was counted and compared with neurons that were not deprived of NGF (Fig. 3B). This short, 5-h rescue period avoided the inhibitory effects of prolonged treatments of cells with PMA, thus allowing an accurate assessment of the survival-promoting abilities of phorbol ester-activated PKCs. After 20 h of NGF deprivation, PMA prevented the death of the 20% of neurons from the original population that would have committed to die in this 5-h rescue period, and PMA was equally as effective as NGF was in preventing the cell death of these neurons (Fig. 3C). Similarly, even after 26 h of NGF deprivation, PMA was as effective as NGF at rescuing the roughly 8% of neurons that would have committed to die during this additional 5-h period (i.e. between 26 and 31 h of NGF deprivation) (Fig. 3C), suggesting that PKCs acted late in the cell death pathway to prevent sympathetic neurons from undergoing apoptosis. Therefore, activation of phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs prevented the death of sympathetic neurons that had initiated the cell death program after NGF withdrawal. PKCs Cooperate with PI3K to Promote Neuronal Survival— Given that activation of PKCs prevented the death of NGF-deprived neurons (Fig. 3), we tested whether PKCs were required for the NGF-dependent survival of sympathetic neurons. When sympathetic neurons were deprived of NGF, 80% of neurons died within 48 h (Fig. 4A). In contrast to the dramatic effects of NGF withdrawal on neuronal survival, inhibition of conventional PKCs with GF109203X in the presence of NGF had no effect on their survival (Fig. 4A). This suggests that conventional PKCs were not solely required for the survival of sympathetic neurons. PI3K inhibition of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons has varied effects on their survival. We have reported previously that PI3K inhibition of sympathetic neurons causes a modest and delayed apoptotic death, killing 30–40% of neurons after 4 days of treatment with LY294002 at a concentration that completely blocks activation of Akt (11Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Putcha G.V. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7228-7237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We again observed these same kinetics of death when NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons were treated with LY294002 (Fig. 4A). Therefore, under our culture conditions, PI3K was not solely required for the survival-promoting effects of NGF. To determine whether PKCs and PI3K cooperate to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons, NGF-maintained neurons were treated with both LY294002 and GF109203X, and the number of surviving neurons was determined. The combined inhibition of both PKCs and PI3K caused the death of sympathetic neurons to a similar extent and with similar kinetics as does the withdrawal of NGF (Fig. 4A). As with NGF deprivation (32Deshmukh M. Vasilakos J. Deckwerth T.L. Lampe P.A. Shivers B.D. Johnson Jr., E.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1341-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the cell death caused by PKC and PI3K inhibition was completely prevented with the broad spectrum caspase inhibitor BAF (Fig. 4A), indicating that the combinatorial inhibition of these signaling pathways induced a caspase-dependent, apoptotic death similar to that caused by NGF deprivation. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PKCs and PI3K cooperated to promote the NGF-mediated survival of dissociated sympathetic neurons. To determine whether other means of inhibiting PKC activity also induced programmed cell death in combination with PI3K inhibition, prolonged PMA treatment of neurons was tested. Similar to GF109203X, the sustained treatment of NGF-maintained sympathetic neurons with PMA alone had no effect on their survival (Fig. 4B). In contrast, during treatment with both PMA and LY294002, considerably more neurons underwent cell death as compared with either inhibitor alone (Fig. 4B). PMA and LY204002 induced apoptosis with somewhat delayed kinetics as compared with NGF withdrawal (Fig. 4B), which was observed to a lesser extent when apoptosis was induced with LY294002 and GF109203X (Fig. 4A). The delayed kinetics of apoptosis induced by PMA and LY294002 may be explained by the observation that PMA is a less effective PKC inhibitor than is GF109203X (Figs. 1B and 2A) and that PMA does not down-regulate all phorbol ester-sensitive PKCs (26Isakov N. McMahon P. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2091-2097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Puceat M. Hilal-Dandan R. Strulovici B. Brunton L.L. Brown J.H. J. Biol.

In conclusion, the PI3K and PKC pathways function in a cooperative manner to promote the survival of sympathetic neurons maintained in NGF. PKC and PI3K Are Both Required for NGF-dependent Survival of Sympathetic Neurons Maintained under Serum-free Conditions—Although our previous results indicate that PI3K is not solely required for the survival of sympathetic neurons (11Tsui-Pierchala B.A. Putcha G.V.

https://openalex.org/W2156390455,"Lymphoid malignancies can escape from DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs and γ-radiation by blocking apoptosis-signaling pathways. How these regimens induce apoptosis is incompletely defined, especially in cells with nonfunctional p53. We report here that the BH3-only Bcl-2 family member Bid is required for mitochondrial permeabilization and apoptosis induction by etoposide and γ-radiation in p53 mutant T leukemic cells. Bid is not transcriptionally up-regulated in response to these stimuli but is activated by cleavage on aspartate residues 60 and/or 75, which are the targets of caspase-8 and granzyme B. Bid activity is not inhibitable by c-FlipL, CrmA, or dominant negative caspase-9 and therefore is independent of inducer caspase activation by death receptors or the mitochondria. Caspase-2, which has been implicated as inducer caspase in DNA damage pathways, appeared to be processed in response to etoposide and γ-radiation but downstream of caspase-9. Knock down of caspase-2 by short interfering RNA further excluded its role in Bid activation by DNA damage. Caspase-2 was implicated in the death receptor pathway however, where it contributed to effector caspase processing downstream of inducer caspases. Granzyme B-specific serpins could not block DNA damage-induced apoptosis, excluding a role for granzyme B in the generation of active Bid. We conclude that Bid, cleaved by an undefined aspartate-specific protease, can be a key mediator of the apoptotic response to DNA-damaging anticancer regimens.

Execution of apoptosis requires the activation of effector caspases, which can be accomplished via the death receptor or the mitochondrial pathway (1Adams J. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2481-2495Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Death receptor-induced apoptosis does not require de novo protein synthesis but the mere recruitment of preformed molecules to the receptor, including the inducer caspases-8 and/or -10. Most cellular stresses, however, rely on the primordial mitochondrial pathway, which requires more elaborate intracellular events to become activated. Depending on the stimulus, its activation may involve new synthesis of apoptosis signaling molecules and/or their post-translational modification. The ultimate induction of mitochondrial permeability in this pathway allows the release of cytochrome c (Cyt c), 1The abbreviations used are: Cyt c, cytochrome c; GFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; MIB, mitochondrion incubation buffer; MLPA, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PI, propidium iodide; si, short interfering; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; dn, dominant negative; BSA, bovine serum albumin; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; HA, hemagglutinin; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; ECL, enhanced chemiluminescence; tBid, truncated Bid.

The response of the mitochondrion to upstream stimuli is a critical control point in apoptosis signaling. It is crucial, therefore, to understand how death signals are transmitted to this organelle. In mammals, multiple pro-apoptotic BH3-only members of the Bcl-2 family are specialized in sensing partially distinct stimuli. They integrate apoptotic stimuli into one single pathway by triggering mitochondrial permeabilization by the Bcl-2 family members Bax and/or Bak (2Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T.

There are two prominent models for mode of the action of BH3-only proteins. In one, they transiently interact with Bax and/or Bak, inducing them to form pores in the mitochondrial membrane. In this scenario, inhibitory Bcl-2 family members sequester BH3-only proteins to prevent their pro-apoptotic action (2Letai A. Bassik M.C. Walensky L.D. Sorcinelli M.D. Weiler S. Korsmeyer S.J. Cancer Cells. 2002; 2: 183-192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar, 3Wei M.C. Zong W.X. Cheng E.H. Lindsten T. Panoutsakopoulou V. Ross A.J. Roth K.A. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Science. 2001; 292: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (3373) Google Scholar). In the other model, BH3-only proteins interact with inhibitory Bcl-2 family members and thereby neutralize their function, which results in Bax/Bak activation (4Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). To prevent inappropriate cell death, BH3-only family members are kept in check by mechanisms, which are tailored to each individual member (4Puthalakath H. Strasser A. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). For example, Noxa and Puma are under transcriptional control, in particular by p53 in the DNA damage response (5Han J. Flemington C. Houghton A.B. Gu Z. Zambetti G.P. Lutz R.J. Zhu L. Chittenden T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11318-11323Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 6Nakano K.

Tanaka N. Science. 2000; 288: 1053-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (1713) Google Scholar). Other BH3-only proteins are regulated by various modes of post-translational modification. Bim and Bmf are sequestered to the cytoskeleton and released upon phosphorylation (8Lei K. Davis R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2432-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Bad is sequestered in the cytosol and released upon dephosphorylation (9Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). Bid requires proteolytic cleavage to produce an active carboxyl-terminal fragment, which is achieved by caspase-8 in the death receptor pathway (10Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar) and by granzyme B in apoptosis triggered by cytolytic T cells (11Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). It is important to elucidate the molecular events involved in apoptosis signaling by anti-cancer therapies. The required active participation of cancer cells in bringing about their own demise implies that they can also put up resistance. Whether resistance to apoptosis generally confers therapy resistance is debated, because cells may well die a nonapoptotic death or be irreversibly arrested in the cell cycle in response to anti-cancer regimens (12Brown J.M. Wouters B.G. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 1391-1399PubMed Google Scholar). However, for lymphoid malignancies, convincing evidence has been provided that loss of p53 or Bcl-2 overexpression and resulting apoptosis resistance promotes therapy resistance in vivo (13Schmitt C.A. Wallace-Brodeur R.R. Rosenthal C.T. McCurrach M.E. Lowe S.W. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 499-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14Schmitt C.A. Rosenthal C.T. Lowe S.W. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1029-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Although γ-radiation and DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs are complex inputs, there is a great deal of molecular evidence that the apoptosis signaling pathways initiated by these stimuli emerge from the DNA damage response. DNA damage is sensed by ATM and Chk2 kinases, which phosphorylate and stabilize p53, allowing it to function as a transcription factor (15Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K.

In this way and possibly also via transcription-independent mechanisms, p53 can bring about a cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (17Fridman J.S. Lowe S.W. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 9030-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest usually precedes apoptosis, to allow for repair of DNA damage. Whether apoptosis ensues is negotiated between the DNA repair machinery and the apoptotic machinery (18Sawada M. Sun W. Hayes P. Leskov K. Boothman D.A. Matsuyama S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 320-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). p53 mediates transcription of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members (such as Bax (19Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M.

Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 359-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In this scenario, one can envision that cells are sensitized for apoptosis induction via the mitochondrial pathway as well as the death receptor pathway. Whether they undergo apoptosis may depend on expression levels of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members and/or availability of the death receptor ligand. Wild-type p53 is not absolutely required for apoptosis induction by DNA-damaging regimens, as shown in cycling peripheral T lymphocytes and lymphoma cells of p53-/- mice (25Strasser A. Harris A.W. Jacks T. Cory S. Cell. 1994; 79: 329-339Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar) and in various p53 mutant cancer cell lines. For instance, the Jurkat T leukemic cells used in this study are highly sensitive to DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs, such as the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide, as well as to γ-radiation (26Boesen-de Cock J.G.

However, which signaling molecules activate the mitochondria in this pathway is unclear. In the work reported here, we have addressed this question and found that Bid is the key mediator of mitochondrial activation in the p53-independent DNA damage response in Jurkat T cells. We provide evidence that Bid needs to be proteolytically activated by an aspartate-specific protease to perform its function in this pathway. However, we have excluded granzyme B and all known inducer caspases from playing a role in Bid processing. This includes caspase-2, which has been featured recently as an activator of the mitochondrial pathway in response to DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs (30Lassus P. Opitz-Araya X. Lazebnik Y.

Reagents—Mouse anti-human CD95 monoclonal antibody (mAb) 7C11 was obtained from Immunotech (Marseille, France), soluble human recombinant TRAIL and enhancer from Alexis (Laufelfingen, Switzerland), and etoposide from Sigma. Polyclonal rabbit anti-Bid antibody was raised in our laboratory against a fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase and full-length Bid. It detects full-length and truncated (t)Bid (32Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol.

Anti-actin mAb C4 was obtained from Roche Applied Science; anti-Cyt c mAbs 7H8.2C12 and 6H2.B4, anti-caspase-2/ICH-1L mAb (clone 35), and anti-active caspase-3 mAb were from BD Biosciences. Anti-HA mAb 12CA5 and anti-VSV mAb P5D4 were used as purified Ig prepared from available hybridomas. Rabbit anti-caspase-9 polyclonal antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig and swine anti-rabbit Ig were obtained from Dako A/S (Glostrup, Denmark). Protein A-Sepharose beads and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Cells and Stimulation—The J16 clone was derived from the human T acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line Jurkat by limiting dilution and was selected for CD95 sensitivity (26Boesen-de Cock J.G.

CD95-resistant JA variant clones were derived by limiting dilution from the parental Jurkat line after 5 weeks of selection for cells resistant to anti-CD95 mAb (26Boesen-de Cock J.G.

The functional status of p53 was analyzed in J16 and JA clones by monitoring the transactivation activity of separated alleles in yeast according to Ishioka et al. (33Ishioka C. Frebourg T. Yan Y.X. Vidal M. Friend S.H. Schmidt S. Iggo R. Nat. Genet. 1993; 5: 124-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). All cells expressed one functional and one nonfunctional allele. The JS/J mixed lymphocyte culture was generated by co-culturing peripheral blood mononuclear cells of donor JS with irradiated Jurkat cells. Allogeneic responder T cells were propagated by weekly stimulation with feeder cell mixture and cloned by limiting dilution at 1 cell/well in the same feeder mixture (34Borst J. de Vries E. Spits H. de Vries J.E. Boylston A.W. Matthews E.A. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 1952-1959PubMed Google Scholar). T cell clones JS/J7 and JS/J29 were selected for cytotoxicity toward J16 cells as displayed in a conventional 51Cr release assay. Jurkat cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium and Phoenix-Ampho cells in Dulbecco's modified medium, both supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and antibiotics. Prior to stimulation, Jurkat clones were suspended in serum-free Yssel's medium (26Boesen-de Cock J.G. Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14255-14261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) and seeded at 1 × 106 per ml, 200 μl per well in round-bottom 96-well plates for apoptosis assays and at 5–10 × 106 per ml in 24-well culture plates for Cyt c release assays. Prior to irradiation or treatment with etoposide, cells were cultured overnight in Yssel's medium. After addition of stimulus, cells were incubated for the indicated times at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Routinely, cells were stimulated by incubation with 50 ng/ml anti-CD95 mAb for 4–6 h, with 100 ng/ml recombinant TRAIL plus 10-fold excess of enhancer for 6–8 h, or with 10 μg/ml etoposide for 16–18 h. Cells were irradiated with 30 gray using a 137Cs source (415 Ci; Von Gahlen Nederland, B.V.) and incubated for 16–18 h. Apoptosis Assays—To measure nuclear fragmentation (subdiploid DNA content), cells were lysed in 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate, 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI) (35Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4431) Google Scholar). Fluorescence intensity of PI-stained nuclei was determined on a FACScan (BD Biosciences), and data were analyzed using Cellquest software. Levels of active caspase-3 were determined as follows. After stimulation, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% saponin and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and stained for 45 min on ice with phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-active caspase-3 mAb in PBS with 0.1% saponin and 0.5% BSA. Subsequently, cells were washed and analyzed by flow cytometry. For determination of apoptosis inflicted by the cytotoxic JS/J clones, effector T cells and J16 target cells were co-cultured in 24-well plates at the indicated ratios and subsequently washed in PBS, fixed for 2 h at -20 °C with 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 100 μg/ml RNase and 20 μg/ml PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan. Percentage of subdiploid PI-positive particles was scored as percentage apoptosis. Background apoptosis in effector and target cells that had been cultured alone was minimal but subtracted from the percentage apoptosis determined in all co-cultures. Immunoblotting—For monitoring Cyt c release, stimulated cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, suspended in 100 μl of extraction buffer (50 mm PIPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm EGTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors), and allowed to swell on ice for 30 min. Cells were homogenized by passing the suspension through a 25-gauge needle (10 strokes). Homogenates were centrifuged in a Beckman Airfuge at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were harvested as cytosolic fractions. Fifteen μg of cytosolic protein, as determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad), were loaded per lane onto 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. For monitoring protein expression levels or caspase processing, cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 10 mm triethanolamine HCl, pH 7.6, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and analyzed for protein content by Bio-Rad protein assay. Equal amounts of protein (50–75 μg per lane) were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose sheets. After transfer, membranes were blocked for 1 h in PBS, 0.05% Tween with 5% not-fat dry milk and probed in PBS, 0.05% Tween with 7H8.2C12 anti-Cyt c mAb (1:1000) and anti-actin mAb (1:10,000), or with anticaspase-2 (1:1000), anti-Bid (1:1000), or anti-caspase-9 antibodies (1: 2000). After incubation with a 1:7500 dilution of the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, immunostained proteins were visualized by ECL. Isolation of Mitochondria—Mouse liver cells were lysed by Dounce homogenization in mitochondrion incubation buffer (MIB): 5 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% (w/v) BSA, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (36Petit P.X. O'Connor J.E. Grunwald D. Brown S.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 389-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and a pellet containing mitochondria was obtained by a spin at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was suspended in MIB and layered on a gradient consisting of layers of 10, 18, 30, and 70% Percoll in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 225 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, and 0.1% (w/v) BSA. Purified mitochondria were collected at the 30/70% Percoll interphase after centrifugation in an SW-41 rotor for 35 min at 13,500 × g at 4 °C. The harvested fraction was diluted at least 5-fold in MIB and centrifuged for 10 min at 6,300 × g at 4 °C. After two more washes in MIB, mitochondria were suspended in Wang buffer B, which is 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 220 mm mannitol, 68 mm sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (10Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar) to a protein concentration of 5 mg/ml. In Vitro Mitochondrion Assay—Cytosols were prepared by hypotonic lysis as described above in Wang buffer B with 10 mm KCl and subsequently incubated with anti-Bid or normal rabbit serum and protein A-Sepharose beads five times for 1 h at 4 °C. Purified mitochondria (25 μg/sample) were incubated with 100 μg of cytosolic protein in a final volume of 30 μl of Wang buffer B at 30 °C for 1 h and subsequently centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000 × g at 4 °C. Mitochondrial pellets were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated by 15% SDS-PAGE at 12.5 μg of protein/sample. Immunoblotting for Cyt c content was performed as described above. Flow Cytometric Analysis of Cyt c Release—Cells were analyzed for Cyt c content by intracellular fluorescence of digitonin-permeabilized and subsequently fixed cells, according to a protocol published previously (37Waterhouse N.J. Trappani J.A. Cell Death Differ. 2003; 10: 853-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This method relies on the fact that digitonin permeabilizes the plasma membrane but not the mitochondrial membrane. Prior to permeabilization, cells were washed twice in PBS. Anti-Cyt c mAb 6H2.B4 was used at a 1:100 dilution and a Cy5-conjugated goat antimouse Ig antibody (Molecular Probes) at a 1:100 dilution. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur and Cellquest software (BD Biosciences). Retroviral Gene Transduction—cDNAs encoding Bcl-2, BidD60E/D75E, dominant negative (dn) FADD, c-FlipL (32Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40760-40767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), the dn active site mutant C287A of caspase-9, and carboxyl-terminally HA-tagged PI-9 (a gift from Dr. J. P. Medema, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands) were cloned into LZRS-IRES-Zeo/pBR (Bcl-2) or LZRS-IRES-GFP (other cDNA), both derivatives of LZRS-pBMN-lacZ, which was provided by Dr. G. Nolan (Stanford University School of Medicine, San Francisco). LZRS-IRES-GFP with carboxyl-terminally VSV-tagged SPI-6 cDNA and pMX-IRES-GFP with CrmA cDNA were kindly provided by J. P. Medema. Retrovirus production and transduction were carried out as described previously (32Werner A.B. de Vries E. Tait S.W. Bontjer I. Borst J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40760-40767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Transduced cells were selected for enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression using a MoFlo high speed cell sorter (Cytomation, Fort Collins, CO). Stable Knock Down of Human Caspase-2 by Short Interfering (si)RNA—pSUPER-GFP (a gift from Dr. H. Spits and R. Schotte, Amsterdam Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is identical to the pSUPER vector described previously (38Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar), except that it expresses GFP under a phosphoglycerate kinase promoter. Complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides (caspase-2 si II sense oligo 5′-acagctgttgttgagcgaa-3′, caspase-2 si III sense oligo 5′-tgcaagagaaactgcagaa-3′) were annealed and cloned into pSUPER-GFP. The siRNA GFP cassette was cloned into pSin, an LZRS-based retroviral vector that allows expression of the siRNA under a polymerase III promoter (kindly provided by Dr. H. Spits and R. Schotte). Packaging cell supernatants containing ecotropic retrovirus encoding caspase-2 si II and caspase-2 si III were used to transduce J16 cells expressing the ecotropic retroviral receptor (39Baker B.W. Boettiger D. Spooncer E. Norton J.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). (This receptor was introduced by stable transduction of the cDNA cloned in pBabe-puro and selection by puromycin.) Transduced cells expressing caspase-2 si constructs were selected for GFP expression using a MoFlo high speed cell sorter. Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA)—The principle of MLPA has been described previously (40Schouten J.P. McElgunn C.J. Waaijer R. Zwijnenburg D. Diepvens F. Pals G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: e57Crossref PubMed Scopus (2110) Google Scholar). This method allows amplification and quantitative analysis of transcripts from multiple genes in a one-tube assay. Total RNA was prepared from non-stimulated or 3-, 6-, or 9-h etoposide-stimulated or γ-irradiated J16 cells by the Trizol method and reverse-transcribed by using a gene-specific oligonucleotide probe mix. The resulting cDNA was annealed overnight to the MLPA probe mix. Probes used in this study were designed to hybridize with cDNA of 36 human apoptosis-related genes. Detailed reaction conditions for MLPA with these particular probes and their performance have been described (41Eldering E. Spek C.A. Aberson H. Grummels A. Derks I. de Vos A. McElgunn C. Schouten J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e153Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The annealed oligonucleotides and cDNAs were ligated, and products were amplified by PCR, with one unlabeled and one fluorescently labeled primer. The resulting DNA mixture was analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3100 capillary sequencer with GeneScan and Genotyper software packages (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). As expression of housekeeping genes varied minimally throughout the time courses, the sum of the fluorescence intensities of all products amplified in one reaction was set at 100% to correct for fluctuations in total signal between samples, and individual peaks were calculated relative to the 100% value. Common Signaling Requirements for Apoptosis Induction by DNA-damaging Anti-cancer Regimens and Death Receptors—In wild-type J16 Jurkat T cells, apoptosis induction by the topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide and γ-radiation shares aspects with apoptosis induction by the death receptor CD95. This was first discovered when variant Jurkat cells, selected for resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis, proved cross-resistant to"

Computer-assisted sequence analysis revealed that the hmi-er1 promoter region contains a CpG island but lacks an identifiable TATA element, initiator sequence and downstream promoter element. This genomic DNA was able to direct transcription of a luciferase reporter gene in a variety of human cell lines, and the minimal promoter was shown to be located within–68/+144 bp. Several putative Sp1 binding sites were identified, and we show that Sp1 can bind to the hmi-er1 minimal promoter and increase transcription, suggesting that the level of hmi-er1 expression may depend on the availability of Sp1 protein. Functional analysis revealed that hMI-ER1 represses Sp1-activated transcription from the minimal promoter by a histone deacetylase-independent mechanism. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that both Sp1 and hMI-ER1 are associated with the chromatin of the hmi-er1 promoter and that overexpression of hMI-ER1 in cell lines that allow Tet-On-inducible expression resulted in loss of detectable Sp1 from the endogenous hmi-er1 promoter. The mechanism by which this occurs does not involve binding of hMI-ER1 to cis-acting elements. Instead, we show that hMI-ER1 physically associates with Sp1 and that endogenous complexes containing the two proteins could be detected in vivo. Furthermore, hMI-ER1 specifically interferes with binding of Sp1 to the hmi-er1 minimal promoter as well as to an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. Deletion analysis revealed that this interaction occurs through a region containing the SANT domain of hMI-ER1. Together, these data reveal a functional role for the SANT domain in the action of co-repressor regulatory factors and suggest that the association of hMI-ER1 with Sp1 represents a novel mechanism for the negative regulation of Sp1 target promoters. ld;&.2qTo gain insight into the regulation of hmi-er1 expression, we cloned a human genomic DNA fragment containing one of the two hmi-er1 promoters and consisting of 1460 bp upstream of the translation initiation codon of hMI-ER1.

Ding Z. Lew Y.-Y. Nash G.N. Mercer F.C. Gillespie L.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Two of the N-terminal variants differ in the sequence of their 5′-UTR, 1The abbreviations used are: UTR, untranslated region; aa, amino acid; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; DTBP, 3–3′ dithiobispropionimidate-2HCl; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HDAC, histone deacetylase; TSA, trichostatin A; RLU, relative luciferase units; IP, immunoprecipitation; dox, doxycycline. whereas the third contains an additional exon that encodes 25 amino acids (aa). The C-terminal variants, hMI-ER1α and -β, differ both in the size and sequence of their C-terminal domains: the α C terminus consists of 23 aa and includes an LXXLL motif, a domain known to be important for interaction with nuclear hormone receptors (5Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar). In this regard, the α isoform mRNA is only detectable in endocrine tissues (4Paterno G.D. Ding Z. Lew Y.-Y. Nash G.N. Mercer F.C. Gillespie L.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The β C terminus contains 102 aa and includes the only functional nuclear localization signal (4Paterno G.D. Ding Z. Lew Y.-Y. Nash G.N. Mercer F.C. Gillespie L.L.

Whereas the divergent C-terminal amino acid sequences would suggest that these two isoforms have distinct functions, so far no difference in function has been determined. Instead, both isoforms can act as transcriptional repressors, and this repression was shown to involve recruitment of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The common internal sequence of hMI-ER1 contains conserved domains found in a number of transcriptional regulators, including an acid activation domain (1Paterno G.D. Li Y. Luchman H.A. Ryan P.J. Gillespie L.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25591-25595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), an ELM2 domain (7Solari F. Bateman A. Ahringer J. Development. 1999; 126: 2483-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a signature SANT domain (8Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In a recent report, we showed that the ELM2 domain functions in the recruitment of HDAC1 and transcriptional repression (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The SANT domain is located immediately downstream of the ELM2 domain and, in other proteins, has been implicated in DNA binding as well as in protein-protein interactions (8Aasland R. Stewart A.F. Gibson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 87-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar), including interactions with histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)- and histone acetyltransferase-containing complexes (9Guenther M.G.

Lazar M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3403-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Recently, the SANT domain of the nuclear receptor corepressor SMRT has been implicated in the ability of this protein to target specific promoters through interpretation of the so-called histone code (12Yu J. Li Y. Ishizuka T. Guenther M.G. Lazar M.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3403-3410Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). To date, no function has been ascribed to the SANT domain of hMI-ER1. In this report, we investigate mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the hmi-er1 P2 promoter and demonstrate that promoter activity is regulated by Sp1 protein and that this activation is repressed in a dose-dependent manner by hMI-ER1 protein. This autorepression does not depend upon HDAC activity but involves interference of Sp1 binding to the chromatin surrounding the hmi-er1 P2 promoter and from the cognate binding sites by physical association with a region containing the hMI-ER1 SANT domain. This represents a novel mechanism for negative regulation of Sp1 target promoters and a functional role for the SANT domain in the activity of co-repressor regulatory factors. Cell Lines—All cell lines were obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection and cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Plasmids and Constructs—A 1460-bp sequence, containing 144 bp of hmi-er1 5′-UTR and 1316 bp of 5′-flanking genomic sequence, was generated by PCR from human genomic DNA, using the primer pairs listed in Table I. The PCR product (–1316) was cloned into the pCR2.1 vector (pCR(–1316)), using the TOPO-TA cloning kit (Invitrogen) and sequenced on both strands.

The other deletion mutants were constructed by PCR, using the primer pairs listed in Table I; the PCR products were cloned into pCR2.1 and then subcloned into pGL3-Basic, using either the XhoI/HindIII sites (pGL3(–469), pGL3(–312), and pGL3(+28)) or the KpnI/XhoI sites (pGL3(–945) and pGL3(–68)). Myc-tagged plasmids (CS3+MT) containing either full-length hmi-er1α (pMyc-α) or β (pMyc-β) have been previously described (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Human Sp1 cDNA was obtained from Dr. Robert Tjian (University of California, Berkeley) and subcloned into pCR3.1, using 5′-caagatcactccatggatgaaatgacag-3′ and 5′-tgcctgatctcagaagccattgcca-3′ as forward and reverse primers, respectively. To obtain GST-hmi-er1α or β fusion constructs, cDNA representing the appropriate isoform was subcloned in-frame into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (Amersham Biosciences). A series of hMI-ER1 deletion mutations was generated by first amplifying fragments encoding the appropriate amino acid residues of hMI-ER1α or -β, using the primer pairs listed in Table I. PCR products were cloned into pCR3.1, and EcoRI fragments were then inserted into the complementary sites of the pGEX-4T-1 plasmid. Deletion constructs were named according to the encoded amino acid residues of the hMI-ER1α or -β proteins. The GST-Sp1 fusion was constructed by subcloning an Sp1 EcoRI fragment from Sp1-pCR3.1 in-frame into pGEX-4T-2. Computer Analysis of the hmi-er1 Promoter Region—Computer-assisted analysis was performed using the following programs: 1) for promoter prediction: Promoter Scan (PROSCAN) available on the World Wide Web at bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/proscan/ and Neural Network PromoterPrediction (NNPP) available at www.fruitfly.org/seq_tools/promoter.html; 2) for CpG islands: Webgene available on the World Wide Web at www.itba.mi.cnr.it/webgene; 3) for transcription factor binding sites: Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFSEARCH) available on the World Wide Web at www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCHJ.html, Transcription Element Search System (TESS) at www.cbil.upenn.edu/tess/, and PROSCAN. Transfection and Reporter Assays—All transfections and TSA treatments were performed as previously described (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), in duplicate in 6-well plates, using the indicated amount of plasmid DNA, and cells were harvested after 48 h in culture. Luciferase assays were performed on cell lysates using a Monolight 2010 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory) and a luciferase assay reagent (Promega), according to the manufacturer's directions. The values obtained, in relative luciferase units (RLU), were normalized to the amount of cellular protein in each sample and plotted either as a -fold increase over that obtained with the control vector or as a percentage of control activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed as in (13Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Briefly, the double-stranded consensus Sp1 oligonucleotides (Promega) or the minimal functional promoter fragment (–68 to +144) was labeled with [λ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified on NucTrap probe purification columns (Stratagene, Inc.). The labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides were incubated with 2 μl of HeLa nuclear extract (Promega) or GST fusion protein at room temperature for 20 min in 20 μl of reaction buffer containing 5% glycerol, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm KCl, 10 μm ZnSO4, 85 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5). Poly(dI-dC) was used as a heterologous competitor in the reaction (2 μg/reaction). Where indicated, a 20-fold molar excess of unlabeled probe was included in the binding reaction. For antibody supershift assays, the extract was incubated for 30 min at room temperature with Sp1-specific antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Bound and free probes were resolved by nondenaturing electrophoresis on 4% polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by autoradiography. GST Fusion Protein Production—GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified according to the instructions supplied with the pGEX-4T-1 and pGEX-4T-2 vectors. GST fusion protein level and purity were determined by SDS-PAGE. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), GST Pull-down Assays and Western Blot Analysis—Coupled transcription-translation (TNT; Promega) reactions and in vitro co-IP assays were performed as in Ding et al. (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell.

Kao, Memorial University). Pull-down assays with GST fusion proteins were performed as described in Ref. 14Routledge E.J. White R. Parker M.G. Sumpter J.P. J. Biol.

Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For all assays, one-twentieth volume of the indicated TNT was loaded into the input lanes. For the in vivo co-IP assays, either nontransfected HeLa cells or cells transfected with pMyc, pMyc-α, or pMyc-β were used. Immunoprecipitation using anti-Sp1 or anti-pan-hMI-ER1 (4Paterno G.D.

Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Input lanes contained one-third of the volume used for immunoprecipitation. Establishment of Stable hMI-ER1α and -β Tet-On HeLa Cell Lines and Doxycycline Induction—hMI-ER1α and β Tet-On HeLa cell lines were generated using the hmi-er1α or -β coding region inserted into the pTRE2 vector and a Tet-On gene expression system (Clontech), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Control cell lines were generated by transfection with the pTRE2 empty vector. Stable clones were induced to express hMI-ER1α or -β using 2 μg/ml doxycycline (dox), and expression was verified by Western blot analysis of whole cell extracts, using an anti-hMI-ER1 antibody (4Paterno G.D.

Quantitative real time PCR was performed using the Syber Green PCR Master Mix and the ABI Prism 7000 SDS (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The 5′-UTR of hmi-er1 was amplified using 5′-AGTGGCGGCGGGAGCGGCAGAGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-CGTACTGCCGGGTCACATCTCC-3′ (reverse), whereas β-actin was amplified using 5′-ATCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3′ (F) and 5′-ATGGCTGGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTC-3′ (R).

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays—Chromatin from HeLa cells or dox-induced Tet-On cell lines was cross-linked with formaldehyde, sheared, and then subjected to immunoprecipitation as described by Weinmann et al.

Cloning of hmi-er1 5′ Regulatory Sequence and Identification of the Minimal Functional Promoter—A genomic DNA fragment encompassing the promoter region, P2 (4Paterno G.D. Ding Z. Lew Y.-Y. Nash G.N. Mercer F.C. Gillespie L.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), and containing 1460 bp upstream of the ATG translational start codon of hmi-er1 was isolated by PCR from human genomic DNA. This sequence contains 144 bp of 5′-UTR (+1 to +144) and 1316 bp (–1 to –1316) upstream of the start of transcription (4Paterno G.D. Ding Z. Lew Y.-Y. Nash G.N. Mercer F.C. Gillespie L.L. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 295: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Computer-assisted analysis of the 1460-bp fragment to identify potential cis-regulatory elements predicted a CpG island located between nucleotide position –389 and the start of translation (Fig. 1A). Further analysis revealed that, like many other GC-rich promoters, the upstream sequence does not contain a TATA box; nor does it contain an initiator (18Smale S.T. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 57: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1151) Google Scholar) or a downstream promoter element (19Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). A number of potential transcription factor binding sites, including multiple Sp1 binding sites, were identified using TFSEARCH, PROSCAN, and TESS (Fig. 1A). The 1460-bp fragment was subcloned into the promoterless luciferase reporter vector, pGL3-Basic, in sense and antisense orientations, and its promoter activity was analyzed in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, luciferase activity was 8–10-fold higher when expression was driven by the 1460-bp fragment, compared with the pGL3-Basic vector and was markedly lower when the 1460-bp fragment was in the antisense orientation. We tested the cellular specificity of the hmi-er1 promoter in six different cell lines: C33A, HEK293, BT-20, MCF-7, SK-OV-3, and U87. Luciferase activity was high in all transfected cell lines and ranged from 10- to 34-fold higher than control levels, demonstrating that the hmi-er1 promoter can function in a variety of cell types (data not shown). To identify the minimal functional region of the hmi-er1 promoter, a series of 5′ deletions was constructed in pGL3 and transiently transfected into HeLa cells. Deletion of nucleotides –1316 to –133 resulted in little change in luciferase activity (Fig. 1B). Further deletion to nucleotide –68 reduced but did not abolish luciferase activity, whereas deletion to nucleotide +28 completely abolished activity (Fig. 1B). These data demonstrate that the minimal functional promoter is located within the sequence –68/+144. The hmi-er1 minimal promoter is predicted to contain four Sp1 binding sites (Fig. 1A); therefore, we investigated whether Sp1 binds to this sequence. EMSAs were performed using a HeLa cell nuclear extract and a probe consisting of the minimal promoter sequence (–68/+144). Two bands representing DNA-protein complexes appeared in samples containing nuclear extract (Fig. 1C, lane 2); however, only the larger complex was specific, as revealed by competition with excess unlabeled probe (Fig. 1C, lane 3). Supershift assays, using an Sp1 antibody that does not cross-react with Sp2, Sp3, or Sp4, resulted in the appearance of a higher mobility band that disappeared in the presence of excess unlabeled probe (Fig. 1C, lanes 4 and 5), thus confirming the presence of Sp1 in the DNA-protein complexes. hMI-ER1α and -β Repress Activation of the Minimal Promoter by Sp1—The ability of Sp1 to regulate transcription from the hmi-er1 promoter was investigated in vivo using luciferase reporter assays. HeLa cells were co-transfected with a luciferase reporter construct containing the minimal promoter sequence –68/+144 (pGL3(–68)), along with an Sp1 expression vector (pCR-Sp1) or control empty vector (pCR). Co-transfection with Sp1 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity to 4-fold that of control (Fig. 2A), demonstrating that Sp1 can activate transcription from the hmi-er1 minimal promoter, either directly or indirectly. We have shown previously that hMI-ER1 functions as a HDAC-dependent transcriptional repressor (2Ding Z. Gillespie L.L. Paterno G.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 250-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar); therefore, we investigated whether hMI-ER1 could regulate transcription from its own promoter. HeLa cells were co-transfected with pGL3(–68) along with a plasmid expressing Myc tag alone (pMyc) or fused to hMI-ERα (pMyc-α) or hMI-ER1β (pMyc-β). Myc-α and Myc-β repressed the activity of the hmi-er1 minimal promoter to 40 and 33% of control, respectively (Fig. 2B). The HDAC dependence of this repression was determined by assaying in the presence of TSA. Fig. 2C revealed that repression was not relieved by TSA, demonstrating that hMI-ER1 represses its own promoter by a HDAC-independent mechanism. An obvious question is whether hMI-ER1α and -β can affect transcriptional activation by Sp1. To investigate this, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pGL3(–68), pCR-Sp1, and increasing concentrations of pMyc, pMyc-α, or pMyc-β. Promoter activation by Sp1 was repressed in a dose-dependent manner by both hMI-ER1α and -β (Fig. 3), and repression resulted in a 50% reduction in luciferase activity at the highest hMI-ER1 levels. This repression was not due to a down-regulation of Sp1 protein, which remained constant at all hMI-ER1 levels (Fig. 3). We have confirmed that this repression also occurs at the level of the endogenous hmi-er1 gene, using dox-inducible hMI-ER1 HeLa cell lines (Fig. 4A). We treated hMI-ER1α-expressing (HTα222), hMI-ER1β-expressing (HTβ53), and control (HTC314) cell lines with 2 μg/ml dox to induce hMI-ER1 expression and then extracted RNA for real time RT-PCR and for semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis. We compared changes in the steady state levels of endogenous hmi-er1 mRNA using primers in the noncoding region of hmi-er1 that are absent in the transfected construct. Fig. 4B shows that dox-induced expression of hMI-ER1 reduced steady state levels of endogenous hmi-er1 mRNA by 50% in HTα222 cells and 42% in HTβ53 cells, relative to the expression level in HTC314 cells. This level of repression is consistent with the level of repression by hMI-ER1 observed in transient transfection approaches reported in Fig. 3A. A similar reduction in the expression level of endogenous hmi-er1 mRNA was observed using semiquantitative PCR (Fig. 4C). As expected, amplification using primers in the coding region revealed an increase in the total hmi-er1 mRNA expression level, due to dox induction of the transfected hmi-er1 cDNA, whereas no discernable effect of the steady state levels of endogenous β-actin was observed (Fig. 4C). hMI-ER1 Is Associated with the Chromatin of Its Own Promoter and Interferes with Sp1 Binding—Although we have demonstrated that Sp1 can bind to recognition sequences in the hmi-er1 promoter, it is important to demonstrate that endogenous Sp1 can associate with the hmi-er1 promoter in vivo. Therefore, we performed ChIP assays using HeLa cells to investigate this possibility. Formaldehyde-cross-linked, sheared chromatin"
https://openalex.org/W2065380476,"During fermentation, yeast cells are exposed to increasing amounts of alcohol, which is stressful and affects both growth and viability. On the molecular level, numerous aspects of alcohol stress signaling remain unresolved. We have identified a novel yeast Ring/PHD finger protein that constitutively shuttles between nucleus and cytoplasm but accumulates in the nucleus upon exposure to ethanol, 2-propanol, or 1-butanol. Subcellular localization of this protein is not altered by osmotic, oxidative, or heat stress or during nitrogen or glucose starvation. Because of its exclusive sensitivity to environmental alcohol, the protein was called Asr1p for Alcohol Sensitive Ring/PHD finger 1 protein. Nuclear accumulation of Asr1p is rapid, reversible, and requires a functional Ran/Gsp1p gradient. Asr1p contains two N terminally located leucine-rich nuclear export sequences (NES) required for nuclear export. Consistently, it accumulates in the nucleus of xpo1-1 cells at restrictive temperature and forms a trimeric complex with the exportin Xpo1p and Ran-GTP. Deletion of ASR1 leads to sensitivity in growth on medium containing alcohol or detergent, consistent with a function of Asr1p in alcohol-related signaling. Asr1p is the first reported protein that changes its subcellular localization specifically upon exposure to alcohol and therefore represents a key element in the analysis of alcohol-responsive signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2056205091,"Two pulsars (PSR J0737–3039A1 and B2) were recently discovered in highly relativistic orbits around one another. The system contains a rapidly rotating pulsar with a spin period of 22.7 ms and a slow companion with a spin period of 2.77 s, referred to here as ‘A’ and ‘B’, respectively. A unique property of the system is that the pulsed radio flux from B increases systematically by almost two orders of magnitude during two short portions of its orbit2. Here we report a geometrical model of the system that simultaneously explains the intensity variations of B and provides constraints on the spin axis orientation and emission geometry of A. Our model assumes that B's pulsed radio flux increases when illuminated by emission from A. We predict that A's pulse profile will evolve considerably over the next several years owing to geodetic precession until it disappears entirely in 15–20 years."

The first stage of the reaction is a β-elimination that involves a very fast interconversion of the internal aldimine in a highly fluorescent L-serine external aldimine that decays, via the α-carbon proton removal and β-hydroxyl group release, to the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base. This reaction is influenced by protons, monovalent cations, and α-subunit ligands that modulate the distribution between open and closed conformations. In order to identify the ionizable residues that might assist catalysis, we have investigated the pH dependence of the rate of the external aldimine decay by rapid scanning UV-visible absorption and single wavelength fluorescence stopped flow. In the pH range 6-9, the reaction was found to be biphasic with the first phase (rate constants k1) accounting for more than 70% of the signal change. In the absence of monovalent cations or in the presence of sodium and potassium ions, the pH dependence of k1 exhibits a bell shaped profile characterized by a pKa1 of about 6 and a pKa2 of about 9, whereas in the presence of cesium ions, the pH dependence exhibits a saturation profile characterized by a single pKa of 9. The presence of the allosteric effector indole acetylglycine increases the rate of reaction without altering the pH profile and pKa values. By combining structural information for the internal aldimine, the external aldimine, and the α-aminoacrylate with kinetic data on the wild type enzyme and β-active site mutants, we have tentatively assigned pKa1 to βAsp-305 and pKa2 to βLys-87.

Open conformations are endowed with low activity, and closed conformations are endowed with high activity. Tryptophan synthase is a bienzyme that catalyzes the last two steps of L-tryptophan biosynthesis. It is a tetrameric molecule composed of two α- and two β-subunits, forming a linear αββα complex (15Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The β-subunit contains a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate molecule bound via a Schiff base to βLys-87. The overall reaction is shown in Reaction 1,indole−3−glycerolphosphate+l−serine→l−tryptophan+d−glyceraldehyde−3−phosphate+H2OREACTION 1 Two distinct reactions take place in the α- and β-active sites that are physically separated but connected by an intramolecular channel (15Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Padlan E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as shown in Reactions 2 and 3,α site indole 3−glycerolphosphate→indole+d−glyceraldehyde 3−phosphateREACTION 2 β site indole+l−serine→l−tryptophan+H2OREACTION 3 The α-reaction is a concerted catalytic event involving residues Glu-49 and Asp-60, as determined by kinetic and structural studies carried out on the wild type enzyme as well as on several mutants (2Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1991; 64: 93-172PubMed Google Scholar). The β-reaction is a more complex process (Scheme 1), requiring the combined action of PLP and several catalytic residues. The mechanism has been inferred by exploiting the distinct spectral properties of transiently accumulating PLP intermediates (1Miles E.W. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1979; 49: 127-186PubMed Google Scholar). The internal aldimine absorbs at 412 nm with a minor band at 340 nm. These bands have been attributed to the ketoenamine and enolimine tautomers, respectively (16Faeder E.J. Hammes G.G. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 4043-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The substrate L-serine binds forming a gem-diamine complex, characterized by an absorption spectrum centered at 320-330 nm that rapidly converts to a metastable external aldimine. This species absorbs at 420 nm and is the only significantly fluorescent catalytic intermediate (17Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 120: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19York S.S.

Benci S. Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Biophys. Chem. 1996; 61: 9-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The removal of the α-proton leads to the formation of a quinonoid species absorbing around 460 nm. This intermediate is particularly labile, and the experimental evidence of its formation is indirect (22Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The release of the hydroxyl moiety on the β-carbon completes the first catalytic stage, i.e. the β-elimination reaction, with the formation of the α-aminoacrylate. This key catalytic intermediate predominantly absorbs at 350-360 nm extending with broad bands at 470 nm. These bands have been attributed to either the enolimine and ketoenamine tautomers, respectively (23Peracchi A. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9459-9465Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), or to an unprotonated and protonated aminoacrylate Schiff base, respectively (24Hur O. Niks D. Casino P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9991-10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In tyrosine phenol-lyase and tryptophan indole-lyase, the predominant form of the α-aminoacrylate absorbs at 350 nm (25Phillips R.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5927-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), whereas in O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase, the predominant form absorbs at 470 nm (26Schnackerz K.D. Tai C.H. Simmons III, J.W. Jacobson T.M. Rao G.S. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12152-12160Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the second stage of the catalytic reaction, indole, channeled from the α-active site, reacts with the α-aminoacrylate double bond forming a quinonoid species that absorbs at about 470 nm. By accepting a proton, the quinonoid species interconverts to the external aldimine of L-tryptophan, absorbing at about 425 nm and devoid of fluorescent properties (27Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The release of L-tryptophan completes the catalytic cycle regenerating the internal aldimine. Several catalytic properties of TS were found to be influenced by pH as follows. (i) The accumulation of the quinonoid species formed in the second stage of the β-reaction increases with pH (28Goldberg M.E. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 2113-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 29Mozzarelli A. Peracchi A. Rovegno B. Dale G. Rossi G.L. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6956-6962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). (ii) The rate-limiting step of the catalytic reaction, carried out by Escherichia coli enzyme, varies as a function of pH, being the Cα proton removal at pH 6.5 and L-tryptophan release at pH 7.6 (18Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 571-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 30Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). (iii) The steady-state parameters of Salmonella typhimurium wild type TS are pH-dependent, indicating the presence of at least three ionizable residues with pKa1 = 6.5, pKa2 = 7.25, and pKa3 = 8.2-9 (31Ro H.S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31189-31194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). (iv) The pH dependence of β-replacement and β-elimination activity was found to be significantly altered in the βHis-86 → Leu mutant (32Ro H.S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36439-36445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). (v) The external aldimine accumulation is favored at high pH both in solution and in the crystalline state, whereas the α-aminoacrylate is stabilized at low pH (32Ro H.S. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36439-36445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Peracchi A. Bettati S. Mozzarelli A. Rossi G.L. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F.

Chem. 1989; 264: 15774-15780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). (vi) The conversion of the external aldimine to the aminoacrylate is accompanied by the release of a proton originating from the Schiff base nitrogen (24Hur O. Niks D. Casino P. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9991-10001Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, no studies have addressed the pH dependence of the catalytic rates on the S. typhimurium enzyme, the form for which the three-dimensional structure of the internal aldimine (12Schneider T.R.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5394-5406Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) has been determined. Recently, it was also found that monovalent cations and α-subunit ligands affect the distribution of intermediates as well as the catalytic properties of TS, triggering regulatory signals and stabilizing alternative open and closed conformations of the α-and β-subunits (23Peracchi A.

We have investigated the pH dependence of the catalytic rates in the absence and presence of monovalent cations and indole acetylglycine (IAG), a recently discovered α-subunit ligand (13Marabotti A.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1476: 287-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Here we describe our results on the first stage of the catalytic reaction, the β-elimination, using both rapid scanning UV-visible spectroscopy and single wavelength fluorescence stopped-flow methods. The second stage, the β-addition that completes the β-replacement reaction catalyzed by TS, will be described in a subsequent paper. Chemicals and Buffers—Bistris propane, Bicine, l-serine, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, cesium chloride, and IAG were purchased from Sigma. Reagents were of the highest quality commercially available and were used without further purification. Experiments were carried out in solutions containing 25 mm Bistris propane, a metal-free buffer. pH measurements were carried out with a Radiometer pHM83 pH meter, equipped with an Ingold-Mettler LoT406-M3 microelectrode, calibrated with three standard buffers. To obtain the desired pH, HCl was added to solutions. Enzyme Preparation—The tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from S. typhimurium was purified as described previously (43Yang L. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The enzyme was stored in 50 mm Bicine buffer, 20 μm PLP, pH 7.8, at -80 °C. Prior to use, the enzyme was extensively dialyzed against 25 mm Bistris propane, pH 7.8. Kinetic Measurements—Single wavelength kinetic experiments were carried out with a temperature-controlled stopped-flow apparatus, manufactured by Applied Photophysics, using a 75-watt xenon lamp as a light source and a photomultiplier as a detector. The instrumental dead time was 1.5 ms. Rapid spectral scanning stopped-flow measurements were carried out with the same apparatus, using a 150-watt xenon lamp, coupled to a MS 125™ 1/8-m spectrograph and an Insta-spec II photodiode array, manufactured by Lot-Oriel. One syringe contained 2.5 mg/ml TS in 25 mm Bistris propane, in the absence and presence of either 250 mm NaCl, 100 mm KCl, or 100 mm CsCl, at the appropriate pH. The second syringe contained 25 mm Bistris propane, 100 mm l-serine, and either no salt or an equal concentration of salt, with or without 2 mm IAG, at the same pH of the first syringe. The pH of the mixed solution was always determined at the end of the experiment. Control experiments carried out with monovalent cations in only one syringe showed the same rate constants and amplitudes. Experiments were carried out over the pH range 6-9 and at 20 °C to ensure enzyme stability. The formation and decay of the external aldimine of l-serine were followed by monitoring fluorescence emission, upon excitation at 420 nm. Kinetic traces at single wavelength were recorded by collecting 1000 data points on a logarithmic scale in 10 s. The photodiode array system collects spectra every 0.0084 s with a 16-μs readout time per pixel. In a typical experiment, background and reference spectra are first collected and stored. In a kinetic series, up to 150 spectra were collected between 335 and 470 nm, in about 1 s. Data Analysis—Time courses were fitted with Equation 1 describing a biphasic decay, y=y0+ae−k1+be−k2 (Eq. 1) where y0 is the floating end point value of the spectroscopic signal; a and b are the amplitudes of the two phases, and k1 and k2 are the corresponding rate constants. The pH dependence of the rate constants was fitted with Equations 2 and 3 for two residues or a single ionizable residue (44Sam M.D. Perona J.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 6576-6586Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), k=kmax/(1+10−pH/10−pKa1+10−pKa2/10−pH+10−pKa2/10−pKa1) (Eq. 2) k=kmax/(1+10−pKa1/10−pH)(Eq. 3) where kmax represents the maximum value of the rate, and pKa1 and pKa2 are the pKa values of the ionizable groups. The program Sigma Plot 2000 (SPSS Science) was used to fit the data. HINT Analysis—The HINT software quantitatively estimates every atom-atom interaction through the equation bij = aiSiaj Sj Tij Rij + rij, where bij represents the score value of interacting atoms i and j; a represents the hydrophobic atom constant (45Kellogg G.E. Semus S.F. Abraham D.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1991; 5: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 46Kellogg G.E. Abraham D.J. Eur. J. Med. Chem. 2000; 35: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 47Kellogg G.E. Burnett J.C. Abraham D.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 2001; 15: 381-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), calculated with an adaptation of the fragment constant methods of Abraham and Leo (48Abraham D.J. Leo A.J. Proteins. 1987; 2: 130-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar); S represents the solvent (water)-accessible surface area; Tij represents a logic function assuming a +1/-1 value depending on the character of interacting polar atoms; Rij represents the exponential function e-r; and rij represents an implementation of the Lennard-Jones potential. Favorable interactions are positively scored (bij > 0), whereas unfavorable ones are negatively scored (bij < 0). The total score that evaluates the strength of the binding process is ΣiΣjbij = ΣiΣj(aiSiajSjTijRij + rij). Because each atom-atom interaction (bij) is related to a partial free energy variation (δg), the total score (ΣiΣjbij) is automatically correlated to the sum of each δg and, therefore, to global interaction binding free energy (ΔGinteraction) (49Cozzini P. Fornabaio M. Marabotti A. Abraham D.J. Kellogg G.E. Mozzarelli A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2469-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 50Fornabaio M. Cozzini P. Mozzarelli A. Abraham D.J.

The entropic contribution given by the release of water to bulk, which follows molecular association, is implicitly incorporated in the hydrophobic atom constants derived from partition measurements (53Cozzini P. Fornabaio M. Marabotti A. Abraham D.J. Kellogg G.E. Mozzarelli A. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1345-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The HINT procedure consists of two steps as follows: the model building and the hydrophatic analysis, as described previously (49Cozzini P. Fornabaio M. Marabotti A. Abraham D.J. Kellogg G.E. Mozzarelli A. J. Med. Chem. 2002; 45: 2469-2483Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional coordinates of TS derivatives were retrieved from Protein Data Bank and imported into Sybyl (version 6.9, www.tripos.com). The structures were properly modeled, checking atom and bond types and adding hydrogen atoms, using Sybyl tools. The automatic algorithms do not account for intermolecular and intramolecular steric clashes; thus hydrogens were energy-minimized by using Powell algorithm with a gradient of 0.5 kcal (mol Å)-1 for 1500 cycles. The ionizable groups of interacting residues at the binding site were carefully analyzed, and different possible protonation states were considered and computed. The hydropathic analysis was performed with HINT (version 2.35S, www.tripos.com). LogPo/w was calculated for each interacting component using the “All” option. The “Neutral” option was chosen for the solvent condition when the ionization state of residues was not changed, whereas “inferred” was the option adopted for the partition procedure when the ionization state was modified. The HINT score was finally calculated for each couple of interacting residues at the active site. The reaction of TS with L-serine at different pH values, in the absence (Fig. 1, a-c) and presence of sodium (Fig. 1, d-f), potassium (Fig. 1, g-i), and cesium ions (Fig. 1, j-l), was first monitored by rapid scanning stopped flow to detect simultaneously all forming and decaying catalytic intermediates. Such an informative approach was pioneered by Dunn and co-workers (22Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 54Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2494-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The external aldimine with L-serine, absorbing at 422 nm, is formed in 20-30 ms (Fig. 1, spectrum 1, 33 ms) and rapidly decays to accumulate the α-aminoacrylate Schiff base, predominantly absorbing at 350 nm (Fig. 1, spectrum 5, ∼1 s). The amount of transiently formed external aldimine, as well as the relative amount of external aldimine and α-aminoacrylate Schiff base at the end of the reaction, are strongly dependent on pH and monovalent cations. The same reaction was monitored by single wavelength stopped flow by recording the fluorescence emission of the external aldimine, upon excitation at 420 nm, in the absence (Fig. 2a) and presence of 250 mm NaCl (Fig. 2b), 100 mm KCl (Fig. 2c), and 100 mm CsCl (Fig. 2d) at pH values between 6 and 8.8. The kinetics were well fitted to a biexponential process (Table I), as reported previously (22Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 54Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 2494-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Actually, there is a third very slow phase, characterized by a small amplitude, that we neglected, considering it to be catalytically irrelevant, in agreement with other studies (19York S.S. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2733-2740Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 22Drewe Jr., W.F. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 3977-3987Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 30Lane A.N. Kirschner K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 129: 561-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The rate constants determined at pH 7.8 in the absence and presence of sodium or potassium ions are in good agreement with those observed previously (27Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7118-7130Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 39Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7131-7141Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The amplitude of the first phase A1 generally accounted for over 70% of the fluorescence change (Table I) and did not show any pH dependence. In contrast, the corresponding rate k1 (Table I) exhibited either a bell-shaped profile, as in the absence and presence of potassium and sodium ions (Fig. 3a), or a saturating profile, as in the presence of cesium ions (Fig. 3b), indicating that the formation of α-aminoacrylate is controlled by either two or only a single ionizable residue, respectively. The pKa values, determined according to Equations 2 and 3 (see “Materials and Methods”), are reported in Table II. The pKa1 exhibits a value ranging from 5.8 or 5.9, in the presence of sodium and potassium ions, respectively, to 6.4 in the absence of monovalent cations. The pKa2 exhibits values close to 9 for all experimental conditions. An analysis of the pH profile in the presence of cesium ions by using two pKa values leads to a pKa1 of 5.20 and pKa2 of 9.02 with an R2 of 0.83, a value only slightly higher than that (0.78) obtained with the analysis assuming a single pKa (Table II). Both the very small improvement of the quality of the fitting and a value of pKa1 clearly out of the pH range of experimental data make very questionable the presence of two pKa values in the presence of cesium ions. The maximal rate of reaction follows the order: Cs+ > K+ > no ions > Na+. An analysis based on the pH dependence of log k shows very similar pKa values and a slope close to unity, indicating that single ionizable residues are responsible for each pKa (data not shown). Furthermore, the dependence on pH of the rate k2 exhibits a bell shape only in the presence of sodium ions (Table I).Fig. 2Time courses for the reaction of TS with l-serine.

https://openalex.org/W2106531906,"The activity of acid phosphatase (ACP) in insect fat bodies is stimulated by the steroid hormone 20-hydoxyecdysone (20E) in vivo. However, in fat bodies kept in culture, a factor from the hemolymph is required to enhance the ACP activity. We identified the factor as a protein with a molecular mass of 19 kDa (HP19) from the hemolymph of a lepidopteran insect, the rice moth, Corcyra cephalonica. Western analysis of hemolymph proteins with denaturing and non-denaturing PAGE using antibodies raised against HP19 suggest that this protein exists as a monomer. It is synthesized by the hind gut-associated lobular fat body of the larvae and is released into the hemolymph. The stimulatory effect of HP19 on the ACP activity is developmentally regulated and exhibits its maximal effect shortly before the onset of metamorphosis. We cloned the HP19 cDNA by immunoscreening a hind gut-associated lobular fat body cDNA expression library. Analysis of the amino acid sequence shows that HP19 belongs to the family of glutathione S-transferase (GST) like proteins. However, affinity-purified GST from Corcyra failed to show any mediation effect on 20E-stimulated ACP activity, and HP19 lacks GST enzymatic activity. Notably, HP19 mediates the hormone-stimulated ACP activity in intact fat body tissue and homogenates even in the presence of inhibitors of transcription and translation, suggesting a nongenomic mode of action. In addition, we show that HP19 inhibits the 20E-induced phosphorylation of the hexamerin receptor protein.

Insect metamorphosis, the transition from the larval to the adult stage of insects, is controlled by ecdysteroid hormones (1Trumann J.W. Riddiford L.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 467-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 2Riddiford L.M. Cherbas P. Truman J.W. Vitam. Horm. 2001; 60: 1-73Crossref Google Scholar, 3Gilbert L.I. Rybczynski R. Warren J.T. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 883-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The ecdysteroids, like the steroids in vertebrates, regulate gene transcription by binding to the nuclear receptors, which are ligand-activated transcription factors that convert the hormonal stimulus into a transcription response (4White R.

Riddiford L.M. Annu. Rev. Entomol. 2002; 47: 467-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). As a part of cell remodeling during metamorphosis, acidic autophagic vacuoles accumulate in the cells of the fat body, and the activity of several lysosomal enzymes such as acid phosphatases increase and cause the lysis of larval tissues (8Thummel C.S. BioEssays. 2001; 23: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Lee C.Y. Baehriecke E.H. Development. 2001; 128: 1443-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 10Sass M. Kovacs J. J.

The fat body fills a large fraction of the insect, and its function has been considered equivalent to the role of the vertebrate liver in the intermediary metabolism (12Hansen I.A. Meyer S.R. Schafer I. Scheller K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 954-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the stimulation of the lysosomal activity is governed by ecdysteroids (11Verkuil E.V.P. J.

There is an indication that in this case the hormone possibly acts on a nongenomic level (17Verkuil E.V.P. J. Insect Physiol. 1979; 25: 965-973Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although the molecular mechanism of the genomic mode of steroid action is well known, the mechanism of nongenomic steroid action remains unclear to date (18Losel R. Wehling M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 4: 46-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Earlier studies show that 20E 1The abbreviations used are: 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; ACP, acid phosphatase; HP19, 19-kDa hemolymph protein; CcHP19, C. cephalonica HP19; CfGST, C. fumiferana GST; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HGLFB, hind gut-associated lobular fat body; ELI, early last instar larvae; MLI, mid-last instar larvae; LLI, late-last instar larvae. 1The abbreviations used are: 20E, 20-hydroxyecdysone; ACP, acid phosphatase; HP19, 19-kDa hemolymph protein; CcHP19, C. cephalonica HP19; CfGST, C. fumiferana GST; GST, glutathione S-transferase; HGLFB, hind gut-associated lobular fat body; ELI, early last instar larvae; MLI, mid-last instar larvae; LLI, late-last instar larvae. stimulates ACP activity in fat bodies in vivo but not in vitro (19Caglayan S.H. Biochem. Int. 1990; 20: 511-518Google Scholar, 20Ashok M. Dutta-Gupta A. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 20: 159-165Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). This result suggests that 20E, the active form of ecdysone, requires an additional factor (or factors) to enhance ACP activity. Hence, we have focused on the process of acid phosphatase activation by 20E in the fat body cells of our model insect, the rice moth Corcyra cephalonica. We report the appearance of a stage and tissue-specific-regulated protein, HP19, in the hemolymph of Corcyra responsible for the activation of the 20E-dependent stimulation of ACP activity. This hormone-triggered activation is independent of gene transcription. Insects—Larvae of the rice moth, C. cephalonica (Stainton), were reared on coarsely crushed sorghum seeds at 26 ± 1 °C, 60 ± 5% relative humidity, and a 14:10-h light:dark photo period. In the present study, the last (=Vth) instar larvae, classified into early (ELI), mid (MLI), late-last instar (LLI) larvae and prepupae on the basis of body weight and head capsule size were used (21Lakshmi M. Dutta-Gupta A. Biochem. Int. 1990; 22: 269-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The larvae were thorax-ligated behind the first pair of prolegs by slipping a loop of silk thread around the head of the larvae as described earlier (20Ashok M. Dutta-Gupta A. Invert. Reprod. Dev. 1991; 20: 159-165Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The fat body and other insect tissue homogenates from ligated or unligated larvae were prepared as published earlier (22Arif A. Scheller K. Dutta-Gupta A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) and used after protein estimation in an aliquot of the homogenate (23Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211941) Google Scholar). ACP Assay—The enzyme assay was carried out according to the method of Henrickson and Clever (24Henrickson P.A. Clever U. J. Insect Physiol. 1972; 18: 1981-2004Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 150 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and 20 μg of tissue homogenate proteins. It was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min to exclude glucose-6-phosphatase activity (25Beaufay H. Bertlet J. de Durve C. Bull. Ste. Chim. Biol. 1954; 36: 1539-1550PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μmol of substrate, p-nitrophenyl bisodium phosphate (Sigma) to the assay mixture followed by incubation for 1 h at 37°C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 0.1 n NaOH, and the color was measured at 420 nm against a substrate blank. The p-nitrophenol was used for the preparation of a standard curve. The activity of the enzyme was expressed as nmol of p-nitrophenol released/h/μg of fat body protein. Hemolymph Sample—Hemolymph from LLI larvae was collected into tubes pretreated with 0.025% phenylthiourea, diluted (1:20) with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and spun for 3 min at 1000 × g to remove hemocytes. These hemolymph samples were used immediately after preparation. Studies on Fat Body Cultures—Ribbon-shaped visceral fat bodies from LLI larvae were dissected 24 h after ligation under sterile conditions in cold insect Ringer's solution and transferred to 100 μl of TC-100 insect culture medium (JRH Biosciences Inc.) with traces of streptomycin sulfate. After rinsing, the tissue was transferred to 200 μl of fresh culture medium, and 80 nm 20E was added while an equal volume of carrier solvent (ethanol) was added to the control cultures. The hormone 20E (Sigma) was dissolved in ethanol, the final concentration of which never exceeded 0.05% in any of the experiments. To study the hemolymph effect, the diluted (1:20) or fractionated hemolymph was added to the fat body culture in the presence or absence of 80 nm 20E. Studies with glutathione S-transferase (GST) were carried out by adding purified cytosolic GST from Corcyra to the fat body cultures in the presence of hormone. These cultures were then incubated for 4 h at 25 °C with gentle shaking. At the end of incubation the tissue was removed, rinsed in ice-cold insect Ringer, homogenized, and used for ACP assay. Fractionation and Purification of Hemolymph Proteins—Total hemolymph protein was loaded on a pre-equilibrated (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)) Sephadex G-50 column and eluted with the equilibration buffer. The single fractions were checked for their ability to enhance the ACP activity in LLI fat bodies kept in culture. The apparent molecular mass of the active fraction was determined by gel electrophoresis. The purification of the active fraction was carried out by fractionating the hemolymph proteins followed by gel filtration chromatography. For fractionation we used molecular weight cut-off fractionators (Amicon Inc.). The hemolymph sample preparation (1 mg of protein/ml) was first transferred into 30-kDa cut-off fractionators (YM-30) and centrifuged at 4000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to strip the protein fractions with mass above 100 kDa. The resultant filtrate as well as the retentate was collected separately. The filtrate with molecules <100 kDa was again subjected to fractionation using a 10-kDa cut-off fractionator (YM-10) for obtaining fraction of <30 kDa proteins. Once again, both filtrate and retentate were collected. Three fractions, having masses above 100 30–100 and below 30 kDa thus obtained, were used to test their effect on 20E-dependent ACP activity as described above. For the purification of the active fraction, hemolymph from ∼500 LLI larvae was fractionated using the 30-kDa cut-off fractionator. The filtrate was loaded on a Sephadex G-50 column pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4). The protein fractions were eluted with the same buffer. An aliquot of each fraction was added to the fat body kept in culture in the presence of 20E (80 nm), and its enhancing effect on ACP activity was analyzed. Peak fractions that stimulated ACP activity were pooled, and the purity was checked by SDS-PAGE. Production of Polyclonal Antibodies against HP19 —The HP19 protein band was electroeluted using a model 422 electroeluter (Bio-Rad) after slicing the protein band resolved by 12% SDS-PAGE and used as an antigen for raising polyclonal antibodies in 3-month-old male rabbits (New Zealand variety). The IgG fraction was purified by protein A-agarose chromatography (Bio-Rad). Electrophoresis and Western Blotting—SDS-PAGE was carried out using 2.1% stacking and 12% resolving gel (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205522) Google Scholar). Non-denaturing PAGE was carried out as described by Burmester et al. (27Burmester T. Antoniewski C. Lepesant J.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The resolved proteins were visualized by silver staining (28Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, the electrophoretically separated hemolymph proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (29Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44643) Google Scholar) and probed with polyclonal HP19 antibody to detect a polypeptide with the capability of mediating the ACP activity in the hemolymph as well as in different tissues. Visualization of the specific cross-reactivity was carried with anti-rabbit IgG coupled with alkaline phosphatase followed by nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reaction. Preparation of a Hind Gut-associated Lobular Fat Body (HGLFB) cDNA Expression Library and Immunoscreening—The cDNA from the RNA of HGLFBs was generated and amplified using the SMART III™ kit (Clontech). Total RNA was isolated using the TriFast kit (peqLab). The library was cloned in a pTriplEx2 vector and screened with the IgG fraction of anti-HP19 antibody (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). By immunoscreening of 6 × 109 recombinant phage plaques, 10 positives were obtained after 3 rounds, in vivo excised, converted into plasmids, and used for XL-1Blue cell transformation (Stratagene, La Jolla, USA). The restriction analysis revealed six of these clones to be of identical size. Sequencing of HP19 Clone—The inserts were sequenced on a PerkinElmer 310 sequencer using forward and reverse primers provided with the kit. About 60% of the positives were found to be GST-like sequences (BLAST search). One such clone was analyzed in detail. A multiple sequence alignment of deduced amino acid sequence with best matching invertebrate GSTs was carried out using ClustalW and GeneDoc 2.6. Southern and Northern Blotting—The genomic DNA from total larval body was isolated as described in Birren et al. (31Birren B. Green E.D. Klapholz S. Myers R.M. Roskams J. Genome Analysis: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 6-15Google Scholar) and was digested with EcoRI and HinfI. The digested DNA was resolved on 0.8% agarose gel. The total RNA isolated from different insect tissue was resolved on 1.2% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The HP19 cDNA insert corresponding to whole open reading frame was excised from the pTriplEx2 vector by EcoRI and NotI digestion, gel-purified, and random prime-labeled (MBI Fermentas) using [α-32P]dATP (∼3000 Ci/mmol, Board of Radiation and Isotope Technology (BRIT), Hyderabad, India) to a specific activity of >109 dpm/μg. The blots were worked up following standard procedures (30Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). GST Assay—The GST activity was measured by the method of Habig et al. (32Habig W.H. Pabst M.J. Jakoby W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 7130-7139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A 1-ml reaction mixture contained 10 μl of 100 mm 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene, 10 μlof100 mm reduced glutathione (GSH), and 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5). The reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme source and the product, i.e. the formation of thioether conjugate, was measured at 340 nm on a time scan of 0–60 s. Immunohistochemical Studies—The insect tissues were fixed in Carnoy's fixative (ethanol:chloroform:acetic acid, 6:3:1) for 4 h at room temperature and paraffin-embedded. Sections (5 μm) were cut and mounted on glass slides. For immunohistochemical staining the sections were deparaffinized and treated with blocking solution (2% bovine serum albumin and 1% preimmune goat serum in 50 mm Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Triton X-100) for 1 h at 4 °C. This was followed by anti-HP19 IgG treatment for 24 h at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The slides were then treated with anti-rabbit IgG coupled with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h. Washing after each step was done with three changes of Tris-buffered saline. These slides were finally processed for staining using nitro blue tetrazolium chloride/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate color reaction and mounted in glycerol gel (50% glycerol, 7.5% gelatin, and 0.1% azide in 0.1 m Tris-buffered saline) (33Meltzer J.C. Grimm P.C. Greenberg A.H. Nance D.M. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 599-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 34Webster S.G. Biol. Bull. 1998; 195: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The specificity of the antibodies was checked for all immunochemical experiments by treating parallel tissue sections using pre-immune rabbit serum. [35S]Methionine Incorporation Studies—In vitro incorporation of [35S]methionine in the fat bodies kept in culture was carried out to compare the changes in the level of total protein synthesis and ACP activity stimulation in the presence of 20E and HP19. The fat bodies kept in culture were first preincubated for 2 h with 10 μCi of [35S]methionine (∼1000 Ci/m mol, BRIT) at 25 °C followed by incubations either with 20E (80 nm) alone, HP19 (40 ng) alone, or both along with actinomycin D (1 mm) or cycloheximide (1 mm) for 2 or 4 h. After incubation, the fat bodies were removed and homogenized as described above. Equal amounts of protein were used for radiolabel quantitation after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. In Vitro Phosphorylation of Fat Body Proteins—Fat body homogenate from LLI larvae was incubated with 80 nm 20E and 40 ng of HP19 for 30 s, and phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 4 μCi of [λ-32P] ATP (∼3000 Ci/m mol, BRIT) as described earlier (22Arif A. Scheller K. Dutta-Gupta A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The labeled proteins were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. The gel was vacuum-dried and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at –70 °C for autoradiography. Statistical Analysis—The mean and S.D. were calculated for the variables studied. The data were statistically analyzed by one way analysis of variance followed by comparisons of means by Tukey multiple comparison tests using Sigma Stat software (Jandel Corp.). The values were considered significantly different from each other when p < 0.05. Identification of a Protein in the Hemolymph of Corcyra That Mediates the 20E-stimulated ACP Activity in the Fat Bodies of Thorax-ligated, Hormone-deprived Larvae—When insect larvae are ligated behind the first pair of prolegs, i.e. behind the hormone producing glands, the posterior part of the animal is known to be relatively free of endogenous ecdysteroids (35Priester D.W. Verkuil E.V.P. de Leeuw G. Cell Tissue Res. 1979; 200: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 36Dutta-Gupta A. Ashok M. Entomon. 1998; 23: 245-250Google Scholar, 37Burmester T. Scheller K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 695-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 1, a and b, shows the effect of thorax ligation and injection of exogenous 20E on the fat body ACP activity in LLI larvae. The ACP activity declined gradually from 6 to 72 h after ligation. Because the ACP activity in the fat body was significantly lower after 24 h of ligation, this time period was used for all hormone manipulation studies. Hormone injections of 80 nm 20E, i.e. the physiological concentration (22Arif A. Scheller K. Dutta-Gupta A. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2003; 33: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 36Dutta-Gupta A. Ashok M. Entomon. 1998; 23: 245-250Google Scholar), to 24 h post-ligated LLI larvae caused a significant increase in the ACP activity in fat bodies after 24 h compared with the solvent-treated larvae (Fig. 1b). To study the effect of hormone on the ACP activity of fat bodies kept in culture, the tissue was dissected from 24-h post-ligated larvae and cultured for 4 h in the presence of 80 nm 20E. The results show that 20E did not elicit any stimulatory effect, and the activity was more or less the same as in the controls (Fig. 1c). However, the addition of hemolymph from LLI larvae together with 20E caused a significant increase in the ACP activity (Fig. 1c). This observation suggests that the hemolymph contains a factor (or factors) required by 20E to stimulate the ACP activity in fat body cultures. When the hemolymph was treated with alcohol, heat, acid, alkali, or protease, no stimulation of the ACP activity by 20E could be observed, suggesting the proteinaceous nature of the factor (Fig. 1d). Purification and Characterization of the Hemolymph Factor as a Protein Mediating 20E-stimulated ACP Activity—After loading total hemolymph protein on a Sephadex G-50 column, we eluted several fractions (Fig. 2) and checked their ability to mediate the 20E-stimulated ACP activity. We found an active protein fraction with a molecular mass of ∼22 kDa, calculated from the elution profile (Fig. 2, inset), or 19 kDa, calculated from the mobility on a SDS-PAGE (Fig 3b). On the basis of these results we purified the active hemolymph protein first by fractionating the total hemolymph protein followed by gel filtration chromatography. The fractionation was carried out using 30- and 10-kDa cut-off filters. The filtrate from the 10-kDa cut-off filter gave a protein fraction that mediated the 20E-stimulated ACP activity of fat body cultures by an increase from 0.7 to 1.2 nmol of p-nitrophenol release/h/μg of protein (Fig. 3a). However, the protein yield in the filtrate obtained from the 10-kDa cut-off filter was insufficient to proceed for further purification. Therefore, the filtrate from the 30-kDa cut-off filters, in which the HP19 was contained, was used for gel filtration. The protein fraction eluted from the Sephadex column that mediated the 20E-dependent ACP activity resulted in a contaminant-free pure polypeptide band of 19 kDa (Fig. 3b). Hence, the active hemolymph protein was named as HP19. Starting with 50 mg of total hemolymph protein, we obtained a 98.5-fold purification with 0.05% yield.Fig. 3Purification of a hemolymph protein enhancing the 20E-stimulated ACP activity in Corcyra fat body cultures.a, effect of different hemolymph fractions obtained using a 30- and 10-kDa fractionator on the ACP activity in fat body tissue culture in the presence of 20E.

Horm. 2001; 60: 1-73Crossref Google Scholar) and probed with CcHP19 cDNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Western blots presented in Fig. 3c show the specificity of the HP19 antibody both on denatured (lane 1) and non-denatured (lane 2) PAGE. A single protein band of 19 kDa suggested a monomeric structure of HP19. Southern analysis of genomic DNA (Fig. 3d) digested with EcoRI or HinfI probed with HP19-cDNA revealed HP19 as a single copy gene. cDNA Cloning and Sequence Analysis of HP19 —To identify the cDNA encoding the HP19 protein, a cDNA expression library, prepared from the RNA of HGLFB of LLI larvae, was immunoscreened. We picked 10 positive cDNA clones for detailed examination. The restriction analysis revealed 6 of the 10 clones to be of identical size. Initial sequencing study demonstrated significant sequence similarity among these clones. Furthermore, they showed homology with invertebrate GSTs. One of our clones was sub-cloned and totally sequenced (GenBank™ accession number AY369240). This HP19 cDNA was 634 nucleotides long, with an open reading frame of 585 bp, which encodes a protein of 195 amino acids. The calculated molecular mass of the translated unmodified protein was 22.95 kDa, which is close to the mass of HP19 detected in HGLFB, the tissue that synthesizes the protein (see Fig. 6e). The polypeptide comprises 12.3% basic (9 Arg, 1 His, and 14 Lys) and 13.3% acidic residues (10 Asp and 16 Glu) but no Cys residue. The estimated isoelectric point (pI) is 5.36. Comparison of the C. cephalonica HP19 (CcHP19) cDNA with the sequences in the GenBank™ showed 67% identity with Choristoneura fumiferana GST (CfGST) (38Feng Q.L. Davey G.K. Pang A.S.D. Primavera M. Ladd T.R. Zheng S.C. Sohi S.S. Retankaran A. Palli S.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 29: 779-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Similarities of HP19 cDNA with other invertebrate GST were found to be less than 38%. The comparison of the amino acid sequences of CcHP19 with the four best matching invertebrate GSTs is shown in Fig. 4. Although the CcHP19 cDNA sequence revealed 67% identity with CfGST, affinity-purified GST from Corcyra had no enhancing effect on the 20E-dependent ACP activity when compared with purified HP19 or recombinant HP19 (Fig 5a). Furthermore, the hemolymph as well as the purified HP19 had negligible GST activity (Fig. 5b).Fig. 4Alignment of the deduced amino acid sequence of C. cephalonica HP19 (CcHP19) with GST sequences of other insects (BLAST search).CfGST, C. fumiferana (AF128867); BgGST, Blattella germanica (U92412); MsGST, Manduca sexta (L32092); MdGST, Musca domestica (U02616).

A stimulation of the ACP activity by 20E was only observed when it was co-cultured with HGLFB (Fig. 6a). The hemolymph used in all experiments was cell-free and, therefore, cannot be the site of HP19 synthesis. The tissue specificity of HP19 biosynthesis was further confirmed by immunohistochemical staining of different tissue sections using HP19 antibody. Again,"
