https://openalex.org/W2079356804,"Neurogenesis in the mammalian central nervous system is believed to end in the period just after birth; in the mouse striatum no new neurons are produced after the first few days after birth. In this study, cells isolated from the striatum of the adult mouse brain were induced to proliferate in vitro by epidermal growth factor. The proliferating cells initially expressed nestin, an intermediate filament found in neuroepithelial stem cells, and subsequently developed the morphology and antigenic properties of neurons and astrocytes. Newly generated cells with neuronal morphology were immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid and substance P, two neurotransmitters of the adult striatum in vivo. Thus, cells of the adult mouse striatum have the capacity to divide and differentiate into neurons and astrocytes."

https://openalex.org/W2074854285,"Every eye movement produces a shift in the visual image on the retina. The receptive field, or retinal response area, of an individual visual neuron moves with the eyes so that after an eye movement it covers a new portion of visual space. For some parietal neurons, the location of the receptive field is shown to shift transiently before an eye movement. In addition, nearly all parietal neurons respond when an eye movement brings the site of a previously flashed stimulus into the receptive field. Parietal cortex both anticipates the retinal consequences of eye movements and updates the retinal coordinates of remembered stimuli to generate a continuously accurate representation of visual space."

This allows optical monitoring of vesicle recycling in living nerve terminals to determine how recycled vesicles reenter the vesicle pool. The results suggest that recycled vesicles mix with the pool morphologically and functionally. One complete cycle of release of transmitter, recycling of a vesicle, and rerelease of transmitter appears to take about 1 minute."
https://openalex.org/W2009518885,"The high sensitivity of voltage-gated ion channels to changes in membrane potential implies that the process of channel opening is accompanied by large charge movements. Previous estimates of the total charge displacement, q, have been deduced from the voltage dependence of channel activation and have ranged from 4 to 8 elementary charges (e0). A more direct measurement of q in Drosophila melanogaster Shaker 29-4 potassium channels yields a q value of 12.3 e0. A similar q value is obtained from mutated Shaker channels having reduced voltage sensitivity. These results can be explained by a model for channel activation in which the equilibria of voltage-dependent steps are altered in the mutant channels."

https://openalex.org/W2037539600,"Matrix attachment regions (MARs) are thought to separate chromatin into topologically constrained loop domains. A MAR located 5' of the human beta-interferon gene becomes stably base-unpaired under superhelical strain, as do the MARs flanking the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancer; in both cases a nucleation site exists for DNA unwinding. Concatemerized oligonucleotides containing the unwinding nucleation site exhibited a strong affinity for the nuclear scaffold and augmented SV40 promoter activity in stable transformants. Mutated concatemerized oligonucleotides resisted unwinding, showed weak affinity for the nuclear scaffold, and did not enhance promoter activity. These results suggest that the DNA feature capable of relieving superhelical strain is important for MAR functions."

https://openalex.org/W1516006437,"We found that a preparation of the 90-kDa heat shock protein, HSP90, purified to apparent homogeneity, contains a serine/threonine kinase which phosphorylates HSP90. The protein kinase was identified as casein kinase II (CKII) according to its properties. The protein kinase was separable from HSP90 by adsorption to heparin-Sepharose or phosphocellulose. CKII was coimmunoprecipitated with HSP90 by anti-HSP90 antibodies from cell extracts. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis revealed that an addition of anti-HSP90 antibodies to cell extracts induces a shift of the sedimentation peak of CKII toward the bottom of a centrifuge tube. These results suggest that CKII is associated with HSP90 in cell lysates at low salt conditions. Furthermore, the CKII.HSP90 complex was reconstituted from purified HSP90-free CKII and CKII-free HSP90. In a buffer at low ionic strength, CKII forms large aggregates, but HSP90 dissociates the aggregates. Finally, we found that HSP90 activates CKII; an addition of HSP90 to CKII dramatically increased phosphorylation of exogenous substrates as well as the CKII beta subunit. Taken altogether, these observations suggest that CKII is structurally and functionally active when it forms a complex with HSP90."
https://openalex.org/W2047204461,"Cell surface receptors for echovirus, a common human pathogen, were identified with monoclonal antibodies that protected susceptible cells from infection with echovirus 1. These monoclonal antibodies, which prevented virus attachment to specific receptor sites, recognized the alpha and beta subunits of the integrin VLA-2 (alpha 2 beta 1), a receptor for collagen and laminin. RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells expressed little VLA-2, did not bind to 35S-labeled virus, and resisted infection until transfected with complementary DNA encoding the alpha 2 subunit of VLA-2. Thus, integrins, adhesion receptors important in interactions between cells and with the extracellular matrix, can mediate virus attachment and infection."

https://openalex.org/W2023490184,"The interaction between the low molecular weight G protein ras p21 and a guanosine triphosphatase activating protein (GAP) uncouples a heterotrimeric G protein (Gk) from muscarinic receptors. Through the use of isolated atrial cell membranes and genetically engineered GAP deletion mutants, the src homology regions (SH2-SH3) at the amino terminus of GAP have been identified as the domains responsible for this effect. Deletion of the domain required to stimulate the guanosine triphosphatase activity of ras p21 relieves the requirement for ras p21 in this system. A model is presented that suggests that ras p21 induces a conformational change in GAP, which allows the SH2-SH3 regions of GAP to function."
https://openalex.org/W2090827268,"Many specific DNA-binding proteins bind to sites with dyad symmetry, and the bound form of the protein is a dimer. For some proteins, dimers form in solution and bind to DNA. LexA repressor of Escherichia coli has been used to test an alternative binding model in which two monomers bind sequentially. This model predicts that a repressor monomer should bind with high specificity to an isolated operator half-site. Monomer binding to a half-site was observed. A second monomer bound to an intact operator far more tightly than the first monomer; this cooperativity arose from protein-protein contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1562872488,"We have identified an alternatively spliced form of the human beta 1 integrin subunit, beta 1S. The beta 1S mRNA is expressed in human platelets, HEL and K562 erythroleukemia cell lines, and THP1 monocytic and HL60 promyelocytic cell lines. It is undetectable in peripheral blood lymphocytes and cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells at early passages. The beta 1S cDNA encodes a new cytoplasmic domain distinct from the previously reported alternative cytoplasmic domain of the beta 1 subunit. The sequence reveals the presence of an insert of 116 nucleotides which produces a frame shift in the previously reported 3' end of the beta 1 integrin subunit and codes for a unique 48-amino acid COOH-terminal sequence. An antiserum prepared against a synthetic peptide generated from the deduced sequence of the beta 1S cytoplasmic domain immunoprecipitated an HEL cell surface molecule that comigrated with the usual beta 1 subunit in sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis. The immunoprecipitation indicated that beta 1S constitutes a minor portion of total beta 1 subunit in these cells. This variant beta 1 cytoplasmic tail may modulate integrin affinity and may provide additional modes for the transduction of extracellular signals and modulation of cytoskeletal organization by beta 1 integrins."
https://openalex.org/W1999190965,"Most neurons have inhibitory synapses both ""proximally"" near the spike-initiating zone and ""distally"" on dendrites. Although distal inhibition is thought to be an adaptation for selective inhibition of particular dendritic branches, another important distinction exists between proximal and distal inhibition. Proximal inhibition can attenuate excitatory input absolutely so that no amount of excitation causes firing. Distal inhibition, however, inhibits relatively; any amount of it can be overcome by sufficient excitation. These properties are used as predicted in the circuit-mediating crayfish escape behavior. Many neuronal computations require relative inhibition. This could partly account for the ubiquity of distal inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1547371126,"The human and simian immunodeficiency virus envelope glycoproteins, which mediate virus-induced cell fusion, contain two putative amphipathic helical segments with large helical hydrophobic moments near their carboxyl-terminal ends. In an attempt to elucidate the biological role of these amphipathic helical segments, we have synthesized peptides corresponding to residues 768-788 and 826-854 of HIV-1/WMJ-22 gp160. Circular dichroism studies of the peptides showed that the alpha helicity of the peptides increased with the addition of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) indicating that the peptides form lipid-associating amphipathic helixes. The peptides solubilized turbid suspensions of DMPC vesicles, and electron microscopy of peptide-DMPC mixtures revealed the formation of discoidal complexes, suggesting that the peptides bind to and perturb lipid bilayers. The peptides were found to lyse lipid vesicles and caused carboxyfluorescein leakage from dye-entrapped egg phosphatidylcholine liposomes. The peptides also lysed human erythrocytes and were found to be toxic to cell cultures. At subtoxic concentrations, the peptides effectively inhibited the fusion of CD4+ cells infected with recombinant vaccinia virus expressing human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 envelope proteins. Based on these results, and reported studies on the mutational analysis of HIV envelope proteins, we suggest that the amphipathic helical segments near the carboxyl terminus of HIV envelope proteins may play a role in lysis of HIV-infected cells and also may modulate the extent of cell fusion observed during HIV infection of CD4+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W1524418166,"In this study, by using highly purified rat liver peroxisomes, we provide evidence from analytical cell fractionation, Western blot, and immunocytochemical analysis that Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase is present in animal peroxisomes. Treatment with ciprofibrate, a peroxisome proliferator, increased the peroxisomal superoxide dismutase activity by 3-fold with no effect on mitochondrial activity but a marked decrease in cytosolic superoxide dismutase activity, further supporting that besides cytosolic and mitochondrial localization, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase is present in peroxisomes also. Demonstration of superoxide dismutase in peroxisomes suggests a new role for this organelle in pathophysiological conditions, such as ischemia-reperfusion injury."
https://openalex.org/W1529121555,"RNA splicing defects in mitochondrial intron mutants can be suppressed by a high dosage of several proteins encoded by nuclear genes. In this study we report on the isolation, nucleotide sequence, and possible functions of the nuclear MRS2 gene. When present on high copy number plasmids, the MRS2 gene acts as a suppressor of various mitochondrial intron mutations, suggesting that the MRS2 protein functions as a splicing factor. This notion is supported by the observations that disruption of the single chromosomal copy of the MRS2 gene causes (i) a pet- phenotype and (ii) a block in mitochondrial RNA splicing of all four mitochondrial group II introns, some of which are efficiently self-splicing in vitro. In contrast, the five group I introns monitored here are excised from pre-mRNA in a MRS2-disrupted background although at reduced rates. So far the MRS2 gene product is unique in that it is essential for splicing of all four group II introns, but relatively unimportant for splicing of group I introns. In strains devoid of any mitochondrial introns the MRS2 gene disruption still causes a pet- phenotype and cytochrome deficiency, although the standard pattern of mitochondrial translation products is produced. Therefore, apart from RNA splicing, the absence of the MRS2 protein may disturb the assembly of mitochondrial membrane complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2036964953,"A single germ line gene mutation at a tumor susceptibility locus in a rodent model of hereditary human renal cancer caused a 70-fold increase in susceptibility to chemical carcinogenesis. A carcinogen that targeted both renal epithelial and mesenchymal cells caused an increase in tumors of epithelial origin in susceptible animals; the number of carcinogen-induced mesenchymal tumors was unaffected by the presence of the mutation at the susceptibility locus. Thus, this mutation defines a genetic locus for susceptibility to carcinogen-induced tumors and modulation of carcinogen susceptibility by this locus exhibits cell-type specificity."

Two activators of protein kinase C, 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-rac-glycerol and phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, inhibited the current. This inhibition was blocked by the kinase inhibitor staurosporine. Inhibition of the current was not seen in channels in which Ser103 was replaced by Ala, although other properties of the current were unchanged. These results indicate that inhibition of the potassium current results from direct phosphorylation of the channel subunit protein at Ser103."

During the 1960s cultural changes adversely affected children while their material condition improved substantially. By contrast, material conditions deteriorated in the 1980s, especially among children at the lower end of the income distribution. Public policies to improve the material condition of children require a transfer of resources from households that do not have children to those that do. Government programs such as tax credits and child allowances are more efficient and equitable than employer-mandated programs."
https://openalex.org/W1530797390,"On the basis of structural homology and similar biological activity, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) has been considered the mammalian equivalent of amphibian bombesin. In this paper we now show this to be incorrect. Chromatography of frog (Bombina orientalis) gut extracts demonstrated two peaks of bombesin-like immunoreactivity (BLI), one similar in size to GRP and one similar in size to amphibian bombesin. These peaks were purified by high pressure liquid chromatography then subjected to mass spectrometric analyses to determine molecular weights and amino acid sequence. Based on the amino acid sequence of the lower molecular weight BLI species, a mixed oligonucleotide probe was prepared and used to screen a B. orientalis stomach cDNA library. Sequence analysis showed that all hybridizing clones encoded a 155-amino acid protein homologous to the mammalian GRP precursor. The mass spectra of the high and low molecular weight peaks of frog gut BLI were consistent with their origin from the processing of the frog GRP (fGRP) precursor into GRP-29 and GRP-10, just like the processing of the rat GRP precursor. Sequence homology showed that the fGRP precursor is more homology showed that the fGRP precursor is more closely related to the mammalian GRP precursors than to either the frog bombesin or frog ranatensin precursors. Northern blot analysis showed that fGRP is encoded by a mRNA of 980 bases, clearly different from the 750-base mRNA which encodes frog bombesin. Northern blot analysis and in situ hybridization showed fGRP mRNA in frog brain and stomach and bombesin mRNA in frog skin, brain, and stomach. That frogs have independent genes for both GRP and bombesin raises the possibility that mammals have an as yet uncharacterized gene encoding a true mammalian bombesin."
https://openalex.org/W1607052124,"A protein that blocks collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation has been identified and isolated from the soluble fraction of salivary glands from Haementeria officinalis leeches. We have named this protein leech antiplatelet protein (LAPP). LAPP was isolated from soluble crude salivary gland extract by heparin-agarose, size exclusion, and C18 reverse phase high-performance chromatography. Its molecular weight is approximately 16,000 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reduced and nonreduced conditions. The sequences of peptides generated by V8 digestion of LAPP as well as its amino acid composition suggested no homology to other known proteins. The IC50 for LAPP to inhibit platelet aggregation was approximately 60 nM. This inhibitory activity is specific for collagen-induced aggregation. Platelet aggregation in response to ADP, arachidonic acid, U46619, thrombin, and ionophore A23187 was not inhibited by LAPP at a concentration that blocked platelet aggregation to collagen by 100%. In contrast, crude salivary gland-soluble extract contained activity(ies) which inhibited aggregation to all these agonists except thrombin at 1 unit/ml and 2 microM A23187. Thus, the H. officinalis leech has evolved multiple mechanisms to prevent hemostasis, including an inhibitor of collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation. The identification and isolation of LAPP demonstrates the existence of a new type of platelet inhibitor that should be useful to better understand the mechanism of collagen stimulation of platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1534485329,"We report here that brefeldin A (BFA), which specifically blocks protein transport from an endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus and causes resorption of Golgi membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum, specifically induced the endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein GRP78. Treatment of a human hepatoma cell line Alex-PC with BFA at a concentration of 5 micrograms/ml increased the grp78 transcript level by 12-fold. Analyses of the transcriptional rate of grp78 and the transfection with grp78 promoter suggested that this cell line utilized a posttranscriptional mechanism to increase the expression of grp78 in response to BFA. The induction process was partially dependent on de novo protein synthesis. Interestingly, in a hamster lung fibroblast cell line, K12, the induction of grp78 by BFA could be mediated by a transcriptional control mechanism. We further demonstrated that in K12 cells the region of the grp78 promoter responsive to BFA was within a 40-base pair region between -169 and -130, containing the conserved grp core and a 10-base pair region between -99 to -90 that contained a proximal CCAAT element. A model of how BFA regulates grp78 expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level is presented."
https://openalex.org/W1584870064,"Ribonucleotide reductase provides the four deoxyribonucleotides required for the synthesis of DNA. In this study, we examined the hypothesis that alterations in the regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity may be necessary to provide the deoxyribonucleotides required for DNA repair, following exposure of mammalian cells to DNA damaging agents such as the antitumor agent chlorambucil. We observed a marked transient increase in ribonucleotide reductase activity within 2 h of exposing BALB/c 3T3 mouse cells to DNA damaging concentrations of chlorambucil. Northern blot analysis showed that elevations in activity were accompanied by transient increases in the mRNA levels of both genes (R1 and R2) that code for ribonucleotide reductase. Western blot analysis indicated that only the protein for the limiting component for enzyme activity, R2, was significantly elevated in chlorambucil treated cultures. The chlorambucil effects upon activity and regulation of ribonucleotide reductase occurred without any detectable changes in the rate of DNA synthesis, as would be expected if the elevation in enzyme activity is required for DNA repair. The chlorambucil-induced elevations in R1 and R2 message levels were blocked by treatment of cells with actinomycin D or the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, indicating the importance of the reductase transcriptional process in responding to the action of chlorambucil and providing evidence for the involvement of a protein kinase C pathway in the regulation of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase. In addition to the chlorambucil-induced elevations in enzyme activity, message, and protein levels, the drug was also shown to be an inhibitor of ribonucleotide reductase activity in cell-free preparations. Separation of ribonucleotide components on an affinity column followed by selective exposure of the protein components to chlorambucil showed that both R1 and R2 proteins were targets for chlorambucil, in keeping with the known alkylating abilities of the drug. These observations provide the first direct demonstration of a link between the regulation of mammalian ribonucleotide reductase and the process of DNA repair and contribute to our understanding of the mode of action of a class of drugs represented by chlorambucil, in which chemotherapeutic activity has been attributed to DNA damaging effects."
https://openalex.org/W2033816749,"Time-correlated single-photon counting of intercalated ethidium bromide was used to measure the torsion constants of positively supercoiled, relaxed, and negatively supercoiled pBR322 DNA, which range in superhelix density from +0.042 to -0.123. DNA behaves as coupled, nonlinear torsional pendulums under superhelical stress, and the anharmonic term in the Hamiltonian is approximately 15 percent for root-mean-square fluctuations in twist at room temperature. At the level of secondary structure, positively supercoiled DNA is significantly more flexible than negatively supercoiled DNA. These results exclude certain models that account for differential binding affinity of proteins to positively and negatively supercoiled DNA."
https://openalex.org/W1559853198,"Genes encoding the C- and N-terminal regions of SecE were constructed and placed under the control of the tac promoter on plasmids. The C-terminal region of SecE (SecE-C) was sufficient for suppression of the secEcs phenotype, confirming the results of Schatz et al. (Schatz, P. J., Bieker, K. L., Ottemann, K. M., Silhavy, T. J., and Beckwith, J. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 1749-1757). SecE-C allowed the overproduction of SecY, and its overproduction was achieved when the tac-secY gene, on a plasmid, was induced, indicating that the C-terminal region is the site of interaction of SecE with SecY and that the interaction makes the two Sec proteins stable. SecE-C was purified and used with SecY for the reconstitution of protein translocation activity. SecE-C was active in the functional reconstitution. The SecE-C/SecY-dependent protein translocation absolutely required SecA and ATP as the native translocation reaction did. Quantitative analysis revealed that SecE-C was 50% as active as intact SecE. The N-terminal region of SecE (SecE-N) also suppressed in vivo the defect caused by the secEcs mutation. SecE-N was, however, inactive in the overproduction of SecY. A possible oligomeric structure of SecE is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1575416480,"Abstract The protein previously called Mr approximately 50/pI approximately 6.9, which we observed to be induced by the immunoregulatory cytokine interferon (IFN)-gamma in human fibroblasts, was purified from a total cell lysate by preparative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and identified by partial amino-terminal sequencing as leucine aminopeptidase (LAP), a 53-kDa cytosolic exopeptidase. Induction of LAP protein by IFN-gamma, confirmed by immunoblotting with an antiserum raised against bovine lens LAP, is a consequence of induction of LAP mRNA and occurs in all four human cell lines examined: HS153 fibroblasts, ACHN renal carcinoma, A549 lung carcinoma, and A375 melanoma. Induction of LAP mRNA is a secondary response to IFN-gamma, blocked by inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide."

https://openalex.org/W1498024304,"Twelve human C1 inhibitor P1 variants were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis of the codon for arginine 444 and were expressed in COS-1 cells to analyze the functional properties. The ability to bind to target proteases, as well as potential substrate-like behavior, was investigated with radioimmunoassays. The P1-Lys variant retained binding capacity toward C1s, plasmin, and kallikrein. In addition, complex formation with C1s was detected for P1-Asn and P1-His. All other P1 substitutions resulted in C1 inhibitor variants that neither complexed with nor were inactivated by C1s, kallikrein, beta-factor XIIa, or plasmin. Electrophoretic studies confirmed that P1-Lys and P1-His can form sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant complexes with C1s. In contrast, the C1s-P1-Asn complex dissociated upon addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate. Kinetic experiments by the method of progress curves generated association rate constants (kon) with C1s of 4.2 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for recombinant wild-type C1 inhibitor and 1.7 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 for P1-Lys. For P1-Asn and P1-His, kon was decreased approximately 100-fold. The results from inhibition experiments were compatible with a model of reversible inhibition, although the observed dissociation rate for wild-type C1 inhibitor is too low (1-2 x 10(-6) s-1) to be physiologically relevant. The overall inhibition constant (Ki) was estimated to be 0.03 nM. With P1-Asn, reversible inhibition could be demonstrated directly upon dilution of preformed complexes; the observed dissociation rate constant was 3.2 x 10(-4) s-1; and Ki increased to approximately 380 nM. These findings are discussed in relation to inhibitor specificity and inhibition mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1592241841,"The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) E, a major protein component of very low density lipoproteins, were examined in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 under metabolic conditions known to stimulate lipogenesis and the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins. When HepG2 cells were incubated in the presence of fetal bovine serum (5 or 10%) or canine chylomicron remnants (5 or 10 micrograms of protein), the secretion of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters of lipoproteins of d less than 1.063 g/ml increased, as determined by the incorporation of [14C]acetate. Determination of the distribution of apoE among media lipoproteins by agarose column chromatography showed that the majority of secreted apoE was associated with large lipoproteins when cells were incubated with fetal bovine serum. However, immunoblot analysis of total media apoE revealed that incubating cells with or without the lipogenic factors had no effect on the amount of apoE secreted. Pulse-chase and continuous labeling experiments demonstrated that the synthesis and secretion of apoE did not vary under the different metabolic conditions, even though there was a 5-fold increase in apoB secretion in response to increased lipogenesis. Neither apoE nor apoB mRNA levels responded to the lipogenic stimuli. We conclude that the synthesis and secretion of apoE are independent of the production of apoB-containing lipoproteins in HepG2 cells."
https://openalex.org/W1506494238,"Salivary glands of the leech Haementeria officinalis contain a protein, leech antiplatelet protein (LAPP), that specifically blocks collagen-mediated platelet aggregation (Connolly, T. M., Jacobs, J. W., and Condra, C. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6893-6898). Degenerate oligonucleotides whose sequences were derived from two short peptides from V8 digests of the native LAPP were used as primers to generate a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product which contains the cDNA region coding for the sequence between these two peptides. Using this PCR product as a hybridization probe, phage containing cDNA clones were isolated containing the entire deduced amino acid sequence for LAPP. Computer analysis of the amino acid sequence predicts a peptidase cleavage site between a 21-residue pre-peptide and a mature protein of 126 amino acids. A DNA insert to express the predicted mature LAPP protein was generated by PCR amplification using phage-derived cDNA clones as a substrate. This insert encoded a fusion protein with the leader sequence of the yeast alpha mating factor and the mature LAPP cDNA. These PCR products were cloned into the yeast expression vector pKH4 alpha 2. A KEX 2 Lys-Arg endopeptidase cleavage site was placed NH2-terminal to the predicted mature protein. This vector transfected into the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae directs expression of a secreted mature protein at levels up to 200 mg of LAPP/liter of culture medium. The recombinant protein was comparable to native LAPP in its electrophoretic mobility, its reactivity with anti-LAPP antisera, and its biological activity including inhibition of collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation and the adhesion of platelets to collagen. Availability of significant quantities of recombinant LAPP opens the way to further biochemical structure/function studies and to studies on the effects of an inhibitor of collagen-stimulated platelet aggregation in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1499065392,"Perturbation of the T cell antigen-specific receptor leads to a series of signaling events that includes a rapid increase in phosphoinositide hydrolysis, intracellular Ca2+, and tyrosine phosphorylation. We have examined the function of tyrosine phosphorylation in isolation by introducing the v-src tyrosine kinase into a T cell hybridoma. T cell receptor-mediated increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and, in particular the generation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, were comparable between v-src+ and v-src- cells. Unexpectedly, the v-src+ cells exhibited spontaneously elevated intracellular Ca2+ and exaggerated Ca2+ increases when stimulated via the T cell receptor. The enhanced Ca2+ response was not due to tyrosine phosphorylation of the T cell receptor itself, since the phenotype was evident in T cell receptor zeta chain-/v-src+ cells as well. These results demonstrate that an active protein tyrosine kinase can markedly affect intracellular Ca2+ handling by a process independent of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and T cell receptor tyrosine phosphorylation and raise the possibility that tyrosine kinases may directly regulate T cell receptor-mediated changes in intracellular Ca2+."

The rhaT gene was mapped on the E. coli chromosome between rhaR and sodA at 87.9 min, initially by Southern blot analysis and then by the isolation, expression, and sequencing of the rhaT gene. Both rhaT genes encoded a hydrophobic protein of 344 amino acids (91% identical) that contained 10 putative transmembrane regions.

https://openalex.org/W1519070256,"The late phase of the time-dependent epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced biphasic activation of the p70s6k is selectively attenuated by the specific PKC inhibitor, CGP 41,251, a staurosporine derivative. At a 40-fold lower concentration than CGP 41,251, staurosporine inhibits both phases of S6 kinase activation to the same extent, whereas the inactive staurosporine derivative CGP 42,700 shows no effect on either phase. Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and insulin also induce biphasic S6 kinase activation, but in neither case is either phase of activation affected by the presence of CGP 41,251. This finding was unexpected in the case of PDGF, which is a potent activator of PKC and whose receptor directly interacts with phospholipase C gamma 1. However, similar results were obtained following down-regulation of PKC by prolonged 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate treatment. Therefore, even though EGF and PDGF induce PKC activation, PDGF, unlike EGF, does not appear to use this signaling pathway for late phase p70s6k activation."
https://openalex.org/W1556769606,"We have investigated the structural and functional properties of two mutant insulin receptors in which Cys647 and Cys682,683,685 have been replaced with Ser (IRS647 and IRS682,683,685, respectively). Compared with the wild-type receptor (IRWT), both mutant receptors displayed altered sensitivities to dithiothreitol with respect to insulin binding and reduction of oligomeric forms. Subunit composition of the oligomeric forms of the receptors as determined by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-labeled receptors indicated that Cys682,683,685 are required for normal heterotetrameric structure and that Cys647 plays a major role in the normal covalent association of the alpha- and beta-subunits. Under nonreducing conditions, the affinity-labeled IRS647 migrated, almost exclusively, as a 230-kDa species which appeared to represent an alpha 2 form of the receptor. Furthermore, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing IRS647 did not exhibit basal or insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation, suggesting that Cys647 is also required for signal transduction."

The basis for this specificity presumably involves recognition of a short sequence within the extended binding pocket of the enzyme, other interactions remote from the catalytic groove, and modulation by a definite protein cofactor. In addition, Ca2+ plays a major role in most activation processes, but, because both the enzyme and its substrate interact with Ca2+, whether Ca2+ influences the substrate, the enzyme, or both remains an open question. Thrombin is not a factor X-activating enzyme, but when Glu192, 3 residues remote from the active Ser195, is replaced with glutamine, the resultant serine protease (E192Q) becomes a bovine, but not human, factor X activator. Kinetic experiments with peptides corresponding to human and bovine factor X activating sites reveal that threonine at position P2 in human (versus a valine in bovine) accounts for the species specificity. Substitution of the threonine in P2 of the human sequence with valine allows E192Q to cleave the human peptide whereas substitution of the valine in P2 of the bovine sequence with threonine hinders E192Q catalysis. Thrombin has no high affinity Ca2+ binding sites, and E192Q proteolysis of these peptides is not altered by Ca2+. The influence of Ca2+ in E192Q-mediated factor X activation provides therefore new insights into the role of the different Ca2+ binding sites in factor X. With factor X as substrate, the addition of Ca2+ enhances Kcat 4-fold but increases Km 10-fold. When the vitamin K-dependent gamma-carboxyglutamic acid domain of factor X is removed, the Km remains high with or without Ca2+ whereas Kcat still increases upon addition of the metal ion. These results suggest that factor X undergoes two metal-dependent suggest that factor X undergoes two metal-dependent transitions that influence the presentation of the activation site to activators."
https://openalex.org/W1559823782,"An RNA gel retardation assay was used to identify one or more cellular protein(s) (ornithine decarboxylase mRNA 5'-UTR binding protein (ODCBP)) that bind specifically to a conserved region of the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of rat ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNA. Ultraviolet light cross-linking demonstrated that this protein has an apparent Mr = 58,000 in mammalian cells. Treatment with the oxidizing agent diamide prevented binding of the ODCBP to ODC mRNA; addition of beta-mercaptoethanol reversed this inhibition and permitted mRNA.ODCBP complex formation. Cytoplasmic extracts from a variety of animal cells and tissues demonstrated similar binding activities; however, there was marked tissue-specific expression of the protein in the rat, with brain, heart, lung, and testis containing large amounts, and kidney, spleen, and skeletal muscle expressing negligible amounts. Binding was completely prevented by several mutations within a highly conserved heptanucleotide region (CCAU/ACUC) that was within 61 bases of the initiation codon in ODC mRNAs from mammals, Xenopus, and Caenorhabditis elegans; mutations 5' and 3' of the conserved heptanucleotide domain had no effect on binding activity. Binding was not affected by manipulation of cellular polyamine levels or by treatment of cells with agents that stimulate ODC biosynthesis. Thus, we have identified a widely distributed cellular protein that binds to a conserved domain within the 5'-UTR of ODC mRNA from many animal species; functional consequences of this binding remain to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W1496882207,"Numerous rodent cell lines exist that have defects in nucleotide excision repair of DNA caused by alterations in genes that fall into 10 different complementation groups. The precise roles in the repair of these genes are unknown. We report here that extracts from Chinese hamster ovary cells of excision repair-defective complementation groups 1 and 3 are defective in DNA excision repair in a cell-free system. In vitro complementation can be achieved by mixing extracts from the two groups with one another. In addition, extracts from a human cell line representing xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group B could complement rodent complementation group 1 extracts, but not group 3 extracts. This is consistent with an identity of the ERCC-3 and xeroderma pigmentosum group B genes. Cellular evidence points toward a defect in the incision of damaged DNA in group 1 and 3 mutants. Since the ERCC-1 and ERCC-3 proteins are required for the in vitro reaction, it appears that both gene products are directly involved in the enzymatic incision of damaged DNA, or in preincision reactions. The experiments reported here provide the biochemical basis of an approach to analyze the function of these nucleotide excision repair proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1514486811,"Abstract A galactosyltransferase that transfers galactose from UDP-galactose to glucosylceramide was purified 440-fold to apparent homogeneity from normal human kidney buffy coat preparation employing detergent extraction, ultrafiltration, and Sepharose Q column chromatography. On reducing and nonreducing gels, the enzyme resolved into two bands with apparent molecular weights on the order of 60,000 and 58,000, respectively. The activity of the enzyme was also associated with these two bands following separation on polyacrylamide gels. Analytical isoelectric focusing revealed that the pI of this enzyme is approximately 4.55. Product characterization and substrate specificity studies employing chromatography, enzymatic digestion with various glycosidases, and use of a variety of glycosphingolipid substrates revealed that the major product synthesized by this enzyme was Cer1-1 beta Glc4-1Gal, and Cer1-1 beta Glc was the preferred substrate. Digestion of the 60- and 58-kDa proteins with Staphylococcus aureus (V-8) protease revealed at least six peptides having identical electrophoretic migration. This finding suggests that the two proteins may be related to each other. Western immunoblot assays revealed that the antibody against UDP-galactose:GlcCer, beta 1-4 galactosyltransferase (GalT-2) but not galactosyltransferase UDP-Gal:N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-glycopeptide 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.38) (B-GT) immunoprecipitated (recognized) the kidney GalT-2. In contrast, antibody against B-GT did not immunoprecipitate GalT-2. Thus our data indicate that GalT-2 and B-GT are two distinct enzymes. The availability of the enzyme GalT-2 and corresponding antibody will allow functional studies in the near future."
https://openalex.org/W1520566566,"We have developed a clonal variant, named DF-40, from the N2a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, which has the ornithine decarboxylase (L-ornithine carboxylase, EC 4.1.1.17, ODC) gene amplified. When DF-40 cells were maintained in a simple salt glucose medium (e.g. Earle's blanced salt solution), L-asparagine alone was sufficient to induce a maximal increase in ODC activity. The increase in ODC activity correlated well with an increase in the amount of ODC protein. Northern blot analysis indicated that asparagine caused a 12-15-fold increase in ODC mRNA. The half-life of ODC mRNA induced by asparagine in DF-40 cells changed from more than 8 h to about 25 min upon removal of asparagine from the culture in the presence of actinomycin D. In contrast, asparagine had little or no effect on the rate of transcription of the ODC gene. Pulse labeling of cells for 15 min with [35S]methionine showed a 90-140-fold increase in the synthesis of ODC protein after 4-8 h of incubation with asparagine. The removal of asparagine from the medium resulted in a rapid loss of ODC protein with a half-life as short as 12 min. The presence of asparagine increased the half-life of ODC protein by 3-5-fold when measured in the presence of cycloheximide. Taken together, our data show that asparagine induced ODC gene expression in DF-40 cells, primarily by post-transcriptional stabilization of ODC mRNA. In addition, asparagine specifically stimulated the synthesis and suppressed the degradation of ODC protein."
https://openalex.org/W1599452036,"Peripheral blood monocytes are essential participants in processes that require pericellular plasminogen activation, a regulated proteolytic pathway that is greatly influenced by the relative concentrations of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (profibrinolytic) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 2 (PAI-2) (anti-fibrinolytic). Monocyte synthesis of these molecules is inducible by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) although PAI-2 production is regulated over a much wider concentration range than is urokinase-type PA. The PAI-2 response of LPS-stimulated monocytes was investigated and found to be biphasic, with a peak of mRNA at 4-6 h after stimulation, a decrement in mRNA levels at 8-10 h, and a secondary increase at 16 h. The primary (early phase) response was studied in detail wherein PAI-2 protein production was found to depend on the levels of PAI-2 mRNA. The profiles of steady-state PAI-2 mRNA levels and PAI-2 protein production were parallel with respect to LPS concentration, time of exposure to LPS, and persistence of the response. PAI-2 mRNA accumulation was inducible by cycloheximide but prevented by actinomycin D. The increase in steady-state PAI-2 mRNA was mediated both by an increase in gene transcription and by stabilization of the mRNA once formed. Therefore, the initial phase of PAI-2 production by LPS-stimulated monocytes is determined by the amount of PAI-2 mRNA in these cells; levels of PAI-2 mRNA are controlled by several mechanisms, allowing for rapid variations in production of this molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1487749656,"Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated to proteasome purified from human erythrocytes. Five of six proteasome-specific mAbs reacted with three subunits in the molecular mass range of 25-28 kDa, indicating a common epitope. The other mAb (AP5C10) exhibited a more restricted reactivity, recognizing a 32-kDa subunit of the proteasome purified in its latent state. However, when the proteasome is isolated in its active state, AP5C10 reacts with a 28-kDa subunit, evidence for processing of the proteasome subunits during purification. Purified proteasome preparations which exhibited partial latency have both AP5C10 reactive subunits. Although the 32-kDa subunit appears required for latency, loss of this component and generation of the 28-kDa component are not obligatory for activation. The 32- and 28-kDa subunits can each be further resolved into three components by isoelectric focusing. The apparent loss of 4 kDa during the conversion of the 32- to 28-kDa subunit is accompanied by a shift to a more basic pI for each polypeptide. Western blots of the early steps of proteasome purification reveal an AP5C10-reactive protein at 41 kDa. This protein was separated from proteasomes by sizing chromatography and may represent a pool of precursor subunits. Since the 32-kDa subunit appears necessary for latency, it is speculated to play a regulatory role in ATP-dependent proteolytic activity."
https://openalex.org/W1603126923,"Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are the etiologic agents responsible for genital warts and are contributing factors in the pathogenesis of human cervical cancer. The HPV E7 gene is transcriptionally active in these diseases and has been shown to transform mammalian cells in vitro. We have expressed and purified the HPV-16 E7 gene product in Escherichia coli. The isolated E7 protein contains zinc in a 1:1 molar ratio. X-ray absorption fine structure studies demonstrated that the zinc is coordinated by 4 sulfur ligands. We sequentially derivatized the E7 cysteines to differentiate between solvent-exposed, metal-bound, and disulfide-associated cysteines. Our results demonstrate that Cys24 and Cys68 are accessible to solvent, while cysteines in the two conserved Cys-X-X-Cys motifs are likely involved in binding zinc. We observed no evidence for the existence of disulfide bonds in recombinant E7 protein under the conditions tested."
https://openalex.org/W1608709169,"Abstract Estrogen treatment of Xenopus frogs causes four mRNAs to become highly abundant in the liver. Three of these mRNAs have been previously identified as coding for vitellogenin, ferritin, and serum retinol binding protein. We show here that the fourth abundant liver messenger RNA comprises about 1500 nucleotides and codes for a 45-kDa secreted protein, designated Ep45. A clone complementary to Ep45 mRNA was isolated, and its identity was confirmed by hybridization selection of mRNA that translated in vitro into the Ep45 precursor. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the nearly full length cDNA revealed a total length of 1454 base pairs consisting of: 36 nucleotides of the 5' noncoding region, 1308 base pairs encoding an open reading frame of 436 amino acids, and 110 nucleotides of the 3' untranslated region. Ep45 mRNA may originate from as many as four closely spaced transcription start sites, which are 15 to 21 bases upstream of the first nucleotide of the cDNA clone. The Xenopus laevis genome appears to contain a single Ep45 gene. The deduced amino acid sequence indicates that Ep45 has features typical of a secreted protein, including a signal peptide of 16 amino acids and three potential sites for N-linked glycosylation, and is related to the serine protease inhibitors, a large family of proteins with very diverse physiological functions. Ep45 mRNA was absent in the liver of normal male frogs and increased at least 100-fold in response to estradiol-17 beta. Thus, both Ep45 and vitellogenin mRNAs are switched from undetectable to very high levels, a pattern of expression not found for any other mRNAs in Xenopus liver."
https://openalex.org/W1481102494,"The pyridine nucleotide transhydrogenase (PNT) of Escherichia coli consists of two different subunits (alpha and beta) and assembles as a tetramer (alpha 2 beta 2) in the inner membrane. The pnt genes from E. coli have been cloned on a multicopy plasmid resulting in high level expression of the enzyme activity. We have studied the influence of the different segments of the polypeptide chains of the alpha and beta subunits on the assembly and function of the enzyme by constructing a series of deletion mutants for both of the subunits. Our results show that the assembly of the beta subunit is contingent upon the insertion of the alpha subunit into the membrane, while the alpha subunit can assemble independently of the beta subunit. All deletions constructed for the cytosolic portion of the alpha subunit gave no incorporation of the alpha subunit and, as a consequence, of the beta subunit, also. Of the four membrane-spanning regions of the alpha subunit, the last two were indispensable, while the deletion of the first two still allowed the association of alpha as well as of the beta subunit with the membrane. However, the enzyme was not functional. The two subunits were also loosely associated as mild detergent treatment released them from the membrane in contrast with the wild-type enzyme. Deletions within the beta subunit had little effect on the assembly of the alpha subunit, although less was incorporated. All deletions involving the cytosolic portion of the beta subunit resulted in loss of incorporation into the membrane. Of the eight membrane-spanning regions of the beta subunit, the deletion of regions 2-3, 2-4, 2-6, and 2-7 yielded significant association of both the subunits with the membrane. However, none of these mutants assembled a functional enzyme, and again the two subunits were loosely associated with the membrane. Based on the stringent requirement of the cytosolic portions of alpha and beta subunits for assembly, a model is proposed that suggests interactions between these two regions must occur prior to assembly."
https://openalex.org/W1569426241,"We have characterized a DNA-protein interaction within a sequence element distal from the site of transcription initiation within the mouse housekeeping gene (HPRT) promoter region. This interaction occurs within a 35-base pair regulatory element which confers cell type-specific gene transcription, designated as the HPRT cis-acting regulatory element (HCRE). Competition analysis by gel mobility shift electrophoresis indicates that this DNA-protein interaction is novel and not related to many transcription factors previously reported. Cell cycle synchronization experiments and gel mobility shift assays have demonstrated that within the HCRE a specific DNA-protein complex responds to G1 activation of the cell cycle. Experiments to purify specific DNA-binding proteins that interact with the HCRE has resulted in the purification of one sequence-specific DNA-binding protein of approximately 66 kDa. To determine the putative DNA-binding sequence, footprinting analysis has mapped the protection from DNase I hydrolysis which confers a core sequence of GTCTGGGT using both affinity purified protein and crude nuclear extract. This DNA motif represents a novel protein-binding sequence. Interestingly, data base searches have identified the same or homologous sequences of this DNA motif in additional genes, potentially related to cellular growth and proliferation. This consensus was most notable within a region 5' upstream of the ornithine decarboxylase gene. The unique cell type-specific regulation of the HPRT gene in the intestinal mucosa is not completely understood at this time but because of the relationship of ornithine decarboxylase expression to cell proliferation and more specifically, to mucosal cell renewal in the intestine, the function of DNA-protein interactions within the consensus sequence may prove analogous. This may account for the cell type-specific and cell-cycle responsive gene regulation previously demonstrated with HPRT. Identification of one sequence-specific DNA-binding protein within the HCRE suggest that this protein contributes to the trans-activation of specific genes during the immediate-early response of the cell cycle."
