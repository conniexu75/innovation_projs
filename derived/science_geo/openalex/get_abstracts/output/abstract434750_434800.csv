https://openalex.org/W2145846829,"Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are involved in tolerance to drought, cold and high salinity in many different organisms. In this report, a LEA protein producing full-length gene OsLEA3-2 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa) using the Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) method. OsLEA3-2 was found to be only expressed in the embryo and can be induced by abiotic stresses. The coding protein localizes to the nucleus and overexpression of OsLEA3-2 in yeast improved growth performance compared with control under salt- and osmotic-stress conditions. OsLEA3-2 was also inserted into pHB vector and overexpressed in Arabidopsis and rice. The transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings showed better growth on MS media supplemented with 150 mM mannitol or 100 mM NaCl as compared with wild type plants. The transgenic rice also showed significantly stronger growth performance than control under salinity or osmotic stress conditions and were able to recover after 20 days of drought stress. In vitro analysis showed that OsLEA3-2 was able to protect LDH from aggregation on freezing and inactivation on desiccation. These results indicated that OsLEA3-2 plays an important role in tolerance to abiotic stresses."
https://openalex.org/W2078029507,"The chemotherapeutic agent 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) is a potent inducer of type I IFNs and other cytokines. This ability is essential for its chemotherapeutic benefit in a mouse cancer model and suggests that it might also be useful as an antiviral agent. However, the mechanism underlying DMXAA-induced type I IFNs, including the host proteins involved, remains unclear. Recently, it was reported that the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) decreased DMXAA-induced TNF-α and IL-6, suggesting that oxidative stress may play a role. The goal of this study was to identify host proteins involved in DMXAA-dependent signaling and determine how antioxidants modulate this response. We found that expression of IFN-β in response to DMXAA in mouse macrophages requires the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum resident protein STING. Addition of the antioxidant diphenylene iodonium (DPI) diminished DMXAA-induced IFN-β, but this decrease was independent of both the NADPH oxidase, Nox2, and de novo generation of reactive oxygen species. Additionally, IFN-β up-regulation by DMXAA was inhibited by agents that target the mitochondrial electron transport chain and, conversely, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential correlated with diminished innate immune signaling in response to DMXAA. Up-regulation of Ifnb1 gene expression mediated by cyclic dinucleotides was also impaired by DPI, whereas up-regulation of Ifnb1 mRNA due to cytosolic double-stranded DNA was not. Although both stimuli signal through STING, cyclic dinucleotides interact directly with STING, suggesting that recognition of DMXAA by STING may also be mediated by direct interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2059270218,"Proline metabolism is linked to hyperprolinemia, schizophrenia, cutis laxa, and cancer. In the latter case, tumor cells tend to rely on proline biosynthesis rather than salvage. Proline is synthesized from either glutamate or ornithine; both are converted to pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), and then to proline via pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (PYCRs). Here, the role of three isozymic versions of PYCR was addressed in human melanoma cells by tracking the fate of 13C-labeled precursors. Based on these studies we conclude that PYCR1 and PYCR2, which are localized in the mitochondria, are primarily involved in conversion of glutamate to proline. PYCRL, localized in the cytosol, is exclusively linked to the conversion of ornithine to proline. This analysis provides the first clarification of the role of PYCRs to proline biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2129603261,"Rhodopsins are light-activated chromoproteins that mediate signaling processes via transducer proteins or promote active or passive ion transport as ion pumps or directly light-activated channels. Here, we provide spectroscopic characterization of a rhodopsin from the Chlamydomonas eyespot. It belongs to a recently discovered but so far uncharacterized family of histidine kinase rhodopsins (HKRs). These are modular proteins consisting of rhodopsin, a histidine kinase, a response regulator, and in some cases an effector domain such as an adenylyl or guanylyl cyclase, all encoded in a single protein as a two-component system. The recombinant rhodopsin fragment, Rh, of HKR1 is a UVA receptor (λmax = 380 nm) that is photoconverted by UV light into a stable blue light-absorbing meta state Rh-Bl (λmax = 490 nm). Rh-Bl is converted back to Rh-UV by blue light. Raman spectroscopy revealed that the Rh-UV chromophore is in an unusual 13-cis,15-anti configuration, which explains why the chromophore is deprotonated. The excited state lifetime of Rh-UV is exceptionally stable, probably caused by a relatively unpolar retinal binding pocket, converting into the photoproduct within about 100 ps, whereas the blue form reacts 100 times faster. We propose that the photochromic HKR1 plays a role in the adaptation of behavioral responses in the presence of UVA light.

We propose that the photochromic HKR1 plays a role in the adaptation of behavioral responses in the presence of UVA light. The main sensory photoreceptor of the animal kingdom is rhodopsin. The respective spectral sensitivity of rhodopsins may cover an extremely broad range of the sunlight spectrum, from 358 nm (near ultraviolet, UVA) to 630 nm (near infrared) (1Kleinschmidt J.

Photobiol. 1999; 70: 111-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rhodopsins with absorption at the red edge of the spectrum (XL-iodopsins) are found in flies, mollusks, fish, and in some birds. At this spectral range, thermal isomerization increases, producing significant background at high rhodopsin concentrations (3Luo D.G. Yue W.W. Ala-Laurila P. Yau K.W. Activation of visual pigments by light and heat.Science. 2011; 332: 1307-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). On the other end of the spectrum, the UVA-absorbing pigment is of limited use because UV-transparent lenses promote damage of the retina. Even so, UV-sensitive rhodopsins are widely distributed in flies, birds, and nocturnal rodents (4Kusnetzow A.K. Dukkipati A. Babu K.R. Ramos L. Knox B.E. Birge R.R.

Action and absorption spectra have been recorded for rhodopsins at both edges of the visible spectrum, but further spectroscopic studies based on the structure and dynamics of the photoreceptors are missing because of difficulties in purifying these proteins in sufficient amounts. In prokaryotes like archaea or eubacteria, rhodopsins serve as light-driven H+ or Cl− pumps or mediate signal transduction via a two-component signaling system (6Gao R. Stock A.M. Biological insights from structures of two-component proteins.Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 63: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Another branch that is rich in rhodopsin-related proteins is freshwater algae. Phototaxis of motile species like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is mainly mediated by the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin, which is currently widely used in the new field of optogenetics to activate individual cells or cell types in brain slices or live animals to understand neuronal networks (7Zhang F. Vierock J. Yizhar O. Fenno L.E. Tsunoda S. Kianianmomeni A. Prigge M. Berndt A. Cushman J. Polle J. Magnuson J. Hegemann P. Deisseroth K. The microbial opsin family of optogenetic tools.Cell. 2011; 147: 1446-1457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Recently, a previously undescribed class of rhodopsin sequences has been found in several algal genomes including C. reinhardtii (8Kateriya S. Nagel G. Bamberg E. Hegemann P. “Vision” in single-celled algae.News Physiol. Sci. 2004; 19: 133-137PubMed Google Scholar). These rhodopsins are directly connected via the C terminus to a histidine kinase and a response regulator, defining a novel rhodopsin subfamily of histidine-kinase rhodopsins (HKRs). 5The abbreviations used are: HKRhistidine kinase rhodopsinBlblueBRbacteriorhodopsinEADSevolution-associated difference spectraESAexcited state absorptionGSBground state bleachingLEDlight-emitting diodeRhrhodopsinRRresponse regulator. C. reinhardtii contains four HKR sequences, two of them with an additional cyclase domain (Fig. 1, A and B). They are believed to constitute functional two-component systems. It has been suggested that these HKRs are involved in cell cycle regulation and circadian rhythmicity in the marine microalga Ostreococcus, but molecular characterization is still lacking (9Troein C. Corellou F. Dixon L.E. van Ooijen G. O'Neill J.S. Bouget F.Y. Millar A.J.

Response regulator fragments of HKR1 (accession number AAQ16277) fused with a Sumo tag were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified under nondenaturing conditions by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. Approximately 3 mg of affinity-purified HKR1-RR protein was provided to a commercial facility (Genie, Bangalore, India) for raising polyclonal antibody in rabbit. The antigenicity of a peptide from the rhodopsin domain of HKR1 was predicted by the web-based Kolaskar and Tongaonkar antigenic prediction tool (10Kolaskar A.S. Tongaonkar P.C. A semiempirical method for prediction of antigenic determinants on protein antigens.FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 172-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). The peptide was synthesized, and keyhole limpet hemocyanin was conjugated to its C terminus before injecting into rabbit. The specificity of each antibody was checked by immunoblotting by standard procedures using the respective affinity-purified proteins as antigens. Immunolocalization of HKR1 in C. reinhardtii was performed as described in the supplemental material. A humanized HKR1 sequence (amino acids 1–250) was heterologously expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris. Protein production was induced by the addition of 2.5% methanol and 5 μm all-trans-retinal to the growth medium. Protein purification was performed in a manner analogous to earlier described purification processes (11Bamann C. Kirsch T. Nagel G. Bamberg E.

All spectroscopic studies were performed in a HEPES buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.03% dodecyl maltoside. The pH dependence was tested using HEPES for pH 7.4 and 9 and citrate for pH 4.5 and 6. Absorption spectra and slow kinetics were recorded at 20 °C using a Cary 50 Bio spectrophotometer (Varian, Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) at a spectral resolution of 1.6 nm. Dark samples were measured after a dark adaptation period of 10 min. Light spectra were detected after a 1-min illumination with a 0.11-W UV- light-emitting diode (LED) (380 nm) or a 0.12-W blue LED (470 nm, both Nichia Corporation, Tokushima, Japan), respectively. Transient spectroscopy was performed at 19 °C on an LKS.60 flash photolysis system (Applied Photophysics Ltd., Leatherhead, UK) equipped with a tunable Rainbow OPO/Nd:YAG laser system and an Andor iStar ICCD Camera with 2-nm resolution (Andor Technology, Belfast, Northern Ireland). Laser energy was adjusted to 3 millijoules/shot, and the pulse duration was 10 ns. When excited with 483- or 355-nm laser pulses, the samples were preilluminated for 2 s with four 375- or 470-nm LEDs (4 × 0.1 W; Nichia Corporation, Tokushima, Japan), respectively. Further details have been described earlier (13Stierl M. Stumpf P. Udwari D. Gueta R. Hagedorn R. Losi A. Gärtner W. Petereit L. Efetova M. Schwarzel M. Oertner T.G. Nagel G. Hegemann P.

For data analysis, we used MATLAB (Release 2012a; The MathWorks, Natick, MA) and identified the significant components of the system by singular value decomposition. Subsequent target analysis with a sequential kinetic model yielded the kinetic constants, the component spectra, and the reconstructed data set. Spectrally resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with an instrument response function of 80 fs was carried out with a setup described earlier (15Berera R. van Grondelle R. Kennis J.T. Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy: principles and application to photosynthetic systems.Photosynth. Res. 2009; 101: 105-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To prevent multiple excitations of the same sample volume, the sample was moved in a Lissajous scanner as described previously (16Mathes T. Zhu J.Y. van Stokkum I.H.M. Groot M.L. Hegemann P.

HKR1 (500 μl; A380 ∼ 3) in H2O and D2O buffers (100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 0.03% dodecyl maltoside, pH/pD 7.4) was measured using a LabRam confocal setup (18Ly H.K. Wisitruangsakul N. Sezer M.

Chem. 2011; 660: 367-376Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Samples were continuously mixed, facilitated by a magnetic ball inside a rotating cuvette, and the accumulation time was 1 h at 1-mW excitation light. For Rh-Bl, the excitation wavelength was 514 nm and a background of UV LEDs (375 nm) was needed to accumulate sufficient amounts of this state. Without UV LED, Rh-Bl was excited by the laser to Rh-UV, and the spectra afforded only the Raman bands of the buffer. The spectra with and without UV LED were subtracted from each other to obtain the spectra free of buffer contributions. A similar procedure was used for the Rh-UV state, except for choosing an excitation line at 413 nm and blue LEDs (480 nm). Spectra were calibrated using toluene standard spectra, and a polynomial background was subtracted (BR-M410). Purified purple membrane from H. halobium strain S9 (2 ml, A570 ∼2; 10 mm Tris, pH 8) was measured using a 250-mW 514-nm pump and 25-mW 413-nm probe beams (delay time ∼1 ms and spectra acquisition time ∼4 h) using the rotating cuvette technique as described previously (19Naumann H. Murgida D.H. Engelhard M. Klare J.P. Hildebrandt P. Time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy of sensory rhodopsin II in the micro- and millisecond time range using gated cw excitation.J. Raman Spectrosc. 2006; 37: 436-441Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The 413-nm probe-only spectrum was used to subtract the Raman bands of the buffer. HPLC analysis of the extracted isomers of retinal was performed as described by Landers et al. (20Landers G.M. Olson J.A. Rapid, simultaneous determination of isomers of retinal, retinal oxime and retinol by high-performance liquid chromatography.J. Chromatogr. 1988; 438: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As a first action we produced antisera against the rhodopsin fragment (Rh) and the response regulator portion (RR) of HKR1 to localize the protein in the alga. Both antisera identified a 170-kDa protein in the membrane fraction of C. reinhardtii. Both antisera allowed us to localize HRK1 within the eyespot area of the alga as seen in Fig. 1C. In a second approach, we expressed the Rh fragment of HKR1 in the methylotrophic yeast P. pastoris complemented with all-trans retinal. The recombinant protein showed an absorption maximum at 380 nm (Fig. 1D), only a few nm shifted relative to the absorption of free retinal. However, the absorption was fine-structured, suggesting that the retinal was bound to protein without forming a protonated retinal Schiff base (12Bruun S. Naumann H. Kuhlmann U. Schulz C. Stehfest K. Hegemann P. Hildebrandt P. The chromophore structure of the long-lived intermediate of the C128T channelrhodopsin-2 variant.FEBS Lett. 2011; 585: 3998-4001Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Illumination of the protein with a 380-nm UV LED shifted the spectrum to 480 nm on the time scale of a few seconds (Fig. 1D). This blue-absorbing rhodopsin (Rh-Bl) was stable for hours (Fig. 1E), but it photochemically back-converted upon illumination with a blue LED (480 nm). Whereas the absorption spectra of Rh-UV and Rh-Bl were found to be pH-independent over the pH range from 6 to 9, we observed for Rh-UV an altered fine structure and a shift of the maximum of 5 nm for Rh-Bl at pH 4.5 (supplemental Fig. 1A). To decipher retinal composition, we extracted in preliminary experiments the retinoids after reaction with hydroxylamine and separated the isomers by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Unexpectedly, 13-cis retinal was the dominant isomer in Rh-UV. In contrast, Rh-Bl showed an enhanced all-trans fraction, suggesting that at least the main photochemical reaction in going from Rh-UV to Rh-Bl is a 13-cis to all-trans isomerization. During the extraction procedure retinoids tend to thermally isomerize in favor of all-trans; therefore, we more thoroughly characterized the structures of the chromophores in Rh-UV and Rh-Bl using resonance Raman spectroscopy. Resonance Raman spectra of the Rh-UV and Rh-Bl states of HKR1 were measured using 413-nm and 514-nm excitation, respectively. Photoconversion of Rh-UV and Rh-Bl by the exciting laser beam was compensated by continuous illumination with blue and UV LED light, respectively. The resonance Raman spectrum of Rh-Bl indicates the coexistence of two retinal isomers at similar relative contributions, as reflected by the two closely spaced C = C stretchings of the retinal chain at 1540 and 1550 cm−1 (Fig. 2A). Both chromophores are attached to the protein via protonated Schiff bases that give rise to two C = N stretching modes at 1633 and 1652 cm−1. The significant frequency difference between these two bands, which shift down to 1621 cm−1 upon H/D exchange (Fig. 2, inset), can at least partly be related to different hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interactions with the counter ion (21Gerscher S. Mylrajan M. Hildebrandt P. Baron M.H. Müller R. Engelhard M. Chromophore-anion interactions in halorhodopsin from Natronobacterium pharaonis probed by time-resolved resonance Raman spectroscopy.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11012-11020Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the Rh-UV state, however, there is no indication for structural heterogeneity of the chromophore (Fig. 2B). The C = C stretching mode at 1566 cm−1 displays a symmetric bandshape, and there is only a single band in the C = N stretching region at 1614 cm−1. The relatively low frequency of this band and the lack of isotopic shifts upon H/D exchange indicate a deprotonated Schiff base (Fig. 2, inset). In fact, comparison with the resonance Raman spectrum of the M410 state of bacteriorhodopsin comprising a deprotonated 13-cis retinal Schiff base demonstrates extensive similarities, with only small frequency differences for the conjugate bands (Fig. 2, B and C). Next, these were analyzed by flash photolysis on the microsecond to second time scale. The protein was accumulated in the UV state by a 1-s 480-nm LED light pulse and subsequently stimulated with a UV laser flash. Spectra were recorded at different times after the flash. Very little change was seen between 1 μs and 500 μs before the Rh-Bl appeared, with a rise time of τ = 2.3 ms (Fig. 3, A and B). No significant absorption change was seen during the conversion from Rh-UV to Rh-Bl, leading to the question of how the light energy was stored for such a long time before protonation of the retinal Schiff base occurred during the appearance of Rh-Bl. In contrary, the phototransformation from Rh-Bl back to Rh-UV resembles the photoinduced processes of known retinal proteins. Immediately after a blue laser flash, an early photointermediate, P560, appeared, which relaxed with a τ of 3.5 ms to a second species (P570) with a further red-shifted absorption. The latter disappeared with τ of 54 ms upon the formation of the Rh-UV state (Fig. 3, D and E); the difference spectra of the intermediates are shown in Fig. 3F. To decipher the early processes of the photoreactions, especially those of Rh-UV, we investigated the reactions of Rh-UV. Absorbance changes between 360 and 670 nm were recorded after excitation at 350 nm with a pulse width of about 80 fs at delay times of up to 3.5 ns. Background illumination of 450 nm was applied to keep the gross amount of Rh in the UV state. The time-resolved data were globally analyzed in terms of a sequential scheme of interconverting evolution-associated difference spectra (EADS) with increasing lifetimes (1->2->3-> … ). The first EADS (Fig. 4A, black) shows ground-state bleaching (GSB) near 380 nm and a broad excited-state absorption (ESA) that features two bands at ∼480 nm and 580 nm and can be assigned to the initially prepared excited state. This EADS evolves in 365 fs into the red EADS, which shows a small blue shift of the ESA to ∼470 nm, a slight loss between 500 and 670 nm, and a general narrowing of the absorbance features. The red EADS evolves within 5 ps into the green EADS, which is spectrally similar (Fig. 4A, green dashed spectrum) and shows an amplitude loss of approximately 50%. This EADS then decays within 60 ps into the nondecaying EADS (blue line in Fig. 4A), which shows an amplitude decrease to almost zero, leaving only a very small bleach at around 425 nm and an even smaller induced absorption near 450 nm. The kinetics of photoproduct formation are illustrated nicely by the absorbance change at 402 nm, which features both the large initial GSB and the small final product bleach (Fig. 4B). We interpret the spectral evolution as follows. (i) Upon preparation of the excited state in the Franck-Condon region, structural and/or vibrational relaxation takes place in 365 fs, resulting in narrowing and blue-shifting of the ESA. (ii) The relaxed excited state decays biexponentially with time constants of 5 and 60 ps, most likely due to the conformational heterogeneity of the protein. (iii) The final spectrum has a very small amplitude, which implies that the primary photoproduct has absorption characteristics that are very similar to that of the Rh-UV parent state. We propose that isomerization of the RSB takes place with time constants of 5 and 60 ps, but that due to a lack of chromophore-protein interactions, absorption changes after the isomerization of deprotonated RSB are very low. This interpretation is in line with the μs to ms flash photolysis experiments of Fig. 3, which show a spectrally silent deprotonated species before protonation occurs in 2.3 ms. The excited state lifetimes of 5 and 60 ps are unusually long for a rhodopsin (22Lutz I. Sieg A. Wegener A.A. Engelhard M. Boche I. Otsuka M. Oesterhelt D. Wachtveitl J. Zinth W. Primary reactions of sensory rhodopsins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 962-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Polland H.J. Franz M.A. Zinth W. Kaiser W. Kölling E. Oesterhelt D. Early picosecond events in the photocycle of Bacteriorhodopsin.Biophys. J. 1986; 49: 651-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). A study on unprotonated Schiff base model compounds showed that decreasing the polarity of the environment strongly increases the excited state lifetime (24Bachilo S.M. Gillbro T. Fluorescence of retinal Schiff base in alcohols.J. Phys. Chem. A. 1999; 103: 2481-2488Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the long lifetime of the Rh-UV S1 state is fully consistent with an unusually unpolar retinal binding pocket. Next, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was performed on Rh-Bl, with excitation at 500 nm and constant background illumination at 380 nm, to recover Rh-Bl. Global analysis indicated that four kinetic components are required for a satisfactory fit; the corresponding EADS are shown in Fig. 4C. The first EADS (black) is attributed to the initially prepared excited state of Rh-Bl, featuring a GSB at 480 nm and the ESA at 570 nm. This EADS evolves into the red EADS in 643 fs, which shows a similar GSB at reduced amplitude and a blue-shifted, narrowed ESA near 560 nm, indicative of structural and/or vibrational relaxation in the excited state. Additionally, a negative signal is observed around 720 nm, attributed to stimulated emission. As a result of extensive overlap with ESA, the stimulated emission signal is small. The next EADS (green) is formed in 4.5 ps. It features an overall loss in amplitude and a further blue shift of both the GSB (475 nm) and induced absorbance (550 nm). The final, nondecaying EADS is formed in 410 ps and shows a further blue shift of the GSB (460 nm) and an overall increase in intensity. The final EADS shows remarkable similarity to the difference spectrum obtained in the flash photolysis experiment after 1 μs (P560). A simple target model (Fig. 4E) was applied to the transient data set, which, in contrast to the sequential model described above, allows the disentanglement of branched reactions and ideally produces the true, so-called species-associated difference spectra. We included relaxation of the excited state, with subsequent biexponential decay to an intermediate (I1), and a final, nondecaying species, which is identical to the P560 intermediate from flash photolysis. Similar to previous investigations on channelrhodopsin-2 from C. reinhardtii (25Verhoefen M.K. Bamann C. Blöcher R. Förster U. Bamberg E. Wachtveitl J. The photocycle of channelrhodopsin-2: ultrafast reaction dynamics and subsequent reaction steps.ChemPhysChem. 2010; 11: 3113-3122Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we observe species-associated difference spectra (Fig. 4F) characteristic of vibrational and/or structural relaxation of the excited state in <300 fs, followed by a biexponential decay with 0.6 and 5 ps into I1. The excited state lifetimes are visible in the decay of stimulated emission at 720 nm (Fig. 4D) within the first 20 ps after the relaxation of the primary excited state. The I1 intermediate shows an overall blue shift of the difference spectrum compared with the excited state, along with a significant loss in signal. This difference spectrum represents a red shift of the absorbance of Rh-Bl, similar to that observed for J and K intermediates in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) (23Polland H.J. Franz M.A. Zinth W. Kaiser W.

The final P560 intermediate is formed from I1 within 400 ps along with a blue shift, an increase in negative contributions, and an increase but no spectral shift in the induced absorption. This behavior is also clearly illustrated by the absorbance change at 527 nm (Fig. 4D), which shows excited state absorption decaying within the first 20 ps and a slow increase at later delay times. The first spectroscopically characterized UV-rhodopsin belongs to a yet-uncharacterized class of HKRs (supplemental Fig. 2). The localization of HKR1 within the eyespot of C. reinhardtii originally surprised us because phototaxis was thought to be mediated exclusively by the channelrhodopsins ChR1 and ChR2 (26Berthold P. Tsunoda S.P. Ernst O.P. Mages W. Gradmann D. Hegemann P.

U.S.A. 2002; 99: 8689-8694Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar), and control of photobehavior has been considered the major if not exclusive role of the eye. However, because the proposed photoreceptor Chlamyopsin-2 (Cop2), which is involved in the assembling of photosystem-1 (28Ozawa S. Nield J. Terao A. Stauber E.J. Hippler M. Koike H. Rochaix J.D.

Biochemical and structural studies of the large Ycf4-photosystem I assembly complex of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Plant Cell. 2009; 21: 2424-2442Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), is also localized in the eye, it appears to be that algal eyes are more general sensory organelles. Furthermore, the fact that the dark-adapted Rh of HKR1 absorbs in the UV range is surprising because, to our knowledge, no specific UV response has ever been described for C. reinhardtii, suggesting that HKR1 mediates more general UV avoidance reactions or simply UV stress responses that modify sensory processes in the presence of UVA light. We have so far been unable to functionally reconstitute the complete HKR1 in E. coli or Xenopus oocytes as we have done previously for the small photoactivated cyclase bPAC (13Stierl M. Stumpf P. Udwari D. Gueta R. Hagedorn R. Losi A. Gärtner W. Petereit L. Efetova M. Schwarzel M. Oertner T.G. Nagel G. Hegemann P.

Chem. 2011; 286: 1181-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); therefore, we do not know whether HKR1 is a guanylyl cyclase or an adenylyl cyclase. cAMP has been suggested as an abiotic stress metabolite in C. reinhardtii whereas the role of cGMP is unknown. Intraflagellar cAMP increases upon sexual agglutination to reduce flagellar motility after the mating partners come in contact (29Saito T. Small L. Goodenough U.W. Activation of adenylyl-cyclase in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii by adhesion and by heat.J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). A regulatory role of cAMP within the eyespot organelle is conceivable. UVA-sensitive microbial rhodopsins have not been described so far but are now expected to be present in many algae. Functions for this “new” rhodopsin subfamily await further elucidation. C. reinhardtii additionally contains a UVB receptor, whose homolog, UVR8, has been recently characterized in Arabidopsis (30Christie J.M. Arvai A.S. Baxter K.J. Heilma"
https://openalex.org/W2097384076,"Autophagy is the main lysosomal catabolic process that becomes activated under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation and cytosolic Ca(2+) upload. However, the molecular details on how both conditions control autophagy are still not fully understood. Here we link essential amino acid starvation and Ca(2+) in a signaling pathway to activate autophagy. We show that withdrawal of essential amino acids leads to an increase in cytosolic Ca(2+), arising from both extracellular medium and intracellular stores, which induces the activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase kinase-β (CaMKK-β). Furthermore, we show that autophagy induced by amino acid starvation requires AMPK, as this induction is attenuated in its absence. Subsequently, AMPK activates UNC-51-like kinase (ULK1), a mammalian autophagy-initiating kinase, through phosphorylation at Ser-555 in a process that requires CaMKK-β. Finally, the mammalian target of rapamycin complex C1 (mTORC1), a negative regulator of autophagy downstream of AMPK, is inhibited by amino acid starvation in a Ca(2+)-sensitive manner, and CaMKK-β appears to be important for mTORC1 inactivation, especially in the absence of extracellular Ca(2+). All these results highlight that amino acid starvation regulates autophagy in part through an increase in cellular Ca(2+) that activates a CaMKK-β-AMPK pathway and inhibits mTORC1, which results in ULK1 stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2071327437,"Functional T-cell responses are initiated by physical interactions between T-cells and antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs) and B-cells. T-cells are activated more effectively by DCs than by B-cells, but little is known about the key molecular mechanisms that underpin the particular potency of DC in triggering T-cell responses. To better understand the influence of physical intercellular interactions on APC efficacy in activating T-cells, we used single cell force spectroscopy to characterize and compare the mechanical forces of interactions between DC:T-cells and B:T-cells. Following antigen stimulation, intercellular interactions of DC:T-cell conjugates were stronger than B:T-cell interactions. DCs induced higher levels of T-cell calcium mobilization and production of IL-2 and IFNγ than were elicited by B-cells, thus suggesting that tight intercellular contacts are important in providing mechanically stable environment to initiate T-cell activation. Blocking antibodies targeting surface co-stimulatory molecules CD80 or CD86 weakened intercellular interactions and dampen T-cell activation, highlighting the amplificatory roles of CD80/86 in regulating APC:T-cell interactions and T-cell functional activation. The variable strength of mechanical forces between DC:T-cells and B:T-cell interactions were not solely dependent on differential APC expression of CD80/86, since DCs were superior to B-cells in promoting strong interactions with T-cells even when CD80 and CD86 were inhibited. These data provide mechanical insights into the effects of co-stimulatory molecules in regulating APC:T-cell interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1998793556,"The increased expression of SIRT1 has recently been identified in numerous human tumors and a possible correlation with c-Myc oncogene has been proposed. However, it remains unclear whether SIRT1 functions as an oncogene or tumor suppressor. We sought to elucidate the role of SIRT1 in liver cancer under the influence of c-Myc and to determine the prognostic significance of SIRT1 and c-Myc expression in human hepatocellular carcinoma. The effect of either over-expression or knock down of SIRT1 on cell proliferation and survival was evaluated in both mouse and human liver cancer cells. Nicotinamide, an inhibitor of SIRT1, was also evaluated for its effects on liver tumorigenesis. The prognostic significance of the immunohistochemical detection of SIRT1 and c-Myc was evaluated in 154 hepatocellular carcinoma patients. SIRT1 and c-Myc regulate each other via a positive feedback loop and act synergistically to promote hepatocellular proliferation in both mice and human liver tumor cells. Tumor growth was significantly inhibited by nicotinamide in vivo and in vitro. In human hepatocellular carcinoma, SIRT1 expression positively correlated with c-Myc, Ki67 and p53 expression, as well as high á-fetoprotein level. Moreover, the expression of SIRT1, c-Myc and p53 were independent prognostic indicators of hepatocellular carcinoma. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that SIRT1 expression supports liver tumorigenesis and is closely correlated with oncogenic c-MYC expression. In addition, both SIRT1 and c-Myc may be useful prognostic indicators of hepatocellular carcinoma and SIRT1 targeted therapy may be beneficial in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."
https://openalex.org/W2059762258,"Today, humans inhabit most of the world's terrestrial habitats. This observation has been explained by the fact that we possess a secondary inheritance mechanism, culture, in addition to a genetic system. Because it is assumed that cultural evolution occurs faster than biological evolution, humans can adapt to new ecosystems more rapidly than other animals. This assumption, however, has never been tested empirically. Here, I compare rates of change in human technologies to rates of change in animal morphologies. I find that rates of cultural evolution are inversely correlated with the time interval over which they are measured, which is similar to what is known for biological rates. This correlation explains why the pace of cultural evolution appears faster when measured over recent time periods, where time intervals are often shorter. Controlling for the correlation between rates and time intervals, I show that (1) cultural evolution is faster than biological evolution; (2) this effect holds true even when the generation time of species is controlled for; and (3) culture allows us to evolve over short time scales, which are normally accessible only to short-lived species, while at the same time allowing for us to enjoy the benefits of having a long life history."

https://openalex.org/W1996122722,"The liver kinase B1 (LKB1) tumor suppressor inhibits cell growth through its regulation of cellular metabolism and apical–basal polarity. The best understood mechanism whereby LKB1 limits cell growth is through activation of the AMP-activated-protein-kinase/mammalian-target-of-rapamycin (AMPK/mTOR) pathway to control metabolism. As LKB1 is also required for polarized epithelial cells to resist hyperplasia, it is anticipated to function through additional mechanisms. Recently, Yes-associated protein (Yap) has emerged as a transcriptional co-activator that modulates tissue homeostasis in response to cell–cell contact. Thus this study examined a possible connection between Yap and LKB1. Restoration of LKB1 expression in HeLa cells, which lack this tumor suppressor, or short-hairpin RNA knockdown of LKB1 in NTERT immortalized keratinocytes, demonstrated that LKB1 promotes Yap phosphorylation, nuclear exclusion and proteasomal degradation. The ability of phosphorylation-defective Yap mutants to rescue LKB1 phenotypes, such as reduced cell proliferation and cell size, suggest that Yap inhibition contributes to LKB1 tumor suppressor function(s). However, failure of Lats1/2 knockdown to suppress LKB1-mediated Yap regulation suggested that LKB1 signals to Yap via a non-canonical pathway. Additionally, LKB1 inhibited Yap independently of either AMPK or mTOR activation. These findings reveal a novel mechanism whereby LKB1 may restrict cancer cell growth via the inhibition of Yap."

Members of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily play essential roles in a variety of physiological and biological processes including embryonic development, tumorigenesis, inflammation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1Massagué J. TGF-β signal transduction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3982) Google Scholar). The canonical signaling events induced by TGF-βs start by binding of the ligands to the cognate type II receptor that then recruits type I receptor to form the heteromeric complex where TGF-β type I receptor (TβRI) 3The abbreviations used are: TβRITGF-β type I receptorcaTβRIconstitutively active TβRICUEcoupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradationEEA1early endosomal autoantigen-1IL-1interleukin-1MHMad-homology domainTBDtarget of Myb1 (Tom1) binding domainC2protein kinase C conserved region 2. is activated by phosphorylation in its GS domain (2Wrana J.L.

The activated TβRI phosphorylates and activates receptor-restrictive Smads (i.e. Smad2 and Smad3 for TGF-β signaling) which form a heterocomplex with the common Smad, Smad4. The activated Smad complex is translocated into the nucleus, where it regulates the expression of the target genes (1Massagué J. TGF-β signal transduction.Annu. Rev.

Smad7, consisting of MH1 and MH2 domains, is one of the key negative regulators of TGF-β signaling pathway. Smad7 antagonizes TGF-β signaling through multiple mechanisms, such as by interfering with the recruitment of receptor-restrictive Smads into the type I receptor upon ligand activation (4Nakao A.

Endocytosis of cell surface receptors is an important regulatory event in signal transduction. Like most other cell surface proteins, TGF-β receptors undergo endocytosis and degradation upon activation (9Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-β receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The internalization process of TGF-β receptors takes place mainly through two distinct endocytic pathways including clathrin- and caveolin-mediated pathways. The clathrin-mediated endocytosis targets receptors to the early endosomes in which the receptors may continue their signaling activity (9Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-β receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). The internalized receptors can be sorted to late endosomes and targeted to lysosomes for degradation (10Chen Y.G. Endocytic regulation of TGF-β signaling.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the lipid-raft-mediated caveolar internalization contains the Smad7-Smurf2 complex and facilitates receptor degradation (9Di Guglielmo G.M. Le Roy C. Goodfellow A.F. Wrana J.L. Distinct endocytic pathways regulate TGF-β receptor signalling and turnover.Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 410-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar). Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) was initially identified as an adaptor protein involved in the signaling of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor (11Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Tollip, a new component of the IL-1RI pathway, links IRAK to the IL-1 receptor.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). It is a small protein consisting of 274 residues in humans and contains a C2 (protein kinase C conserved region 2) domain in the central region. One of the major functions of the C2 domain is to anchor Tollip to the sorting endosomes (12Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K.

Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Tollip also contains a CUE (coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation) domain in the C terminus, and this domain functions as an interaction motif for ubiquitinated proteins (13Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). In the N terminus Tollip contains a Tom1 binding domain (TBD) that is involved in the interaction with Tom1, a protein that binds ubiquitinated proteins (14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H.

Via its endosome-targeting domain and ubiquitin binding domains, Tollip is required for intracellular trafficking of IL-1 receptor and the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of the receptor (15Brissoni B.

In addition, Tollip can interact with IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) before IL-1β stimulation and suppress the kinase activity of IRAK-1 (11Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F.

In agreement with the observations that Tollip plays a crucial role in the signaling of IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptors, the mice depleted of Tollip have dysregulated inflammatory cytokine production in response to IL-1β and lipopolysaccharide (19Didierlaurent A.

Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In the present study we identified that Tollip is able to interact with Smad7. Functionally, Tollip suppresses TGF-β signaling via cooperation with Smad7. Smad7 facilitates recruitment of Tollip to TβRI. Subsequently, Tollip preferentially associates with ubiquitinated TβRI and accelerates degradation of activated TβRI. These findings, therefore, uncover a novel function of Tollip in the regulation of TGF-β signaling pathway. Human Tollip cDNA and its truncation mutants were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) with a FLAG epitope tag added to the N terminus by a PCR-based method. The GFP-tagged Tollip was constructed by subcloning into pEGFPc1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) to fuse with an enhanced green fluorescence protein at the N terminus. The human Smad7 (including its truncation mutants) and Smad2 were subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pCS2+MT with six Myc tags at the N terminus. The constructs of Smurf1, TβRI, and its constitutively active mutant were gifts from Dr. Yeguang Chen (Tsinghua University, Beijing, China). All clones were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The Tollip short hairpin RNA (shRNA) and Smad7 shRNA constructs were generated using a lentiviral system as previously reported (20Qin X.F. An D.S. Chen I.S. Baltimore D.

In short, the annealed small interfering RNA (siRNA) cassettes with targeting sequences of AGCCATGGAGGACATGTTC for human Tollip or AGGTCACCACCATCCCCA for human Smad7 were inserted into the pBS-SKII-hU6 vector downstream of the hU6 promoter. The siRNA expression cassette was then subcloned into the FG12 vector and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The FG12 plasmid containing Tollip or Smad7 shRNA was directly used in cell transfection to silence expression of endogenous Tollip or Smad7. The antibodies were purchased as follows: rabbit anti-phospho-Smad2, anti-Tollip and anti-Snail antibodies from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA); anti-Myc, anti-HA, anti-total Smad2, anti-Smad7, anti-vimentin, and anti-ubiquitin antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); mouse anti-FLAG antibody from Sigma; rabbit anti-TβRI and anti-GM130 antibodies from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); rabbit anti-EEA1 antibody from BD Biosciences; Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse IgG, Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-mouse, rabbit IgG, and Hoechst 33342 from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); Cy-5-labeled goat anti-mouse and rabbit IgG from Jackson ImmunoResearch (Baltimore Pike, PA). HEK293T cells, HepG2 cells, HeLa cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured at 37 °C in 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Transient transfection was performed using PolyJet™ DNA in Vitro Transfection Reagent (SignaGen Laboratories, Rockville, MD) for HepG2 cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, calcium phosphate precipitation or polyethyleneimine method for HEK293T and HeLa cells.

We used a luciferase assay kit (KenReal, Shanghai, China) to measure the luciferase activity with a luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Reporter activity was normalized to co-transfected Renilla. The experiments were repeated in triplicate. Immunoprecipitation was performed as previously described (22Feng L. Xie X. Ding Q. Luo X.

In short, the cells were washed with cold PBS and homogenized in buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm sucrose with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) 20 times with a 22-gauge needle and 5 times with a 26 gauge needle. The nuclei were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. After measurement of protein concentration, a 10-20-30% continuous gradient was generated by mixing postnuclear supernatant 1:1 with 60% iodixanol (Opti-Prep, Axis-Shield PoC, Oslo, Norway) and layered under 1.2 ml of 20% iodixanol with 1.2 ml of 10% iodixanol at the top of the centrifuge tubes. The samples were centrifuged at 260,000 × g for 3 h at 4 °C. Statistical significance was assessed by Student's t test. We originally used a yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that interact with full-length Smad7 and found that Tollip was one of the Smad7-interacting proteins. 4Y. Chen, unpublished data. We confirmed the interaction between Smad7 and Tollip by co-immunoprecipitation assays. When Smad7 and Tollip were co-expressed in HEK293T cells, they could interact with each other (Fig. 1A). The interaction of Tollip with Smad7 was not affected by TGF-β1 treatment (Fig. 1B). In addition, we found that endogenous Tollip could interact with endogenous Smad7 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, Tollip only interacted with Smad7 but not Smad2 (supplemental Fig. S1). We next investigated the functional domain(s) of Tollip implicated in the interaction with Smad7. Tollip contains three functional domains, TBD, C2, and CUE (coupling of ubiquitin to endoplasmic reticulum degradation), as shown in Fig. 1D (13Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L. A ubiquitin-binding motif required for intramolecular monoubiquitylation, the CUE domain.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 14Yamakami M. Yoshimori T. Yokosawa H. Tom1, a VHS domain-containing protein, interacts with tollip, ubiquitin, and clathrin.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52865-52872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Smad7 bound efficiently to the full-length Tollip and the mutants with either TBD or CUE being deleted (Fig. 1E). However, no interaction could be detected between Smad7 and Tollip deleted of the C2 domain (Fig. 1E). These results indicate that the C2 domain of Tollip is required for the interaction of Tollip with Smad7. In addition, we analyzed which domain of Smad7 is involved in its interaction with Tollip. We demonstrated that the MH2 domain of Smad7 was sufficient to mediate the interaction with Tollip (Fig. 1F). Collectively, these data reveal that the C2 domain of Tollip is able to specifically interact with the MH2 domain of Smad7. To assess the functional role of Tollip on TGF-β signaling, we first examined the effect of Tollip overexpression on TGF-β-induced transcriptional response using a luciferase reporter that contained four repeats of Smad binding elements as previously described (26Nagarajan R.P. Chen F. Li W. Vig E. Harrington M.A. Nakshatri H. Chen Y. Repression of transforming-growth-factor-beta-mediated transcription by nuclear factor κB.Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 591-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). As expected, we found that overexpression of the constitutively active TGF-β type I receptor (caTβRI) was able to stimulate the luciferase reporter in both HEK293T and HepG2 cells (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). However, overexpression of Tollip in these two cell lines could significantly reduce caTβRI-mediated activation of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S2). Consistently, TGF-β1-stimulated transcriptional response was lessened by Tollip overexpression in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these results indicate that Tollip is inhibitory to TGF-β-mediated signaling pathway. To further confirm the inhibitory activity of Tollip on TGF-β signaling, we stimulated HepG2 cells with TGF-β1 in the presence or absence of Tollip overexpression and analyzed TGF-β1-mediated phosphorylation of Smad2. Although TGF-β1 treatment could markedly induce phosphorylation of Smad2 in these cells, overexpression of Tollip profoundly suppressed TGF-β-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 (Fig. 2C). Consistently, the TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation was enhanced by knockdown of Tollip in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2D). On the other hand, knockdown of Smad7 could abrogate the inhibitory effect of Tollip on TGF-β1-induced Smad2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2E), indicating that the inhibitory effect of Tollip on TGF-β signaling is dependent on Smad7. The effectiveness of using shRNA to silence Tollip and Smad7 in these cells was confirmed by real time RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses (supplemental Fig. S3). To analyze the potential effect of Tollip on TGF-β action, we examined whether Tollip could alter TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition in HepG2 cells. As expected, TGF-β1 treatment could elevate the protein levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers including Snail and vimentin (Fig. 3A). At the mRNA level, TGF-β1 treatment could significantly reduce E-cadherin expression while increasing the expression levels of N-cadherin, Twist, Slug, Zeb1, and Zeb2 (Fig. 3B). However, Tollip overexpression could attenuate TGF-β1-induced alterations of these epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers (Fig. 3). Collectively, these data indicate that overexpression of Tollip has a negative effect on TGF-β signaling and function. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the inhibitory effect of Tollip on TGF-β signaling, we analyzed the interaction between Tollip and TβRI. Using a co-immunoprecipitation assay, we found that Tollip could efficiently bind to TβRI (Fig. 4A). Deletion of either TBD or CUE domain had no obvious effect on the interaction between Tollip and TβRI (Fig. 4A). However, deletion of both the TBD and CUE domains led to complete loss of the interaction capacity of Tollip with TβRI (Fig. 4A). We also found that endogenous Tollip could interact with endogenous TβRI in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, TGF-β1 treatment appeared to elevate the interaction between Tollip and TβRI (Fig. 4C), indicating that Tollip preferentially binds activated TβRI. To establish the role of Smad7 in the Tollip/TβRI interaction, we used shRNA to knock down Smad7 and observed that the Tollip/TβRI interaction was significantly abolished with Smad7 down-regulation (Fig. 4D). Consistently, Smad7 depletion in Smad7-depleted mouse embryonic fibroblasts could significantly reduce colocalization of Tollip with caTβRI (supplemental Fig. S4). We next investigated the effect of overexpressed Smad7 on the interaction of Tollip with TβRI. In a co-immunoprecipitation experiment, we found that overexpression of Smad7 could profoundly enhance the association between Tollip and TβRI (Fig. 4E). The importance of Smad7 on Tollip/TβRI interaction was further analyzed by a confocal experiment. When Tollip and caTβRI were coexpressed, there was little colocalization of Tollip with caTβRI in the cell (Fig. 4F, upper panel). However, overexpression of Smad7 could markedly enhance the co-localization of Tollip with caTβRI (Fig. 4F, lower panel and supplemental Fig. S5A), further supporting our findings that Smad7 is required for the interaction of Tollip with caTβRI and that the inhibitory effect of Tollip on TGF-β signaling is dependent on Smad7 (Fig. 2E). Previous studies have revealed that both of the TBD and CUE domains of Tollip are involved in interaction with ubiquitinated proteins (12Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and recruit ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 13Shih S.C. Prag G. Francis S.A. Sutanto M.A. Hurley J.H. Hicke L.

As both the TBD and CUE domains are required for the interaction of Tollip with TβRI (Fig. 4A), we therefore postulated that Tollip is able to bind ubiquitinated TβRI. To test this hypothesis, we co-expressed caTβRI with Tollip and investigated the ubiquitination status of TβRI. As shown in Fig. 5A, caTβRI could be efficiently pulled down by wild type Tollip and its mutant TollipΔTBD but not by other mutants that lacked CUE (TollipΔCUE) or both TBD and CUE (TollipΔC/T). Interestingly, Tollip interacted more efficiently with the high molecular weight forms of TβRI (Fig. 5A, top left panel). Importantly, the high molecular weight forms of TβRI contained ubiquitin (Fig. 5A, top right panel). The ubiquitination status of caTβRI associated with Tollip was further analyzed by a two-step coimmunoprecipitation experiment. Both caTβRI and Tollip were coexpressed in HEK293T cells, and the FLAG-tagged Tollip was first immunoprecipitated by an anti-FLAG antibody. The immunoprecipitated proteins were dissociated from the beads by incubation with FLAG peptide and subjected to second round immunoprecipitation to isolate caTβRI that was associated with Tollip. Consistently, we found that the Tollip-associated caTβRI did contain ubiquitin (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, deletion of both the CUE and TBD domain lost the capacity to associate with ubiquitinated caTβRI. Together, these data indicate that Tollip preferentially associates with ubiquitinated caTβRI. Ubiquitination of TβRI is commonly associated with protein degradation (5Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Smad7 binds to Smurf2 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the TGF β receptor for degradation.Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). As Tollip is able to associate with ubiquitinated caTβRI, we hypothesized that such interaction would facilitate degradation of caTβRI. To address this hypothesis, we examined the half-life of caTβRI in the presence or absence of Tollip overexpression. The cells were treated with cycloheximide to block new protein biosynthesis. Consistent with a previous report (27Yan X. Lin Z. Chen F. Zhao X. Chen H. Ning Y. Chen Y.G. Human BAMBI cooperates with Smad7 to inhibit transforming growth factor-β signaling.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 30097-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), the half-life of caTβRI was very long when expressed alone (Fig. 6A). However, when it was co-expressed with Tollip, degradation of caTβRI was significantly accelerated (Fig. 6A). Intriguingly, deletion of both TBD and CUE domains abrogated the pro-degradation effect of Tollip on caTβRI, consistent with our findings that these two domains are required for the association of Tollip with ubiquitinated caTβRI (Fig. 4A). Because Smad7 recruits Smurfs to ubiquitinate activated TβRI for its degradation, we examined the half-life of caTβRI with overexpression of Smad7, Smurf1, and Tollip (supplemental Fig. S6). As expected, overexpression of Smad7 or Tollip alone could elevate degradation of caTβRI. Coexpression of Smad7 and Smurf1 could further increase caTβRI degradation. Interestingly, Tollip and Smad7 had a synergistic effect on caTβRI degradation, indicating that Tollip can cooperate with Smad7 to accelerate TβRI degradation. However, Tollip had no effect to further enhance Smad7/Smurf1-mediated caTβRI degradation. In addition, we observed that Tollip did not alter the interaction of Smad7 with Smurf1 (supplemental Fig. S7). These data, therefore, indicate that Tollip does not affect Smad7-mediated recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases and Smurf-mediated ubiquitination of TβR1. As protein degradation is commonly associated with alteration in subcellular compartmentalization (28Katzmann D.J. Babst M. Emr S.D.

Traub L.M. Signals for sorting of transmembrane proteins to endosomes and lysosomes.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 395-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar), we used gradient fractionation to examine the effect of Tollip on subcellular distribution of caTβRI. According to previous reports (24Chen X.W. Inoue M. Hsu S.C. Saltiel A.R. RalA-exocyst-dependent recycling endosome trafficking is required for the completion of cytokinesis.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38609-38616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 25Xie X. Gong Z. Mansuy-Aubert V. Zhou Q.L. Tatulian S.A. Sehrt D. Gnad F. Brill L.M. Motamedchaboki K.

C2 domain-containing phosphoprotein CDP138 regulates GLUT4 insertion into the plasma membrane.Cell Metab. 2011; 14: 378-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), the lower density fractions mainly contains plasma membrane, whereas the middle density fractions contain large organelles including Golgi apparatus and the higher density fractions mainly consist of small organelles including endosomal structures. When caTβRI was expressed alone, it was mainly distributed in the fractions containing large subcellular organelles (Fig. 6B). However, when co-expressed with Tollip, caTβRI was partially redistributed from the middle density fractions to the higher density fractions that mainly contain endosomes (Fig. 6B). It is noteworthy that Tollip contains an endosome anchoring domain, i.e. the C2 domain (12Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and recruit ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). We, therefore, hypothesized that Tollip might facilitate TβRI degradation by targeting the receptor to the endosomes. To address this issue, we analyzed the co-localization of caTβRI with an early endosome marker EEA1. When caTβRI was expressed alone, it barely had any colocalization with EEA1 (Fig. 6C, top panel). However, when caTβRI was coexpressed with Tollip, both of the proteins were apparently colocalized with EEA1 (Fig. 6C, lower panel, and supplemental Fig. S5B), furthering indicating that Tollip is able to enhance compartmentalization of TβRI to the endosomes. The duration and intensity of TGF-β signaling is precisely controlled at different levels from ligand availability and receptor stability to Smads activity (30Lönn P. Morén A. Raja E. Dahl M. Moustakas A. Regulating the stability of TGFβ receptors and Smads.Cell Res. 2009; 19: 21-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The activity of TGF-β receptor is tightly regulated by a set of their interacting proteins. One of the key negative regulators, Smad7, antagonizes TGF-β signaling mainly by inhibiting receptor-restrictive Smads activation (4Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Morén A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata M. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. ten Dijke P. Identification of Smad7, a TGFβ-inducible antagonist of TGF-β signalling.Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar) and inducing degradation of TβRI via recruitment of E3 ubiquitin ligases (5Kavsak P. Rasmussen R.K. Causing C.G. Bonni S. Zhu H. Thomsen G.H. Wrana J.L. Smad7 binds to Smurf2 to form an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets the TGF β receptor for degradation.Mol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12477-12480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). In this study we found that Tollip is able to interact with Smad7 and inhibit TGF-β signaling and action. Tollip is also able to interact with ubiquitinated TβRI and Smad7 facilitates such interaction. Consistently, two ubiquitin-associated domains of Tollip including CUE and TBD domains are required for the interaction between Tollip and TβRI. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Tollip is able accelerate degradation, alter subcellular distribution, and elevate endosome localization of TβRI. Collectively, our studies indicate that Tollip acts an adaptor protein that regulates the compartmentalization and degradation of TβRI. Our findings are consistent with the known functions of Tollip in regulating the signaling of IL-1 receptor. Tollip was initially identified as an important constituent of the IL-1 receptor signaling pathway (11Burns K. Clatworthy J. Martin L. Martinon F. Plumpton C. Maschera B. Lewis A. Ray K. Tschopp J. Volpe F. Tollip, a new component of the IL-1RI pathway, links IRAK to the IL-1 receptor.Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Recent studies have revealed that Tollip is implicated in the ubiquitination and endocytosis of IL-1 receptor (15Brissoni B. Agostini L. Kropf M. Martinon F. Swoboda V. Lippens S. Everett H. Aebi N. Janssens S. Meylan E. Felberbaum-Corti M. Hirling H. Gruenberg J. Tschopp J. Burns K. Intracellular trafficking of interleukin-1 receptor I requires Tollip.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2265-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Tollip is a modular protein that contains three functional domains: an N-terminal TBD, a central C2 domain, and a C-terminal CUE domain. The CUE domain of Tollip directly binds ubiquitinated proteins, whereas the C2 domain is responsible for the association with endosomal membranes. On the other hand, Tom1 is also able to associate with ubiquitinated proteins. Therefore, Tollip is able to bind ubiquitinated proteins directly via its CUE domain or indirectly via its TBD domain. Because of the properties of its functional domains, Tollip has been found to be an important player in regulating endosomal trafficking of ubiquitinated proteins (12Katoh Y. Shiba Y. Mitsuhashi H. Yanagida Y. Takatsu H. Nakayama K. Tollip and Tom1 form a complex and recruit ubiquitin-conjugated proteins onto early endosomes.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24435-24443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 15Brissoni B. Agostini L. Kropf M. Martinon F. Swoboda V. Lippens S. Everett H. Aebi N. Janssens S. Meylan E. Felberbaum-Corti M. Hirling H. Gruenberg J. Tschopp J. Burns K. Intracellular trafficking of interleukin-1 receptor I requires Tollip.Curr. Biol. 2006; 16: 2265-2270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Based on our findings, we propose a model to depict the functional roles of Tollip in modulating TGF-β signaling (Fig. 7). The C2 domain of Tollip interacts with the MH2 domain of Smad7. Through such interaction, Tollip is recruited to the activated TβRI. Via the two ubiquitin-associated domains (CUE and TBD), Tollip is able to form a stable complex with ubiquitinated TβRI. Subsequently, the Tollip-TβRI complex is routed to endosomal compartment and subjected to protein degradation. Based on this model, Smad7 plays two important roles in facilitating degradation of TβRI. On the one hand, Smad7 can recruit E3 ligases (Smurfs) to TβRI and initiate the ubiquitination of the receptor. On the other hand, Smad7 functions as an adaptor protein to assist in recruitment of Tollip to the ubiquitinated TβRI and facilitate the subsequent endosomal trafficking and degradation of the receptor. However, a few issues with this model need to be clarified in the future. First, it is not clear how endosomal trafficking of TβRI is coupled to protein degradation. It is likely that the Tollip-mediated compartmentalization of TβRI is later sorted to late endosomes or lysosomes for degradation. Second, it is unclear whether Tollip plays a role in the crosstalk between IL-1 and TGF-β signaling pathways, as Tollip is a known modulator of IL-1 signaling (16Zhang G. Ghosh S. Negative regulation of toll-like receptor-mediated signaling by Tollip.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7059-7065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). A few studies have reported IL-1 can influence TGF-β signaling (31Fan J.M. Huang X.R. Ng Y.Y. Nikolic-Paterson D.J. Mu W. Atkins R.C. Lan H.Y. Interleukin-1 induces tubular epithelial-myofibroblast transdifferentiation through a transforming growth factor-β1-dependent mechanism in vitro.Am. J.

Pathol. 2004; 164: 2055-2066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Interleukin-1 receptor antagonist-deficient mice exhibit suppressed TGF-β signaling, whereas IL-1 signaling is enhanced (33Ishida Y. Kondo T. Kimura A. Matsushima K. Mukaida N. Absence of IL-1 receptor antagonist impaired wound healing along with aberrant NF-κB activation and a reciprocal suppression of TGF-β signal pathway.J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 5598-5606Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). If the intracellular amount of Tollip were a rate-limiting factor, recruitment of Tollip to the IL-1 receptor would prevent it from interacting with TβRI, leading to reduced degradation of TβRI and enhanced TGF-β signaling. In contrast, binding of Tollip to TβRI would also limit its availability to IL-1 receptor. Third, what is the physiological importance of Tollip in regulating TGF-β functions? The mice depleted of Tollip have dysregulated inflammatory responses (19Didierlaurent A. Brissoni B. Velin D. Aebi N. Tardivel A. Käslin E. Sirard J.C. Angelov G. Tschopp J. Burns K. Tollip regulates proinflammatory responses to interleukin-1 and lipopolysaccharide.Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 735-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As TGF-β plays a pivotal role in modulating immune response, it will be important to elucidate in the future whether the dysregulated inflammatory responses in Tollip-ablated mice is partially mediated by alterations in TGF-β signaling pathway.

https://openalex.org/W2025408537,"Long chain acyl-CoA synthetases are essential enzymes of lipid metabolism, and have also been implicated in the cellular uptake of fatty acids. It is controversial if some or all of these enzymes have an additional function as fatty acid transporters at the plasma membrane. The most abundant acyl-CoA synthetases in adipocytes are FATP1, ACSVL4/FATP4 and ACSL1. Previous studies have suggested that they increase fatty acid uptake by direct transport across the plasma membrane. Here, we used a gain-of-function approach and established FATP1, ACSVL4/FATP4 and ACSL1 stably expressing 3T3-L1 adipocytes by retroviral transduction. All overexpressing cell lines showed increased acyl-CoA synthetase activity and fatty acid uptake. FATP1 and ACSVL4/FATP4 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum by confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation whereas ACSL1 was found on mitochondria. Insulin increased fatty acid uptake but without changing the localization of FATP1 or ACSVL4/FATP4. We conclude that overexpressed acyl-CoA synthetases are able to facilitate fatty acid uptake in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The intracellular localization of FATP1, ACSVL4/FATP4 and ACSL1 indicates that this is an indirect effect. We suggest that metabolic trapping is the mechanism behind the influence of acyl-CoA synthetases on cellular fatty acid uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2045336306,"Core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (C2GnT1) is a key enzyme participating in the synthesis of core 2-associated sialyl Lewis x (C2-O-sLe(x)), a ligand involved in selectin-mediated leukocyte trafficking and cancer metastasis. To accomplish that, C2GnT1 needs to be localized to the Golgi and this step requires interaction of its cytoplasmic tail (CT) with a protein that has not been identified. Employing C2GnT1 CT as the bait to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen, we have identified Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) as a principal candidate protein that interacts with C2GnT1 and demonstrated that C2GnT1 binds to GOLPH3 via the LLRRR(9) sequence in the CT. Confocal fluorescence microscopic analysis shows substantial Golgi co-localization of C2GnT1 and GOLPH3. Upon GOLPH3 knockdown, C2GnT1 is found mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and decorated with complex-type N-glycans, indicating that the enzyme has been transported to the Golgi but is not retained. Also, we have found that a recombinant protein consisting of C2GnT1 CT(1-16)-Leu(17-32)-Gly(33-42)-GFP is localized to the Golgi although the same construct with mutated CT (AAAAA(9)) is not. The data demonstrate that the C2GnT1 CT is necessary and sufficient for Golgi localization of C2GnT1. Furthermore, GOLPH3 knockdown results in reduced synthesis of C2-O-sLe(x) associated with P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1, reduced cell tethering to and rolling on immobilized P- or E-selectin, and compromised E-selectin-induced activation of spleen tyrosine kinase and cell adhesion to intercellular adhesion molecule-1 under dynamic flow. Our results reveal that GOLPH3 can regulate cell-cell interaction by controlling Golgi retention of C2GnT1."
https://openalex.org/W2148776605,"Treatment options for adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the salivary gland, a slowly growing tumor with propensity for neuroinvasion and late recurrence, are limited to surgery and radiotherapy. Based on expression analysis performed on clinical specimens of salivary cancers, we identified in ACC expression of the neurotrophin-3 receptor TrkC/NTRK3, neural crest marker SOX10, and other neurologic genes. Here, we characterize TrkC as a novel ACC marker, which was highly expressed in 17 out of 18 ACC primary-tumor specimens, but not in mucoepidermoid salivary carcinomas or head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Expression of the TrkC ligand NT-3 and Tyr-phosphorylation of TrkC detected in our study suggested the existence of an autocrine signaling loop in ACC with potential therapeutic significance. NT-3 stimulation of U2OS cells with ectopic TrkC expression triggered TrkC phosphorylation and resulted in Ras, Erk 1/2 and Akt activation, as well as VEGFR1 phosphorylation. Without NT-3, TrkC remained unphosphorylated, stimulated accumulation of phospho-p53 and had opposite effects on p-Akt and p-Erk 1/2. NT-3 promoted motility, migration, invasion, soft-agar colony growth and cytoskeleton restructuring in TrkC-expressing U2OS cells. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that TrkC-positive ACC specimens also show high expression of Bcl2, a Trk target regulated via Erk 1/2, in agreement with activation of the TrkC pathway in real tumors. In normal salivary gland tissue, both TrkC and Bcl2 were expressed in myoepithelial cells, suggesting a principal role for this cell lineage in the ACC origin and progression. Sub-micromolar concentrations of a novel potent Trk inhibitor AZD7451 completely blocked TrkC activation and associated tumorigenic behaviors. Pre-clinical studies on ACC tumors engrafted in mice showed efficacy and low toxicity of AZD7451, validating our in vitro data and stimulating more research into its clinical application. In summary, we describe in ACC a previously unrecognized pro-survival neurotrophin signaling pathway and link it with cancer progression."
https://openalex.org/W2045755077,"One of the causes of breast cancer is overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Enhanced receptor autophosphorylation and resistance to activation-induced downregulation have been suggested as mechanisms for HER2-induced sustained signaling and cell transformation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these possibilities remain incompletely understood. In the current report, we present evidence that show that HER2 overexpression does not lead to receptor hyper-autophosphorylation, but alters patterns in a manner that favors receptor stability and sustained signaling. Specifically, HER2 overexpression blocks epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine phosphorylation on Y1045 and Y1068, the known docking sites of c-Cbl and Grb2, respectively, whereas promoting phosphorylation on Y1173, the known docking site of the Gab adaptor proteins and phospholipase C gamma. Under these conditions, HER2 itself is phosphorylated on Y1221/1222, with no known role, and on Y1248 that corresponds to Y1173 of EGFR. Interestingly, suppressed EGFR autophosphorylation on the Grb2 and c-Cbl-binding sites correlated with receptor stability and sustained signaling, suggesting that HER2 accomplishes these tasks by altering autophosphorylation patterns. In conformity with these findings, mutation of the Grb2-binding site on EGFR (Y1068F–EGFR) conferred resistance to ligand-induced degradation, which in turn induced sustained signaling, and increased cell proliferation and transformation. These findings suggest that the Grb2-binding site on EGFR is redundant for signaling, but critical for receptor regulation. On the other hand, mutation of the putative Grb2-binding site in HER2 (Y1139) did not affect stability, signaling or transformation, suggesting that Y1139 in HER2 may not serve as a Grb2-binding site. In agreement with the role of EGFR in HER2 signaling, inhibition of EGFR expression reduced HER2-induced anchorage-independent growth and tumorigenesis. These results imply that complementing HER2-targeted therapies with anti-EGFR drugs may be beneficial in HER2-positive breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1994861981,"Oxidizing equivalents for the process of oxidative protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of mammalian cells are mainly provided by the Ero1α oxidase. The molecular mechanisms that regulate Ero1α activity in order to harness its oxidative power are quite well understood. However, the overall cellular response to oxidative stress generated by Ero1α in the lumen of the mammalian ER is poorly characterized. Here we investigate the effects of overexpressing a hyperactive mutant (C104A/C131A) of Ero1α. We show that Ero1α hyperactivity leads to hyperoxidation of the ER oxidoreductase ERp57 and induces expression of two established unfolded protein response (UPR) targets, BiP (immunoglobulin-binding protein) and HERP (homocysteine-induced ER protein). These effects could be reverted or aggravated by N-acetylcysteine and buthionine sulfoximine, respectively. Because both agents manipulate the cellular glutathione redox buffer, we conclude that the observed effects of Ero1α-C104A/C131A overexpression are likely caused by an oxidative perturbation of the ER glutathione redox buffer. In accordance, we show that Ero1α hyperactivity affects cell viability when cellular glutathione levels are compromised. Using microarray analysis, we demonstrate that the cell reacts to the oxidative challenge caused by Ero1α hyperactivity by turning on the UPR. Moreover, this analysis allowed the identification of two new targets of the mammalian UPR, CRELD1 and c18orf45. Interestingly, a broad antioxidant response was not induced. Our findings suggest that the hyperoxidation generated by Ero1α-C104A/C131A is addressed in the ER lumen and is unlikely to exert oxidative injury throughout the cell."

FliC, as a flagellar filament structural protein, is hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of infection. In this study, a fliC in-frame deletion mutant of a virulent isolate of E. tarda was constructed through double crossover allelic exchange by means of the suicide vector pRE112, and its virulence-associated phenotypes and pathogenicity were tested. It was found that the deletion of fliC significantly decreased the diameter of flagella filaments. In addition, the mutant showed reduced pathogenicity to fish by increasing the LD50 value for 100-fold compared to the wild-type strain, as well as showed impaired bacterial growth, reduced motility, decreased biofilm formation and reduced levels of virulence-associated protein secretion involved in the type III secretion system (TTSS). The phenotypic characteristics of the fliC deletion mutant uncovered in this investigation suggest that fliC plays an essential role in normal flagellum function, bacterial growth, protein secretion by TTSS and bacterial virulence."
https://openalex.org/W1988708761,"The RNA polymerase II (Pol II) C-terminal domain (CTD) serves as a docking site for numerous proteins, bridging various nuclear processes to transcription. The recruitment of these proteins is mediated by CTD phospho-epitopes generated during transcription. The mechanisms regulating the kinases that establish these phosphorylation patterns on the CTD are not known. We report that three CTD kinases, CDK7, CDK9, and BRD4, engage in cross-talk, modulating their subsequent CTD phosphorylation. BRD4 phosphorylates PTEFb/CDK9 at either Thr-29 or Thr-186, depending on its relative abundance, which represses or activates CDK9 CTD kinase activity, respectively. Conversely, CDK9 phosphorylates BRD4 enhancing its CTD kinase activity. The CTD Ser-5 kinase CDK7 also interacts with and phosphorylates BRD4, potently inhibiting BRD4 kinase activity. Additionally, the three kinases regulate each other indirectly through the general transcription factor TAF7. An inhibitor of CDK9 and CDK7 CTD kinase activities, TAF7 also binds to BRD4 and inhibits its kinase activity. Each of these kinases phosphorylates TAF7, affecting its subsequent ability to inhibit the other two. Thus, a complex regulatory network governs Pol II CTD kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1985466103,"CCN1 is a matricellular protein and a member of the CCN family of growth factors. CCN1 is associated with the development of various cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Our recent studies found that CCN1 plays a critical role in pancreatic carcinogenesis through the induction of EMT and stemness. CCN1 mRNA and protein were detected in the early precursor lesions, and their expression intensified with disease progression. However, biochemical activity and the molecular targets of CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells are unknown. Here we show that CCN1 regulates the Sonic Hedgehog (SHh) signaling pathway, which is associated with the PDAC progression and poor prognosis. SHh regulation by CCN1 in pancreatic cancer cells is mediated through the active Notch-1. Notably, active Notch-1is recruited by CCN1 in these cells via the inhibition of proteasomal degradation results in stabilization of the receptor. We find that CCN1-induced activation of SHh signaling might be necessary for CCN1-dependent in vitro pancreatic cancer cell migration and tumorigenicity of the side population of pancreatic cancer cells (cancer stem cells) in a xenograft in nude mice. Moreover, the functional role of CCN1 could be mediated through the interaction with the αvβ3 integrin receptor. These extensive studies propose that targeting CCN1 can provide a new treatment option for patients with pancreatic cancer since blocking CCN1 simultaneously blocks two critical pathways (i.e. SHh and Notch1) associated with the development of the disease as well as drug resistance.

Briefly, cloned human CCN1-shRNA/scrambled vector were transfected into an AmphopakTM293 packaging cell line using siPORTTM XP-1 transfection agent. After transfection, the culture medium was changed and cells were incubated 48 more hours prior to collection of viral particles. Approximately, 60% of cells were infected with CCN1-shRNA containing viral supernatant or scrambled control and incubated for 72 h. Stable transfected clones were selected by puromycin treatment until the uninfected cells died. Stable cells were then cultured in regular DMEM with 10% FBS and harvested for Western or Northern blot analysis to check the transfection efficiency. Cell lysates prepared from pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts containing 30–50 μg proteins were analyzed by Western blot using the appropriate antibodies according to the method described previously (34Banerjee S.

Cells were plated in chambered slides, fixed in methanol and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. After using a blocking solution, the cells were incubated with monoclonal mouse anti-SHh overnight at 4 °C and incubated with a goat anti-mouse FITC-conjugated Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody. Cells were washed with 1× PBS and mounted in PBS glycerin. Immunofluorescent-stained cells were visualized using a Nikon Eclipse TE-300 microscope, and images were analyzed by software. Cells incubated without the primary antibody were treated as negative controls. The motility behavior of the cells of different experimental conditions was examined by the scratch wound healing assay. Briefly, different cells were seeded in the chamber slides and allowed to reach 70–80% confluence as a monolayer and then scratched with a pipette tip diagonally. After scratching, chambers were gently washed with fresh media to remove detached cells. Migration into this area was documented and measured after 24 h. Each analysis was repeated three times. To determine the chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity, 20 S proteasome activity assay kit (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, harvested cells were incubated on ice for 30 min in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a protease inhibitor mixture including 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg of leupeptin, and 1.0 mm PMSF. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (18,000 × g, 1 h, 4 °C), and the supernatant was collected for the assay. For each reaction, 50 μg of sample proteins were used in assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 25 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2) where the chymotrypsin fluorogenic substrate N-succinyl-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Suc-LLVY-AMC) was added to each well at a concentration of 50 μm, and the plates were incubated for 1 h in the dark at 37 °C. The fluorescence of AMC due to proteasome-mediated cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate was measured by excitation at 360 nm and emission at 460 nm in a SynergyTM HT Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (BioTek Instruments, Winooski, VT). All experiments were performed in triplicate for each observation. Each of the data represent the mean ± S.E. from the three separate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed between the two groups of data by an unpaired Student's t test GraphPad Prism 4 software). Values were considered statistically significant at p < 0.05. To determine the status of SHh and CCN1 protein in different pancreatic cancer cell lines, we evaluated the level of SHh and CCN1 in different pancreatic cell lines (i.e. BxPC-3, Capan-1 (less aggressive), AsPC-1, Hs766T, Panc-1, and MIA-Paca-2 (highly aggressive) (7Haque I.

https://openalex.org/W1983914652,"Background The Suicide Trigger Scale (STS) was designed to measure the construct of an affective ‘suicide trigger state.’ This study aims to extend the inpatient setting validation study of the original Suicide Trigger Scale version 2 to the revised Suicide Trigger Scale version 3 (STS-3) in an acute psychiatric emergency room setting. Methods The 42-item STS-3 and a brief psychological test battery were administered to 183 adult psychiatric patients with suicidal ideation or attempt in the psychiatric emergency room, and re-administered to subjects at 1 year follow up. Factor analysis, linear and logistic regressions were used to examine construct structure, divergent and convergent validity, and construct validity, respectively. Results The STS-3 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.94). Factor analysis yielded a three-factor solution, which explained 43.4% of the variance. Principal axis factor analysis was used to identify three reliable subscales: Frantic Hopelessness, Ruminative Flooding, and Near-Psychotic Somatization (Cronbach’s alphas 0.90, 0.80, and 0.76, respectively). Significant positive associations were observed between Frantic Hopelessness and BSI depression and anxiety subscales, between Ruminative Flooding and BSI anxiety and paranoia subscales, and Near Psychotic Somatization and BSI somatization subscales. Suicidal subjects with suicide attempt history had mean scores 7 points higher than those without history of suicide attempts. Frantic hopelessness was a significant predictor of current suicide attempt when only attempts requiring at least some medical attention were considered. Conclusion The STS-3 measures a distinct clinical entity, provisionally termed the ‘suicide trigger state.’ Scores on the STS-3 or select subscales appear to relate to degree of suicidality in terms of severity of ideation, history of attempt, and presence of substantive current attempts. Further study is required to confirm the factor structure and better understand the nature of these relations."
https://openalex.org/W2019790208,"The Indian Ocean is the least known ocean in the world with the biogeography of marine species in the West Indian Ocean (WIO) understudied. The hydrography of WIO is characterized by four distinct oceanographic systems and there were few glacial refugia formations in the WIO during the Pleistocene. We used the widely distributed intertidal barnacle Tetraclita to test the hypothesis that the distribution and connectivity of intertidal animals in the WIO are determined by the major oceanographic regime but less influenced by historical events such as Pleistocene glaciations. Tetraclita were studied from 32 locations in the WIO. The diversity and distribution of Tetraclita species in the Indian Ocean were examined based on morphological examination and sequence divergence of two mitochondrial genes (12S rDNA and COI) and one nuclear gene (histone 3, H3). Divergence in DNA sequences revealed the presence of seven evolutionarily significant units (ESUs) of Tetraclita in WIO, with most of them recognized as valid species. The distribution of these ESUs is closely tied to the major oceanographic circulation systems. T. rufotincta is distributed in the Monsoonal Gyre. T. ehsani is present in the Gulf of Oman and NW India. Tetraclita sp. nov. is associated with the Hydrochemical Front at 10°S latitude. T. reni is confined to southern Madagascan and Mauritian waters, influenced by the West Wind Drift. The endemic T. achituvi is restricted to the Red Sea. Tetraclita serrata consists of two ESUs (based on mtDNA analysis) along the east to west coast of South Africa. The two ESUs could not be distinguished from morphological analysis and nuclear H3 sequences. Our results support that intertidal species in the West Indian Ocean are associated with each of the major oceanographic circulation systems which determine gene flow. Geographical distribution is, however, less influenced by the geological history of the region."
https://openalex.org/W2124929807,"Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is a non-receptor tyrosine kinase expressed in epithelial cancers. Disruption of Ptk6 decreases azoxymethane-induced colon tumorigenesis in mice by preventing signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 activation. Relocalization of PTK6 in prostate cancers contributes to increased growth. Although not expressed in normal breast or ovary, PTK6 promotes anchorage-independent survival of breast and ovarian tumor cells. We identified several potential PTK6 substrates in the human SW620 colon cancer cell line using mass spectrometry, including FAK (focal adhesion kinase). We show that FAK is a direct substrate of PTK6 in vitro and in vivo. Expression of membrane-targeted active PTK6 (Palm-PTK6-YF) induces constitutive activation of FAK and cell morphology changes, which are independent of SRC family kinases in Src-/-, Yes-/-, Fyn-/- (SYF) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Palm-PTK6-YF expressing SYF cells are transformed and overcome contact inhibition, form colonies in transformation assays, proliferate in suspension and form tumors in a xenograft model. Expression of FAK and Palm-PTK6-YF in Fak-/- MEFs synergistically activates AKT and protects cells against anoikis. However, expression of Palm-PTK6-YF in Akt1/2-/- MEFs fails to protect cells from anoikis, indicating AKT is critical in PTK6 and FAK-mediated survival signaling. In a conditional Pten knockout murine prostate cancer model, we identify prostate epithelial cells with enhanced activation of endogenous PTK6 and FAK at the plasma membrane. Knockdown of PTK6 in the PC3 human prostate cancer cell line disrupts FAK and AKT activation and promotes anoikis, which can be rescued by exogenous expression of FAK. Our data reveal important roles for a PTK6-FAK-AKT signaling axis in promoting anchorage-independent cell survival."
https://openalex.org/W1973619455,"Background Analysis of cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma is used routinely for non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) of fetal sex determination, fetal rhesus D status and some single gene disorders. True positive results rely on detection of the fetal target being analysed. No amplification of the target may be interpreted either as a true negative result or a false negative result due to the absence or very low levels of cffDNA. The hypermethylated RASSF1A promoter has been reported as a universal fetal marker to confirm the presence of cffDNA. Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes hypomethylated maternal sequences are digested leaving hypermethylated fetal sequences detectable. Complete digestion of maternal sequences is required to eliminate false positive results. Methods cfDNA was extracted from maternal plasma (n = 90) and digested with methylation-sensitive and insensitive restriction enzymes. Analysis of RASSF1A, SRY and DYS14 was performed by real-time PCR. Results Hypermethylated RASSF1A was amplified for 79 samples (88%) indicating the presence of cffDNA. SRY real time PCR results and fetal sex at delivery were 100% accurate. Eleven samples (12%) had no detectable hypermethylated RASSF1A and 10 of these (91%) had gestational ages less than 7 weeks 2 days. Six of these samples were male at delivery, five had inconclusive results for SRY analysis and one sample had no amplifiable SRY. Conclusion Use of this assay for the detection of hypermethylated RASSF1A as a universal fetal marker has the potential to improve the diagnostic reliability of NIPD for fetal sex determination and single gene disorders."

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) cleave SNARE proteins in motor neurons that inhibits synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis, resulting in flaccid paralysis. There are seven BoNT serotypes (A-G). In current models, BoNTs initially bind gangliosides on resting neurons and upon SV exocytosis associate with the luminal domains of SV-associated proteins as a second receptor. The entry of BoNT/C is less clear. Characterizing the heavy chain receptor binding domain (HCR), BoNT/C was shown to utilize gangliosides as dual host receptors. Crystallographic and biochemical studies showed that the two ganglioside binding sites, termed GBP2 and Sia-1, were independent and utilized unique mechanisms to bind complex gangliosides. The GBP2 binding site recognized gangliosides that contained a sia5 sialic acid, whereas the Sia-1 binding site recognized gangliosides that contained a sia7 sialic acid and sugars within the backbone of the ganglioside. Utilizing gangliosides that uniquely recognized the GBP2 and Sia-1 binding sites, HCR/C entry into Neuro-2A cells required both functional ganglioside binding sites. HCR/C entered cells differently than the HCR of tetanus toxin, which also utilizes dual gangliosides as host receptors. A point-mutated HCR/C that lacked GBP2 binding potential retained the ability to bind and enter Neuro-2A cells. This showed that ganglioside binding at the Sia-1 site was accessible on the plasma membrane, suggesting that SV exocytosis may not be required to expose BoNT/C receptors. These studies highlight the utility of BoNT HCRs as probes to study the role of gangliosides in neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W2012022718,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) plays an important role in regulating appetite and hunger in vertebrates. In the hypothalamus, NPY stimulates food intake under the control of the nutritional status. Previous studies have shown the presence of NPY and receptors in rodent olfactory system, and suggested a neuroproliferative role. Interestingly, NPY was also shown to directly modulate olfactory responses evoked by a food-related odorant in hungry axolotls. We have recently demonstrated that another nutritional cue, insulin, modulates the odorant responses of the rat olfactory mucosa (OM). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the potential effect of NPY on rat OM responses to odorants, in relation to the animal's nutritional state. We measured the potential NPY modulation of OM responses to odorant, using electro-olfactogram (EOG) recordings, in fed and fasted adult rats. NPY application significantly and transiently increased EOG amplitudes in fasted but not in fed rats. The effects of specific NPY-receptor agonists were similarly quantified, showing that NPY operated mainly through Y1 receptors. These receptors appeared as heterogeneously expressed by olfactory neurons in the OM, and western blot analysis showed that they were overexpressed in fasted rats. These data provide the first evidence that NPY modulates the initial events of odorant detection in the rat OM. Because this modulation depends on the nutritional status of the animal, and is ascribed to NPY, the most potent orexigenic peptide in the central nervous system, it evidences a strong supplementary physiological link between olfaction and nutritional processes."

Here, we show that the inactivation of MEN1 is associated with increased DNA methylation at the MEN1 promoter by K-Ras. On one hand, the activated K-Ras up-regulates the expression of DNA methyltransferases and enhances the binding of DNA methyltransferase 1 to the MEN1 promoter, leading to increased DNA methylation at the MEN1 gene in lung cancer cells; on the other hand, menin reduces the level of active Ras-GTP at least partly by preventing GRB2 and SOS1 from binding to Ras, without affecting the expression of GRB2 and SOS1. In human lung adenocarcinoma samples, we further demonstrate that reduced menin expression is associated with the enhanced expression of Ras (p < 0.05). Finally, excision of the Men1 gene markedly accelerates the K-RasG12D-induced tumor formation in the Men1f/f;K-RasG12D/+;Cre ER mouse model.

We discovered a reduced quantity of specific proteins in mitochondrial complexes in Yuetai A compared with Yuetai B, indicating a defect in mitochondrial complex assembly in the sterile line. Western blotting showed that ORFH79 protein and ATP1 protein, an F(1) sector component of complex V, are both associated with large protein complexes of similar size. Respiratory complex activity assays and transmission electron microscopy revealed functional and morphological defects in the mitochondria of Yuetai A when compared with Yuetai B.

https://openalex.org/W1965474007,"The apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii is regularly transmitted to humans via the ingestion of contaminated meat products from chronically infected livestock. This route of transmission requires intracellular development and long-term survival of the parasite within muscle tissue. In this study, we determined the cell-autonomous immunity of mature primary embryonic or C2C12 skeletal muscle cells (SkMCs) to infection with T. gondii. Non-activated SkMCs and control fibroblasts sustained parasite replication; however, interferon (IFN)-γ significantly inhibited parasite growth in SkMCs but not in fibroblasts. Intracellular parasite replication was diminished by IFN-γ whereas host cell invasion was not affected. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) did not further increase the IFN-γ-triggered host defense of SkMCs against Toxoplasma. Remarkably, IFN-γ alone or in combination with TNF decreased the high level of T. gondii bradyzoite formation being observed in non-activated SkMCs. Stimulation of SkMCs with IFN-γ strongly triggered expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcripts, and induced significantly higher levels of nitric oxide (NO) in SkMCs than in fibroblasts. Consequently, pharmacological inhibition of iNOS partially abrogated the IFN-γ-induced toxoplasmacidal activity of SkMCs. In addition, SkMCs strongly up-regulated immunity-regulated GTPases (IRGs) following stimulation with IFN-γ. IRGs accumulated on Toxoplasma-containing vacuoles in SkMCs in a parasite strain-dependent manner. Subsequent vacuole disruption and signs of degenerating parasites were regularly recognized in IFN-γ-treated SkMCs infected with type II parasites. Together, murine SkMCs exert potent toxoplasmacidal activity after stimulation with IFN-γ and have to be considered active participants in the local immune response against Toxoplasma in skeletal muscle."

Thioredoxins are ubiquitous proteins that catalyze thiol-disulfide redox reactions. They have a crucial role in the oxidative stress response as well as the redox regulation of metabolic enzymes. In cyanobacteria, little is known about the regulation of trx gene expression despite the importance of thioredoxins in cellular functions. In the present study, transcriptional regulation of the trx genes under oxidative stress conditions was investigated in the heterocystous cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120. When cells were exposed to H(2)O(2), only the trxA2 gene (all1866) of seven trx genes was induced. Disruption of the rexT gene (alr1867), encoding a transcriptional regulator of the ArsR family, resulted in increased expression of trxA2. RexT bound to the region downstream of the transcription initiation site of trxA2. The DNA binding activity of RexT was impaired by H(2)O(2) through the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bond, which induced expression of the trxA2 gene. The inactivated DNA binding activity of RexT was restored by reduced TrxA2. Hence, RexT is considered as a redox-sensing transcriptional repressor of trxA2. These results support the idea that the RexT-TrxA2 regulatory system is important for the oxidative stress response in this cyanobacterium."
https://openalex.org/W1970065473,"Very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD)-deficiency is the most common long-chain fatty acid oxidation disorder presenting with heterogeneous phenotypes. Similar to many patients with VLCADD, VLCAD-deficient mice (VLCAD−/−) remain asymptomatic over a long period of time. In order to identify the involved compensatory mechanisms, wild-type and VLCAD−/− mice were fed one year either with a normal diet or with a diet in which medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) replaced long-chain triglycerides, as approved intervention in VLCADD. The expression of the mitochondrial long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) and medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) was quantified at mRNA and protein level in heart, liver and skeletal muscle. The oxidation capacity of the different tissues was measured by LC-MS/MS using acyl-CoA substrates with a chain length of 8 to 20 carbons. Moreover, in white skeletal muscle the role of glycolysis and concomitant muscle fibre adaptation was investigated. In one year old VLCAD−/− mice MCAD and LCAD play an important role in order to compensate deficiency of VLCAD especially in the heart and in the liver. However, the white gastrocnemius muscle develops alternative compensatory mechanism based on a different substrate selection and increased glucose oxidation. Finally, the application of an MCT diet over one year has no effects on LCAD or MCAD expression. MCT results in the VLCAD−/− mice only in a very modest improvement of medium-chain acyl-CoA oxidation capacity restricted to cardiac tissue. In conclusion, VLCAD−/− mice develop tissue-specific strategies to compensate deficiency of VLCAD either by induction of other mitochondrial acyl-CoA dehydrogenases or by enhancement of glucose oxidation. In the muscle, there is evidence of a muscle fibre type adaptation with a predominance of glycolytic muscle fibres. Dietary modification as represented by an MCT-diet does not improve these strategies long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2057961356,"Tumor-suppressor protein p53, the ‘guardian of the genome’, is critical in maintaining cellular homeostasis and genomic stability. Earlier, we have reported the discovery of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) within the p53 mRNA that regulate the translation of the full length and its N-terminal-truncated isoform, ΔN-p53. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) is an IRES trans-acting factor that positively regulates the IRES activities of both p53 isoforms by relocating from nucleus to the cytoplasm during stress conditions. Here we have demonstrated the putative contact points of PTB on the p53 IRES RNA. Studies on mutations that occur naturally in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) in p53 mRNA were lacking. We have investigated a naturally occurring C-to-T single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) first reported in human melanoma tumors. This SNP is at position 119 in the 5′ UTR of p53 mRNA and we demonstrate that it has consequences on the translational control of p53. Introduction of this SNP has led to decrease in cap-independent translation from p53 5′ UTR in bicistronic reporter assay. Further, the effects of this SNP on cap-independent translation have been studied in the context of p53 cDNA as well. Interestingly, the 5′ UTR with this SNP has shown reduced binding to PTB that can be corroborated to its weaker IRES activity. Previously, it has been shown that G2–M checkpoint, DNA-damaging stress and oncogenic insult favor IRES-mediated translation. Under similar conditions, we demonstrate that this SNP interferes with the enhancement of the IRES activity of the 5′ UTR. Taken together, the results demonstrate for the first time that SNP in the 5′ UTR of the p53 mRNA might have a role in translational control of this critical tumor-suppressor gene."
https://openalex.org/W2093425365,"The Streptomyces phage phiC31 integrase was tested for its feasibility in excising transgenes from the barley genome through site-specific recombination. We produced transgenic barley plants expressing an active phiC31 integrase and crossed them with transgenic barley plants carrying a target locus for recombination. The target sequence involves a reporter gene encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is flanked by the attB and attP recognition sites for the phiC31 integrase. This sequence disruptively separates a gusA coding sequence from an upstream rice actin promoter. We succeeded in producing site-specific recombination events in the hybrid progeny of 11 independent barley plants carrying the above target sequence after crossing with plants carrying a phiC31 expression cassette. Some of the hybrids displayed fully executed recombination. Excision of the GFP gene fostered activation of the gusA gene, as visualized in tissue of hybrid plants by histochemical staining. The recombinant loci were detected in progeny of selfed F1, even in individuals lacking the phiC31 transgene, which provides evidence of stability and generative transmission of the recombination events. In several plants that displayed incomplete recombination, extrachromosomal excision circles were identified. Besides the technical advance achieved in this study, the generated phiC31 integrase-expressing barley plants provide foundational stock material for use in future approaches to barley genetic improvement, such as the production of marker-free transgenic plants or switching transgene activity."
https://openalex.org/W1990955067,"Contemporary theories of motor control propose that motor planning involves the prediction of the consequences of actions. These predictions include the associated costs as well as the rewarding nature of movements' outcomes. Within the estimation of these costs and rewards would lie the valence, that is, the pleasantness or unpleasantness of a given stimulus with which one is about to interact. The aim of this study was to test if motor preparation encompasses valence.The readiness potential, an electrophysiological marker of motor preparation, was recorded before the grasping of pleasant, neutral and unpleasant stimuli. Items used were balanced in weight and placed inside transparent cylinders to prompt a similar grip among trials. Compared with neutral stimuli, the grasping of pleasant stimuli was preceded by a readiness potential of lower amplitude, whereas that of unpleasant stimuli was associated with a readiness potential of higher amplitude.We show for the first time that the sensorimotor cortex activity preceding the grasping of a stimulus is affected by its valence. Smaller readiness potential amplitudes found for pleasant stimuli could imply in the recruitment of pre-set motor repertoires, whereas higher amplitudes found for unpleasant stimuli would emerge from a discrepancy between the required action and their aversiveness. Our results indicate that the prediction of action outcomes encompasses an estimate of the valence of a stimulus with which one is about to interact."
https://openalex.org/W1967222758,"In the adult hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG), newly born neurons are functionally integrated into existing circuits and play important roles in hippocampus-dependent memory. However, it remains unclear how neural plasticity regulates the integration pattern of new neurons into preexisting circuits. Because dendritic spines are major postsynaptic sites for excitatory inputs, spines of new neurons were visualized by retrovirus-mediated labeling to evaluate integration. Long-term potentiation (LTP) was induced at 12, 16, or 21 days postinfection (dpi), at which time new neurons have no, few, or many spines, respectively. The spine expression patterns were investigated at one or two weeks after LTP induction. Induction at 12 dpi increased later spinogenesis, although the new neurons at 12 dpi didn't respond to the stimulus for LTP induction. Induction at 21 dpi transiently mediated spine enlargement. Surprisingly, LTP induction at 16 dpi reduced the spine density of new neurons. All LTP-mediated changes specifically appeared within the LTP-induced layer. Therefore, neural plasticity differentially regulates the integration of new neurons into the activated circuit, dependent on their developmental stage. Consequently, new neurons at different developmental stages may play distinct roles in processing the acquired information by modulating the connectivity of activated circuits via their integration."
https://openalex.org/W2008669974,"A number of secreted cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), are attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. We have determined the solution structure of mouse IL-6 to assess the functional significance of apparent differences in the receptor interaction sites (IL-6Rα and gp130) suggested by the fairly low degree of sequence similarity with human IL-6. Structure-based sequence alignment of mouse IL-6 and human IL-6 revealed surprising differences in the conservation of the two distinct gp130 binding sites (IIa and IIIa), which suggests a primacy for site III-mediated interactions in driving initial assembly of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 ternary complex. This is further supported by a series of direct binding experiments, which clearly demonstrate a high affinity IL-6/IL-6Rα-gp130 interaction via site III but only weak binding via site II. Collectively, our findings suggest a pathway for the evolution of the hexameric, IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex and strategies for therapeutic targeting. We propose that the signaling complex originally involved specific interactions between IL-6 and IL-6Rα (site I) and between the D1 domain of gp130 and IL-6/IL-6Rα (site III), with the later inclusion of interactions between the D2 and D3 domains of gp130 and IL-6/IL-6Rα (site II) through serendipity. It seems likely that IL-6 signaling benefited from the evolution of a multipurpose, nonspecific protein interaction surface on gp130, now known as the cytokine binding homology region (site II contact surface), which fortuitously contributes to stabilization of the IL-6/IL-6Rα/gp130 signaling complex.

https://openalex.org/W2035296990,"The hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein is a multifunctional protein that can interfere with the induction of an immune response. It has been reported that the HCV core protein inhibits HBV replication in vitro. In this study, we test the effect of the HCV core gene on the priming of the immune response to hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and on the replication of HBV in vivo. Our results showed that the full-length HCV core gene inhibits the induction of an immune response to the heterogeneous antigen, HBsAg, at the site of inoculation when HCV core (pC191) and HBsAg (pHBsAg) expression plasmids are co-administered as DNA vaccines into BALB/c mice. The observed interference effect of the HCV core occurs in the priming stage and is limited to the DNA form of the HBsAg antigen, but not to the protein form. The HCV core reduces the protective effect of the HBsAg when the HBsAg and the HCV core are co-administered as vaccines in an HBV hydrodynamic mouse model because the HCV core induces immune tolerance to the heterogeneous HBsAg DNA antigen. These results suggest that HCV core may play an important role in viral persistence by the attenuation of host immune responses to different antigens. We further tested whether the HCV core interfered with the priming of the immune response in hepatocytes via the hydrodynamic co-injection of an HBV replication-competent plasmid and an HCV core plasmid. The HCV core inhibited HBV replication and antigen expression in both BALB/c (H-2d) and C57BL/6 (H-2b) mice, the mouse models of acute and chronic hepatitis B virus infections. Thus, the HCV core inhibits the induction of a specific immune response to an HBsAg DNA vaccine. However, HCV C also interferes with HBV gene expression and replication in vivo, as observed in patients with coinfection."
https://openalex.org/W2006324726,"Aberrant motility and invasive ability are relevant hallmarks of malignant tumor cells. Pathways regulating the movement of cancer cells from the site of primary tumor toward adjacent and/or distant tissues are not entirely defined. By using a model of malignant transformation induced by Ras, we identified Wnt4 as an early target of Ras oncogenic signaling. Here we show that Wnt4 is repressed by Ras and that forced Wnt4 expression inhibits Ras-induced cell motility. Accordingly, we found that Wnt4 is downregulated in human anaplastic thyroid carcinomas, the most malignant and metastatic thyroid cancer histotype. Wnt4 interferes with Ras-induced actin cytoskeleton reorganization through non-canonical pathways, by altering the balance between the activation of different Rho-family small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). Finally, we demonstrate that Wnt4 is post-transcriptionally repressed by miR-24, a Ras-induced micro RNA (miRNA) targeting the 3′-untranslated region (UTR) of Wnt4. Taken together our data highlight a novel Ras-regulated miRNA-dependent circuitry regulating the motile phenotype of cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2039078486,"Cell-derived microparticles participate in intercellular communication similar to the classical messenger systems of small and macro-molecules that bind to specialized membrane receptors. Microparticles have been implicated in the regulation of a variety of complex physiopathologic processes, such as thrombosis, the control of innate and adaptive immunity, and cancer. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) is a Gq-coupled receptor present on the membrane of a variety of tissues, including neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system, immune cells, endocrine and exocrine glands, and smooth muscle. The endogenous agonist of NK1R is the undecapeptide substance P (SP). We have previously described intracellular signaling mechanisms that regulate NK1R-mediated rapid cell shape changes in HEK293 cells and U373MG cells. In the present study, we show that the activation of NK1R in HEK293 cells, but not in U373MG cells, leads to formation of sheer-stress induced microparticles that stain positive with the membrane-selective fluorescent dye FM 2-10. SP-induced microparticle formation is independent of elevated intracellular calcium concentrations and activation of NK1R present on HEK293-derived microparticles triggers detectable calcium increase in SP-induced microparticles. The ROCK inhibitor Y27632 and the dynamin inhibitor dynasore inhibited membrane blebbing and microparticle formation in HEK293 cells, strongly suggesting that microparticle formation in this cell type is dependent on membrane blebbing."
https://openalex.org/W2071370058,"Tumor cells rely upon membrane pliancy to escape primary lesions and invade secondary metastatic sites. This process relies upon localized assembly and disassembly cycles of F-actin that support and underlie the plasma membrane. Dynamic actin generates both spear-like and bleb structures respectively characterizing mesenchymal and amoeboid motility programs utilized by metastatic cells in three-dimensional matrices. The molecular mechanism and physiological trigger(s) driving membrane plasticity are poorly understood. mDia formins are F-actin assembly factors directing membrane pliancy in motile cells. mDia2 is functionally coupled with its binding partner DIP, regulating cortical actin and inducing membrane blebbing in amoeboid cells. Here we show that mDia2 and DIP co-tether to nascent blebs and this linkage is required for bleb formation. DIP controls mesenchymal/amoeboid cell interconvertability, while CXCL12 induces assembly of mDia2:DIP complexes to bleb cortices in 3D matrices. These results demonstrate how DIP-directed mDia2-dependent F-actin dynamics regulate morphological plasticity in motile cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2000007623,"The response regulator RpaA was examined by targeted mutagenesis under high light conditions in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. A significant reduction in chlorophyll fluorescence from photosystem I at 77 K was observed in the RpaA mutant cells under high light conditions. Interestingly, the chlorophyll fluorescence emission from the photosystem I trimers at 77 K are similar to that of the wild type, while the chlorophyll fluorescence from the photosystem I monomers was at a much lower level in the mutant than in the wild type under high light conditions. The RpaA inactivation resulted in a dramatic reduction in the monomeric photosystem I and the D1 protein but not the CP47 content. However, there is no significant difference in the transcript levels of psaA or psbA or other genes examined, most of which are involved in photosynthesis, pigment biosynthesis, or stress responses. Under high light conditions, the growth of the mutant was affected, and both the chlorophyll content and the whole-chain oxygen evolution capability of the mutant were found to be significantly lower than those of the wild type, respectively. We propose that RpaA regulates the accumulation of the monomeric photosystem I and the D1 protein under high light conditions. This is the first report demonstrating that inactivation of a stress response regulator has specifically reduced the monomeric photosystem I. It suggests that PS I monomers and PS I trimers can be regulated independently for acclimation of cells to high light stress."
https://openalex.org/W2127806277,"Drosophila PR-Set7 or SET8 is a histone methyltransferase that specifically monomethylates histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20). L(3)MBT has been identified as a reader of methylated H4K20. It contains several conserved domains including three MBT repeats binding mono- and dimethylated H4K20 peptides. We find that the depletion of PR-Set7 blocks de novo H4K20me1 resulting in the immediate activation of the DNA damage checkpoint, an increase in the size of interphase nuclei, and drastic reduction of cell viability. L(3)mbt on the other hand stabilizes the monomethyl mark, as L(3)mbt-depleted S2 cells show a reduction of more than 60% of bulk monomethylated H4K20 (H4K20me1) while viability is barely affected. Ploidy and basic chromatin structure show only small changes in PR-Set7-depleted cells, but higher order interphase chromatin organization is significantly affected presumably resulting in the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. In the absence of any other known functions of PR-Set7, the setting of the de novo monomethyl mark appears essential for cell viability in the presence or absence of the DNA damage checkpoint, but once newly assembled chromatin is established the monomethyl mark, protected by L(3)mbt, is dispensable."
https://openalex.org/W1977072953,"Mcl-1 is an anti-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family that plays a key role in normal development, but also in pathologies such as cancer. It has some unusual properties compared to other anti-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family, and its expression and function are dynamically regulated by a variety of post-transcriptional and post-translational processes. Of note, Mcl-1 protein has a very short half life, and its stability and function may be regulated by reversible phosphorylation. There is also evidence to suggest that it may be localized to different subcellular compartments. The aim of this work was to determine whether residues within the PEST region of Mcl-1 that may undergo reversible phosphorylation, also regulate its subcellular distribution. We show that EGFP:Mcl-1 localizes mainly to the mitochondria of HeLa cells, with some additional cytoplasmic and nuclear localization. The mutations, S64A, S64E, S121A, S159A, T163A and T163E did not significantly affect the localization of Mcl-1. However, mutation of Ser162 to the phospho-null residue, Alanine resulted in an essentially nuclear localization, with some cytoplasmic but no mitochondrial localization. This mutant Mcl-1 protein, S162A, showed significantly decreased stability and it decreased the ability to protect against Bak-induced apoptosis. These data identify a new molecular determinant of Mcl-1 function, localization and stability that may be important for understanding the role of this protein in disease."

The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to assess if IP-10 measurements from dried plasma spots (DPS) are accurate in HCV-infected patients with either minimal or significant fibrosis. We measured IP-10 levels in plasma and DPS of 21 HCV-infected patients with cirrhosis and 19 patients with no/little fibrosis (determined with FibroScan). Cirrhotic patients had significantly higher levels of IP-10 compared to patients with minimal fibrosis. DPS and plasma measurements of IP-10 are comparable and the correlation was excellent (r(2) = 0.97, p<0.0001). The DPS based method for IP-10 detection performs well in HCV-infected patients with either minimal or significant fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W1985510372,"Inhibition of angiogenesis is a promising addition to current cancer treatment strategies. Neutralization of vascular endothelial growth factor by monoclonal antibodies is clinically effective but may cause side effects due to thrombosis. Low molecular weight angiogenesis inhibitors are currently less effective than antibody treatment and are also associated with serious side effects. The discovery of new chemotypes with efficient antiangiogenic activity is therefore of pertinent interest. (S)-Levamisole hydrochloride, an anthelminthic drug approved for human use and with a known clinical profile, was recently shown to be an inhibitor of angiogenesis in vitro and exhibited tumor growth inhibition in mice. Here we describe the synthesis and in vitro evaluation of a series of N-alkylated analogues of levamisole with the aim of characterizing structure–activity relationships with regard to inhibition of angiogenesis. N-Methyllevamisole and p-bromolevamisole proved more effective than the parent compound, (S)-levamisole hydrochloride, with respect to inhibition of angiogenesis and induction of undifferentiated cluster morphology in human umbilical vein endothelial cells grown in co-culture with normal human dermal fibroblasts. Interestingly, the cluster morphology caused by N-methyllevamisole was different than the clusters observed for levamisole, and a third “cord-like” morphology resembling that of the known drug suramin was observed for an aniline-containing derivative. New chemotypes exhibiting antiangiogenic effects in vitro are thus described, and further investigation of their underlying mechanism of action is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W1994599543,"Inteins catalyze a protein splicing reaction to excise the intein from a precursor protein and join the flanking sequences (exteins) with a peptide bond. In a split intein, the intein fragments (I(N) and I(C)) can reassemble non-covalently to catalyze a trans-splicing reaction that joins the exteins from separate polypeptides. An atypical split intein having a very small I(N) and a large I(C) is particularly useful for joining synthetic peptides with recombinant proteins, which can be a generally useful method of introducing site-specific chemical labeling or modifications into proteins. However, a large I(C) derived from an Ssp DnaX intein was found recently to undergo spontaneous C-cleavage, which raised questions regarding its structure-function and ability to trans-splice. Here, we show that this I(C) could undergo trans-splicing in the presence of I(N), and the trans-splicing activity completely suppressed the C-cleavage activity. We also found that this I(C) could trans-splice with small I(N) sequences derived from two other inteins, showing a cross-reactivity of this atypical split intein. Furthermore, we found that this I(C) could trans-splice even when the I(N) sequence was embedded in a nearly complete intein sequence, suggesting that the small I(N) could project out of the central pocket of the intein to become accessible to the I(C). Overall, these findings uncovered a new atypical split intein that can be valuable for peptide-protein trans-splicing, and they also revealed an interesting structural flexibility and cross-reactivity at the active site of this intein."
https://openalex.org/W1998638066,"Crystal proteins synthesized by Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) have been used as biopesticides because of their toxicity to the insect larval hosts. To protect the proteins from environmental stress to extend their activity, we have developed a new microcapsule formulation. Poly (acrylic acid) (PAH) and poly (styrene sulfonate) (PSS) were fabricated through layer-by-layer self-assembly based on a CaCO(3) core. Cry1Ac protoxins were loaded into microcapsules through layer-by-layer self-assembly at low pH, and the encapsulated product was stored in water at 4°C. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to observe the morphology of the capsules. To confirm the successful encapsulation, the loading results were observed with a confocal laser scattering microscope (CLSM), using fluorescein-labeled Cry1Ac protoxin (FITC-Cry1Ac). The protoxins were released from the capsule under the alkaline condition corresponding to the midgut of certain insects, a condition which seldom exists elsewhere in the environment. The following bioassay experiment demonstrated that the microcapsules with Cry1Ac protoxins displayed approximately equivalent insecticidal activity to the Asian corn borer compared with free Cry1Ac protoxins, and empty capsules proved to have no effect on insects. Further result also indicated that the formulation could keep stable under the condition of heat and desiccation. These results suggest that this formulation provides a promising methodology that protects protoxins from the environment and releases them specifically in the target insects' midgut, which has shown potential as biopesticide in the field."

Disruption of CNB myristoylation by mutation of the myristoylated glycine triggered constitutive expression of a calcineurin-dependent reporter gene and enhanced calcineurin-dependent phenotypes. Basal phosphatase activity was also increased in nmt1-181 yeast with reduced N-myristoyltransferase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2014150511,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is characterized by renal fibrosis that can lead to end-stage renal failure, and studies have supported a strong genetic influence on the risk of developing CKD. However, investigations of the underlying molecular mechanisms are hampered by the lack of suitable hereditary models in animals. We therefore sought to establish hereditary mouse models for CKD and renal fibrosis by investigating mice treated with the chemical mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea, and identified a mouse with autosomal recessive renal failure, designated RENF. Three-week old RENF mice were smaller than their littermates, whereas at birth they had been of similar size. RENF mice, at 4-weeks of age, had elevated concentrations of plasma urea and creatinine, indicating renal failure, which was associated with small and irregularly shaped kidneys. Genetic studies using DNA from 10 affected mice and 91 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped the Renf locus to a 5.8 Mbp region on chromosome 17E1.3. DNA sequencing of the xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh) gene revealed a nonsense mutation at codon 26 that co-segregated with affected RENF mice. The Xdh mutation resulted in loss of hepatic XDH and renal Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. XDH mutations in man cause xanthinuria with undetectable plasma uric acid levels and three RENF mice had plasma uric acid levels below the limit of detection. Histological analysis of RENF kidney sections revealed abnormal arrangement of glomeruli, intratubular casts, cellular infiltration in the interstitial space, and interstitial fibrosis. TUNEL analysis of RENF kidney sections showed extensive apoptosis predominantly affecting the tubules. Thus, we have established a mouse model for autosomal recessive early-onset renal failure due to a nonsense mutation in Xdh that is a model for xanthinuria in man. This mouse model could help to increase our understanding of the molecular mechanisms associated with renal fibrosis and the specific roles of XDH and uric acid."
https://openalex.org/W2080622861,"Magnetoencephalography (MEG), a non-invasive technique for characterizing brain electrical activity, is gaining popularity as a tool for assessing group-level differences between experimental conditions. One method for assessing task-condition effects involves beamforming, where a weighted sum of field measurements is used to tune activity on a voxel-by-voxel basis. However, this method has been shown to produce inhomogeneous smoothness differences as a function of signal-to-noise across a volumetric image, which can then produce false positives at the group level. Here we describe a novel method for group-level analysis with MEG beamformer images that utilizes the peak locations within each participant’s volumetric image to assess group-level effects. We compared our peak-clustering algorithm with SnPM using simulated data. We found that our method was immune to artefactual group effects that can arise as a result of inhomogeneous smoothness differences across a volumetric image. We also used our peak-clustering algorithm on experimental data and found that regions were identified that corresponded with task-related regions identified in the literature. These findings suggest that our technique is a robust method for group-level analysis with MEG beamformer images."
