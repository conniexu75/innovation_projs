Measurements performed in situ on individual custom-engineered nanotubes inside a high-resolution transmission electron microscope demonstrated the anticipated van der Waals energy–based retraction force and enabled us to place quantitative limits on the static and dynamic interwall frictional forces between nested nanotubes. Repeated extension and retraction of telescoping nanotube segments revealed no wear or fatigue on the atomic scale. Hence, these nanotubes may constitute near perfect, wear-free surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1992994268,An artificial crystal structure has been fabricated exhibiting a full three-dimensional photonic bandgap effect at optical communication wavelengths. The photonic crystal was constructed by stacking 0.7-micrometer period semiconductor stripes with the accuracy of 30 nanometers by advanced wafer-fusion technique. A bandgap effect of more than 40 decibels (which corresponds to 99.99% reflection) was successfully achieved. The result encourages us to create an ultra-small optical integrated circuit including a three-dimensional photonic crystal waveguide with a sharp bend.
https://openalex.org/W1989726653,"The fate of stem cells in plant meristems is governed by directional signaling systems that are regulated by negative feedback. In Arabidopsis thaliana , the CLAVATA ( CLV ) genes encode the essential components of a negative, stem cell–restricting pathway. We used transgenic plants overexpressing CLV3 to show that meristem cell accumulation and fate depends directly on the level of CLV3 activity and that CLV3 signaling occurs exclusively through a CLV1/CLV2 receptor kinase complex. We also demonstrate that the CLV pathway acts by repressing the activity of the transcription factor WUSCHEL , an element of the positive, stem cell–promoting pathway."

It has been assumed that bicarbonate mediates its effects through changes in intracellular pH or membrane potential; however, we demonstrate here that bicarbonate directly stimulates mammalian soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) activity in vivo and in vitro in a pH-independent manner. sAC is most similar to adenylyl cyclases from cyanobacteria, and bicarbonate regulation of cyclase activity is conserved in these early forms of life. sAC is also expressed in other bicarbonate-responsive tissues, which suggests that bicarbonate regulation of cAMP signaling plays a fundamental role in many biological systems."
https://openalex.org/W2113240860,"Suspended gold nanowires were made in an ultra-high vacuum. The finest of them was 0.6 nanometer in diameter and 6 nanometers in length. By high-resolution electron microscopy, they were shown to have a multi-shell structure composed of coaxial tubes. Each tube consists of helical atom rows coiled round the wire axis. The difference between the numbers of atom rows in outer and inner shells is seven, resulting in magic shell-closing numbers."
https://openalex.org/W1517181973,"With the discovery of missense mutations (A53T and A30P) in α-synuclein (α-Syn) in several families with early onset familial Parkinson's disease, α-Syn aggregation and fibril formation have been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of α-synucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. As previous reports have suggested that α-Syn plays a role in lipid transport and synaptic membrane biogenesis, we investigated whether α-Syn binds to a specific lipid ligand using thin layer chromatography overlay and examined the changes in its secondary structure using circular dichroism spectroscopy. α-Syn was found to bind to acidic phospholipid vesicles and this binding was significantly augmented by the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine, a neutral phospholipid. We further examined the interaction of α-Syn with lipids by in situ atomic force microscopy. The association of soluble wild-type α-Syn with planar lipid bilayers resulted in extensive bilayer disruption and the formation of amorphous aggregates and small fibrils. The A53T mutant α-Syn disrupted the lipid bilayers in a similar fashion but at a slower rate. These results suggest that α-Syn membrane interactions are physiologically important and the lipid composition of the cellular membranes may affect these interactions in vivo.

Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 249-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). α-Syn is expressed at high levels in the brain and enriched in neural synaptic terminals but its physiological function remains largely unknown. It has been suggested that α-Syn plays a role in neuronal plasticity because its expression in songbirds increased during learning (6George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). A role in neuronal development and in synaptogenesis has been proposed since α-Syn appears early in murine brain development and is redistributed from the cytosol to the nerve terminals where synaptosomes are located (8Thal L.J. Saitoh T. Masliah E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 338-344PubMed Google Scholar). The association of α-Syn with neurodegeneration was identified by initial alanine to threonine mutation at codon 53 (A53T) which was linked to an autosomal dominant, early-onset familial Parkinson's disease (PD) (9Polymeropoulos M.H. Lavedan C. Leroy E. Ide S.E. Dehejia A. Dutra A. Pike B. Root H. Rubenstein J. Boyer R. Stenroos E.S. Chandrasekharappa S. Athanassiadou A. Papapetropoulos T. Johnson W.G. Lazzarini A.M.

Kosel S. Przuntek H. Epplen J.T. Schols L. Riess O. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 106-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (3344) Google Scholar) suggesting that the protein is of etiological significance. In addition, the integral α-Syn fragment, called non-Aβ component, was found to be one of the major components of the insoluble fibrillar core of the Alzheimer's disease senile plaques (4Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 12Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Masliah E. Saitoh T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10139-10145Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). More recently, α-Syn has been shown to be one of the principal components of Lewy bodies that are intracellular inclusions with fibrillar morphology and are the neuropathological characteristics of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (13Spillantini M.G.

Brain Res. 1998; 808: 93-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemistry has revealed that α-Syn-positive inclusions are present in astrocytic and oligodendroglial cells of PD-afflicted individuals (20Wakabayashi K. Hayashi S. Yoshimoto M. Kudo H. Takahashi H. Acta Neuropathol. (Berl. ). 2000; 99: 14-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar, 21Arai T. Ueda K. Ikeda K. Akiyama H. Haga C. Kondo H. Kuroki N. Niizato K. Iritani S. Tsuchiya K. Neurosci. Lett. 1999; 259: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). α-Syn is also a major component of the glial and neuronal inclusions of multiple system atrophy (22Spillantini M.G.

Acta Neuropathol. (Berl .). 1998; 96: 439-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, α-Syn and its abnormal protein aggregation have been thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of these neurodegenerative diseases known as α-synucleinopathies (26Goedert M. Spillantini M.G. Mol. Psychiatry. 1998; 3: 462-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 27Takeda A. Mallory M. Sundsmo M. Honer W. Hansen L. Masliah E. Am. J.

In order to understand their etiology and pathogenesis, it is crucial to identify the normal function of α-Syn. The function of a protein is closely correlated with its three-dimensional structure, especially for proteins important in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases (29Borden K.L. Ann. Neurol. 1998; 44: S65-S71Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From a protein folding viewpoint, α-Syn is a dynamic molecule whose secondary structure depends on its environment. For example, it has an unfolded random coil structure in aqueous solution (30Weinreb P.H. Zhen W. Poon A.W. Conway K.A. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13709-13715Crossref PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar), forms α-helical structure upon binding to acidic phospholipid vesicles (31Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), and forms insoluble fibrils with a high β-sheet content that resemble the filaments found in Lewy bodies (32Giasson B.I. Uryu K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7619-7622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). The human α-Syn primary sequence (total 140 residues) is well conserved among vertebrates, with rodent and zebra finch α-Syn being 95 and 87% identical to the human sequence (1Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar, 6George J.M. Jin H. Woods W.S. Clayton D.F. Neuron. 1995; 15: 361-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar, 33Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal sequence (residues 7–87) contains a series of amphipathic α-helical domains that may facilitate either membrane-protein or protein-protein interactions (Fig.1). This region is composed of seven imperfect repeats of 11 amino acids, which contain a 6-residue core with the consensus sequence KTKEGV (Fig. 1 B; Ref. 33Goedert M. Nature. 1997; 388: 232-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The central region of α-Syn (residues 61–95) is very hydrophobic, and this internal fragment was initially isolated from Alzheimer's disease senile plaques (4Ueda K. Fukushima H. Masliah E. Xia Y. Iwai A. Yoshimoto M. Otero D.A. Kondo J. Ihara Y. Saitoh T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11282-11286Crossref PubMed Scopus (1239) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal region is rich in glutamate residues and thus quite acidic. These primary and secondary structure features of α-Syn support a role for its interaction with lipid membranes. There are a few lines of evidence suggesting that α-Syn may play a role in lipid transport and synaptic membrane biogenesis. First of all, its amphipathic α-helical domains of 11-residue repeats are reminiscent of those in the class A2 apolipoproteins, which carry lipid molecules by reversibly binding to them (34Epand R.M. The Amphipathic Helix. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1993Google Scholar). We and others have found that α-Syn undergoes a major structural transition from random coil to α-helical structure upon binding to lipid vesicles (31Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar), supporting the possible role of α-Syn in lipid binding and transport. Interestingly, one of the PD-linked point mutations (A30P) abolished the ability of α-Syn to bind to the lipid vesicles (35Jensen P.H. Nielsen M.S. Jakes R. Dotti C.G. Goedert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26292-26294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar), emphasizing the possibility that lipid binding is a normal function of α-Syn. Second, α- and β-synucleins were shown to be highly specific inhibitors of phospholipase D2 which hydrolyzes phosphatidylcholine to produce phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol (36Jenco J.M. Rawlingson A. Daniels B. Morris A.J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4901-4909Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). This suggests that the level and modification of α-Syn may affect phospholipase D2 activity, thereby modulating the cleavage of membrane lipids and membrane biogenesis (37Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 58: 120-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Third, α-Syn has been reported to co-localize with synaptic vesicles, suggesting its association with lipids (1Maroteaux L. Campanelli J.T. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2804-2815Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Iwai A. Masliah E. Yoshimoto M. Ge N. Flanagan L. de Silva H.A. Kittel A. Saitoh T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 467-475Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar, 39Irizarry M.C. Kim T.W. McNamara M. Tanzi R.E. George J.M. Clayton D.F. Hyman B.T. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1996; 55: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 40Withers G.S. George J.M. Banker G.A. Clayton D.F. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1997; 99: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Finally, it was recently reported that α-Syn regulates the size of the presynaptic vesicular pools (41Murphy D.D. Rueter S.M. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M.Y. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 3214-3220Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, when the expression of α-Syn was suppressed with antisense oligonucleotide in primary hippocampal neuronal cultures, the number of synaptic vesicles was reduced significantly. This also suggests a role of α-Syn in synaptic membrane biogenesis and/or vesicle fusion and budding. Given the evidence for α-Syn involvement in lipid transport and turnover in synaptic terminals, we investigated the possibility of a specific lipid ligand for α-Syn using thin layer chromatography (TLC) overlay and subsequent effect on secondary structure with circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. α-Syn was found to bind to acidic phospholipid vesicles and this binding was significantly augmented by the presence of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), a neutral phospholipid. The interaction of α-Syn with lipids was further examined usingin situ tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). The association of soluble wild-type α-Syn with planar lipid bilayers resulted in extensive bilayer disruption with the concomitant formation of amorphous aggregates and small fibrils. Finally, we compared the wild-type and mutant (A53T) α-Syn with regard to their comparative ability to interact with membranes. These in vitro studies are aimed at elucidating the physiological role of α-Syn in the normal brain as well as the pathological role of the mutant α-Syn in PD and related neurodegenerative diseases. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (POPS), brainl-α-phosphatidylserine (PS), brainl-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lyso brain plasmalogen phosphatidylethanolamine (lyso-PE), liverl-α-phosphatidylinositol (PI), brain sphingomyelin (sphingomyelin), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidic acid (POPA), and cholesterol were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Poly(isobutyl methacrylate) was obtained from Aldrich. Monoclonal mouse anti-α-synuclein antibody (Synuclein-1) was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was from Bio-Rad. Foil-backed polygram silica gel G thin layer chromatography plates were from Macherey-Nagel (Germany). Human α-Syn cDNAs, both wild-type and a mutant (A53T), were subcloned into the plasmid pET-28a (Novagen), usingNcoI and HindIII restriction sites. α-Syn was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) via an isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible T7 promoter. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The bacterial suspension was then sonicated for 30 s several times, boiled for 15 min, and ultracentrifuged at 150,000 ×g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the heat-stable α-Syn was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris, pH 8.3, loaded onto a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and eluted with a 0–500 mm NaCl step gradient. The eluents were desalted and concentrated on a Centricon-10 (Millipore) in 5 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.3. Aliquots of each purification step were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to confirm purity. Protein concentration was determined by Lowry assay. Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) of various phospholipids were prepared by suspending the dry phospholipid film in PBS, pH 7.3, and vortexing for 10 min. Small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were subsequently prepared by sonicating MLVs using a probe sonicator for 10 s several times with intermittent 30-s cooling period at 0 °C (42Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). α-Syn (final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) was mixed with MLVs or SUVs (final concentration 0.5–4 mg/ml) in 500 μl of PBS to give a 2.5:1 to 20:1 weight ratio of phospholipid to α-Syn. The mixture was incubated for 2 or 24 h at 25 °C. For MLVs containing α-Syn, the dry phospholipid film was dispersed in α-Syn solution, and the mixture was vortexed for 10 min. For salt-dependent binding studies, the lipids were dispersed in 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing both α-Syn and varying concentrations of NaCl (0–800 mm). As a control, α-Syn alone was dissolved in 5 mm phosphate buffer containing 0, 200, and 800 mm NaCl. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter at room temperature. Incubated samples were placed in a 1-mm path length quartz cell to minimize the absorbance due to buffer components. Spectra were obtained from 195 to 250 nm, with a 0.5-nm step, 1-nm band width, and a speed of 20 nm/min. Three scans per sample were averaged. All spectra were corrected by subtracting background spectrum of the buffer or the lipid vesicles. Cerebellum (0.5–1 g) or temporal cortex from human brain (non-diseased, 92 yr-old male) was homogenized with a Polytron in 1.8 ml of PBS. Chloroform and methanol (2:1) were added to the brain homogenate to give a Folch partition, chloroform:methanol:water (PBS) = 2:1:0.6. The mixture was vortexed vigorously and allowed to separate in a separatory funnel. After 3 h when both phases were clear, the lower phase was recovered and filtered. The upper phase was re-extracted with theoretical lower phase (chloroform:methanol:water = 86:14:1). The filtered lower phases were dried under a stream of nitrogen gas. The resulting lipid films were dissolved in 0.4–4 ml of chloroform:methanol (2:1) and kept at −20 °C until use. The final upper phase was lyophilized and dissolved in 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1). Chloroform, methanol, and 0.25% KCl were combined at a ratio of 5:4:1 and used as a standard TLC running solvent. Human cerebellar lipid extracts along with phospholipid standards (2–15 μg per lane) were applied to silica gel TLC plates and run until the solvent front was ∼1 cm below the top of the plate. After being air-dried, the TLC plate was cut in half, turning to twin plates, one for the detection of total lipids and the other for the overlay with α-Syn. For total lipids, the TLC plate was sprayed with a mixture of 10% CuSO4·H2O and 8% H3PO4 and heated for 5 min at 170 °C (43Ganser A.L. Kerner A.L. Brown B.J. Davisson M.T. Kirschner D.A. Dev. Neurosci. 1988; 10: 99-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To detect PE and PS, which contain amide groups, the TLC plate was alternatively sprayed with 0.5% ninhydrin (Sigma) in a mixture of 20 ml of glacial acetic acid and 80 ml of ethanol and heated for 5 min at 110 °C. TLC plates were treated with poly(isobutyl methacrylate) to prevent silica loss and to orient the lipid head groups suitable for ligand binding (44Yiu S.C. Lingwood C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 202: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To block nonspecific binding, plates were incubated in 0.6% gelatin with shaking for 1 h at 37 °C. After a brief rinse with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), pH 7.6, the TLC plate was incubated with 2 mg of α-Syn in 7 ml of TBS overnight at room temperature. After rinsing with TBS, the TLC plate was incubated with monoclonal anti-α-synuclein antibody. After extensive washing, synuclein immunoreactivity was detected by peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Solution tapping mode atomic force microscopy images were acquired on a Digital Instruments Nanoscope IIIA MultiMode scanning probe microscope (Digital Instruments, Santa Barbara, CA) using 120-μm oxide-sharpened silicon nitride V-shaped cantilevers installed in combination contact/tapping mode liquid flow cell. The AFM images were acquired using the E scanning head, which has a maximum lateral scan area of 14.6 μm × 14.6 μm. All imaging was performed at tip scan rates from 1.25 to 2 Hz, using cantilever drive frequencies of ∼8.9 kHz. All images were captured as 512 × 512 pixel images and were low-pass filtered. Feature size and volumes were calculated using the Digital Instruments Nanoscope software (version 4.21) and shareware image analysis program, NIH-Image (version 1.62). In situ tapping mode atomic force microscopy experiments were performed by sequential addition of the solutions to the AFM fluid cell. Planar bilayers were formed by directly injecting ∼500 μl of the ∼1 mg/ml POPC/POPS suspension into the AFM fluid cell, previously sealed against a piece of freshly cleaved mica and allowing the vesicles to fuse in situ. The cell was flushed with neat buffer and reference tapping mode atomic force microscopy height and phase images were acquired in PBS, pH 7.4, to confirm formation of stable lipid bilayers. Approximately 500 μl of α-Syn in PBS at 0.1 mg/ml were injected directly into the AFM cell and imaging initiated 30 min after the protein was introduced. α-Syn has been reported to bind to rat brain vesicles (35Jensen P.H.

This prompted us to apply TLC overlay to determine whether α-Syn exhibits any specficity for a particular lipid extracted from human brain. Total extracts obtained from either cerebellum or temporal cortex were separated on a TLC plate and incubated with purified α-Syn. Approximately 9–11 individual lipid bands were observed (Fig.2 A, lane 1) and only two showed any significant interaction with α-Syn (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). In order to identify these α-Syn-binding lipids, commercially available lipids were run on TLC plates as references and overlaid with α-Syn (Fig. 2, A and B, lanes 2–6). α-Syn was found to bind to phosphatidylethanolamine (E. coli and brain PE), lyso-PE (brain lyso-PE), phosphatidylinositol (liver PI) and showed a detectable but much weaker interaction with phosphatidylserine (POPS and brain PS) (Fig.2 B). No interaction was observed for phosphatidylcholine (POPC), phosphatidic acid (POPA), sphingomyelin (brain sphingomyelin), or cholesterol (Fig. 2 B). Nonspecific immunoreactivity was not observed with similar TLC-separated lipids exposed to the anti-synuclein antibody alone (i.e. without prior incubation with recombinant α-Syn) or with the secondary antibody (data not shown). It was surprising that α-Syn did not bind to phosphatidic acid (PA) on TLC plate (Fig. 2, lane 6) since α-Syn was reported to bind to the SUVs containing acidic phospholipids, such as PS, PI, and PA (31Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). This discrepancy can be attributed to the physical properties of the TLC overlay method. These findings suggest the possibility of some specificity of α-Syn for particular lipids which may be relevant to its function. However, the overlay technique may not identify all α-Syn binding lipids (e.g. phosphatidic acid) due to these technical constraints. Significant binding of α-Syn to brain PE was observed which may reflect a similar in vivointeraction. When these reference lipids were compared with the brain lipid extracts in parallel on a TLC plate, the location of purified brain PE (Fig. 2,lane 2, upper band) coincided with the upper band of the α-Syn binding lipid bands from the brain lipid extracts (Fig.2 B, lane 1, upper band). The lower lipid band present in the brain lipid extracts ran similarly to purified PS, PI, and lyso-PE. In order to confirm that the α-Syn-positive bands are PE and PS, the lipid samples on the TLC plate were examined using the ninhydrin reaction. This reaction is specific for amide and amine groups that are only found in PE and PS. Both overlay positive bands and reference PS and PE were stained with ninhydrin, confirming that the overlay positive bands are PE and PS, respectively (data not shown). In addition to the solid phase assay, we screened a variety of phospholipids for α-Syn binding, using phospholipid liposomes. It has been reported that α-Syn binds to SUVs containing acidic phospholipids, which results in an increased α-helical conformation in α-Syn (31Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). We report herein the following novel findings regarding the association of α-Syn with lipids. (i) The binding of α-Syn with acidic phospholipids is dose-dependent; (ii) the extent of lipid binding depends rather on the availability of the phospholipids than on the size of lipid vesicles (SUVs versus MLVs); (iii) α-Syn binding to phospholipid vesicles increases drastically when an acidic phospholipid is mixed with PE instead of PC; and (iv) α-Syn binding to acidic phospholipid (with PC or PE) vesicles is inversely proportional to the ionic strength. In the first instance, α-Syn was incubated with POPC or POPC:POPS (1:1, w/w) SUVs. CD spectroscopy was used to monitor changes in α-Syn secondary structure upon binding to the lipid vesicles. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the spectrum of α-Syn in PBS, pH 7.3, showed a minimum ellipticity at 200 nm, indicating a random coiled secondary structure. In the presence of POPC SUVs, the CD spectrum revealed a subtle shift toward α-helical conformation. In the presence of POPC/POPS SUVs, the spectrum clearly showed a typical α-helical secondary structure with the characteristic minima at 208 and 222 nm. The intensity of the α-helicity increased as the concentration of POPC/POPS was increased from 0.5 mg/ml (lipid:protein = 2.5:1, w/w) to 2 mg/ml (lipid:protein = 10:1, w/w) (Fig. 3 B). The spectrum did not change significantly when the POPC/POPS concentration was increased from 2 to 4 mg/ml, indicating that the binding of α-Syn to POPC/POPS SUVs was saturated at a lipid concentration of 2 mg/ml. Second, we examined the interaction of α-Syn with SUVs in comparison to MLVs since the curvature of SUVs has been suggested to affect protein-lipid interactions (31Davidson W.S. Jonas A. Clayton D.F. George J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9443-9449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1259) Google Scholar). When preformed POPC/POPS MLVs at 2 mg/ml were added to α-Syn in PBS, the CD spectrum did not change significantly from its random coiled structure (Fig.4). This seemed to be due to the fact that only the outermost lipid bilayer is available for α-Syn binding and the inner layers are inaccessible to α-Syn, resulting in an actual concentration of the available lipids much less than 2 mg/ml. In contrast, when POPC/POPS MLVs (2 mg/ml) were made in PBS containing α-Syn, the CD spectrum showed a characteristic α-helical structure (Fig. 4), similar to the one obtained by adding POPC/POPS SUVs at 2 mg/ml to α-Syn in PBS. Therefore, the extent of lipid binding was dependent on the availability of lipids rather than on the size of the vesicles (SUVs versus MLVs). The A53T mutant α-Syn was also examined"

At the same time, these organisms must maintain intracellular copper below a toxic threshold. In eukaryotes, intracellular copper is controlled by uptake systems, copper chaperones that facilitate specific loading of copper into enzymes, metallothioneins that bind excess copper, efflux systems that remove copper from the cell, and copper-responsive metalloregulatory proteins that coordinate all these mechanisms (1Pena M.M.

The chromosomal cop system ofEnterococcus hirae, which contains copper uptake, efflux, and metalloregulatory components, represents one well characterized example of copper homeostasis in prokaryotes (3Strausak D. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8932-8936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Whereas few direct homologues of known copper homeostasis proteins have been found in E. coli, copper export systems have been identified, including the plasmid-encoded copper resistance determinants (4Brown N.L. Barrett S.R. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Rouch D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Numerous attempts have been made to identify the genes involved in controlling copper levels in E. coli; however, few of these genes have been directly linked to copper metabolism, transport, or regulation (5Fong S.T.

For instance, the nlpE (cutF) gene, which encodes for a novel lipoprotein, and dipZ(cutA2), which encodes for a disulfide isomerase, have indirect connections with copper metabolism (6Gupta S.D.

The recently characterized gene copA, which encodes a copper-inducible P-type ATPase (8Rensing C. Fan B. Sharma R. Mitra B. Rosen B.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar), represents a central component in E. colicopper efflux. The factors responsible for the copper-responsive expression of E. coli copA have not been characterized. Recently, the first copper-responsive regulatory system in the E. coli chromosome, a two-component signal transduction system designated Cu-sensing or cus locus, was identified (9Munson G.P. Lam D. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5865-5872Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The cusRS genes form a sensor/regulator pair that activates the adjacent but divergently transcribed gene,cusC, and possibly two adjacent downstream genes,cusBA, in response to increasing copper. ThecusCBA genes are homologous to a family of proton-cation antiporter complexes involved in the export of metal ions, xenobiotics, and drugs (10Saier Jr., M.H. Tam R. Reizer A. Reizer J. Mol.

C.2000: 145-157Google Scholar). We set out to identify the regulator of E. coli copA because of its established importance in copper homeostasis. Our analysis of the copA promoter showed no CusRS-binding element; however, it did reveal a long spacer between the −10 and −35 elements reminiscent of promoters regulated by the metalloregulatory protein, MerR (12O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K. Ralston D.M. Wright J.G. Cell. 1989; 56: 119-129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 13Lund P.A. Brown N.L. J. Mol.

A search of the E. coli chromosome uncovered a second promoter located upstream of the putative multi-copper oxidaseyacK, which contained similar MerR-like features. Upon searching for a MerR homologue that might regulate these genes, we found the gene ybbI. Deletion of ybbI resulted in the disruption of copper-responsive regulation at both yacKand copA, establishing these genes as a copper-inducible regulon. The gene ybbI encodes a copper-activated homologue of MerR and was designated cueR for Cu efflux regulator. Likewise, the yacKgene was renamed cueO for Cueffluxoxidase. All polymerase chain reactions (PCR)1 described used E. coli DH5α chromosomal DNA as the template unless otherwise stated. All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing, and all DNA manipulations employed standard protocols (14Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

Selected cultures were then induced with 0.5 mmCuSO4 for 60 min. Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation kit. Primer copA:PE1 (5′-GGA CAG GCC GTC CAG GGT CAG G-3′) was end-labeled with 32P. 10 μg of total RNA was preheated to 65 °C with copA:PE1 for 5 min and chilled on ice. A primer/RNA mixture was added to the reaction buffer with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (New England Biolabs) and incubated at 42 °C for 60 min. The sequencing of pUC19/copA with labeled copA:PE1 was carried out with the CircumVent Thermal Cycle Dideoxy DNA sequencing kit (New England Biolabs) as directed by the manufacturer's instructions. Primer extension and sequencing samples were run on an 8m urea, 8% acrylamide gel and exposed overnight. The copA promoter was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers copA/EcoRI (5′-GAT GCG GGA GGG AAT TCC TCA CCC C-3′) and copA/AvaI (5′-CTG CTC AAC ACC CGG GCG CTG TTC AAG-3′). The PCR fragment was digested with EcoRI and AvaI and inserted into the EcoRI/AvaI sites of pUC19 (New England Biolabs) to create pUC19/copA. TheBamHI/EcoRI fragment of pUC19/copA was excised and cloned into pRS551 to make a copA-lacZ promoter fusion. To remove upstream regulatory elements, pUC19/copAwas used as a template for PCR with primers PTcopA (5′-CTT TAC GGA CTT GAA TTC GCC TGG TTT ATT-3′) and −47 (New England Biolabs). This fragment was digested and cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pRS551 to create pRS551/PTcopA. Single copy copA-lacZpromoter fusion strains were constructed by transduction as described previously (17Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst. ). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). A 307-base pair portion of the upstream region ofyacK was amplified using primersyacK/EcoRI (5′-GTT TGC GCA GAC GGA ATT CAG GCT GCC G-3′) and yacK/BamHI (5′-GCA AAT ACT GCG CGG ATC CAC AGC G-3′). The fragment was digested withEcoRI/BamHI and cloned into theEcoRI/BamHI sites of pRS551 to create pRS551/yacK. Single copy reporter lysogens were then constructed as described (17Simons R.W. Houman F. Kleckner N. Gene (Amst. ). 1987; 53: 85-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (1306) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase assays were conducted as described previously (18Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Briefly, a 1:50 dilution of saturated lysogen culture was used to inoculate the chemically defined medium (see above) containing 40 μg/ml kanamycin. Cultures in the exponential phase were exposed to varying metal concentrations for 60 min followed by assay of β-galactosidase activity. The gene ybbI(hereafter referred to as cueR) was disrupted by the insertion of a KanR cassette using a protocol developed in the laboratory of B. Wanner and based on the λ Red system as described previously in detail (16Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11405) Google Scholar). Here a PCR fragment was generated using primers cueR(PS1) (5′-GTG CGC AGT ACT TCC TGT ATT ATT GTG GTG GCG GTC GAT GTG TAG GCT GCT TC-3′) and cueR(PS2) (5′-GGG ATA ACC CTA CAT ATC CGA GCC GTC TCG TCT TAA TCA CAT ATG AAT ATC CTC CTT AGT-3′) and electroporated into strain BW25113 resulting in insertion into cueR. The first 39 nucleotides ofcueR(PS1) and cueR(PS2) correspond to chromosomal sequences flanking cueR. The use of these primers with pKD4 as template generates a 1.5-kilobase pair fragment that contains a KanR cassette flanked by FRT (FLP recognition target) sites and, on termini, by short stretches of ybbIsequence. To construct WOII248B (cueR), the KanRwas removed creating an internal deletion in cueR as described previously (16Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11405) Google Scholar). For complementation experiments,cueR was amplified using primerscueR(EcoRI) (5′-CCT GCG TCA TGG AAT TCA CGC CTC G-3′) and cueR(BamHI) (5′-GGT AAT GTT TGG GAT CCT GAC GCT GCT C-3′). The fragment was digested with BamHI and cloned into the EcoRV/BamHI sites of pACYC184 (New England Biolabs) to make pACYC184/cueR, which was maintained with 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol. ThecueR gene was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA using primers CueR N-terminal (5′-GGC GTT GCG CGA CAT ATG AAC ATC AGC G-3′) and CueR C-terminal (5′-CCG AGC CGG ATC CTC TTA ATC ACC CTG C-3′). The fragment was digested with NdeI and BamHI and inserted into the overexpression vector pET24a (New England Biolabs), which was then transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). The overexpression and purification of CueR is the same as described previously for the ZntR protein (19Outten C.E. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37517-37524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) without the hydrophobic column step. The molecular mass of CueR (calculated 15,235.0 Da with first Met) was found to be 15,235.4 Da by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (PerSpective Biosystems Voyager-DE). The plasmid pUC19/copA (see above) was used for labeling in footprinting assays. DNA labeling and DNase I footprinting procedures are the same as described previously (19Outten C.E. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37517-37524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The only previously identified copper-responsive regulatory system on the E. coli chromosome is the CusRS two-component system (9Munson G.P. Lam D. Outten F.W. O'Halloran T.V. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5865-5872Crossref Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To determine if copA is under the regulatory control of CusRS and to map the transcriptional start site for the copA promoter, primer extension analysis was conducted using a wild-type strain, DH5α, and a ΔcusRSstrain, DLG. As the primer extension results show in Fig.1, copA transcription is induced by copper in a manner independent of the CusRS system. The absence of a consensus “copper box” upstream of the −35 element is consistent with a lack of CusRS regulation. This result also establishes the start site of the copA promoter (Fig.1). To obtain a more routine measure of promoter activity, thecopA promoter region was cloned, fused to lacZ, and transduced as a single copy reporter. The results of the zinc and copper induction profiles are shown in Fig.2 A. From these experiments, it is clear that the copA promoter is primarily induced by copper because neither zinc nor mercury (data not shown) was able to induce. The lack of CusRS regulation indicates the existence of an alternative copper-responsive signal transduction system. The unusual spacing seen in the copA promoter (Fig. 6 A) indicates that it may be regulated by a MerR family member. Inspection of the E. coli genome sequence revealed an uncharacterized MerR homologue,ybbI. To test for ybbI regulation ofcopA in vivo, ybbI was disrupted on the chromosome by the insertion of a KanR cassette using a λ Red-mediated mutagenesis system (16Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11405) Google Scholar). Strains lackingybbI showed a complete loss of copper induction at thecopA promoter (Fig. 2 A). A construct containingybbI carried on the pACYC184 low copy vector was able to complement the ΔybbI phenotype (Fig.3 A), confirming thatybbI (renamed cueR for Cuefflux regulator) is the copper-responsive positive activator of copA.Figure 3Complementation of cueR with pACYC184/cueR.

A palindrome positioned between the −35 and −10 hexamers of the predicted promoter for the gene yacK was found. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the location of the palindrome in relation to the −35 and −10 boxes and the 19-base pair promoter element spacing are identical to thecopA promoter. To test whether CueR regulates expression of yacK in vivo, the yacK promoter was cloned from the chromosome, fused to lacZ, and transduced as a single copy reporter. As seen with copA, the yacK promoter is responsive to copper but not to zinc (Fig. 2 B). Moreover, copper-responsive regulation of yacK depends upon the presence of cueR. The cueR deletion strain shows a loss of copper activation at the yacK promoter (Fig.2 B). By providing the cueR gene intrans on a low copy number plasmid (Fig. 3 B), copper induction of yacK is restored. Sequence analysis of YacK indicates that it is homologous to the multi-copper oxidases PcoA and CopA found in the plasmid-borne copper resistance operons,pco from E. coli and cop fromPseudomonas syringae (20Bryson J.W.

The gene pcoAfacilitates copper export from the cell by an unknown mechanism (4Brown N.L. Barrett S.R. Camakaris J. Lee B.T. Rouch D.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 1153-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). ThecopA promoter sequence contains an unusual 19-base pair spacing between the −10 and −35 elements. Both this long spacer and palindromic sequences found within the −10/−35 region (Fig.6 A) are similar to those found in promoters regulated by other members of the MerR family of transcriptional regulators, including SoxR and ZntR (12O'Halloran T.V.

Microbiol. 1999; 31: 893-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, thecopA promoter contains a weak consensus UP element just upstream of the −35 site. Adjacent to that is a consensus binding site for the cell envelope stress response regulator, CpxR (24De Wulf P. Kwon O. Lin E.C. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6772-6778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether copper responsiveness is mediated by the MerR-like region or by other upstream elements, various alterations in thecopA promoter were made. The entire upstream region beyond the typical UP element region, including the putative CpxR binding site, was removed from the 5′-end of thecopA-lacZ promoter fusion. Fig.4 A demonstrates that copper-responsive activation of copA is still observed after the removal of the upstream region. The absence of this region of the promoter, however, resulted in less than maximum induction at high copper concentrations, suggesting that other upstream regulatory elements may work in synergy with CueR to increase the level of transcription under high copper stress. In contrast, two single nucleotide changes in the predicted CueR operator at the −19 and −31 positions abolished copper responsiveness at the copApromoter (Fig. 4 B). These mutations do not affect core promoter elements or the length of the spacer region, but they are important positions in the operators of MerR-like proteins. Finally, to test whether CueR directly interacts with the copA promoter, CueR was purified and its DNase I footprint was determined. Fig.5 shows that CueR binds between the −35 and −10 elements of the copA promoter, confirming that the palindrome is the CueR operator. The size of the footprint, its location within the spacer, and the internal DNase I hypersensitive sites are hallmarks of footprints for MerR family proteins (12O'Halloran T.V. Frantz B. Shin M.K.

Nature. 1995; 374: 371-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). From these results we conclude that CueR exerts positive control at PcopA and is the primary copper-responsive activator.Figure 5CueR DNase I footprinting of the non-template strand of PcopA.

One of the copper-regulated promoters drives the expression ofcopA, which encodes a copper efflux pump. The other CueR-regulated gene, yacK, encodes a putative multi-copper oxidase similar to those observed in the P. syringae andE. coli plasmid-based copper resistance operons (26Cooksey D.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1994; 14: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). The predicted gene product of yacK contains all 12 of the conserved residues that were found to be important for metal binding in the crystal structure of ascorbate oxidase (27Messerschmidt A. Rossi A. Ladenstein R. Huber R. Bolognesi M. Gatti G. Marchesini A. Petruzzelli R. Finazzi-Agro A. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 513-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Unlike ascorbate oxidase, YacK has a stretch of about 50 residues with an unusually high methionine content (33% of residues in that region). A similar Met-rich region is observed in the ascorbate oxidase homologues, PcoA and CopA (P. syringae), both of which are essential components of their respective copper resistance operons (20Bryson J.W. O'Halloran T.V. Rouch D.A. Brown N.L. Camakaris J. Lee B.T.O. Karlin K.D. Tyeklár Z. Bioinorganic Chemistry of Copper. Chapman & Hall, New York1993: 101-109Crossref Google Scholar). Based on these similarities, yacK was renamed cueO forCuefflux oxidase. All three of the putative oxidases involved in copper detoxification have leader sequences for export and are predicted to be periplasmic proteins. Interestingly, PcoA, CopA (P. syringae), and CueO also contain N-terminal twin arginine motifs similar to the consensus SRRXFLK (SRRTFLK for PcoA, SRRTFVK for CopA (P. syringae), and QRRDFLK for CueO). This sequence targets folded proteins for export via the Tat pathway (28Stanley N.R. Palmer T. Berks B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11591-11596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). These similarities suggest that CueO, PcoA, and CopA (P. syringae) may play analogous roles in protecting the cell from excess copper; however, the molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Based on the sequence similarities among CueR, ZntR, and MerR (Fig.6 B), it is likely that CueR detects cytoplasmic copper stress and activates transcription in response to increasing copper concentrations. CueR consists of binding region and a C-terminal metal binding region, that are also conserved in both ZntR and MerR. CueR does, however, lack a Cys residue that is conserved at approximately position 80 in the ZntR and MerR sequence (Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, the spacing between two other highly conserved Cys residues is shorter in CueR than in either ZntR or MerR (Fig. 6 B). These differences in the putative metal binding domain may create a receptor site that allows CueR to distinguish between copper, zinc, and mercury. Interestingly, we find evidence of a role for potential upstream elements in the regulation of the CopA copper efflux transporter. Removal of the upstream region, which includes a CpxR consensus site, decreases the maximum induction observed at the highest copper concentrations tested. The exact nature of this synergy remains to be elucidated. These results define the first copper-responsive regulon in E. coli. This brings the number of chromosomal, copper-sensing regulatory systems in E. coli to two: CusRS, which may sense copper levels in the periplasm, and CueR, which is probably a cytoplasmic sensor. Each system activates transcription of independent copper efflux systems in E. coli. The presence of two copper efflux systems highlights the potential toxicity of copper. At present it is not clear if the copA/cueO andcusCBA efflux systems are redundant or if differential advantages can be gained from each system under specific growth or stress conditions. This component of copper signal transduction in bacteria provides a springboard from which to address the molecular mechanisms of copper homeostasis in prokaryotes. We thank B. Wanner for the generous gift of strains and protocols in advance of publication, N. Welker, M. Parsek, and C. Singer for helpful suggestions, and T. Rae for technical assistance."

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments revealed that presenilin fragments are assembled into a high molecular weight complex together with other proteins (for review see 11–13). The proposed mechanism through which the presenilin mutations cause AD is an alteration in the predominant γ-secretase cleavage site which increases the amount of the longer, more amyloidogenic Aβ 1–42(43) fragments produced (11Czech C.

These observations indicate that PS-1 and PS-2 either stimulate the activity of γ-secretase by trafficking to appropriate cellular compartments, serve as cofactors of the γ-secretase, or are γ-secretase themselves. Here, we report that a series of potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitors bind to mammalian cell membranes and specifically cross-link to three major polypeptides. Immunological techniques identified PS-1 and PS-2 as the major, specifically cross-linked polypeptides. These results indicate that this series of potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitors blocks Aβ formation by binding to PS-1 and PS-2 Binding assays using [3H]Compound A (see Table I; 87.5 Ci/mmol) were performed using standard methods (17Keen M. Walker J.M. Receptor Binding Techniques. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1999: 106Google Scholar). THP-1 cells were grown in Spinner cultures in RPMI 1640 containing l-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 10 μm β-mercaptoethanol to a density of 5 × 105/ml. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and cell pellets were quick frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at −70 °C prior to use. The pellets of approximately 2 × 108 THP-1 cells were homogenized in 10 ml of either 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, at 4 °C, using a Brinkmann Polytron at setting 6 for 10 s. The homogenate was centrifuged at 48,000 × g for 12 min, and the resulting pellet was washed by repeating the homogenization and centrifugation steps. The final cell pellet was resuspended in buffer to yield a protein concentration of approximately 0.5 mg/ml. Assays were initiated by the addition of 150 μl of membrane suspension to 150 μl of assay buffer containing 0.064 μCi of radioligand and various concentrations of unlabeled compounds. Binding assays were performed in duplicate in polypropylene 96- well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in a final volume of 0.3 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, or 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide. Nonspecific binding was defined in the presence of 300 nm Compound E or as indicated in the figure legends. After incubating at 23 °C for 1.3 h (or as indicated in the figure legends), the separation of bound from free radioligand was accomplished by filtration over GFF glass fiber filters (Inotech Biosystems International, Lansing, MI) presoaked in 0.3% ethyleneimine polymer solution using an Inotech cell harvester. Filters were washed three times with 0.3 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.0, containing 0.01% Triton X-100. Filters were assessed for radioactivity by liquid scintillation counting using a Packard 2500 TR (Packard Instrument Co., Downers Grove, IL).

THP-1 membranes for cross-linking studies were prepared as outlined for the binding studies. Membranes were preincubated for 30 min at room temperature with labeled Compound C in the presence or absence of unlabeled competitors. Photolysis at 365 nm was performed for 1 h at room temperature. The membranes were harvested by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 20 min), resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 668-680Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The following experiments were performed to optimize the cross-linking conditions. (i) The membrane protein concentration was varied from 1 to 10 mg/ml. (ii) Ligand concentrations were varied from 10 to 120 nm. (iii) Cross-linking temperature was varied between 4 °C and room temperature. Overall, the specifically labeled polypeptides patterns were not altered by any of the above procedures. In addition, the intensity of the labeling increased between 5 and 30 min of UV illumination and plateaued thereafter. The cross-linking experiments presented in this manuscript were all performed with 1 h of illumination. Similar gel patterns were obtained when samples were analyzed under nonreducing and reducing conditions. However, boiling for extended periods of time resulted in multimerization and disappearance of specifically labeled polypeptides. THP-1 membranes (10 mg/ml) were incubated with radiolabeled Compound C (120 nm) for 30 min at room temperature followed by photolysis at room temperature for 1 h. The membranes were harvested by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 20 min) and extracted (10 mg of membrane proteins/ml of extraction buffer) with 2% CHAPS, 50 mmTris buffer, pH 7.4, for 1 h at 4 °C in the presence of complete protease inhibitors (one tablet of protease inhibitors/25 ml of extraction buffer; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The membrane extract was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. Similar results were obtained with membrane extracts centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Comparison of different extraction procedures revealed that 2% CHAPS quantitatively solubilized the cross-linked polypeptides compared with SDS sample buffer, which was assumed to solubilize the membrane proteins completely. The membrane extract was diluted with an equal volume of distilled water and preabsorbed (1 h; 4 °C) with normal mouse serum (10 μl/ml of extract) and goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose (Sigma). The beads were removed by centrifugation followed by the addition of antibodies to PS-1 (10 μg/ml) and goat anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 1% CHAPS in binding buffer (1 ml each wash) and three times with phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml each wash). Bound proteins were eluted by boiling (approximately 3 min) in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (18Laemmli U. Nature. 1970; 227: 668-680Crossref Scopus (206631) Google Scholar) and fluorography. For immunoprecipitation of PS-2 fragments, the CHAPS extract was preabsorbed with normal rabbit serum, and protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) was used instead of the anti-mouse IgG-Sepharose. Normal mouse IgG (Sigma) or anti-PS-1 IgG was immobilized to an agarose matrix (AminoLink Plus Immobilization Kit) at 2 mg/ml of beads according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). THP-1 membrane extracts (5 mg/ml membrane proteins) in 1% CHAPS, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, were applied by batch absorption (16 h; room temperature) to the normal mouse IgG column. The nonbound fraction was recovered by centrifugation and applied by batch absorption (16 h; room temperature) to the PS-1 column. Both columns were washed extensively in parallel with 1% CHAPS, 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, followed by 1% CHAPS in distilled water and eluted (15 min; room temperature) with 0.1 m glycine, 0.5% CHAPS, pH 2.3. The elution fractions were neutralized immediately by the addition of 1 m Tris, pH 9.5. For immunoblotting analysis, polypeptides were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and analyzed as described (19Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

Aβ 1–40 in the resultant conditioned media was quantified by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a position 40 neoepitope-specific monoclonal antibody and a biotinylated monoclonal antibody directed to Aβ residues 10–20. Compounds A–D and F and G were prepared according to the general synthesis strategy shown in Scheme FS1 following the methods described in PCT application WO 00/07995.t-Butoxycarbonyl-caprolactam 1 was deprotonated with lithium diisopropylamide and alkylated with a benzylic halide to introduce the diaryl ether or benzophenone substituent. In the case of Compound G, 3-iodobenzyl bromide was employed, which allowed the subsequent construction of the biaryl group using Suzuki coupling. The t-butoxycarbonyl group was removed using trifluoroacetic acid and the resulting amine was coupled to a substituted succinic acid derivative using the coupling agent hexafluorophosphate in the presence of diisopropylethylamine. The succinic acid derivatives were prepared using Evans' oxazolidinone methodology according to published procedures (21 and WO 97/18207). After coupling, the t-butyl ester was removed using trifluoroacetic acid and the primary amide was prepared using hexafluorophosphate and excess gaseous ammonia. Compound D was prepared in an analogous fashion using 3-(S)-amino-1-methyl-5-phenyl-1,3-dihydro-benzo[e](1,4)diazepin-2-one as described in PCT application WO 00/07995. Compound E was prepared according to WO 98/28268. [3H]Compound C was labeled at the propyl site chain by reduction in the presence of tritium gas. Briefly, to a reaction vessel containing a stirred solution of (2-allyl-N4-[1-(3-benzoyl-benzyl)-2-oxo-azepan-3-yl]-3-isobutyl-succinamide, 10 mg) in tetrahydrofuran (2 ml) was added 10% palladium on carbon (10 mg). The reaction vessel was evacuated and degassed via a freeze-thaw evacuation cycle and then exposed to tritium gas (50 Ci). After 30 min, unreacted tritium gas was removed, and the catalyst was filtered from the reaction mixture. The solvent was removed in vacuo, and the labile tritium was further removed by evaporation with methanol (three times 2 ml). The residue was dissolved in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/methanol (50:50; 10 ml) and purified on a reversed-phase HPLC column (Zorbax SB- C18, 25 × 0.92 cm) using 50% acetonitrile in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid as the mobile phase (flow rate 2 ml/min). Fractions containing the product were pooled, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The product was dissolved in ethanol (145 mCi, 15.5 mCi/ml).

The C-terminal monoclonal antibody (clone 361) was obtained by immunizing mice with a synthetic peptide to PS-1 residues 309–331. Rat anti-PS-1 N-terminal monoclonal antibody and PS-1 polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Chemicon. Antibodies to PS-2 were kindly provided by Bart De Strooper. Embryonic tissue from PS-1 and PS-2 gene target animals was provided by Bart De Strooper and Paul Saftig. We have identified a series of small molecules (Compounds A–D, F, and G) which inhibit the formation of the Aβ 1–40 and 1–42 peptides in βAPP-transfected and nontransfected mammalian cells with nanomolar potencies2 (TableI). For comparison, we have also characterized Compound E, described in the patent literature (PCT application WO 98/28268). Aβ formation was specifically inhibited without any signs of cellular toxicity in in vitroassays.2 These compounds have been classified as inhibitors of γ-secretase by virtue of their ability to induce the increased accumulation of the C-terminal 99-amino acid fragment of βAPP (CT99),2 the substrate for γ-secretase action which results from β-secretase processing (1Selkoe D.J.

[3H]Compound A bound specifically and reversibly to rat brain membranes (not shown). A survey of established mammalian cell lines was performed to identify a high expressing, easily grown cellular source for membrane binding and molecular target identification. Of the eight lines analyzed, membranes from a human macrophage cell line, THP-1, possessed the highest specific binding capacity (B max). The B maxwas 1,057 ± 138 (n = 2) fmol/mg THP-1 membrane protein. Association kinetics using THP-1 membranes revealed aK d of 2.4 nm and at 12 of association of 0.75 +/= 0.49 min (n = 2). In addition, Compound A blocked Aβ formation in THP-1 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that THP-1 cells contain the pharmacological site for Aβ lowering and membrane binding. The correlation between cellular potency (IC50 for inhibition of Aβ formation in Chinese hamster ovary cells overexpressing βAPP) and K i for membrane binding is indicated in Table I for seven compounds ranging over 4 log units in affinity; we observed a significant correlation (r 2 = 0.96; p < 0.0001 (two-tailed t test)) for displacement of a radiolabeled γ-secretase inhibitor and cellular potency for Aβ lowering. A similar correlation was observed using Compound C (a photochemical cross-linker) or D as ligand. Moreover, a positive correlation between cellular potency and membrane binding was also observed in human cell lines expressing endogenous βAPP, IMR32 neuroblastoma cells, and in human embryonic kidney (HEK 293) cells overexpressing βAPP (data not shown). These results strongly suggest that the membrane preparations contain the intact molecular target of γ-secretase inhibitors. Photocross-linking experiments were performed to identify the target of these γ-secretase inhibitors. THP-1 membranes were preincubated with radiolabeled Compound C in the absence or presence of the indicated unlabeled competitors. Membranes were analyzed by binding (Fig. 1 A) or by cross-linking after exposure to UV light (Fig. 1 B). After cross-linking, membranes were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by fluorography (Fig.2 B). Several major polypeptides of 43, 30, 25, 20, and 14 kDa (as well as several minor species) were identified by the cross-linking approach. The reduction in specific binding in the binding assay by competing with unlabeled inhibitors (panel A) correlated with the reduction in cross-linking intensity of the 30-, 25-, 20-, and 14-kDa polypeptides (panel B). No additional specifically labeled polypeptides were observed when cross-linked polypeptides were analyzed by 15% polyacrylamide gels (not shown). Importantly, a chemically similar, yet much less potent compound (Compound B) failed to compete for cross-linking of specifically labeled bands of 30, 25, 20, and 14 kDa (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Also, Compound B did compete for major cross-linking band at 43 kDa, whereas the active Compounds A and E did not compete for the 43-kDa band. Taken together, these observations allow us to classify the 43-kDa band as nonspecifically labeled. Moreover, the specific cross-linking to the 30-, 25-, and 20-kDa bands was also observed in HEK 293 cells (data not shown). Additional experiments established a dose-dependent reduction in specific binding and cross-linking intensity. For example, for each of the seven compounds analyzed, the corresponding pair of dose-response curves for inhibition of binding and reduction in photocross-linking was indistinguishable for compounds ranging over 4 log potency (0.3–7,900 nm). For example, the parallel reduction of binding and cross-linking intensity of the 30-, 25-, and 20-kDa bands is indicated for Compound D in Fig. 2. The molecular sizes of the cross-linked polypeptides (11Czech C. Tremp G. Pradier L. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 60: 363-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 12Haass C.

Science. 1999; 286: 916-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) are, in part, consistent with the hypothesis that presenilins are the molecular target. To determine whether Compound C cross-linked to presenilins, membranes were incubated with tritiated Compound C, cross-linked, extracted with 2% CHAPS, and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies to PS-1. Extraction of membranes with 2% CHAPS quantitatively solubilized the specifically cross-linked polypeptides. Regardless of subunit specificity, antibodies to PS-1 are expected to immunoprecipitate both N- and C-terminal PS-1 fragments because CHAPS extraction does not dissociate the PS-1 complex (22Capell A.

The major labeled polypeptides of 30 and 20 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with antibodies to PS-1 (Fig. 3). Similar immunoprecipitation patterns were observed with three commercially available antibodies to PS-1 (data not shown; see antibody listing under “Experimental Procedures”). The immunoprecipitation was specific, as shown by the disappearance of radiolabeled bands when cross-linking was performed in the presence of excess Compound E or when the PS-1 antibody was replaced by normal mouse IgG. In addition, the PS-1 antibodies immunoprecipitated only the specifically cross-linked polypeptides, whereas nonspecifically labeled bands were not recovered in the immunoprecipitate. The latter finding rules out precipitation of incompletely solubilized membrane fragments. It should be noted that the antibody to the C-terminal loop region of PS-1 also immunoprecipitated the 14-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 3 A,lane 3). Similar immunoprecipitation patterns were observed using HEK 293 cell membranes (data not shown). When membranes were extracted under conditions known to disrupt the PS-1 complex (in the presence of 1% SDS), the N-terminal PS-1 antibody immunoprecipitated only the 30-kDa band; likewise, the C-terminal antibody precipitated only the 20-kDa band (not shown). Large scale affinity purification was performed using the C-terminal PS-1 antibody or IgG derived from normal mouse serum bound to Sepharose (Fig. 3 B). The specifically cross-linked bands of 30, 25, and 20 kDa bound to and eluted from the anti PS-1 IgG column, but not normal mouse IgG column. The elution fractions of both columns were analyzed by fluorography (Fig. 3,B1), and by silver staining (Fig. 3, B2) followed by fluorography of the dried silver-stained gel (Fig. 3,B3). The 30- and 20-kDa silver-stained polypeptides were also positive in the fluorography. Moreover, immunoblotting analysis established that the 30-kDa band reacted with antibodies to the N terminus of PS-1 (Fig. 3, B4), whereas the 20-kDa band reacted with antibodies to the C terminus of PS-1 (Fig. 3,B5). It should be noted that traces of the 25-kDa polypeptide copurified with the PS-1 C-terminal antibody (Fig. 3,B1); however, this band was not detected by immunoblotting using N- or C-terminal PS-1 antibodies. These observations suggest that the 25-kDa band copurified with the PS-1 complex. The involvement of PS-1 in compound binding was confirmed in binding studies using membranes from PS-1 knock-out embryos (14De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. von Figura K. van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar). A gene dose-dependent reduction in binding was observed (Fig.4). It should be noted that even in the absence of PS-1 expression, residual specific binding of approximately 25% of the wild-type animals was observed. These results suggest that PS-1 is not the only binding site for the compounds under study. Incorporation of radioactivity into the 14-kDa band varied among several THP-1 and HEK 293 cell preparations. Based on the observed variability, this band was not a focus of this study.Figure 4Binding of labeled γ-secretase inhibitors to PS-1 knockout embryonic membranes. Embryos from PS-1 knockout mice were tested at E17–18. Whole embryos were homogenized in buffer (10% w/v), and membranes were prepared. The final pellet was resuspended in buffer at a protein concentration of approximately 8–10 mg/ml original wet weight. Radioligand binding assays were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” the ligand used was [3H]Compound D (86 Ci/mmol). Specific binding was determined using 0.064 μCi of [3H]Compound D and 300 nm Compound E to define nonspecific binding. Data are mean values of four animals for each group and are expressed as a percentage of specific binding observed in wild type embryos; ** indicatesp < 0.01 as determined by one-way analysis of variance and Dunnett's tests.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The involvement of PS-2 in binding and cross-linking was further analyzed (Fig. 5). Membranes from THP-1 cells were cross-linked and extracted as for the PS-1 experiments and analyzed by immunoprecipitation using antibodies to PS-2. The extract contained the major specifically labeled polypeptides of 30, 25, and 20 kDa (Fig. 5, lane 1). Immunoprecipitation with both N- and C-terminal specific polyclonal antibodies to PS-2 identified the 25-kDa fragment as PS-2 related (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3). Control immunoprecipitation experiments using normal rabbit IgG established that the immunoprecipitation was specific (Fig. 5,lane 4). The 25-kDa fragment was the only band specifically stained in THP-1 membrane extracts by immunoblotting using the PS-2 C-terminal antibody (not shown). Moreover, the 25-kDa band comigrated with the PS-2 C-terminal fragment derived by in vitrotranscription and translation of a 5′-truncated PS-2 cDNA (not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that potent and selective γ-secretase inhibitors block Aβ formation by binding to PS-1 and -2. The studies presented here provide evidence that the described small molecule γ-secretase inhibitors bind to PS-1 and PS-2. This conclusion is based on the molecular size of specifically labeled polypeptides, cross-linking to PS-1 and PS-2 as shown by immunoprecipitation with PS-1 and PS-2 specific antibodies, and reduced binding to membranes derived from PS-1 gene-targeted embryos. Compound C labels both N- and C-terminal PS-1 fragments with similar intensity. The photoaffinity ligand employed is monovalent, and the binding isotherms for THP-1 membranes are consistent with a single high affinity binding site. These results suggest that the compound is labeling an area of the PS-1 complex of close proximity of N- and C-terminal fragments. Interestingly, modeling studies suggest that two highly conserved Asp residues (Asp-257, Asp-385; PS-1 numbering) necessary for PS-1 and PS-2 function are in close proximity in adjacent transmembrane loops comprised of N- and C-terminal PS fragments (15Wolfe M.S.

The positive correlation between cellular potency and membrane binding suggests that the compounds can easily penetrate and possibly insert into the transmembrane domains of PS-1. If PS-1 itself is an aspartyl protease required for γ-secretase cleavage, it is tempting to speculate that these inhibitors bind in the transmembrane region near the putative catalytic site. It should be noted that Wolfe et al. (15Wolfe M.S. Zia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (1679) Google Scholar) suggested that the PS-1 holoprotein is a zymogen and requires proteolytic activation for biological activity. In this respect, we currently aim to address the question of whether cleavage of PS-1 and incorporation into the high molecular weight PS-1 complex are prerequisites for binding and cross-linking. In addition, the binding and cross-linking to PS-1 familial AD mutants are currently being analyzed. It should be noted that Compound A inhibits Aβ production in human fibroblasts derived from the familial AD A246E mutation followed transient transfection with βAPP. PS-1 and PS-2 are the major molecular target for this series of γ-secretase inhibitors. The 30- and 20-kDa specifically labeled polypeptides are, based on immunological characterization, N- and C-terminal PS-1 fragments. Moreover, the 25-kDa specifically cross-linked polypeptide was identified as the C-terminal fragment of PS-2. Interestingly, little if any labeling of the N-terminal fragment of PS-2 was observed. This result suggests that the compound binding pockets in PS-1 and PS-2 are distinct. The involvement of PS-2 in binding and cross-linking is consistent with the observation of residual specific binding to membranes derived from PS-1−/− animals. The compounds employed in this study completely blocked Aβ formation in mammalian cells,2whereas Aβ production in cells derived from PS-1 gene-targeted mice is reduced only by 50–70% (14De Strooper B. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Vanderstichele H. Guhde G. Annaert W. von Figura K. van Leuven F. Nature. 1998; 391: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (1544) Google Scholar), and no inhibition is observed in cells derived from single PS-2 knockout animals (24Herreman A. Hartman D. Annaert W. Saftig P. Craessaerts K. Serneels L. Umans L. Huylebroeck D. Zwijsen A. van Leuven F. De Strooper B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11872-11877Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Aβ was reported as undetectable in cells derived from both PS-1 and PS-2 double knockout animals. 3Herreman, A., Serneels, L., Annaert, W., Collen, D., Schoonjans, L., and De Strooper, B. (2000) Nat. Cell Biol. 2, 461–462. These results are consistent with binding of γ-secretase inhibitors to PS-1 and PS-2. In summary, the results of the present study further link the involvement of PS-1 and PS-2 to γ-secretase action since small molecule γ-secretase inhibitors bind to PS-1 and PS-2. These studies define PS-1 and PS-2 as the molecular target for γ-secretase inhibitors developed for the pharmacological treatment of AD."

Cyclin D1 is overexpressed in 20–30% of human breast tumors and is induced both by oncogenes including those for Ras, Neu, and Src, and by the β-catenin/lymphoid enhancer factor (LEF)/T cell factor (TCF) pathway. The ankyrin repeat containing serine-threonine protein kinase, integrin-linked kinase (ILK), binds to the cytoplasmic domain of β1 and β3integrin subunits and promotes anchorage-independent growth. We show here that ILK overexpression elevates cyclin D1 protein levels and directly induces the cyclin D1 gene in mammary epithelial cells. ILK activation of the cyclin D1 promoter was abolished by point mutation of a cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB)/ATF-2 binding site at nucleotide −54 in the cyclin D1 promoter, and by overexpression of either glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) or dominant negative mutants of CREB or ATF-2. Inhibition of the PI 3-kinase and AKT/protein kinase B, but not of the p38, ERK, or JNK signaling pathways, reduced ILK induction of cyclin D1 expression. ILK induced CREB transactivation and CREB binding to the cyclin D1 promoter CRE. Wnt-1 overexpression in mammary epithelial cells induced cyclin D1 mRNA and targeted overexpression of Wnt-1 in the mammary gland of transgenic mice increased both ILK activity and cyclin D1 levels.

ILK was first identified as a protein that binds to the cytoplasmic domain of the β1integrin subunit (28Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C.

The anchorage-independent growth induced by ILK overexpression is associated with the induction of cyclin D1 expression (33Radeva G. Petrocelli T. Behrend E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Filmus J.

Since cyclin D1 levels are reduced when cells become contact inhibited at higher density (34Galbiati F. Volonte D. Engelman J.A. Watanabe G. Burk R. Pestell R.G. Lisanti M.P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6633-6648Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar) and when cells are not anchored to the extracellular matrix (35Zhu X. Ohtsubo M. Bohmer R.M. Roberts J.M. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 391-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar), it is possible that the cyclin D1 gene is regulated by integrin and ILK-dependent signaling pathways. In this study, we show that activation of the Wnt pathway in transgenic mice is associated with induction of both ILK activity and cyclin D1 expression. ILK overexpression activated the cyclin D1 promoter through a CREB/ATF-2 binding site and involved the phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase/AKT pathway. ILK enhanced both CREB transactivation and binding of CREB to the cyclin D1 promoter CRE. GSK-3β inhibited ILK-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity and CREB binding to the cyclin D1 CRE. The identification of the cyclin D1 promoter as a direct target of ILK underscores a likely mechanism by which integrin signaling may enhance DNA synthesis.

Luciferase assays were performed at room temperature using an AutoLumat LB 953 (EG&G Berthold, Bad Wildbad, Germany). Luciferase content was measured by calculating the light emitted during the initial 10 s of the reaction, and the values are expressed in arbitrary light units (9Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C.

Statistical analyses were performed using the Mann-Whitney Utest with significant differences established as p < 0.05. The wild type CRE/ATF site of the cyclin D1 promoter, CD1CREwt, was synthesized as complementary oligodeoxyribonucleotide strands for EMSA (6Brown J.R. Nigh E. Lee R.J. Ye H. Thompson M.A. Saudou F.

The sequence of the cyclin D1 promoter CRE/ATF site oligodeoxyribonucleotide (CD1CREwt) was 5′-AAC AAC AGTAACGTCACA CGG AC-3′. EMSA were performed using nuclear extracts as described previously (32Troussard A.E. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and harvested by scraping in 1.5 ml of PBS. Cells were pelleted and resuspended in 400 μl of buffer A (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm PMSF). After 10 min of incubation on ice, nuclei were pelleted and then resuspended in 50 μl of buffer B (20 mm HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 25% glycerol, 420 mm sodium chloride, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mmPMSF). Proteins were incubated for 20 min on ice and then centrifuged to clear cellular debris. Gel shift assays were performed by incubating 2 μg of the nuclear extracts for 20 min at room temperature with the γ-32P-labeled oligonucleotides (50 fmol, 100,000 counts/min). The protein-DNA complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis through a 5% polyacrylamide gel, with 0.5× Tris borate, EDTA buffer (TBE: 0.045 m Tris borate, 0.001 m EDTA) and 3.5% glycerol at 180 V for 3–4 h. The specificity of the DNA-protein interaction was established by competition experiment and supershift assays as described (8Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G.

The gels were dried and exposed to autoradiographic film (Labscientific Inc., Livingston, NJ). The genotype of Wnt-1 transgenic mice was determined by isolating tail DNA and Southern blot hybridization with Wnt-1-labeled DNA probes as described previously (50Tsukamoto A.S. Grosschedl R.

Tissues from MMTV-Wnt-1 transgenic mice were homogenized by Dounce in lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1 mm PMSF, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (Sigma)), at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and protein concentrations were determined using a modified Bradford assay protocol (Bio-Rad). The supernatants (100 μg) were precipitated for 12 h at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads precoated with saturating amounts of the antibody. Immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.0), 10 mmMgCl2, 5 mm MnCl2, 1 mmDTT). The beads were then resuspended in 40 μl of kinase buffer containing the protein substrate (2 μg of myelin basic protein), 10 mm ATP, and 5 mCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol; 1 Ci = 37 GBq, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with occasional mixing. The samples were boiled in polyacrylamide gel sample buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate and separated by electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were quantified after exposure to autoradiographic film (Labscientific, Inc., Livingston, NJ) by densitometry using ImageQuant version 1.11 (Molecular Dynamics Computing Densitometer, Sunnyvale, CA). The abundance of cyclin D1 protein was determined by Western analysis as described previously (9Watanabe G. Lee R.J. Albanese C. Rainey W.E. Batlle D. Pestell R.G. J. Biol.

Cell homogenates (50 μg) were electrophoresed in an 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc., Westborough, MA). After transfer, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue as a control for blotting efficiency. The blotting membrane was incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in T-PBS buffer supplemented with 5% (w/v) dry milk to block nonspecific binding sites. Following a 6 h incubation with primary antibody at a 1:1000 dilution (cyclin D1) or 1:2500 (GDI) in T-PBS buffer containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, the membrane was washed with the same buffer. For detection of cyclin D1, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and washed again. The cyclin D1 protein was visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of ILK induces anchorage-independent growth and elevates cyclin D1 levels (33Radeva G. Petrocelli T. Behrend E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Filmus J. Slingerland J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13937-13944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). To determine whether ILK overexpression induces the cyclin D1 gene, transient expression studies were conducted in MCF7 cells. ILK overexpression induced the full-length cyclin D1 promoter linked to the luciferase reporter (−1745CD1LUC) by 4.5-fold (Fig. 1 A). Recent studies have shown GSK-3β is inhibited by induction of ILK signaling (32Troussard A.E. Tan C. Yoganathan T.N. Dedhar S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7420-7427Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Wild type ILK activates protein kinases B (PKB/AKT) and inhibits GSK-3β activity in a PI 3-kinase-dependent manner (31Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar). GSK-3β regulates several downstream signaling events, including the function of the CREB transcription factor (23Bullock B.P. Habener J.F.

This point mutation, shown to abolish binding of CREB/ATF-2 to the cyclin D1 promoter sequence (8Lee R.J. Albanese C. Stenger R.J. Watanabe G. Inghirami G. Haines III, G.K. Webster M. Muller W.J.

Point mutation of the TCF site did not affect regulation of the cyclin D1 promoter by wild type ILK (data not shown). The activation of the cyclin D1 promoter by ILK was specific as reporter plasmids containing the Rous sarcoma virus, cyclin A, and MMTV promoters, and the empty luciferase vector pA3LUC, were not induced by ILK overexpression (Fig.1 B). These results suggest that the CREB/ATF-2 binding site of the cyclin D1 promoter is required for its induction by ILK. To determine the intracellular signaling pathway(s) by which ILK induced cyclin D1 promoter activity, several chemical inhibitors and dominant negative expression vectors were employed. In these studies, the level of the cyclin D1 promoter activity in the presence of ILK was set as 100% (Fig. 2 A). The activity of ILK was previously linked to the PI 3-kinase pathway (31Delcommenne M. Tan C. Gray V. Rue L. Woodgett J. Dedhar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11211-11216Crossref PubMed Scopus (950) Google Scholar), and ILK contains a phosphoinositide binding motif (30Dedhar S. Williams B. Hannigan G.

The addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 to cells transfected with ILK and the cyclin D1 promoter reporter reduced the ILK-induced cyclin D1 promoter activity by 35% (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the basal activity of the cyclin D1 promoter in the absence of ILK expression was not inhibited by LY294002 (Fig. 2 B). These results are consistent with previous observations showing that the basal activity of the cyclin D1 promoter is"

The B1 and B2 amino-terminal fusion proteins competed with V-ATPase for binding to filamentous actin.

Tuukkanen J. Lakkakorpi P. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1305-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). V-ATPases in the ruffled membrane transport protons into the resorption compartment to create the acidic pH required for bone resorption. V-ATPases are also abundant on the plasma membrane of the kidney intercalated cell, which is responsible for hydrogen ion and bicarbonate transport in the cortical and outer medullary collecting duct (8Bastani B. Purcell H. Hemkin P. Trigg D. Gluck S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In the H+-secreting intercalated cells, V-ATPase is stored in a specialized intracellular tubulovesicular compartment, but is recruited rapidly to the apical plasma membrane in response to systemic administration of nonvolatile acid (8Bastani B. Purcell H. Hemkin P. Trigg D. Gluck S.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 9Tisher C.C. Madsen K.M. Verlander J.W. Contrib. Nephrol. 1991; 95: 168-177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The V-ATPase is composed of at least 13 subunits divided into two major domains, V1 and V0 (2Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). V1, which is composed of proteins peripheral to the membrane, contains the A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H subunits. The A and B subunits, which share homology with the α and β subunits of the ATP synthase, are thought to form a hexameric barrel of alternating subunits. The A subunit contains a site for ATP hydrolysis; in conjunction with the B subunit, it is thought to undergo a conformational change during ATP hydrolysis, which generates the force to turn an inner rotating “cam” composed of multiple subunits other than A and B (2Forgac M. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 71-80Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Rotation of the cam is thought to drive proton movement through the V0 domain. Apart from its putative function in ATPase activity, the function of the B subunit is unknown. There are two isoforms of the B subunit encoded by different genes. The B2 “brain” isoform is expressed ubiquitously (5Gluck S.L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 137C: 105-137PubMed Google Scholar), and at high levels in osteoclasts (10Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Ojikutu B. Krits I. Gluck S.L. Am. J.

The distribution of the B1 “kidney” isoform is more restricted. It is found at high levels in intercalated cells of the kidney (11Nelson R.D. Guo X.-L. Masood K. Brown D. Kalkbrenner M. Gluck S.L.

Cytochem. 1999; 47: 1247-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The difference in the expression of these isoforms suggests that the B subunit may function in V-ATPase regulation. Recent studies indicate the cytoskeleton has an important role in V-ATPase regulation in the osteoclast (18Abu-amer Y. Ross F.P. Schlesinger P. Tondravi M.M. Teitelbaum S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Nakamura et al. (19Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) showed that V-ATPase was associated with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton in bone marrow-derived osteoclasts from normal mice. In contrast, in the oc−/oc−“osteosclerotic” mouse, which has severe bone deformities due to abnormal osteoclast bone resorption, osteoclasts appeared to lack V-ATPase association with the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton, and were unable to transport V-ATPase to the ruffled membranes (19Nakamura I. Takahashi N. Udagawa N. Moriyama Y. Kurokawa T. Jimi E. Sasaki T. Suda T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These results suggest that interactions between the osteoclast V-ATPase and the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton are essential for recruitment of V-ATPase to the ruffled membrane, and for normal bone resorption. We have identified a potential mechanism for the interaction between the osteoclast V-ATPase and the cytoskeleton, a direct binding interaction between the V-ATPase and F-actin (1Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). V-ATPase and F-actin were shown to co-localize in detergent-solubilized osteoclast remnants, and actin and myosin II were immunoprecipitated from detergent extracts of osteoclasts using a monoclonal antibody against the E subunit of V-ATPase. This association correlated with transport of V-ATPase to ruffled membranes. We were able to reconstitute binding using purified V-ATPase and F-actin and reported that pure osteoclast and bovine kidney V-ATPase bound filamentous actin with high affinity (K d = 55 nm). Examination of bovine kidney V-ATPase bound to F-actin under the electron microscope suggested binding occurred through a region of the V1domain that is farthest removed from the membrane insertion site. Because we isolated myosin II in complex with F-actin and V-ATPase, but not other myosins, we suggested that myosin II-powered contraction of a microfilament network transported bound V-ATPase to the site of nascent ruffled membranes (1Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This model is consistent with the findings in oc−/oc− mice, and also with a report that microinjection of myosin II-inhibiting antibodies into osteoclasts greatly decreased their bone resorptive capacity (20Sato M. Grasser W. Cell Motil. Cytoskel. 1990; 17: 250-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although our previous studies showed that V-ATPase interacts directly with actin filaments, we were unable to distinguish which of the 13 subunits of V-ATPase bound F-actin. In this study we identify an F-actin binding site in the amino-terminal domain of the B subunit as a strong candidate for mediating the binding of V-ATPase to F-actin. Materials were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise noted. Osteoclasts were generated from primary mouse marrow cultures (21Holliday L.S. Dean A.D. Greenwald J.E. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18983-18989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Swiss Webster mice (8–20 g each) were killed by cervical dislocation, and femora and tibia were isolated. Marrow was flushed from the bone cavity and grown at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on tissue culture plates in α-minimum Eagle's medium + 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 for 6 to 8 days. V-ATPase was obtained from mouse marrow cultures as described previously (1Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures were labeled overnight in 90% methionine- and cysteine-free culture medium containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 50 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and solubilized in Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 5 mm sodium azide, and protease inhibitors). Following centrifugation at low speed (10 min at 20,000 × g, 4 °C) to remove insoluble material, the extracts were used for immunoprecipitation, which was performed by first incubating the extracts with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to clear nonspecifically bound proteins. Extracts were then incubated with 10 μl of the anti-V-ATPase E-subunit monoclonal antibody E11 ascites (22Hemkin P. Guo X.-L. Wang Z.-Q. Zhang K. Gluck S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9948-9957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 2 h at 4 °C, and with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for an additional 30 min. The immune complexes were pelleted in a microcentrifuge, washed three times in NET-GEL buffer (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 18Google Scholar), and eluted with 5 mg/ml E11 target peptide in F-buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mmdithiothreitol). The eluate was dialyzed overnight against F-buffer. Under these conditions the V-ATPase partially disassociated. The capacity of partially disassociated osteoclast V-ATPase to bind actin was tested by adding 4.5 μm rabbit muscle F-actin to these V-ATPase preparations. After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, the F-actin was pelleted at 200,000 × gfor 45 min, pellets and supernatants were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and they were analyzed by autoradiography and/or phosphorimaging as described previously (1Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Bovine kidney V-ATPase and bovine microsomes were prepared as described previously (24Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All procedures were performed at 4 °C. 5 mg/ml microsomal protein was solubilized in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.6 mm CHAPS, 1.5%n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside, and 10% glycerol. The mixture was centrifuged at 150,000 × gfor 1 h, and the clear supernatant containing solubilized V-ATPase was collected. Immunoaffinity purification of V-ATPase from bovine kidney was performed exactly as described (24Gluck S. Caldwell J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15780-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit muscle acetone powder by standard methods (25Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and was further purified by two rounds of polymerization-depolymerization and gel filtration on a 2.5 × 100-cm Sephacryl S-300 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). F-actin blot overlays were performed by a modification of the method of Luna (26Luna E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rabbit muscle actin was polymerized in a buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm ATP and incubated with sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) at a molar ratio of 1:20 for 30 min at room temperature. The biotinylated F-actin was depolymerized by dialysis into buffer G (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm DTT). The depolymerized, biotinylated F-actin was spun at 100,000 × g for 45 min and mixed at a 1:10 ratio with unlabeled, unpolymerized actin. The mix was polymerized by addition of 100 mm NaCl and 5 mmMgCl2 (buffer F) in the presence of 1 mol of gelsolin/25 mol of actin. The polymerized F-actin was stabilized with 10 μm phalloidin. Immunopurified bovine kidney V-ATPase (0.2 μg/lane) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and probed with 100 μg/ml biotinylated F-actin in buffer F plus 0.5% Tween 20, 10 μm phalloidin, and 5 mg/ml BSA for 2 h at room temperature. The blots were washed in the same buffer and probed in the same buffer plus 1 μg/ml alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin for 30 min, washed three times for 10 min in the same buffer, and alkaline phosphatase was detected using a standard substrate containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium in 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. As a control, some V-ATPase blots were incubated with 1 mg/ml unlabeled, gelsolin-capped F-actin together with 100 μg/ml biotinylated gelsolin-capped F-actin. Quantitation was by densitometry using a Fluorchem 8000 in reflectance mode (Alpha Innatech Corp., San Leandro, CA). To localize the domain in the B1 subunit of V-ATPase responsible for interaction with F-actin, we generated two B1 subunit-GST fusion constructs by ligating in frame DNA fragments corresponding to B1 subunit amino acids 1–268 or 249–513 with the GST gene in pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A construct containing the entire coding region of the E subunit of V-ATPase ligated in frame with the GST gene was used as a negative control. Bacteria containing the recombinant plasmids were cultured in LB medium, induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, lysed by sonication, and incubated with glutathione beads (Sigma). The GST fusion proteins were purified and verified as described (27Zhang N. Shen W. Hawley R.G. Lu M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2273-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). To construct the NH2-terminal B1 subunit maltose-binding protein fusion protein (NT-B1-MBP), we amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) a 329-base pair DNA fragment encoding the amino-terminal 106 amino acids from human B1 using the sense and antisense primers 5′-ATGGCCATGGAGATAGACAGCAGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAGCAAGTGGTCTTCC-3′ with a human B1 subunit cDNA clone as the template. The same strategy was used to construct a fusion protein containing the amino-terminal 112 residues from human B2 (NT-B2-MBP). A 347-base pair DNA fragment was amplified by PCR using the sense and antisense primers 5′-ATGGCGCTGCGGGCGATGCGGGGG-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGACTAACAGGACGTTTTCTT-3′ with a human B2 subunit cDNA clone as the template. 200 pmol each of the sense and antisense primers were added to 100 ng of cDNA template in 50 mm KCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1.0% Triton X-100, and 0.2 mm dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP. PCR was carried out for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 50 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR product was ligated into the vector pMALc (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Colonies of XL-1 Blue Escherichia coli (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), transformed with the ligation products, were selected for inducible expression of the fusion proteins with 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Inducible products with predicted sizes of 54,000 and 55,000 for B1 and B2, respectively, were demonstrable by SDS-PAGE analysis of whole cell extracts. Each fusion protein construct was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing. The fusion proteins were purified on amylose columns, using protocols supplied by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Homogeneity was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE, and the products were further confirmed by proteolytic cleavage of the fusion protein using factor Xa, which cleaves a site just amino-terminal to the first residue of the B subunit-derived portion. The B subunit peptides were separated from maltose-binding protein by SDS-PAGE on 17% bisacrylamide gels, electroblotted to Immobilon P (Pierce), and the amino-terminal 20 amino acids were sequenced by Edman degradation (Protein Chemistry Core Facility, Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research, University of Florida). GST fusion proteins were precipitated with glutathione beads from bacterial extracts (26Luna E.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 32-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and were washed in buffer F. Actin (70 μM) was polymerized in buffer F, prespun at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and diluted to 1 μm in buffer F. 100 μl of the diluted F-actin was mixed with 25 μl of GST beads containing bound GST fusion protein. The mix was incubated with agitation for 25 min at room temperature, and the beads were pelleted by centrifugation at 200 × g for 1 min. The supernatants were collected and beads were washed in 1 ml of buffer F, and pelleted at 5,000 × g for 1 min. The wash procedure was repeated three times, and proteins were solubilized from the beads using SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The initial unbound material and the proteins that bound the beads after washing were subjected to SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie stain. The affinity and stoichiometry of NT-B1-MBP and NT-B2-MBP for actin was determined by quantitative binding assays. Protein concentrations of actin and the fusion proteins were determined by BCA assay (Pierce). Purified rabbit muscle actin was polymerized at a concentration of 70 μm in buffer F, and diluted in F-buffer immediately prior to the experimental procedure. F-actin alone (0.8 μm) or F-actin plus varying concentrations of fusion protein dialyzed against F-buffer were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 200,000 ×g for 45 min, and pellets and supernatants were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie Blue, and the amounts of fusion protein in the supernatants and pellets were determined by absorbance densitometry using a Fluorchem 8000. Bovine kidney V-ATPase in PBS was biotinylated with NHS-LC-biotin at a molar ratio of 2.5 mol of biotin/mol of V-ATPase for 30 min at room temperature. The biotinylated V-ATPase was then dialyzed into buffer F. Actin (0.8 μm) was polymerized in the same buffer and pre-incubated with 1.0 μm NT-B1-MBP and 1.0 μm NT-B2-MBP, or 1 μm MBP as a control, for 45 min. Biotinylated V-ATPase (0.05 μm) was then added, and the mix, or actin alone as a control, was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g for 45 min, supernatants and pellets were collected, and the proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12.5% acrylamide gels. Some samples were electroblotted to nitrocellulose, and biotinylated protein was detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin, which was detected using a standard substrate containing 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium in 2-amino-2-methyl-1,3-propanediol. Quantitation of total biotinylated protein was performed by reflectance densitometry using a Fluorchem 8000. V-ATPase was immunoprecipitated from the low speed supernatants of metabolically labeled, osteoclast-containing mouse marrow cultures using the monoclonal anti-E subunit antibody, E11 (Fig.1, lane 1). V-ATPase isolated by this method is enriched in the A, B, and E subunits and has associated F-actin and myosin II (1Lee B.S. Gluck S.L. Holliday L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29164-29171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). It also contains subunits C, D, and c, and is capable of bafilomycin-sensitive ATPase activity (28Lee B.S. Holliday L.S. Krits T. Gluck S.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1999; 14: 2127-2136Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We do not detect the a subunit by this method. The complexes were eluted by competition with the E11 target peptide and dialyzed overnight in a buffer containing physiologic salt, magnesium, and ATP. We have observed previously that this treatment induced partial disassembly of the V-ATPase. 2B. S. Lee, S. L. Gluck, and L. S. Holliday, unpublished observations. After overnight dialysis, the complexes were supplemented with rabbit muscle actin (Fig. 1, lane 2) to ensure that F-actin was present in excess, and subjected to ultracentrifugation. The resulting supernatants (Fig. 1, lane 3) and pellets (Fig.1, lane 4) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 95.7% of the actin (by phosphorimaging) and 96.2% of the B subunit pelleted under these conditions, but only 63.4% of A subunit and 5.1% of E subunit were detected (Fig. 1, lane 4). In this procedure, only trace amounts of other subunits were detected. The simplest explanation for this result is that the B subunit bound F-actin, and other subunits were recovered in the pellet only when complexed with the B subunit. F-actin overlays were used as a second and independent method for identifying actin-binding sites on the V-ATPase. Bovine kidney V-ATPase was separated by SDS-PAGE, and electroblotted to Immobilon P. The blots were probed with biotinylated, phalloidin-stabilized F-actin, and detected using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated streptavidin (Fig.2). The biotinylated F-actin bound only the two B subunit isoforms of the bovine kidney V-ATPase (Fig. 2,lanes 4 and 5). Co-incubation of blots with biotinylated F-actin together with an excess of unlabeled F-actin reduced binding by biotinylated-F-actin by 82% (Fig. 2,lane 7). The ability of F-actin to specifically bind B subunit in blot overlay experiments provided a second line of evidence that the B subunit contains a binding site for F-actin. In order to study interaction between V-ATPase and F-actin in greater detail, we constructed GST fusion proteins containing the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the B1 isoform of the B subunit (NT-B1-GST, CT-B1-GST) and full-length E subunit (E-GST), depicted in Fig.3 A. Mixtures of these fusion proteins with phalloidin-stabilized F-actin (1.0 μm) were assayed by precipitation with glutathione beads (Fig. 3 B). No actin was detected associated with beads coated either with CT-B1-GST or E-GST (Fig. 3 B, lanes 4and 6). In contrast, a large amount of actin bound the NT-B1-GST coated beads (Fig. 3 B, lane 2). On the basis of these data, we identified the amino terminus of the B subunit as the most likely location for the actin-binding site that mediates the high affinity interaction between V-ATPase and F-actin. We made additional fusion proteins incorporating the amino-terminal 106 and 112 amino acids of the B1 and B2 isoforms, respectively (NT-B1-MBP; NT-B2-MBP) using a maltose-binding protein expression system to guard against possible GST-related artifacts (depicted in Fig.4 A). Each fusion protein, or unaltered MBP as a control, was subjected to ultracentrifugation either alone, or in a mixture with F-actin (Fig. 4 B). The fusion proteins pelleted with F-actin (Fig. 4 B, lanes 5–12), whereas purified MBP did not (Fig. 4 B,lanes 1–4). These results indicate that an actin binding site is located within the first 112 amino acid residues of the amino terminus of the B subunit. The fusion proteins prepared using the MBP vector contain a factor Xa cleavage site preceding the first amino acid of the B subunit-derived peptide chain. To determine if the actin binding was the result of interaction between the amino-terminal peptide and F-actin, we examined the effect on actin binding of cleavage of NT-B1 with factor Xa (Fig.4 C). Intact or cleaved NT-B1-MBP was mixed with F-actin, and binding was assayed by ultracentrifugation (Fig. 4 C). The NT-B1 peptides bound F-actin, but binding of MBP was lost after cleavage with factor Xa. Similar results were obtained using cleaved NT-B2-MBP (data not shown). These results confirmed that binding of the fusion proteins was mediated through the B subunit peptides, rather than MBP. The binding of the B1- and B2-MBP fusion proteins to F-actin was characterized in more detail (Fig. 5). Saturation was approached by both NT-B1-MBP and NT-B2-MBP at a 1:1 stoichiometry (1 mol of fusion protein:1 mol of F-actin subunit; Fig.5, A and B). Using this stoichiometry, dissociation constants were determined from Haines plots (Fig. 5,C and D). Both fusion proteins bound F-actin with high affinity; the K d of NT-B1-MBP binding was 130 nm, and the K d of NT-B2-MBP binding was 190 nm. Finally, to test whether the interaction of intact V-ATPase with F-actin was mediated through the B subunit, we incubated saturating levels of NT-B1-MBP and NT-B2-MBP with F-actin for 30 min, and then added biotinylated-V-ATPase. After an additional 30 min, the mixtures were centrifuged. The supernatants and pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to nitrocellulose, and the bi"
https://openalex.org/W1965481505,"Respiration of Escherichia colicatalyzed either by cytochrome bo′ or bd is sensitive to micromolar extracellular NO; extensive, transient inhibition of respiration increases as dissolved oxygen tension in the medium decreases. At low oxygen concentrations (25–33 μm), the duration of inhibition of respiration by 9 μm NO is increased by mutation of either oxidase. Respiration of an hmp mutant defective in flavohemoglobin (Hmp) synthesis is extremely NO-sensitive (I50 about 0.8 μm); conversely, cells pre-grown with sodium nitroprusside or overexpressing plasmid-bornehmp + are insensitive to 60 μm NO and have elevated levels of immunologically detectable Hmp. Purified Hmp consumes O2 at a rate that is instantaneously and extensively (>10-fold) stimulated by NO due to NO oxygenase activity but, in the absence of NO, Hmp does not contribute measurably to cell oxygen consumption. Cyanide binds to Hmp (K d 3 μm). Concentrations of KCN (100 μm) that do not significantly inhibit cell respiration markedly suppress the protection of respiration from NO afforded by Hmp and abolish NO oxygenase activity of purified Hmp. The results demonstrate the role of Hmp in protecting respiration from NO stress and are discussed in relation to the energy metabolism of E. coli in natural O2-depleted environments. Respiration of Escherichia colicatalyzed either by cytochrome bo′ or bd is sensitive to micromolar extracellular NO; extensive, transient inhibition of respiration increases as dissolved oxygen tension in the medium decreases. At low oxygen concentrations (25–33 μm), the duration of inhibition of respiration by 9 μm NO is increased by mutation of either oxidase. Respiration of an hmp mutant defective in flavohemoglobin (Hmp) synthesis is extremely NO-sensitive (I50 about 0.8 μm); conversely, cells pre-grown with sodium nitroprusside or overexpressing plasmid-bornehmp + are insensitive to 60 μm NO and have elevated levels of immunologically detectable Hmp. Purified Hmp consumes O2 at a rate that is instantaneously and extensively (>10-fold) stimulated by NO due to NO oxygenase activity but, in the absence of NO, Hmp does not contribute measurably to cell oxygen consumption.

Rep. 1999; 19: 133-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Microbiologically, NO is important as an intermediate in denitrification (4Watmough N.J. Butland G. Cheesman M.R. Moir J.W.B.

Clin. Infect. Dis. 1995; 21: S162-S165Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). NO and redox-related species such as the nitrosonium cation (NO+) and the nitroxyl ion (NO−) (6Hughes M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) are reactive with many key biomolecules including iron proteins (7Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys.

NO is a well established and experimentally useful ligand for heme proteins; its reactions with globins and oxidases from diverse higher organisms have been extensively investigated but assumed to have little physiological significance (10Yoshikawa T. Ohya-Nishiguchi H. Packer L. Bioradicals Detected by ESR Spectroscopy. Birkhauser Verlag, Basel1995: 217-235Crossref Google Scholar). Recently, however, the hemoglobin-NO reaction has been shown to regulate the chemistry of NO and maintain it in a circulating bioactive state (11Gow A.J. Luchsinger B.P. Pawloski J.R. Singel D.J. Stamler J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9027-9032Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Reaction of NO with the mitochondrial terminal oxidase, cytochromeaa 3, has been shown to involve not only the O2-binding heme (cytochrome a 3) but also the copper atom (CuB) (8Torres J. Wilson M.T.

E. coli does not have cytochromeaa 3 but synthesizes two other major respiratory quinol oxidases, cytochromes bo′ and bd (13Gennis R.B. Stewart V. Niedhardt F.C. Curtiss III, R. Ingraham J.L.

Cytochrome bo′ is structurally and functionally homologous to mitochondrial cytochrome aa 3 and binds two molecules of NO at CuB (15Butler C.S. Seward H.E. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 16259-16266Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cytochrome bdreacts with nitrite and trioxodinitrate to form a spectrally distinctive nitrosyl complex (16Hubbard J.A.M. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K.

Since cytochromes bo′and bd have distinct structures and catalytic properties, including sensitivity to cyanide (14Poole R.K. Cook G.M. Adv.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), in which NO inhibits oxygen consumption by cytochrome aa3 but not by the cyanide-insensitive, non-phosphorylating, alternative oxidase. To date only the respiration of Escherichia coli possessing both oxidases has been shown to be inhibited by NO (20Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). E. coli responds at the level of gene expression to NO, NO-releasing agents, and nitrosating compounds in at least two ways. Nunoshiba et al. (21Nunoshiba T. DeRojas T. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R.

However, the physiological function(s) of this system in resisting NO is unclear. Second, NO, nitrite, the nitrosating compound sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) are potent inducers ofhmp gene expression in E. coli (22Poole R.K. Anjum M.F.

Kim S.O. Hughes M.N. Stewart V. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5487-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) to detoxify NO. Recent studies support this proposal: mutants carrying a poorly defined deletion in the glnB-hmpregion of the genome are more sensitive to growth inhibition by NO than are control strains (25Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Such mutants are also unable to catalyze NAD(P)H-dependent NO consumption (25Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Unequivocal evidence that the hmp gene itself is responsible for aerobic resistance to NO and nitrosative stress has come from construction of genetically defined hmp mutants. An E. coli K12hmp mutant (RKP4545) was shown to be hypersensitive to killing by GSNO and SNP (27Membrillo-Hernández J. Coopamah M.D. Anjum M.F. Stevanin T.M. Kelly A. Hughes M.N. Poole R.K. J. Biol.

NO is proposed to attack oxygenated Hmp (Fe(III)-O2) to form the relatively innocuous nitrate ion (25Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) may explain the protective effects of Hmp observed during anaerobic or microaerobic growth (25Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar) and may be of greater importance in natural environments of E. coli, including the gut (31Poole R.K. Ingledew W.J. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium-Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 170-200Google Scholar). Thus, Hmp, a member of the ancient globin family, plays key roles in resisting NO in several bacteria and probably other microorganisms (32Poole R.K. Hughes M.N. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 36: 775-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). The aim of this work was to determine the sensitivity to NO of respiration catalyzed by each of the major respiratory oxidases ofE. coli, cytochromes bo′ and bd. We show that NO inhibits both oxidases but that expression and activity of Hmp provides effective protection in vivo. Since the natural environment of E. coli in the gut is microaerobic (31Poole R.K. Ingledew W.J. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium-Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1987: 170-200Google Scholar), where NO inhibition of respiration is maximal (Ref. 20Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M.

Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). An improved purification protocol was used for the Hmp employed in the experiment shown in Fig. 7. 2C. E. Mills, S. Sedelnikova, B. Søballe, M. N. Hughes, and R. K. Poole, submitted for publication.Enzyme concentration was measured from spectra of the native (ferric) enzyme using the absorption coefficients described by Ioannidiset al. (37Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Rabbits were administered subcutaneous injections with a homogeneous mixture (250 μl) of 2.7 mg of purified Hmp in Freund's complete adjuvant. Subsequently, two booster injections of similar composition were administered at 3 and 7 weeks, respectively, after the first injection. At the end of the procedure, rabbits were sacrificed, and bled out for serum. E. coli cells were disrupted by ultrasonication using an MSE/Sanyo Soniprep 150 sonicator delivering three 30-s periods at full power, with 30-s cooling intervals. Extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 132,000 × g for 1.5 h at 4 °C and used in Western blots (39Renart J. Sandoval I.V. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar); detection was done using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cells were grown for 6 h as above untilA 600 reached approximately 1.4. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed in 0.9% sterile saline, and resuspended in 5 ml of buffer containing HEPES (50 mm, pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, and 1 mm each of MgCl2, NaH2PO4, d-glucose, and CaCl2 (20Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). A Clark-type polarographic oxygen electrode system (Rank Bros., Bottisham, Cambridge, UK) was used comprising a water-jacketed (37 °C) Perspex chamber stirred magnetically; the membrane-covered electrode was situated at the bottom of the chamber below the stirrer. About 25–50 μl of cell suspension was diluted in the chamber with buffer to give a working volume of 2 ml and a close-fitting lid, with a fine hole for injections using a Hamilton syringe, was inserted. The suspension was further supplemented with glucose (10 μm final concentration) and respiration rates measured in the closed system. Additions of anoxic, NO-saturated solutions were made in the same way. The electrode was calibrated with air-equilibrated water (taken to contain 220 μmO2) and on adding sodium dithionite to achieve anoxia. The above oxygen electrode system was modified to permit simultaneous measurements of O2 and NO consumption.2 Briefly, the chamber top was sealed with a Perspex cap having a concave bottom surface and drilled with a central vertical hole (6 mm in diameter to a depth of approximately 33 mm, and 2.5 mm diameter for the remaining 11-mm depth) to accept an ISO-NOP2 stainless steel shielded NO electrode of 2-mm diameter (World Precision Instruments). The electrode shaft was fitted with a plastic sleeve to hold the membrane at the required depth in the chamber. A second vertical hole (approximately 1.5-mm diameter, 44-mm depth) near the cap perimeter permitted addition of solutions of NADH, enzymes, and NO. Current from the O2 electrode was amplified and displayed on a two-channel recorder, along with the amplified current of the NO electrode (polarizing voltage of 0.865 V) processed using a World Precision Instruments ISO-NO Mark II Isolated Nitric Oxide Meter. Experiments with purified Hmp were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm MOPS and 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.0. Spectra for determining the cytochrome composition of mutant strains were obtained using an SDB-4 dual-wavelength scanning spectrophotometer (University of Pennsylvania Biomedical Instrumentation Group, and Current Designs Inc., Philadelphia, PA) (40Kalnenieks U. Galinina N. Bringer-Meyer S. Poole R.K. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 168: 91-97PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were centrifuged from stationary phase cultures, suspended in 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and used to record dithionite-reduced minuspersulfate-oxidized difference spectra or CO + dithioniteminus dithionite difference spectra (41Poole R.K. Kalnenieks U. Gore M. Spectrophotometry and Spectrofluorimetry: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 1-32Google Scholar). Spectral data were analyzed and plotted using SoftSDB (Current Designs Inc.) and CA-Cricket Graph III software. To assess the presence or absence of cytochrome o′, photodissociation spectra (photolysed,i.e. reduced minus unphotolysed, i.e.CO-ligated) were obtained at −100 °C in the above apparatus (42Søballe B. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1998; 144: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Purified Hmp is largely in the ferric state (37Ioannidis N. Cooper C.E. Poole R.K. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Protein (final concentration typically 3–4 μm) was incubated in 1 ml of 50 mm MOPS/NaOH buffer, pH 7.0, containing 50 μm potassium ferricyanide to ensure complete conversion to the ferric form. Cyanide was added as a solution of NaCN, adjusted to pH 7.0, to give the final concentrations shown under “Results” and the samples (1 ml final volume) incubated at 4 °C overnight. Transition of the high-spin form to the low-spin cyanide complex was measured as ΔA at 423–387 nm. Among the many possible targets for the cellular toxic effects of NO and related reactive species, respiratory heme enzymes are prime candidates (8Torres J. Wilson M.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1411: 310-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 12Torres J. Cooper C.E. Sharpe M. Wilson M.T. J. Bioenerg. Biomem. 1998; 30: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 19Millar A.H. Day D.A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 398: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Yu et al. (20Yu H. Sato E.F. Nagata K. Nishikawa M. Kashiba M. Arakawa T. Kobayashi K. Tamura T. Inoue M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) have shown that respiration of E. coli is also sensitive to NO in an O2-dependent fashion, with inhibition increasing as O2 tension decreases. Since whole cell respiration in the range of O2 tensions used in that study has contributions from the activity of both cytochromes bo′ and bd, each having a k m for O2 in the submicromolar range (43D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 867-870Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44D'mello R. Hill S. Poole R.K. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), we tested separately the NO sensitivity of cytochrome bo′- and cytochrome bd-mediated respiration. A set of isogenic strains was used in which either cytochrome bd (strain AN2343, cydD) or bo′ (strain RKP4544,cyo) was absent. The phenotype of the strains was confirmed by room temperature absorption difference spectroscopy (cydD) or low temperature photodissociation spectroscopy (cyo); in the latter case absence of the characteristic 415/430 nm Soret bands of cytochrome o′ was confirmed (not shown). Strain AN2342 is a wild-type strain having both oxidases. Injection of NO solutions to respiring cell suspensions immediately inhibited oxygen uptake but the degree of inhibition was strongly dependent on the oxygen tension in the reaction chamber at the time of NO addition (Fig. 1 A). Thus, when 9 μm (final concentration) NO was added to a respiring cell suspension in which the O2 concentration was 33 μm (bottom trace), inhibition of respiration was virtually instantaneous and the residual respiration rate was only about 4% of the control value. After about 3 min, respiration resumed at a rate that slightly exceeded the initial rate and proceeded linearly until the oxygen in the chamber was depleted, reflecting the high oxygen affinities of the oxidases. However, when NO was added at successively higher dissolved O2 tensions, the extent of inhibition markedly decreased (e.g. to 25% of the control rate at 132 μm O2) and the period of inhibition was decreased. Qualitatively similar results were obtained with strain RKP4544 (cyo, not shown) and strain AN2343 (cydD, Fig. 1 B), although in both of these strains the period of respiratory inhibition at low O2tensions (25–33 μm) was always significantly greater than in the wild-type strain (Fig.2 A). Thus total respiratory capacity, rather than the properties of individual oxidases, may be the main determinant of NO inhibition of respiration at low oxygen tensions. At a fixed O2 concentration, the period of inhibition by NO was dose-dependent (shown for the wild-type strain only in Fig. 2 B). In view of the marked effects of O2 tension on the NO sensitivity of cell respiration, in subsequent experiments NO was added at predetermined O2 tensions, which are indicated on Figs.3, 4, and 5.Figure 3Sensitivity of respiratory oxygen consumption in an hmp mutant. Measurements of respiration of washed cell suspensions of E. coli strain RKP4545 (hmp) were made in an oxygen electrode apparatus. InA, a solution of NO was added at the arrows to give a final concentration in each case of 9 μm NO. The O2 concentration (μm) at the point of each addition is shown alongside each addition. The uninhibited respiration rate in each trace was 58 nmol of O2 consumed per min/mg of cell protein. The dashed lines in thetop trace in A shows the method of calculation of the period of inhibition. In B, lower concentrations of NO (2.5, 1.0, and 0.5 μm, top to bottom) were titrated to the cell suspension, and the initial inhibition is shown. The O2 concentration (μm) at each addition was 60 μm; traces are offset for clarity. C shows the inhibition of respiration, calculated from the steady state respiration rate immediately after addition of NO relative to the rate immediately before addition of the NO solution, as a function of NO concentration.

Unilateral cholinergic cell ablation caused an acute abnormal turning behavior. These mice showed gradual recovery but displayed abnormal turning by both excess stimulation and inhibition of dopamine actions. In the acute phase, basal ganglia function was shifted to a hyperactive state by stimulation and suppression of striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively. D1 and D2 dopamine receptors were then down-regulated, relieving dopamine-predominant synaptic perturbation but leaving a defect in controlling dopamine responses. The acetylcholine-dopamine interaction is concertedly and adaptively regulated for basal ganglia synaptic integration."

After converting Sup35p to its prion conformation in vitro, we introduced it into the cytoplasm of living yeast using a liposome transformation protocol. Introduction of substoichiometric quantities of converted Sup35p greatly increased the rate of appearance of the well-characterized epigenetic factor [ PSI + ], which results from self-propagating aggregates of cellular Sup35p. Thus, as predicted by the prion hypothesis, proteins can act as infectious agents by causing self-propagating conformational changes."

The enzymes of polyphosphoinositide turnover occur in the nucleus of mammalian cells and yeast as well (Ref. references therein),and there is evidence for phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) synthesis and degradation in the nuclear matrix (2Chi T.H. Crabtree G.R. Science. 2000; 281: 1937-1939Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Payrastre B. Nievers M. Boonstra J. Breton M. Verkleij A.J. van Bergen en Henegouwen P.M.P. J. Biol.

The evidence obtained with confocal and electron microscope analysis indicates that enzymes required for the synthesis and hydrolysis of phosphoinositides are localized at ribonucleoprotein structures of the inner nuclear matrix involved in transcript processing within the interchromatin domains (4Maraldi N.M. Zini N. Santi S. Manzoli F.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1999; 181: 203-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Although phosphatidylinositol cycle is activated only in nuclei from HeLa cells in S phase (5York J.D. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7847-7850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), striking changes occur mainly in PLCβ1 activity a few minutes after growth factor stimulation (1Cocco L. Capitani S. Maraldi N.M. Mazzotti G. Barnabei O. Rizzoli R. Gilmour R.S. Wirtz K.W.A. Rhee S.G. Manzoli F.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1998; 38: 351-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). PLCβ1 is composed of two subtypes, 150-kDa PLCβ1a and 140-kDa PLCβ1b, that are derived from a single gene by alternative RNA splicing (6Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8240-8245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two forms of the PLCβ1 are detectable both in cytosolic and nuclear fractions although PLCβ1b exists almost entirely in the nucleus (7Bahk Y.Y. Song H. Baek S.H. Park B.Y. Kim H. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 76-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), and the β1a form localizes in equal amount in nuclei and plasma membrane (8Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Previous investigations from our group have demonstrated that the nucleus-confined PLCβ1 is directly involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of Friend erythroleukemia cells even in the presence of inducers of erythroid differentiation, possibly due to a continuous stimulation of the cell cycle (9Matteucci A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Peruzzi D. Bavelloni A. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5057-5060PubMed Google Scholar). With the above in mind, we sought to explore whether PLCβ1 is actually involved in the regulation of cell cycle machinery. In mammalian cells, proliferation is under the control of factors that regulate the transition between different cell cycle stages at two main checkpoints. The better described checkpoint is at the G1-S phase transition for initiation and completion of DNA replication in S phase. The other checkpoint is at the G2-M phase transition and controls mitosis and cell division (10Murray A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 872-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The cell cycle is primarily regulated by a family of structurally related serine/threonine protein kinases, which consist of a regulatory subunit, a cyclin, and a catalytic subunit, a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk). In mammalian cells, cdk4 or cdk6, in combination with the D type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3), and cdk2 in association with cyclin E play key roles in regulating G1 progression (Ref. 11Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar and references therein). Furthermore, overexpression of E or D type cyclins is able to accelerate the transition through the G1 phase of the cell cycle (12Ohtsubo M. Roberts J. Science. 1993; 259: 1908-1912Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that the primarily function of D-type cyclins is to stimulate progression through G1, rather than to promote the G1/S transition. In addition it appears that in hematopoietic cell lines, overexpression of cyclin D2 or D3 prevents granulocyte differentiation, whereas overexpression of cyclin D1, which is normally not expressed in those cells, does not (13Kato J. Sherr C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 9: 11513-11517Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Both cyclin D in complex with cdk4 or cdk6 and cyclin E-cdk2 phosphorylate the product of the retinoblastoma gene, the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a well known tumor suppressor. This tumor suppressor activity relies on pRb role in gating S phase entry through its ability to repress genes activated by the E2F family of transcription factors. In fact phosphorylated pRb (ppRb) releases members of the E2F family that play an integral role in cell cycle progression by inducing the expression of gene required for S phase entry, including those involved in DNA synthesis such as S phase regulatory factors cyclin E, cyclin A, and cdk2 (14Herwig S. Strauss M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 581-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 15Lam E.W.F. La Thangue C N.B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). All five E2F family members bind the same DNA sequence, but additional levels of regulation have been observed as follows: E2F-1, E2F-2, and E2F-3 associate with pRb (p110); E2F·pRb complexes are found primarily in G1; E2F-4 and E2F-5 preferentially bind to p107 and p130. Enforced expression by microinjection of E2F-1 induces starved cells to progress through G1 and enter S phase (16Lukas J. Bartkova J. Batek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6917-6925Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In order to understand the mechanism that couples nuclear PLCβ1 and cell cycle machinery, we carried out a detailed analysis of the expression of the proteins involved in the regulation of the cell cycle. For this purpose we have overexpressed PLCβ1a and -b in the nuclear compartment and the mutant M2b, which lacks the nuclear localization sequence (8Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Matteucci A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Peruzzi D. Bavelloni A. Rhee S.G. Cocco L.

The full-length cDNA for rat PLCβ1a (17Suh P.G. Ryu S.H. Moon K.H. Suh H.W. Rhee S.G. Cell. 1988; 54: 161-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), the full-length cDNA for rat PLCβ1b (6Bahk Y.Y. Lee Y.H. Lee T.G. Seo J. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. J. Biol.

Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), were cloned into pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) expression vector plasmid as described elsewhere (18Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2137-2139PubMed Google Scholar). Friend cells were transfected using the following protocol. Briefly, a mixture of 2.5 μg of plasmid DNA and 10 μl of Transfectam (Promega) was added to 1 × 105 cells in 1 well of a 6-well plate for 24 h. The transformants were selected by limiting dilution in medium containing the neomycin analogue G418 at a concentration of 500 ng/ml. Clones were harvested and expanded separately in the presence of G418. Murine erythroleukemia cells (Friend cells, clone 707) were grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For experimental procedures cells were serum-deprived for 48 h and then stimulated with fresh serum for the indicated hours (figure legends). A hypotonic shock combined with non-ionic detergent, essentially described by Martelli et al. (19Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Manzoli L. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Grill V. Zweyer M. Narducci P. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar), has been used. In addition to 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.3 μmaprotinin, 15 μg/ml calpain I inhibitor, and 7.5 μg/ml calpain II inhibitor were also added to the buffers. Nuclear purity was assessed by detection of β-tubulin as described in Ref. 20Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, and only nuclei showing in Western blot a complete absence of β-tubulin were used in the reported experiments. The cytoplasmic fraction was obtained by homogenizing cells with 20 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer in 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.8, 2 mmMgCl2 plus protease inhibitors as above and then pelleting the nuclei at 400 × g. This procedure allows the recovery of pure cytoplasmic fraction and avoids the risk of contamination by nuclear debris that is present in the crude supernatant from nuclear purification. The assay was carried out exactly as described previously (20Martelli A.M. Gilmour R.S. Bertagnolo V. Neri L.M. Manzoli L. Cocco L. Nature. 1992; 358: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Nuclear PLC activity in vitro has been checked by using [3H]phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate and then analyzing the nanomoles of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate released per mg of protein/30 min of incubation. Friend cells transfected with empty vector, clones overexpressing PLCβ1a and -b, and mutants for nuclear localization sequence were analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly cells were grown with 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h and then starved for 24 h. Cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in cold 70% ethanol for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended in a solution containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, 1 mg/ml sodium citrate, 1 μl/ml Triton X-100 and 5 μg/ml RNase A and analyzed by a FACStar Plus flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in 400 μl of swelling buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl), followed by incubation on ice for 10 min. Next the lysates were vortexed for 10 s before centrifugation for 1 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. The pelleted nuclei were resuspended in 50 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA) and left on ice for 20 min with occasional mixing. Subsequently, the lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was stored at −70 °C. All buffers were supplemented with 0.5 mm DTT and 0.2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. A synthetic oligonucleotide containing the consensus binding site for E2F-1, 5′-ATTTAAGTTTCGCGCCCTTTCTCAA-3′ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), was used as a probe for the assay. The probe was labeled with [γ-32P]dATP using T4polynucleotide Kinase (Promega). 10 μg of nuclear extract was used in each binding reaction. Where appropriate, the extract was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature with 5 pm unlabeled E2F-1 oligonucleotide and 5 pm unspecific competitor. For antibody perturbation supershift experiments, 0.25 μg of anti-pRb antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the incubation 10 min prior to addition of oligonucleotide probe and incubated at room temperature. Subsequently, binding to 1 μl of radioactive E2F-1 oligo was carried out in a reaction mixture containing 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm DTT for 30 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Immunoblot analysis of 500 μg of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of wt were immunoprecipitated with 2.5 μg of anti-PLCβ1, a + b isoform, (Transduction Laboratories) for 2 h at 4 °C with constant agitation, followed by 1 h of incubation with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% w/v). Pellets were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Nonidet P-40, twice in 0.1 m Tris, 0.5m LiCl, and twice in Tris, NaCl, EDTA (TNE). Pellets were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose membrane for subsequent immunodetection with the same antibody, followed by detection using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For Western blot analysis, proteins from nuclear extract (20 μg) were separated on an SDS-0.1% polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper. The following antibodies were used: polyclonal antibodies to cyclin D3, cyclin E, cdk2, and cdk4 from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; polyclonal antibodies to pRb and to ppRb for specific phosphorylation sites Ser-795, Ser-780, and Ser-807/811, from New England Biolabs. Cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 1 mmDTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg of leupeptin per ml, 5 μg of aprotinin per ml, 10 mm βglycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 50 mm NaF, followed by a 10-s sonication and clearing by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentration by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad); protein samples of 4 mg each were then immunoprecipitated for at least 2–4 h at 4 °C with protein A-agarose beads precoated with saturating amounts of the appropriate antibody (5 μg). Immunoprecipitated proteins on beads were washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm DTT, 10 mmMgCl2, plus protease inhibitors, as described above). The beads were resuspended in 50 μl of kinase buffer containing 2 μg of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Rb-(769–921) fusion protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 20 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (6000Ci/mmol, ICN). After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the samples were boiled in 2× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated proteins were visualized by exposure to phosphorstorage screens. The antibodies used were as follows: for cyclin D3 and cdk4, polyclonal rabbit antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The subcellular distribution of the two subtypes of the PLCβ1, a and b, was evaluated by Western blot analysis in wild type erythroleukemic Friend cells (Fig.1 B). Although the PLCβ1b is almost entirely localized in the nucleus, the PLCβ1a is nearly equally distributed among the two compartments. The Western blot analysis of the clones overexpressing the PLCβ1a, PLCβ1b, and the mutant for the nuclear localization sequence M2b, respectively, show that whereas the M2b mutant has lost the capacity for nuclear localization, the clones overexpressing the two subtypes β1a and β1b have the PLC in the nucleus, the b form being entirely nuclear and the a form distributed in both nucleus and cytoplasm, even though in the latter compartment it is less expressed (Fig. 1 A). The expression of PLCβ1 forms in wild type cells is very low since the immunoprecipitated PLC from 500 μg of both nuclear and cytoplasmic protein gave rise to a signal even lower than the one obtained with 10 μg of protein from nuclei or cytoplasm of transfected cells. The PLC activity of the clones overexpressing PLCβ1a and M2b mutant as well is the same reported in Ref. 9Matteucci A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Peruzzi D. Bavelloni A. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5057-5060PubMed Google Scholar (i.e. PLCβ1a 38.0 ± 1.5, M2b 9.3 ± 0.7 nmol of IP3/mg of protein/30 min of incubation). These values compared with nuclear PLC activity in wild type cells (9.8 ± 0.6 nmol of IP3/mg protein/30 min of incubation) show a nearly 3-fold increase of the nuclear activity in the case of PLCβ1a and PLCβ1b (32.7 ± 2.0 nmol of IP3/mg of protein/30 min of incubation) with no changes in the case of PLC M2b, which conversely is 3-fold higher in the cytoplasm. These features characterize all the clones we have selected for each type of transfectant and show a complete agreement between the enzymatic activity and the level of expression of the PLCβ1 forms. To determine whether PLCβ1 is involved in cell cycle progression, we examined cyclin D3, cyclin E, cdk2, and cdk4 protein expression in serum-starved cells and after stimulation with serum. In erythroleukemic Friend cells cultured without inducer, the protein levels of cyclin D3 and E fluctuate during the cell cycle, whereas the level of cyclin D2 changes little. Cyclin D1 protein is not detected in these cells. Cyclin D3 increases as cells progress through G1 phase and reaches a maximum level in S phase. Cyclin E peaks at the transition from G1 to S phase (21Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Yokawa H.K. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10251-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 shows that in nuclear extracts of Friend cells, cyclin D3 with its related cdk4 and cyclin E were expressed at barely detectable levels in serum-starved wild type cells and accumulated after stimulation with serum, whereas the level of cdk2 protein, whose activity is low in G1 phase and increases during S phase (21Marks P.A. Richon V.M. Yokawa H.K. Rifkind R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10251-10254Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), is constant after serum stimulation. On the contrary, the clones overexpressing in the nucleus both PLCβ1a and PLCβ1b show high levels of cyclin D3 and cdk4 in serum-starved cells, whereas M2b mutant clone and wild type cells as well do not. Since the expression of cyclin E does not increase in serum-starved transfectants overexpressing PLCβ1a or PLCβ1b, we thought that overexpression of enzymatically active forms of PLCβ1 in the nucleus could exert a specific effect, via cyclin D3·cdk4 complex formation, in sustaining cell cycle progression even in the absence of serum. Therefore, we have evaluated the activity of the cyclin D3·cdk4 complex in vitro in order to establish whether the complex is enzymatically active. Cyclin D3 and cdk4 were immunoprecipitated from total cell lysates, and immune complex was then used for in vitro kinase assay by using a bacterially produced glutathione S-transferase-Rb fusion protein as a substrate. Fig. 2 C shows that the activity of cyclin D3·cdk4 complex, which is almost absent in serum-starved wild type cells and M2b clone, increases after serum stimulation. On the contrary, in the clones overexpressing PLCβ1a and -b in the nucleus the activity of the complex is present even after serum starvation, and its level is similar to that of both wild type cells and M2b clone after serum stimulation. This in vitro feature prompted us to analyze the in vivo phosphorylation status of pRb. We have evaluated pRb phosphorylation by using specific antibodies that detect specific phosphorylated sites as follows: Ser-780, Ser-795, and Ser-807/811 (New England Biolabs). When fresh medium with 10% serum was added for 12 h to serum-starved Friend cells (wild type cells), a significant increase of pRb Ser phosphorylation was observed on Ser-795, Ser-780, and Ser-807/811 as physiologically occurs (Fig.3). Surprisingly transfectants overexpressing both forms of PLCβ1 in the nucleus show high levels of pRb phosphorylation, only on Ser-795, even during serum starvation, whereas this does not occur at all in both the M2b mutant and the wild type cells (Fig. 3). Indeed cells overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus show phosphorylated pRb (Ser-795) after serum starvation for 48 h. The two antibodies against phosphorylation sites Ser-780 and Ser-807/811 did not reveal any phosphorylation in serum-starved clones overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus. The phosphorylation in starved clones, overexpressing PLCβ1 in the nucleus, is restricted to Ser-795 possibly indicating a specific effect of the nuclear localization of PLCβ1. It is concluded that the overexpression of PLCβ1a and -b in the nucleus up-regulates both the expression and the activity of the cyclin D3·cdk4 complex and affects pRb phosphorylation. The absence of these two events in cells overexpressing the same PLC in the cytoplasmic compartment indicates a very specific effect linked to the subcellular localization of this signaling PLC.Figure 3Effect of overexpression of PLC β1 subtypes and the mutant M2b on pRb phosphorylation. Serum-starved cells, as described in the legend to Fig. 2, were diluted at 2 × 105 with fresh medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 12 h after which time pRb phosphorylation was found to peak. Abbreviations for wild type cells and clones are as in the previous figures. The membrane was probed with anti-pRb (New England Biolabs) and with anti-ppRb for specific phosphorylation sites, i.e. Ser-795, Ser-780, and Ser-807/811 (New England Biolabs) in a 7% polyacrylamide gel. The phosphorylated form of Rb protein is indicated by the designation ppRb , the form not phosphorylated is indicated by pRb. The Western blots of stable transfectants reported here are representative of 5 other clones, which behaved in an identical fashion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The Rb proteins bind to a number of cellular proteins like E2F that are involved in the regulation of transcription of genes relevant for the control of the cell cycle. E2F transcription factors regulate the transition from the G1 to S phase, and its activity is regulated by members of pRb family (22Harbour J.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E65-E67Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and appears to be a downstream step of the signaling cascade that takes place in G1 phase. To assess whether overexpression of the two subtypes of PLCβ1 could affect functional changes in E2F activity, we evaluated E2F DNA binding activity in resting cells and in cells after stimulation with serum. Fig. 4 shows the effect of the overexpression of PLCβ1a and -b on E2F-1 binding (19Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R. Manzoli L. Bareggi R. Baldini G. Grill V. Zweyer M. Narducci P. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 815-821PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, in serum-starved clones overexpressing the two nuclear subtypes of PLCβ1 the binding activity was higher than in wild type cells and M2b mutant cells, suggesting that PLCβ1a and -b when localized in the nucleus are indeed involved in the regulation of proteins responsible for the progression of cell cycle. To address whether, after serum starvation, pRb is bound to E2F-1 in both wild type cells and M2b clone and not in serum-starved cells expressing PLCβ1a and -b in the nucleus, we have added anti-pRb antibody in the binding assay. Fig. 4 shows a change in the mobility of the E2F-1 complex only in serum-starved wild type cells and M2b mutant clone. These observations indicate that the E2F-1 transcription factor is already released from pRb in serum-starved Friend cells overexpressing PLCβ1a or -b in the nucleus. Given that E2F transcription factors play an integral role in cell cycle progression by inducing the expression of genes required for S phase entry, we checked the effect of the overexpression of PLCβ1a and -b and M2b mutant on the behavior of the cell cycle in these transfectants by means of flow cytometry. In the presence of serum the clones overexpressing PLCβ1a and -b show a cell cycle profile characterized by a higher S phase compared with wt and the M2b mutant (Fig. 5). Moreover, when the clones overexpressing PLCβ1a and -b in the nucleus are serum-starved, they still maintain a higher S phase compared with wt and M2b cells, the flow cytometric analysis of which shows an almost complete block in G1 phase. Therefore, cells overexpressing the two subtypes of PLCβ1 could at least in part effectively replace the requirement for serum as a mitogenic signal.Figure 5Enforced PLC β1 expression is sufficient to promote cell cycle progression. Cells were grown with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) for 48 h and then starved for 24 h. Abbreviations for wild type cells and clones are as in the previous figures. Both in the presence and absence of serum, clones overexpressing nuclear PLCβ1 show a higher S phase as compared with wild type and M2b-transfected clones. The stable transfectants reported here are representative of 5 other clones, which behaved in an identical fashion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Nuclear PLCβ1 signaling was suggested to be one of the earliest events following both exposure of human osteosarcoma Saos cells to interleukin-1α (23Marmiroli S. Ognibene A. Bavelloni A. Cinti C. Cocco L. Maraldi N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and murine 3T3 cells to IGF-1 (18Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Rubbini S. Bavelloni A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 2137-2139PubMed Google Scholar). A decrease in nuclear PIP2 hydrolysis and down-regulation of nuclear PLCβ1 have been detected during differentiation of erythroleukemia cells (24Cocco L. Martelli A.B. Capitani S. Maraldi N.M. Mazzotti G. Barnabei O. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli F.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 23-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have shown that nuclear PLCβ1 is involved in maintaining the undifferentiated state of Friend erythroleukemia cells, possibly by opposing the inhibition of the cell cycle progression necessary for erythroid differentiation (9Matteucci A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Peruzzi D. Bavelloni A. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5057-5060PubMed Google Scholar). Thus this isoform is a good candidate as a key element for the signaling cascade involved in cell growth and proliferation. The contention that subcellular localization of the inositol lipid cycle is central to the function of the cycle itself in controlling the signaling events has been strengthened by the discovery that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae a nuclear PLC, called PLC1, homologous in function to the mammalian PLCβ1, and two inositol polyphosphate kinases constitute a signaling pathway that affects transcriptional control (25Odom A.R. Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 281: 2026-2029Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Our study was intended to find out how nuclear PLCβ1 is involved in the regulation of cellular proliferation. To address this issue we have tried to identify the targets of nuclear PLCβ1 in the nuclear compartment. Therefore we first examined the expression of cyclins and cdks associated with G1-S phase transition. Our evidence suggests that the overexpression of PLCβ1 in the nucleus is directly responsible for the overexpression and activation of cyclin D3·cdk4 complex, which is known to stimulate progression through G1 rather than to promote the G1-S transition (11Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-555Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2591) Google Scholar). This is indeed a specific target, given that the other cyclin, cyclin E, which is responsible for G1-S transition (26Harbour J.W. Luo R.X. Dei Santiu A. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1999; 98: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar) is not affected at all by nuclear PLCβ1. The two splicing products of this isoform behave in the same fashion, even though the 1b is more specific for nuclear localization and 1a localizes also in the cytoplasmic compartment. This suggests that once PLCβ1 is in the nucleus its role is different from its counterpart located at the plasma membrane. This is supported by the absence of an effect following overexpression of the M2b mutant in which PLC localizes exclusively to the cytosolic compartment (8Kim C.G. Park D. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21187-21192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 9Matteucci A. Faenza I. Gilmour R.S. Manzoli L. Billi A.M. Peruzzi D. Bavelloni A. Rhee S.G. Cocco L. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5057-5060PubMed Google Scholar). In this case the effects on both cyclin D3 and cdk4 as well are totally absent. Only the clones overexpressing both PLCsβ1a and -b, but not the M2b mutant, show a higher S phase compared with wild type and M2b-transfected clones both in cycling and serum-starved cells. This implies that, since cyclin E is not affected, both the overexpression and the activation of the cyclin D3·cdk4 complex are actually responsible for maintaining the cell cycle progression. Downstream events such as the phosphorylation of pRb and the subsequent release of E2F-1 transcription factor are also only observed in PLCβ1a and -b clones after serum starvation. It should be noted that the overexpression of PLCβ1 in the nucleus gives rise to enzymatically functional PLC whose activity is 3-fold higher than the one of wt cells. This enhanced signaling capacity generates second messengers such as diacylglycerol, whose role in nuclear protein kinase C activation has been widely explored (19Martelli A.M. Tabellini G. Bortul R.

Stahlberg A. Wente S.R. York J.D. Science. 2000; 281: 2026-2029Crossref Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Thus, data reported here appear to shed new light on the lipid-mediated signaling machinery residing in the nucleus, implicating nuclear PLCβ1 as a key element for the specific regulation of the cyclin D3·cdk4 complex and its downstream targets such as pRb and E2F in facilitating cell cycle progression. We are grateful to A. M. Martelli and R. S. Gilmour for helpful comments and advice, and we are indebted to S. G. Rhee for the generous gift of M2b mutant."

One major class of serine/threonine kinases mediating signal transduction of various extracellular stimuli, including insulin and growth factors, are mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)1 (for review, see Ref.1Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2249) Google Scholar). Pathways involving MAPK consist of three kinases, i.e.MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK), MAPK kinase (MKK), and MAPK, which are sequentially activated. The activity of MAPK is stimulated by MKK-mediated dual phosphorylation (Thr-X-Tyr) in the activation loop. MKK is regulated by the serine/threonine kinase MKKK, which is linked by protein-protein interaction, phosphorylation, or subcellular relocalization to extracellular stimuli at the cell surface, similar to the receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of insulin and growth factors. Different MAPK cascades have been identified, but the best characterized in mammalian cells is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) pathway leading to the activation of the MAPK isoforms Erk1 and Erk2. The majority of identified MAPK substrates are transcription factors regulating the expression of many genes (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Transcription factors phosphorylated by activated Erk1/Erk2 are involved in hormone action (e.g. estrogen and glucocorticoid receptors), cell growth, and differentiation (e.g. Elk-1, Ets1, Sap-1a, c-Myc, STATs).Sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (called SREBP-1a, SREBP-1c, and SREBP-2) are transcription factors that appear to transmit the signal of membrane-embedded cholesterol levels to the nucleus regulating the expression rate of multiple genes (3Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar, 4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Recently, evidence is accumulating that SREBPs are not only involved in cholesterol-regulated events but are also gene regulatory targets of intracellular signaling pathways, e.g. MAP kinase cascades. In accordance with this hypothesis, we have previously shown that the effects of insulin and PDGF on LDL receptor promoter activity are abolished by a MAP kinase cascade inhibitor and are mediated via the SREBP-binding cis-element sre-1 (5Streicher R.

Overexpression of constitutively active members of the MAP kinase cascade (MEK1, MEKK-1) leads to a sre-1- and SREBP-related stimulation of LDL receptor promoter activity (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that SREBP-1a is a direct substrate of Erk1 and Erk2 in vitro (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report we show that serine 117 is the major phosphorylation site of Erk1/2 in SREBP-1a in vitro. This site was identified with protein chemistry methodology using anion exchange chromatography, reverse-phase HPLC, and mass spectrometry as well as Edman degradation.DISCUSSIONA key step of SREBP regulation appears to be its cleavage in the endoplasmatic reticulum mediated by sequential exposure to different proteases, e.g. a membrane-bound subtilisin-related serine protease (site-1 (S1P) and site-2 (S2P) proteases) belonging to the family of zinc metalloproteases (4Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Sterols inhibit this processing of SREBPs by preventing the interaction with S1P, which is mediated by a SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Therefore, SCAP has a functional role as a sterol sensor. Besides this mechanism, which controls the intracellular abundance of transcriptionally active N-terminal domains of SREBPs, there is increasing evidence indicating that SREBPs are also regulated by extracellular stimuli,e.g. hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Several groups have shown that insulin, PDGF, and cytokines regulate the expression of the LDL receptor gene (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W.

Promoter reporter gene analyses of the LDL receptor promoter have shown that the SREBP binding sterol regulatory element (sre-1) in the LDL receptor promoter is also the cis-element of insulin and PDGF (5Streicher R.

This gene regulatory action of insulin and PDGF on LDL receptor promoter activity is abolished in cells which are deficient in SREBP-1 (5Streicher R. Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Siemeister G.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be reconstituted by overexpressing the transcriptionally active N-terminal domain of SREBPs. MAP kinase cascades play a major role in coupling receptor-associated tyrosine kinases at the cell surface to gene regulatory events (16Gonzales F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that SREBPs are substrates for Erk1 as well as Erk2 in vitro (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it may be likely that SREBPs are a gene regulatory link for metabolic and endocrine signals.To prove this hypothesis we first identified the major phosphorylation site in SREBP-1a after isolating trypsinized phosphopeptides by anion exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC followed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Protein chemistry approaches rather than the random in vitro mutation of all potential sites were chosen because the N-terminal domain of SREBP-1a possesses 17 potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites; in particular 4 sites match the consensus sequences PX(S/T)P (17Avruch J Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and PXX(S/T)P (18Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), i.e.Pro-Ala-Ser63-Pro, Pro-Leu-Ser98-Pro, Pro-Ala-Pro-Thr105-Pro, and Pro-Ala-Phe-Ser117-Pro. In this study we show that serine 117 is the major phosphorylation site of the Erk subfamily of MAP kinases in SREBP-1a. The corresponding sequence and phosphorylation site, serine 117, was identified by two separate lines of evidence,i.e. tandem mass spectrometry and Edman degradation and was verified as the major phosphorylation site by in vitromutagenesis.Structural features of SREBPs show that they belong to the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily (19Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the DNA binding domain, there is a C-terminal protein binding domain and a N-terminal region, which plays a role in activation. Interestingly, SREBPs have an acidic domain in their N-terminal region that appears to play a role in transcriptional activity (20Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 21Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The acidic N-terminal domain in SREBP-1a consists of 42 amino acids, 12 of which are acidic. This N-terminal sequence is then followed by sequences that are rich in proline, serine, glycine, and glutamine. The identified MAP kinase phosphorylation site serine 117 is located next to the N-terminal acidic domain of SREBP-1a and corresponds to a classical consensus site for MAP kinases (PXX(S/T)P) (18Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Because the acidic domain appears to be an activation region for the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a, phosphate incorporation into this domain might increase their negative charge. Therefore we believe that phosphorylation of serine 117 induces a conformational change stimulating transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a, either inherent or by recruiting regulatory proteins (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 22Meier C.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Ericsson J.

Zwicker J. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by promoter reporter gene analysis because only the synergistic stimulatory effects of insulin and PDGF are completely abolished by overexpression of the mutated SREBP-1a-NT S117A and not the basal transcriptional activity. This indicates that serine 117 plays a major role in the signaling of insulin and PDGF to the LDL receptor gene.Taken together, we have shown that SREBP-1a is phosphorylated by the Erk subfamily of MAP kinases at serine 117 and that this site is involved in SREBP-1a-mediated induction of the LDL receptor gene by insulin and PDGF. These data also support the concept that at the protein level, SREBP-1a is regulated by two different principal mechanisms: 1) the abundance of transcriptionally active N-terminal domains are controlled by a sterol-dependent sequential cleavage process and 2) transcriptional activity of the N-terminal domain might be modulated by phosphorylation. Therefore, SREBP-1a appears to be not only a gene regulatory mediator of cellular cholesterol content, but might also be a gene regulatory target of the MAP kinase pathway. Protein phosphorylation at serine and threonine residues is a key regulatory mechanism controlling proteins regulating metabolism, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and gene expression of cells. One major class of serine/threonine kinases mediating signal transduction of various extracellular stimuli, including insulin and growth factors, are mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)1 (for review, see Ref.1Widmann C.

Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). Sterols inhibit this processing of SREBPs by preventing the interaction with S1P, which is mediated by a SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP). Therefore, SCAP has a functional role as a sterol sensor. Besides this mechanism, which controls the intracellular abundance of transcriptionally active N-terminal domains of SREBPs, there is increasing evidence indicating that SREBPs are also regulated by extracellular stimuli,e.g. hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. Several groups have shown that insulin, PDGF, and cytokines regulate the expression of the LDL receptor gene (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Roth G. Kremer L. Munck M. Schürmann S. Knebel B. Krone W.

This gene regulatory action of insulin and PDGF on LDL receptor promoter activity is abolished in cells which are deficient in SREBP-1 (5Streicher R. Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D. Siemeister G.

Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 99-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can be reconstituted by overexpressing the transcriptionally active N-terminal domain of SREBPs. MAP kinase cascades play a major role in coupling receptor-associated tyrosine kinases at the cell surface to gene regulatory events (16Gonzales F.A. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22159-22163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that SREBPs are substrates for Erk1 as well as Erk2 in vitro (6Kotzka J. Müller-Wieland D.

Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore it may be likely that SREBPs are a gene regulatory link for metabolic and endocrine signals.To prove this hypothesis we first identified the major phosphorylation site in SREBP-1a after isolating trypsinized phosphopeptides by anion exchange chromatography and reverse-phase HPLC followed by Edman degradation and mass spectrometry. Protein chemistry approaches rather than the random in vitro mutation of all potential sites were chosen because the N-terminal domain of SREBP-1a possesses 17 potential MAP kinase phosphorylation sites; in particular 4 sites match the consensus sequences PX(S/T)P (17Avruch J Mol. Cell Biochem. 1998; 182: 31-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and PXX(S/T)P (18Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar), i.e.Pro-Ala-Ser63-Pro, Pro-Leu-Ser98-Pro, Pro-Ala-Pro-Thr105-Pro, and Pro-Ala-Phe-Ser117-Pro. In this study we show that serine 117 is the major phosphorylation site of the Erk subfamily of MAP kinases in SREBP-1a. The corresponding sequence and phosphorylation site, serine 117, was identified by two separate lines of evidence,i.e. tandem mass spectrometry and Edman degradation and was verified as the major phosphorylation site by in vitromutagenesis.Structural features of SREBPs show that they belong to the basic helix-loop-helix superfamily (19Sato R. Yang J. Wang X. Evans M.J. Ho Y.R. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17267-17273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides the DNA binding domain, there is a C-terminal protein binding domain and a N-terminal region, which plays a role in activation. Interestingly, SREBPs have an acidic domain in their N-terminal region that appears to play a role in transcriptional activity (20Shimano H. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 846-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 21Oliner J.D. Andresen J.M. Hansen S.K. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2903-2911Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The acidic N-terminal domain in SREBP-1a consists of 42 amino acids, 12 of which are acidic. This N-terminal sequence is then followed by sequences that are rich in proline, serine, glycine, and glutamine. The identified MAP kinase phosphorylation site serine 117 is located next to the N-terminal acidic domain of SREBP-1a and corresponds to a classical consensus site for MAP kinases (PXX(S/T)P) (18Massari M.E. Murre C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1365) Google Scholar). Because the acidic domain appears to be an activation region for the transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a, phosphate incorporation into this domain might increase their negative charge. Therefore we believe that phosphorylation of serine 117 induces a conformational change stimulating transcriptional activity of SREBP-1a, either inherent or by recruiting regulatory proteins (2Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 205-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar, 22Meier C.A. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 1997; 136: 271-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar, 23Ericsson J.

Zwicker J. Kadonaga J.T. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was supported by promoter reporter gene analysis because only the synergistic stimulatory effects of insulin and PDGF are completely abolished by overexpression of the mutated SREBP-1a-NT S117A and not the basal transcriptional activity. This indicates that serine 117 plays a major role in the signaling of insulin and PDGF to the LDL receptor gene.Taken together, we have shown that SREBP-1a is phosphorylated by the Erk subfamily of MAP kinases at serine 117 and that this site is involved in SREBP-1a-mediated induction of the LDL receptor gene by insulin and PDGF. These data also support the concept that at the protein level, SREBP-1a is regulated by two different principal mechanisms: 1) the abundance of transcriptionally active N-terminal domains are controlled by a sterol-dependent sequential cleavage process and 2) transcriptional activity of the N-terminal domain might be modulated by phosphorylation. Therefore, SREBP-1a appears to be not only a gene regulatory mediator of cellular cholesterol content, but might also be a gene regulatory target of the MAP kinase pathway.

Measurements of its infrared absorption cross section show SF(5)CF(3) to have a radiative forcing of 0.57 watt per square meter per parts per billion. This is the largest radiative forcing, on a per molecule basis, of any gas found in the atmosphere to date. Antarctic firn measurements show it to have grown from near zero in the late 1960s to about 0.12 part per trillion in 1999. It is presently growing by about 0.008 part per trillion per year, or 6% per year. Stratospheric profiles of SF(5)CF(3) suggest that it is long-lived in the atmosphere (on the order of 1000 years)."

Buckingham M. Chiang C. Emerson Jr C.P. Development. 1999; 126: 4053-4063PubMed Google Scholar, 32Borycki A.G. Mendham L. Emerson C.P. Development. 1998; 125: 777-790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of myf-5 expression by the dorsal neural tube during myotome formation can be replaced by cells expressing Wnt1 (33Tajbakhsh S. Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the double knock-out of Wnt1 and Wnt3a in mice ablates the dorsal medial region of the dermomyotome and results in the loss of normal early expression of myf-5 but not MyoD (34Ikeya M. Takada S. Development. 1998; 125: 4969-4976PubMed Google Scholar). This indicates an essential role for these signaling molecules in the regulation of myogenic gene expression within the dorsal medial dermomyotome. MyoD expression in the more lateral region of the myotome is thought to be controlled preferentially by signals from the dorsal ectoderm (21Cossu G. Borello U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Cells expressing Wnt7a are capable of replacing the dorsal ectoderm and regulating the expression of MyoD in the more lateral regions of the dermomyotome (33Tajbakhsh S. Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The signaling initiated by Wnt1 and Wnt7a likely utilize different molecular pathways. Wnt1 signals by binding to its receptor, Frizzled 1 (Fz1) and signals through a classic Dishevelled (Dsh) → GSK3 → β-catenin → TCF pathway. In contrast, Wnt7a binds to Fz7 and signals through a β-catenin-independent pathway, utilizing protein kinase C (reviewed in Refs. 21Cossu G. Borello U. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6867-6872Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 35Arias A.M. Brown A.M. Brennan K. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 279-283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar). Both pathways result in the activation of gene expression. Although it is clear that Wnt signaling events result in the expression of MRFs during embryogenesis, a role for Wnt signaling in the regulation of MRF activity has not yet been studied. Another family of signaling molecules involved in patterning the somite are the bone morphogenic proteins (BMPs) (23Tajbakhsh S. Cossu G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 634-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Gossler A. Hrabe de Angelis M. Pederson R.A. Schatten G.P. Current Topics in Developmental Biology. 38.

BMP-4 expression in the lateral mesoderm inhibits muscle differentiation (38Pourquie O. Fan C.M. Coltey M. Hirsinger E. Watanabe Y. Breant C. Francis-West P. Brickell P. Tessier-Lavigne M. Le Douarin N.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 461-471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar), whereas BMP signaling in the dorsal neural tube is important for Wnt expression leading to proper maturation of cells in the dorso-medial lip (39Marcelle C. Stark M.R. Bronnerfraser M. Development. 1997; 124: 3955-3963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pax3, a member of the paired box family of transcription factors, is expressed in the maturing cells of the dorso-medial lip, marking the early stages of myogenic cell specification (40Goulding M. Lumsden A. Paquette A.J. Development. 1994; 120: 957-971PubMed Google Scholar, 41Williams B.A. Ordahl C.P. Development. 1994; 120: 785-796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The level of BMPs within the somite, combined with the presence or absence of its antagonist noggin, controls the ability of Pax3-positive cells to activate MyoD and myf-5 expression (42Reshef R. Maroto M. Lassar A.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 290-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). For example, BMP signaling in the absence of noggin inhibits the ability of Pax3 to activate MyoD. Pax3 is necessary for the expression of MyoD in embryos lacking myf-5, indicating that Pax3 functions upstream of MyoD (43Tajbakhsh S. Rocancourt D. Cossu G. Buckingham M. Cell. 1997; 89: 127-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the overexpression of Pax3 in paraxial mesoderm leads to activation of MyoD and myf-5 expression (44Maroto M. Reshef R. Munsterberg A.E. Koester S. Goulding M. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1997; 89: 139-148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). A tissue culture system capable of emulating early embryonic events that occur during somitogenesis would be valuable for further analysis of the mechanisms involved. The P19 cell culture system may be such a system, because the differentiation of these pluripotent stem cells simulates the biochemical and morphological processes that occur during early embryonic development (45McBurney M.W. Jones-Villeneuve E.M. Edwards M.K. Anderson P.J. Nature. 1982; 299: 165-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 46Skerjanc I.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 1999; 9: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 47Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar). Aggregation of P19 cells induces the expression of the mesoderm marker, Brachyury T (48Vidricaire G. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. Development. 1994; 120: 115-122PubMed Google Scholar), but few of these cells continue to differentiate. Aggregates treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) differentiate into cardiac and skeletal muscle along with other mesodermal and endodermal cell types (49Edwards M.K. Harris J.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1983; 3: 2280-2286Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Cardiocytes first appear on day 5 following Me2SO treatment, whereas skeletal muscle does not appear until day 9 following treatment. The appearance of cardiac and skeletal muscle is dependent both on the presence of Me2SO and on unknown factors in the fetal calf serum (50Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In co-culture experiments, skeletal muscle development in P19 cells was regulated by factors secreted from the neural tube (51Angello J.C. Stern H.M. Hauschka S.D. Dev. Biol. 1997; 192: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Thus, P19 cells provide an easily manipulatable system to examine early developmental events in tissue culture. Previous studies examined how the ectopic expression of MyoD affects the developmental potential of P19 cells (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). P19 cells expressing MyoD (termed P19[MyoD] cells), retained stem cell characteristics and did not differentiate into skeletal muscle until the cells were aggregated, either with or without Me2SO. These results suggested that mesoderm induction, via cellular aggregation, was essential for MyoD activity. Similar results were obtained by others in embryonic stem cells (53Shani M. Faerman A. Emerson C.P. Pearson-White S. Dekel I. Magal Y. Symp. Soc. Exp. Biol. 1992; 46: 19-36PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of P19[MyoD] cells have shown that MyoD protein is present and capable of binding DNA both before and after aggregation (54Armour C. Garson K. McBurney M.W. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 79-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This finding suggests that cellular aggregation is responsible for initiating signaling cascades that regulate MyoD directly. Alternatively, aggregation may indirectly effect MyoD activity, possibly by inducing the expression of an essential cofactor or by altering chromatin structure at muscle-specific promoters. Previous studies have shown that myogenin, like MyoD, requires cellular aggregation to initiate myogenesis (55Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined potential mechanisms involved in regulating MRF activity during cellular aggregation. Here we show that myogenin activity appears to be regulated in a cell lineage-specific and post-translational manner. During aggregation, somite-patterning factors such as Wnt3a, BMP-2/4, and Pax3 are expressed. In monolayer cultures, Wnt3a, but not Pax3 or BMP-4, can activate MRF- induced myogenesis in P19 cells, bypassing the requirement for aggregation. All cDNAs in expression vectors are driven by the phosphoglycerate kinase (pgk-1) promoter (56Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene. 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). The DNA construct PGK-MyoD contains a 1.7-kb EcoRI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of MyoD cDNA (3Davis R.L. Weintraub H. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1987; 51: 987-1000Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2514) Google Scholar), as described (57Pari G. Jardine K. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4796-4803Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-myogenin contains a 1.4-kbEcoRI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of rat myogenin cDNA (7Wright W.E. Sassoon D.A. Lin V.K. Cell. 1989; 56: 607-617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-Pax3 contains a 2.3-kbEcoRI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of Pax3 cDNA (58Goulding M.D. Chalepakis G. Deutsch U. Erselius J.R. Gruss P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1135-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-Wnt3a contains a 1.4-kbEcoRI fragment containing the complete open reading frame of Wnt3a (59Roelink H. Nusse R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-Puro contains the gene encoding puromycin resistance, as described (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The construct PGK-LacZ contains the gene encoding β-galactosidase. PGK-vector DNA is a plasmid containing the pgk-1 promoter alone. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured as described (47Rudnicki M.A. McBurney M.W. Robertson E.J. Teratocarcinomas and Embryonic Stem Cells. A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1987: 19-49Google Scholar, 50Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. In Vitro Cell. Dev. Biol. Anim. 1999; 35: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) in 5% Cosmic calf serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 5% fetal bovine serum (CanSera, Rexdale, Ontario). Cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (60Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar) unless otherwise stated. Stable cell lines expressing myogenin, MyoD, or Wnt3a were generated as described previously (55Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 61Ridgeway A.G. Petropoulos H. Siu A. Ball J.K. Skerjanc I.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 456: 399-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Duplicate transfections were performed with 8 μg of PGK-myogenin or 8 μg of PGK-MyoD, 1 μg of PGK-Puro, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17 (62McBurney M.W. Fournier S. Schmidt-Kastner P.K. Jardine K. Craig J. Somat. Cell. Mol. Genet. 1994; 20: 529-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). To isolate P19 control cell lines, duplicate transfections were performed with 8 μg of PGK-vector, 1 μg of PGK-Puro, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17. To generate cells expressing both MyoD and myogenin, duplicate transfections were performed with 4.5 μg of PGK-MyoD, 4.5 μg of PGK-myogenin, 1 μg of PGK-Puro, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17. After 24 h, β-galactosidase assays were performed on one set to ensure high transfection efficiency, and 2 × 106 cells were plated in a 150-mm dish and selected for puromycin resistance (2 μg/ml). After 7 days, colonies were isolated for further studies. Cells expressing MyoD, myogenin, and both MyoD and myogenin are termed P19[MyoD] (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar), P19[Mgn] (55Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and P19[MyoD+Mgn], respectively. Differentiation was induced by plating 5 × 105 P19 control, P19[MyoD], P19[Mgn], or P19[MyoD + Mgn] cells into 60-mm bacterial dishes containing either 0.8% Me2SO or no Me2SO. The presence or absence of Me2SO had no effect on the ability of the MRFs to induce skeletal myogenesis. However, only in the presence of Me2SO will control cells differentiate into cardiac muscle on day 5 and skeletal muscle on day 9. Cells were cultured as aggregates for 4 days and then plated in tissue culture dishes and harvested for RNA, protein, or fixed for immunofluorescence, at the time indicated. In the aggregation time course experiment, cells were aggregated for 1–4 days and harvested 1 day after transfer into tissue culture dishes. To determine the effect of Pax3 expression on the activity of MyoD or myogenin, PGK-Pax3 was transiently transfected into 4 P19[Mgn] and 4 P19[MyoD] cell lines. 7 μg of PGK-Pax3 and 1 μg of PGK-LacZ were transfected into P19[Mgn] and P19[MyoD] cells using the FuGene 6 transfection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h, cells were plated onto coverslips and allowed to grow in monolayer and fixed on day 6. To produce cells that stably expressed MyoD and Pax3, P19[MyoD] cells were transfected with 10 μg of PGK-Pax3, 1 μg of PGK-Puro, 1 μg of PGK-LacZ, and 2.5 μg of B17, using the CaPO4transfection method (60Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were confirmed to be high (as above), and clones were selected in puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 10 days. Clones were isolated, and those expressing both MyoD and Pax3 were differentiated as described above. To determine the effects of BMP-4 on the ability of MyoD and myogenin to induce myogenesis, P19[MyoD] and P19[Mgn] cells were grown in monolayer and differentiated (described above) in the presence and absence of 1, 5, 25, 100, and 200 ng/ml BMP-4 (Genetics Institute, Cambridge, MA) and fixed after 2, 4, or 6 days in monolayer culture or after 6 days of differentiation. To determine the effects of Wnt3a on MRF activity, P19[MRF] cells were mixed with P19[Wnt3a] cells in ratios of 1:1 or 1:2 depending on the experiment. A total of 150,000 cells was plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips in 35-mm dishes. Cultures were grown for 6 days before fixing for immunofluorescence. These mixes were also grown in the presence of 5 ng/ml BMP-4 where indicated. Cells were fixed in either methanol at −20 °C for 5 min or Lana's fixative (4% paraformaldehyde, 14% v/v saturated picric acid, 125 mm sodium phosphate) for 30 min, rehydrated in PBS for 30 min at room temperature, and then incubated with the appropriate antibody. For total muscle myosin staining, 50 μl of a mouse anti-MyHC monoclonal antibody supernatant, MF20 (63Bader D. Masaki T. Fischman D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 95: 763-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar), was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. For myogenin staining, 100 μl of the anti-myogenin monoclonal antibody supernatant, F5D (64Wright W.E. Dackorytko I.A. Farmer K. Dev. Genet. 1996; 19: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), containing 0.03% Triton X-100 and 5% fetal calf serum, was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. After three 5-min washes in PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h in 50 μl of PBS with 1 μl of goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) Cy3-linked antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, PA). Coverslips were mounted in a solution of 50% glycerol, 40% PBS, 9.9% p-phenylenediamine, and 0.1% Hoechst stain. Immunofluorescence was visualized with a Zeiss Axioskop microscope, and images were captured with a Sony 3CCD color video camera, processed using Northern Exposure, Adobe Photoshop, and Corel Draw software, and printed with a dye sublimation phaser 450 Tektronic printer. Immunofluorescence experiments were repeated at least twice with two P19 control cell lines and four P19[Mgn] cell lines. Total RNA was isolated from differentiated P19 control, P19[MyoD], and P19[Mgn] cell cultures by the lithium chloride/urea extraction method before and after differentiation (65Auffray C. Rougeon F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 107: 303-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (2085) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Total RNA (6 μg) was separated on a 1% agarose, formaldehyde gel. Transfer to Hybond-N (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Oakville, Canada) occurred by capillary blotting, and RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation. The membrane was hybridized to DNA probes labeled to over 109 cpm/μg with [α-32P]dCTP using a multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probes were purified on a spin column of Sephadex G-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C. Washing was performed for 5 × 5 min at room temperature in 2× SSC, 0.2% SDS and for 15 min at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC, 0.2% SDS (0.1× SSC, 0.2% SDS for Wnt5b blots). Hybridization was visualized by autoradiography and with a PhosphorImager SI from Molecular Dynamics. Densitometry was carried out using ImageQuaNT v1.11 software from Molecular Dynamics. The probes used were: a 600-bp PstI fragment from the human cardiac α-actin last exon (66Rudnicki M.A. Jackowski G. Saggin L. McBurney M.W. Dev.

Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a 1.6-kb full-length Wnt7a cDNA (33Tajbakhsh S. Borello U. Vivarelli E. Kelly R. Papkoff J. Duprez D. Buckingham M. Cossu G. Development. 1998; 125: 4155-4162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The skeletal muscle-specific probe was a 600-bp EcoRI fragment from the rat MLC 1/3 cDNA (68Garfinkel L.I. Periasamy M. Nadal-Ginard B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11078-11086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All blots were standardized using a 750-bpEcoRI fragment of rabbit 18 S cDNA. Previous studies have shown that stable P19 cell lines expressing either MyoD or myogenin required aggregation to initiate myogenesis (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 55Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). To examine whether the expression of both MyoD and myogenin could bypass the requirement for cellular aggregation, stable cell lines were isolated that expressed both MRFs. Similar to P19[MyoD] cells (52Skerjanc I.S. Slack R.S. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 1464: 8451-8459Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and P19[Mgn] cells (55Ridgeway A.G. Wilton S. Skerjanc I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41-46Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), P19[MyoD+Mgn] cell lines did not express significant levels of MyHC when grown as a monolayer, as indicated by immunoreaction with the anti-MyHC antibody MF20 (data not shown). However, after 4 days of aggregation with (Fig.1, A, C, andE) or without (Fig. 1, B, D, andF) Me2SO, P19[Mgn] (Fig. 1, C andD) and P19[MyoD+Mgn] (Fig. 1, E andF) cells appeared bipolar and expressed MyHC on day 6.

https://openalex.org/W1990951293,"Recent biochemical studies involving 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein (BCECF)-labeled saponin-permeabilized and parasitized erythrocytes indicated that malaria parasite cells maintain the resting cytoplasmic pH at about 7.3, and treatment with vacuolar proton-pump inhibitors reduces the resting pH to 6.7, suggesting proton extrusion from the parasite cells via vacuolar H+-ATPase (Saliba, K. J., and Kirk, K. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 33213–33219). In the present study, we investigated the localization of vacuolar H+-ATPase in Plasmodium falciparum cells infecting erythrocytes. Antibodies against vacuolar H+-ATPase subunit A and Bspecifically immunostained the infecting parasite cells and recognized a single 67- and 55-kDa polypeptide, respectively. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated that the immunological counterpart of V-ATPase subunits A and B is localized at the plasma membrane, small clear vesicles, and food vacuoles, a lower extent being detected at the parasitophorus vacuolar membrane of the parasite cells. We measured the cytoplasmic pH of both infected erythrocytes and invading malaria parasite cells by microfluorimetry using BCECF fluorescence. It was found that a restricted area of the erythrocyte cytoplasm near a parasite cell is slightly acidic, being about pH 6.9. The pH increased to pH 7.3 upon the addition of either concanamycin B or bafilomycin A1, specific inhibitors of vacuolar H+-ATPase. Simultaneously, the cytoplasmic pH of the infecting parasite cell decreased from pH 7.3 to 7.1. Neither vanadate at 0.5 mm, an inhibitor of P-type H+-ATPase, nor ethylisopropylamiloride at 0.2 mm, an inhibitor of Na+/H+-exchanger, affected the cytoplasmic pH of erythrocytes or infecting parasite cells. These results constitute direct evidence that plasma membrane vacuolar H+-ATPase is responsible for active extrusion of protons from the parasite cells. Recent biochemical studies involving 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein (BCECF)-labeled saponin-permeabilized and parasitized erythrocytes indicated that malaria parasite cells maintain the resting cytoplasmic pH at about 7.3, and treatment with vacuolar proton-pump inhibitors reduces the resting pH to 6.7, suggesting proton extrusion from the parasite cells via vacuolar H+-ATPase (Saliba, K.

Simultaneously, the cytoplasmic pH of the infecting parasite cell decreased from pH 7.3 to 7.1. Neither vanadate at 0.5 mm, an inhibitor of P-type H+-ATPase, nor ethylisopropylamiloride at 0.2 mm, an inhibitor of Na+/H+-exchanger, affected the cytoplasmic pH of erythrocytes or infecting parasite cells. These results constitute direct evidence that plasma membrane vacuolar H+-ATPase is responsible for active extrusion of protons from the parasite cells. ethylisopropylamiloride 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxylfluorescein acetoxymethyl ester phosphate-buffered saline vacuolar H+-ATPase Plasmodium falciparum is a parasitic unicellular protozoa that causes the most serious infectious disease for human beings. The malaria parasite has a complex life cycle. Upon invasion of a host, the parasite lies dormant for some hours and then starts rapid growth followed by cell division, resulting in the generation of new parasite cells. During this development, the malaria parasite develops complex membrane systems outside itself and takes up hemoglobin and digests it in food vacuoles, speculative counterparts of mammalian lysosomes, followed by energy acquisition for growth and cell division (reviewed in Refs. 1Halder K. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 398-405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar and 2Lingelbach K. Joiner K.A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1467-1475PubMed Google Scholar). Glucose is also rapidly taken up by the parasite plasma membrane through a facilitated hexose transporter and is metabolized through glycolysis (3Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), with an approximately 100-fold increase in glucose utilization ability as compared with uninfected erythrocytes (3Woodrow C.J.

Parasitol. 1982; 54: 391-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This higher glycolysis activity increases the formation and export of lactic acid by the infected cells. Consistently, malaria parasite infection gives rise to extensive extracellular acidosis (9White N.J. Scherman I.W. Malaria: Parasite Biology, Pathogenesis, and Protection. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1998: 371-385Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the malaria parasite may somehow extrude protons outside cells, although little is known about the mechanism underlying the proton extrusion.To explain how protons are extruded by the malaria parasite, three mechanisms have been postulated. At first, Mikkelsen et al.(10Mikkelsen R.B. Wallach D.F. Van Doren E. Nillni E.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1986; 21: 83-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 11Mikkelsen R.B. Tanabe K. Wallach D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) suggested that the proton-pump, possibly P-type ATPase, is involved in the extrusion of protons by the malaria parasite cells, since the cytoplasmic pH of rodent malaria cells,Plasmodium chabaudi, decreased upon treatment with N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or vanadate. However, P-type H+-ATPase has not been identified yet in a malaria parasite. The second possibility is the involvement of Na+/H+ antiporter. Bosia et al. (12Bosia A. Ghigo D. Turrini F. Nissani E. Pescarmona G.P. Ginsburg H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 154: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) found that the cytoplasmic pH of parasite-infected erythrocytes was affected by extracellular Na+, which was sensitive to amiloride and its analogue, EIPA,1 inhibitors of the Na+/H+ antiporter (13Wünsch S. Sanchez C.P. Gekle M. Große-Wortman L. Wiesner J. Lanzer M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 335-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). It is suggested that a gene product of PfATPase 1 (encoding MAL1) encoding a putative homologue of the α subunit of Na+/K+-ATPase is a primary Na+-pump for the functional operation of the Na+/H+antiporter (14Krishna S. Cowan G.M. Meada J.C. Wells R.A. Stringer J.R. Robson K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, the molecular nature of the P. falciparum Na+/H+ antiporter and putative primary Na+-pump remains obscure. Very recently, Saliba and Kirk (15Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) presented evidence for a third type of proton extrusion by a malaria parasite. They labeled P. falciparum cells with BCECF, a fluorescent pH indicator, and then measured the cytoplasmic pH in the presence or absence of various H+-pump inhibitors. They observed that bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of V-ATPase (16Bowman E.J. Sieber A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar), caused acidification of the cytoplasm of the malaria parasite cells, whereas vanadate and amiloride analogues had little effect. From these observations, they proposed that active proton extrusion via V-ATPase may occur through the plasma membrane of the malaria parasite cells and that inhibition of V-ATPase may cause acidification of the cytoplasm due to the inevitable accumulation of protons.V-ATPase is a multisubunit protein complex comprising distinct catalytic and membrane sectors, whose subunit structure is well conserved among animals, plants, fungi, and even some bacteria (17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar,18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In P. falciparum, the cDNAs encoding V-ATPase subunits A and B have been cloned and sequenced, and immunological counterparts of these subunits have been identified (19Karcz S.R. Herrmann V.R. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Karcz S.R. Herrmann V.R. Trottein F. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The internal pH of food vacuoles is known to be acidic (21Yayon A. Cabantchik Z.I. Ginsburg H. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2695-2700Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar,22Krogstad D.J. Schlesinger P.H. Gluzman I.Y. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 2302-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Mg2+-ATPase activity in the food vacuole fraction has also been identified and characterized (23Choi I. Mego J.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest the presence of functional V-ATPase in malaria parasite cells, the precise localization of V-ATPase at the subcellular level is less understood.The present study was conducted to determine the localization of V-ATPase in P. falciparum cells infecting erythrocytes using immunoelectron microscopy with antibodies against V-ATPase subunitsA and B. It was found that V-ATPase is localized at the plasma membrane as well as intracellular vesicular structures including food vacuoles. Moreover, it was found that a limited area of the erythrocyte cytoplasm outside the parasite cell is acidic. The acidic pH is sensitive to bafilomycin A1 and concanamycin B, potent and specific V-ATPase inhibitors (16Bowman E.J. Sieber A. Altendorf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7972-7976Crossref PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 25Dröse S. Bindseil K.U. Bowman E.J. Siebers A. Zeeck A. Altendorf K.

These results strongly suggest that V-ATPase is functionally expressed at the plasma membrane of malaria parasite cells and pumps protons out of the organisms.DISCUSSIONV-ATPase is present in various endomembrane organelles and plasma membranes and pumps protons at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The resultant acidic pH in organelles and extracellular space is important for various biological phenomena including the accumulation of ions and nutrients, extrusion of ions and harmful drugs, and so on (17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Previous reports have been shown that in the malaria parasite V-ATPase is present in food vacuoles and acidifies the internal space for hydrolysis of hemoglobin for energy acquisition (19Karcz S.R.

Parasitol. 1994; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that V-ATPase is mainly associated with small clear vesicles and the plasma membrane in addition to food vacuoles.Saliba and Kirk (15Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that trophozoite stage malaria parasites within saponin-permeabilized human erythrocytes extrude protons via a Na+-independent mechanism. The proton extrusion was sensitive to bafilomycin A1, indicating the possible involvement of V-ATPase in the extrusion process. The immunohistochemical distribution of the V-ATPase in trophozoite stage parasites that we observed is fully consistent with their observation. The immunogold particles for V-ATPase labeling the plasma membrane face the cytoplasmic side, suggesting that the catalytic sector of V-ATPase faces the cytoplasm. This orientation of the V-ATPase makes it possible for it to pump protons from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space across the plasma membrane. Consistently, a restricted area outside a malaria parasite in a parasitized erythrocyte is acidic (Figs. 3 and4). Treatment with either bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin B caused disappearance of the acidic region and simultaneously acidification of the cytoplasm of the malaria parasite. The bafilomycin A1-evoked acidification of the cytoplasm of the parasite cell is supposed to be due to blockade of proton extrusion through V-ATPase (15Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These observations constitute strong evidence for the functional occurrence of proton extrusion via V-ATPase at the plasma membrane.Of course our results do not completely rule out the participation of a Na+/H+ antiporter in the proton extrusion through the plasma membrane, although vanadate and EIPA apparently did not affect the cytoplasmic pH of infecting malarial cells (Table II). Studies for identification of the Na+/H+antiporter and primary Na+-pump, and their characterization at the molecular level, allow re-evaluation of the possible contribution of the Na+/H+ antiporter, if any, to proton extrusion from the parasite.The finding that V-ATPase is localized in various organelles other than food vacuoles is important for understanding the physiology of the parasite. A V-ATPase-evoked acidic environment has been realized to be important for various biological phenomena including the transport of nutrients, ions, toxins, and organellar fusion events. Small clear vesicles are morphologically distinct from dense granules containing subtilisin-like protein or rhoptry (39Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Gringer M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is possible that small clear vesicles are involved in endocytosis/exocytosis of the parasites (40Ward G.E. Tilney L.G. Langsley G. Parasitol. Today. 1997; 13: 57-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 41Atkinson C.T. Aikawa M. Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 351-368PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, as in the case of the plasma membranes of mammals and insects (6Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), proton pumping by plasma membrane V-ATPase and resultant acidification of the extracellular space might be energetically coupled with transporters for the accumulation of nutrients and regulation of ions in and extrusion of antimalarial agents from the parasites. It is also possible that the acidic pH is responsible for the bafilomycin-evoked increase in sensitivity to chloroquine (24Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Wards S.A. Biochem. Parasitol. 1992; 43: 1219-1227Google Scholar). Further studies on the function of the plasma membrane V-ATPase and the resultant acidification will facilitate elucidation of novel physiological features of the parasite.In conclusion, we presented evidence of the presence of V-ATPase in food vacuoles, small clear vesicles, and the plasma membrane ofP. falciparum cells. The V-ATPase at the plasma membrane is responsible for extrusion of protons through the membrane and thereby acidifies the area outside a parasite. We suppose that the malaria parasite uses this acidic pH to transport ions and nutrients for its survival.

It is also possible that the acidic pH is responsible for the bafilomycin-evoked increase in sensitivity to chloroquine (24Bray P.G. Howells R.E. Wards S.A. Biochem.

Further studies on the function of the plasma membrane V-ATPase and the resultant acidification will facilitate elucidation of novel physiological features of the parasite.In conclusion, we presented evidence of the presence of V-ATPase in food vacuoles, small clear vesicles, and the plasma membrane ofP. falciparum cells. The V-ATPase at the plasma membrane is responsible for extrusion of protons through the membrane and thereby acidifies the area outside a parasite. We suppose that the malaria parasite uses this acidic pH to transport ions and nutrients for its survival. V-ATPase is present in various endomembrane organelles and plasma membranes and pumps protons at the expense of ATP hydrolysis (17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The resultant acidic pH in organelles and extracellular space is important for various biological phenomena including the accumulation of ions and nutrients, extrusion of ions and harmful drugs, and so on (17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N. Harvey W.R. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 361-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Previous reports have been shown that in the malaria parasite V-ATPase is present in food vacuoles and acidifies the internal space for hydrolysis of hemoglobin for energy acquisition (19Karcz S.R. Herrmann V.R. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1993; 58: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20Karcz S.R. Herrmann V.R. Trottein F. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In the present study, we found that V-ATPase is mainly associated with small clear vesicles and the plasma membrane in addition to food vacuoles. Saliba and Kirk (15Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) reported that trophozoite stage malaria parasites within saponin-permeabilized human erythrocytes extrude protons via a Na+-independent mechanism. The proton extrusion was sensitive to bafilomycin A1, indicating the possible involvement of V-ATPase in the extrusion process. The immunohistochemical distribution of the V-ATPase in trophozoite stage parasites that we observed is fully consistent with their observation. The immunogold particles for V-ATPase labeling the plasma membrane face the cytoplasmic side, suggesting that the catalytic sector of V-ATPase faces the cytoplasm. This orientation of the V-ATPase makes it possible for it to pump protons from the cytoplasm into the extracellular space across the plasma membrane. Consistently, a restricted area outside a malaria parasite in a parasitized erythrocyte is acidic (Figs. 3 and4). Treatment with either bafilomycin A1 or concanamycin B caused disappearance of the acidic region and simultaneously acidification of the cytoplasm of the malaria parasite. The bafilomycin A1-evoked acidification of the cytoplasm of the parasite cell is supposed to be due to blockade of proton extrusion through V-ATPase (15Saliba K.J. Kirk K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33213-33219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These observations constitute strong evidence for the functional occurrence of proton extrusion via V-ATPase at the plasma membrane. Of course our results do not completely rule out the participation of a Na+/H+ antiporter in the proton extrusion through the plasma membrane, although vanadate and EIPA apparently did not affect the cytoplasmic pH of infecting malarial cells (Table II). Studies for identification of the Na+/H+antiporter and primary Na+-pump, and their characterization at the molecular level, allow re-evaluation of the possible contribution of the Na+/H+ antiporter, if any, to proton extrusion from the parasite. The finding that V-ATPase is localized in various organelles other than food vacuoles is important for understanding the physiology of the parasite. A V-ATPase-evoked acidic environment has been realized to be important for various biological phenomena including the transport of nutrients, ions, toxins, and organellar fusion events. Small clear vesicles are morphologically distinct from dense granules containing subtilisin-like protein or rhoptry (39Blackman M.J. Fujioka H. Stafford W.H.L. Sajid M. Clough B. Fleck S.L. Aikawa M. Gringer M. Hackett F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23398-23409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). It is possible that small clear vesicles are involved in endocytosis/exocytosis of the parasites (40Ward G.E. Tilney L.G. Langsley G. Parasitol.

Furthermore, as in the case of the plasma membranes of mammals and insects (6Wieczorek H. Brown D. Grinstein S. Ehrenfeld J. Harvey W.R. BioEssays. 1999; 21: 637-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 17Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar, 18Nelson N.

We show that La protein was cleaved to generate a 43-kDa fragment during apoptosis of human leukemic HL-60 cells treated with camptothecin or etoposide. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that the La protein level was increased in the cytoplasm during apoptosis of HL-60 cells. In addition, UV irradiation of HeLa cells led to the cleavage and redistribution of La protein upon apoptosis.

Proteolytic cleavage of key substrates is an important biochemical mechanism underlying the apoptotic process, and interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases have been reported to play crucial roles as mediators of apoptosis (1Yuan J.

Identifying substrates of interleukin-1β-converting enzyme or interleukin-1β-converting enzyme-like proteases and determining cleavage sites are important to understand the apoptotic process. A variety of antitumor drugs have been shown to induce apoptosis and to cause changes in nuclear morphology in rapidly proliferating cells, lymphoid tissues, and tumors (4Pienta K.J. Ward W.S. Med. Hypotheses. 1994; 42: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5Kerr J.F.R. Harmon B.V. Cancer (Phila. ). 1994; 73: 2013-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). Camptothecin and etoposide, which are antitumor drugs, induce apoptosis of HL-60 cells in addition to numerous tumors (6Pommier Y. Tanizawa A. Hickman J. Tritton T. Cancer Chemotherapy.

We developed several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)1 to examine changes in nuclear architecture during this process. We screened for changes in the expression and/or localization of components of the cytoskeleton and nuclear matrix in association with apoptosis of HL-60 cells.

La protein is well known as an autoantigen, and sera from patients with rheumatoid diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus frequently contain antibodies directed against La protein (18Lerner M.R.

Apoptotic cell antigens have been identified as the targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases, and it has been proposed that apoptotic cells are a primary source of autoantigens (20Casciola-Rosen L.A.

Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 6-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Our findings provide insight into the mechanism of redistribution of La protein during apoptosis of various types of cells and the production of autoantibodies against La protein. Mouse myeloma P3-X63-Ag8.653 cells that were used for production of hybridoma were obtained from the RIKEN Gene Bank. HL-60, Jurkat, U937, and HeLa cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Leukemia cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. Camptothecin (TopoGEN) and etoposide (Nippon-Kayaku) were dissolved in a 1:1 (v/v) mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide and ethanol and stored at −20 °C until used. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. Subconfluent monolayer cultures of HeLa cells were washed twice with PBS (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 8 mm Na2HPO4) and irradiated in PBS with 100 J of 254 nm UV light/m2 (Spectrolinker XL-1500, Spectronics Corp., Westbury, NY). The anti-poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) C-2-10 antibody was obtained from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge). After washing with PBS, HL-60 cells were extracted on ice for 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm PIPES (pH 6.8), 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm vanadyl riboside complex, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The insoluble fraction was collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min. For immunization, chromatin was removed from the Triton X-100-insoluble material by DNase I (Sigma) digestion, followed by 0.25 mammonium sulfate extraction as described by Fey and Penman (23Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). The chromatin-depleted insoluble materials were mixed with Freund's complete adjuvant for the first immunization or with Freund's incomplete adjuvant for booster immunizations. Spleen cells were collected from immunized BALB/c mice and were fused with mouse myeloma cells by the polyethylene glycol method (24Galfre G. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 3-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from HL-60 cells, and mRNA was purified on an oligo(dT)-cellulose column (25Sambrook J.T. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). cDNAs were synthesized using random hexadeoxynucleotides as the primer and cloned into the EcoRI site of λgt11 arms according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). The λgt11 cDNA libraries were immunoscreened with this mAb (24Galfre G. Milstein C. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 73: 3-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1403) Google Scholar) as described (25Sambrook J.T. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cloned cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using λgt11 forward and reverse primers and introduced into the vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for expression as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. The glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis with the mAb to exclude false-positive cDNA clones. The polymerase chain reaction product of the cDNA clone was directly sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52746) Google Scholar). To determine the region of La protein recognized by mAb 24 more precisely (see “Results”), the coding sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction, inserted into pGEX4T-1, and expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein. HL-60 cells were collected by centrifugation at 600 × g for 5 min, placed on 14-well Teflon-coated slide glasses (Cel-Line/Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH), and fixed with 70% ethanol or acetone/methanol (1:1) for 15 min. After soaking in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 15 min, samples were incubated with the first antibody at room temperature for 60 min and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako Japan, Kyoto, Japan) in 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were examined using a fluorescence microscope (Axioskop, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Apoptotic cells were determined by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method (27Gavrieli Y. Sherman Y. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 493-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). DNA strand breaks were demonstrated by labeling 3′-OH termini with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled deoxyuridine using anin situ apoptosis detection kit (Takara, Kyoto). After TUNEL staining, cells were immunostained with anti-La mAb. In this case, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Dako Japan) was used as the second antibody. HL-60 cells (1 × 106) were washed with Krebs-Ringer buffer and lysed on ice with 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, antipain, and leupeptin (28Casciola-Rosen L.

The protein concentration of the cell lysate was adjusted to 1 mg/ml. Aliquots of 18 μl of cell lysate were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of 2 μl of 0.37 mg/ml (3300 units/ml) recombinant caspase-3 (Medical and Biological Laboratories Co., LTD, Nagoya, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An NH2-terminal peptide (1MAENGDNEKMAALEA15) and a COOH-terminal peptide (388ETDKEEPASKQQKTE402) of La were synthesized by Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) solid-phase peptide synthesis (Takara). A cysteine residue was added to the NH2 terminus of each of the synthetic peptides for coupling to bovine serum albumin. The peptides were coupled to bovine serum albumin using maleimidobenzoic acid hydroxysuccinimide ester as a linker (29Jemmerson R. Morrow P.R. Klinman N.R. Paterson Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1508-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The peptide-coupled bovine serum albumin was used to immunize New Zealand White rabbits, and antisera were obtained. cDNAs of full-length (La) and COOH-terminally truncated (LaΔC374) forms of La proteins were synthesized by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. An antisense primer of La mRNA (5′-TAAACTACTGGTCTCCAGCA-3′) was used for reverse transcription. cDNAs of La and LaΔC374 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the sense primer 5′-CGGAATTCATGGCTGAAAATGGTGATAAT-3′ and the antisense primers 5′-ACGCGTCGACCTACTGGTCTCCAGCACCAT-3′ and 5′-ACGCGTCGACGCTAATCATGTTCATCATGT-3′, respectively. Each cDNA was digested with EcoRI and SalI and cloned into the pEGFP-c2 mammalian expression vector (CLONTECH). Exponentially growing COS-7 cells were plated in 6-well tissue culture dishes for Western blot analysis or on coverslips for immunofluorescence staining and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C. Each construct was transfected into COS-7 cells by lipofection using TransomeTM (Wako, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridoma was cultured in protein-free hybridoma medium Protein-free hybridoma medium-II (Life Technologies, Inc.), and anti-La mAb was purified from culture fluid using protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The purified anti-La mAb was conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). HL-60 cells that were treated with 10 μg/ml etoposide for 12 h were lysed in 150 mmNaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, antipain, pepstatin A, and leupeptin. The cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min and incubated with anti-La mAb-conjugated Sepharose 4B for 1 h at 4 °C. After elution with 0.1 m glycine (pH 2.5), the affinity-purified proteins were concentrated and desalted using a centrifugal filter device (Microcon YM-30, Millipore Corp.). DE-MALDI-TOF-MS was carried out on a Voyager Elite XL Biochemical Workstation (6.5-m flight length linear mode; Perseptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). Sinapinic acid was used as a matrix. A nitrogen laser (337 mm) was used for ionization. Acceleration voltage was set 20,000 V; grid voltage was set at 74% of the acceleration voltage; and guide wire voltage was 0.05% of the acceleration voltage. Delay time was 250 ns. To examine changes in nuclear architecture during apoptosis, we developed mAbs against nuclear matrix proteins (23Fey E.G. Penman S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 121-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) in apoptotic HL-60 cells. Labeling with one mAb, designated mAb 24, was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy, and marked changes in HL-60 cells during apoptosis were observed. We immunoscreened λgt11 HL-60 cDNA libraries with mAb 24 and isolated one cDNA clone encoding a polypeptide that was identical to La protein from amino acids 320 to 393. La is a nuclear protein composed of 408 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 46,837 Da (30Chambers J.C. Keene J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 2115-2119Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 31Chambers J.C. Kenan D. Martin B.J. Keene J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18043-18051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAb 24 recognized a polypeptide with a molecular mass of ∼47 kDa upon Western blotting (Fig. 1) and stained the nuclei of various human cells upon immunofluorescence microscopy. Western blot analysis of cell lysates with anti-La mAb revealed extra polypeptides in addition to the native 47-kDa polypeptide of La in HL-60 cells treated with camptothecin (Fig. 1 a) or etoposide (data not shown). A 43-kDa fragment was prominent in lysates. PARP is a well documented caspase-3 substrate and is cleaved in the early stages of apoptosis (32Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Mundany N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T., Yu, V.L. Miller D.K.

Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar). We compared La protein with PARP in HL-60 cells and found that after incubation with camptothecin for 12 h, >80% of PARP was cleaved (data not shown), but only ∼35–40% of La protein was cleaved (Fig. 1 a). This result indicates that La protein is not as good a substrate for caspases as PARP. Similarly, camptothecin induced apoptosis of human monocytic leukemic U937 cells and T-cell lymphoma Jurkat cells, where the 43-kDa fragment was generated (data not shown). Immunofluorescence analysis with anti-La mAb revealed marked changes in HL-60 cells treated with camptothecin or etoposide. In non-apoptotic cells, La was predominantly nuclear. However, in apoptotic cells, nuclear La protein levels were decreased, whereas cytoplasmic levels were increased (Fig. 1 b). TUNEL staining clearly demonstrated that the redistribution of La protein was associated with DNA fragmentation (Fig. 1 c). Similar findings were observed in Jurkat and U937 cells, where La protein levels were increased in the cytoplasm during apoptosis induced by the antitumor drugs (data not shown). TUNEL staining and various morphological features such as reduction in cell volume and cytoplasmic blebbing were used to identify apoptotic cells. After treatment with camptothecin or etoposide, apoptotic cells were found to increase as shown in Fig.2. However, in some cases where cell fragmentation had occurred, immunofluorescence staining was not seen with TUNEL, and 50% of these cells were permeable to trypan blue. Furthermore, La staining was seen in TUNEL-negative cells that appeared to be highly fragmented, and the levels of La staining were much lower than those in TUNEL-positive cells. These results indicate that some populations of apoptotic cells go on to late stages of apoptosis or undergo secondary necrosis in antitumor drug-treated HL-60 cells.Figure 2Kinetic studies on apoptosis and redistribution of La protein. HL-60 cells were incubated with camptothecin (a) or etoposide (b) for the indicated times as described in the legend to Fig. 1. Cells were collected, and the distribution of La protein was determined by immunostaining with anti-La mAb 24. Cells exhibiting cytoplasmic La staining were counted. TUNEL-positive cells were solely those cells stained by the TUNEL method as described in the legend to Fig.1, and apoptotic cells were TUNEL-positive cells and TUNEL-negative cells with apoptotic morphology (blebbing and cell fragmentation). Cells exhibiting both cytoplasmic La staining and TUNEL-positive cells were also counted.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Cytoplasmic La staining was seen in most of the TUNEL-positive cells (Fig. 2). Here, we must emphasize that cytoplasmic La protein levels were variable among TUNEL-positive cells, and La staining was still seen in the nuclei of most of these cells (Fig. 1 c). La protein exhibited two changes upon apoptosis, i.e.proteolytic cleavage and nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution. We next investigated the relationship between the generation of the 43-kDa polypeptide and the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of La antigen. To investigate whether these changes in La protein seen in apoptotic leukemia cells occurred in adherent cells upon apoptosis, we analyzed the apoptotic process in HeLa cells. UV irradiation of HeLa cells led to nuclear condensation and morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis after ∼6–24 h. La protein was predominantly nuclear in non-apoptotic HeLa cells, but it translocated to the cytoplasm upon apoptosis (Fig.3 b). The cleavage product of the 43-kDa polypeptide was increased during apoptosis induced by UV irradiation, and a good correlation was observed between cleavage of La and the number of cells exhibiting cytoplasmic La staining (Fig.3 c). We compared La protein with PARP in HeLa cells and found that La protein was not as good a substrate for caspases as PARP (Fig. 3 a), as found in HL-60 cells. These results in HeLa cells were consistent with those in leukemia cells, indicating that the cleavage and redistribution of La protein are common in various types of cells during apoptosis. The native 47-kDa La polypeptide is cleaved to generate a 43-kDa fragment during apoptosis. This result indicated that La protein is cleaved at ∼30–40 amino acids downstream from the NH2 terminus or upstream from the COOH terminus. We developed antisera against the NH2- and COOH-terminal peptides of La protein in rabbits (Fig. 4 a). As shown in Fig.4 b, the anti-COOH-terminal peptide antibody recognized the native 47-kDa polypeptide, but not the cleaved 43-kDa polypeptide, whereas the anti-NH2-terminal peptide antiserum recognized both the 47- and 43-kDa polypeptides. These results demonstrate that La protein is cleaved at ∼30–40 amino acids upstream from the COOH terminus (Fig. 4 a). The DEXD motif of the caspase-3 cleavage site (35Thornberry N.A. Rano T.A.

As mentioned above, mAb 24 used in this study was identified as an anti-La mAb recognizing a polypeptide of La protein from amino acids 320 to 393. The putative caspase-3 cleavage site(s) was present from amino acids 320 to 393. We then expressed a polypeptide of La from amino acids 320 to 371 as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase using the pGEX4T-1 expression vector. Western blotting showed that anti-La mAb 24 recognized the fusion protein (data not shown), indicating that the epitope of anti-La mAb 24 is present from amino acids 320 to 371 of La protein. We tested whether exogenous caspase-3 would cleave La protein as seen during apoptosis. Incubation of untreated cell lysate with recombinant caspase-3 resulted in cleavage of the 47-kDa La polypeptide to a 43-kDa fragment, identical in size to the fragment observed during apoptosis (Fig. 5 a). We next examined the effects of caspase inhibitors on cleavage of La protein in intact cells. A specific inhibitor of caspase-3, acetyl-DEVD-aldehyde, decreased generation of the 43-kDa fragment in HL-60 cells treated with antitumor drugs (Fig. 5 b). In contrast, the interleukin-1β-converting enzyme inhibitor acetyl-YVAD-aldehyde did not inhibit cleavage of La protein. There are two possible caspase-3 cleavage sites (Asp-371 and Asp-374) in the COOH terminus of La protein. To map the cleavage site, we isolated La protein and its fragment from etoposide-treated HL-60 cells by anti-La mAb affinity chromatography and determined the molecular mass by DE-MALDI-TOF-MS (Fig. 6). The molecular masses of the native La polypeptide and the 43-kDa polypeptide are 46,831 ± 31 and 43,182 ± 44 Da (n = 5), respectively. Based on the amino acid sequence, the molecular mass of the native La protein is 46,837 Da, and those of two possible fragments are 42,816 Da for Asp-371 and 43,197 Da for Asp-374. This result indicates that La protein is cleaved after Asp-374 by caspase-3 or a caspase-3-like protease in apoptotic cells. Simons et al. (37Simons F.H. Broers F.J. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 224: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) assigned the NLS to the COOH-terminal polypeptide from amino acids 383 to 401 by microinjection of in vitro translated La protein into Xenopus laevis oocytes. To evaluate the effects of the COOH-terminal truncation of La protein on its localization, we expressed the full-length or truncated form of La protein as a fusion protein with GFP using the pEGFP-c2 expression vector. Since we identified the site of cleavage, we constructed plasmids to fuse the full-length (La) or truncated (LaΔC374) form of La protein to the COOH terminus of GFP. When each construct was transfected into COS-7 cells, each fusion protein of the expected size was expressed (Fig.7 a). Immunofluorescence analysis of these cells showed that the GFP fusion protein with full-length La protein (GFP-La) was localized in the nucleus. In contrast, GFP-LaΔC374 was distributed in the cytoplasm (Fig.7 b). Nuclear green fluorescence staining was seen in COS-7 cells expressing GFP-LaΔC374, and almost the same levels of green fluorescence were seen in those expressing GFP (Fig. 7 b). Image analysis showed that the intensity of nuclear green fluorescence was less (<5%) than that of cytoplasmic staining in both cases for GFP and GFP-LaΔC374. The reason for the leakage of GFP and GFP-LaΔC374 to the nucleus was uncertain. When COS-7 cells expressing GFP-La were irradiated with UV, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic redistribution of green fluorescence was seen in some cells. Furthermore, a cleaved polypeptide that was almost the same size as GFP-LaΔC374 was detected by Western blot analysis (data not shown). These observations suggest that loss of NLS may be responsible for the redistribution of La protein to the cytoplasm during apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that La protein loses its COOH-terminal NLS by proteolytic cleavage during apoptosis and that the loss of NLS leads to the redistribution of La protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Apoptosis is accompanied by disorganization of the nuclear architecture, cytoskeleton, and cell membrane. Members of the caspase family of cysteine proteases play essential roles in apoptosis (1Yuan J. Shaham S. Ledoux S. Ellis H.M. Horvitz H.R.

For example, caspase-2, caspase-3, and caspase-7 each display similar specificities, which suggests that their roles in cells are at least overlapping, if not completely redundant (33Fernandes-Alnemri T.

Amino acid sequence analysis of the COOH-terminal portion of human La protein revealed a DEHD sequence repeat that fits the DXXD motif, 368DEHDEHD374. Thus, there are two possible cleavage sites for caspase-3, Asp-371 and Asp-374; but La protein is cleaved only at Asp-374 in apoptotic HL-60 cells upon apoptosis. This result demonstrates that the cleavage site in apoptotic cells is not solely determined by the DXXD motif, but that other factors such as the amino acid sequence surrounding the DXXD motif, interaction with other molecules, or conformation may influence the acceptability of each DXXD sequence. La protein is cleaved less efficiently than the well documented caspase-3 substrate of PARP, indicating that the cleavage site of La protein is less accessible to caspases than that of PARP. After submission of this manuscript, Rutjes et al. (40Rutjes S.A. Utz P.J. van der Heijden A. Broekhuis C. Van Venrooij W.J. Pruijn G.J. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 976-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) reported that La protein was proteolytically cleaved in vivo, generating a 45-kDa fragment. Based on the molecular size of the fragment upon SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the observation that caspase-specific inhibitors prevented cleavage of La protein, they proposed that La protein might be cleaved at Asp-371 and/or Asp-374 upon apoptosis. Their results are consistent with ours. Sera from patients with rheumatoid diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjögren's syndrome frequently contain antibodies directed against La (18Lerner M.R. Boyle J.A. Mount S.M.

As shown in this study, La protein shows distinctive behavior during apoptosis, and this may be a general phenomenon associated with apoptosis of various types of cells. Apoptotic cell antigens have been identified as the targets of autoantibodies in autoimmune diseases, and it was proposed that apoptotic cells were the primary source of autoantigens (20Casciola-Rosen L.A.

It would be interesting to determine whether loss of NLS by caspases is responsible for the redistribution of La protein in all of these cases. We thank Drs. M.

https://openalex.org/W2128344667,"The non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 appears to function at a point of convergence of integrins and certain G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascades. In this study, we provide evidence that translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions is triggered both by cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and by activation of the histamine GPCR. By using different mutants of PYK2 as green fluorescent fusion proteins, we show that the translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions is not dependent on its catalytic activity but rather is mediated by its carboxyl-terminal domain. Translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions was attributed to enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and its association with the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and p130Cas. Translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions, as well as its tyrosine phosphorylation in response to histamine treatment, was abolished in the presence of protein kinase C inhibitors or cytochalasin D treatment, whereas activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester resulted in focal adhesion targeting of PYK2 and its tyrosine phosphorylation in an integrin-clustering dependent manner. Overexpression of a wild-type PYK2 enhanced ERK activation in response to histamine, whereas a kinase-deficient mutant substantially inhibited this response. Furthermore, inhibition of PYK2 translocation to focal adhesions abolished ERK activation in response to histamine treatment. These results suggest that PYK2 apparently links between GPCRs and focal adhesion-dependent ERK activation and can provide the molecular basis underlying PYK2 function at a point of convergence between signaling pathways triggered by extracellular matrix proteins and certain GPCR agonists.

Stimulation of various GPCRs induces a rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of many signaling proteins, including several protein tyrosine kinases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Grb2-interacting proteins Shc and Gab1 was shown to be induced upon LPA (5van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Luttrell D.K. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Porfiri E. Sakaue M.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1037-1044Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Likewise, receptor tyrosine kinases, such as epidermal growth factor or platelet-derived growth factor receptors, become tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to certain GPCR agonists including endothelin-1, LPA, and thrombin (10Daub H. Weiss F.U. Wallasch C. Ullrich A. Nature. 1996; 379: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Activation of these receptor tyrosine kinases induces the formation of complex between the Grb2 adaptor protein and the guanine nucleotide exchanger factor Sos, which upon recruitment to the plasma membrane allows activation of the small GTP-binding protein Ras and subsequent activation of the MAPK pathway (11Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). Among the non-receptor tyrosine kinases, the Src family members were suggested to link GPCR stimulation to MAPK pathway activation. Inhibition of Src activity significantly attenuated MAPK activation in response to LPA, bradykinin, or thrombin (12Della Rocca G.J. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Lefkowitz R.J. Luttrell L.M. J. Biol.

Similarly, overexpression of Csk, a negative regulator of Src, inhibited the transactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor in response to LPA or α2A-adrenergic receptor activation (13Hawes B.E. van Biesen T.

Although it is not yet clear how GPCRs activate Src, the non-receptor tyrosine kinases focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and PYK2 may participate in this process. The major autophosphorylation site of FAK or PYK2 provides a binding site for the SH2 domain of Src. Binding of Src to tyrosine-phosphorylated PYK2 or FAK enhances Src tyrosine kinase activity, which in turn phosphorylates PYK2 and FAK on specific tyrosine residues, and probably also phosphorylates additional signaling molecules such as Shc (14Dikic I.

In many cases, enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 is concomitant with extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) activation. We and others have previously shown that PYK2 plays an important role in MAPK signaling cascades mediated by elevation of intracellular calcium concentration (8Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P.

Activation of PYK2 by the GPCRs bradykinin or LPA stimulates ERK activation by a mechanism involving PYK2 autophosphorylation, association with the tyrosine kinase Src, recruitment of the Grb2-Sos complex, and subsequent activation of the Ras-MAP kinase signaling pathway (14Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (876) Google Scholar). In addition to GPCRs, PYK2 is activated upon cell adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) and is localized to focal contacts in certain cell types (23Sasaki H. Nagura K. Ishino M. Tobioka H.

PYK2 expression is more restricted than the nearly ubiquitous expression of FAK. Moreover, FAK and PYK2 are differentially activated and associate with distinct intracellular proteins. Several proteins have been shown to be exclusively associated with PYK2, including the ARF-GAP protein PAP (33Andreev J. Simon J.P. Sabatini D.D. Kam J. Plowman G. Randazzo P.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2338-2350Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and the Nirs, a newly discovered family of proteins (34Lev S. Hernandez J. Martinez R. Chen A. Plowman G. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2278-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, activation of ERK in response to various extracellular stimuli appears to be more tightly regulated by PYK2, as compared with FAK (19Cazaubon S. Chaverot N. Romero I.A. Girault J.A. Adamson P. Strosberg A.D. Couraud P.O. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6203-6212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that the targeting of PYK2 to focal adhesions is induced by integrins, protein kinase C (PKC), and histamine receptor activation. Translocation of PYK2 to focal adhesions is attributed to an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 and its association with the focal adhesion proteins paxillin and p130Cas. Integrin clustering, mediated either by binding of ECM proteins or by a PKC activation-dependent mechanism, is required for PYK2 translocation to focal adhesions. In addition, targeting of PYK2 to focal adhesions is required for ERK activation in response to histamine stimulation. These results suggest that PYK2 apparently links between GPCRs and focal adhesion-dependent ERK activation and can provide the molecular basis underlying PYK2 function at a point of convergence between signaling pathways triggered by ECM proteins and certain GPCR agonists. Monoclonal antibodies against paxillin and p130Cas were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Monoclonal antibodies against vinculin and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were from Sigma, monoclonal antibody against phosphotyrosine was from Update Biotechnology, Inc.

Polystyrene latex beads (1.1-μm diameter) and all other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. HEK 293 and HeLa cells from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml). Transfection of HeLa cells was carried out using LipofectAMINE according to the manufacturer's standard protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and HEK 293 cells were transfected using the calcium phosphate method as described previously (8Lev S.

Polyclonal antibodies against PYK2 carboxyl- or amino-terminal domains were raised in rabbits immunized with either glutathione S-transferase fusion protein containing amino acids 775–1009 or with MBP fusion protein containing amino acids 285–425 of PYK2, respectively. PYK2 expression constructs containing a point mutation either in the ATP-binding site or at tyrosine 402 were previously described (8Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M.

PYK2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains were amplified by PCR and fused in frame to the carboxyl termini of EGFP, by subcloning intoEcoRI and XbaI sites of pEGFP-C2. The sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of PYK2 amino-terminal domain (amino acids 2–425) were 5′-GGCGAATTCTCTGGGGTGTCCGAGCCC-3′ and 5′-CGCTCTAGATTACACATCTTCACGGGCAATGCC-3′, respectively. The sense and antisense oligonucleotide primers used for amplification of the PYK2 carboxyl-terminal domain (amino acids 606–1009) were 5′-GCCGAATTCAGTGACGTTTATCAGATG-3′ and 5′-GGCTCTAGATTACTCTGCAGGTGGGTGGGCCAG-3′, respectively. The GFP-tagged constructs were verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. Serum-starved HeLa cells were harvested by limited trypsinization (0.05% trypsin, 2 mmEDTA), washed in PBS containing 0.5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and then kept in suspension for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 1 mg/ml BSA and 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4. The cells were then seeded either on fibronectin (20 μg/ml) or poly-l-lysine (20 μg/ml)-coated dishes as described previously (35Hanks S.K. Calalb M.B. Harper M.C. Patel S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8487-8491Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). The cells were allowed to attach and spread for different times as indicated and then washed with ice-cold PBS, lysed in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 120 mm NaCl, 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EGTA, 20 mm NaF, 0.75 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and immunoprecipitated as described previously (34Lev S. Hernandez J. Martinez R. Chen A. Plowman G. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2278-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded into 100-mm diameter dishes in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Two days later, the cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 24 h and then stimulated with either histamine (100 μm) or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (1 μm) for different lengths of time as indicated. Where indicated the cells were incubated with 1.1-μm diameter fibronectin (50 μg/ml)- or poly-l-lysine (50 μg/ml)-coated latex beads as described previously by (36Grinnell F. Geiger B. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 162: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). For inhibition of PKC isozymes, the following PKC isozyme-specific inhibitors were used: for PKC α/β the myristoylated pseudosubstrate (N-Myr-Phe-Ala-Arg-Lys-Gly-Ala-Leu-Arg-Gln) (Biomol, catalog number P-205) was used; for PKC-ζ the myristoylated pseudosubstrate (N-Myr-Ser-Ile-Tyr-Arg-Gly-Ala-Arg-Arg-Trp-Arg-Lys-Leu) (Biomol, catalog number P-219) was used; for PKC-ε the octapeptide derived from the RACK-binding site for PKC-ε (Glu-Ala-Val-Ser-Leu-Lys-Pro-Thr) was used; and the scrambled analog (Leu-Ser-Glu-Thr-Lys-Pro-Ala-Val) (kindly provided by Dr. R. Nesher, Hadassah Medical Center, Hebrew University, Israel) was used as a control (37Yedovitzky M. Mochly-Rosen D. Johnson J.A. Gray M.O. Ron D. Abramovitch E. Cerasi E. Nesher R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1417-1420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The PKC-ε inhibitor and the scrambled analog were introduced into the cells by transient permeabilization as described previously (38Johnson J.A. Gray M.O Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (34Lev S. Hernandez J. Martinez R. Chen A. Plowman G. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2278-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HeLa cells were seeded on glass coverslips placed in 24-well dishes at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well. Where indicated, fibronectin (20 μg/ml)-coated coverslips were used. The cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature. The fixed cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min and then incubated for 30 min in blocking buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% BSA, 1% glycine, 10% goat serum, and 0.1% Triton X-100). After 1 h of incubation with various primary antibodies, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated either with Alexa donkey anti-mouse or with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or both, as indicated. The specimens were analyzed by Zeiss LSM-510 laser scanning confocal microscope at 488-nm and 543-nm excitations. In all cases 0.9-μm-thick images are shown. A laser-scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss-LSM 510) was used to monitor the translocation of GFP fusion proteins in response to diverse stimuli. Cells expressing GFP fusion proteins, on 25-mm coverslips, were incubated at 37 °C in phenol-red free culture medium containing 20 mm Hepes and 1 mg/ml BSA. The various drugs were applied to the cells during the scanning of GFP-expressing cells. The cells were imaged using a Zeiss Plan-Apo (1.3 NA) × 40 objective, with a 488-nm laser line for excitation and 505-nm long-pass filter for emission. Fluorescent signals were collected sequentially using the Zeiss LSM software time series function. The non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 is activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli including cell adhesion to ECM proteins and GPCR agonists. It has therefore been suggested to function at a point of convergence of integrin and certain GPCR signaling cascades. To explore this hypothesis experimentally, we characterized the tyrosine phosphorylation and the subcellular localization of PYK2 in response to integrin and the histamine GPCR activation in HeLa cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in response to integrin activation was determined by replating assay or by using fibronectin-coated beads as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Briefly, serum-starved HeLa cells were detached from their plates by limited trypsinization, left in suspension, or attached to poly-l-lysine- or fibronectin-coated dishes, as shown in Fig. 1 A. PYK2 was immunoprecipitated, and its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues was determined by immunoblotting utilizing anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. The results shown in Fig. 1 A demonstrate that cell attachment to fibronectin-coated dishes induced strong tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2, which was slightly decreased in a time-dependent manner. PYK2 was not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated in suspended cells or cells that were replated on poly-l-lysine-coated dishes. Likewise, poly-l-lysine-coated beads had no effect on PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation at shorter time points after cell stimulation, whereas fibronectin-coated beads induced rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 (Fig. 1 B). Stimulation of serum-starved HeLa cells with histamine also caused rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2, which was sustained for at least 30 min following cell stimulation (Fig.1 C).Figure 1Enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 in response to integrin or histamine receptor activation. A, serum-starved HeLa cells were subjected to replating assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” PYK2 was immunoprecipitated (IP) either from the suspended cells (Sus.) or from cells that were attached to poly-l-lysine (PLL)- or fibronectin (FN)-coated dishes for the indicated lengths of time. PYK2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with either anti-phosphotyrosine (upper panel) or anti-PYK2 antibodies (lower panel). Serum-starved HeLa cells either were incubated with fibronectin- or poly-l-lysine-coated latex beads (B) or were stimulated with histamine (100 μm) (C) for the indicated lengths of time, and PYK2 immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blotting as described above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To explore the subcellular localization of PYK2 in response to integrins or histamine receptor activation, we generated a series of constructs encoding enhanced GFP attached either to the full-length PYK2 (GFP-PYK2), to the kinase-deficient mutant PKM (GFP-PKM), or to the amino- or carboxyl-terminal domains of PYK2 (GFP-PN and GFP-PC, respectively) (Fig. 2 A). The properties of these GFP fusion proteins were characterized by Western analysis following transient transfections into HEK 293 cells. Whole cell lysates of HEK 293 cells expressing the various GFP-PYK2 constructs were probed either with anti-PYK2 or with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2 B, GFP-PYK2 and GFP-PKM were expressed as ∼150-kDa fusion proteins that could be easily distinguished from the PYK2 protein (116 kDa). The GFP-PN and GFP-PC were expressed as ∼75-kDa and ∼72-kDa fusion proteins and were recognized by antibodies against the PYK2 amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, respectively. Western analysis using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that GFP-PYK2 was heavily phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, similar to the native PYK2 protein, whereas GFP-PKM, GFP-PN, and GFP-PC were not detectably tyrosine-phosphorylated. These results indicate that GFP-PYK2 retains its ability to undergo autophosphorylation. The localization of GFP-PYK2 in living cells in response to integrin or histamine receptor activation was analyzed by confocal scanning laser microscopy. GFP or GFP-PYK2 were transiently transfected into HeLa cells and either subjected to replating assay on fibronectin-coated coverslips for 20 min at 37 °C or stimulated with histamine for 5 min at 37 °C. The confocal images shown in Fig.3 demonstrate that similar to GFP, GFP-PYK2 was evenly distributed in the cytoplasm of serum-starved cells. Integrin or histamine receptor activation had no effect on the cytosolic localization of GFP but induced a striking translocation of GFP-PYK2 to focal adhesion-like structures. These adhesive structures are large integrin aggregates to which the actin cytoskeleton is tethered, and numerous signaling components are recruited (38Johnson J.A. Gray M.O Karliner J.S. Chen C.H. Mochly-Rosen D. Circ. Res. 1996; 79: 1086-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 39Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Several structural proteins, such as vinculin and paxillin, are colocalized with integrins at focal adhesions. To confirm the localization of GFP-PYK2 at focal adhesions, an indirect immunofluorescence analysis was carried out by using anti-paxillin or anti-vinculin antibodies. The results shown in Fig. 3 Bdemonstrate that GFP-PYK2 is colocalized with vinculin and paxillin at focal adhesions following integrin activation, whereas no detectable colocalization of GFP was observed under the same experimental conditions. Similar results were obtained in response to histamine treatment (data not shown). To determine whether PYK2 catalytic activity is necessary for its translocation to focal adhesions, we have used the GFP-PKM construct and analyzed its localization in response to integrin activation. The results shown in Fig. 4demonstrate that similar to GFP-PYK2, GFP-PKM was translocated to focal adhesions. Although GFP-PKM-expressing cells usually exhibit round morphology and are easily distinguished from GFP-PYK2-expressing cells, we did not detect any effect of GFP-PKM on cell spreading or adhesion on fibronectin.

The permanent arrest of cell division is the most fundamental feature displayed by terminally differentiated neurons. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms whereby neurons become postmitotic. The murine embryonal carcinoma P19 cells differentiate into postmitotic neurons in response to retinoic acid treatment (1McBurney M.W. Reuhl K.R. Ally A.I. Nasipuri S. Bell J.C. Craig J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have isolated a 325-amino acid residue protein encoded in a cDNA sequence from a subtraction library of retinoic acid-treated P19 cells and termed this protein necdin forneurally differentiated embryonalcarcinoma-derived protein (2Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed in postmitotic neurons derived from P19 cells but not in transformed cell lines originating from neuroblastomas and pheochromocytomas (3Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The necdin gene is expressed in virtually all postmitotic neurons in mouse brain from early embryonic stages until adulthood, whereas necdin mRNA expression is undetectable in the proliferative progenitors (3Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 4Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Besides neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems, the necdin gene is expressed in skeletal muscle (4Uetsuki T. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 918-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), cartilage, and brown fat (5Gerard M. Hernandez L. Wevrick R. Stewart C.L. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), all of which contain postmitotic cell populations. In man, necdin is expressed ubiquitously in both neuronal and non-neuronal tissues (6Jay P. Rougeulle C. Massacrier A. Moncla A. Mattei M.G. Malzac P. Roeckel N. Taviaux S. Lefranc J.L. Cau P. Berta P. Lalande M. Muscatelli F. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), in which many postmitotic cells are expected to exist. Ectopic expression of necdin suppresses the growth of NIH3T3 fibroblasts (7Hayashi Y. Matsuyama K. Takagi K. Sugiura H. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and SAOS-2 osteosarcoma cells (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Necdin binds to the large T antigen at the NH2-terminal region that encompasses the retinoblastoma protein (Rb)1-binding domain (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Necdin also binds to adenovirus E1A, another viral oncoprotein that targets Rb. More importantly, necdin, like Rb, interacts with the transactivation domain of E2F1 and represses E2F-driven transcription. Therefore, necdin is functionally similar to Rb, although the two growth suppressors are structurally dissimilar. Unlike Rb, necdin binds to NH2-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and represses p53-dependent transcription of the p21 promoter (9Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Necdin does not counteract p53-induced growth suppression but does inhibit p53-induced apoptosis of U2OS osteosarcoma cells. These findings suggest that necdin contributes to the maintenance of the postmitotic state of neurons as a unique growth suppressor that targets both E2F1 and p53. Necdin has been characterized as a nuclear protein (2Maruyama K. Usami M. Aizawa T. Yoshikawa K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 3Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, a recent study using a new anti-necdin antibody has demonstrated that a considerable amount of the necdin protein is present in the cytoplasm of differentiated neurons (10Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that necdin not only acts as a transcriptional repressor in the nucleus but also exerts some functions in the cytoplasm of postmitotic neurons. In the present study, we have attempted to find out the cellular targets of necdin to elucidate the functional roles of this protein. We report that necdin interacts with NEFA and nucleobindin (Nuc), both of which are Ca2+-binding proteins that contain two EF-hand motifs and a leucine zipper domain. We characterize physical interactions between necdin and NEFA and demonstrate that necdin exerts modulatory effects on the distribution and function of NEFA. The GAL4 DNA-binding vector pGBT9, the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAD424, and adult rat brain cDNA library in pGAD10 vector were purchased fromCLONTECH. cDNA was generated from poly(A)+ RNA isolated from neurally differentiated P19 cells using a cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and inserted into pGAD424. Mouse necdin cDNA encoding amino acids 102–325 was cloned into pGBT9 (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). These vectors were introduced into yeast SFY526 strain, and transformants were grown on leucine- and tryptophan-deficient synthetic dropout medium plates. The colony lift filter assay for β-galactosidase activity was carried out as recommended by CLONTECH. Plasmid DNA from β-galactosidase positive colonies was recovered in Escherichia coli DH5α cells, and the sequence was determined with an automatic DNA sequencer (model 400; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE). For determination of binding sites, NEFA deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers, subcloned into pGAD424 vector, and co-transformed with pGBT9-necdin.

Interactions were scored for β-galactosidase activity by a colony lift assay. The reaction was evaluated three ranks with the time for appearance of blue colonies at 30 °C: +++, less than 2 h; ++, 2–6 h; +, 6–12 h; and −, remaining white over 12 h. cDNAs encoding Myc-tagged NEFA (amino acids 26–420) and NEFA (amino acids 26–241) using a 6 × Myc tag plasmid (a gift from Dr. M.

Combinations of expression vectors of pRc-necdin (amino acids 1–325), pRc-mycNEFA (amino acids 26–420), and pRc-mycNEFAΔCT (amino acids 26–241) were transfected into COS-1 cells and harvested 48 h after transfection (8Taniura H.

The complexes were pelleted with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), transferred to Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and detected with antibody 9E10 (or antibody C2) and peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (or anti-rabbit) IgG (Cappel) using chemiluminescence method (Renaissance; NEN Life Science Products). NEFA deletion mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction using synthetic oligonucleotide primers and inserted directionally in pGex.5X.1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins.In vitro binding assay for interactions between NEFA mutants and His-tagged necdin was carried out as reported previously (9Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, the necdin protein was mixed with GST fusion proteins (1 μg) bound to glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) in phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm glutathione and 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, incubated with antibody C2 and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, and detected by the chemiluminescence method. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). For45Ca2+ overlay, GST-NEFA fusion proteins (10 μg each) were transferred from 10% SDS-PAGE gel onto Immobilon membrane, which was incubated with 45Ca2+(calcium chloride in aqueous solution) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiographed (11Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1984; 95: 511-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Anti-NEFA polyclonal antibody (NET1) was raised in a New Zealand rabbit against purified GST-NEFA (amino acid 26–420) fusion protein. Initial immunization was with Freund's complete adjuvant (Difco), and the three subsequent boosters were with Freund's incomplete adjuvant (Difco). Mouse Nuc cDNA used was prepared from P19 cell mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and confirmed to be identical with the reported sequence (12Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Expression vectors for mouse Nuc (amino acids 1–455) (pRc-Nuc) and Myc-tagged Nuc (amino acids 26–455) (pRc-mycNuc) were transfected into SAOS-2 cells (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). To test the cross-reactivity, extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibody NET1 and anti-Myc antibody. Various mouse tissues from C57BL/6J mice at postnatal day 0 (P0) were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche) and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C to obtain the supernatant. The equal amounts of protein (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with antibody NET1 or anti-necdin antibody NC243 (10Niinobe M. Koyama K. Yoshikawa K. Dev. Neurosci. 2000; 22: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To detect an endogenous complex between NEFA and necdin, whole brain tissues from seven C57BL/6 mice at P0 were homogenized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.6% Nonidet P-40 and the protease inhibitors and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the supernatant. The supernatant (1 mg of protein) was applied to HiTrap NHS-activated affinity column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coupled with the IgG fractions of anti-necdin (C2) antiserum or anti-NEFA (NET1) antiserum, and bound proteins were eluted with 2 m glycine HCl (pH 2.5). Fractions of flow-through and eluate were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, rinsed with cold acetone, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibodies NET1 and NC243. P19 embryonal carcinoma cells were cultured and induced to differentiate by retinoic acid treatment as described previously (1McBurney M.W. Reuhl K.R. Ally A.I. Nasipuri S. Bell J.C. Craig J. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Postmitotic neurons were enriched by treatment with 5 mg/ml cytosine β-d-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 5 days (13Azuma-Hara M. Taniura H. Uetsuki T. Niinobe M. Yoshikawa K. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 251: 442-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, undifferentiated P19 cells and differentiated postmitotic neurons were stained with antibodies NET1 and NC243 by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method (Vector Laboratories) (3Aizawa T. Maruyama K. Kondo H. Yoshikawa K. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 265-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Undifferentiated P19 cells and enriched neurons were homogenized and dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer. For subcellular fractionation, enriched neurons derived from P19 cells were homogenized in 0.32 msucrose. The homogenate was pelleted by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g for 10 min (P1 fraction), at 12,500 × gfor 20 min (P2 fraction), and at 105,000 × g for 60 min (P3 fraction and supernatant). P1–P3 fractions were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline, homogenized, and dissolved in SDS-PAGE buffer. Cytoplasmic and nuclear soluble fractions were prepared from enriched postmitotic neurons as described previously (14Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3915) Google Scholar). Each extract (20 μg protein) was separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to Immobilon membrane, and immunoblotted with antibodies NET1 and NC243. For immunohistochemistry, tissues in ether-anesthetized C57BL/6J mice at P0 were fixed by transcardial perfusion of 4% paraformaldehyde solution in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). For light microscopy, the brains were immersed in the same fixative followed by cryoprotection with 30% sucrose and cut coronally at a thickness of 20 μm by a cryostat. The sections mounted on glass slides coated with gelatin were treated with 0.3% H2O2 in methanol for 30 min, 3% normal goat serum for 1 h and antibody NET1 (1:2,000) overnight. Immunoreactive materials were detected by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method using a Histfine Kit (Nichirei, Tokyo, Japan). For electron microscopy, coronal sections of the hypothalamus from P0 mouse were treated with 3% normal goat serum and stained by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method as above. The stained sections were postfixed with 0.2% osmic acid, stained with 2% uranyl acetate, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultra-thin sections were prepared and observed by electron microscopy. N1E-115 cells (a gift from Dr. H. Higashida, Kanazawa University) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. cDNA encoding NEFA (amino acids 1–420) was subcloned into pEGFP-N1 expression vector to obtain pEGFP-NEFA (CLONTECH). N1E-115 cells were grown in 90-mm dishes and transfected with pEGFP-NEFA or pEGFP (negative control) (16 μg) in combination with pRc-necdin (amino acids 1–325) and pRc-necdinΔN (amino acids 110–325) (11 μg) (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). NEFA-GFP fluorescence was observed by fluorescence microscopy. The culture medium was changed to serum-free medium 24 h after transfection and then to BSS buffer (14.2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 110 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 5.6 mm glucose) 36 h after transfection. Total cell extracts (4 × 105 cells) and the conditioned medium (3 ml of BSS buffer precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid) were prepared 48 h after transfection, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with antibody NET1. Fluoromicroscopic determination of intracellular Ca2+ with Fura-2 was performed as described (15Kudo Y. Ogura A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1986; 89: 191-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). N1E-115 neuroblastoma cells on the glass coverslip were incubated in BSS buffer and mounted on an inverted microscope (Model TMD, Nikon, Tokyo). The cells were treated with 5 mm Fura-2 acetoxymethylester (Dojin Chemicals, Kumamoto, Japan) for 60 min at 37 °C and subsequently tested with 40 mm caffeine for 30 s. Fluorescence images were obtained through an epifluorescence objective and a silicon-intensified target video camera (model C-2400-08; Hamamatsu Photonics, Hamamatsu, Japan) under ultraviolet illumination. The images were analyzed by a digital image processor (ARGUS-100; Hamamatsu Photonics). We first screened cDNA libraries prepared from neurally differentiated P19 cells for necdin-binding proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. In this assay, an NH2-terminally truncated mutant of necdin (amino acids 102–325) in GAL4 DNA-binding pGBT9 vector was used because the NH2-terminal domain of necdin exerts transactivation in the two-hybrid system (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two positive clones were isolated from ∼3 × 105transformants from neurally differentiated P19 cells. One clone contained a sequence (NBP-1) identical with a COOH-terminal part of mouse NEFA (GenBankTM accession number AJ222586; Fig.1). We then screened adult rat brain cDNA library and isolated one positive clone among ∼4 × 105 transformants. This clone has a sequence (NBP-2) identical with rat Nuc (CALNUC) (12Miura K. Titani K. Kurosawa Y. Kanai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 187: 375-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number Z36277). NEFA and Nuc are structurally similar Ca2+-binding proteins (Fig. 1 A). The interaction of necdin with NBP-1 or NBP-2 was as strong as that with SV40 large T antigen and was stronger than that with E2F1 (Fig.2 B). Although necdin functionally resembles Rb (8Taniura H. Taniguchi N. Hara M. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 720-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), neither NBP-1 nor NBP-2 bound to Rb.Figure 2Determination of the necdin- and NEFA-binding regions by the yeast two-hybrid assay. A, determination of necdin-binding region in NEFA. Combinations of pGBT9 vectors expressing NEFA deletion mutants and pGAD424 vectors expressing necdin (amino acids 102–325) were introduced into the yeast cells. The domains S, B, HAH, and LZare as in Fig. 1 A. B, determination of NEFA-binding region in necdin.

PA, domain rich in proline and acidic amino acids (amino acids 1–104); C, domain highly conserved between mouse and human. The binding activities were semi-quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because little is known about expression and functions of NEFA, we attempted to elucidate the physiological implications of the interactions between NEFA and necdin. For the analyses of physical interactions between necdin and NEFA, we isolated the full-length mouse NEFA cDNA from a cDNA library of neurally differentiated P19 cells. The nucleotide sequence determined was identical with that deposited in the data base (GenBankTM accession numberAJ222586) except for two nucleotide substitutions in the protein coding region at positions +53 (+1 at the beginning of the ATG start codon) (T to C, Met to Thr at amino acid position 18) and at +942 (C to T, silent mutation at amino acid position 314) (data not shown). These discrepancies might reflect strain differences. The cDNA sequence encodes total 420 amino acids including a signal sequence at the NH2-terminal region, which can be cleaved to generate the mature NEFA protein (amino acids 26–420) (16Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gross N.A. Gotz H. Henkel T. Karabinos A. Kratzin H. Barnikol H.U. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We used this NEFA cDNA for analyses of physical and functional interactions between NEFA and necdin in the following experiments. To determine the necdin-binding site in NEFA, we constructed various NEFA deletion mutants and analyzed by the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 2 A). NEFA (amino acids 26–420) inserted into the DNA-binding vector pGBT9 showed a false positive activity (data not shown), presumably owing to a domain having transactivation property. Thus, NEFA deletion mutants were inserted into the activation plasmid pGAD424, and necdin (amino acids 102–325) cDNA was inserted into pGBT9. The mature NEFA (amino acids 26–420), which lacks the signal sequence (16Barnikol-Watanabe S. Gross N.A. Gotz H. Henkel T. Karabinos A. Kratzin H. Barnikol H.U. Hilschmann N. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and its NH2-terminally truncated form (amino acids 213–420, NBP1) showed strong necdin binding activities. An NH2-terminal deletion mutant (amino acids 326–420) and a COOH-terminal deletion mutant (amino acids 26–241) failed to bind to necdin. The necdin binding activity of NEFA (amino acids 26–318) carrying incomplete second EF hand region was weaker than that of the mature form. NEFA (amino acids 214–358), which includes the two EF hand motifs and the intervening acidic region, bound to necdin with a strength similar to that of the intact form. Thus, the domain containing two EF hands (amino acids 214–358) was required for its interaction with necdin. We then determined the NEFA-binding domain of necdin by the same assay using various necdin deletion mutants (Fig. 2 B). The necdin deletion mutants lacking NH2-terminal regions (amino acids 83–325 and 102–325) bound to NEFA. An NH2-terminally truncated form of necdin (amino acids 110–325 and 167–325) failed to bind to NEFA. Although a COOH terminus truncated necdin (amino acids 83–292) interacted with NEFA, further COOH-terminal deletion to amino acids 83–279 lost the NEFA binding activity. These results suggest that the central region of necdin is indispensable for the interaction with NEFA. This region coincided with the region required for the interactions with the large T antigen (Fig. 2 B), E2F1, and p53 (9Taniura H. Matsumoto K. Yoshikawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16242-16248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). To examine whether the interaction between NEFA and necdin occurs in cultured cells in vivo, expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged NEFA (amino acids 26–420) and Myc-tagged NEFAΔCT (amino acids 26–241, a negative control) were transfected with a necdin-expressing vector into COS-1 cells (Fig.3 A). When the cell lysates were treated with an anti-Myc antibody, necdin was co-immunoprecipitated with Myc-tagged NEFA but was hardly pulled down with Myc-tagged NEFAΔCT (Fig. 3 B). Conversely, Myc-tagged NEFA was co-immunoprecipitated with necdin when the cell lysates were treated with anti-necdin antibody C2. The interaction between NEFA and necdin was analyzed byin vitro binding assay using GST fused to NEFA deletion mutants (Fig. 4). Purified His-tagged necdin protein was incubated with truncated GST-NEFA fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads (Fig. 4, A andB). Necdin bound to GST-NEFA deletion mutants (amino acids 26–420, 26–318, and 214–358), all of which include the two EF-hand motifs and the intervening acidic region (Fig. 2 B). The deletion mutant lacking amino acids 26–241 failed to bind to His-necdin. To investigate whether this interaction between NEFA and necdin is Ca2+-dependent, we carried outin vitro binding assay in a Ca2+-EGTA buffer containing 10−8–10−2mCa2+. However, the interaction between necdin and NEFA was not affected by Ca2+ concentrations tested (data not shown). We then carried out a 45Ca2+ overlay analysis to examine whether NEFA is capable of Ca2+ binding (Fig. 4 C). NEFA deletion mutants carrying the EF-hand region (amino acids 26–420, 26–318, and 214–358) bound to Ca2+, but deletion of the entire EF-hand region (amino acids 26–241) completely lost the Ca2+ binding ability. These indicate that NEFA was capable of binding to both necdin and Ca2+via the two EF-hand motifs and intervening acidic region. To determine the distribution and localization of endogenous NEFA protein, a polyclonal rabbit antibody (NET1) was raised against purified GST-NEFA (amino acids 26–420) fusion protein. Because mouse NEFA and Nuc have homologous sequences, the specificity of this antibody was tested by immunoblotting using SAOS-2 cells transfected with cDNAs for full-length NEFA (amino acids 1–420), Nuc (amino acids 1–455), Myc-tagged NEFA (amino acids 26–420), and Myc-tagged Nuc (amino acids 26–455) (Fig.5 A). The anti-Myc antibody detected myc-NEFA and myc-Nuc, whereas antibody NET1 recognized only NEFA and myc-NEFA, indicating that this antibody recognizes NEFA specifically. Using this antibody, distribution of the NEFA protein in various organs of P0 mouse was examined by Western blotting (Fig. 5 B,upper panel). NEFA immunoreactive bands (∼55 kDa) were detected in all the tissues examined. Tissue levels of NEFA were high in the lung, brain, skeletal muscle, and spleen. On the other hand, necdin was enriched in the brain and skeletal muscle, and small amounts of necdin were detected in the kidney, lung, and heart (Fig.5 B, lower panel). These results suggest that interactions between NEFA and necdin are of physiological significance particularly in the brain and skeletal muscle. We then attempted to demonstrate the NEFA-necdin complex in the brain of P0 mice by immunoaffinity chromatography using anti-NEFA and anti-necdin antibodies (Fig. 5 C). Both necdin and NEFA were detected in the eluate from anti-necdin or anti-NEFA immunoaffinity column. The affinity chromatography using preimmune rabbit serum failed to bind to the necdin-NEFA complex (data not shown). These results suggest that necdin and NEFA are present as a complex in the soluble fraction of the mouse brain. The intracellular distribution patterns of NEFA and necdin were examined by immunocytochemistry in cultured murine P19 cells, from which cDNAs for these proteins are isolated (Fig.6). NEFA was localized to the cytoplasm near the nucleus in undifferentiated P19 cells, and its immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm was increased when P19 cells were induced to differentiate into neurons (Fig. 6 A). On the other hand, the cytoplasm of undifferentiated"

The enzymatic properties of the novel α1,2-mannosidase IC were studied by expressing its catalytic domain in Pichia pastoris as a secreted glycoprotein. α1,2-Mannosidase IC sequentially hydrolyzes the α1,2-linked mannose residues of [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc to form [3H]Man6GlcNAc and a small amount of [3H]Man5GlcNAc.

They remove the four α1,2-linked mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc2, following cleavage of glucose from Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. Thus, α1,2-mannosidases provide the Man5GlcNAc2substrate required for GlcNAc transferase I that initiates formation of complex and hybrid N-glycans. They belong to class I α-mannosidases (family 47 of the glycosyl hydrolase classification (Ref. 4Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1991; 280: 309-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar)) that have been conserved through eukaryotic evolution. The α1,2-mannosidases are type II transmembrane proteins with amino acid similarity throughout their large C-terminal catalytic domains. They are inverting calcium-dependent glycosyl hydrolases that are inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine. However, they have different N-terminal regions and intracellular localizations. A class I α1,2-mannosidase localized to the ER1 of mammalian cells has been cloned (5Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K. Vandersall-Nairn A.S. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

It has the same properties as the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase, the structure of which has recently been determined by x-ray crystallography (7Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The ER α1,2-mannosidase removes a single specific mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 to form Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B that lacks the terminal α1,2-mannose from the middle branch of the oligosaccharide. Two class I Golgi α1,2-mannosidases, IA and IB, that are about 65% identical in amino acid sequence have also been cloned from mammalian cells (8Bause E. Bieberich E. Rolfs A. Völker C. Schmidt B.

These Golgi enzymes remove the four α1,2-linked mannose residues from Man9GlcNAc2 to yield Man5GlcNAc2. Their specificity is complementary to that of the ER α1,2-mannosidase since the mannose residue cleaved by the ER enzyme is the last residue removed by the two Golgi α1,2-mannosidases (12Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar).

This enzyme displays a distinct pattern of tissue-specific expression and trims Man9GlcNAc2 to Man5GlcNAc2, forming different high mannose oligosaccharide intermediates from those previously observed for mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by BioCorp (Montréal, Canada). The C-terminal peptide was synthesized and conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre (McGill University, Montréal, Canada). [3H]Mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc was prepared from rat liver and Man9GlcNAc from soybean agglutinin as described previously (14Jelinek-Kelly S. Akiyama T. Saunier B. Tkacz J.S. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2253-2257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Romero P.A. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1994; 4: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Man(9–6)GlcNAc2-PA oligosaccharides were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Otsu, Japan). Kifunensine, 1-deoxymannojirimycin, and swainsonine were obtained from Toronto Research Chemicals, Inc. (Downsview, Canada). ESTs encoding α1,2-mannosidase IC were identified by querying the NCBI dbEST data base with the yeast α1,2-mannosidase amino acid sequence (16Camirand A. Heysen A. Grondin B. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15120-15127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the tBLASTn algorithm. Most of the α1,2-mannosidase IC ESTs identified were catalogued in UniGene file Hs.8910. The ESTs encoding the 3′ end of the transcript were aligned, and clones T54452,AA437353, N30588, H67812, H68084, and W19722, spanning the length of the consensus sequence (1.3 kb), were obtained from Genome Systems Inc. and sequenced. Primers within the 5′ region of the consensus sequence (5′-ACCTGAACGTGAGCGGAGAAG-3′; 5′-CCTGGTTGCCAGA GAGTTCAG-3′) were used to screen a fetal brain cDNA library by PCR and hybridization (Genome Systems). The isolated clone (2.2 kb) contained 0.9 kb of additional 5′ sequence. In addition, a partially sequenced 2.9-kb EST clone (AA017666) was identified when the NCBI Human UniGene file was reorganized and listed clone sizes. The clone was obtained from Research Genetics and entirely sequenced. Human α1,2-mannosidase IC EST clone W19722 was labeled with [α-32P]dATP (3000 Ci/mmol) using the multiprime DNA labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Human multiple tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized with the α1,2-mannosidase IC probe according to the recommended protocol and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Rabbits were immunized with 0.5 mg of the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated synthetic C-terminal peptide NHSDSSGRAWGRH emulsified in Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted 5 weeks later with the same peptide in Freund's incomplete adjuvant. Serum was collected 12 days later. Antipeptide antibodies were affinity-purified (17Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 313-315Google Scholar) using a column prepared by coupling the peptide to cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The DNA sequence encoding the catalytic domain (amino acids 165–630) was amplified by PCR using a sense primer containing a KpnI site (5′-AAAGGTACCCAGGAGCCCCAGAGCCAAGTG-3′) and an antisense primer with a XbaI site following the stop codon (5′-AAATCTAGATCAGTGTCTGCCCCAGGCTCTG-3′). The amplicon was inserted into the KpnI/XbaI sites of pPICZα A (Invitrogen) in frame with the α-factor signal sequence yielding the expression construct pZαAHMIC493. The expression construct (10 μg) was linearized with PmeI and electroporated into P. pastoris strain GS115 (his4) (Invitrogen), and transformants were grown as described previously (11Tremblay L.O. Campbell Dyke N. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Clones expressing recombinant α1,2-mannosidase were identified by assays with [3H]Man9GlcNAc (18Herscovics A. Jelinek-Kelly S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Medium containing recombinant α1,2-mannosidase, with and without Endo H (New England Biolabs) treatment, was subjected to SDS-PAGE (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207509) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad Mini-Protean II apparatus. The proteins were then transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was detected using affinity-purified peptide antibodies visualized by the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Medium containing the recombinant α1,2-mannosidase was concentrated 10-fold using centrifugal filters (Millipore) and equilibrated in 100 mm PIPES, pH 6.8. The α1,2-mannosidase IC activity was assayed by incubating 2 μl of the concentrated medium with 5000–20,000 cpm of [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc in 50 mm MES, pH 5.9, 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3 at 37 °C. The amount of released [3H]mannose was assessed by the concanavalin A/polyethylene glycol precipitation method (18Herscovics A. Jelinek-Kelly S. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). To characterize the products formed from Man9GlcNAc, 14 μl of medium containing recombinant α1,2-mannosidase (10-fold concentrated) was incubated at 37 °C with 35,000 cpm [3H]Man9GlcNAc and 3.3 mmMan9GlcNAc in a total volume of 35 μl of 50 mm MES, pH 5.9, containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mmCaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3. The assay mixture was supplemented with fresh enzyme at 8 and 24 h. Samples (1/7) were analyzed at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 by HPLC on an Aminospherisorb column (Waters Corp.), as described previously (20Romero P.A. Saunier B. Herscovics A. Biochem. J. 1985; 226: 733-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To characterize the oligosaccharide isomers, 10 μl of medium was incubated with either 50 pmol of either Man9GlcNAc2-PA or Man8GlcNAc2-PA in 50 mm MES, pH 5.9, containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 10 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm NaN3. The assay mixtures were supplemented with fresh enzyme at 24 h. Samples (1/6) were collected at 0, 2, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h. The products were first fractionated according to size by HPLC on a TSK-Gel Amide 80 column (4.6 × 250 mm, TosoHaas), eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min with a 1:1 v/v mix of acetonitrile, water, 500 mm acetic acid, pH 7.3 (75:15:10, v/v/v) and acetonitrile, water, 500 mm acetic acid, pH 7.3 (50:40:10, v/v/v). The pH of the 500 mm acetic acid was adjusted to 7.3 with triethylamine. Oligosaccharides were monitored with a Varian model 360 fluorescent detector at an excitation of 310 nm and an emission of 380 nm. The oligosaccharide products were collected manually and lyophilized. The isomers present in each fraction were then resolved by HPLC on a MicroPak-SP C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm, Varian), eluted isocratically at 1 ml/min with 100 mmacetic acid containing 0.025% n-butyl alcohol adjusted to pH 4 with triethylamine. The isomers were monitored at an excitation of 320 nm and an emission of 400 nm. The identity of the products was determined by comparing their elution to that of standard Man9–5GlcNAc2-PA. The ORF sequence was amplified by PCR using a sense primer containing a HindIII site and Kozak sequence (5′-AAAAAAGCTTCCACCATGCTCATGAGGAAAGTG-3′). The antisense primer containing a NotI site was either 5′-AAAAAAAAGCGGCCGCGAGTGTCTGCCCCAGGCTCTG-3′ or 5′-AAAAAAAAGCGGCCGCTCAGTGTCTGCCCCAGGCTCTG-3′ (including a stop codon). The ORF amplicons were cloned into theHindIII/NotI sites of pMH (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in frame with the C-terminal hemagglutinin tag, yielding the tagged (pMHHMICT) and untagged (pMHHMICS) constructs. MDBK and MDCK cells were grown to 70% confluence in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 5 μg/ml gentamicin. Following trypsinization, 1.4 × 106 cells in PBS containing 20 mm HEPES were transiently transfected by electroporation with 10 μg of either pMHHMICT or pMHHMICS. The cells were grown overnight on coverslips in 35-mm dishes, and the following morning the medium was changed. At 24 and 48 h after electroporation, the cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (prewarmed to 37 °C) for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, permeabilized for 2 min with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS, and blocked with fetal calf serum for 1 h at room temperature. Following one wash with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 (PBST), the cells were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibodies diluted in PBST containing 3% BSA. The primary antibodies were mouse monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody HA11 (BAbCo) (1:1000 or 1:2000), affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-α1,2-mannosidase IC antibodies (1:50, 1:100, or 1:200), or affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-bovine β1,4-galactosyltransferase antibodies (1:200) (gift of Dr. Joel Shaper, John Hopkins, Baltimore, MD (Ref. 21Shaper N.L. Mann P.L. Shaper J.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1985; 28: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)). Following five washes with PBST, the primary antibodies were detected by incubation for 1 h with affinity-purified CY2 conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:400) or goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with rhodamine (tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate) (1:800) (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The cells were then washed five times with PBST and mounted onto slides in Immuno-Fluore mounting medium (ICN). They were viewed with a Nikon Eclipse 800 epifluorescence microscope and photographed with TMax P3200 film (Kodak). DNA sequencing was done by the Sheldon Biotechnology Centre (McGill University, Montréal, Canada) using the ABI prism dye terminator sequencing kit and ABI 373A sequencer, or with the Thermo Sequenase fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit (Perkin Elmer) and ALFexpress sequencer. Sequencing was also done by Bio S&T Inc. (Montréal, Canada) using the SequiTherm EXCEL II kit (Epicenter Technologies) and a Long Readir 4200 sequencer. Sequences were assembled into contigs with the DNASTAR SeqMan program (Madison, WI), and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned using the PileUp and Gap programs (version 10.0) from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (Madison, WI). Human ESTs encoding α1,2-mannosidase IC were identified by querying the EST Data Base as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The 1.3-kb consensus sequence obtained upon aligning the ESTs encoded the C-terminal region of the catalytic domain (216 amino acids) including two of the highly conserved class I α1,2-mannosidase amino acid sequence motifs, 991 base pairs of flanking 3′-untranslated region and a poly(A) tail. Thereafter, a cDNA clone encoding the entire catalytic domain (1.1 kb) as well as the 3′-untranslated region (1 kb) was identified by a PCR screen of a fetal brain cDNA library using primers within the 5′ region of the consensus sequence. In addition, a partially sequenced EST clone identified in the UniGene data base was completely sequenced (2.9 kb) and shown to encode the entire ORF. The α1,2-mannosidase IC cDNA (2.9 kb) is predicted to encode a 70.9-kDa type II membrane protein with a short cytoplasmic tail of about 22 amino acid residues, a transmembrane domain of 22 residues and a large C-terminal domain (Fig. 1). The C-terminal domain contains a proline-rich “stem” region (amino acids 45–164) not required for enzyme activity, followed by the catalytic domain (amino acids 165–630). The latter encodes class I α1,2-mannosidase signature motifs (see the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes server, available via the world wide web) and the nine invariant acidic amino acids and cysteine residues shown to be essential for the activity of the yeast class I α1,2-mannosidase (23Lipari F. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27615-27622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,24Lipari F. Herscovics A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1111-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Three potential N-glycosylation sites are located within the catalytic domain. α1,2-Mannosidase IC is about 54% identical to the human (X74837, AF027156), murine (U04299, U03458), and porcine (Y12503) α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB, and 38% identical to the human ER α1,2-mannosidase (AF145732, AF148509) amino acid sequences (5Gonzalez D.S.

Northern blot analysis revealed variable expression of a major 3.8-kb transcript in most tissues with the exception of lung, muscle, and pancreas (Fig.2). Remarkably high levels of the major transcript are expressed in the placenta. The ovary, liver, and placenta also expressed minor transcripts of about 2.4 kb, and several tissues expressed low levels of a 5.7-kb transcript. Both the transcript sizes and expression differ from those reported for human α1,2-mannosidase IA (3.8, 4.3 kb) and IB (7.5, 9.5 kb) (11Tremblay L.O. Campbell Dyke N. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) with the exception of the 5.7-kb transcript, but this same size transcript is different since it is expressed differentially in the tissues analyzed. The catalytic domain starting at amino acid 165 was cloned in the P. pastoris expression vector pPICZα A in frame with the α-factor signal sequence. α1,2-Mannosidase activity was detected in the medium 2 days following induction with methanol of yeast cells transformed with the resulting construct pZαAHMIC493. No activity was found in the medium of cells transformed with the empty vector pPICZα A. The secreted recombinant α1,2-mannosidase consists of a 55-kDa and a heterogeneous 67-kDa form. Treatment with Endo H gives rise to a single band of the expected size of 52 kDa (Fig.3). These results indicate that one glycoform only acquires core N-glycans, whereas the other contains outer chains with an average of about 16 residues per core structure, assuming all three sites are equally glycosylated. The enzymatic properties of recombinant α1,2-mannosidase IC were analyzed using [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc as substrate. The enzyme has a pH optimum of about 5.9 and requires the addition of calcium for maximum activity. Inhibition of the enzyme by preincubating with 50 μm EDTA is reversed by the addition of 10 mm Ca2+, but not by 10 mmMg2+, Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, or Fe2+. The α1,2-mannosidase IC activity is inhibited by the class I α-mannosidase inhibitors 1-deoxymannojirimycin (IC50 = 250 μm) and kifunensine (IC50 = 0.5 μm), but not by the class II α-mannosidase inhibitor swainsonine (TableI). Therefore, α1,2-mannosidase IC has all the properties ascribed to class I α1,2-mannosidases.Table IEffects of inhibitors on human α1,2-mannosidase IC activityInhibitorActivity1-aActivity is expressed as the percentage of [3H]mannose released from [3H]Man9GlcNAc in the absence of inhibitors (100 cpm).

Open table in a new tab The enzyme was incubated with [3H]mannose-labeled Man9GlcNAc, and the products obtained at different times were resolved by HPLC. The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the stepwise removal of mannose from Man9GlcNAc to form Man6GlcNAc and a small amount of Man5GlcNAc (Fig. 4). Man9GlcNAc incubated for 48 h with medium of yeast transformed with the vector alone was not hydrolyzed. To determine the order of mannose removal, the enzyme was incubated with Man9GlcNAc2-PA. The Man8–6GlcNAc2 intermediates were first fractionated according to size by HPLC (data not shown). Each oligosaccharide fraction was then further fractionated into its component isomers by HPLC on a reverse phase column. Hydrolysis of Man9GlcNAc2 yields primarily a single Man8GlcNAc2 isomer (about 90%), equivalent amounts of two Man7GlcNAc2 isomers, and a single Man6GlcNAc2 isomer that were identified by comparison with elution of standard oligosaccharides-PA (Fig.5, A–C). These results indicate that the terminal α1,2-linked mannose residue on the middle arm is the last to be removed. Since Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B is formed by human ER α1,2-mannosidase I, Man8GlcNAc2-PA isomer B was also incubated with α1,2-mannosidase IC. In this case the enzyme first cleaves the terminal mannose on the α1,3-branch of the substrate, yielding essentially a single Man7GlcNAc2 isomer (about 85%). Thereafter, equivalent amounts of two Man6GlcNAc2 isomers (Fig. 5, D and E) were formed by the hydrolysis of either of the two remaining α1,2-linked mannose residues. Thus, the order of mannose removal from Man8GlcNAc2-PA was identical to the order observed for the Man9GlcNAc2-PA. The full-length α1,2-mannosidase IC was expressed in MDBK and MDCK cells to determine its subcellular localization by indirect immunofluorescence. Punctate perinuclear Golgi staining was detected in cells 24–48 h after transfection with both the hemagglutinin tagged (pMHHMICT) and native (pMHHMICS) α1,2-mannosidase IC (Fig. 6). The staining pattern shows that α1,2-mannosidase IC is in the Golgi since it co-localizes with endogenous Golgi β1,4-galactosyltransferase. No immunofluorescence was observed with pre-immune serum, secondary antibodies alone, or cells transfected with the pMH vector. The α1,2-mannosidase IC gene contains 12 exons encoded by GenBank clonesAL031280 and AL020996. These clones overlap by 2.3 kb within the intronic region between exons 2 and 3. The gene is localized on chromosome 1p35.1–36.13 and spans 167 kb of genomic sequence between the markers D1S2843 and D1S417 on Gene Map 98 (26). The intron and exon boundaries of the coding region are identical to those found in the human α1,2-mannosidase IA gene, which spans 188 kb on chromosome 6q22 (UniGene Hs.2750). The reported genomic organization of the α1,2-mannosidase IB (11Tremblay L.O. Campbell Dyke N. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) localized on human chromosome 1p13 differs from α1,2-mannosidase IA and IC at a few positions within the ORF (Fig. 7), particularly at the N terminus, which is encoded by two exons. The present results demonstrate the existence of a previously unsuspected third mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidase derived from a distinct gene. This enzyme is capable of trimming high mannose oligosaccharides to Man5GlcNAc2 duringN-glycan biosynthesis. Human α1,2-mannosidase IC requires calcium for activity and is inhibited by 1-deoxymannojirimycin and kifunensine; thus, it possesses the characteristic properties of class I α1,2-mannosidases. The amino acid sequence of the catalytic domain is similar to previously described mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB, but the cytoplasmic tail and stem region sequence differ. Furthermore, α1,2-mannosidase IC displays a distinct tissue-specific expression pattern and order of α1,2-linked mannose removal (Fig.8). Human Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA, IB, and IC are encoded by independent genes on chromosomes 6q22, 1p13, and 1p35–36, respectively. Gene duplication occurring late in evolution probably gave rise to the mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidase gene family (27Gonzalez D.S. Jordan I.K. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 292-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) since the positions of the intron and exon boundaries within the gene are very similar. However, in both humans and mice these genes are independently regulated, thus giving rise to distinct patterns of expression (9Herscovics A. Schneikert J. Athanassiadis A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9864-9871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 441-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). α1,2-Mannosidase IC readily hydrolyzes three of the four α1,2-linked mannose residues of Man9GlcNAc2and slowly cleaves the remaining terminal α1,2-linked mannose residue on the middle branch (Fig. 8, upper section). The enzyme produces the same Man8GlcNAc2 isomer as α1,2-mannosidase IA (12Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and then forms equivalent amounts of two Man7GlcNAc2 isomers. One of the Man7GlcNAc2 isomers is also formed by recombinant murine α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB (12Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and purified rat Golgi α1,2-mannosidase (28Tabas I. Kornfeld S. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11655-11663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the other isomer (not produced by IA or IB) is formed by recombinant insect (29Kawar Z. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Jarvis D.L. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 347-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and fungal (30Yoshida T. Nakajima T. Ichishima E. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1998; 62: 309-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) α1,2-mannosidases, and is an inferred intermediate of purified porcine α1,2-mannosidase (31Bause E. Breuer W. Schweden J. Roeser R. Geyer R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 451-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The human Golgi α1,2-mannosidase activities are complementary to the human ER α1,2-mannosidase (5Gonzalez D.S. Karaveg K. Vandersall-Nairn A.S. Lal A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21375-21386Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 6Tremblay L.O. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) since they hydrolyze the terminal α1,2-linked mannose of the middle arm of Man9GlcNAc2 last. Hydrolysis of Man8GlcNAc2 isomer B by α1,2-mannosidase IC proceeds readily to Man5GlcNAc2 (Fig. 8,lower section). The mannose residues are removed in the same order observed for Man9GlcNAc2. However, this order differs from that observed with murine α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB (12Lal A. Pang P. Kalelkar S. Romero P.A. Herscovics A. Moremen K.W. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 981-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that α1,2-mannosidase IC has a unique specificity that differs from that of mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases IA and IB. Recent x-ray crystallographic studies of the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase indicate the active site of class I α1,2-mannosidases is located within an (αα)7 barrel with many non-conserved amino acids interacting with different parts of the oligosaccharide substrate (7Vallée F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Furthermore, mutation of one of these amino acids was demonstrated to change the specificity of the yeast ER α1,2-mannosidase (22Romero P.A. Vallée F. Howell P.L. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11071-11074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the variations in the order of mannose removal by the various class I α1,2-mannosidases is largely determined by the differences in non-conserved amino acids interacting with the oligosaccharide substrate within the barrel. The relative expression of mammalian Golgi α1,2-mannosidases with slightly different specificities can thus provide different high mannose oligosaccharide isomers with possible variation in recognition functions.

We hypothesized that activation of the Rb pathway would induce cell cycle arrest in primary neural precursor cells, independent of the proposed function of cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6 (CDK4/6) to sequester the CIP/KIP CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27 from CDK2. We expressed dominant negative adenovirus mutants of CDKs 2, 4, and 6 (dnCDK2, dnCDK4, and dnCDK6) in neural progenitor cells derived from E12.5 wild type and Rb-deficient mouse embryos. In contrast to previous studies, our results demonstrate that in addition to dnCDK2, the dnCDK4/6 mutants can induce growth arrest. Moreover, the dnCDK4/6-mediated inhibition is Rb-dependent. The dnCDK2 partially inhibited cell growth in Rb-deficient cells, suggesting that CDK2 may have additional targets. A previously proposed function of CDK4/6 is CKI sequestration, thereby preventing the resulting inhibition of CDK2, believed to be the key regulator of cell cycle. However, our immunoprecipitations revealed that the dominant negative CDK mutants could arrest cell growth despite their interaction with p21 and p27. Taken together, our results demonstrate that both CDK2 and CDK4/6 are crucial for cell cycle regulation.

A key developmental step in this process is the decision to undergo terminal mitosis. Several lines of evidence indicate that terminal mitosis and terminal differentiation are intimately coupled. First, cells in the mitotic layer of the developing retina induce expression of a retinal ganglion cell marker within minutes of the S phase of terminal mitosis (1McLoon S.C. Barnes R.B. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 1424-1432Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Waid D.K. McLoon S.C. Neuron. 1995; 14: 117-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Second, neural precursor cells transplanted throughout the developing cortex exhibit appropriate neuronal identify only if they had undergone terminal mitosis following implantation (3McConnell S.K. Kaznowski C.E. Science. 1991; 254: 282-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Third, sensory neurons override the G1 restriction point and undergo S-phase death in the absence of the neurotrophin, NT-3 (4ElShamy W.M. Fridvall L.K. Ernfors P. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1003-1015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The importance of terminal mitosis in neuronal development is underscored by the fact that failure to permanently withdraw from the cell cycle results in impaired differentiation and apoptosis. One key regulator of the cell cycle, the tumor suppressor protein pRb, has recently been implicated in terminal mitosis and neuronal differentiation. Mice nullizygous for Rb1 die by E15.5 from hematopoietic and neurological defects attributed to failed terminal differentiation (5Clarke A.R. Maandag E.R. Vam Roon M. van der Lugt N.M.T. van der Valk M. Hooper M.I. Berns A. Te Reile H. Nature. 1992; 359: 328-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar, 6Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T.

Nature. 1992; 359: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (1119) Google Scholar). By E12.5 onward, ectopic mitoses and massive cell death are observed throughout the developing nervous system. Studies examining neuronal development have revealed reduced expression of pan-neuronal genes as well as the nerve growth factor receptor TrkA, suggesting that Rb has an important role in differentiation (8Lee E. Hu N. Yuan S.S.F. Cox L.A. Bradley A. Lee W. Herrup K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2008-2021Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Examination of the expression of a neuron-specific transgene in Rb-deficient embryos revealed impaired neurogenesis in virtually all neuronal cell types examined (9Slack R.S. El-Bizri H. Wong J. Belliveau D.J. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Rb-deficient neural precursor cells exhibited a dramatic delay in their ability to undergo terminal mitosis (10Callaghan D.A. Dong L. Callaghan S.M. Hou Y.X. Dagnino L. Slack R.S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 207: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), indicating that Rb plays an important role in regulating the onset of terminal mitosis in progenitor cells. While Rb is thought to be a key regulator of terminal mitosis in neural precursor cells (reviewed in Ref. 11Slack R.S. Miller F.D. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), there is little evidence that activation of the Rb pathway is sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest in this cell type. Furthermore, although it is well established that CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 are all involved in cell cycle regulation, their precise roles and importance are still the subject of controversy. Indeed, previous studies examining the role of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) in cell cycle regulation have indicated that inhibition of CDK4/6, which function through the Rb pathway, is insufficient to induce mitotic arrest in several cell types. Specifically, a dominant negative mutant of CDK2, which sequesters cyclins A and E from endogenous CDKs, could efficiently induce growth arrest, while dominant negative mutants of CDK4/6 which sequester D cyclins, were unable to mediate cell cycle arrest (12van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). One interpretation of these results is that activation of the Rb pathway alone may not be sufficient to mediate arrest of cell growth. It has recently been suggested that CDK4/6, in its association with D cyclins, may have dual functions. First, these proteins inactivate Rb activity by phosphorylation (13Hinds P.W. Mittnacht S. Dulic V. Arnold A. Reed S.I. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1992; 70: 993-1006Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 14Ewen M.E. Sluss H.K. Sherr C.J. Matsushime H. Kato J.-Y.

Lees J.A. Desai D. Harlow E. Morgan D.O. Weinberg R.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 118-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Second, CDK4/6 may sequester the CIP/KIP CDK inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27, thus rendering them unavailable to bind and inactivate CDK2 (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). Recently, p21 and p27 have been shown to associate with CDK4/6 in a facilitatory CDK-cyclin interaction without inhibition of kinase activity (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 20LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In addition, as the INK4 CKIs p15, p16, p18, and p19 become expressed, they displace p21/p27, thereby releasing them to associate with CDK2, an interaction mediating G1 arrest (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar, 22Reynisdóttir I. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 492-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 23Reynisdóttir I. Polyak K. Iavarone A. Massagué J. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1831-1845Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Thus, it is believed that the inhibition of CDK2/cyclin E activity is the crucial step in cell cycle regulation. The notion of CDK2 as the major regulator of cell cycle progression, with CDK4/6 being merely facilitative has become quite pervasive (19Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). While this model is supported by a number of studies, it should be noted that the experiments using dominant negative mutants were conducted entirely on tumor cells and may not reflect the true mechanism of cell cycle regulation in primary cells. In view of the importance of Rb, as demonstrated by the severe nervous system defects in transgenic mice carrying null mutations for Rb, we hypothesized that activation of the Rb pathway alone would be sufficient to induce cell cycle arrest in primary neural precursor cells, independent of its function in the sequestration of the p21/p27 proteins from CDK2. To address this question, we have used primary neural progenitor cells derived from E12.5 wild type and Rb-deficient embryos. Dominant negative CDK mutants were introduced into these cells using adenovirus mediated gene delivery. In contrast to studies using cell lines, our results demonstrate that dominant negative mutants of CDK4 and CDK6 can effectively induce mitotic arrest in primary neural precursor cells, independent of the previously proposed binding and sequestration of p21 and p27. The fact that these CDK4/6 mutants are nonfunctional in cells that lack Rb demonstrates that the activation of the Rb pathway in itself is sufficient to cause cell cycle arrest in primary neural precursor cells. Rb-deficient transgenic mice, originally generated by Jacks et al. (6Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained on a C57BL6 genetic background. Mice were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction, as described previously (6Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar) using DNA extracted from tails for adults or from remaining embryonic tissue for cell culture studies. For timed pregnancies, mice were bred, and the time of plug identification was counted as day 0.5. For cultures of primary neural precursor cells, embryos were removed at E12.5. Neural progenitor cells were prepared as described previously (24Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1995; 15: 89-103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), with some modification (9Slack R.S. El-Bizri H. Wong J. Belliveau D.J. Miller F.D. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1497-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Cortices were collected from E12.5 mouse embryos, triturated, and aggregates were plated on poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated dishes. The culture medium consisted of Neurobasal medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, and l% N2 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.). In addition, basic fibroblast growth factor (25 ng/ml, Sigma) was added only upon plating. After 48 h, medium was replaced with the same medium, except l% N2 supplement was now replaced with 2% B27 (Life Technologies, Inc.). To culture Rb-deficient progenitor cells, the neocortex was removed from embryos at E12.5, triturated, and plated individually. After polymerase chain reaction genotyping, the appropriate wild type and Rb−/−littermates were selected for experimentation on day 2 after plating. Mature postmitotic neurons were prepared from E17 embryos, from which cortices were collected and triturated in culture medium (Neurobasal medium with 0.5 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin-streptomycin, l% N2 supplement, and 2% B27). As a second primary precursor cell population, rapidly proliferating neural stem cells were isolated from the striatum. At E12.5, the striatum was removed from mouse embryos and triturated to produce a single-cell suspension. Stem cells were plated at a density of 4 × 104 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 20 ng/ml basic fibroblast growth factor as described previously (25Vescovi A.L. Reynolds B.A. Fraser D.D. Weiss S. Neuron. 1993; 11: 951-966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). These cells were grown as spheres in suspension, and medium was added on day 3 after trituration. To passage, spheres were again triturated to obtain a single-cell suspension and replated at 4 × 104 cells/ml. Stem cells were used for experimentation after at least two passages and were not kept beyond eight passages. For BrdUrd labeling, cells were incubated in medium containing 10 μm BrdUrd for 18 h prior to staining. After a 5-min fixation in −20 °C 1:1 methanol-acetone, cells were washed three times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline and stained with antibodies directed against lacZ or FLAG. Following three subsequent washes, cells were stained with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to CY3. Prior to staining with anti-BrdUrd, cells were treated with 2 n HCl for 10 min to denature DNA and then neutralized with 0.1 mNa2B4O7 for another 10 min. Samples were washed three times for 5 min with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and l% bovine serum albumin prior to an overnight incubation at 4 °C with the primary anti-BrdUrd antibody diluted at l:25. After three 5-min washes, samples were incubated with a goat anti-mouse CY2-conjugated secondary antibody (Jackson Laboratories) for l h at room temperature and then washed three times for 5 min in phosphate-buffered saline prior to examination. The cDNA for the dominant negative mutants of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 were obtained from Dr. Ed Harlow (12van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and were epitope-tagged with FLAG at the C terminus (26Park D.S. Levine B. Ferrari G. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 8975-8983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The CDK mutants were subcloned into the XbaI site of the pAdlox vector (27Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that was recombined with the adenoviral backbone DNA and amplified in CRE8 cells as described previously (27Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The control vector carrying the Escherichia coli lacZ expression cassette, Ad5CA17lacZ(Ad[lacZ]), was constructed by Christina Addison in the laboratory of Dr. Frank Graham, 2F. Graham and C. Addison, unpublished data. McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. For virus infection, cortical progenitor cells were plated in four-well Nunc tissue culture dishes coated with poly-L-ornithine/laminin in 400 μl of plating medium. After 48 h, another 400 μl of medium containing the appropriate titer of the adenovirus recombinant vector was added to each well. Eighteen hours following infection, a half-medium change was carried out. The multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) indicates the number of plaque-forming units added per cell. Neural stem cells were infected with adenovirus recombinants 3 days after trituration. The appropriate vector titer was added directly into each dish and incubated for 6 h, after which a complete medium change was carried out. The cells were centrifuged at 1000 × g, and the pellet was resuspended in fresh medium. Samples were harvested 72 h postinfection for immunoprecipitation. For Western analysis, protein was harvested in lysis buffer A (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 250 mm KCl, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1 m EGTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 2 g/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mmsodium vanadate) for 20 min on ice, followed by a 10-min microcentrifuge centrifugation. Protein was separated on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking overnight at 4 °C in 5% skim milk, membranes were incubated in the primary antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature. After three 5-min washes in TPBS (100 mm Na2HPO4, 100 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5 n NaCl, 0.l% Tween 20), membranes were incubated for l h at room temperature in the secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (anti-mouse HRP, Bio-Rad catalog number 170-6516; anti-rabbit HRP, Bio-Rad catalog number 170-6515). Blots were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Neural stem cells expressing the dominant negative CDK mutants were harvested 72 h postinfection in lysis buffer B (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.0 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm PMSF, 5 g/ml aprotinin, 2 g/ml leupeptin, and 0.4 mm sodium vanadate) for 20 min on ice. Cell lysates containing 100 μg of protein, as well as a control sample containing beads in lysis buffer only, were rotated overnight at 4 °C with anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose beads. The beads were washed in lysis buffer three times and then eluted by boiling for 2 min in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer. The eluate was then used for Western analysis with antibodies directed against the appropriate cyclins and CKIs as noted in the legends to Figs. 8 and 9.Figure 9Dominant negative CDK mutants are associated with the KIP/CIP inhibitors p21 and p27. Neural stem cells were infected at 250 m.o.i. with Ad[lacZ], Ad[dnCDK2], Ad[dnCDK4], or Ad[dnCDK6] 3 days after plating. At 72 h following infection, cells were extracted, and cell lysates (100 μg of protein) and beads only in lysis buffer (control) were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2-conjugated agarose beads. The membranes were probed with antibodies against p21 (A) and p27 (B). Antibodies against FLAG detect FLAG-tagged dnCDK2 (34 kDa), dnCDK4 (34 kDa), and dnCDK6 (37 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The following primary antibodies were used: anti-β-galactosidase mouse monoclonal antibody (Promega, Z3789), mouse monoclonal M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, F3165) and beads (Sigma, A1205), biotinylated M2 anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma, F9291), mouse monoclonal anti-p27 (Transduction Laboratories, K25020), mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd (Becton Dickinson, 347580), and mouse monoclonal anti-Rb (PharMingen, 14001A). All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.: mouse monoclonal anti-p16 (sc-1661), rabbit polyclonal anti-p21 (sc-0397), rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK2 (sc-163), rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK4 (sc-749), rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK5 (sc-173), rabbit polyclonal anti-CDK6 (sc-177), mouse monoclonal anti-cyclin D1 (sc-6281), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D2 (sc-593), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin D3 (sc-182), rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin A (sc-596), and rabbit polyclonal anti-cyclin E (sc-481). Prior to assessing the role of the Rb pathway in cell cycle regulation of neural precursor cells, Western analysis was conducted to characterize the expression of the cyclin-dependent kinases, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors during the time course of differentiation. Stem cells, representing a highly proliferative population, and mature postmitotic neurons (E17) consisting of a quiescent population, were included at either end of time courses as a basis for comparison. First, the expression patterns of the CDKs were examined during the differentiation of cortical progenitor cells. As the population undergoes differentiation in vitro, CDK2 protein gradually becomes down-regulated to very low levels (Fig.1 A). Similarly, CDK4 and CDK6 (Fig. 1, B and D, respectively) are highly expressed in proliferating neural precursor cells and protein levels decrease as neurons develop. In contrast, the expression of CDK5, which is highly expressed in neuronal cells and not believed to function in the regulation of cell cycle (28Ino H. Ishizuka T. Chiba T. Tatibana M. Brain Res. 1994; 661: 196-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29Tsai L.H. Delalle I. Caviness V.S. Chae T. Harlow E. Nature. 1994; 371: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), is increased during the time course of differentiation, coincident with the appearance of postmitotic neurons in these cultures (Fig. 1 C). Thus, in cortical progenitor cells, CDK expression is such that the levels of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 become down-regulated to low levels while CDK5 is induced as neurons are generated. We next examined the expression of cyclins during the time course of neurogenesis (Fig. 2). The D cyclins, including cyclins D1, D2, and D3, are all expressed during neuronal differentiation in vitro; however, distinct differences in their regulation were apparent. Cyclin D1 is present at relatively low levels in proliferating cells but becomes up-regulated as cells undergo differentiation, with highest expression in differentiated, postmitotic neurons (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, cyclin D2 is highly expressed in proliferating cells but becomes down-regulated during differentiation, although detectable levels remain in neuronal cultures (Fig. 2 B). Cyclin D3 is readily detectable both in differentiated and undifferentiated cells (Fig. 2 C). Cyclin E, a CDK2 binding partner, is expressed throughout the time course of differentiation (Fig. 2 D). However, cyclin A, similar to the pattern observed with its binding partner CDK2, is expressed at high levels in proliferating cells and becomes down-regulated as neurons are generated (Fig. 2 E). While CDK activity is regulated at several levels including the differential expression of the cyclin binding partners as well as the expression of the kinase itself, CKIs also play key roles in cell cycle regulation during neural differentiation (30Kranenburg O. Scharnhorst V. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 31Gill R.M. Slack R. Kiess M. Hamel P. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 244: 157-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the expression of the INK4 CKI p16 as well as the CIP/KIP kinase inhibitors p21 and p27 (Fig. 3). p16 is expressed in neural precursor cells and is up-regulated as cells undergo differentiation (Fig. 3 A). p27 exhibits a similar expression pattern, showing low levels in proliferating neural precursor cells that increase as differentiation proceeds (Fig.3 C). In contrast, p21 shows highest levels in rapidly proliferating neural stem cells, which gradually decrease during the time course of differentiation to low or undetectable levels in postmitotic neurons (Fig. 3 B). The unexpected pattern of p21 expression, particularly the high levels in neural stem cells, is consistent with the suggestion that p21 has functions beyond that of inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase activity (20LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 847-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (1214) Google Scholar, 21Cheng M. Olivier P. Diehl J.A. Fero M. Roussel M.F. Roberts J.M. Sherr C.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). Western analysis indicated that Rb is present at high levels in proliferating neural precursors and decreases as neurogenesis proceeds (Fig. 4).Figure 4Expression of retinoblastoma protein during neurogenesis. Cortical progenitor cells were cultured from wild type E12.5 embryos and allowed to differentiate over 7 days in vitro. Self-renewing neural stem cells (St) and E17 postmitotic cortical neurons (N) cultured for 7 days were included for comparison. After days 0 (initial isolation), 1, 3, 5 and 7, protein was extracted, and 30 μg was loaded into each lane. Western blots were probed with antibodies against Rb.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine which CDKs are important in the regulation of cell cycle progression in primary neural precursor cells, we constructed recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying FLAG-tagged dominant negative mutants of CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 (dnCDK2, dnCDK4, and dnCDK6). These dominant inhibitory mutants have been previously described (12van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar) and contain a point mutation in the kinase region thereby rendering them inactive. These mutants retain the ability to bind cyclins, thus they will inactivate the function of endogenous CDKs by sequestering their required cyclins. To verify that adenovirus recombinants could express the CDK mutant proteins, neural progenitor cells were infected at 50 m.o.i., and Western analysis was carried out 72 h after viral infection. Under these infection conditions, the possibility of viral-mediated effects on cellular function and viability would be minimal (32Cregan S.P. MacLaurin J. Gendron T.F. Park D.S. Parks R.J. Graham F.L. Morley P. Slack R.S. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1200-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Western analysis using antibodies specific for lacZ, CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 confirmed expression of the appropriate CDK mutants in cortical progenitor cells (Fig. 5). Protein expression was also readily detectable by immunostaining with an anti-FLAG antibody (see below). Previous studies have shown that the dominant inhibitory mutant of CDK2 was capable of inducing growth arrest in several cell lines, whereas mutants of CDK4/6 were ineffective (12van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). As these studies were carried out in tumor cell lines, we questioned whether the activities of CDK4/6, which function through the Rb pathway, may be important in cell cycle regulation in primary neural progenitor cells. Wild type neural precursor cells were infected after 2 days in vitro, and BrdUrd incorporation was measured 72 h thereafter. Since viral infections at 50 m.o.i. resulted in less than 20% infection, cells were first stained with anti-FLAG to identify expressing cells followed by immunostaining with anti-BrdUrd (Fig.6 A). The number of FLAG-expressing cells that were BrdUrd-positive were counted, and the rate of BrdUrd incorporation was expressed as a percentage of infected cells. The percent BrdUrd incorporation was then compared withlacZ-expressing controls (Fig. 6 B). In contrast to lacZ-expressing cells, which showed a significant rate of BrdUrd incorporation (Fig. 6 A), there was very little BrdUrd incorporation in cells expressing dnCDK2 (Fig. 6 A). Quantification of these results indicated that 31 ± 3% BrdUrd incorporation was found in lacZ controls, whereas in dnCDK2 expressing cells, only 2 ± 1% were BrdUrd-positive. Consistent with previous studies (12van den Heuvel S. Harlow E. Science. 1993; 262: 2050-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar), our results indicate that dnCDK2 can efficiently induce growth arrest in cortical progenitor cells. We next questioned whether dnCDK4 and dnCDK6 could also induce growth arrest in neural precursor cells. Examination of cortical progenitor cells expressing either dnCDK4 or dnCDK6 revealed that the majority of cells transduced were growth arrested and did not enter S phase (Fig.6). Cell counts revealed that relative to 31 ± 3% inlacZ-expressing controls, cells expressing dnCDK4 and dnCDK6 exhibited only 8 ± 2% and 7 ± 2% BrdUrd incorporation, respectively (Fig. 6 B). These results indicate that dominant negative mutants, which specifically block the activity of CDK4/6, are sufficient to i"

Because AP-1 proteins regulate cellular responses to diverse environmental stimuli, we hypothesized that the conserved AP-1 motif (at −109) and flanking sequences in the human SP-D promoter contribute to the regulation of SP-D expression. The AP-1 sequence specifically bound to fra-1, junD, andjunB in H441 lung adenocarcinoma nuclear extracts. Mutagenesis of the AP-1 motif in a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter construct containing 285 base pairs of upstream sequence nearly abolished promoter activity, and co-transfection of junD significantly increased wild type but not mutant promoter activity. The sequence immediately downstream of the AP-1 element contained a binding site for HNF-3 (FOXA), and simultaneous mutation of this site (fox-d) and an upstream FoxA binding site (−277,fox-u) caused a 4-fold reduction in chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity. Immediately upstream of the AP-1-binding site, we identified a GT box-containing positive regulatory element. Despite finding regions of limited homology to the thyroid transcription factor 1-binding site, SP-D promoter activity did not require thyroid transcription factor 1. Thus, transcriptional regulation of SP-D gene expression involves complex interactions with ubiquitous and lineage-dependent factors consistent with more generalized roles in innate immunity.

Reid K.B. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 2Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The genes for both lung collectins and mannose-binding lectin are encoded in close proximity on human chromosome 10q. The pulmonary collectins, like the homologous serum proteins, are believed to contribute to innate (nonclonal) immunity and the host response to microorganisms (2Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). In addition, both SP-A and SP-D may contribute to the regulation of surfactant lipid homeostasis under certain circumstances in vivo (3Botas C. Poulain F. Akiyama J. Brown C. Allen L. Goerke J.

Acta. 1998; 1408: 296-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). SP-A and SP-D are secreted into the distal airways and pulmonary alveoli by Clara cells and type II pneumocytes. The expression of SP-A and SP-D by these cells is increased following many forms of pulmonary injury (2Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 177-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), and the rapid increase in SP-A and SP-D accumulation following intratracheal instillation of bacterial endotoxin suggests that they contribute to a pulmonary acute phase response (6McIntosh J.C. Swyers A.H. Fisher J.H. Wright J.R. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 15: 509-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). However, the regulation of these responses is not understood. We have previously shown that DNA sequences within 285 bp of the start site of transcription of the human SP-D promoter are able to confer glucocorticoid-responsive gene expression in H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells but not liver HepG2 cells (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that the proximal sequence contains information sufficient to direct lung-restricted expression. Sequence analysis of the proximal promoter suggested potential regulatory roles for a variety of ubiquitous and lung-restricted transcription factors. In considering the potential contributions of these regulatory motifs to SP-D gene regulation, we initially focused our attention on the AP-1 consensus (5′-TGAGTCA-3′) at −109 bp relative to the start site of transcription (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Preliminary footprinting assays showed preferential protection of this motif and its contiguous flanking sequences by nuclear extracts from H441 cells. In addition, an identical AP-1 motif is spatially conserved in the rat and mouse promoters (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Lawson P.R. Perkins V.C. Holmskov U. Reid K.B. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol.

Immunol. 1994; 153: 173-180PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig.1). Because alterations in the composition of the AP-1 complex regulate a wide variety of transcriptional events associated with cellular differentiation and the response to environmental stimuli including cell injury, inflammation, and the systemic acute phase response, we hypothesized that the AP-1 motif plays important roles in the regulation of SP-D expression. The flanking regions of the conserved AP-1 motif also contain sequences resembling binding sites for factors known to regulate respiratory epithelial cell differentiation and the expression of various secreted lung proteins including Clara cell-specific protein (CCSP) and SP-A, -B, and -C (11Perl A.K. Whitsett J.A. Clin. Genet. 1999; 56: 14-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). These include potential binding sites for the homeodomain-containing protein, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1), and the forkhead/winged helix transcription factors, such as HNF-3 (FOXA). Previous studies have shown that TTF-1 and HNF-3 can act in combinatorial fashion with other ubiquitous and cell-specific transcription factors to regulate lung-specific genes (12Hackett B.P. Bingle C.D. Gitlin J.D. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 51-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 13Whitsett J.A. Glasser S.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1408: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because pulmonary cells known to express TTF-1 and forkhead box proteins secrete SP-D in vivo, we hypothesized that these nuclear factors similarly contribute to the regulation of SP-D expression. To characterize the regulatory role(s) of the putative AP-1 element and other potential regulatory motifs in its conserved flanking sequences, we examined the interactions of oligomers containing these sequences with H441 nuclear proteins using electrophoretic mobility shift and antibody supershift assays. We also selectively mutated these sequences and compared the activity of wild type and mutant constructs in transient transfection assays. These studies are the first to demonstrate specific cis-acting elements in the human SP-D gene. The regulatory profile is consistent with more generalized roles in pulmonary and nonpulmonary host defense. An approximately 7-kilobase EcoRI fragment of the previously described human genomic clone (H5), designated H5E7, containing 5′ hSP-D sequence was isolated and subcloned into pGEM3Z as described previously (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Most studies employed a XbaI/SacI fragment of the hSP-D gene containing 285 bp immediately upstream of the start site of transcription (XS285 or XS) (Fig. 1). NCI-H441 human lung adenocarcinoma cells were obtained as a gift from Dr. A. Gazdar (University of Texas Medical Center, Dallas, TX) and propagated as described previously (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). HeLa (CCL-2), A549 (CCL-185), and HepG2 (HB-8065) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained under recommended conditions of cell culture. Several wild type and mutant oligomers were synthesized (DNA International) for this study (see Table I). In addition, oligomers corresponding to the CCSP upstream and/or downstream HNF-3-binding sites (14Bingle C.D. Gitlin J.D. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), FREAC2 (15Pierrou S. Hellqvist M. Samuelsson L. Enerback S. Carlsson P.

Mendelson C.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1082-1093PubMed Google Scholar). Commercial consensus oligomers to AP-1 and AP-2 were purchased from Promega, and commercial Sp1, E box, and GATA (1Eggleton P. Reid K.B. Curr. Opin.

Forward and reverse directed oligomers were synthesized, each containing a mutated consensus sequence. pXS was linearized outside the multiple cloning site by digestion with ScaI and used as template for thermal cycling reactions. Approximately 200 ng of template DNA, 200 ng of forward or reverse mutagenesis oligomer, and 200 ng of an oligomer directed to the appropriate SP6 or T7 RNA polymerase site in pGEM were combined with 200 μm dNTPs (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Fisher) in buffer supplied with the enzyme. 20–25 cycles were performed, each consisting of 1 min at 95 °C (denaturing), 1 min at 45 °C (annealing), and 2 min at 70 °C (extension). Resultant DNA fragments were gel purified using the QIA Quick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The 5′ and 3′ fragments of the mutated promoter DNA were joined together by extension thermal cycling, using an overlapping internal oligomer sequence and oligomers to the flanking SP6 and T7 sites for amplification. The wild type or final mutated fragment was subcloned into pSK-CAT as described previously (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or pBLCAT3 (plasmid backbone of pTK-CAT), and the orientation was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. All SP-D sequences terminated at aSacI site within the untranslated first exon and were numbered from the start site of transcription (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from cultured cell lines using a rapid mini-extraction technique (19Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3916) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were scraped into 7 ml of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, and centrifuged. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, transferred to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and recentrifuged. The resultant pellet was thoroughly resuspended in 400 μl of ice-cold Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 15 min. Nonidet P-40 (Sigma) was then added to a final concentration of 0.625%, and the sample was vortexed for 10 s prior to microcentrifugation at 1350 rpm in a Hermle Z233M centrifuge for 30 s at 4 °C. The resultant nuclear pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold Buffer C (20% glycerol, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmEGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The pellet was vigorously agitated on a rocker platform for 15 min at 4 °C and then clarified by centrifugation for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge (12,000 rpm). The supernatant was transferred to a chilled fresh tube, and the protein content was analyzed by dye binding assay. Yields were in the range of 300–500 μg/75-cm2 flask. Once quantified, the extract was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Gel retardation assays were performed by a modification of a method employed by Bingle and co-workers (20Toonen R.F.G. Gowan S. Bingle C.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–10 μg of nuclear extract in the absence or presence of 50–100-fold excess of competitive inhibitor was incubated for 10 min at 18 °C in a buffer consisting of 1 mmMgCl2, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 40 mmKCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm EGTA, 4% (w/v) Ficoll (Sigma), and 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC) (Sigma). Approximately 1.75 pmol of kinase-labeled double-stranded oligomer were then added, and the incubation was continued for 10 min. For supershift experiments purified antibodies were then added to samples at the optimal concentration and incubated for an additional 10 min. Antibodies tojun or fos proteins, GATA-6, Sp1, and Sp3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; antibodies to HNF-3α and HNF-3β were from Dr. Robert Costa (University of Illinois, Chicago, IL), and the antibody to TTF-1 was provided by Dr. Roberto Di Lauro (Stazione Zoologica “Anton Dohrn,” Naples, Italy). Prior to loading on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 110 volume of loading buffer (250 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% bromphenol blue, 0.2% xylene cyanol, and 40% glycerol) was added to each sample. Complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2.5–3 h, 250 V, 4 °C) using nondenaturing 4% bisacrylamide, 2.5% glycerol gels, and 0.5× TBE running buffer. Gels were dried to 3MM paper (Whatman) and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Eastman Kodak) for a period of 1 h to 1 week with an intensifying screen. In brief, for experiments characterizing the promoter activity of 5′ deletion or mutant constructs, H441 target cells (5 × 105) were plated on 35-mm plates in RPMI medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) newborn calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), allowed to attach overnight, and washed twice with RPMI devoid of phenol red (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The cells were transfected with 2 μg of CAT reporter construct and 1 μg of pCMV-β-gal (Promega) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in the absence of serum. Parallel transfections were performed using pSK-CAT vector controls and/or a glucocorticoid-responsive control promoter, pMSG-CAT (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Concentrated serum-containing medium was then added, and the cells were incubated overnight. Cells were harvested at various times up to 48 h with one medium change at 24 h when needed. Where indicated, a previously optimized concentration of dexamethasone (Dex; final concentration, 50 nm) was added to the concentrated medium and with the succeeding medium change. All assays were performed on duplicate or triplicate plates. For some experiments, similar studies were performed using HeLa or HepG2 cells. Cell layers were harvested, and transient transfection assays were performed using protein equivalent amounts of cell extract using and CAT promoter constructs as described previously (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Prior to each transfection the quality of the plasmids was reassessed by gel electrophoresis. CAT activity was measured by phase partitioning and thin layer chromatography, followed by autoradiography. To quantify relative acetylation, gels were exposed to a phosphorimaging screen (Storage phosphor Screen GP; Eastman Kodak Co.) and scanned using a STORM image reader (Molecular Dynamics). To prepare figures the data files were imported to ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics) and transferred to Illustrator (Adobe) as unmanipulated TIFF files. Each assay was performed in duplicate, and each figure is representative of at least three experiments. When indicated, conversion data were normalized to β-galactosidase activity as described previously (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ThejunD expression plasmid (HA1-junD) was a gift of Dr. Lester Lau (University of Illinois). The fra-1 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Curran (St. Jude's Hospital, Memphis, TN). Expression plasmids for c-fos and c-jun were a gift of Dr. G. Doyle (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). These were constructed by inserting the nuclear factor cDNA in the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA; contains the cytomegalovirus immediate-early promoter, a polylinker, and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence). The pCMV-human HNF-3α cDNA (21Bingle C.D. Gowan S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1307: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and TTF-1 cDNA (20Toonen R.F.G. Gowan S. Bingle C.D. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 467-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were gifts from Dr. Colin Bingle (University of Sheffield Medical School, Sheffield, UK). Dr. James Darnell (Rockefeller University, New York, NY) kindly provided the rat HNF-3α and HNF-3β cDNAs. Transfections were performed using up to 1 μg of pcDNA3 containing the desired cDNA or an equivalent weight of the pcDNA3 vector. For some experiments, expression of mRNA or protein encoded by the cotransfected plasmid was confirmed by Northern hybridization or gel supershift assays, respectively. A labeled SP-D oligomer (20-mer) containing the AP-1 sequence (TableI, Oligo1) showed binding to proteins in H441 nuclear extracts (Fig.2 A, lane 2). The major complex was specific as demonstrated by competition with unlabeled Oligo1 (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) or a commercial AP-1 oligomer (Promega pAP-1; Fig. 2 A, lane 4). There was no competition by a mutant oligomer with base substitutions at six of seven positions (Fig. 2 A, lane 5; Oligo1m, Table I) or an unrelated oligomer (AP-2; Fig.2 A, lane 6) with a similar base composition. Because surrounding sequences can influence the binding of specific AP-1 proteins (22Ryseck R.P. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 533-542PubMed Google Scholar), we also examined the interactions of H441 nuclear proteins with a commercial AP-1 consensus oligomer (pAP-1) (Fig.2 B). Binding was competed by Oligo1 or pAP-1 (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 4), but not by Oligo1m or AP-2 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 5 and 6). Binding was also competed with a smaller SP-D AP-1 oligomer (Oligo 2, Table I) (data not shown). Thus, the data demonstrate that the SP-D AP-1 motif can specifically bind to nuclear proteins expressed by H441 cells. Complexes of comparable mobility were also identified using nuclear extracts of an SP-D producing lung adenocarcinoma cell line (NCI-H969) (23Persson A. Moeller P. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 153 (abstr.): 109Google Scholar) and freshly isolated rat type II cells (data not shown). AP-1 complexes consist of homodimers of two jun family members (c-jun, junB, and junD), or heterodimers of one jun family member with c-fos or one of the fos-related proteins (fosB, fra-1, and fra-2) (24Ransone L.J. Verma I.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1990; 6: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Supershift assays using pan-fosand pan-jun antibodies and radiolabeled Oligo1 incubated with H441 nuclear extracts demonstrated binding of components immunologically related to jun and fos family members (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and6). In other experiments, stronger supershift bands were obtained with the pan-jun antibody (data not shown). Supershift assays with antibodies for specific fos andjun proteins demonstrated relatively strong and specific supershift bands with antibodies to junB, junD, and fra-1 (lanes 3, 5, and 9) and much weaker bands for c-jun, c-fos, orfra-2 (lanes 4, 7, and 10), and no detectable signal for fosB (lane 8). Thefra-1, junD, and junB supershift bands comigrated with the major bands detected using the pan-fosand pan-jun antibodies but had a reproducibly lower mobility than the faint complexes formed with antibodies to c-fos and c-jun. Consistent with the finding shown in Fig. 2, binding was blocked by competition with the commercial AP-1 oligomer or Oligo1 but not by Oligo1m (data not shown). Thus, the data indicate that selected AP-1 family members are binding to the SP-D sequence and suggest that the binding of fra-1,junD, and junB reflects the predominating species of AP-1 proteins in H441 cells rather than an intrinsic property of the AP-1-binding sequence. Because prior studies have describedfra-1 and junB but not junD in H441 cells (25Sawaya P.L. Stripp B.R. Whitsett J.A. Luse D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3860-3871Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), we performed Northern hybridization assays to further confirm the presence of junD. Although there was a predominance of junB message, junD mRNA was also identified (data not shown). To study the potential functional consequences of AP-1 binding, we employed a transient transfection assay utilizing H441 lung adenocarcinoma cells in conjunction with wild type and mutant CAT reporter constructs. Mutagenesis of the conserved AP-1 motif in pXS (pXSm) resulted in a marked decrease in both basal and promoter activity (Fig.4 A). The reduction in normalized basal activity was 3.9 ± 0.9 in five separate experiments. Decreases in promoter activity were also observed when the mutation was examined within the context of two shorter restriction fragments, pPS and pFS (Fig. 1; data not shown). Dex increases the production of SP-D in lung tissue in vivoand in vitro, and these effects are mediated at the level of transcription (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, the stimulation of pXS activity achieved with Dex is indirect (e.g. requires 24–48 h for maximal stimulation) and does not involve direct interactions of glucocorticoid receptor with classical response elements in the proximal promoter (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We therefore sought to determine whether mutation of the AP-1 could inhibit the 2–3-fold higher levels of promoter activity observed in the presence of glucocorticoids. As shown in Fig. 4 A, mutation of the AP-1 element (pXSm) markedly decreased promoter activity in the absence or presence of Dex. Although the residual activity of pXSm showed a detectable increase in the presence of Dex, the pSK vector control often showed a similar increase (Fig.4 A, compare pSK with pXSm). We occasionally observed a slight decrease in mobility and intensity of the complexes formed on Oligo1 in the presence of Dex; however, there were no major or reproducible effects on AP-1 binding (data not shown). Thus, the effects of Dex do not appear to be secondary to increased occupancy of the AP-1 site. To further examine the potential modulatory roles of specific AP-1 proteins we performed cotransfection studies using the selected CAT reporter constructs and jun and fosexpression constructs. The activities of pXS were increased 3–4-fold by cotransfection with junD cDNA in the absence or presence of Dex, and mutation of the AP-1 site markedly decreased basal and glucocorticoid stimulated expression (Fig. 4 B). The effects of junD and Dex appeared additive rather than synergistic. Cotransfection with junD did not alter the activity of a pMSG-CAT control plasmid, which lacks a known AP-1 site, consistent with specific stimulation. Slightly lower specific stimulation was observed with fra-1 cotransfection, but inhibition was reproducibly observed with c-fos or c-jun (data not shown). Plasmids containing the mutated AP-1 showed some residual modulation by co-transfected AP-1 proteins under conditions where there was no significant alteration in the activity of control plasmids (Fig.4 B and data not shown). However, the only other sequence in the proximal promoter with significant homology to an AP-1 consensus (−215, TGAGTTCA) (7Rust K. Bingle L. Mariencheck W. Persson A. Crouch E.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1996; 14: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) did not bind AP-1 proteins in supershift assays using either pan-jun or pan-fos antibodies (data not shown), suggesting that the residual modulatory effects are secondary to interactions of AP-1 proteins with components of the transcriptional initiation complex (26Martin M.L. Lieberman P.M. Curran T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2110-2118Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or other potential regulatory factors such as C/EBPβ (27Klampfer L. Lee T.H. Hsu W. Vilcek J.

https://openalex.org/W2142805203,"Suppression of the gastrin gene in human colon cancer cells by stably expressing antisense (AS) gastrin RNA results in significant growth suppression of AS cells. To understand mechanisms mediating the growth effects of autocrine gastrins, differential expression of transcripts by AS and control (C) clones of a representative cell line (HCT-116) was analyzed to identify target genes of autocrine gastrins. Six differentially expressed transcripts were confirmed and sequenced. Of these, the RNA and protein levels of cytochrome c oxidase (COX) Vb were significantly higher in C versus AS cells. The expression of COX Vb by colon cancer cells was proportional to the expression of gastrin. Higher levels of COX Vb coprecipitated with cytochrome c in the mitochondria of C versus AS cells. Treatment of mitochondria with digitonin resulted in a 2-fold higher release of cytochrome c from AS versus C mitochondria. As a corollary, the cytosolic levels of cytochrome c were significantly higher in AS versus C cells, which correlated with approximately 2- and approximately 3-fold higher activation of caspase-9 and -3, respectively, in AS versus C cells in response to camptothecin. Thus, autocrine gastrins may support growth/survival of cells by up-regulating COX Vb, which may decrease the sensitivity of the cancer cells to apoptotic stimuli by increasing retention of cytochrome c in mitochondria."

Myosin-V (or its relatives) is one factor shown to be responsible for the actin-based organelle motility (16Wu X. Bowers B. Rao K. Wei Q. Hammer J.A.R. J.

This myosin has recently been shown to interact with kinesin (19Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Motor proteins transport organelles by anchoring to them via some type of linkage. For minus-end-directed MT-based motility, it has been proposed that cytoplasmic dynein binds to organelles via direct lipid linkage (20Lacey M.L. Haimo L.T. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1994; 28: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), via intermediates such as the dynactin complex (21Vaughan K.T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1507-1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar), or via an Arp1-linked receptor using a classical actin-membrane binding mechanism such as spectrin-ankyrin (22Beck K.A. Nelson W.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 23Burkhardt J.K. Biochim. Biophys.

For myosin-V, little information is known about its membrane anchor. In the case of kinesin, a membrane protein (kinectin) has been identified to bind kinesin to membrane organelles (25Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Kinectin is a 160-kDa integral membrane protein identified as a membrane anchor essential for kinesin-dependent organelle motility in vitro (25Toyoshima I., Yu, H. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 1121-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 26Kumar J., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A shorter 120-kDa kinectin can bind the 160-kDa kinectin as a heterodimer with the amino-terminal trans-membrane domain of the 160-kDa kinectin anchoring to organelles (27Kumar J. Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). An anti-kinectin monoclonal antibody, VSP4D, inhibited cytoplasmic dynein as well as kinesin functions in both the motor-membrane binding and the organelle motility assays in vitro (26Kumar J., Yu, H. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1995; 267: 1834-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Plus- and minus-end-directed organelle motility have also been shown to be coupled in vivo (28Sheetz M.P. Yu H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 329-334Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Therefore, kinectin has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the organelle motility (28Sheetz M.P. Yu H. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 7: 329-334Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Recently, the kinesin tail, where the cargo-binding domain has been postulated has been reported to activate motor activities of the kinesin head and hereby regulate organelle motility (29Coy D.L. Hancock W.O. Wagenbach M. Howard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 30Friedman D.S. Vale R.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 31Kirchner J. Seiler S. Fuchs S. Schliwa M. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4404-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). On the other hand, organelles that normally are driven by cytoplasmic dynein are not affected in kinesin disruption studies (32Burkhardt J.K. Echeverri C.J. Nilsson T. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 469-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 33Kraemer J. Schmitz F. Drenckhahn D. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 265-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These observations, together with a lack of clearer understanding of the kinectin-motor interaction, support the hypothesis that kinectin might simply anchor kinesin to organelle membrane without an active role in organelle motility. Previous efforts to characterize the kinectin-kinesin interaction with various affinity methods have not been successful, since the interaction measured in vitroseems always weaker than expected (34Skoufias D.A. Cole D.G. Wedaman K.P. Scholey J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1477-1485Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,35Yu H. Toyoshima I. Steuer E.R. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20457-20464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 2L.-L. Ong, A. P. C. Lim, C. P. N. Er, S. A. Kuznetsov, and H. Yu, unpublished observations. This has led some to question whether kinectin is truly a kinesin receptor on organelles (36Burkhardt J.K. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 127-131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To address these questions and understand the mechanism of the motor binding to organelles, we have characterized the interacting domains on human kinectin and three known members of the human conventional kinesin family using in vitro and in vivo assays. The kinectin-binding domains on kinesin partially overlap the head-binding domain on the kinesin tail that has been reported to regulate the kinesin motor activities (29Coy D.L. Hancock W.O. Wagenbach M. Howard J. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). The kinesin-binding domain on kinectin resides in the COOH terminus, and the overexpression of the kinectin-kinesin binding domains in vivo disrupts the kinectin-dependent organelle motility. The kinectin-binding domains also overlap the reported myosin-Va binding domain on kinesin (19Huang J.D. Brady S.T. Richards B.W. Stenolen D. Resau J.H. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Nature. 1999; 397: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Further, the kinesin-binding domain on kinectin can enhance the microtubule-stimulated kinesin-ATPase activity, supporting the notion that kinectin is the kinesin receptor on organelles not only to anchor kinesin but also to release kinesin from the inactive compact conformation. These and other studies lead us to a better understanding of the kinectin function in organelle motility. The restriction enzymes used were from Promega (Madison, WI), and all of the other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The human kinectin gene (GenBankTM accession number Z22551) was a generous gift from Dr. Martin Krönke (Christian-Albrechts University of Kiel, Germany). The kinectin bait A (residues 46–444) and bait C (residues 987–1356) were generated by amplifying their respective region using standard polymerase chain reaction protocol (37Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 14.2-14.4Google Scholar), and their sequences were verified by sequencing. Bait B (residues 444–1049) was obtained directly by digesting the human kinectin gene with PstI. The three cDNA fragments were directionally subcloned in frame to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (BD) of the pAS2–1 vector (CLONTECH). The details of the kinectin bait constructs are illustrated in Fig. 1. A yeast two-hybrid system (CLONTECH) was used according to the supplied protocol. The kinectin baits were used to screen a human adult brain Matchmaker cDNA library fused to the GAL4 DNA-activation domain (AD) of the pACT2 vector (CLONTECH). The baits and the amplified library were sequentially transformed into yeast strain Y190 (CLONTECH) using the lithium acetate method (38Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transformants were assayed for their expression ofhis reporter gene by plating them onto the synthetic medium deficient in tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. 25 mm of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was included to limit the number of false his positives (39Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.L. Yeh S.H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Colonies that grew successfully in the selective medium were further screened for their expression of the lacZ reporter gene by colony lift assay. The cDNAs in the AD vector of the persistent positive clones were isolated. False positives were further eliminated via testing whether the clones were able to activate both reporter genes with the control bait (BD vector alone). The primary sequences of the positive clones were determined with an ABI PRISM Big DyeTM Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Kit using an ABI PRISMTM 377 DNA sequencer, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The results were analyzed with the LASERGENE (DNASTAR) and the BLAST 2.0 (National Library of Medicine) software. GlutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion constructs with the kinectin baits A, B, and C were made by subcloning the corresponding cDNA into the expression vector pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Thehis tag fusion construct of the neuronal kinesin heavy chain (nKHC) was also made by subcloning the nKHC cDNA into an expression vector pRSET (Invitrogen). The fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21/pLysS (DE3) (generous gift from Niovi Santama, University of Cyprus and Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics). Protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. Intact bacterial cells containing the expressed fusion proteins were collected by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min. Protein extracts were obtained by freezing and thawing the cell pellet and resuspended in GST purification buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 mmMgCl2, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) plus 5 mm dithiothreitol. Equal amounts of the GST fusion proteins with baits A, B, and C were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads by end-over-end mixing in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with GST purification buffer to remove unbound proteins. The expressed his-nKHC fusion protein extract was allowed to interact with the GST-bait fusion protein-coated beads for 2 h at 4 °C with end-over-end mixing. Any unbound proteins were removed through extensive washings. The proteins that remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits were released by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (12%) electrophoresis (PAGE), and immunoblotting with mouse RGS-his antibody (Qiagen). Antibody binding was detected with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), coupled to alkaline phosphatase according to the manufacturer's specifications. Kinectin baits, A, B, and C, were coupled onto glutathione-agarose as described above. Mouse brain cytosolic fractions were prepared as follows. The brain tissues were rinsed once in PBS and frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. The frozen tissues were thawed quickly in one volume of prewarmed PMEE′ buffer (35 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgSO4, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm EDTA) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml p-tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 10 μg/ml tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm dithiothreitol. After complete thawing, the tissue was homogenized with 10 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer, incubated for 15 min on ice, and homogenized with 10 more strokes. This was repeated twice. The homogenate was centrifuged at 16,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (S1) was collected and centrifuged again in a Beckman SW55.1 rotor for 30 min at 35,000 rpm and 4 °C. The resulting supernatant (S2) was adjusted to 1 mm GTP and 20 μm taxol and incubated for 15 min at 37 °C to polymerize the endogenous microtubules. The assembled microtubules were removed by centrifugation for 15 min at 35,000 rpm and 22 °C. The final supernatant (S3 cytosol) was then used as the source of the cytosolic motor kinesin. S3 cytosol was added to the GST-bait fusion protein coated beads and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. Unbound proteins were removed through extensive washings. The proteins that remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits were released by boiling in SDS gel sample buffer, analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting with SUK-4 anti-kinesin heavy chain monoclonal antibody (40Scholey J.M. Heuser J. Yang J.T. Goldstein L.S. Nature. 1989; 338: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Bio-Rad), coupled to alkaline phosphatase according to the manufacturer's specifications. A series of truncated fragments of the nKHC (N1 to N13) were constructed (Fig.4) by performing polymerase chain reaction. The amplified fragments were subcloned into the AD vector, and their interaction with the kinectin bait C was assayed using the yeast two-hybrid system as described above. A total of 50 yeast transformants were picked from each truncated clone to assay for the activation of the hisand lacZ reporter genes. Clones were considered as positive only when more than 90% of the transformants activated both reporter genes. Ubiquitous kinesin heavy chain (uKHC) (GenBankTM accession number X65873) was provided by Dr. Ronald Vale (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, UCSF). uKHC bait was constructed by amplifying a region between residues 602 and 963 using polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the BD vector. A series of truncated fragments of the kinectin were constructed (Fig. 1), and their interaction with the uKHC was assayed using the yeast two-hybrid system as described above. Bovine brain tubulin and kinesin were purified as described previously (41Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. Methods in Molecular Biology. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ2000Google Scholar). Microtubule-activated ATPase activity of kinesin in the presence of truncated kinectin fragments at the final concentrations of 0.1 or 0.2 mg/ml was measured at 37 °C as described previously (42Kuznetsov S.A. Vaisberg Y.A. Rothwell S.W. Murphy D.B. Gelfand V.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 589-595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Kuznetsov S.A. Gelfand V.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8530-8534Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of taxol-stabilized microtubules, kinesin, and kinectin fragments in ATPase assay were 1.0 mg/ml, 15 μg/ml and 0.1 or 0.2 mg/ml, respectively. The kinesin-binding domain on kinectin (KNT+, residues 1188–1288) and a larger fragment containing the domain (K1, residues 987–1356) were subcloned into the pEGFP-C vector for optimal expression in mammalian cells (CLONTECH). KNT− (residues 1049–1146) that showed no interaction with the uKHC bait in yeast two-hybrid screening2 and the pEGFP-C vector alone were used as controls. In addition, the kinectin-binding domain on uKHC (uKHC+, residues 833–900) that interacts with kinectin and a control domain that does not bind kinectin (uKHC−, residues 735–801) were also cloned into the pEGFP-C vector. COS7 cells were cultured and transfected as described above. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression. Lysosome-specific staining was obtained by incubating cells with 50 nm LysoTracker DND-99 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) in normal Ringer's solution for 30 min. Lysosome redistribution upon acidification as described previously (44Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) was assayed. Cells were subsequently fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem), and imaged using a Carl Zeiss LSM410 laser-scanning confocal microscope. A total of 90 cells were observed for each clone for their lysosome redistribution. The results were tabulated based on the mean percentage of cells in each of the four categories, namely clustered around cell center, clustered centrally with radiating tubules, dispersed throughout cell, or dispersed with peripheral organelle clusters (44Heuser J. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 855-864Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 45Nakata T. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1039-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We performed a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for proteins that interact with kinectin. Three overlapping kinectin fragments, A, B, and C, were constructed as baits (Fig. 1). Most of the positive clones identified were those that interact with the kinectin bait C. A total of 14 positive clones were identified from the screening of approximately 1.8 × 106 transformants. Among them, two were nKHC cDNAs (GenBankTM accession number U06698). The two clones (2.5 and 1.1 kilobases) code for two nKHC fragments with residues 284–1032 and 601–957, respectively. Both nKHC fragments interacted with the kinectin bait C but not with the control baits (A or B or BD vector alone). Bait C encodes the kinectin fragment (residues 987–1356) that does not contain the predicted leucine zipper motifs (residues 934–962) in the core of a predicted α-helical coiled-coil. The leucine zipper motifs reside in the control bait B. Thus, our observed nKHC-bait C interaction is unlikely to be due to nonspecific interaction between the coiled coils. To corroborate the yeast two-hybrid data, we performed an in vitro binding study. GST fusion constructs with the kinectin baits A, B, and C were made, and equal amounts of the individual fusion-protein extracts were immobilized onto glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were washed extensively to remove unbound proteins such that only the kinectin baits remained bound to the beads (Fig.2 A). An nKHC fusion construct with a his tag was expressed in E. coli, and the cell extract was allowed to interact with the immobilized GST-bait fusion proteins. The proteins remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits after extensive washings were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-his antibody (Fig.2 B). Association of the nKHC in vitro with the kinectin bait C, but not with bait A nor B, is consistent with the interactions observed in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The in vitro binding study was also extended to cytosolic kinesin for further assessment of the kinectin-kinesin interaction. Mouse brain cytosol was extracted and incubated with the immobilized GST-bait (kinectin) fusion proteins. The cytosolic proteins remained bound to the immobilized GST-baits after extensive washings were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-kinesin antibody (Fig.3). The association of cytosolic kinesin with the kinectin bait C, but not with bait A nor B, supports the observation of specific kinectin-kinesin interaction. Further in anin vivo co-immunoprecipitation experiment, we tagged nKHC with a FLAG tag and co-transfected the FLAG-tagged nKHC with a GST-tagged kinectin bait C into COS7 cells. Immunoprecipitates of the co-transfected COS7 cell extracts via the GST-tagged kinectin bait C on a glutathione-agarose column were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FLAG and anti-human kinectin antibodies. The FLAG-nKHC co-precipitates with the GST-bait C.2 To identify the minimally sufficient domain of nKHC that interacts with kinectin, we have constructed a series of truncated fragments of nKHC (Fig. 4) and assayed for their interaction with the kinectin bait C using the yeast two-hybrid assay. Clones N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N9, N10, and N11 could interact with bait C as indicated by the activation of thehis and lacZ reporter genes, whereas N7, N8, N12, and N13 could not. A minimally sufficient kinectin-binding domain on nKHC, clone nKHC+ that encodes a 54-amino acid fragment (residues 836–890), was deduced from these results, and its interaction with the kinectin bait C was experimentally confirmed using the yeast two-hybrid assay. From our yeast two-hybrid screening for kinectin-binding proteins, we have identified another member of the human conventional kinesin heavy chains (KIAA0531) as a kinectin-binding protein. KIAA0531 (GenBankTM accession number AB011103) was reported as one of the 100 large human proteins whose genes were sequenced. KIAA0531 shares 76% of sequence homology with the human uKHC. The mouse homolog of KIAA0531 is KIF5C, whereas the mouse homologs of the other two members of the human conventional kinesin heavy chains (nKHC and uKHC) are KIF5A and KIF5B, respectively (46Xia C. Rahman A. Yang Z. Goldstein L.S. Genomics. 1998; 52: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Therefore, KIAA0531 has also been called the human KIF5C, which means the third member of the human conventional kinesin heavy chains. The kinectin-binding domain on KIAA0531 was characterized, experimentally tested for its interaction with the kinectin baits (Fig.2), and fine mapped (residues 828–897) as described above for nKHC. The protein sequences of the kinectin-binding domains on nKHC (nKHC+) and KIAA0531 were aligned, and they share 93% sequence homology. The kinectin-binding domain of the uKHC was also characterized, tested experimentally for its interaction with the kinectin baits, and fine mapped (residues 833–900) as described above for nKHC. Indeed, this region of the uKHC that shares 91% sequence homology with nKHC and 98% with KIAA0531 also interacts with the kinectin bait C (Fig. 2). Therefore, the same highly conserved domains of all three members of the human conventional kinesin heavy chains interact with kinectin. Kinectin is an elongated molecule with multiple domains (47Yu H. Nicchitta C.V. Kumar J. Becker M. Toyoshima I. Sheetz M.P. Mol. Biol.

Erickson H.P. Sheetz M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31738-31743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). There are up to six variable domains in the middle to tail (COOH terminus) of kinectin (49Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 421-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Multiple modification (glycosylation, myristoylation, and phosphorylation) sites in or near these domains were postulated (48Futterer A. Kruppa G. Kramer B. Lemke H. Kronke M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 161-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar,49Leung E. Print C.G. Parry D.A. Closey D.N. Lockhart P.J. Skinner S.J. Batchelor D.C. Krissansen G.W. Immunol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5600-5605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To understand whether and how these modifications modulate kinesin binding to kinectin and involvement in organelle motility, it is important to characterize the kinesin-binding domain on kinectin. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we have established above that uKHC interacts with the kinectin bait C (residues 987–1356). To identify the minimally sufficient domain of kinectin that interacts with uKHC, we have constructed a series of truncated kinectin fragments (Fig. 1) and assayed for their interaction with an uKHC-bait (residues 602–963) that contains the kinectin-binding domain (residues 833–900). Among the 14 clones, 10 were positive as indicated by the activation of thehis and lacZ reporter genes in the yeast two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1 A). Clones K1, K5, K6, K7, K8, K9, K12, K13, and K14 could interact with the uKHC-bait, whereas K2, K3, K4, K10, and K11 could not. The minimally sufficient kinesin-binding domain KNT+ (residues 1188–1288) on kinectin was deduced from these results, and its interaction with the uKHC-bait was confirmed experimentally with the yeast two-hybrid assay. Since the COOH terminus of kinectin can bind to the kinesin tail where the head and tail of kinesin interact with each other to maintain the inactive compact conformation, we hypothesize that kinectin is the postulated cargo receptor for kinesin activation, so we tested whether the kinesin-binding domain on kinectin can activate the microtubule-stimulated kinesin-ATPase activity. When purified KNT+ (kinesin-binding domain, residues 1188–1288) and KNT− (negative control, residues 1049–1146) were added to an assay measuring the microtubule-stimulated kinesin-ATPase activity, KNT+ significantly (74 ± 10%) enhanced the kinesin-ATPase activities whereas KNT− did not (Fig.5).

The vasoactive peptides vasopressin, angiotensin II, and endothelin inhibit natriuretic peptide-dependent cGMP elevations by activating protein kinase C (PKC). Recently, we identified sixin vivo phosphorylation sites for NPR-A and five sites for NPR-B and demonstrated that the phosphorylation of these sites is required for ligand-dependent receptor activation. Here, we show that phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, a direct activator of PKC, causes the dephosphorylation and desensitization of NPR-B. In contrast to the CNP-dependent desensitization process, which results in coordinate dephosphorylation of all five sites in the receptor, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate treatment causes the dephosphorylation of only one site, which we have identified as Ser523. The conversion of this residue to alanine or glutamate did not reduce the amount of mature receptor protein as indicated by detergent-dependent guanylyl cyclase activities or Western blot analysis but completely blocked the ability of PKC to induce the dephosphorylation and desensitization of NPR-B. Thus, in contrast to previous reports suggesting that PKC directly phosphorylates and inhibits guanylyl cyclase-linked natriuretic peptide receptors, we show that PKC-dependent dephosphorylation of NPR-B at Ser523 provides a possible molecular explanation for how pressor hormones inhibit CNP signaling.

Cell Biol. 1998; 110: 335-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). ANP and BNP activate the natriuretic peptide receptor-A (NPR-A, also known as guanylyl cyclase A (GC-A)), and CNP activates the natriuretic peptide receptor B (NPR-B, also known as guanylyl cyclase B (GC-B)) (3Koller K.J.

Shirakami G. Arai H. Saito Y. Kambayashi Y. Inouye K. Imura H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 229-239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Once in the circulation, ANP and BNP migrate to their target tissues such as the kidney, adrenal gland, and the peripheral vasculature. Natriuretic peptide binding to NPR-A present in these tissues stimulates the elevation of intracellular cGMP concentrations, which result in renal sodium and water excretion, decreased aldosterone secretion, and vascular smooth muscle relaxation (5Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar, 6Drewett J.G. Garbers D.L. Endocr.

The combined effect of these processes is decreased blood pressure. Recent studies have begun to paint a broader picture of cardiac natriuretic peptide function because ANP has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation in culture (8Appel R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: F911-F918PubMed Google Scholar), and male NPR-A “knockout” mice die before 6 months of age because of apparent cardiac hypertrophy (9Oliver P.M. Fox J.E. Kim R. Rockman H.A. Kim H.S. Reddick R.L. Pandey K.N. Milgram S.L. Smithies O. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14730-14735Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Whether the hypertrophy is a direct effect of the loss of the antiproliferative actions of NPR-A, an indirect result of the increased cardiac load in these animals, or both is not known. The biological role of CNP is less apparent. Although CNP was first isolated from porcine brain, it is now known to be present in extraneural tissues, including uterus, trachea, seminal plasma, endothelial cells, and chondrocytes (10Suga S.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10729-10733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological function of CNP in many of these tissues is not known, but recent data are providing clues as to its function in blood vessels and bone. With respect to the former, it has been proposed that CNP and NPR-B comprise a vascular natriuretic peptide paracrine system with ligand and receptor being expressed in endothelial and smooth muscle cells, respectively (14Itoh H. Suga S. Ogawa Y. Komatsu Y. Tamura N. Igaki T. Yamashita J. Ikeda T. Doi K. Chun T.H. Inoue M. Matsuda K. Yoshimasa T. Ueda M. Ban T. Nakao K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1997; 811: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis, endothelial cells, which are directly exposed to blood, can respond to circulating cytokines such as transforming growth factor-β and tumor necrosis factor-α by dramatically increasing the synthesis of CNP. The endothelially produced CNP can then communicate in a paracrine manner with the adjacent smooth muscle cells by stimulating NPR-B to exert its vasorelaxant and growth inhibitory actions. This pathway may be an ideal pharmacologic target because CNP has been shown to inhibit intimal thickening in response to certain types of vascular injury, such as coronary angioplasty (15Shinomiya M. Tashiro J. Saito Y. Yoshida S. Furuya M. Oka N. Tanaka S. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 1051-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 16Furuya M. Miyazaki T. Honbou N. Kawashima K. Ohno T. Tanaka S. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 748: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Another exciting role for CNP is as a regulator of long bone growth. Studies using chondrocytes, osteoclast-containing bone marrow cultures, or osteoblasts have shown that natriuretic peptides can regulate the proliferation and differentiation of these cells (13Hagiwara H.

Physiol. 1996; 270: C1311-C1318Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transgenic overexpression of BNP results in skeletal overgrowth in mice (19Suda M. Ogawa Y. Tanaka K. Tamura N. Yasoda A. Takigawa T. Uehira M. Nishimoto H. Itoh H. Saito Y. Shiota K. Nakao K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2337-2342Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), and CNP but not ANP increases the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones in cultured fetal mouse tibias (20Yasoda A. Ogawa Y. Suda M. Tamura N. Mori K. Sakuma Y. Chusho H. Shiota K. Tanaka K. Nakao K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Consistent with these findings are the observations that mice lacking NPR-C also display skeletal overgrowth (21Matsukawa N. Grzesik W.J. Takahashi N. Pandey K.N. Pang S. Yamauchi M. Smithies O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7403-7408Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar), and mice lacking type II cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which is one step downstream in the CNP signal transduction pathway, exhibit dwarfism (22Pfeifer A. Aszodi A. Seidler U. Ruth P. Hofmann F. Fassler R. Science. 1996; 274: 2082-2086Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Based on these recent data, it is now clear that the CNP/NPR-B system plays an important regulatory role in bone as well as brain and vascular tissue. Studies on the regulation of NPR-A and -B have revealed both similarities and differences with other cell surface receptor systems. The basic topology of NPR-A and -B is similar to many growth factor receptors. It consists of an extracellular ligand binding domain, a single membrane spanning domain, a region with significant similarity to known protein kinases called the kinase homology domain (KHD), and a carboxyl-terminal guanylyl cyclase catalytic domain (23Garbers D.L. Methods. 1999; 19: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Unlike most growth factor receptors, NPR-A exists as a higher order homomeric structure in the absence of ligand, and ANP binding does not lead to further aggregation (24Iwata T. Uchida-Mizuno K. Katafuchi T. Ito T. Hagiwara H. Hirose S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo ). 1991; 110: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 25Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol.

NPR-B is also an oligomer in the absence of ligand (27Kitano K. Fukuda Y. Nagahira K. Nasu T. Noguchi C. Izumi R. Kawashima K. Nakanishi T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 194: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and it has been shown to heterodimerize with NPR-A when both receptors are overexpressed in cultured cells (25Chinkers M. Wilson E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18589-18597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to natriuretic peptides, ATP also is required for the activation of NPR-A and -B (28Kurose H. Inagami T. Ui M. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Chang C.H. Kohse K.P. Chang B. Hirata M. Jiang B. Douglas J.E. Murad F. Biochim. Biophys.

Sharma R.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 209: 286-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The effect of ATP has been suggested to be mediated allosterically by the KHD, because nonhydrolyzable adenine nucleotide analogs can substitute for ATP, and deletion mutants lacking the KHD are constitutively active and are not further stimulated by hormone (32Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Science. 1989; 245: 1392-1394Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, recent data indicate that ATP also is required to keep the KHD phosphorylated (see below). Both NPR-A and -B are constitutively phosphorylated when expressed in tissue culture cells (33Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Koller K.J. Lipari M.T. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and receptor phosphorylation is essential for hormonal activation (37Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 38Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). NPR-A contains four serine and two threonine phosphorylation sites (Ser497, Thr500, Ser502, Ser506, Ser510, and Thr513) located within the KHD, and NPR-B contains at least five sites (Ser513, Thr516, Ser518, Ser523, and Ser526) located in similar positions (37Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 38Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The coordinated dephosphorylation of these sites in response to hormone binding has been shown to correlate with the desensitization of these receptors in whole cells (33Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), and the serine/threonine phosphatase inhibitors microcystin and okadaic acid have been shown to increase both the phosphorylation state and the ANP-dependent activity of NPR-A in crude membrane preparations (39Foster D.C. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16311-16318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The receptor itself is the target of the phosphatase present in these membrane preparations because a mutant form of NPR-A that cannot be dephosphorylated is resistant to the effects of microcystin and desensitizes more slowly than the wild type receptor (56Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1811-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The pressor hormones arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and endothelin, which activate PKC through the stimulation of phospholipase C-β oppose the actions of natriuretic peptides (40Richards A.M. Heart. 1996; 76: 36-44Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, pressor peptides cause increases in renal sodium and water retention, vasoconstriction, and cell proliferation, whereas natriuretic peptides cause renal excretion of sodium and water and vasorelaxation and inhibit cell proliferation. Furthermore, all three pressor peptides as well as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (41McArdle C.A. Poch A. Kappler K.

J. 1997; 324: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), have been put forth as molecular explanations for the PKC-dependent desensitization of NPR-A and -B, conclusive experimental tests of these hypotheses have not been forthcoming. Here, we show that PMA stimulates the dephosphorylation of NPR-B at Ser523 and that the mutation of this single residue is sufficient to block both the PMA-dependent dephosphorylation and desensitization of this receptor. The wild type and many of the mutant NPR-B expression constructs have been previously described (38Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The glutamate mutations (S523E, S526E, and 5E (S513E, T516E, S518E, S523E, S526E)) were generated on the 304-base pair EcoRV-XbaI fragment of NPR-B, which was subcloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene, San Diego, CA). The mutations were generated using the Quikchange kit from Stratagene according to the manufacturer's protocols. The mutantEcoRV-XbaI fragments were then subcloned back into the corresponding region of the expression plasmid pRK5-NPR-B (38Potter L.R. Hunter T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15533-15539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). All indicated mutations and the absence of unwanted mutations were confirmed by automated nucleic acid sequencing. HEK 293 cells were grown to ∼50% confluence in 10-cm dishes and then transfected by adding 1 ml of a mixture containing 5 μg of the various pRK5-NPR-B constructs, 0.125 m CaCl2, and 25 mm BES-buffered saline, pH 6.96–7.00. The cells were incubated overnight in a 3% CO2 incubator, and the next day the medium was changed. 24–48 h after the transfection mixture was added to the cells they were either metabolically labeled or harvested for membrane preparation. 24 h after transfections, cells were split into 12-well dishes and incubated overnight. The next day these cells were 50–75% confluent and were washed once with 1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM). They were then incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM containing 0.5 mm1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor used to block cGMP degradation) and either 200 nm or no PMA for 30 min. The plates were then moved to a bench top at ambient temperature, and 55 μl of 1 μm CNP was added to each well (final concentration, 100 nm). The cells were incubated for 10 min, and then 0.5 ml 6% trichloroacetic acid was added to each plate to terminate the production of cGMP. The amount of cGMP contained in each well (cells and medium) was determined using a cGMP radioimmunoassay kit from DuPont according to the manufacturer's protocol. 10-cm plates of transfected HEK 293 cells were washed once with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped off the plate in 0.5 ml of phosphatase inhibitor buffer (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 0.1m NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 80 μm β-glycerol phosphate, and 0.1 μmokadaic acid or microcystin), sonicated with a Branson Sonifier Cell Disrupter at 4 °C and centrifuged at 15,800 × g for 20 min at 2 °C. The resulting membrane pellet was resuspended in HGPB (50 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 50 mmNaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) at a protein concentration of 1.0–2.5 mg/ml as estimated by the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). A detailed description of the phosphopeptide mapping procedure used in this study has recently been published (53Potter L.R. Hunter T. Methods. 1999; 19: 506-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected HEK 293 cells were washed twice with phosphate-deficient DMEM and then changed to 95% phosphate-deficient DMEM, 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B, and 1 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) and incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C overnight. NPR-B was isolated from metabolically labeled cells by immunoprecipitation with rabbit polyclonal antiserum Z658 (kindly provided by David L. Garbers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane as described under “Immunoblot Analysis.” Labeled NPR-B adsorbed to Immobilon-P membrane was localized by autoradiography, and the band corresponding to NPR-B was then cut out and incubated with 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone dissolved in 0.1 m acetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C. The membrane was then washed, and 200 μl of a solution containing 50 mm (NH4)2CO3, 5% acetonitrile, and 10 μg of tosylphenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin was added to each sample and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The remaining buffer was removed by repeated lyophilization using a SpeedVac rotary evaporator. The phosphopeptides were dissolved in a small volume of distilled water and spotted on 100-μm-thick cellulose plates (Merck). The phosphopeptides were first separated in the horizontal dimension by high voltage electrophoresis (1000 V) for 25 min in 1% ammonium carbonate, pH 8.9, and then by ascending chromatography in phosphochromatography buffer. The phosphopeptides were visualized by exposing the plates to Kodak XAR film for approximately 1 week at −80 °C with one intensifying screen. A phosphopeptide with the sequence GSS(P)Y was synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer and purified according to the manufacturer's protocol. The mass composition of the phosphopeptide was verified by laser desorption mass spectroscopy. Phosphopeptide C was scraped from the plates and eluted from the free cellulose by vortexing in 200 μl of water followed by spinning the mixture through an ultrafree-MC Millipore 0.22 micron filter unit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a microcentrifuge for 30 s. This extraction was repeated for a total of three times. The purified phosphopeptide was then dried down in a SpeedVac, resuspended in 50 μl of (NH4)2CO3, pH 8, and digested with 2 μg of purified chymotrypsin at 37 °C for 2 h. The digestion products were dried down, resuspended in 10 μl of water, spotted on a cellulose plate, and electrophoretically fractionated in the presence or absence of 5 μg of the synthetic peptide GSS(P)Y at pH 8.9 for 25 min at 1 kV. The radioactive phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography, and the synthetic peptide was visualized by staining with 0.25% ninhydrin in acetone. NPR-B was isolated as described above and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride (Immobilon-P) membrane. The membrane was then blocked for 1 h in TBST (20 mm Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane, 500 mmNaCl, and 0.05% polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, pH 7.5) containing 3% bovine serum albumin, washed three times for 5 min with TBST, and then incubated with rabbit antiserum R1215 (kindly provided by David L. Garbers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) diluted 1:500 in TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at 25 °C. This antiserum was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the last 15 amino acids of NPR-A (33Potter L.R. Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14531-14534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but cross-reacts with NPR-B on an immunoblot. The membrane was washed three times for 10 min with TBST and incubated for 45 min at 25 °C with protein A conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was then washed once for 15 min and twice for 5 min in TBST. The NPR-B antibody complex was detected by chemiluminescence using the ECL Western blot Detection System from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. All guanylyl cyclase assays were at 37 °C in the presence of 25 mm PIPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm 1-methyl-3-isobutylxanthine, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm creatine phosphate and 5–10 units/assay creatine phosphokinase (as a nucleotide regenerating system), 1 mm GTP and 0.1–0.2 μCi of [α-32P]GTP. 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP, and 1 μm CNP or 1% Triton X-100 and 3 mm MnCl2 were also included in the reaction mixtures. Assays were initiated by the addition of a solution of the above reagents to approximately 50 μg of crude membrane protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. Assays were terminated by addition of 0.5 ml of 110 mm zinc acetate. [32P]cGMP was purified as follows: 0.5 ml of 110 mm sodium carbonate was added to precipitate the [32P]GTP. The reactions tubes were vortexed, incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 2000 ×g for 10 min. at 4 °C. The supernatant was added to chromatography columns (Bio-Rad model-731–1550) containing 0.5 g of (dry) neutral alumina resin (Sigma-A9003) that had been acidified with 5 ml of 1 n perchloric acid. The columns were then washed sequentially with 10 ml of 1 n perchloric acid, and 10 ml of water, and then the 32P-cGMP was eluted into scintillation vials with 5 ml of freshly prepared 200 mmammonium formate. [32P]cGMP recovered was quantitated by the method of Cerenkov in a Beckman 3801 scintillation counter. To investigate whether PKC has a direct effect on NPR-B, we first identified a transient expression cell culture system that mimics the effect that PMA has on NPR-B in untransfected cells. For this purpose, we chose HEK 293 cells because they are highly transfectable and do not express detectable levels of endogenous NPR-B, although they do express low levels of NPR-A (37Potter L.R. Hunter T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2164-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The basal cGMP concentrations of cells transiently transfected with NPR-B were low (10 pmol/well), and a 30-min incubation with 200 nm PMA reduced their concentration by 50% to 5 pmol/well (Fig.1). A 5-min stimulation with 100 nm CNP elevated the cGMP concentrations in resting cells more than 25-fold to 254 pmol/well. However, a 30-min preincubation with 200 nm PMA reduced the CNP-dependent cGMP levels in these cells to less than 10% of the control values. Because these data are qualitatively similar to those reported for PMA effects on CNP responses in primary astrocytes (54Yeung V.T. Ho S.K. Cockram C.S. Lee C.M. Nicholls M.G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 308: 301-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), pituitary tumor cells (41McArdle C.A. Poch A. Kappler K. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 2065-2072Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar,55Fowkes R.C. Forrest-Owen W. McArdle C.A. J. Endocrinol. 2000; 166: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and ciliary epithelial cells (51Crook R.B. Chang A.T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we concluded that the HEK 293 cells were an appropriate model for further studies. Because PMA treatment reduced basal cGMP concentrations, it was possible that PKC was decreasing CNP-dependent cGMP elevations by stimulating a isobutylxanthine-resistant phosphodiesterase. Therefore, we tested whether or not the diminished cGMP response was attributable to a direct effect on NPR-B catalytic activity. To this end, transfected HEK 293 cells were treated as described above except that after the 30-min PMA incubation, crude membranes were prepared and assayed for guanylyl cyclase activities in the presence either of CNP, ATP, and Mg2+ or Triton X-100 and Mn2+. The former conditions estimate the physiological activity of the receptor, whereas the latter conditions are known to maximally activate NPR-B in a hormone independent manner (36Potter L.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2422-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Hence, activity determined in the presence of Triton X-100 and Mn2+ is an excellent indicator of the total amount of NPR-B present in any given membrane preparation. We used this measurement as an internal control for the amount of activity loss attributable to receptor degradation. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the CNP-dependent activi"

We show that TRP-1 folding process occurs much more rapidly than for tyrosinase, a highly homologous protein, being completed post-translationally by the formation of critical disulfide bonds. In cells pretreated with dithiothreitol (DTT), unfolded TRP-1 is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum by a prolonged interaction with calnexin and BiP before being targeted for degradation. The TRP-1 chain was able to fold into DTT-resistant conformations both in the presence or absence of α-glucosidase inhibitors, but folding occurred through different pathways. During the normal folding pathway, TRP-1 interacts with calnexin. In the presence of α-glucosidase inhibitors, the interaction with calnexin is prevented, with TRP-1 folding being assisted by BiP. In this case, the process has similar kinetics to that of untreated TRP-1 and yields a compact form insensitive to DTT as well. However, this form has different thermal denaturation properties than the native conformation. We conclude that disulfide bridge burring is crucial for the TRP-1 export. This suggests that although various folding pathways may complete this process, the native form may be acquired only through the normal unperturbed pathway.

Unlike mutations at albino locus on chromosome 7 that encodes the tyrosinase, mutations at brown locus do not eliminate pigmentation but result in synthesis of brown instead of black eumelanin (9Zdarsky E.

TRP-1 is a type I membrane glycoprotein with 533 amino acids, 6 potential N-glycosylation sites, 17 cysteine residues grouped in two cysteine-rich domains, and two copper binding domains (1Hearing V.J.

TRP-1 and tyrosinase share a significant level of homology in several regions including the cysteine-rich domains and the potential N-glycosylation sites (1Hearing V.J. King R.A. Levine N.

J. 1999; 344: 659-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) follows the regular biosynthesis pathway as most of the membrane glycoproteins. After synthesis in the ER compartment, the partiallyN-glycosylated polypeptide transits the Golgi compartment, and it is finally transported to its target organelle, the melanosome. The nascent polypeptide of a membrane glycoprotein is translocated into the ER compartment and folds into the native conformation assisted by molecular chaperones and other ER-resident molecules. The polypeptide compaction is associated for most of them with the formation of disulfide bonds (oxidative folding) that stabilize the native conformation. The reversible formation of disulfides is facilitated by the oxidizing environment of the ER lumen and is catalyzed by specific enzymes (15Freedman R.B. Cell. 1989; 57: 1069-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar, 16Freedman R.B. Hirst T.R. Tuite M.F. Trends Biochem.

In order to assess the role of disulfide formation on polypeptide intracellular transport, sorting, and processing, the ER redox potential can be manipulated by culturing the cells in the presence of reducing agents (18Alberini C.M.

N-Glycan processing has been shown to be an important event involved in the folding of the nascent chain.N-Glycosylation sites are occupied in the ER compartment by the co-translational attachment of the core glycan, Glc3Man9GlcNAc2. The trimming of Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 precursor by ER glucosidases I and II initiates the N-glycan processing and interferes with the folding events. The resulting monoglucosylated form, GlcMan9GlcNAc2, becomes substrate for the lectin chaperones calnexin and calreticulin that assist the polypeptide until the native conformation is achieved (23Trombetta E.S. Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 587-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In the presence of α-glucosidase I inhibitors, such as deoxynojirimicin,N-butyl-deoxynojirimicin (NB-DNJ), and castanospermine, the trimming of the first glucose is abolished. Thus, the glucosylatedN-glycans cannot be further processed, and glycoprotein folding cannot be controlled by the calnexin cycle. Calnexin and calreticulin have been shown to direct the bound polypeptide chain into deglucosylation/reglucosylation cycles in which the lectins act in conjunction with glucosyltransferase and α-glucosidase II to retain the nascent chain in repeated binding and release cycles until complete folding (24Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The components of the calnexin cycle are elements of the ER quality control system, which eliminates the grossly misfolded proteins and allows the export of the correctly folded ones. It has been reported that another component of the quality control is the chaperone BiP, the immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein. BiP is a molecular chaperone that transiently interacts with unfolded stretches of a nascent polypeptide as long as these regions have not reached their folded conformation (25Leitzgen K. Haas I.G. Chemtracts-Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 11: 423-445Google Scholar). Some proteins remain bound to BiP until they are degraded, and a role for BiP as a lid of the translocon pore has been recently suggested (26Skowronek N.H. Hendershot L.M. Haas I.G. Cell. 1998; 92: 747-758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Although sequential interactions of the chain with the two chaperones and complexes between calnexin and BiP have been reported, it is still unclear if BiP and calnexin are required for the correct folding of any individual glycoprotein (27Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 2000; 288: 331-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that inhibition of early N-glycan processing with NB-DNJ resulted in tyrosinase inactivation and a dramatic loss of cell pigmentation in melanoma cells (28Petrescu S.M.

It has been also shown that the inhibitory effect of NB-DNJ affected dramatically the folding pathway of the nascent chain. This proved to be strictly controlled by the interaction with calnexin (29Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Our more recent studies demonstrated that under the same inhibitory conditions in the same cell line, the TRP-1 polypeptide chain was able to overcome the glucosidase blockade by the action of the Golgi endomannosidase, which allowed the further processing of the N-glycans to complex structures (32Negroiu G.

These findings prompted us to hypothesize that in the presence of the ER glucosidase inhibitors TRP-1 chain could fold by alternative pathways to a different conformation that could also influence the further processing of its N-glycans (for a review see Ref. 33Petrescu S.M. Branza-Nichita N. Negroiu G. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5229-5237Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this paper, we investigated the folding pathway of TRP-1 synthesized in mouse melanoma cells. We demonstrate that disulfide bonds post-translationally formed are essential for TRP-1 maturation and stability. The nascent chain is retained in the ER until the attainment of a conformation with a disulfide bond pattern conferring DTT resistance. During folding, TRP-1 interacts with calnexin, and this interaction is prolonged when the S—S bonds are prevented from forming. The inhibition of N-glycan processing in the ER perturbs but does not completely prevent TRP-1 folding and maturation and does not affect its stability. In NB-DNJ-treated cells TRP-1 polypeptide, which does not bind to calnexin but binds to BiP, acquires a conformation stabilized also by disulfides.

B16 F1 mouse melanoma cells (European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, Porton Down, UK) were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of air/CO2 (19:1). B16 mouse melanoma cells were harvested with EDTA washed three times with 0.1 mphosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, and resuspended in methionine- and cysteine-free RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (107 cells/ml) were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C before the addition of [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine at 200 μCi/ml. Following the labeling period of 10 min, RPMI medium containing 5 mm unlabeled methionine was added. 5 mm DTT was added to the cells 5 min before the pulse and maintained at the same concentration during the chase periods. In NB-DNJ experiments cells were cultured before labeling for 2 h in normal medium containing 5 mm NB-DNJ, and the inhibitor was further maintained at the same concentration during the chase periods. At the indicated times, the chase media were removed, and the cells were harvested by scrapping into ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. Samples analyzed for the S—S bond formation were incubated before lysis for 1 h at 4 °C with 20 mm NEM to block the free SH groups and to prevent the nonspecific formation of S—S bonds. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 200 mm NaCl, and proteinase inhibitors), for 1 h on ice. When samples were to be used for immunoprecipitation of BiP, cells were lysed in the presence of 20 units/ml apyrase (to enzymatically deplete ATP). 35S-Labeled cell lysates were precleared with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C and incubated with αPEP1, anti-calnexin, or anti-BiP antisera for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplexes were separated by incubation with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The slurry was washed with 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 0.5% CHAPS and 200 mm NaCl. TRP-1 was further eluted in 1% SDS for 1 h at room temperature divided in three and (a) mixed before running with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions), (b) incubated for 5 min at 100 °C and mixed with SDS-PAGE sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol (denaturing and non-reducing conditions), (c) incubated in SDS-PAGE sample buffer with β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C (denaturing and reducing conditions). When TRP-1 bound to calnexin or BiP was analyzed, samples were eluted for 1 h at room temperature in lysis buffer containing 1% SDS. SDS concentration was decreased in eluates at 0.1%, and TRP-1 was immunoprecipitated with αPEP1. Unless other specifications were made, samples were run in SDS-7.5% PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. 35S-Labeled samples were digested with Endo H or PNGaseF as described (14Negroiu G. Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 659-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, TRP-1 samples were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose in Endo H or PNGaseF denaturing buffer, by incubation for 5 min at 100 °C. The eluted amount was digested in the reaction buffer of either Endo H or PNGaseF with 500 units of Endo H or PNGase F for 18 h at 37 °C, run in SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography. We monitored TRP-1 folding in pulse-labeled B16 cells by immunoprecipitation of cell lysates at different chase time points with αPEP1 antiserum (34Aroca P. Urabe K. Kobayashi T. Tsukamoto K. Hearing V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25650-25655Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and analysis of TRP-1 by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In non-reducing SDS-PAGE, a protein in an open or reduced conformation migrates slower than its compact or oxidized form. As shown in Fig.1 A, the slower migrating bands observed at 0 and 15 min of chase (lanes 1 and 2) are replaced by a faster migrating band at 30 min (lane 3). This indicates that the TRP-1 chain collapses to a compact form in 30 min after synthesis. No further increase in mobility at 45, 60, or 120 min of chase was detected (lanes 4–6) showing that further processing to complex type N-glycans has no effect on the migration of TRP-1. A similar behavior was observed for tyrosinase in non-reducing gels (29Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Our interpretation is that in non-reducing gels, the migration velocity of TRP-1 is dominated by the form rather than by the molecular weight, which in turn is prevailing in reducing gels. To characterize the folding kinetics of the TRP-1 chain, the above samples were analyzed in SDS-PAGE under (a) non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions, (b) denaturing and non-reducing conditions, and (c) denaturing and reducing conditions (see “Materials and Methods”). As can be observed in Fig. 1 B a faster migration was detected for the non-denatured (a) versus denatured (b) samples at 15, 30, and 45 min (lanes 4 and 5, 7and 8, and 10 and 11). However, no differences in the TRP-1 sample migration at 0 min of chase before and after thermal denaturation can be detected (lanes 1 and2). This indicates that some secondary structures are gradually formed in TRP-1 during folding. Moreover, the reduced forms of TRP-1 (c) migrate significantly higher than the non-reduced denatured ones (b) at all chase points, and this proves that TRP-1 carries disulfides. To determine whether the S—S bonds are involved in TRP-1 folding, we analyzed the folding process in the presence of the reducing agent DTT. This agent can quickly penetrate across the cell membrane and prevents the formation of disulfides in nascent proteins (20Braakman I. Helenius J. Helenius A EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1717-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 35Tatu U. Braakman I. Helenius A. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2151-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated 5 min before pulse, pulse-labeled, and chased in the presence of 5 mm DTT. Before lysis, the cells were incubated for 1 h with 20 mm NEM to block the free SH groups and to prevent the nonspecific formation of S—S bonds. TRP-1 was immunoprecipitated from untreated and DTT-treated cell lysates, and samples were analyzed in non-reducing conditions in SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). In all DTT-treated samples, TRP-1 migrates as a band with constant mobility representing TRP-1 in its fully reduced conformation (lanes 2, 4, 6, and8). In the absence of DTT, TRP-1 at 0 min chase (lane 1) is already in a partially folded conformation demonstrated by its slightly increased mobility, when compared with the TRP-1 DTT-treated (lane 2). The difference between the DTT-treated and untreated samples at 15 min chase (lanes 3 and4) is even more pronounced indicating that TRP-1 chain becomes more compact within this period. It can be estimated that 30 min post-pulse TRP-1 has attained the fully oxidized conformation, as the difference in the electrophoretic mobility between DTT-treated and untreated samples at 30 and 45 min chase is identical (lanes 5 and 6 and 7 and 8). Since in the presence of DTT, the appearance of the fully oxidized chain is prevented, it can be assumed that the two folding intermediates observed at 0 and 30 min (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and3 and Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 5) are different disulfide intermediates. To discriminate between the different folding stages of TRP-1, an experiment was designed to block the formation of disulfide bridges at various stages during TRP-1 folding followed by the monitoring of the maturation pathway of the intermediates of folding (Fig.3). Cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min and chased for 0, 15, 30, and 45 min in normal medium before the addition of DTT to each sample. The chase was continued for another 45 min in the presence of the reducing agent; hence, the total chase time in this experiment was 45, 60, 75, and 90 min, respectively. At the end of the chase time cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with αPEP1 antiserum and analyzed in reducing SDS-PAGE to monitor the maturation of the folding intermediates (lanes 1–4). In a control experiment TRP-1 maturation in untreated cells, at 0, 15, 45, and 60 min of chase, was analyzed (lanes 5–8). TRP-1 immunoprecipitated from cells where DTT was added immediately after pulse or after 15 min and chased for 45 min migrates as a partially glycosylated precursor of approximately 69 kDa (lanes 1 and2). In contrast, the control from untreated cells migrates as a band of approximately 69 kDa at 0 and 15 min of chase (lanes 5 and 6) and as a 75-kDa form at 45 and 60 min of chase (lanes 7 and 8). The 75-kDa form of TRP-1 can be visualized in the samples in which DTT was added after 30 or 45 min chase and maintained for 45 min (lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that within approximately 30 min in the absence of the reducing agent TRP-1 attained a native conformation stabilized by the formation of S—S bonds, which is not affected by the presence of DTT in the culture medium. To investigate the role of disulfides in TRP-1 maturation, the samples from the previous pulse-chase experiment (presented in Fig.2) were analyzed under reducing conditions (Fig.4 A). TRP-1 chain from untreated cells migrates at 69 kDa for the first 15 min (lanes 1 and 3) showing an increase in molecular mass to 75 kDa at 45 min of chase (lane 5). In DTT-treated cells, TRP-1 migrated as a 69-kDa precursor for all chase times analyzed (lanes 2, 4, and 6) suggesting that no maturation occurred in the presence of DTT. Our previous studies have shown that within 1 h of chase TRP-1 acquires complex oligosaccharides becoming partially resistant to Endo H digestion (14Negroiu G. Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 659-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, after Endo H treatment, which completely removes high mannose and hybrid oligosaccharides attached to the polypeptide, TRP-1 from DTT-treated sample at 1 h of chase co-migrated with untreated TRP-1 at 0 min of chase (Fig. 4 A, lanes 7 and 8). These results indicate that the glycans attached on TRP-1 synthesized in the continuous presence of DTT were not further processed to complex structures. To monitor the degradation process of TRP-1 synthesized in the presence of DTT, TRP-1 samples immunoprecipitated from B16 cells pulse-chased for the time points shown in Fig. 4 B were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. There was a significant decrease in the intensity of the TRP-1 band from 0 to 1 h of chase (lanes 1 and 2) followed by a gradual disappearance of the band. In contrast, TRP-1 in the untreated cells was shown to have a half-life longer than 5 h (data not shown) indicating that TRP-1 degradation is accelerated when the glycoprotein is synthesized in the continuous presence of DTT. TRP-1 is a glycoprotein with 6 potentialN-glycosylation sites. To determine whetherN-glycosylation has a role in TRP-1 folding, we monitored TRP-1 folding in the presence of N-butyl-deoxynojirimicin (NB-DNJ). NB-DNJ is an inhibitor of α-glucosidases I and II, which prevents N-glycan trimming in ER compartment and calnexin binding to the monoglucosylated protein precursors (28Petrescu S.M. Petrescu A.J. Titu H.N. Dwek R.A. Platt F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15796-15803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Two hours before pulse the inhibitor was added to the culture medium to a concentration of 5 mm and maintained during the pulse-chase process. The cells were pulsed for 10 min with [35S]methionine and chased for 0, 15, and 60 min. TRP-1 immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates was analyzed in SDS-PAGE under (a) non-denaturing and non-reducing conditions, (b) denaturing and non-reducing conditions, and (c) denaturing and reducing conditions as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig.5 A the native (a) and denatured non-reduced (b) samples co-migrate in SDS-PAGE for all chase time points. Unlike TRP-1 normally processed, TRP-1 from NB-DNJ-treated cells does not change its conformation after thermal denaturation. The reduced form of TRP-1 (c) from NB-DNJ-treated cells migrated in a slightly higher position than the non-reduced forms, and this served as a proof for the presence of disulfide bonds. It could be concluded that the TRP-1 polypeptide chain was able to fold into an oxidized form despite the presence of theN-glycosylation inhibitor in the culture medium. Since the folding rate of tyrosinase is considerably accelerated in the presence of NB-DNJ (29Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Wormald M.R. Platt F.M. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine the kinetics of folding to a stable conformation of the TRP-1 chain under similar conditions. Cells were incubated for 2 h in the presence of 5 mm NB-DNJ, pulsed for 10 min, and chased in the presence of the inhibitor for 0, 15, 30, and 45 min. After chase, 5 mmDTT was added to each sample, and the chase was continued in the presence of both NB-DNJ and DTT. For better evidence of the TRP maturation along the indicated chase points, samples were digested with Endo H (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1–4). A sample of mature TRP-1, synthesized in the presence of NB-DNJ only, was completely deglycosylated with PNGase F thus indicating the position of the TRP-1 polypeptide (lane 5). The results of this experiment show that when TRP-1 is synthesized in the presence of NB-DNJ up to 15 min post-pulse and another 45 min with both NB-DNJ and DTT, the protein remained totally sensitive to Endo H (lanes 1 and2). When DTT is added after 30 and 45 min and maintained for another 45 min, TRP-1 synthesized in the presence of the inhibitor becomes more resistant to Endo H and acquires oligosaccharides of complex structure (lanes 3 and 4). The Endo H digestion pattern of the last two chase points is similar with the pattern of mature NB-DNJ TRP-1 reported previously (14Negroiu G. Branza-Nichita N. Petrescu A.J. Dwek R.A. Petrescu S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 659-665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results indicate that TRP-1 synthesized in the presence of NB-DNJ acquires the competent transport conformation, being resistant to further DTT exposure, within approximately the same time as TRP-1 from untreated cells. By having established that inhibition of glucose trimming influences TRP-1 folding, investigations were performed to determine the role of the chaperone calnexin in TRP-1 folding. B16 cells were pulse-labeled for 10 min with [35S]methionine and chased for 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 min. Cells were lysed in HEPES/CHAPS buffer that preserves the interactions of calnexin with substrate proteins (36Hebert D.N. Zhang J.X. Chen W. Foellmer B. Helenius A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2075865407,"A peptide corresponding to residues 681–690 of the II-III loop of the skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor α1 subunit (DHPR, α1S) has been reported to activate the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1)in vitro. Within this region of α1S, a cluster of basic residues, Arg681–Lys685, was previously reported to be indispensable for the activation of RyR1 in microsomal preparations and lipid bilayers. We have used an intact α1S subunit with scrambled sequence in this region of the II-III loop (α1S-scr) to test the importance of residues 681–690 and the basic motif for skeletal-type excitation-contraction (EC) coupling and retrograde signaling in vivo. When expressed in dysgenic myotubes (which lack endogenous α1S), α1S-scr restored calcium currents that were indistinguishable, in current density and voltage dependence, from those restored by wild-type α1S. The scrambled DHPR also rescued skeletal-type EC coupling, as indicated by electrically evoked contractions in the presence of 0.5 mmCd2+ and 0.1 mm La3+. Furthermore, the release of intracellular Ca2+, as assayed by the indicator dye, Fluo-3, had similar kinetics and voltage dependence for α1S and α1S-scr. These data suggest that residues 681–690 of the α1S II-III loop are not essential in muscle cells for normal functioning of the DHPR, including skeletal-type EC coupling and retrograde signaling.

The mechanism of EC coupling differs in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle, calcium influx through the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac DHPR (α1C) activates RyRs (1Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, in skeletal muscle, EC coupling is independent of the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (2Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and may result instead from a mechanical coupling between the skeletal DHPR α1 subunit (α1S) and the skeletal muscle RyR isoform (RyR1). Expression of α1S/α1C chimeras in dysgenic myotubes (which lack endogenous α1 subunits) has established that skeletal-type EC coupling depends upon skeletal sequence within the putative cytoplasmic region between repeats II and III (II-III loop, amino acids 666–791 (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)). Chimeric DHPRs in which smaller segments of the skeletal DHPR were substituted into the cardiac DHPR subsequently identified residues 720–765 within the II-III loop as critical for activation of skeletal-type EC coupling (4Nakai J.

Moreover, this same critical region is essential for “retrograde signaling,” whereby RyR1 enhances the current density of α1S (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, observations in vitro indicate that a different region of the II-III loop, residues 671–690 (“peptide A”), is important for activation of RyR1, as indicated by ryanodine binding, single channel activity, and calcium release (7El-Hayek R.

Within peptide A, residues 681–690 have been identified as the “minimum essential region” of the DHPR II-III loop for activating ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the integrity of a cluster of five basic residues (Arg681–Lys685) is requisite for this region to serve as the physiological trigger for skeletal-type EC coupling (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether the specific sequence of residues 681–690 and the integrity of the cluster of positively charged residues are required for EC coupling in vivo, we have constructed a full-length DHPR with a scrambled sequence in residues 681–690 (α1S-scr). Dysgenic myotubes expressing α1S or α1S-scr did not differ in calcium current density, voltage dependence of activation, electrically evoked contractions, or voltage dependence of intracellular calcium release. These results indicate that neither the specific sequence of these residues, nor the integrity of the cluster of positive charges, is required for skeletal-type EC coupling in muscle cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAn expression plasmid encoding the pore-forming subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR (α1S (12Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar)) with scrambled residues 681–690 (α1S-scr) was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) using α1S as template. This construct is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The internal forward and reverse primers encoding the scrambled sequence were 5′-AAGGCCAAGGCCGAGGAGAGGAAAATGAGGTCGAGGGGCAAGCTTCGC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCCTCCTCTCTCTTGTCAGGGCGAAGCTTGCCCCTCGACCTCAT-3′. The mutagenized product was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GGGTCCTTCTTCATCCTCAACCTGGTGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGGATCTTTACCACGGAGATGGTGCTGGACT-3′. This final PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and was ligated into an expression plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of α1S (GFP-α1S(14Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). For this, GFP-α1S was digested with EcoRI (at nucleotide 1007 in the α1S coding sequence, generated by a partial digest) and XhoI (at nucleotide 2653 in the α1S coding sequence). The altered region of α1S-scr was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Primary cultures of myotubes were prepared from newborn dysgenic mice as described previously (15Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 week after plating, plasmids carrying cDNA for wild-type or mutant DHPRs (0.1–0.2 μg/μl) were microinjected into single nuclei. 36–72 h after injection, myotubes expressing DHPRs were identified by accumulation of green fluorescence. Expressing cells bathed in tissue culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Sigma) were examined for ability to contract in response to electrical stimulation (80–90 V, 10–30 ms). In some cases, 0.5 mm CdCl2 and 0.1 mm LaCl3 were added to the medium to block Ca2+ influx through DHPRs.Macroscopic Ca2+ currents and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured simultaneously (16Garcia J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using borosilicate glass patch pipettes with resistances of 1.5–3.0 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing (in mm) 1 MgCl2, 145 cesium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 2 CsCl, 0.1 EGTA, and 0.5 K5-Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The composition of the bath solution was 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.003 tetrodotoxin, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). In some experiments, 0.5 mm CdCl2 and 0.1 mmLaCl3 were added to the extracellular solution. The voltage clamp command sequence was to step from a holding potential of −80 mV to −30 mV for 1 s, to −50 mV for 30 ms, to the test potential for 200 ms, and back to −80 mV. Test currents were digitally corrected for linear leakage and capacitive currents. Ca2+ currents were normalized by linear cell capacitance (pA/pF). All data are presented as mean ± S.E.RESULTSTo test the importance of residues 681–690 for DHPR channel function, for retrograde signaling, and for EC coupling, we constructed a mammalian expression plasmid encoding the full-length pore-forming subunit of the skeletal DHPR (α1S) with a scrambled sequence in this region (α1S-scr, Fig.1 A). Note that the cluster of charged residues present in the wild-type sequence has been disrupted in α1S-scr. Whole-cell calcium currents recorded from dysgenic myotubes expressing α1S-scr closely resembled those recorded from myotubes expressing wild-type α1S(Fig. 1 B) and, like the wild-type currents, were abolished by application of 0.5 mm Cd2+ and 0.1 mm La3+ (data not shown). Fig. 1 Ccompares average peak I-V relationships for the two constructs, showing that they were similar in both voltage dependence and magnitude. Peak current densities at +40 mV were −5.06 ± 1.12 pA/pF (n = 14) and −5.11 ± 0.74 pA/pF (n = 10) for α1S and α1S-scr, respectively.To assay the ability of α1S-scr to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling, dysgenic myotubes expressing either α1S or α1S-scr were tested both for contraction in response to extracellular stimulation and for depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. As illustrated in Fig.2, wild-type α1S restored evoked contractions in 70% of fluorescent cells tested and α1S-scr restored contractions in 79% of cells tested. Myotubes expressing either α1S (67%) or α1S-scr (53%) retained the ability to contract even after the addition of 0.5 mm Cd2+ and 0.1 mm La3+ to the bathing medium to block Ca2+ entry.Figure 2Scrambled sequence in the II-III loop does not prevent the ability of DHPRs to restore EC coupling to dysgenic myotubes. Dysgenic myotubes expressing either α1S or α1S-scr were bathed in normal medium (gray bars) or in medium containing 0.5 mm Cd2+and 0.1 mm La3+ (hatched bars). The cells were stimulated electrically (10 ms, 90 V), and the percentage observed to contract is indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As a further test of whether α1S-scr differs from α1S, we measured intracellular Ca2+ release in voltage-clamped cells by recording changes in fluorescence of the Ca2+ indicator dye, Fluo-3. In both normal medium and medium containing Cd2+ and La3+, calcium transients generated by α1S-scr were similar, in time course and size, to those produced by wild-type α1S (Fig.3, A–D). The voltage dependence of calcium release was also similar and for both constructs showed a sigmoidal response that saturated at strong depolarizations (Fig. 3 E).Figure 3Scrambled sequence in the II-III loop does not alter the ability of DHPRs to elicit voltage-activated intracellular calcium release.

Thus, the function of α1S as a calcium channel and its ability to participate in EC coupling appear to be unaffected by either the specific sequence of residues 681–690 or the integrity of a cluster of basic residues in this region.The ability of α1S-scr to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling is consistent with earlier work on α1S/α1C chimeras, which showed that strong skeletal-type EC coupling occurred when a critical domain of the II-III loop, residues 720–765, was skeletal in origin (4Nakai J.

The ability of these chimeras to produce skeletal coupling was independent of whether there was skeletal or cardiac sequence for residues 681–690. The interchangeability of cardiac and skeletal sequence in this region could simply be a consequence of sequence conservation or could mean that the sequence of these residues is unimportant for skeletal-type EC coupling. The present results strongly support the latter conclusion.In vitro studies have shown that RyR1 is activated by a peptide composed of residues 681–690 (see Fig. 1 A; Ref. 10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) or by a slightly larger peptide (peptide A; residues 671–690 (7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J.

This activation is dependent on the integrity of a group of five basic residues within this region (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have now shown that skeletal-type EC coupling still occurs in muscle cells expressing α1S bearing a scrambled sequence in the peptide A region, even though the same scrambled sequence abolished the ability of residues 681–690 to activate RyR1 (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus it seems unlikely that in vitro activation of RyR1 by peptides implies in vivo activation of RyR1 by the corresponding region of the II-III loop. The activation by loop peptides may occur as a consequence of action at sites inaccessible to the intact II-III loop or may result from free solution conformations of the peptides that do not occur natively.In conclusion, it is clear from our results that residues 681–690 are not required for EC coupling in vivo. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that residues 681–690 play some role in EC coupling, since moderate decreases in calcium release or efficacy of EC coupling would be difficult to detect with our methods. Excitation-contraction (EC)1 coupling in skeletal and cardiac muscle involves a functional interaction between dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs), voltage-gated l-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma, and ryanodine receptors (RyRs), calcium release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The mechanism of EC coupling differs in skeletal and cardiac muscle. In cardiac muscle, calcium influx through the pore-forming subunit of the cardiac DHPR (α1C) activates RyRs (1Nabauer M. Callewaert G. Cleemann L. Morad M. Science. 1989; 244: 800-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). However, in skeletal muscle, EC coupling is independent of the entry of extracellular Ca2+ (2Armstrong C.M. Bezanilla F.M. Horowicz P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 267: 605-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) and may result instead from a mechanical coupling between the skeletal DHPR α1 subunit (α1S) and the skeletal muscle RyR isoform (RyR1). Expression of α1S/α1C chimeras in dysgenic myotubes (which lack endogenous α1 subunits) has established that skeletal-type EC coupling depends upon skeletal sequence within the putative cytoplasmic region between repeats II and III (II-III loop, amino acids 666–791 (3Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Adams B.A. Niidome T. Numa S. Nature. 1990; 346: 567-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar)). Chimeric DHPRs in which smaller segments of the skeletal DHPR were substituted into the cardiac DHPR subsequently identified residues 720–765 within the II-III loop as critical for activation of skeletal-type EC coupling (4Nakai J. Tanabe T. Konno T. Adams B. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24983-24986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 5Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Suda N. Beam K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21913-21919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Moreover, this same critical region is essential for “retrograde signaling,” whereby RyR1 enhances the current density of α1S (6Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). On the other hand, observations in vitro indicate that a different region of the II-III loop, residues 671–690 (“peptide A”), is important for activation of RyR1, as indicated by ryanodine binding, single channel activity, and calcium release (7El-Hayek R. Antoniu B. Wang J. Hamilton S.L. Ikemoto N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22116-22118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 8Dulhunty A.F. Laver D.R. Gallant E.M.

Dulhunty A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11631-11637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Within peptide A, residues 681–690 have been identified as the “minimum essential region” of the DHPR II-III loop for activating ryanodine binding and Ca2+ release (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), and it has been suggested that the integrity of a cluster of five basic residues (Arg681–Lys685) is requisite for this region to serve as the physiological trigger for skeletal-type EC coupling (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether the specific sequence of residues 681–690 and the integrity of the cluster of positively charged residues are required for EC coupling in vivo, we have constructed a full-length DHPR with a scrambled sequence in residues 681–690 (α1S-scr). Dysgenic myotubes expressing α1S or α1S-scr did not differ in calcium current density, voltage dependence of activation, electrically evoked contractions, or voltage dependence of intracellular calcium release. These results indicate that neither the specific sequence of these residues, nor the integrity of the cluster of positive charges, is required for skeletal-type EC coupling in muscle cells. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAn expression plasmid encoding the pore-forming subunit of the skeletal muscle DHPR (α1S (12Tanabe T. Takeshima H. Mikami A. Flockerzi V. Takahashi H. Kangawa K. Kojima M. Matsuo H. Hirose T. Numa S. Nature. 1987; 328: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar)) with scrambled residues 681–690 (α1S-scr) was constructed by overlapping PCR mutagenesis (13Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6797) Google Scholar) using α1S as template. This construct is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 A. The internal forward and reverse primers encoding the scrambled sequence were 5′-AAGGCCAAGGCCGAGGAGAGGAAAATGAGGTCGAGGGGCAAGCTTCGC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCCTCCTCTCTCTTGTCAGGGCGAAGCTTGCCCCTCGACCTCAT-3′. The mutagenized product was amplified using the primer pair 5′-GGGTCCTTCTTCATCCTCAACCTGGTGCTGGGC-3′ and 5′-GAGGATCTTTACCACGGAGATGGTGCTGGACT-3′. This final PCR product was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and was ligated into an expression plasmid encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N terminus of α1S (GFP-α1S(14Grabner M. Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1903-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar)). For this, GFP-α1S was digested with EcoRI (at nucleotide 1007 in the α1S coding sequence, generated by a partial digest) and XhoI (at nucleotide 2653 in the α1S coding sequence). The altered region of α1S-scr was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.Primary cultures of myotubes were prepared from newborn dysgenic mice as described previously (15Adams B.A. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1989; 94: 429-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 week after plating, plasmids carrying cDNA for wild-type or mutant DHPRs (0.1–0.2 μg/μl) were microinjected into single nuclei. 36–72 h after injection, myotubes expressing DHPRs were identified by accumulation of green fluorescence. Expressing cells bathed in tissue culture medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, Sigma) were examined for ability to contract in response to electrical stimulation (80–90 V, 10–30 ms). In some cases, 0.5 mm CdCl2 and 0.1 mm LaCl3 were added to the medium to block Ca2+ influx through DHPRs.Macroscopic Ca2+ currents and intracellular Ca2+ transients were measured simultaneously (16Garcia J. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using borosilicate glass patch pipettes with resistances of 1.5–3.0 MΩ when filled with an internal solution containing (in mm) 1 MgCl2, 145 cesium glutamate, 10 HEPES, 2 CsCl, 0.1 EGTA, and 0.5 K5-Fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). The composition of the bath solution was 10 CaCl2, 145 tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.003 tetrodotoxin, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). In some experiments, 0.5 mm CdCl2 and 0.1 mmLaCl3 were added to the extracellular solution. The voltage clamp command sequence was to step from a holding potential of −80 mV to −30 mV for 1 s, to −50 mV for 30 ms, to the test potential for 200 ms, and back to −80 mV. Test currents were digitally corrected for linear leakage and capacitive currents. Ca2+ currents were normalized by linear cell capacitance (pA/pF). All data are presented as mean ± S.E.

RESULTSTo test the importance of residues 681–690 for DHPR channel function, for retrograde signaling, and for EC coupling, we constructed a mammalian expression plasmid encoding the full-length pore-forming subunit of the skeletal DHPR (α1S) with a scrambled sequence in this region (α1S-scr, Fig.1 A). Note that the cluster of charged residues present in the wild-type sequence has been disrupted in α1S-scr. Whole-cell calcium currents recorded from dysgenic myotubes expressing α1S-scr closely resembled those recorded from myotubes expressing wild-type α1S(Fig. 1 B) and, like the wild-type currents, were abolished by application of 0.5 mm Cd2+ and 0.1 mm La3+ (data not shown). Fig. 1 Ccompares average peak I-V relationships for the two constructs, showing that they were similar in both voltage dependence and magnitude. Peak current densities at +40 mV were −5.06 ± 1.12 pA/pF (n = 14) and −5.11 ± 0.74 pA/pF (n = 10) for α1S and α1S-scr, respectively.To assay the ability of α1S-scr to mediate skeletal-type EC coupling, dysgenic myotubes expressing either α1S or α1S-scr were tested both for contraction in response to extracellular stimulation and for depolarization-induced Ca2+ release. As illustrated in Fig.2, wild-type α1S restored evoked contractions in 70% of fluorescent cells tested and α1S-scr restored contractions in 79% of cells tested.

This activation is dependent on the integrity of a group of five basic residues within this region (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 11Zhu X. Gurrola G. Jiang M.T. Walker J.W. Valdivia H.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 450: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We have now shown that skeletal-type EC coupling still occurs in muscle cells expressing α1S bearing a scrambled sequence in the peptide A region, even though the same scrambled sequence abolished the ability of residues 681–690 to activate RyR1 (10El-Hayek R. Ikemoto N. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7015-7020Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Thus it seems unlikely that in vitro activation of RyR1 by peptides implies in vivo activation of RyR1 by the corresponding region of the II-III loop. The activation by loop peptides may occur as a consequence of action at sites inaccessible to the intact II-III loop or may result from free solution conformations of the peptides that do not occur natively. In conclusion, it is clear from our results that residues 681–690 are not required for EC coupling in vivo. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that residues 681–690 play some role in EC coupling, since moderate decreases in calcium release or efficacy of EC coupling would be difficult to detect with our methods.

Mechanistically we understand little of the apparently complex interactions of this molecular chaperone. Recently, progress has been made in assigning some of the known functions of hsp90, such as nucleotide binding and peptide binding, to particular domains within the protein. We used fragments of hsp90 and chimeric proteins containing functional domains from hsp90 or its mitochondrial homolog, TRAP1, to study the requirements for this protein in the folding of firefly luciferase as well as in the prevention of citrate synthase aggregation. In agreement with others who have found peptide binding and limited chaperone ability in fragments of hsp90, we see that multiple fragments from hsp90 can prevent the aggregation of thermally denatured citrate synthase, a measure of passive chaperoning activity. However, in contrast to these results, the luciferase folding assay was found to be much more demanding. Here, folding is mediated by hsp70 and hsp40, requires ATP, and thus is a measure of active chaperoning. Hsp90 and the co-chaperone, Hop, enhance this process. This hsp90 activity was only observed using full-length hsp90 indicating that the cooperation of multiple functional domains is essential for active, chaperone-mediated folding.

Although the association of hsp90 with its co-chaperones is dependent on its nucleotide state (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

In many of these processes, hsp90 does not act alone, but requires the aid of several co-chaperone proteins (6Buchner J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 7Toft D.O. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 1998; 9: 238-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interaction of hsp90 with its co-chaperones has been studied most extensively in the assembly of steroid receptor complexes (6Buchner J. Trends Biochem.

In this process, hsp90 is found in two distinct complexes characterized by the presence of different sets of co-chaperone proteins. When it first enters steroid receptor complexes, hsp90 is associated with Hop and hsp70 (15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar, 16Chen S. Prapapanich V. Rimerman R.A. Honore B. Smith D.F. Mol. Endo. 1996; 10: 682-693Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hop is a 60-kDa protein that is capable of binding both hsp70 and hsp90 when these proteins are in their ADP-bound state (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

As the steroid receptor complex progresses toward the mature form capable of binding hormone, more hsp90 enters the complex while hsp70 and Hop levels diminish (15Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocr.

This mature form is also characterized by the appearance of the hsp90 co-chaperone p23, which interacts specifically with ATP-bound hsp90 (14Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt C. Bartha B. McMahon N.

Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1543) Google Scholar). Similar complexes between hsp90 and its co-chaperones are also found in the absence of any substrate protein, indicating that pre-assembled multiprotein complexes may act to chaperone a variety of substrate proteins (16Chen S.

In addition to its role in the maturation of cell-signaling molecules, hsp90 has also been shown to play a role in more general protein folding. It is able to suppress the aggregation of denatured citrate synthase and β-galactosidase and maintain these enzymes in a refoldable state (22Bose S. Weikl W. Bugl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 23Freeman B.C. Toft D.O. Morimoto R.I. Science. 1996; 274: 1718-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). It also potentiates the refolding of firefly luciferase, in vitro and in vivo, by hsp70 and hsp40 (Ydj1) (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

A fragment containing the carboxyl-terminal 194 residues of hsp90 has been shown to convert MyoD1 to an active conformation in vitro (26Shaknovich R. Shue G. Kohtz D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5059-5068Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently, Scheibel et al. (27Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) and Young et al. (28Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) have reported that hsp90 contains two independent chaperone sites: one in the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain and the other in the carboxyl-terminal domain. Fragments containing these chaperone sites are able to bind to peptides with differing specificities and suppress the aggregation of unfolded proteins. An assay for the chaperone-mediated refolding of thermally denatured firefly luciferase has been described previously (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 25Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this system, the chaperones hsp70 and the yeast hsp40, Ydj1, are absolute requirements for the refolding process. Hsp90 can enhance refolding under many conditions, functioning in both a passive, ATP-independent manner, and in an active, ATP-dependent manner that can be augmented by Hop (12Johnson B.D.

These data, combined with recent reports regarding the abilities of two separate hsp90 fragments to act as chaperones prompted us to test a variety of hsp90 constructs for chaperone activity. In order to better define the functional domains of hsp90 involved in active and passive refolding processes, we tested a number of deletion mutants of hsp90 along with two chimeric forms of hsp90 and its mitochondrial homolog TRAP1 (29Chen C.F.

The striking feature of the data is that while the suppression of citrate synthase aggregation can be accomplished by small fragments from within hsp90, essentially the entire hsp90 sequence is necessary for proper functioning in the refolding of luciferase. Wild-type, chicken hsp90, and the fragments of hsp90 shown in Fig. 1 were constructed using polymerase chain reaction to generate DNA fragments encoding the appropriate amino- and carboxyl-terminal protein sequences (32Meng X. Devin J. Sullivan W.P. Toft D.O. Baulieu E.-E. Catelli M.G. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1677-1687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These were subcloned into the pGEX expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) such that the initiating methionine is in-frame with the GST. The sequences of the final plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography followed by Mono Q chromatography. The hsp90/TRAP1 chimeric proteins, N90-TRAP andNC90-TRAP, were constructed using polymerase chain reaction to generate DNA fragments encoding the appropriate amino- and carboxyl-terminal protein sequences. The primers h90b-85(NdeI) 5′-GATCGATCCATATGCCTGAGGAAGTGCACCATGGA-3′ and either h90b-726rev(EcoRV) 5′-GGTGATGGGATATCCTATGAACTGAGAATG-3′ (for N90-TRAP) or h90b-920rev(ClaI) 5′-TGATCGATGTATTTCTCTTTGATCTTCTTAGT-3′ (for NC90-TRAP) were used to generate amino-terminal hsp90-encoding DNA fragments. The primer TRAP1–803RV 5′-GATCGATCGATATCCCATCTACTTGAATGGAAGGCGGATGAAC-3′ or TRAP1–812Cla 5′-GTATCGATGGAAGGCGGATGAACACCTTGCA-3′ and SF-4 5′-AGTCAGTCGGATCCTTATCAGTGTCGCTCCAGGGCCTTGAC-3′ were used to generate carboxyl-terminal TRAP1-encoding DNA fragments. The NH2-terminal hsp90 DNA fragments were digested withNdeI and EcoRV or NdeI andClaI. The COOH-terminal TRAP1 DNA fragments were digested with EcoRV or ClaI and BamHI. Each pair of fragments was then ligated intoNdeI/BamHI-digested pET9a. The sequences of the final plasmids were confirmed by automated DNA sequencing.N90-TRAP and NC90-TRAP proteins were produced in BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and purified as described previously for TRAP1 (30Felts S.J.

Cell lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, followed by heparin-agarose and Mono Q chromatography. The preparation was greater than 99% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Human hsp70 was expressed in Sf9 cells (33Alnemri E.S. Litwack G.

Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose and ATP-agarose column chromatography. This was precipitated using ammonium sulfate (75% saturation), and the redissolved hsp70 was fractionated by 16/60 Superdex 200 FPLC. Only the monomer peak of hsp70 was used. The preparation was approximately 97% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Human Hop expressed in bacteria was prepared essentially as described previously (34Schumacher R.J. Hurst R. Sullivan W.P. McMahon N.J. Toft D.O. Matts R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9493-9499Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. Additional purification was achieved by fractionating the pool from hydroxylapatite on a Mono Q column (10/10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The preparation was approximately 94% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. A bacterial expression system for Ydj1p was supplied by Dr. Avrom Caplan, and has been described previously (35Caplan A.J. Tsai J. Casey P. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18890-18895Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Bacterial lysates were fractionated by DEAE-cellulose and hydroxylapatite column chromatography. The preparation was approximately 80% pure as assessed by densitometry of SDS-PAGE gels. Protein concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. Tris buffer (TB) was 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. Stability buffer (SB) was 25 mm Tricine-HCl, pH 7.8, 8 mmMgSO4, 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, and 0.25% Triton X-100. Geldanamycin was obtained from the Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, Developmental Therapeutics Program, Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, National Cancer Institute. The thermal aggregation of citrate synthase molecules was measured as described previously (36Jakob U. Lilie H. Meyer I. Buchner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7288-7294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Citrate synthase (0.115 μm), in 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, was incubated at 43 °C to allow denaturation and aggregation to occur. The increase in optical density due to light scattering was measured at 336 nm to determine the extent of aggregation of the citrate synthase. These assays were carried out in the presence or absence of a variety of hsp90 constructs, at 0.575 μm each, five times the concentration of citrate synthase. Luciferase refolding assays were performed as described previously (25Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Firefly luciferase, 100 nm in SB, was heat denatured at 40 °C for 15 min to ∼0.2% of its original activity. This was diluted 10-fold into a refolding mixture containing purified chaperone proteins, 2 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system in TB. The refolding mixture was incubated at 25 °C to promote folding, and at the indicated times following addition of denatured luciferase, aliquots were removed and luciferase activity was measured in a luminometer. We performed all of the luciferase assays under conditions optimized to detect the hsp90 effect, which involved working at above optimal concentrations of hsp70. Because of this, misfolded proteins in the hsp90 fragment preparations could decrease the effective concentration of hsp70 and cause an increase in luciferase refolding by hsp70 and Ydj1 alone. This could easily be misinterpreted as a positive effect of the hsp90 preparation, and may account for the slight effects seen with some of the hsp90 fragment preparations. All assays were repeated several times and the results shown are typical of those results. Hop binding to hsp90, TRAP1,N90-TRAP, and NC90-TRAP was assayed using 10 μg of each protein under conditions previously shown to be optimal for hsp90-Hop complex formation in vitro (25 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5 mm MgCl2) (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The protein mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and added to antibody-protein A resins as indicated in the figure legends. The immunoprecipitations were incubated on ice for 1 h with occasional mixing and then washed four times with 1 ml of cold buffer. The proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. Previous studies have demonstrated the existence of two independent peptide-binding sites in hsp90 (27Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 28Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). One of these sites is located in the amino-terminal nucleotide-binding domain of hsp90 and appears to be influenced by the highly charged region immediately following this domain (37Scheibel T. Siegmund H.I. Jaenicke R. Ganz P. Lilie H. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1297-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The other peptide-binding site is located near the carboxyl terminus. We used fragments of hsp90 fused to the dimeric protein, glutathione S-transferase (GST) to inhibit the aggregation of citrate synthase during thermal denaturation and confirm the existence of chaperone sites in both ends of hsp90. The hsp90 fragments used in this paper are shown in Fig.1. When denatured at 43 °C, citrate synthase aggregates; however, hsp90, at a molar ratio of 5:1, can prevent this aggregation to a large degree (see Fig. 6). The GST-wt construct also can effectively prevent citrate synthase aggregation, but GST alone lacks this ability (Fig.2). In accordance with the results reported by others, a fragment from the amino terminus, GST-(1–573), and a fragment from the carboxyl terminus, GST-(446–728), are also able to suppress the aggregation of citrate synthase (Fig. 2). Additionally, fragments GST-(1–332), GST-(1–698), GST-(206–728), and GST-(287–728) were tested and each one is able to prevent citrate synthase from aggregating (summarized in Fig. 1). A fragment of hsp90 encoding residues 1–573 without GST was also expressed and like its partner, GST-(1–573), it is able to suppress citrate synthase aggregation, although it is less efficient than GST-(1–573) (Fig. 2). This may be due to the fact that GST-(1–573) is a dimer while 1–573 alone appears to be a monomer (not shown). In previous work by Young et al. (28Young J.C. Schneider C. Hartl F.U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) it can also be seen that hsp90 fragments are more efficient at preventing rhodanese aggregation when they are fused to GST. Surprisingly, a fragment containing only a small portion of hsp90 from the central part of the molecule, GST-(206–446), is able to prevent the aggregation of thermally denatured citrate synthase as well (Fig. 2) suggesting this as an additional domain for peptide interaction.Figure 2Fragments of hsp90 are able to prevent citrate synthase aggregation. Aggregation of 0.115 μm citrate synthase was measured by the increase in absorbance due to light scattering during treatment at 43 °C for 1 h in the absence of any chaperone protein (■) and in the presence of five times the citrate synthase concentration (0.575 μm calculated as a monomer) of GST (○), GST-wt (Δ), GST-(1–573) (▪), GST-(206–446) (●), GST-(446–728) (▴), and 1–573 (♦), and plotted as a function of time.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested these same fragments for the ability to stimulate luciferase refolding by hsp70/Ydj1 in the absence and presence of Hop. When hsp90 is added to a refolding mixture containing hsp70 and Ydj1, it can substantially stimulate the refolding process (12Johnson B.D. Schumacher R.J. Ross E.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3679-3686Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 17Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The chaperoning of hsp90 in luciferase refolding has an active component that is ATP-dependent, potentiated by Hop, inhibited by GA, and inhibited by point mutations that block ATP binding or hydrolysis (17Grenert J.P. Johnson B.D. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17525-17533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 25Schumacher R.J. Hansen W.J. Freeman B.C. Alnemri E. Litwack G. Toft D.O. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 14889-14898Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The effect of hsp90 also has an ATP-independent component, termed passive chaperoning activity, that functions in the presence of GA and is unaffected by mutations in the ATP-binding site. We were interested in determining whether the fragments of hsp90 that can prevent aggregation also are able to participate in the refolding of firefly luciferase; a more stringent test of chaperone activity than simply binding to a protein to prevent its aggregation. We also wanted to determine whether the passive activity of hsp90 in luciferase refolding is the same activity we see in the ATP-independent citrate synthase assay, and whether we could identify discrete regions of hsp90 responsible for the active and passive chaperoning capacities. The addition of a GST tag to wild type hsp90 does not alter the function of hsp90 in luciferase refolding (Figs.3, A and B, 4,A and B). However, three GST fusion proteins containing amino-terminal fragments of hsp90, GST-(1–332), GST-(1–573), and GST-(1–698), are unable to stimulate luciferase refolding by hsp70 and Ydj1 either in the absence (Fig. 3 A) or presence (Fig. 3 B) of Hop despite the fact that each of these fragments is able to prevent citrate synthase aggregation. These hsp90 fragments are not aggregated and they have a functional ATP-binding domain that binds to ATP-Sepharose (results not shown). A fragment of hsp90 encoding residues 1–573 was also expressed and tested and, like its GST fusion protein, it shows no activity (not shown). Next, we tried an internal fragment from hsp90, GST-(206–446), and a fragment missing the charged region of hsp90 from residues 206–287, GST-ΔCR. Although both of these fragments can prevent citrate synthase aggregation, neither is able to stimulate luciferase refolding either in the absence (Fig.4 A) or presence (Fig.4 B) of Hop. Finally, we tried using carboxyl-terminal fragments of hsp90 in luciferase refolding, GST-(206–728) and GST-(287–728). Like the other fragments, these are able to prevent citrate synthase aggregation but unable to assist in luciferase refolding either in the absence (Fig.5 A) or in the presence (Fig.5 B) of Hop. These fragments do have the capacity to bind Hop (results not shown). Any inhibitory effect of GST can be ruled out because when the GST is cleaved from the amino terminus of GST-(287–728), the resulting fragment also has no activity (not shown). A comparison of the many hsp90 fragments in luciferase refolding (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) versus in aggregation prevention (Fig. 2) shows a vast difference in the chaperone requirements for these two assays (Fig. 1).Figure 4An internal fragment containing the charged domain of hsp90 and a fragment lacking the charged domain of hsp90 are unable to stimulate luciferase refolding.

https://openalex.org/W2149226102,"Stat3α and Stat3β are two Stat3 isoforms with marked quantitative differences in their DNA binding activities. To examine the molecular basis of the differential DNA binding activities, we measured DNA binding strength and dimer stability, two possible mechanisms responsible for these differences. Stat3α and Stat3β showed no difference in DNA binding strength, i.e. they had similar association and dissociation rates for DNA binding. However, competition analyses performed with dissociating reagents including an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, SH2 domain protein, and a phosphopeptide demonstrated that Stat3β dimers are more stable than Stat3α dimers. We report here that dimer stability of activated forms plays a critical role in determining DNA binding activity of Stat3 isoforms. We found that C-terminal deletions of Stat3α increased both DNA binding activity and dimer stability of Stat3α. Our findings suggest that the acidic C-terminal region of Stat3α does not interfere with the DNA binding of activated Stat3α dimers, but destabilizes the dimeric forms of Stat3α. We propose that dimer stability described in vitro may be the underlying mechanism of in vivostability of activated Stat3 proteins, regulating dephosphorylation of tyrosine 705.

Janus kinase signal transducer and activator of transcription epidermal growth factor Src homology domain 2 electrophoretic mobility shift assay high affinity c-fos sis-inducible element interleukin Extracellular signaling molecules such as cytokines and growth factors modulate the properties of cells through their binding to specific cell-surface receptors. For transducing the signals to the nucleus, the ligand-receptor binding activates one or more signaling pathways, ultimately regulating gene expression. Whereas the signals are relayed by a cascade of biochemical reactions in most signaling pathways, forming a network of signals, the studies on interferon-regulated gene expression revealed a direct signaling pathway from receptor to nucleus, the so called JAK1-STAT signaling pathway (1Leonard W.J. O'Shea J.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1493) Google Scholar, 2Schindler C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) forms a family of latent signaling transcription factors (Stat1 to Stat6) that are tyrosine-phosphorylated and activated by JAK (Janus kinase), a family of tyrosine kinases (Jak1, Jak2, Jak3, and Tyk2). Many cytokines and growth factors have been known to signal through JAK-STAT pathway (3Ivashkiv L.B. Immunity. 1995; 3: 1-4Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar,4Ihle J.N. Thierfelder W. Teglund S. Stravapodis D. Wang D. Feng J. Parganas E. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 865: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Jaks associate with cytokine receptors as inactive forms and become activated by ligand-induced receptor aggregation. The activated Jak proteins, in turn, phosphorylate receptors at multiple tyrosine residues, providing the docking sites for Stats. Since cytokine receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, the ability of the receptors to recruit and activate Jaks is critical for activating the downstream signaling pathways. The recruited Stats become accessible to and therefore phosphorylated by Jaks. Unlike cytokine receptors, growth factor receptors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) and platelet-derived growth factor receptors possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. There are reports suggesting the direct activation of Stats by receptor kinases (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). A single tyrosine residue (e.g. tyrosine 701 in Stat1 and tyrosine 705 in Stat3) has been assigned as the phosphorylation site (6Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar). After phosphorylation, Stats homo- or heterodimerize and then translocate to the nucleus, where they form active transcription complexes and regulate gene expression (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Stat proteins share several conserved functional domains. The most conserved region is an SH2 (Src homology 2) domain near the C terminus. The SH2 domain of Stat proteins mediates the selective binding to phosphotyrosine motifs of receptors (8Greenlund A.C. Morales M.O. Viviano B.L. Yan H. Krolewski J. Schreiber R.D. Immunity. 1995; 2: 677-687Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) as well as dimerization of Stats (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation at a single tyrosine residue is required for DNA binding activity of Stats, suggesting that dimerization through phosphotyrosine-SH2 domain interaction is essential for DNA binding of Stats (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). DNA binding activity of Stats has been attributed to a highly conserved DNA-binding domain in the middle of the protein (9Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 984-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). The selection of the optimal DNA binding sequences with random oligonucleotides showed that Stats have very similar preferences for DNA binding (10Seidel H.M. Milocco L.H. Lamb P. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stein R.B. Rosen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3041-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). The N-terminal region is also quite conserved among Stat proteins. Some reports suggest that the N terminus of Stats may be crucial for the interaction of Stats with other proteins including tyrosine kinases and phosphatases. Stat1 mutants lacking the N-terminal 141 or 216 amino acids are no longer tyrosine phosphorylated, although their SH2 domain and tyrosine phosphorylation site (tyrosine 701) remain intact (11Improta T. Schindler C. Horvath C.M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4776-4780Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Mutational analysis of Stat1 implies that the N-terminal region may also be involved in dephosphorylation of Stats (12Shuai K. Liao J. Song M.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4932-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Another study has proposed that besides a role in Stat deactivation, the N terminus may also be important for the regulation of nuclear translocation (13Strehlow I. Schindler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28049-28056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, the N terminus has been implicated in Stat-receptor interaction, as suggested by Stat2 association with interferon-α receptor (14Li X. Leung S. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2048-2056Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Other studies have found the N-terminal region important for cooperative DNA binding by Stat1-Stat1 dimers to two tandem DNA sites (15Vinkemeier U. Cohen S.L. Moarefi I. Chait B.T. Kuriyan J. Darnell Jr., J.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5616-5626Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Sequence alignment shows that the C-terminal region is the most divergent in sequence. Isoforms of Stat1 and Stat5 naturally occurring by alternative splicing of mRNA are short forms lacking the C-terminal region (16Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The observations that the splice variants have no transcriptional activity indicate the function of the C-terminal region as a transactivation domain (6Shuai K. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1993; 261: 1744-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 17Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Besides transcriptional activation, other properties appear to be regulated by the C-terminal region of Stats. Unlike the short forms of Stat1 and Stat5, Stat3β, a short form of Stat3α that was discovered as a c-Jun-interacting protein, has C-terminal 55 amino acid residues of Stat3α replaced with a unique 7 amino acid residues (18Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Studies comparing the properties of the two isoforms uncovered a marked quantitative difference in the DNA binding activities of phosphorylated Stat3α and -3β in vitro (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and in vivo (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, our studies suggest that the difference in dimer stability is the basis of the differential DNA binding activities of Stat3 isoforms. In addition, the studies with C-terminal deletion mutants of Stat3α lead us to propose that the C-terminal region may play an important role in regulating differential properties of Stat3 isoforms. Plasmids used in transfection experiments expressing Stat3α or -3β have been previously described (18Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids used for the expression in Sf9 insect cells were prepared as follows. DNA fragments containing either murine Stat3α or -3β were cloned into the cloning sites, EheI and HindIII, of the baculovirus expression vector, pFASTBAC HTa (Life Technologies, Inc.). The DNAs encoding Stat1 or Stat3 SH2 domain were prepared by polymerase chain reaction (amino acids 570–712 for Stat1 and 577–715 for Stat3) and inserted into EheI andHindIII cloning sites of pFASTBAC HTa. Plasmids expressing Δ5, Δ12, Δ19, Δ26, Δ33, Δ40, Δ48, and Δ55 were made by polymerase chain reaction amplification in which a 3′ primer introduced a stop codon after the indicated amino acid. Stat3 proteins with N-terminal hexahistidine tag were purified from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells, as described previously (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were prepared from cells co-infected with Jak1- and Jak2-expressing baculoviruses. SH2 domains of Stat1 and Stat3 were prepared under denaturing condition. Sf9 cells (6 × 107 cells) infected with SH2 domain-encoding baculoviruses were resuspended and lysed in 10 ml of lysis buffer (6 mguanidine HCl, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0) for 2 h at room temperature. Lysates were centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g to remove insoluble material and incubated with Ni2+ Probond resin (Invitrogen) for 1 h. The mixture of lysate and Ni2+resin was packed in a column and extensively washed with lysis buffer, followed by buffer A (8 m urea, 100 mm sodium phosphate, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Ni2+-bound proteins were eluted with a pH step gradient of pH 6.0, 5.0, and 3.5 in buffer A. SH2 proteins were eluted at pH 5.0. The purified SH2 proteins were incubated with 10 mm EDTA and serially dialyzed against a buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) containing 4, 2, 1, 0.5, and 0.1 m, and finally no urea. Purified Stat proteins or nuclear extracts were electrophoresed in SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected as previously reported (18Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The proteins labeled using anti-Stat3 (Trasduction Laboratories) or anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology) monoclonal antibody and 125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG were quantitated on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The determined protein concentrations were confirmed by quantitating autoradiograms with a densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). The amount of protein used through the experiments were corrected for tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat3 proteins, relative to phosphorylated Stat3α protein. Therefore, the protein concentrations indicate same tyrosine phosphorylation per unit protein. Purified Stat proteins or nuclear extracts were incubated with32P-labeled high affinity c-fos sis-inducible element (hSIE) (Santa Cruz) or IL-6-responsive element of α2-macroglobulin gene promoter (IL-6 RE) (5′-CCTTAATCCTTCTGGGAATTCTGGCTAACG-3′; Stat3 binding sequence is underlined) in 24 μl of a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After 15 min incubation at room temperature, the samples were electrophoresed on 4% polyacrylamide gels. For competition analyses, Stat proteins were incubated with the indicated amounts of each competitior for 15 min at room temperature before addition of the labeled oligonucleotides. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2. One day prior to transfection cells were plated at a density of 3 × 105 per 5-cm dish or 1 × 106 per 10-cm dish. Two hours before transfection the cells were fed with fresh Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum. Transfections were performed using the calcium phosphate method (20Gorman C.M. Merlino G.T. Willingham M.C. Pastan I. Howard B.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6777-6781Crossref PubMed Scopus (881) Google Scholar) using the amounts of DNA indicated in the figure legends. After 16 h cells were washed twice and fed Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing no serum. Forty hours post-transfection cells were stimulated with human recombinant EGF (100 ng/ml) (Upstate Biotechnology) for the indicated times and harvested for preparation of nuclear extracts or for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and β-galactosidase assays. Nuclear extracts were prepared by the method of Andrews (21Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar) with the inclusion of Na3VO4 (1 mm), 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 μg/ml pepstatin A. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity was normalized to β-galactosidase plasmid YN3214-lacZ. Experiments performed to determine the half-lives of the Stat3 deletion mutants used the previously described EGF receptor kinase inhibitor PD157655 (0.2 μm) (David Fry, Parke Davis). We previously reported that Stat3β activated by phosphorylation of tyrosine 705 was more active for DNA binding per unit phosphorylated protein than similarly activated Stat3α (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Whether phosphorylated by JAK in Sf9 insect cells or by the EGF receptor kinase in vitro, phosphorylated Stat3β was approximately 20-fold more active for DNA binding than phosphorylated Stat3α. To study the underlying mechanism of this quantitative difference in DNA binding, tyrosine 705-phosphorylated forms of Stat3α and -3β containing N-terminal polyhistidine were prepared from Sf9 cells co-infected with Stat3-, Jak1-, and Jak2-expressing baculoviruses as described previously (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The purified Stat3α and -3β were tyrosine phosphorylated at equivalent levels, as determined by quantifying immunoblots of the protein preparations using monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine or anti-Stat3 antibodies (data not shown). Fig. 1 A shows a comparison of DNA binding activities of the preparations of Stat3α and -3β used in this and subsequent experiments. Two binding sites were used: the high affinity c-fos sis-inducible element (hSIE), a strong binding site for Stat3 (22Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar); and the weaker IL-6-responsive element (IL-6RE) of the rat α2-macroglobulin gene promoter (23Wegenka U.M. Buschmann J. Lutticken C. Heinrich P.C. Horn F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 276-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Stat3β had approximately 25-fold (hSIE) or 15-fold (IL-6RE) greater DNA binding activity than Stat3α on a molar basis. Similar results were obtained with several other preparations of the Stat3 proteins (data not shown).Figure 1Differential DNA binding activities ofin vitro purified Stat3α and Stat3β proteins. A, EMSAs carried out with the indicated amounts of Stat3α and -3β.B, proposed equilibrium processes for DNA binding of Stat proteins. See the text for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Stat proteins bind to DNA as dimers formed by interaction of the SH2 domain of each monomer with a proximal phosphotyrosine (tyrosine 705 in the case of Stat3) of the other monomeric partner (7Shuai K. Horvath C.M. Huang L.H. Qureshi S.A. Cowburn D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1994; 76: 821-828Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Therefore, differential DNA binding activities of Stat proteins could be explained by differences in two distinct equilibrium processes (Fig. 1 B): formation and dissociation of dimers (K1), and formation and dissociation of Stat dimer-DNA complexes (K2). To begin to understand the mechanism underlying the differences in DNA binding activity between Stat3α and -3β homodimers, we first examined the relative rates of formation and dissociation of Stat3α- and 3β-hSIE complexes (Fig. 2). Stat3α and -3β were used at concentrations that gave similar hSIE-binding activities (25 and 1 ng, respectively, see Fig. 1); for each isoform the amount chosen was in the linear range of binding activity. To monitor association rates, Stat protein was incubated with labeled hSIE oligonucleotide and reaction aliquots were loaded onto a pre-running gel at various time points during the incubation (Fig.2 A). At the concentrations used, the two isoforms associated with DNA at very similar initial rates. We should note that the association of Stat protein with the hSIE is initially rapid and then continues at slower rate (Fig. 2 A). A plausible interpretation of this observation is that the rapid phase of the association curve reflects the association of complexes between preformed dimer and oligonucleotide, whereas the slower phase represents the binding of dimers formed from monomers (Fig. 2). If this interpretation is correct, the formation of dimers from monomers is considerably slower than the association of dimer with DNA. The measurement of dissociation rate was assessed by the addition of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled hSIE to the preformed complex of Stat/hSIE and aliquots were removed at various times for gel analysis (Fig. 2 B). As seen in Fig. 2 B, the rates of dissociation of the Stat3α- and 3β-hSIE complexes were essentially identical (t 12 of 13 and 12 min, respectively). In preliminary experiments not presented, when lower levels of competitor were used no appreciable differences in the dissociation rates of Stat3α and -3β were observed although a longer incubation time was neccessary for them to dissociate from the DNA. These results lead to the conclusion that Stat3α and -3β have similar binding strength, excluding the possibility that differential DNA binding activity results from differential binding affinity for DNA. Reagents that react with the SH2 domain or phosphotyrosine 705 of Stat3α and -3β should act as competitive inhibitors of dimerization and thereby cause dimer dissociation. To compare the effect of such competitors on the two Stat isoforms, we used three different reagents: an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3 A); the purified SH2 domain of Stat1 (Fig. 3 B), which was more effective than the SH2 domain of Stat3 (data not shown); and a synthetic phosphopeptide corresponding to the phosphotyrosine 705 motif of Stat3 (Fig. 3 C). Each reagent was incubated with Stat3α or -3β at various molar ratios and residual dimer was assessed by measuring DNA binding activity. With Stat3α there was a marked drop in DNA binding as the ratio of competitor increased. On a molar basis, the SH2 domain was a more active competitor than the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody or phosphopeptide. However, Stat3β showed little or no change in oligonucleotide binding activity even at molar ratios that almost completely abolished the binding activity of Stat3α. Only at much higher ratios of competitor to Stat3β was there a noticeable effect of the competitors (Fig. 3 D). Whereas phosphopeptide corresponding to the tyrosine 705 motif was effective, a nonphosphorylated version of the peptide had little or no effect (Fig. 3, C and D), demonstrating the specificity of the competitive effect, as anticipated for an interaction with the SH2 domain. We also observed that the dissociation of Stat3α dimer by the addition of competitors reached equilibrium within 15 min, during the incubation time of competition assay, whereas dissociation of Stat3β dimer occurred slowly, taking about 1 h for equilibrium (data not shown). Taken together, these results lead to the conclusion that Stat3β dimers are more stable than Stat3α dimers and that the difference in dimer stability is at least partly responsible for differential DNA binding activity. Stat3α and -3β differ only in their C-terminal sequence, the 55 terminal amino acid residues of Stat3α (containing 8 acidic residues) replaced by 7 residues specific to Stat3β (depicted as a cartoon in Fig.4). They are otherwise identical, including domains involved in DNA binding and dimerization (SH2 and Tyr-705). Therefore, differences in DNA binding activity and dimer stability of Stat3α and -3β could be due to the presence of the C-terminal sequence of Stat3α and/or the presence of the specific C-terminal residues of Stat3β. To examine this, we prepared mutant proteins with serial deletions (Δ12, Δ19, Δ33, Δ40, Δ48, and Δ55) in the Stat3α C-terminal region. Δ48 mutant lacks most of the negatively charged C-terminal 48 amino acids of Stat3α (Fig. 4), resulting in a molecule with the same number of amino acid residues as Stat3β. Δ55 mutant ends at the amino acid residue where Stat3α and -3β diverge in sequence. We first compared the DNA binding activities by EMSA (Fig. 4), using equimolar concentrations of the tyrosine 705-phosphorylated forms of each Stat protein, as described in the figure legend. DNA binding activity per unit of phosphorylated protein increased with successive deletion of the C terminus. We next determined whether the increase in DNA binding activity correlated with an increase in dimer stability assessed by use of dimerization competitors as above. As shown in Fig. 5, all of the C-terminal deletion mutants tested showed reduced sensitivity to competitors compared with Stat3α, Δ33, Δ48, and Δ55 being approximately equivalent to Stat3β. We conclude that the presence or absence of the C-terminal residues of Stat3α determines the differences in DNA binding activity and dimer stability between Stat3α and -3β.Figure 5Stat3α deletion mutants show enhanced dimer stability compared with Stat3α wild type. The competition assays were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. The amounts of proteins were as follows; Stat3α, 25 ng (12 nm); Δ19, 6 ng (3 nm); Δ33, 3 ng (1.5 nm); Δ48, 1 ng (0.5 nm); Δ55, 1.5 ng (0.75 nm); Stat3β, 1 ng (0.5 nm). The molar ratios of (Competitor)/(Stat) were same as in Fig. 3; (SH2)/(Stat) were, 1.5 (lanes 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27), 7.5 (lanes 3, 8, 13, 18, 23,and 28), 30 (lanes 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, and29) and 90 (lanes 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and30); (α-pY Ab)/(Stat) were 0.6 (lanes 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27), 2.4 (lanes 3, 8, 13, 18, 23,and 28), 24 (lanes 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, and29), and 120 (lanes 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and30); (p-Peptide or Peptide)/(Stat) were 200 (lanes 2, 7, 12, 17, 22, and 27), 800 (lanes 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, and 28), 2,000 (lanes 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, and 29), and 8,000 (lanes 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Expanding a previous study comparing thein vivo dimer stability of the two C-terminal deletion forms of Stat3α to that of Stat3α and -3β (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we next determined the stability of activated forms of the entire set of deletion mutants (Fig. 6). COS-7 cells transfected with each expression plasmid and stimulated with EGF were treated with PD157655, a specific inhibitor of EGF receptor kinase. Nuclear extracts were then prepared at various times and assessed for hSIE binding, total Stat3 protein, and tyrosine 705 phosphorylation. There was a good agreement between hSIE binding activity and tyrosine 705 phosphorylation state, and little change in total Stat3 proteins during the course of the experiment. Comparison of the decay of DNA binding activity and tyrosine 705 phosphorylation revealed a marked difference in stability of Stat3α and -3β; the half-life of active Stat3α was approximately 20 min (comparable to the 10 min seen in a previous report (5Park O.K. Schaefer T.S. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13704-13708Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar)) compared with 2 h or more for Stat3β. Similar to results obtained in vitro with recombinant proteins, the truncation of C-terminal tail enhanced the half-life of Stat3α. The half-lives of Δ40 and Δ48 deletion mutants were similar to that of Stat3β (≈2 h). The results suggest that the stability of tyrosine 705 phosphorylation accounts for the in vivo stability of activated Stat3 proteins and that the rate of dephosphorylation of tyrosine 705 is a function of dimer stability of Stat3 isoforms and is correlated with the DNA binding of the proteins. Stat3α and -3β are the alternatively spliced products of the same gene, differing only at their C termini. Despite the minor difference in primary sequence, we report here that there is a marked difference in the DNA binding activities of recombinant Stat3α and -3β in vitro (Fig. 1 A). This is consistent with a previous study that indicated DNA binding of Stat3β is significantly higher than Stat3α in COS-7 cells transfected with expression plasmids (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we sought to understand these differences by individually examining the binding processes shown in Fig. 1 B. We conclude that the differences in DNA binding activity between the Stat3 isoforms are determined by dimer stability (K1) but not by differential DNA binding strength (K2) (Figs. 2 and 3). Another important finding was that the deletions in the C terminus of Stat3α enhanced both DNA binding activity and dimer stability of Stat3α (Figs. 4 and 5). This indicates that the C-terminal region unique to Stat3α exerts a negative effect on dimer stability and, concomitantly, its DNA binding activity. Although it has yet to be determined how the C-terminal region of Stat3α plays an inhibitory role, one notable characteristic of C-terminal 55 amino acids is net negative charge (8 Asp and Gluversus 1 Arg; net charged −7). In fact, the estimated isoelectric points of Stat3α and -3β are 5.9 and 6.5, respectively. Consistent with this, a Stat3α-hSIE oligonucleotide complex migrates faster than Stat3β-hSIE complex in electrophoretic mobility shift experiments using native gels. Moreover, Stat3α mutant proteins with progressive C-terminal deletions displayed a proportional decrease in mobility in EMSA experiments, indicating the decrease of net-negative charge (Fig. 5). Although it is conceivable that the negatively charged C-terminal region of Stat3α mediates an interaction with and therefore masks its own dimerization domain, the addition of a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal 55 amino acids of Stat3α did not result in the dissociation of DNA-bound Stat3α dimers (data not shown). Alternatively, electrostatic repulsion or a particular structure adopted by the C-terminal segment of Stat3α might be unfavorable for dimer formation. Additional mutational and structural analyses on the C terminus are needed to address this possibility. We observed a good correlation between in vitro and in vivo dimer stability of both Stat3 wild type and deletion mutants. Results obtained with recombinant proteins in vitro that demonstrated an increase in DNA binding by C-terminal truncations were consistent with those observed previously in vivo with Stat3 (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Schaefer L.K. Wang S. Schaefer T.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and similar mutations of Stat5 (16Wang D. Stravopodis D. Teglund S. Kitazawa J. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6141-6148Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Assuming that the same phosphatase is responsible for dephosphorylating tyrosine 705 of Stat3α and -3β, the C-terminal sequence of Stat3α may provide for a more favorable association with the phosphatase. Another possibility, due to the strong dimers formed by Stat3β, tyrosine 705 of Stat3β may not be readily accessible to the phosphatase, in contrast to Stat3α. It has been reported that there are naturally occurring short forms of Stat5α and -5β, and that the carboxyl-truncated Stat5 short forms are more stably tyrosine-phosphorylated than wild type Stat5 in transfected cells (17Moriggl R. Gouilleux-Gruart V. Jahne R. Berchtold S. Gartmann C. Liu X. Hennighausen L. Sotiropoulos A. Groner B. Gouilleux F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5691-5700Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We found similar results with Stat3 truncations assessing the EGF-induced DNA binding in the presence of an EGF kinase inhibitor (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stat3β and the shorter deletion forms of Stat3α retained DNA binding activity (and phosphorylation of tyrosine 705) much longer than Stat3α. These results imply that differential dimer stability may be a general property shared by pairs of Stat isoforms. Stat3α and -3β differ in other properties. In transfected culture cells, Stat3β transcriptionally cooperates with c-Jun in the activation of an interleukin 6-responsive promoter that also contains a proximal AP-1 (c-Jun)-binding site, whereas Stat3α shows only an additive effect (18Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 25Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) despite directly interacting with two regions common to both proteins (25Zhang X. Wrzeszczynska M.H. Horvath C.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7138-7146Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Another striking difference in transfected cells is that only Stat3β can constitutively bind DNA and activate transcription from promoters in the absence of added extracellular cytokines or growth factors (18Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9097-9101Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). It remains to be determined if these properties are also attributable to the difference in dimer stability of the two isoforms. Stat3β seems to play dual roles, depending on the promoter. There are also reports that Stat3β can function as a dominant negative regulator on certain promoters (26Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A.M. Lammers J.W.J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 105-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1455) Google Scholar) although the precise mechanism is not known. Our results presented here suggest that this could occur by the occupancy of Stat3-binding sites in promoters by the much more stable Stat3β homodimers. We have shown that despite having a higher dimerization potential than Stat3α, Stat3β transcriptional activity is relatively weak (19Schaefer T.S. Sanders L.K. Park O.K. Nathans D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5307-5316Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), compared with Stat3α. Stat3β expression level is low compared with Stat3α in many cell lines and tissues. 2L. K. Schaefer and T. S. Schaefer, unpublished observations. The unique properties of Stat3β such as constitutive activation and delayed dephosphorylation might have physiological significance when the expression level of Stat3β is elevated (e.g. Stat3β mRNA is produced as a major spliced form). Proteins immunologically related to Stat3 are constitutively activated in cells transformed by the v-Src oncoprotein (28Yu C.L. Meyer D.J. Campbell G.S. Larner A.C. Carter-Su C. Schwartz J. Jove R. Science. 1995; 269: 81-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (824) Google Scholar). Subsequent studies have shown that Stat3α is required for v-Src-mediated transformation (29Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D.

Thus, the notion that genes activated by Stat3α play a role in aberrant cell growth and preventing programmed cell death makes this protein a reasonable target for molecules designed to interfere with dimerization/DNA binding.

https://openalex.org/W2093316814,"A site-directed mutagenesis, D244E, ofS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase) changes drastically the nature of the protein, especially the NAD+binding affinity. The mutant enzyme contained NADH rather than NAD+ (Gomi, T., Takata, Y., Date, T., Fujioka, M., Aksamit, R. R., Backlund, P. S., and Cantoni, G. L. (1990)J. Biol. Chem. 265, 16102–16107). In contrast to the site-directed mutagenesis study, the crystal structures of human and rat AdoHcyase recently determined have shown that the carboxyl group of Asp-244 points in a direction opposite to the bound NAD molecule and does not participate in any hydrogen bonds with the NAD molecule. To explain the discrepancy between the mutagenesis study and the x-ray studies, we have determined the crystal structure of the recombinant rat-liver D244E mutant enzyme to 2.8-Å resolution. The D244E mutation changes the enzyme structure from the open to the closed conformation by means of a ∼17° rotation of the individual catalytic domains around the molecular hinge sections. The D244E mutation shifts the catalytic reaction from a reversible to an irreversible fashion. The large affinity difference between NAD+ and NADH is mainly due to the enzyme conformation, but not to the binding-site geometry; an NAD+ in the open conformation is readily released from the enzyme, whereas an NADH in the closed conformation is trapped and cannot leave the enzyme.

S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase adenosine S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine l-homocysteine S-adenosyl-l-methionine NAD+or NADH adenosine-like intermediate (probably 3′-ketoadenosine) wild-type enzyme poly(ethylene glycol) root-mean-square deviation S-Adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (AdoHcyase,1 EC 3.3.1.1) catalyzes the hydrolysis of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) to form adenosine (Ado) and homocysteine (Hcy). The reaction is reversible, and the equilibrium lies far in the direction of AdoHcy synthesis. Under physiological conditions, however, the removal of both Ado and Hcy is sufficiently rapid, so that the net reaction proceeds in the direction of hydrolysis (1Richards H.H. Chiang P.K. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 4476-4480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ado is removed by Ado deaminase and Ado kinase, and Hcy is used for the synthesis of cysteine and the regeneration of methionine. In mammals, Hcy is produced solely from AdoHcy, and it was reported recently that an elevated plasma Hcy level is one of the risk factors for coronary heart disease (2Nygard O. Nordrehaug J.E.

Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mechanism of reversible hydrolysis of AdoHcy catalyzed by AdoHcyase has been studied by Palmer and Abeles (6Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5817-5819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Palmer J.L. Abeles R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1217-1226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who showed that AdoHcy and Ado are first oxidized to 3′-keto derivatives by the enzyme-bound NAD+. This facilitates abstraction of the 4′-proton by an enzyme base, and the resulting carbanion eliminates the 5′-substituent, Hcy or water, to yield 3′-keto-4′,5′-dehydroadenosine. Michael-type addition of water or Hcy to this central intermediate, and reduction of 3′-keto by the NADH formed results in the formation of the final product, Ado or AdoHcy. From an analysis of amino acid sequence of rat liver AdoHcyase, Ogawa et al. (5Ogawa H. Gomi T. Mueckler M.M. Fujioka M. Backlund P.S. Aksamit R.R. Unson C.G. Cantoni G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

To examine whether this region is indeed part of the NAD+-binding domain of AdoHcyase, Gomi et al. (8Gomi T. Date T. Ogawa H. Fujioka M. Aksamit R.R. Backlund Jr., P.S. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16138-16142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have converted each of the glycines at positions 219, 221, and 224 of rat liver AdoHcyase to a valine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant enzymes obtained do not bind NAD+, are catalytically inactive, and are found to exist as monomers. These results suggest that the region of residues 213–244 is the NAD+-binding site of rat liver AdoHcyase. To further probe the NAD+-binding site of AdoHcyase, Gomi et al. (9Gomi T. Takata Y. Date T.

The mutant enzyme contained only 0.05 mol of NAD+ but contained ∼0.6 mol each of NADH and adenine/mol of subunit. In the presence of a saturating concentration of NAD+, the mutant enzyme showed apparent K m values for substrates similar to those of the WT enzyme. Moderate decreases of 8- and 15-fold were observed inV max values for the synthetic and hydrolytic directions, respectively. From the appearance of activity as a function of NAD+ concentration, the enzyme was shown to bind NAD+ with a K d of 23 μm(83 nm for WT) at 25 °C. These results were considered to suggest the importance of Asp-244 in binding NAD, consistent with the idea that the region of AdoHcyase from residues 213 to 244 is part of the NAD binding site (9Gomi T.

An NAD molecule lies in the cleft of the NAD-binding domain of each subunit and is connected to the protein by both polar and non-polar interactions. The adenosine moiety of the bound NAD is further covered by the C-terminal domain of the adjacent subunit. Lys-425 and Tyr-429 of the adjacent subunit participate in hydrogen bonding with adenosine ribose and pyrophosphate of NAD, respectively (10Turner M.A. Yuan C.S. Borchardt R.T. Hershfield M.S.

In contrast to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, the crystal structures of AdoHcyase have shown that the carboxyl group of Asp-244 points in a direction opposite to the bound NAD molecule and does not participate in any hydrogen bonds with the NAD molecule, although Asp-244 is positioned near the NAD molecule (10Turner M.A. Yuan C.S.

To explain the discrepancy between the mutagenesis studies and the x-ray studies, we have determined the crystal structure of the D244E mutant enzyme. The D244E mutant structure indicates that the original D244E data open to an alternative interpretation, but it also illuminates several important features of the catalytic mechanism of AdoHcyase. Escherichia coli JM109 harboring the mutant plasmid encoding the Asp-244 to Glu mutation (D244E) was used to obtain the mutant enzyme (9Gomi T. Takata Y. Date T. Fujioka M. Aksamit R.R. Backlund Jr., P.S. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16102-16107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme was purified to homogeneity fromE. coli extracts by gel filtration over Sephacryl S-300 and DEAE-cellulose chromatography as described previously (9Gomi T. Takata Y. Date T. Fujioka M. Aksamit R.R. Backlund Jr., P.S. Cantoni G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16102-16107Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method was employed for crystallization of the enzyme. All crystallization experiments were conducted at 22 °C. Small crystals of the enzyme were grown for 1 week in a solution containing 22% (w/v) PEG 4000, 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and 10% (v/v) isopropanol with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The small crystals were put as seeds in a fresh solution containing 15% (w/v) PEG 4000, 50 mmTris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, 2% (v/v) glycerol, 5% (v/v) isopropanol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The plate-shaped crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction (∼0.3 mm × 0.2 mm × 0.1 mm) were grown for 3 days. Note that any substrate/cofactors were not added in the crystallization solution. The crystals of D244E were washed with 30% PEG 4000 solution, and were dissolved in Tris/HCl buffer. The protein was denatured by adding 2 volumes of absolute ethanol. The precipitate was washed once with 70% ethanol, and the combined supernatants were dried in vacuo. The residue was dissolved in 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and analyzed by HPLC on a column of C18 (1.0 × 30 cm), using a gradient between 100 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.2, and the same solution containing 15% acetonitrile. The flow rate was 2 ml/min. The effluent was monitored by absorbance at 260 nm. Three significant peaks were observed at 9.0, 9.8, and 11.9 min, respectively. The peaks corresponded to NADH, Ade, and Ado, respectively. The peak area indicated the ratio of NADH:Ade:Ado to be about 3:1:2. The crystals in a hanging drop were scooped by a nylon loop and were dipped into a cryoprotectant solution containing 30% ethylene glycol, 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.2, and 15% (w/v) PEG 4000 for 30 s before they were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen crystals were transferred onto a Rigaku RAXIS IIc imaging plate x-ray diffractometer with a rotating anode x-ray generator as an x-ray source (CuKα radiation operated at 50 kV and 100 mA). The diffraction data were measured up to 2.8-Å resolution at -180 °C. The data were processed with the program DENZO (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The crystal structure was determined by a molecular replacement procedure using X-PLOR. The structure of the rat liver WT enzyme (open conformation) and the structure of the human placental enzyme (closed conformation) were used as search models. The closed structure model gave significantly better PC refinement results than the open structure model. At this stage, the open structure model was abandoned. The crystal structure was refined by a standard refinement procedure in the X-PLOR protocol (13Brünger A.T. X-PLOR 3.1: A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven1993Google Scholar). During the later stages of refinement, difference maps (Fo − Fc maps) showed a large significant residual electron density peak in the region of active site. The shape of the electron density peak suggested that the individual subunit contains an Ado or Ado* rather than adenine itself. Four Ado molecules were placed into the electron density peaks in the four subunits. Refinement of isotropic temperature factors for individual atoms was carried out by the individual B-factor refinement procedure of X-PLOR using bond and angle restraints. The temperature factors of NAD and Ado were significantly higher than those of the atoms surrounding the NAD and Ado. Thus, the temperature factors were re-refined with different occupancy factors (0.75, 0.5, and 0.25) of NAD and Ado. Since the occupancy factors, 0.50, of NAD and Ado gave the lowest R-factor as well as reasonable temperature factors of NAD and Ado, the occupancy factors of NAD and Ado were set to 0.5. Although 3′-ketoadenosine molecules were placed in the active sites instead of Ado molecules and the crystal structure was refined, no significant changes were observed in the refinement parameters. During the final refinement stage, well defined residual electron density peaks in difference maps were assigned to water molecules if peaks were able to bind the protein molecules with hydrogen bonds. The final crystallographic R-factor is 0.197 for all data (no ς cut-off) from 8.0- to 2.8-Å resolution. The free R for randomly selected 5% data is 0.248 (14Brünger A.T. Nature. 1992; 255: 472-474Crossref Scopus (3864) Google Scholar). There are three known AdoHcyase structures (human placenta, rat liver, and D244E mutant enzyme). In order to compare the structures, the individual structures were divided into three domains. At first, the catalytic and NAD binding are approximately defined as follows: catalytic domain, residues 4–175 and 360–385; NAD-binding domain, residues 200–350. The two domains of WT were individually aligned on those of D244E by a least-squares method. The Cα-Cα distances between the two structures were plotted against residue numbers. The two plotted curves of the catalytic domain and NAD-binding domain across each other around residue numbers 183–184, 356–357, and 390–391. From the plot, the catalytic, NAD-binding, and C-terminal domains are defined as follows: catalytic domain, residues 4–183 and 357–390; NAD-binding domain, residues 184–356; C-terminal domain, residues 391–431. The r.m.s.d. listed in Table II were calculated based on the above domain assignment.Table IIThe root-mean-square deviations (Å) between two structuresSection superimposed 2-aThe catalytic domain, NAD-binding domain and C-terminal domain are defined as: catalytic domain, residues 2–183 and 357–390; NAD-binding domain: residues 184–356; C-terminal domain: residues 391–431.No. of Cαatoms usedRat liver D244E vs. rat liver WTHuman placenta vs. rat liver WTRat liver D244E vs.human placentaCatalytic domain2160.600.680.39NAD-binding domain1730.530.550.33C-terminal domain411.110.351.03NAD-binding domain and C-terminal domain2140.810.610.64One subunit4302.962.860.604 (NAD-binding domains)6920.650.670.414 (NAD-binding domains and C-terminal domains)8560.840.640.674 subunits17204.504.210.76After rotating the catalytic domains by16.9°17.1°1.6°One subunit4300.730.630.534 subunits17200.730.640.552-a The catalytic domain, NAD-binding domain and C-terminal domain are defined as: catalytic domain, residues 2–183 and 357–390; NAD-binding domain: residues 184–356; C-terminal domain: residues 391–431. Open table in a new tab The crystallographic refinement parameters (Table I), final (2Fo − Fc ) maps and conformational analysis by PROCHECK (15Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) indicate that the crystal structure of D244E has been successfully determined. The mutant enzyme consists of four subunits related by a pseudo-222 symmetry (Fig. 1). The four subunits are denoted subunits A, B, C, and D. Although the four subunits are crystallographically independent, the subunits are structurally very similar. The r.m.s.d. of the Cα among the subunit structures related by a pseudo 222-fold symmetry is less than 0.38 Å. For simplicity, therefore, the following description mainly refers to one subunit (A). When subunit-subunit interactions are referred to, subunits A and B are described. The subunit is composed of three domains with the peptide chain organized into 17 α helices and 15 β strands. The three domains are denoted the catalytic domain (residues 1–183 and 357–390; topology: α0-α1-β1-α2-β2-α3-β3-α4-β4-α5-β5-α6-β6 and α14-β15), the NAD-binding domain (residues: 184–356; topology: α7-β7-α8-β8-α9-β9-α10-β10-α11-β11-α12-β12-β13-β14-α13), and the C-terminal domain (residues 391–431; topology: α15-α16). The catalytic and NAD-binding domains are each folded into an ellipsoid with a typical α/β twisted open-sheet structure. The two domains are connected at the ellipsoidal pole sections by a reciprocal penetration of a pair of relatively long α-helices. Consequently, the subunit is a “fat U” in shape (Fig.2). In contrast to the structure of WT enzyme (open conformation), a cleft between the catalytic domain and the NAD-binding domain is closed, indicating that the D244E mutant enzyme adopts a closed conformation. The small C-terminal domain, composed of (random coil)-(two-turn α-helix)-(random coil), is separated from the main body of the subunit and penetrates into the adjacent subunit B. The C-terminal domain is tightly connected to the NAD-binding domain of subunit B by both polar and non-polar interactions, and participates in forming the NAD-binding site of subunit B (Fig. 2). In the tetrameric organization, the four NAD-binding domains are located near the center of the tetramer, and are tightly connected to each other by both polar and non-polar interactions. Formation of the tetramer creates a unique channel structure (∼10 × 10 × 50 Å) that passes through the center of tetramer. The polar C-terminal ends go into the channel. The catalytic domains are placed far from the center of the tetramer and, therefore, interact little with each other. An NADH molecule lies in a crevice between the tips of β7 and β10 with the pyrophosphate group straddling the β sheet and the two ends on the opposite sides of the β sheet. The NADH molecule is held by hydrophobic interactions and by hydrogen bonds (Fig. 3). The nicotinamide moiety of NADH is positioned near the bottom of the fat U and faces the β strands of the catalytic domain. An Ado molecule or Ado* is found in the active site of the catalytic domain (Fig. 4). The ribose moiety of Ado lies in a crevice between the tips of β1 and β4, and the adenine ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket located in the catalytic domain. The Ado is connected by hydrogen bonds not only to the catalytic domain, but also to the NAD-binding domain (Fig.5). The ribose ring is approximately parallel to the nicotinamide ring of NADH. The distance between the C3′ of Ado and the C4 of NADH is 3.3 Å (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the H3′ can be directly transferred between the C3′ of Ado and the C4 of NAD+ with only minor structural adjustments. The details of hydrogen-bond networks are given in Fig.6.Figure 5The Ado-binding sites observed in the WT structure (A) and the D244E structure (B). It is noted that the WT structure has a well developed substrate binding site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Figure 6Schematic diagrams of interactions of NADH and Ado* in the active site of the D244E structure. The possible hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The temperature factors of the bound NADH and Ado were relatively high in comparison to those of the surrounding protein atoms, indicating that the NADH and Ado molecules do not fully occupy the sites. A simple analysis between the temperature factor and the occupancy factor indicated that D244E contains ∼0.5 mol of each NADH and Ado/mol of subunit. The D244E mutation shifts the enzyme conformation from open to closed. However, as summarized in Table II, there is no significant structural difference among the catalytic domains and the NAD-binding domains of the three known crystal structures of AdoHcyase (rat liver WT enzyme, human placenta enzyme, and D244E mutant enzyme). The small C-terminal domains (residues 390–431) of the rat WT and human enzymes are quite similar to each other (r.m.s.d. = 0.33 Å), whereas the C-terminal domain of the D244E mutant is different from those of the WT enzyme and the human enzyme (r.m.s.d. = 1.11 and 1.03 Å). An especially significant difference is seen around residues 420–427 (Fig. 7). Thus, the D244E mutation in the NAD-binding domain produces its effects in the structure of the C-terminal domain rather than in the structure of the NAD-binding domain. The electron density of residues 420–427 is relatively weak, indicating that these amino acid residues are disordered. The disordering of the amino acid residues is apparently caused by the D244E mutation, since no such disordering is observed in the WT structure. The carboxylic group of Glu-244 apparently expels Phe-424B and Lys-425B of subunit B from their original sites. Consequently, Phe-424 and Lys-425 and several amino acid residues connected to them are disordered. A hydrogen bond between Lys-425B and the phosphate of NAD+ observed in the structure of WT enzyme is not seen in the D244E structure. The structural changes by the D244E mutation is summarized in Fig.8.Figure 8Summary of D244E mutation effects on the enzyme structure. A, WT and human enzymes;B, D244E mutant enzyme. Possible hydrogen bonds are indicated by dashed lines. Upon the mutation, the C-terminal domain of subunit B changes the conformation and the catalytic domain moved from the open to the closed site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The structures of the D244E and human placental enzyme complexed with 2′-hydroxy-3′-ketocyclopent-4′-enyladenine (10Turner M.A. Yuan C.S. Borchardt R.T. Hershfield M.S. Smith G.D. Howell P.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 369-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) have a closed conformation, whereas the structure of the substrate-free rat-liver WT enzyme (11Hu Y. Komoto J. Huang Y. Gomi T. Ogawa H. Takata Y. Fujioka M. Takusagawa F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8323-8333Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) has an open conformation (Fig.9). However, the tetrameric cores composed of the four NAD-binding domains of the D244E structure (closed conformation), the WT structure (open conformation), and the human placenta structure (closed conformation) are quite similar to each other (Table II). Although the four small C-terminal domains are separated from the main body of the subunit, they are tightly bound to the NAD-binding domain of the adjacent subunit. Even when the four C-terminal domains are included with the tetrameric core formation, the structures of the three AdoHcyases remain quite similar to each other. These observations indicate that the open-closed conformational changes in AdoHcyase are mainly due to movement of the relatively rigid individual catalytic domains. A rigid body analysis indicates three possible hinge sections (residues 183–184, 356–357, and 390–391) between the catalytic domain and the NAD-binding domain or the C-terminal domain. These hinges are located in the α-helix sections (α7, α14, α15) rather than the loop sections, and form approximately a straight line. A simple analysis indicates that the individual catalytic domain rotates by 16.9° around an axis passing through the molecular hinges (Fig. 9). After rotating the four catalytic domains of the WT structure by 16.9°, the r.m.s.d. between the WT and D244E structures is reduced to 0.73 Å from 4.50 Å. The rotation of the catalytic domain brings the bound substrate/inhibitor to the bound NAD+ into proximity so that the substrate/inhibitor can be oxidized by the bound NAD+. In the D244E structure, the distance between the C3′ of Ado and the nicotinamide C4 of NADH is 3.3 Å, and the C3′-H3′ is pointed toward the C4 (H3′ … C4 = 2.3 Å), indicating that a direct hydride transfer is possible. As shown in Fig. 5 A, the open structure observed in the substrate-free WT enzyme has a substrate/inhibitor binding site quite similar to that seen in the D244E closed structure. Thus, a substrate/inhibitor can readily enter or leave the substrate binding site when the enzyme adopts an open structure since there is a large cleft between the catalytic and NAD-binding domains (Fig. 2). On the other hand, a substrate/inhibitor cannot freely enter or leave when the enzyme adopts a closed structure since the cleft is closed. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the large cleft between the two domains is closed upon binding of substrate to bring NAD+ and substrate in proximity, and is opened upon completion of the catalytic reaction to release products. The open-closed mechanism is therefore an important aspect of AdoHcyase catalysis. It is necessary to define a probability that the wild-type enzyme and the D244E mutant enzyme purified with the procedures described under “Experimental Procedures” have an open conformation and a closed conformation, respectively. There are two pieces of evidence that support the open-closed conformational changes upon the D244E mutation. Those are as follows. 1) The"

The xenobiotic inducible forms with roles in the metabolism of carcinogens, pollutants, and drugs were thought to be exclusively associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (hereafter referred to as microsomes) of liver, brain, and other tissues. In contrast to this general belief, recent reports from our laboratory showed that the BNF-inducible P4501A1 and phenobarbital-inducible P4502B1 are also targeted to mitochondria under both in vitro and in vivo cell transfection conditions. These results are consistent with previous studies from our, as well as, other laboratories showing the presence of P450 proteins cross-reacting with antibodies to the major microsomal forms, in liver and brain mitochondria from inducer treated and untreated rats, and also insects (4Niranjan B.G.

Direct sequencing of hepatic mitochondrial P450 proteins purified from BNF-treated rats suggested the occurrence of two forms of P450MT2, both of which were NH2-terminal cleaved versions of P4501A1 (11Addya S.

The molecular form cleaved past the 4th amino acid residue (+5/1A1) represents a minor component while that cleaved past residue 32 (+33/1A1) represents the major component in mitochondria from BNF-treated rat liver.

The ERND activity of the mitochondrial targeted P4501A1 was further supported by experiments showing that mitochondrial P450MT2 rendered protection against erythromycin mediated inhibition of mitochondrial translation (15Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

Thus, the NH2-terminal truncated mitochondrial P450MT2 may be conformationally different from the microsomal P4501A1. We hypothesized that the NH2-terminal signals of a number of microsomal P450s, including 1A1, are chimeric in that they carry signals for targeting proteins to both the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. The chimeric nature of the amino-terminal 45-amino acid stretch of P4501A1 was further supported by the ability of this signal to target heterologous proteins such as the cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase and mature portion of rat P450c27 to endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria (16Bhagwat S.V.

Our studies on the mechanism of mitochondrial targeting of P4501A1 suggested the activation of a cryptic mitochondrial targeting signal at residues 33–44 by sequence specific cleavage past the 4th and 32nd residues of the protein by a cytosolic endoprotease (11Addya S.

In the present study, the sequence specificity of 1A1 chain cleavage by endoprotease and the generality of the mechanism of P450MT2 biogenesis was further tested by purifying and characterizing the 1A1-like P450 from BNF-treated rat brain mitochondria. Our results show that the brain mitochondrial P450MT2 is truncated at the same position as the major liver mitochondrial forms. Furthermore, under chronic BNF treatment conditions both in rat brain and cultured C6 glioma cells, the mitochondrial P450MT2 continues to accumulate and become a major part of the total 1A1 pool. The brain mitochondrial form exhibited highN-demethylation activity with a variety of antidepressant and anticonvulsant drugs suggesting a role in modulating the pharmacological potencies of neuroactive drugs. Maintenance of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (100–150 g, Harlan Sprague-Dawley Inc., Indianapolis, IN) received intraperitoneal administration of BNF (80 mg/kg body weight in corn oil) once daily for either 4 or 10 days, as described (4Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12495-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The control rats were administered with equivalent amounts of corn oil. Animals were killed 24 h after the last injection and overnight fasting by CO2 asphyxiation, and perfused transcardially with ice-cold saline. The livers and brains were rapidly removed, rinsed with saline excised in sucrose-mannitol buffer (2 mmHESES, pH 7.4, 70 mm sucrose, 220 mm mannitol, and 2 mm EDTA). Liver mitochondria were isolated as described (17Bhat N.K. Niranjan B.G. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Microsomes were isolated from the post-mitochondrial supernatant by centrifugation at 120,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Brain mitochondria were isolated using discontinuous Percoll density gradient banding as described by Sims (18Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were homogenized in 10 volumes of isolation medium containing 0.32 m sucrose, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT, and 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, and centrifuged at 1,300 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 10 min. The resultant pellet was resuspended in isolation medium and purified by banding through a discontinuous Percoll gradient. Mitochondria were suspended in sucrose/mannitol buffer (50 mg of protein/ml) and treated with digitonin (Wako Chemicals) at a final concentration of 75 μg/mg protein. The mitochondrial suspension was shaken on ice for 5 min, and the mitoplasts were pelleted by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min. The mitoplast pellet was washed 4 times with the sucrose/mannitol buffer, and used for further analysis. The purity of the mitochondrial preparation was checked routinely by assaying the marker enzyme activities and by immunoblot analysis as described before (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Raza H. Avadhani N.G. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 1999; 156: 231-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The purity of digitonin was found to be a critical factor in the yield as well as quantity of mitoplasts from brain tissue. In our hands, digitonin from Wako Chemicals yielded satisfactory results. The P450 content of mitoplasts was measured by the sodium dithionite-reduced carbon monoxide binding difference spectra (20Matsubara T. Koike M. Touchi A. Tochino Y. Sugeno K. Anal. Biochemistry. 1976; 76: 596-603Crossref Scopus (368) Google Scholar) in a buffer system containing 100 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol (v/v), 0.5% sodium cholate (w/v), and 0.4% Triton N-101 (v/v) for measuring the P450 content. Mitoplasts from 10-day BNF-treated rat brain were suspended in 100 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, at a final concentration of 20 mg of protein/ml and sonicated for 3 min (30 s pulse followed by 60 s of standing on ice) at setting 6 of a Branson sonifier. The P450 was solubilized by adding sodium cholate to a final concentration of 0.8% and fractionated with PEG as described previously (6Raza H. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9533-9541Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 0–15% PEG precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h and the pellet was suspended in 100 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4, containing 20% glycerol, 1.0 mm EDTA, 1.0 mm DTT, and 0.5% sodium cholate. The proteins were dissolved by homogenization with a glass homogenizer followed by stirring the suspension for 30 min at 4 °C. The solubilized protein fraction (10 mg of protein/ml) was subjected to ω-octylamine-agarose column chromatography as described before (7Addya S. Mullick J. Fang J-K. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 8Shayiq R.M. Addya S. Avadhani N.G. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 206: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The column was first washed until theA 280 of the eluant reached <0.05, and the protein bound to the column was eluted successively with 10 column volumes of buffer A containing 0.2 and 0.5% emulgen, respectively. Fractions rich in P450 (>0.1 Å at 417 nm) were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration through Amicon filters. The concentrated samples were dialyzed overnight against three changes of buffer B (10 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.7, 20% glycerol, 0.2% sodium cholate, and 0.2% emulgen), and subjected to further purification by Adx-Sepharose chromatography (12Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1150-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Coupling of purified Adx to Sepharose matrix was carried out as described by Honukoglu et al. (21Hanukoglu I. Spitsberg V. Bumpus J.A. Dus K.M. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4321-4328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, human recombinant Adx (0.1 μmol) was conjugated to 15 ml of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (7 ml bed volume) by incubating at 4 °C for 24 h. The P450 purified by ω-octylamine-agarose chromatography (10 mg/ml suspension of 40–60% purity) in 10 mmK2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% sodium cholate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm DTT (buffer C) was loaded on to Adx-Sepharose column (5 ml bed volume), pre-equilibrated with buffer C. The column was washed with 10 volumes of the same buffer and the bound proteins were eluted with a step gradient of 5 ml each containing 50, 100, 150, and 200 mmKCl in buffer C. The fractions were monitored for their absorbence at 417 nm. Rat glioma C6 cells were grown as described before (22Benda P. Lightbody J. Sato G. Levine L. Sweet W. Science. 1968; 161: 370-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar) in Ham's F-10 medium with 15% horse serum and 2.5% fetal bovine serum as described in the ATCC manual. BNF was dissolved in Me2SO and added in fresh medium alternate days for 4 days beginning from the 4th day of the passage. BNF in 0.1% Me2SO was added to a final concentration of 50 μm. Control plates were treated with an equivalent volume of 0.1% Me2SO alone. In chronic BNF treatment experiments, after 72 h of initial treatment, cells were replated and continuously exposed to BNF for up to 192 h. Cells were homogenized in 10 volumes of homogenization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and 0.25 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), with a Potter-Elvehjem Teflon-glass homogenizer. Microsomes and mitochondria were isolated by differential centrifugation as described (17Bhat N.K. Niranjan B.G. Avadhani N.G. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2452-2460Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were further purified on discontinuous Percoll density gradient as described earlier (18Sims N.R. J. Neurochem. 1990; 55: 698-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and washed twice with the homogenization buffer to eliminate contaminating Percoll and used for analysis. Proteins were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) or subjected to immunoblot analysis. In some experiments proteins were also subjected to high-resolution gradient (14–16%) SDS-polyacrylamide gels for resolving different P450MT2 forms as described (15Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

The conditions of protein blotting and immunodetection of protein bands were as described (15Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Bhagwat S.V. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) or intact P4501A1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) were used. The Adx-Sepharose affinity purified cytochrome P450 (∼100 pmol) was run on a gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gel (14–16%) and transblotted onto Sequi-blot polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The amino acid sequence of the two differently migrating protein components was determined by the phenylthiohydantion procedure in a Beckman LH 3600 gas-phase sequencer. TheN-demethylation of various substrates was measured by assaying the rate of formaldehyde formation (26Brian W.R. Sari M. Iwasaki M. Shimada T. Kaminisky L.S. Guengerich F.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 11280-11292Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 27Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). Reactions with mitoplasts and microsomes were run in a 500-μl final volume in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20 mmMgCl2, 200 μg of mitochondrial or microsomal protein, and 100 μm substrate. Purified Adx (0.1–0.2 nmol) + Adr (0.01–0.02 nmol) were added in some reactions with mitoplast preparations as indicated. Reconstitutions with purified P4501A1 and P450MT2 were carried out in dilaurylphosphatidyl choline vesicles (7Addya S. Mullick J. Fang J-K. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using the same buffer system described above for intact membranes. The final reaction volume was 200 μl, and contained 50 pmol of P450, 0.2 nmol of Adx, and 0.02 nmol of Adr or 0.1 nmol of P450 reductase and 100 μm substrate. After 3 min of preincubation at 37 °C the reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm NADPH and the reaction was continued at 37 °C for another 20 min in a shaking water bath. Reactions were terminated by adding 0.5 volume of ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10% w/v). The insolubles were pelleted by centrifugation at 10,000 × g at room temperature. An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of Nash reagent (250 μl or 100 μl) further incubated at 55 °C or 15 min. The reaction product, formaldehyde, was measured according to the method of Nash (27Nash T. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 416-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (4115) Google Scholar). A notable drawback of this assay is a generally high background value, which can be controlled by using freshly prepared Nash reagent and controlling the heating step during color development to 55 °C for 15 min. Typically, we obtainedA 412 values in the range of 0.01 to 0.014 for control tubes without added enzyme, and all significantN-demethylation activities reported here correspond to >3.5 fold of background reading. Rat C6 glioma cells were grown on coverslips and treated with BNF (50 μm) for 72 or 96 h and processed for antibody staining essentially as described before (11Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K.

After permeabilization with 0.1% Triton X-100, cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were double immunostained with 1:100 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody to P4501A1 and 1:50 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody to the mitochondrial genome encoded human COX I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as the mitochondrial-specific marker. Cells were washed repeatedly with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.0, and 150 mm NaCl), and incubated with fluorasceine 5-isothocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit donkey IgG for the detection of P4501A1 and Texas Red-conjugated anti-mouse donkey IgG for the detection of COX I protein. Incubation with both the secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were carried out for 1 h at 37 °C at 1:100 dilution. Unbound secondary antibodies were removed by repeated washing with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence microscopy was carried out under a TCS laser scanning microscope (Leica Inc.). 0.5-μm optical sections were scanned at thez axis with both fluoresceine 5-isothocyanate and Texas Red channels fully open to prevent any shifting or distortion of the images. Freshly isolated mitochondria and microsomes were subjected to trypsin digestion as described (10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Mitochondria and microsomes were suspended in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm DTT and subjected to trypsin digestion (30 μg of trypsin/mg protein) at room temperature for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding trypsin inhibitor (300 μg/mg protein) and an equal volume of 2 × Laemmli's sample buffer (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). The samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 5 min and loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel for immunoblot analysis. Extraction of mitochondrial and microsomal proteins with 0.1m Na2CO3 (pH 11), separation of soluble and insoluble protein fractions, and Western blot analysis were essentially as described (9Clark B.J. Waterman M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5898-5904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Addya S. Dwivedi R.S. Biswas G. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 339: 136-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), using freshly isolated mitochondria and microsomes. Except for the protease protection and alkaline extraction, in all other experiments digitonin-treated mitoplasts were used. The purity of rat brain mitochondrial preparations was routinely tested by immunoblot analysis for mitochondrial-specific COX I protein and microsome-specific P450 reductase. As shown in Fig. 1 (left panel), proteins solubilized from mitoplast preparations contained 39-kDa protein cross-reacting with antibody to COX I, while the microsomal fraction contained negligible COX I protein. As expected, the microsomal protein contained high levels of P450 reductase (Fig. 1,right panel), while the mitochondrial preparations contained negligible 78-kDa protein cross-reacting with antibody to P450 reductase. Although not shown, rat brain mitoplast preparations contained less than 2% microsome-specific marker enzyme, rotenone-insensitive NADPH cytochrome c reductase, but nearly 90% of cytochrome c oxidase activity. As previously shown (4Niranjan B.G. Wilson N.M. Jefcoate C.R. Avadhani N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12495-12501Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Addya S. Mullick J. Fang J-K. Avadhani N.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 82-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) the rat liver mitoplast preparations used in this study contained less than 1% microsomal contamination based on marker enzyme assays. To understand the possible functional significance of microsomal P4501A1 and mitochondrial P450MT2 in the rat liver and brain, we determined their relative abundance at moderate 4 days of BNF treatment, and chronic 10 days of BNF treatment. The immunoblot analysis of protein in Fig. 2 Ashows that the 1A1 antibody-reactive protein in the rat brain mitochondria increased steadily at 4 and 10 days of BNF treatment. The level of antibody-reactive protein in the brain microsomal fraction, on the other hand, was significantly reduced at 10 days of BNF treatment after reaching a peak at 4 days. As seen from Fig. 2 B, the induction pattern is nearly similar in the liver; the level increases steadily in the mitochondrial compartment, while that of the microsomal compartment peaks at 4 days of treatment followed by a significant reduction by 10 days of treatment. The total tissue levels (per gram basis) of mitochondrial and microsomal 1A1 antibody-reactive proteins in the liver and brain are presented in Fig. 2, C and D, respectively. These values were calculated based on the recovery of different organelles (mg of proteins)/g of tissue. Results show that the rate of accumulation of 1A1-like protein in mitochondria and microsomes follow different kinetic patterns. Interestingly both in the liver and brain, at 10 days of chronic BNF treatment, the mitochondrial P450MT2 preferentially accumulates to reach about 45–57% of the total tissue pools. The preferential increase of mitochondrial P450MT2 during chronic exposure to BNF was also investigated in C6 glioma cells, in which the expression of endogenous P4501A1 gene is induced in response to chemical inducers. Results of immunoblot analysis (Fig.3 A), and quantitation of subcellular contents of 1A1 antibody-reactive protein in Fig.3 B, show that similar to that seen with rat brain, the level of mitochondrial P450MT2 at 96 h of treatment was about 4-fold of that detected in microsomes. Additionally, at chronic 192 h of treatment, the mitochondrial P450MT2 represented over 95% of the total tissue pool, while the level of antibody reactive protein in the microsomal fraction was drastically reduced.Figure 1Purity of brain mitochondrial preparations.

A variety of cellular proteins have been shown to undergo high affinity association with Nck5a, including three novel proteins, C42, C48, and C53 found by a yeast two-hybrid screen (Ching, Y. P., Qi, Z., and Wang, J. H. (2000) Gene 242, 285–294). The three proteins show competitive binding to Nck5a suggesting that they bind at a common site. The binding site has been mapped to a region of 26 amino acid residues (residues 145 to 170) at the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain of Nck5a. This region of Nck5a contains an amphipathic α-helix whose hydrophobic face is involved in Cdk5 activation (Chin, K. T., Ohki, S, Tang, D., Cheng, H. C., Wang, J. H., and Zhang, M. (1999)J. Biol. Chem. 274, 7120–7127). Several lines of evidence suggest that Nck5a interacts with the binding proteins at the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic α-helix. First, the Nck5a-(145–170) peptide can bind Cdk5 and Nck5a-binding proteins simultaneously. Second, the association of Nck5a-(145–170) to C48 can be markedly reduced by high ionic strength whereas the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5 is not affected. Third, substitution of Glu157 by glutamine in Nck5a-(145–170) abolishes the peptide's ability to bind to the three Nck5a-binding proteins without diminishing its Cdk5 binding activity.

The regulatory subunit was subsequently shown to be a truncated form of a 35-kDa protein now known as neuronal Cdk5 activator, Nck5a (9Tsai L.-H. Delalle I. Caviness Jr., V.S. Chae T. Harlow E.

Cdk5 and its activators have been suggested to play important regulatory functions in mammalian brain development as well as neuronal activities in mature brains (12Nikolic M. Dudek H. Kwon Y.T.

Previously we reported the existence of three protein complex forms of Cdk5 in bovine brain: the monomeric Cdk5, a heterodimer of Cdk5 and p25Nck5a, and a 670-kDa macromolecular protein complex containing Cdk5 and p35Nck5a complex (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The three forms of Cdk5 have different kinase activities (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The monomeric Cdk5 has no endogenous kinase activity but can be activated by the addition of bacterial expressed Nck5a. While the heterodimer of Cdk5 and p25 nck5a displays high kinase activity, and the macromolecular protein complex containing Cdk5 and p35 nck5a has, surprisingly, no kinase activity, nor can it be activated by the addition of its activator (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This observation suggests that the proteolytic conversion of p35 nck5a to p25 nck5a may be a mechanism of Cdk5 regulation in neurons. This suggestion is supported by recent studies showing various biological and functional differences between the two forms of Nck5a such as, intracellular localization, protein turnover rate, and the ability to induce cell apoptosis (19Patrick G.N. Zukerberg L. Nikolic M. de la Monte S. Dikkes P. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1999; 402: 615-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (1320) Google Scholar). The fact that Cdk5-p25 nck5a exists as a heterodimer whereas Cdk5-p35 nck5a is part of a macromolecular protein complex suggests that Nck5a may show high affinity binding to specific cellular proteins (20Lee K.Y. Rosales J.L. Tang D. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1538-1543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Over last few years, several laboratories have reported the identification of specific Nck5a-binding proteins, including neurofilament proteins, retinoblastoma protein, a small GTPase Rac, and β-catenin (21Qi Z.

Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). We have used a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for Nck5a-binding proteins, resulting in the identification in a human brain library of 7 Nck5a-binding proteins, including three novel proteins. Full-length clones of these novel Nck5a-binding proteins, called C42, C48, and C53, have subsequently been isolated from a rat brain cDNA library (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Although Nck5a and Nck5ai activate a cyclin-dependent protein kinase, they do not appear to contain a cyclin box, a conserved region of the protein's primary structure characteristic of members of the cyclin protein family (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys.

On the other hand, D-type and E-type cyclins have been shown to bind to Cdk5, but the heterodimeric proteins have no observable kinase activity (4Xiong Y. Zhang H. Beach D. Cell. 1992; 71: 505-514Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar, 29Miyajima M. Nornes H.O. Neuman T. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 1130-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been suggested that the unique function and regulatory properties of Cdk5 arise, to a large extent, from the structure of Nck5a and Nck5ai. The present study is concerned mainly with the examination of the structural basis of the interactions between Nck5a- and Nck5a-binding proteins. We have found that the three novel Nck5a-binding proteins either share a common binding site or have overlapping binding sites. Using C48 as the model binding protein, a region of Nck5a spanning 26 amino acid residues, has been found to be the minimal sequence required for C48 binding. This region of Nck5a is proximal to the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). We have also characterized the interaction between Nck5a and C48 in detail. GST-fused forms of C48, C42, and C53 expression constructs used in this study were described previously (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Construction of GST-fused N-terminal and C-terminal deletion mutants of human p35 nck5a followed the procedures described in an earlier study (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To construct (His)6-tagged or GST-fused Nck5a-(145–170) bacterial expression plasmids, a PCR amplified,BamHI/EcoRI-digested fragment was inserted into the pET32a (Novagen) or pGEX4T-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), respectively. C48α1, C48α2, and C48α1–2 fragments amplified by PCR were digested with BamHI andEcoRI and subcloned into pGEX4T-2 expression vector for protein expression. Expression of GST- and histidine-tagged proteins and their purification from bacterial cells followed previously described methods (10Tang D. Yeung J. Lee K.-Y. Matsushita M. Matsui H. Tomizawa K. Hatase O. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26897-26903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 18Gilmore E.C. Ohshima T. Goffinet A.M. Kulkarni A.B. Herrup K. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 6370-6377Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An untagged form of Cdk5 was purified from a thrombin digestion mixture of GST-Cdk5 fusion protein. GST-Cdk5 (5 mg in 200 μl) was incubated with 15 units of thrombin in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 2.5 mmCaCl2 buffer at 4 °C for 3 h. The digestion mixture was then loaded onto a Superose-12 gel filtration chromatography column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with MTPBS buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mm Na2HPO4, 4 mm NaH2PO4, pH 7.3). The untagged Cdk5 was eluted with 40 ml of MTPBS buffer at a 0.5 ml/min flow rate. Western blot analysis with a Cdk5-specific antibody (C-8, Santa Cruz Biotech) was used to assay the presence of Cdk5 in each fraction. GST fusion proteins (30 μg) were incubated with 30 μl of GSH-agarose beads in 500 μl of binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 16 mmNa2HPO4, 4 mmNaH2PO4, pH 7.3, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). After incubation at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for 1 h, the beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer and subsequently resuspended in 500 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. About 15 μg of (His)6-tagged proteins were added to the above solution. After incubation at 4 °C with end-to-end rotation for an additional 30 min, the GSH-agarose beads were washed five times with 1 ml of 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The proteins precipitated by beads were then dissolved in 20 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer and resolved by 10% or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The precipitated histidine-tagged proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting using a p35 nck5a -specific antibody (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotech) or anti-His antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding competition assay followed the procedure described for the in vitrobinding assay except that specific competitor proteins were added together with the (His)6-tagged proteins. In vitro Cdk5 activity was assayed as described previously (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Two assay conditions were considered to evaluate the effect of the full-length C48 (or the α1 fragment) on Cdk5 activity. Under the first condition, GST-p25 nck5a and GST-Cdk5 was co-incubated together with the full-length GST-C48 protein or the GST-C48α1 fragment in the reconstitution step. Under the second condition, GST-p25 nck5a was preincubated with GST-C48 full-length protein or GST-C48α1 fragment for 30 min prior to the enzyme reconstitution. The site-directed substitution of Glu157 with a glutamine was performed using the QuickChange™ Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). A pair of complementary PCR primers were designed with the mutation in the middle of the primers. The sense primer was 5′-CGCTGCCTGGGTCAATTTCTCTGCCGCC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GGCGGCAGAGAAATTGACCCAGGCAGCG-3′. The wild type p25145–170 in pGEX4T-2 was used as the template for PCR amplification, and the mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The secondary structure of C48 was predicated by the program PHD (32Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2647) Google Scholar). One of the Nck5a-binding proteins, C48, was chosen as the model protein to study the molecular basis of interactions between Nck5a and its binding proteins. The C48 protein, upon expression inEscherichia coli as a GST fusion protein or a (His)6-tagged protein, can be readily purified from the bacterial cell lysate. The predicted secondary structure of C48 contains three α-helices (Fig.1 A). Since the last α-helix is not contained in the protein encoded by the C48 DNA fragment originally identified by the yeast two-hybrid screen (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this helix is likely not required for Nck5a binding. To further define the Nck5a-binding domain of C48, constructs containing each of the first two α-helix fragments, C48α1 and C48α2, as well as one containing both helixes (C48α1–2) were created and the GST fusion forms of these protein fragments were expressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein samples were then tested for their ability to bind to Nck5a. Data in Fig. 1 B show that (His)6-tagged p35 nck5a can bind to GST-C48α1, GST-C48α1–2 as well as the full-length C48, but not to GST-C48α2. This result suggests that the Nck5a-binding site is contained within the first α-helix of C48. To verify the above result, we examined the concentration-dependent binding between the two proteins. The amount of (His)6-tagged p35 nck5a found in the complex precipitated by GSH-agarose beads was shown to increase in parallel with the increasing amount of GST-C48α1 used in the binding assay (Fig. 1C). To map the C48-binding site of Nck5a, a series of N-terminal and C-terminal trunction mutants of Nck5a were constructed (Fig. 2 A). The mutant proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli and tested for their ability to bind to C48. Data in Fig.2 B show that extensive deletions from either N-terminal or C-terminal ends of Nck5a did not abolish its C48 binding activity. The observation that non-overlapping fragments of Nck5a (e.g.Nck5a-(1–173) and Nck5a-(214–292)) could bind to C48 suggests that there are two C48-binding sites in Nck5a. These two sites are designated here as the a-site and b-site and correspond to the binding sites close to either the N terminus or the C terminus of Nck5a, respectively. The smallest C48-binding fragment that contains the a-site is the 26-residue fragment of Nck5a-(145–170). The second site, b-site, appears to be localized to a region spanning residues Ser214 to Glu240, as both deletion mutants Nck5a-(187–240) and Nck5a-(214–292) show high binding affinity for C48 (Fig. 2).Figure 1Binding of C48 and its deletion mutants with p35 nck5a .

The existence of C48 in the GSH-agarose-precipitated protein complexes was detected with a monoclonal anti-His antibody. GSH-agarose beads and GST protein were used as the negative controls and GST-p25 nck5a was used as the positive control. C, the binding of p25145–170 and p25214–292 with (His)6-tagged C48α1.

The lane labeled “Input” represents the loading control of (His)6-tagged C48 protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although two C48-binding sites were identified in Nck5a using the deletion approach, it was not clear whether both sites are functional in the intact protein. To test this, we resorted to the use of truncation mutants of C48 that contain the Nck5a-binding site. We reasoned that by using a fragment of C48 with the regions not essential for binding eliminated, the possibility of nonspecific binding might be reduced. As C48α1 was the smallest Nck5a binding fragment of C48 available (Fig. 1 B), it was tested for binding to the two deletion mutants Nck5a-(145–170) and Nck5a-(214–292), which contain the N- and C-terminal C48-binding sites, respectively. Fig.2 C shows that only the deletion mutant containing the N-terminal binding site could bind C48α1, suggesting that the C-terminal-binding site does not operate in the intact Nck5a. In earlier studies, we showed that the region corresponding to the Nck5a-(145–170) peptide is required for Nck5a to activate Cdk5 (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 30Chin K.T. Ohki S. Tang D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7120-7127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The question of whether the binding of C48 will modulate the kinase activity of Cdk5/p25 nck5a therefore arises. To address this question, we tested the effect of C48 on Cdk5 kinase activity under two different conditions. Under one condition, Nck5a was preincubated with C48 prior to its mixing with Cdk5. Under the other condition, C48 was mixed with preactivated Cdk5·Nck5a complex to test its effect on kinase activity. Under both conditions, no change in Cdk5 activity was observed even when the concentration of C48 was increased to as high as 2 mg/ml (data not shown). These results suggest that Cdk5 and C48 do not compete with each other for binding to Nck5a. This observation is also in agreement with an earlier observation that C48 is capable of binding to both free Nck5a and Nck5a in association with Cdk5 (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We then examined whether the 26-residue minimal C48-binding peptide of Nck5a (Nck5a-(145–170)) can simultaneously interact with Cdk5 and C48. In these experiments, GST-fused C48 or C48α1 was incubated with both (His)6-tagged Nck5a-(145–170) and Cdk5, and the protein complexes were precipitated with GSH-agarose beads. The precipitates were then analyzed by Western blot for the existence of Nck5a-(145–170) and Cdk5. Since Cdk5 is capable of associating with Nck5a-(145–170) (Fig. 3 A) but not directly with C48 (Fig. 3 B), the equivalent amount of Cdk5 together with Nck5a-(145–170) in the C48 affinity precipitates indicates that Nck5a can simultaneously associate with Cdk5 and C48 to form a ternary complex. The observations that the minimal C48-binding peptide of Nck5a (Nck5a-(145–170)) can form a ternary complex with Cdk5 and C48 and that C48 protein does not effect the Nck5a-activated Cdk5 kinase activity suggest that C48 and Cdk5 react with different residues in this small peptide fragment. Structural studies has shown that this peptide fragment is likely to form an amphipathic α-helix (30Chin K.T. Ohki S. Tang D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7120-7127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that the two sides of the amphipathic α-helix may be used to bind to the two different proteins. The association between the Nck5a-(145–170) peptide and Cdk5 is mediated via hydrophobic interactions (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The binding to C48 is thus likely to involve the hydrophilic face of Nck5a-(145–170). Secondary structure prediction shows that the C48α1 peptide is also amphipathic (Fig.4). Therefore, we reasoned that the association between C48α1 and Nck5a-(145–170) is likely to be electrostatic in nature. Two different experiments were carried out to test the notion that the peptide Nck5a-(145–170) uses different faces of its amphipathic α-helix to associate with Cdk5 and C48. One of these examined the effect of salt and non-ionic detergent on the interaction of the peptide with the two proteins. As shown in Fig.5, the association between C48α1 and Nck5a-(145–170) decreased as the NaCl concentration was increased in the binding reaction buffer. The binding of C48α1 to the Nck5a peptide was essentially abolished when the salt concentration reached 1m (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, 1% Triton X-100 had no effect on the interaction between Nck5a-(145–170) and C48α1. In striking contrast to the C48-Nck5a interaction, the association between Nck5a and Cdk5 was not weakened by high concentrations of NaCl but was abolished completely by 1% Triton X-100 (Fig. 5 B). These results support the suggestion that, in the region spanning residues Gln145 to Ser170, Nck5a interacts with Cdk5 and C48 via the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of its amphipathic α-helix, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out as the second approach to test this hypothesis. The hydrophilic faces of the amphipathic α-helices of both Nck5a-(145–170) and C48α1 are rich in charged amino acid side chains (Ref. 30Chin K.T. Ohki S. Tang D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Zhang M. J.

Thus, it is possible that ionic interactions play important roles in the association between the two proteins, and mutations involving certain charged residues may therefore adversely effect this protein-protein interaction. Although attempts were made to produce mutations at two individual charged residues, only one mutant protein was successfully expressed inE. coli. Fig. 6 Ashows that substitution of Glu157 by glutamine abolished the ability of the peptide to bind to C48α1. Since Glu157is located at the center of the hydrophilic face of the α-helix, this result strongly implicates the hydrophilic face of the α-helix in the association between C48 and Nck5a-(145–170). In contrast, the association between the mutant peptide and Cdk5 was not adversely effected by this amino acid substitution (Fig. 6 B). In a previous study, we showed that a dual substitution mutant of Nck5a (where both Leu151 and Leu152 within the Nck5a-(145–170) region of the activator replaced by asparagines) lost most of its activity due to a severely diminished affinity for Cdk5 (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). This mutant protein was found to bind C48 as well as the wild type protein (results not shown). The differential effects of protein mutations on the interaction of Nck5a with Cdk5 and C48 have provided further support for the suggestion that the binding of Cdk5 and C48 to Nck5a-(145–170) involve the hydrophobic and hydrophilic faces of the amphipathic α-helix respectively. To test whether the C48-binding site of Nck5a is specific for C48, or shared by many of the Nck5a-binding proteins, we examined the interaction of Nck5a-(145–170) with C42 and C53, respectively. Fig. 7shows that both C42 and C53 bind to Nck5a as well as Nck5a-(145–170) with high affinities. This observation suggests that these three novel Nck5a-binding proteins share the same binding site on p35 nck5a . To further test this hypothesis, a competition assay was carried out between these p35 nck5a -associated proteins (C42 and C53) and C48. In this assay, GSH beads were first precoated with the competing Nck5a-binding protein (GST-C42 or GST-C53) and then incubated with a fixed amount of (His)6-tagged p25 nck5a and increasing amounts of (His)6-tagged C48. The samples were then affinity precipitated using GSH-agarose beads and the precipitates analyzed by Western blotting (see Fig.8 A). Fig. 8 A shows that as the amount of competing Nck5a-binding protein C48 was increased in the binding reaction, the amount of (His)6-tagged p25 nck5a in the affinity precipitates was reduced, consistent with a competitive binding between C48 and C42 or C53 for Nck5a. Similar results were obtained when C48α1, instead of the full-length C48, or Nck5a-(145–170) was used instead of p25 nck5a in the competitive binding assay (Fig. 8, B and C). These results further support the suggestion that both C42 and C53 compete with C48 for Nck5a binding at the site Nck5a-(145–170). The observation that C48α1, which binds selectively to thea-site, can effectively block the binding of C42 and C53 to p25 nck5a , strongly supports our view that site-bdoes not function as a binding site in intact Nck5a. Like C48, C42, and C53 bind strongly to Nck5a-(145–170). When the residue Glu157 was substituted with Gln, the binding activity of the peptide for these two proteins was mostly eliminated (Fig. 9). This result suggests that the mechanism used by C48, C42, and C53 to bind to Nck5a are similar (i.e. through the hydrophilic faces of the two α-helixes). This result further supports the model whereby these three proteins bind to the same region of Nck5a. During the last few years a variety of cellular proteins have been found that undergo specific and high affinity association with Nck5a (21Qi Z. Tang D. Zhu X. Fujita D.J. Wang J.H. J. Biol.

Characterizations of some of these protein-protein interactions have shed light on the function, regulation, and the mechanism of action of Nck5a (24Nikolic M. Chou M.M. Lu W. Mayer B.J. Tsai L.H. Nature. 1998; 395: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 31Moorthamer M. Zumstein-Mecker S. Chaudhuri B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, to date there is no study on the biochemical mechanisms of interactions between Nck5a and its binding proteins. The present study is concerned mainly with the molecular basis of the interactions between Nck5a and three novel Nck5a-binding proteins, designated C42, C48, and C53 (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Upon analyses of the binding characteristics of a large number of Nck5a deletion mutants, a region of 26 amino acid residues, proximal to the N-terminal boundary of the kinase activation domain of Nck5a, was identified as containing the binding site(s) of these Nck5a-binding proteins. The peptide corresponding to this region of Nck5a (designated as Nck5a-(145–170)) can associate with these Nck5a-binding proteins with affinities in the same order of magnitude as those of the full-length Nck5a. Interestingly, this region of Nck5a has also been suggested to contain structural elements essential for the kinase activation (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 27Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). This suggestion has been substantiated in the present study by the observation that Nck5a-(145–170) binds Cdk5 with high affinity. Due to its small size and relative ease of purification of the recombinant protein, C48 was used initially as the model Nck5a-binding protein in these studies. When full-length C48 was used to examine the binding properties of the various Nck5a deletion mutants, the results suggested the existence of two binding sites, one within the 26-residue region (a-site), and another in the region of residues 214–240 (b-site). Subsequently, the Nck5a-binding site was mapped to within the first α-helix of C48 and a C48 deletion mutant corresponding to this α-helix region, C48α1, could bind only to thea-binding site. This observation suggests that only thea-binding site can bind C48 in intact Nck5a. This suggestion was further supported by the observation that the binding of C53 and C42 to p25 nck5a can be effectively be blocked by both C48 and C48α1. It is a common practice to use deletion protein mutants to map specific binding sites on a protein molecule. The observation that binding site b demonstrated on deletion mutants may not function in the intact protein suggests caution against such artifacts. The three Nck5a-binding proteins (C42, C48, and C53) used in this study to characterize interactions between Nck5a and its binding proteins show common binding characteristics. They all display high affinity and specific binding to the peptide Nck5a-(145–170) and they compete with each other for bindings to the peptide or intact Nck5a, suggesting that they bind to Nck5a at a common site. The suggestion is further supported by the observation that the interactions of Nck5a with C42, C48, and C53 are similarly affected by the ionic strength and detergent contents of the reaction medium, as well as by site-directed mutation of Nck5a (see below). However, the possibility that C42, C48, and C53 have distinctive but overlapping sites in this region cannot be completely excluded. In an earlier study (30Chin K.T. Ohki S. Tang D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7120-7127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we showed that a 29-residue peptide derived from Nck5a displayed potent inhibitory activity toward Cdk5 and Cdk2. This Nck5a-derived inhibitor that spans residues Gln145 to Asp173 encompasses the amino acid residues of the peptide Nck5a-(145–170). Secondary structure prediction and analysis of the Cdk inhibitory peptide by circular dichroism and two-dimensional1H NMR spectroscopy have identified an amphipathic α-helix that spans amino acid residues Ser149 to Arg162 (30Chin K.T. Ohki S. Tang D. Cheng H.C. Wang J.H. Zhang M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7120-7127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). A number of amino acid side chains at the hydrophobic face of this amphipathic α-helix have been suggested to play important roles in the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5 (26Tang D. Chun A.C.S. Zhang M. Wang J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12318-12327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar,27Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Our observation that 1% Triton X-100 completely abolishes the binding of the peptide Nck5a-(145–170) to Cdk5 is consistent with this suggestion (Fig. 5 B). While the interaction between Cdk5 and Nck5a is dominated by hydrophobic interactions, several lines of evidence suggests that the hydrophilic face of the amphipathic α-helix plays a major role in the association of Nck5a with the Nck5a-binding proteins. First, Cdk5 and the Nck5a-binding proteins do not compete in their interactions with Nck5a-(145–170), and Nck5a-binding proteins can bind to both monomeric Nck5a and Nck5a in the heterodimer Cdk5/Nck5a (25Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene. 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that Nck5a uses distinct binding sites to interact with Nck5a-binding proteins and with Cdk5. Second, Nck5a-(145–170) loses its ability to associate with the Nck5a-binding proteins in high concentrations of NaCl, whereas the interaction between the peptide and Cdk5 is not adversely affected. On the other hand, while the interactions of the peptide with the Nck5a-binding proteins are totally refractory to the presence of 1% Triton X-100, the peptide-Cdk5 interaction is negated in the presence of the nonionic detergent. These results suggest that, in contrast to the Nck5a-Cdk5 interaction that depends on hydrophobic interactions, the association of Nck5a-binding proteins with Nck5a-(145–170) is dependent on electrostatic interactions. Lastly, substitution of a glutamate, Glu157, that is situated at the center of the hydrophilic face of the α-helix, by glutamine results in almost complete elimination of the interaction of Nck5a-(145–170) peptide with the Nck5a-binding proteins, without interfering with the binding of the peptide to Cdk5. On the other hand, substitution of two leucine residues, Leu151 and Leu152, in the hydrophobic face of the amphipathic α-helix by asparagines, previously shown to significantly decrease the interaction between Nck5a and Cdk5, has little effect on the association of Nck5a with the binding proteins. As the three Nck5a-binding proteins appear to bind at a common site on Nck5a, structural comparison of the three proteins may be expected to reveal a structural motif that is specific for the Nck5a-binding site. However, amino acid sequence alignments have failed to reveal such a structural motif. Perhaps the binding motif depends on structural features other than those in the primary structure. The smallest C48 fragment displaying high affinity binding to Nck5a, C48α1, contains an amphipathic α-helix. It is possible that the binding of C48 to Nck5a involves the hydrophilic face of this protein. Work is in progress to isolate the smallest Nck5a-binding fragments of the three binding proteins so as to define the binding motif. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 has many distinct functional and regulatory properties among members of Cdk family. It has been suggested that many of the distinct properties of Cdk5 arise from the unique structure of Nck5a. While all the other known activators of Cdks belong to the cyclin protein family, Nck5a does not contain in its structure a conserved cyclin-box characteristic of cyclins. Structure and function analysis of Nck5a, however, has localized the kinase activation domain of Nck5a to a region of 142 residues, Glu150 to Asn291 (which is similar in size to cyclin fold of other cyclins) and this region of Nck5a appears to assume a cyclin-box structure (27Chou K.C. Watenpaugh K.D. Heinrikson R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 259: 420-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the unique structure of Nck5a has evolved to support a number of other functions in addition to the kinase activation. Presumably, some of these functions are manifested in the specific interactions of Nck5a with the various cellular proteins to which it binds. The identification of a specific protein-binding site in Nck5a represents the first attempt in the elucidation of the structural basis of interactions between Nck5a and Nck5a-binding proteins. The binding site is within a subdomain of Nck5a that is important for Cdk5 activation. An amphipathic α-helix in this domain uses its hydrophobic and hydrophilic phases to interact with Cdk5 and the Nck5a-binding proteins, respectively. It should be reiterated that although all three binding proteins studied in the present work appear to bind to this site, it does not indicate that this is a common binding site for all Nck5a-binding proteins as preliminary results have shown that certain other Nck5a-binding proteins bind to Nck5a at distinct sites. 2Z.

https://openalex.org/W2033249095,"The ability of reverse transcriptase to generate, extend, and remove the primer derived from the polypurine tract (PPT) is vital for reverse transcription, since this process determines one of the ends required for integration of the viral DNA. Based on the ability of the RNase H activity of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase to cleave a long RNA/DNA hybrid containing the PPT, it appears that cleavages that could generate the plus-strand primer can occur by an internal cleavage mechanism without any positioning by an RNA 5′-end, and such cleavages may serve to minimize cleavage events within the PPT itself. If the PPT were to be cleaved inappropriately just upstream of the normal plus-strand origin site, the resulting 3′-ends would not be extended by reverse transcriptase. Extension of the PPT primer by at least 2 nucleotides is sufficient for recognition and correct cleavage by RNase H at the RNA-DNA junction to remove the primer. Specific removal of the PPT primer after polymerase extension deviates from the general observation that primer removal occurs by cleavage one nucleotide away from the RNA-DNA junction and suggests that the same PPT specificity determinants responsible for generation of the PPT primer also direct PPT primer removal. Once the PPT primer has been extended and removed from the nascent plus-strand DNA, reinitiation at the resulting plus-strand primer terminus does not occur, providing a mechanism to prevent the repeated initiation of plus strands."

Although the existence of this complex has been known for more than two decades, its assembly process and dynamic status are not well understood. The structure of the multi-ARS complex must accommodate their reaction substrates without steric hindrance, since the component enzymes carry out aminoacylation reactions simultaneously. Thus, it is intriguing how the components are assembled and maintained in the complex. The multi-ARS complex contains three auxiliary proteins, p18, p38, and p43. Since p38 interacts with most of the ARS components, it was proposed to be a scaffold for the assembly of the multi-ARS complex (5Quevillon S. Robinson J-C. Berthonneau E. Siatecka M. Mirande M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 183-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The proposed role of p38 suggests that the formation of the multi-ARS complex is assisted by nonsynthetase factors, although ARSs themselves also interact with each other (7Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S.

Since assembly of many functional complexes in the cell is facilitated by their specific chaperones, we suspected that chaperones might be involved in the biogenesis of the multi-ARS complex (8Cruciat C.-M.

This possibility was first suggested by the results showing the interaction between heat shock protein 90 (hsp90) and human glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), a component of the multi-ARS complex. Although hsp90 is known to protect cellular proteins from heat denaturation or other proteotoxic stresses (12Csermely P. Schnaider T. Soti C. Prohaszka Z. Nardai G. Pharmacol.

The N-terminal domain interacts with ATP (16Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H.

The C-terminal domain is involved in dimerization, which is essential for both function and target interaction (18Minami Y. Kimura Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Yahara I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Although the structural details of hsp90 are well studied, its working mechanism and target selection remain elusive. Here, we report that hsp90 associates with the complex-forming ARSs and mediates their protein-protein interactions. To identify proteins interacting with the three repeats of EPRS, the cDNA encoding the peptide from Val573 to Lys889 of EPRS (EPRS-L) was subcloned into pLex202 vector using EcoRI andSalI sites and used as bait to screen a human HeLa cDNA library expressing B42 fusion proteins (19Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar). The DNA encoding full-length hsp90 was cleaved from pGEX2T-hsp90α (20Nemoto T.

The resulting plasmid was cleaved again withEcoRI and XhoI to release the insert, which was then ligated to pJG4–5 (B42 fusion vector). Positive interactions were confirmed by both cell growth on leucine-depleted yeast synthetic medium and blue colony formation on the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactoside (X-gal, 5 mm)-containing medium.

Polymerase chain reaction products used for construction were confirmed by DNA sequencing, and expression of the LexA-ARS hybrid proteins was determined by immunoblotting with anti-LexA antibody (data not shown). HeLa cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted by ultrasonication. Endogenous EPRS was incubated with anti-EPRS rabbit antiserum and precipitated with protein A-agarose. The precipitated proteins were resolved by SDS gel electrophoresis, transferred onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore Corp.), and immunoblotted with anti-hsp90 antibody (Transduction Laboratories) and the ECL system following the manufacturer's instruction (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Precipitation of EPRS and isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IRS) was confirmed by immunoblotting with their respective antibodies. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies were raised against EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, p43, and p38. After expression as a His tag protein, the full-length MRS, p43, and p38 (denatured), EPRS (the native peptide of three repeats from Val573 to Lys889), LRS (denatured peptide of C-terminal 236 amino acids), QRS (native N-terminal 236 amino acids), and RRS (native N-terminal 72 amino acids) were purified using nickel affinity chromatography (Invitrogen) and used for antibody preparation (details will be available upon request). Antibodies were prepared as described previously (23Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol.

EPRS-L was synthesized by in vitrotranslation in the presence of [35S]methionine using pcDNA3-EPRS-L. The in vitro translated EPRS-L was mixed with the Escherichia coli protein extract containing GST-hsp90 or GST in binding buffer composed of 40 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.3 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture (pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin; 5 μg/ml each). GA (30 μm) or ATP (5 mm) was added as indicated to the binding mixture to assess their effect on the interaction between hsp90 and EPRS. Glutathione-Sepharose was added to the binding mixture and incubated overnight at 4 °C with rotation. The reaction mixture was then washed three times with binding buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and GST or GST-hsp90 was eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione. The eluted proteins were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis, and the presence of EPRS-L was determined by autoradiography. Induction of the reporter genes, β-galactosidase, and leu2 in the two hybrid assay was determined as described below. For the β-galactosidase assay, yeast (EGY48 strain) expressing the two proteins tested was grown overnight in a yeast synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, 2% glucose). After checking absorbance at 600 nm, the cells were transferred in a yeast medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, 2% galactose, 0.2% Me2SO). Equivalent numbers of cells were lysed in Z buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 50 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) containing one drop of 0.1% SDS and two drops of chloroform for 15 min at 30 °C, and then 200 μl of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside was added to determine the β-galactosidase activity. When a yellow color appeared, the reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 1 mNa2CO3. The samples were centrifuged briefly, and the absorbance was measured at 420 and 550 nm. The β-galactosidase activity was calculated using the formula units = (1000 × (A 420 − 1.75 × A 550))/(time × volume ×A 600). To determine the induction of theleu2 gene, the EGY48 strain expressing LexA-IRS-C (from Glu966 to Phe1266) and B42-EPRS-L was cultivated in 5 ml of yeast synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, 2% glucose) at 30 °C overnight with shaking. Cells (1.5 ml) were harvested and resuspended in 1.5 ml of yeast synthetic medium (Ura−, His−, Trp−, Leu−, 2% galactose, and 0.5% raffinose) and then spun down again and resuspended in 1.5 ml of the same broth. 0.2 ml of cells were then transferred to the same broth containing 0.001% SDS and each of the antibiotics, trichostatin A (TSA) (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), GA, and radicicol (RC) (25Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 106-108Crossref Scopus (355) Google Scholar). These cells were cultivated at 30 °C overnight with shaking, and the number of the cells was determined by hemocytometer after the same time interval. The growth of the EGY48 strain alone or expressing LexA-IRS-C and B42 in the presence of these antibiotics was also determined using the same methods, except that the cells were cultivated in yeast synthetic medium containing leucine. Fresh bovine liver (100 g) was immersed in buffer A (25 mm KPO4, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing protease inhibitors (pepstatin A, leupeptin, antipain, and chymostatin (each 5 μg/ml) and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) to remove blood, and this process was repeated five times. The liver was then homogenized (PowerGen 700), and the lysate was centrifuged at 26,000 × g for 45 min. After removing the tissue debris, the supernatant was recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to obtain the postribosomal supernatant. Polyethylene glycol 6000 (Fluka) was added to a final concentration of 2% (w/v) to the supernatant with stirring and mixed for 30 min. The solution was then centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 20 min, the supernatant was removed, and then PEG 6000 was added to a final concentration of 15% (w/v). This solution was then centrifuged, and the pellet was dissolved in buffer A and filtered through a 0.4-μm filter disc. After the filtrate was dialyzed in buffer A, the solution was loaded onto gel filtration column (Bio-Gel A-5m; Bio-Rad). The eluted fractions containing the multi-ARS complex were determined by the aminoacylation activity of IRS. The fractions were then collected and loaded onto a Blue Sepharose (Bio-Rad) column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. After washing the column, the bound proteins were eluted using a gradient of 0–1.3 m KCl. Fractions showing the IRS activity were collected and dialyzed in buffer A and loaded onto a hydroxyapatite column (Bio-Rad). After washing, the proteins in the column were eluted using a phosphate gradient from 100 to 400 mm. The IRS-positive fractions were collected, concentrated, and finally loaded onto a Superdex 200 HR (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The eluted proteins in each fraction were monitored by absorbance at 280 nm and immunoblotting with the mixture of anti-ARS antibodies as indicated. Assembly of the complex-forming ARSs was determined by co-immunoprecipitation of the components with anti-EPRS antibody. HeLa cells were treated with different concentrations of GA (from 5 to 20 μm) for 24 h or treated with 20 μm GA for the indicated time (from 6 to 24 h). Cells were then washed twice with PBS and methionine-free minimal essential medium (Sigma) containing the indicated concentration of GA and incubated for 30 min. Then [35S]methionine (100 μCi/ml) in 10% serum was added to the cells for 1 h. Cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium) containing 1 mm cold methionine was added to the medium for 1 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed with the lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm Na3VO4 and aprotinin 5 μg/ml). Equal amounts of the proteins extracted from each treatment condition were then mixed with anti-EPRS antibody (5 μg) and immunoprecipitated. ARSs co-precipitated with EPRS were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and detected by immunoblotting with a mixture of their specific antibodies (EPRS, IRS, LRS, MRS, and QRS). The nascent ARSs in the whole cell extracts or in the immunoprecipitates were determined by autoradiography. Autoradiography was quantified using a phosphor image analyzer (BAS-3000; Fuji). Human EPRS contains three tandem repeats linking the catalytic domains of the N-terminal glutamyl- and the C-terminal prolyl-tRNA synthetase (Fig.1). It has been previously shown that this peptide region is responsible for the interaction with the C-terminal tandem repeats of human IRS (26Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) as well as nucleic acids (27Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We screened a human HeLa cDNA library to test whether additional proteins could associate with the repeated region of EPRS. From this screening, human hsp90α was selected to interact with the tandem repeats of EPRS via its N-terminal ATP binding domain (Fig.1). hsp90's interaction with EPRS was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. HeLa cells were lysed, and endogenous EPRS was immunoprecipitated with antibody raised against the EPRS peptide. Co-precipitation of hsp90 with EPRS was then determined with anti-hsp90 antibody (Fig.2 A). IRS was previously shown to interact with EPRS (26Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and was also detected in the immunoprecipitate of EPRS. To test whether this interaction depends on the activity of hsp90, HeLa cells were cultivated in the absence and presence of GA, a specific inhibitor of hsp90 (17Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartle F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar, 28Grenert J.P. Sullivan W.P. Fadden P. Haystead T.A.J. Clark J. Mimnaugh E. Krutzsch H. Ochel H.-J. Schulte T.W. Sausville E. Neckers L.M. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23843-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), and the effect of GA on the interaction of EPRS and hsp90 was determined by immunoprecipitation. While the same level of hsp90 was detected in the whole cell lysates of the HeLa cells cultured with and without GA, hsp90 was not co-immunoprecipitated with EPRS in the presence of GA (Fig.2 B). This indicates that the interaction of EPRS and hsp90 depends on the chaperone activity of hsp90. The interaction of hsp90 with EPRS was further analyzed by in vitro pull-down experiments. The EPRS peptide was synthesized by in vitrotranslation in the presence of [35S]methionine, and hsp90 was prepared as GST fusion protein. Either GST alone or GST-hsp90 mixed with the EPRS peptide was affinity-purified using glutathione-Sepharose, and co-purification of the EPRS peptide was determined by autoradiography. The EPRS peptide was specifically eluted as a complex with GST-hsp90 but not with GST alone (Fig.3). The binding sites for GA and ATP are both located in the N-terminal domain of hsp90 that is also responsible for the interaction with EPRS (Fig. 1). Since our co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that the interaction of hsp90 and EPRS was sensitive to the presence of GA, we also tested the effect of these compounds on the interaction of hsp90 and EPRS using an in vitro pull-down assay. EPRS binding to hsp90 was partially inhibited by the addition of GA or ATP (Fig. 3). The GA- or ATP-induced dissociation of hsp90 from the bound peptide was previously reported (29Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Chaperones such as hsp 90 play roles in protein folding, trafficking, degradation, and assembly. EPRS is one of the components for the multi-ARS complex, and previously we have shown that it interacts with IRS. We hypothesized that hsp90 might facilitate the interaction between EPRS and IRS; thus, the effect of hsp90 inhibitors such as GA and RC was tested on the interaction of these two peptides using the yeast two-hybrid system. Since heat shock proteins are highly conserved among different organisms and yeast hsp90 homologue is also sensitive to GA (30Farrelly F.W. Finkelstein D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5745-5751Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Liu X.-D. Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), we treated yeast cells with GA or RC to determine whether these antibiotics affect the interaction between EPRS and IRS. TSA, which affects transcription by inhibiting histone deacetylase (24Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was also employed as a control. Yeast EGY48 cells were cultivated in the presence of each of these drugs individually for 48 h to assess whether these drugs affected cell growth. Cell growth was very slightly affected by treatment with these drugs, suggesting that they were not toxic (Fig.4, right). This result is also consistent with previous reports (31Liu X.-D. Morano K.A. Thiele D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26654-26660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The same host cells expressing both LexA-IRS-C and B42-EPRS-L were grown in yeast synthetic medium without leucine in the presence of the indicated drug. Cell growth in the leucine-depleted medium should be affected by the expression level of leu2 (the reporter gene for the interaction between EPRS and IRS). The growth of cells treated with GA or RC was inhibited by about 80% compared with those without drug or treated with TSA (Fig. 4, left). As a control, the same cells expressing LexA-IRS-C and B42 were treated with these drugs and cultivated in the yeast medium with leucine. The growth of these cells was only slightly affected by the treatment with these drugs (Fig. 4, middle). These results suggest that the interaction of EPRS and IRS is specifically affected by the inhibition of hsp90, further supporting that this interaction is mediated by hsp90. Similar results were obtained when another reporter gene, β-galactosidase, was used for these experiments (data not shown). Although hsp90 was co-immunoprecipitated with EPRS (Fig. 2), we do not know whether hsp90 is associated with EPRS in the multi-ARS complex. The presence of hsp90 has not been previously reported in the purified multi-ARS complex, implying that it either may not be present in or may be weakly associated with this complex. We thus investigated if hsp90 is present in the purified multi-ARS complex. To determine whether hsp90 is present in either the partially purified multi-ARS complex or in its intermediate subcomplexes, we purified the multi-ARS complex and evaluated hsp90 association. The complex was enriched by differential precipitation and by chromatography using several different columns. Although a majority of hsp90 was removed during purification, a slight amount of hsp90 co-eluted with the fractions containing the multi-ARS complex (data not shown). Finally, the proteins in the partially purified complex were separated using a sizing column, and the elution profile was monitored. A major protein peak was observed in the void volume indicative of a macromolecular complex, which was also accompanied by a minor peak (Fig. 5). The fractions found in these peaks were subjected to SDS gel electrophoresis, and several components of the complex (EPRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, p43, and p38) were identified by immunoblotting with a mixture of their corresponding antibodies. While the major peak contained all of these components, the minor peak only showed the signals for EPRS, QRS, RRS, and p43. The presence of these four components is consistent with the interaction map determined by genetic and cross-linking analyses (7Rho S.B. Kim M.J. Lee J.S. Seol W. Montegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 23Park S.G. Jung K.H. Lee J.S. Jo Y.J. Motegi H. Kim S. Shiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16673-16676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 32Norcum M.T. Warrington J.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 79-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). hsp90 was not found in the major peak containing more components of the multi-ARS complex but was present in the fraction containing the sub-ARS complex. Based on the molecular weight of hsp90, the free form of hsp90 is not expected to be present in this fraction. Thus, hsp90 appears to be associated with the sub-ARS complex but not with the complete multi-ARS complex. The results above suggest that hsp90 would be more generally involved in the molecular interactions of the complex-forming ARSs. We thus investigated whether there is a distinction between which ARSs interact with hsp90. Interactions of hsp90 with different ARSs were tested by yeast two-hybrid assay. A total of 15 full-length human ARSs, and the nonsynthetase components, p18, p38, and p43, were fused to LexA and tested for the interaction with B42-hsp90. Among the ARSs tested, LRS, MRS, QRS, KRS, DRS, and RRS form a complex with nonsynthetase protein factors, p18, p38, and p43, while the ARSs, CRS, GRS, HRS, SRS, TRS, VRS, WRS, and YRS have not been found in this complex (1Mirande M. Gache Y. Le Corre D. Waller J.P. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 2Cirakoglu B. Mirande M. Waller J.P. FEBS Lett. 1985; 183: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 3Norcum M.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15043-15051Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among the complex-forming ARSs, hsp90 showed strong interactions with MRS, QRS, DRS, and p38. In contrast, no significant interactions were observed with the non-complex-forming ARSs, although weak interactions were observed with GRS, HRS, and WRS (Fig. 6). These results suggest that hsp90 interacts preferentially with some of the complex-forming ARSs. The experiments above showed that the interaction between EPRS and IRS was severely affected by the addition of hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. 4). In addition, hsp90 is bound to the sub-ARS complex but not to the complete multi-ARS complex (Fig. 5) and also preferentially associates with some of the complex-forming ARSs (Fig.6). All of these results imply that hsp90 may be involved in the associations of other complex-forming ARSs, in addition to the pair of EPRS and IRS. If this were the case, inhibition of hsp90 would be predicted to either disrupt or retard the assembly of the complex-forming ARSs. To address this possibility, we decided to monitor whether the incorporation of the newly synthesized ARSs to the multi-ARS complex is affected by the activity of hsp90. In these experiments, HeLa cells were treated for different times or with different concentrations of GA, and the nascent polypeptides were labeled in vivo with [35S]methionine. The cells were then harvested, and proteins were extracted from the cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-EPRS antibody. The ARS components (IRS, LRS, MRS, QRS, RRS, and KRS) co-precipitated with EPRS were then separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis and quantified by autoradiography. Cellular protein synthesis was determined by autoradiography of the protein extracts. The total amounts of the co-precipitated ARSs were compared by the immunoblotting of the ARS components using their respective antibodies. First, the cells were treated with 20 μm GA and harvested at different time intervals. The harvested cells were lysed, and the multi-ARS complex was precipitated using anti-EPRS antibody from the extracted proteins. Immunoblotting with the corresponding ARS antibodies showed that the similar amounts of the ARS components were precipitated at each time point (Fig.7 A, middle panel). The precipitated ARS complex was then subjected to autoradiography. The amount of EPRS precipitated with anti-EPRS antibody was decreased to about 75% of the control by the treatment of GA for 24 h. The incorporation of other co-precipitated ARSs was decreased from 0 to 30% under the same conditions (Fig. 7 A,left panel and line plot). Autoradiography of the total cellular protein showed that protein synthesis was not affected by treatment with GA (Fig. 7 A,right panel). This suggests that inactivation of hsp90 interferes with assembly of the nascent ARSs. To further confirm this result, cells were then treated with different concentrations of GA, and its effects on the incorporation of the ARS components to the complex were monitored. Cells treated under each concentration were harvested, and the multi-ARS complex were extracted and precipitated with anti-EPRS antibody as described above. The incorporation of the nascent ARS components was also determined by autoradiography. The assembly of the nascent ARS components in the absence of GA was determined by the immunoprecipitation of the ARS complex with anti-EPRS antibody and used as a control (Fig.7 B, left panel, leftmost lane). Then the effect of different concentrations of GA on the assembly of the ARS components was determined by the same method. The incorporation of the nascent ARSs to the complex was impaired by GA treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7 B,left panel and line plot). The cellular protein synthesis was not affected by the GA treatment as determined by the autoradiography of the whole cell extract (Fig.7 B, right panel). The stability of the preexisting multi-ARS complex remained the same without GA treatment during the cultivation of the cells (data not shown). These results indicate that the incorporation of the nascent ARS components to the multi-ARS complex was sensitive to the activity of hsp90. Although hsp90 is one of the most abundant cellular proteins, it is highly restrictive in target selection under normal physiological conditions. Identified targets of hsp90 include steroid hormone receptors, kinases, regulatory factors, and enzymes (13Buchner J. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 136-141Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 33Pratt W.B. Toft D.O. Endocrinol. Rev. 1997; 18: 306-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). However, the cellular concentration of hsp90 is much higher than its known target molecules, suggesting that more hsp90 substrates remain to be identified. In addition, the role of hsp90 in the formation of macromolecular protein complexes is not well understood. Herein, we suggest that hsp90 associates with a subset of mammalian ARSs to facilitate their protein-protein interactions. The N-terminal domain of hsp90α responsible for the binding to GA and ATP (16Prodromou C. Roe S.M. O'Brien R Ladbury J.E. Piper P.W. Pearl L.H. Cell. 1997; 90: 65-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, 17Stebbins C.E. Russo A.A. Schneider C. Rosen N. Hartle F.U. Pavletich N.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 239-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1222) Google Scholar) associates with the EPRS peptide that also interacts with other complex-forming ARSs (26Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 27Rho S.B. Lee J.S. Jeong E.-J. Kim K.-S. Kim Y.G. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11267-11273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The association of hsp90 with EPRS was sensitive to hsp90 inhibitor, GA, and ATP (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting a specific interaction. In addition, the ATP-induced dissociation of hsp90 from EPRS is consistent with a previous report that millimolar concentrations of ATP induce the dissociation of hsp90 from actin filaments (34Kellermayer M.S. Csermely P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 211: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results indicate that the chaperone activity of hsp90 is required for its interaction with EPRS. While hsp90 preferentially associated with the sub-ARS complex, it was not found to be present in the multi-ARS complex, suggesting that it may be involved in the assembly process but not the maintenance of the multi-ARS complex (Fig. 5). This is also reminiscent of a recent report on the role of a mitochondrial protein, Bcs1p, in the assembly of the cytochrome bc1 complex (8Cruciat C.-M. Hell K. Folsch H. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5233-5266Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This protein also binds to a subcomplex to facilitate the assembly pathway of the cytochrome complex. A possible role of hsp90 in the macromolecular assembly of ARSs was further supported by the inhibitory effect of GA or RC on the interaction between EPRS and IRS (Fig. 4) and, more directly, on the assembly of the nascent complex-forming ARSs in vivo (Fig. 7). Although the cellular protein synthesis was not affected by the GA treatment, the amount of the nascent ARSs co-precipitated with anti-EPRS was decreased by the inactivation of hsp90. This result implies that the stability of ARSs is sensitive to the activity of hsp90. In this regard, it is worth noting that CFTR is destabilized by interfering with its interaction with hsp90 (35Loo M.A. Jensen T.J. Cui L. Hou Y.-X. Chang X.-B. Riordan J.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6879-6887Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Thus, ARSs not incorporated to the complex may be either degraded or aggregated. However, the stability of the preexisting ARS complex did not seem to be severely affected by GA treatment because the similar amounts of the multi-ARS complex were precipitated from both treated and untreated cells with anti-EPRS antibody (Fig. 7, A and B,middle panel). Similarly, hsp90 is important for the membrane association of newly synthesized Src-kinase p56 lck , but not its maintenance (36Bijlmakers M.-J.J.E. Marsh M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 1585-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The interaction of hsp90 with ARSs appears to be dynamic based on the induction level of the reporter gene leu2 in two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 6). Under physiological conditions, ATP is present at millimolar levels; thus, most of hsp90 would be expected to be associated with ATP in vivo (29Scheibel T. Weikl T. Buchner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1495-1499Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Further, since ATP stimulated the dissociation of hsp90 from EPRS (Fig. 3), it would be predicted that the cellular interactions of hsp90 with ARSs would be dynamic. Nonetheless, the potential of ARSs for the interaction with hsp90 appears to be well correlated with their propensity for the complex formation (Fig. 6). The known substrates for hsp90 do not share sequence or structural characteristics. Furthermore, ARSs interacting with hsp90 do not show any common sequence or structural features. Instead, the two classes of ARS that interact and do not interact with hsp90 may differ in conformational stability or folding characteristics. Perhaps, the complex-forming ARSs may be unstable in isolation and need to be associated with chaperones like hsp90 until they are associated with the neighboring ARSs. Among the non-complex-forming ARSs, some members including GRS, HRS, and WRS showed slightly higher affinity to hsp90 than others. Interestingly, these ARSs also contain motifs homologous to the EPRS repeats in their N-terminal extensions (37Shiba K. Schimmel P. Motegi H. Noda T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30049-30055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tsui F.W. Siminovitch L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 3349-3367Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 39Frolova L.Y. Sudomoina M.A. Grigorieva A.Y. Zinovieva O.L. Kisselev L.L. Gene (Amst. ). 1991; 109: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Further, the potential for the association of GRS with the complex-forming IRS has been previously suggested, although it is classified as a non-complex former (26Rho S.B. Lee K.H. Kim J.W. Shiba K. Jo Y.J. Kim S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10128-10133Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Thus, hsp90 may be also involved in protein-protein interactions of some non-complex-forming ARSs. Various cellular machineries exist as macromolecular complexes. Thus, it is important to understand the biogenesis and dynamics of these complexes. The involvement of chaperones in macromolecular assembly has been reported in many cases. The formation of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase is assisted by the plant homologue of E. coli groEL (9Hemmingsen S.M. Woolford C. van der Vies S.M. Tilly K. Dennis D.T. Georgopoulos C.P.

Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar), and the assembly of bacteriophage capsids also involves chaperones (11Grimaud R. Toussaint A. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 1148-1153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we suggest that hsp90 may play a role in mediating protein-protein interactions between the complex-forming ARSs. We thank Drs. K. Shiba, E. D. First, R. D. Campbell, and T. Takagi for kindly providing materials and Dr. W. Seol for critical reading and advice."

PMA treatment rapidly induced hVH5 transcripts in these cells, and induced expression of M3/6 completely inhibited PMA-stimulated phosphorylation of SAPK, suggesting a feedback loop to control SAPK activity. Using both stable cell lines and transient transfection we demonstrate that activation of SAPK rapidly stimulated phosphorylation of M3/6. This phosphorylation did not regulate the half-life of total cellular M3/6. hVH5 and M3/6 shares with all sequenced mammalian DSPs an amino acid motif,XILPXLXL, located approximately 80 amino acids from the active site. The hVH5-M3/6 sequence, RILPHLYL, shares significant homology with the SAPK binding site of the c-Jun protein, called the delta domain. This motif was found to be important for DSP function, because deletion of RILPHLYL inhibits SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of M3/6, and deletion of this sequence or mutation of the LYL portion blocks the ability of this phosphatase to dephosphorylate SAPK.

The addition of phorbol esters, e.g. phorbol 12-myristate,13-acetate (PMA) to hematopoietic cells activates these protein kinases and induces both cellular differentiation and apoptosis. In particular, PMA treatment causes the megakaryocytic differentiation of K562 cells (1Whalen A.M. Galasinski S.C. Shapiro P.S. Nahreini T.S. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1947-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Thus far, five MAPK cascade pathways have been identified in eukaryotic cells, of which three have been relatively well characterized: the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway; the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) or c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway; and the p38 pathway (reviewed in Refs. 2Schaeffer H.J. Weber M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (1404) Google Scholar and 3Tibbles L.A. Woodgett J.R. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 55: 1230-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). The complexity of cellular responses to activation of these pathways, many of which are cell type-specific, has generated intense interest in how cells regulate the activity of these individual protein kinase cascades. Regulation of the SAPK pathway is of particular interest, because SAPK in some contexts appears to play an obligatory role in apoptosis and embryonic development. Dual knockouts in mice of JNK 1 and JNK 2 cause embryonic lethality due to severe dysregulation of apoptosis during brain development (4Kuan C.-Y. Yang D.D. Roy D.R.S. Davis R.J. Rakic P. Flavell R.A. Neuron. 1999; 22: 667-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar), the defect being either pro- or anti-apoptotic depending on the brain region. Drosophila mutants which lack the homologue of either SAPK (DJNK) or its activator kinase (5Sluss H.K. Han Z. Barrett T. Davis R.J. Ip Y.T. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2745-2758Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 6Glise B. Bourbon H. Noselli S. Cell. 1995; 83: 451-461Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) die at an early stage with a failure of the dorsal epidermis to close over the amnioserosa. Interestingly, DJNK increases expression of Puckered, a dual-specificity phosphatase, which appears to participate in a feedback loop to control DJNK activity (7Martin-Blanco E. Gampel A. Ring J. Virdee K. Kirov N. Tolkovsky A.M. Martinez-Arias A. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Although some tyrosine phosphatases are known to act specifically on members of the MAPK cascades (e.g. Ref. 8Pulido R. Zuniga A. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7337-7350Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), the gene family of dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs) has emerged as a prime candidate for in vivo negative regulation of the MAPKs (reviewed in Refs. 9Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar and 10Haneda M. Sugimoto T. Kikkawa R. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 365: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The prototypical DSP, VHI, was originally identified as an open reading frame in vaccinia virus (11Guan K. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar); the bacterially expressed protein was shown to be capable of dephosphorylating protein substrates containing both phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine residues. Subsequently, the crystal structure was determined, which showed strong secondary structural links with mammalian DSPs and the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) (12Yuvaniyama J. Denu J.M. Dixon J.E. Saper M.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1328-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). At this point, nine human DSPs are known. All DSPs share the phosphotyrosine catalytic site consensus sequence (I/V)HCXAGXR(S/T)G, strong homologies in a region of approximately 140 residues encompassing the catalytic site, and short regions of homology with the cell cycle regulatory protein cdc25 (CH2 domain (13Keyse S.M. Ginsburg M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 377-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar)). A number of DSP genes undergo transcriptional up-regulation in response to growth factors and/or cellular stress (summarized in Ref. 9Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (718) Google Scholar); in several instances the ERK or SAPK cascades have been implicated in this response (MKP-1: Refs. 14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 15Brondello J.-M. Brunet A. Pouysségur J. McKenzie F.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2913-2921Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar; M3/6: this paper). With a few exceptions, the substrate specificities of the DSPs appear to be broad, acting approximately equally on ERK, SAPK, and p38. The exceptions are MKP-1, which in vivo in U937 cells preferentially dephosphorylates p38 and SAPK (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar); MKP-3 (Pyst1), which has a preference for ERK and is activated by binding to ERK2 (17Muda M. Theodosiou A. Gillieron C. Smith A. Chabert C. Camps M. Boschert U. Rodrigues N. Davies K. Ashworth A. Arkinstall S. J. Biol.

Science. 1998; 280: 1262-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar); MKP-5, which preferentially dephosphorylates SAPK and p38 (19Tanoue T. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19949-19956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 20Theodosiou A. Smith A. Gillieron C. Arkinstall S. Ashworth A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6981-6988Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar); and hVH5, which also has a strong preference for SAPK and p38 (22Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Previously, we demonstrated that MKP-1 is induced by PMA treatment of U937 cells, suggesting a feedback regulation of SAPK/JNK activity. Using MAPK inhibitors, we demonstrated that PMA-induced regulation of MKP-1 is most likely mediated by ERK2 activation (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Because MKP-1 is a member of the DSP family, we have investigated whether other members of this family play a role in regulating the SAPK/JNK pathway in hematopoietic cells. Using K562 leukemia cells, we demonstrate that PMA-induced stimulation of the SAPK pathway causes marked increases in the steady-state levels of the hVH5 mRNA. We utilized M3/6, the murine orthologue of hVH5, for further analysis of specificity and regulation. hVH5 and M3/6 are 90% identical at the amino acid level (21Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H. McLellan-Arnold E. Boyd Y. Leversha M.A. Owen N. Blake D.J. Ashworth A. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), excluding a discrete 45-amino acid sequence present in M3/6 that is composed mainly (44/45 residues) of glycine and serine, as a result of a 138-bp complex trinucleotide repeat distal to the catalytic domain, which is absent from the hVH5 cDNA sequence. Induced expression of transfected M3/6 protein in K562 cells completely inhibits the PMA-induced activation of SAPK and partially blocks the activation of p38 protein kinase but has no effect on ERK kinase, demonstrating that this family of enzymes could have an essential role in SAPK/JNK activity regulation. In addition, PMA activates SAPK to phosphorylate the M3/6 protein. Unlike MKP-1 (28Brondello J. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar), this phosphorylation does not appear to change the half-life of M3/6 protein. M3/6 contains a region of similarity to the c-Jun SAPK interaction domain, the delta domain. Deletion or mutation of this domain in M3/6 prevents the SAPK-mediated phosphorylation of this protein and/or blocks the ability of M3/6 to dephosphorylate SAPK. Examination of multiple DSP sequences demonstrates that portions of this delta-like domain are conserved among many members of this family of enzymes. . HMTIIa-M3/6 was constructed by subcloning a 2.5-kb-blunted SalI-XbaI fragment from MTSM-M3/6 (a gift from A. Ashworth (23Muda M. Theodosiou A. Rodrigues N. Boschert U. Camps M. Gillieron C. Davies K.

The M3/6 insert is of full length and contains an amino-terminal myc epitope tag. The resulting expression vector contained a hygromycin B-selectable marker. For mutagenesis purposes, a KpnI/BamHI fragment from HMTIIa-M3/6 was subcloned into the same sites of pBluescript SKII (Stratagene), which resulted in two NotI sites flanking the M3/6 coding sequence. M3/6 WT, in which M3/6 is placed under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter, was constructed by subcloning thisNotI fragment into the NotI site of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), which also possesses a selectable marker for neomycin resistance. An hVH-5 construct was a gift of K. Martell (22Martell K.J. Seasholtz A.F. Kwak S.P. Clemens K.K. Dixon J.E. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 1823-1833Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). pCMV-HA-SAPK and pCMV-HA-SAPK T183A/Y185F were gifts from J. Woodgett. The anti-myc epitope antibody 9E10(UCCC), used for Western blotting, was obtained from the cell culture core, University of Colorado Cancer Center. Anti-myc epitope antibody 9E10 used for immunoprecipitation, and anti-HA epitope 12CA5 were obtained from Babco, Richmond, CA. Antibodies against SAPK and phospho-SAPK (7345 and 6254, respectively) were obtained from Santa Cruz. Antibodies against phospho-ERK 1,2 and phospho-p38 (9101 and 9211, respectively) were obtained from New England BioLabs. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and anisomycin were obtained from Sigma. The MEK 1/2 inhibitor PD98059 and p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 were purchased from Calbiochem. K562 cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal calf serum or iron-supplemented bovine calf serum. COS-7 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% iron-supplemented bovine calf serum. Transient transfections were performed using either DEAE-dextran as described previously (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar) or LipofectAMINE-Plus reagent (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfections were performed by electroporation (250 V, 250 μF; Gene Pulser, Bio-Rad Laboratories). One day post-transfection, cells were distributed into 6-well plates in selective media containing 200 μg/ml Hygromycin B (Mediatech; Fisher). After 1 week of selection, individual clones were transferred into 12-well plates for expansion in selective medium. Whole cell extracts were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). For analysis of inducible M3/6 (myc) protein, K562 cells (107) were metabolically labeled in the absence or presence of 2 μmCd2+ for 4 h in methionine or phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% dialyzed bovine calf serum and 0.1 mCi/ml Tran35S-label (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) or carrier-free 32PO4 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), and myc-tagged M3/6 protein was immunoprecipitated with 9E10 antibody prebound to protein A/G-Sepharose (Calbiochem). Immunoprecipitates were washed extensively in cell lysis buffer, resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and visualized by autoradiography. Scanning densitometry was performed with Alpha Imager 2000 equipment and software. Primers were obtained from Life Technologies. Mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of 1.3 mbetaine (Sigma) using either M3/6 WT or M3/6 subcloned into pBluescript SKII. Mutations were verified by DNA sequencing (DNA Sequencing and Analysis Core, Cancer Center, University of Colorado). Primer sequences are available on request. RNA isolation, transfer, and hybridization conditions were essentially as described previously (24Rininsland F. Johnson T.R. Chernicky C.L. Schultz E. Burfeind P. Ilan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5854-5859Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The full-length hVH5 labeled with [32P]dCTP using the RadPrime kit (Life Technologies) was used as a probe for Northern blots. To examine whether dual-specificity phosphatases, in addition to MKP-1 (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), are regulated during phorbol ester-induced differentiation of K562 cells, we performed Northern analysis of RNA from K562 cells treated with various stimuli. RNA transcripts for hVH5, the human orthologue of M3/6, were previously reported to be most abundant in brain (21Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H. McLellan-Arnold E. Boyd Y. Leversha M.A. Owen N. Blake D.J. Ashworth A. Davies K.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 675-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar); their presence in myeloid tissue was not examined. As shown in Fig.1 A, hVH5 RNA transcripts were not detectable in untreated K562 cells but were strongly induced by PMA (which activates the ERK, SAPK, and p38 signal cascades in K562 cells;cf. Fig. 2). To begin to decipher the pathways involved in hVH5 induction, K562 cells were treated with anisomycin, a strong stimulator of the SAPK pathway (25Kyriakis J.M. Banerjee P. Nikolakaki E. Dai T. Rubie E.A. Ahmad M.F. Avruch J. Woodgett J.R. Nature. 1994; 369: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (2413) Google Scholar). As with PMA, anisomycin treatment resulted in rapid elevation of hVH5 transcript levels (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that activation of the SAPK signal cascade might be responsible for accumulation of hVH5 RNA transcripts. To examine this point further, we performed Northern analysis of RNA from K562 cells treated with anisomycin, in the presence and absence of inhibitors of MEK1/2 (PD98059) and p38 (SB202474). These agents suppress ERK2 and p38 activation, respectively, by over 80% in U937 cells (14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 C, pretreatment with PD98059 or SB202474 did not reduce hVH5 RNA transcript levels in response to PMA treatment, suggesting that activation of the SAPK signal cascade plays a significant role in PMA-induced hVH5 RNA transcript accumulation.Figure 1hVH5 RNA transcript accumulation in response to PMA or anisomycin in K562 cells.

Equal numbers (106) of K562 cells stably transfected with the hMTIIa-M3/6 construct were treated with various concentrations of Cd2+ for 4.5 h. Cells were then challenged with 200 nm PMA for 10 min, chilled on ice, and processed for Western analysis.

This construct contained an amino-terminal myc tag recognized by the 9E10(UCCC) antibody, and was driven by the cadmium (Cd2+)-inducible human metallothionein promoter (hMTIIa-M3/6). To test substrate specificity of M3/6, equal numbers of cells were incubated at different Cd2+ concentrations for 4.5 h, followed by challenge with 200 nm PMA for the last 10 min of incubation to activate the MAPK family of enzymes, SAPK, ERK and p38. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blot analysis to evaluate M3/6 expression, and the extent of phosphorylation of SAPK, ERK, and p38 was evaluated using phosphospecific antibodies. Phosphorylation of the MAPK family of enzymes was used as a surrogate for activation of these enzymes (26Derijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.H. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2955) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, M3/6 expression was detected at the added Cd2+ concentrations of 0.5, 1, and 2 μm, whereas no induction was detected at a Cd2+ concentration of 0.1 μm. In the absence of M3/6 expression, PMA treatment induced the phosphorylation of all three protein kinases (Fig. 2, B–D; 0 μmCd2+). At the higher Cd2+ concentrations, SAPK and p38 showed decreased phosphorylation compared with controls with no Cd2+ added. Densitometric analysis of the Western blots shown in Fig. 2 indicated that, at 0.5 μmCd2+, PMA-induced phosphorylation of p38 was reduced by 70%. At the same Cd2+ concentration, PMA-induced SAPK phosphorylation was completely prevented; residual phosphorylation was 8% of unstimulated cells. ERK phosphorylation remained unaffected. The same experiments were performed with K562 cells stably transfected with the pMEP4 vector containing no insert. In this case, the levels of PMA-stimulated SAPK and p38 phosphorylation did not differ appreciably from those attained in the absence of Cd2+; the same was true for total protein levels of SAPK (data not shown; cf.also Ref. 14Franklin C.C. Kraft A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16917-16923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). We also examined levels of phosphorylated SAPK in hMTIIa-M3/6 transfectants treated with Cd2+ in the absence of PMA. Cd2+ addition alone did not stimulate the phosphorylation of SAPK, and, as expected because of the induction of M3/6, tended to lower background SAPK phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus in K562 cells, M3/6, the orthologue of hVH5, showed more activity toward SAPK than p38 kinase and did not dephosphorylate ERK protein kinases. In PMA-treated cells conditionally expressing M3/6, this protein was detected by the anti-myc 9E10(UCCC) antibody as a broad band (Fig. 2 A), suggesting the possibility that PMA treatment resulted in some post-translational modification of the M3/6 protein. To address this point, hMTIIa-M3/6 cells were treated with 2 μm Cd2+ for 4 h, followed by PMA treatment for intervals up to 2 h in the continued presence of Cd2+. These cells were then processed for Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 3 A, themyc-stained M3/6 band demonstrated a shift toward higher molecular weight that was maximal at 1 h of PMA treatment, decreasing thereafter, with little shift visible by 2 h. To investigate the nature of this upward shift in mobility, hMTIIa-M3/6 cells were treated with Cd2+ for 5 h in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate. PMA or anisomycin was added for the last hour of incubation. Following cell lysis, the M3/6 protein was immunoprecipitated with 9E10 antibody, and the washed immunoprecipitates subjected to electrophoresis were followed by autoradiography. The results (Fig. 3 B) demonstrate that treatment with PMA markedly increased phosphorylation of the M3/6 protein. Similar results were obtained with anisomycin treatment (Fig.3 B; compare lane 2 with lane 4) in which the increase in phosphorylation was associated with an upward shift in mobility in the M3/6 protein. Thus, PMA and anisomycin induced phosphorylation of M3/6 and caused a retardation in its mobility in SDS-polyacrylamide gels. To test the possibility that phosphorylation of M3/6 could be induced by SAPK, a transient transfection assay in COS-7 cells was developed, which allowed the examination of qualitative effects on the upward shift in mobility in M3/6 protein. In this instance (Fig.4), two inactive mutants of M3/6 (M3/6 C246S and M3/6 D215A) were used to prevent inactivation of SAPK. The M3/6 C246S cDNA replaced the essential cysteine at the catalytic site (11Guan K. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), whereas the M3/6 D215A encoded a protein that was a potential dominant-negative phosphatase (27Flint A.J. Tiganis T. Barford D. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1680-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Neither of these constructs showed phosphatase activity in transient transfection assays (cf. Fig. 8). M3/6 C246S and M3/6 D215A were cotransfected into COS-7 cells with either HA-tagged active SAPK, or an HA-tagged mutant SAPK T183A/Y185F in which the phosphorylation sites were mutated, rendering the kinase inactive. 48 h after transfection, the cells were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. Cotransfection of the M3/6 constructs (Fig. 4) with HA-SAPK but not with inactive HA-SAPK T183A/Y185F resulted in a band of retarded mobility, which reacted with the 9E10(UCCC) antibody. In a repetition of this experiment, cotransfection of M3/6 C246S and M3/6 D215A with HA-SAPK resulted in a band of retarded mobility, whereas substitution of tagged wild-type ERK or p38 constructs for HA-SAPK had no effect. These results are consistent with the phosphorylation of this protein by active SAPK but not inactive SAPK. It was recently reported that the activation of ERK can lead to the phosphorylation of DSP MKP-1 at two sites close to the carboxyl terminus and that this phosphorylation resulted in an increased half-life of the phosphatase (28Brondello J. Pouyssegur J. McKenzie F.R. Science. 1999; 286: 2514-2517Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). To test the possibility that PMA-induced phosphorylation of M3/6 leads to an increase in half-life of the protein, a pulse-chase experiment was carried out using the K562 cell line expressing Cd2+-inducible M3/6. The cells were treated with Cd2+ for 5 h in the presence of [35S]methionine and during the final hour incubated either with 200 nm PMA or vehicle. The cells were then washed and incubated for various intervals in medium without Cd2+ or PMA, supplemented with nonradioactive methionine. Immunoprecipitates were prepared with the anti-myc 9E10 antibody and subjected to electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Densitometric analysis of the autoradiograms was performed for both PMA-treated and untreated samples, including the molecular weight region in which the PMA-induced mobility shift was located. The results are shown in Fig. 5. Half-life estimates for M3/6 were 1.9 h for PMA-treated cells, and 2.1 h for vehicle-treated cells, which were not statistically different. In agreement with the data presented in Fig. 4 A, the autoradiographic density associated with the PMA-induced mobility shift disappears in about 1 h, suggesting that either rapid dephosphorylation or degradation of phosphorylated M3/6 protein was occurring. These results suggest that PMA treatment does not markedly affect the half-life of this protein. M3/6 and its human orthologue hVH5 contain the amino acid sequence RILPHLYLG at amino acids 163–171 (21Theodosiou A.M. Rodrigues N.R. Nesbit M.A. Ambrose H.J. Paterson H. McLellan-Arnold E. Boyd Y.

The ILP and L(Y/F)LG elements of this motif occur in all currently sequenced mammalian DSPs at a similar location relative to the active site (Fig.6 A). The presence of the amino-terminal arginine, which is unique to M3/6 and hVH5 among the DSPs, makes this sequence conform to a “delta domain” consensus motif known to be critical for binding of other proteins to SAPK and ERK (29–34; Fig. 6 B). Furthermore, it was demonstrated that both the arginine and LXL elements of this motif were important in binding of ERK to the transcription factor Elk-1 (32Yang S. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J.

The present study demonstrates selective expression by ceramide of retinoic acid receptor-α (RAR-α) and retinoic X receptor-α (RXR-α) in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells and a functional role of SPP-mediated AP-1 in the signaling mechanism of ligand-dependent transcriptional activity of heterodimers of these receptors in the cells. C2- and C6-ceramides selectively stimulated the expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes, but not that of β and γ isoform genes of RAR and RXR, in the cells. The C2-ceramide-induced stimulation was clearly inhibited bydl-threo-dihydrosphingosine, an inhibitor of sphingosine kinase. SPP also selectively stimulated the expression of both receptors and increased the specific binding of the nuclear proteins to direct repeat 5 (DR-5), a consensus sequence of RAR-RXR. In addition, SPP markedly stimulated transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activity of retinoic acid-dependent transcriptional activity in the cells transfected with a DR-5-CAT reporter gene. The SPP stimulation was activation protein-1 (AP-1)-dependent, because the SPP stimulatory action toward these nuclear gene expressions and the transient CAT activity were inhibited by antisense c-fosand c-junoligonucleotides. We observed that SPP actually stimulated AP-1 transcriptional activity in the cells.

RA displays multiple biological actions through the transcriptional function of two distinct classes of receptors RAR (RAR-α, -β, and -γ) and RXR (RXR-α, -β, and -γ) that bind as heterodimers to their respective target DNA sequences (24Lohnes D.

Because it has been well documented that RXR, as an auxiliary protein, forms heterodimers with receptor of vitamin D3 and thyroid hormone (28Evans R.M.

In view of the above, it is of interest to investigate whether sphingosine metabolites function as a signaling molecule in the expression of RARs and RXRs in osteoblasts and, if so, to explore the signaling mechanism involved in their expression. We demonstrate herein that ceramide selectively stimulated the expression of the α isoform of RAR and RXR and that the transcriptional activity of these receptors in osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells occurred via an SPP-mediated AP-1 pathway. N-Acetylsphingosine (C2-ceramide), N-hexanoylsphingosine (C6-ceramide), SPP,dl-threo-1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-pyrrolidino-1-propanol (PPPP), and dl-threo-dihydrosphingosine (DHS) were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Sphingomyelinase, fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA), and pyrrolidine-dithio-carbamate (PDTC) were obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Curcumin was purchased from Nacalai tesque (Kyoto, Japan). α-MEM was obtained from Flow Laboratory (McLean, VA), and fetal calf serum was obtained from Hyclone (Logan, UT). [α-32P]dCTP, [γ-32P]ATP, and the megaprime DNA labeling system were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Japan (Tokyo, Japan). The oligonucleotide 5′-end-labeling system was purchased from PerkinElmer (Boston, MA). Cells of the clonal osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cell line were cultured to the subconfluent state in α-MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in air, washed, and then incubated overnight in serum-free α-MEM. They were then washed and treated with test samples at various concentrations. Sphingolipids were added to cells as a complex with 0.4% fatty acid-free BSA in serum-free α-MEM. Each plasmid containing the mouse RAR or RXR-α, -β, and -γ cDNA sequences was provided by Dr. P. Chambon. A plasmid containing β-actin cDNA was obtained from Oncor (Gaithersburg, MA). Total cellular RNA was extracted by the guanidine isothiocyanate procedure (30Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

The membranes were baked, prehybridized, and then hybridized to each cDNA probe labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by use of a megaprime DNA labeling system. After hybridization, the membranes were washed, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) at −70 °C. β-Actin was used as an internal standard for quantification of total mRNA in each lane of the gel. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific for RAR-α and RXR-β were provided by Dr. P. Chambon. MC3T3-E1 cells (1 × 107 cells) were lysed with lysis buffer (10 mmTris, pH 7.9, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 20 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216178) Google Scholar). The samples (50 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide slab gels, with Tris-glycine buffer (0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, 0.1% SDS). The proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) by means of a semidry transblot system (ATTO Co., Tokyo, Japan), employing transfer buffer composed of 0.025 m Tris, 0.192 m glycine, and 20% methanol. Next, the membrane was washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris buffer saline (TBS; 100 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl) and blocked for 12 h with 2% skim milk in TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The membrane was subsequently washed with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and next incubated for 18 h with antibody against RAR-α or RXR-α diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% BSA. After further washing with TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated for 3 h with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (New England BioLabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) diluted 1:1000 in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. After having been washed with 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS, the membrane was incubated with LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagent (New England BioLabs, Inc.) and peroxide. Finally, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film. Subconfluent cell monolayers in 15-cm diameter dishes were treated or not with test samples as indicated in the figure legends, and then their cell nuclei were isolated as described earlier (10Takeshita A.

Nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation for 60 min at 25,000 × g and demineralized by passage through a Sephadex G-25 column equilibrated with buffer C (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.02 m KCl, 0.04 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mmPMSF).

Double-stranded oligonucleotides for 5′-AGCTTCAGGTCACCAGGAGGTCAGAGAGCT-3′ of the DR-5 binding site with high affinity for RAR-RXR heterodimers and 30-mer double-stranded oligonucleotides containing -TGACTCA- (Oncogene Science, Inc.) of the AP-1 binding site, i.e. TRE, were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by the oligonucleotide 5′-end-labeling method. In some experiments, after a further incubation for 5 min on ice, antibodies specific for RAR and RXR were added, and the reaction mixture was maintained on ice for 15 min before being loaded onto polyacrylamide gels. DNA-protein complexes were electrophoresed on native 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25 × TBE buffer (22 mm Tris, 22 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). Gels were vacuumed, dried, and exposed to Kodak x-ray film at −70 °C. The plasmid pDR-5-β-globulin-CAT was constructed by inserting a synthetic oligonucleotide containing the DR-5 sequence, which encodes two copies of AGGTCA in directed repeat separated by five nucleotides, withHindIII-XbaI sites into the corresponding sites of pβ-globulin-CAT, which contains the β-globulin promoter enhancer region located upstream of the CAT gene (pDR-5-β-globulin-CAT and pβ-globulin-CAT plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. S.

Chem. 1998; 269: 21379-21384Google Scholar), the cells (1 × 104) were inoculated in 5-cm diameter dishes and incubated for 12 h in 10% fetal calf serum containing α-MEM. Then, the cells were washed three times with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD), transfected with a total of 7 μg of DNA by use of 10 μg of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), and incubated for 6 h in serum-free Opti-MEM. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of reporter plasmid or control plasmid (pDR-5-β-globulin-CAT or pβ-globulin-CAT plasmids for measuring RAR-RXR transcriptional activity; pTRE-TK-CAT or pTK-CAT plasmids for measuring AP-1 transcriptional activity). The assay was performed in the presence of 1 μg of pGL-3-Enhancer vector, a luciferase expression plasmid, used as an internal control to normalize for variations in transfection efficiency. Bluescribe M13+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used as a carrier to adjust the total amount of DNA. The cells were washed three times after the transfection. The cellular extracts were prepared by use of reporter lysis buffer (Promega) and subjected to CAT assay after normalizing luciferase activity. CAT activity was determined by autoradiography of thin-layer chromatography plates following completion of the CAT reaction by using an equivalent concentration ofd-threo-dichloroacetyl-1-[14C]chloramphenicol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Japan) as described previously (35Gorman C.M.

Also, the corresponding sense oligonucleotides were prepared and used as a control. We were interested in determining whether SMase regulates gene expression of RAR and RXR subclasses (α, β, and γ) in osteoblastic cells. Thus, first, we examined by Northern blot assay the expression of these genes in cells treated with SMase. Fig. 1 A illustrates the kinetics of the expression of these genes. SMase strongly stimulated the expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes as early as 1 h after the initiation of the treatment but did not affect the levels of the other subclasses. And, as shown in Fig. 1 B, SMase-stimulated expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cells was dose-dependent. These results thus showed that SMase selectively stimulated the expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in MC3T3-E1 cells. Ceramide, generated by the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin with SMase, acts as a second messenger in several cells in response to various stimuli (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Thus, using cell-permeable C2- and C6-ceramide, we investigated whether these ceramides also stimulated the expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cells. As shown in Fig.2 (A and B), C2- and C6-ceramides also stimulated the expression of the α gene of both nuclear receptors in a dose-dependent manner. These ceramides did not have any effect on the gene expression of the β and γ subclasses (data not shown). Taken together with the results described in Fig. 1, these results suggest that SMase stimulates the expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cells through ceramide action. With respect to the SMase pathway, several studies (1Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 1269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 2Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Spiegel S. Merrill Jr., A.H. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1388-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) have shown that ceramide displays several of its biological activities via a SPP-dependent pathway. Therefore, we next addressed whether ceramide-stimulated expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cell was SPP-dependent. We used DHS, which is a potent inhibitor of sphingosine kinase, to examine the effect of kinase inhibition on ceramide-stimulated expression of these genes in the cells. The C2-ceramide stimulation was eliminated by DHS in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, A and B). Because these results suggested the involvement of SPP in ceramide-stimulated expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cells, in addition, we examined whether SPP itself induces actually stimulated these genes. Fig. 3 C shows that SPP also was a potent stimulator of the expression of these genes in the cells. On the other hand, SPP did not have any effect on the gene expression of other RAR and RXR subclasses (data not shown). To confirm this SPP-stimulated expression of RAR-α and RXR-α genes in the cells, we analyzed by Western blot assay whether SPP also stimulated their expression at the protein level. As shown in Fig. 4 (Aand B), our Western blot assay showed that SPP clearly increased the expression of these receptor proteins. Although the data are not shown, control antibody (normal rabbit serum) did not recognize any bands in the blot assay. Several studies (24Lohnes D. Kastner P. Dierich A. Mark M. LeMeur M. Chambon P.

RAR-RXR heterodimers bind efficiently to the DR-5 sequence that contains two copies of AGGTCA as a direct repeat separated by five nucleotides and promote transcriptional activation in a ligand-dependent manner. SPP stimulation of RAR-α and RXR-α expressions in the cells suggested to us that SPP is able to stimulate binding of nuclear protein to DR-5. To explore this possibility, using the gel mobility shift assay, we examined the binding activity of nuclear proteins toward DR-5 in SPP-treated cells. As expected, SPP stimulated the binding activity of the nuclear proteins in a dose-dependent fashion. This stimulatory binding was completely prevented by an unlabeled DR-5 used as a competitor (Fig.5 A). To confirm that SPP stimulation of the binding activity was due to RAR-α and RXR-α, we investigated the specificity by the gel mobility shift assay with specific antibodies to each receptor. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the DNA-protein complexes were shifted to a position indicating slower migration when the nuclear extracts were treated with specific antibody against each receptor. However, such a shift in the DNA-protein complex was not detected when control rabbit serum was used. Thus, these observations strongly suggest that SPP stimulates the binding of RAR-α and RXR-α contained in the nuclear protein preparation to DR-5. Because SPP stimulation of RAR-α and RXR-α binding to DR-5 suggested to us that the sphingosine metabolite also may be able to stimulate the transcriptional activity of RAR-RXR heterodimers in a ligand (RA)-dependent manner, we explored this point by using the transient CAT assay on cells transfected with plasmids containing the DR-5-CAT reporter gene (pDR-5-β-globulin-CAT). As expected, in the presence of RA at the doses tested, SPP significantly stimulated the CAT activity of RAR-RXR heterodimers in the cells (Fig. 6,A and B). However, the significant stimulation of CAT activity was not observed in the cells transfected with β-globulin-CAT reporter plasmid (pβ-globulin-CAT, data not shown). Several studies (1Hannun Y.A. J.

Even though the arrangement of helices among peroxidases resembles each other from fungi to plants, the detailed structures of the active sites as well as the catalytic features of peroxidases differ significantly. The crystal structures of ARP (Coprinus cinereus peroxidase) and LiP are highly similar, exhibiting 1.25 Å root mean square difference in Cα atoms; nevertheless, the substrate specificity and optimal pH are considerably different (3Poulos T.L.

Extensive studies on the structure-function relationship, especially the elucidation of substrate binding sites and detailed binding mechanisms, would be a key to better understand the catalytic mechanism of peroxidases. From the inhibitory damage to the heme of HRP, it has been suggested that the binding sites of the aromatic substrates are located near the heme in the vicinity of the δ-meso carbon and 8-methyl group of the heme (15Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1542-1551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16DePillis G.D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7947-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This region is exposed to solvent in many peroxidases. Very recently, the substrate oxidation sites of LiP were suggested by utilizing a surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (17Johjima T. Itoh N. Kabuto M. Tokimura F. Nakagawa T. Wariishi H. Tanaka H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1989-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and a site-directed mutagenesis technique (18Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). However, limited information on the substrate binding mode hampered the explanation of these results. The substrates for most plant and fungal peroxidases are small molecules such as aromatics, organic acids, halides, and metal complexes. Elucidation of the binding modes of such small molecules to peroxidases, except for a few examples, has not been successful because of their weak binding. Benzhydroxamic acid (BHA) is known to form kinetically tight complexes with most peroxidases, in particular with HRP isozyme C (19Schonbaum G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 502-511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystallographic analyses of ARP-BHA complex (20Itakura H. Oda Y. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and HRP isozyme C-BHA complex (21Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) showed unequivocally how BHA binds to the distal pocket in both enzymes. The hydrophilic portion of BHA forms hydrogen bonds to the distal catalytic His and Arg and to backbone oxygen of Pro in ARP. The hydrogen bonds to these residues were also observed in HRP isozyme C-BHA complex, although the side chain atom of Arg involved in the hydrogen bond differs from that in ARP. A large reorientation of Phe68 near the access channel upon BHA binding was exhibited in HRP isozyme C (21Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), which may account for extraordinary high affinity of BHA to the enzyme. Recently, the binding mode of salicylhydroxamic acid to ARP was reported to be very similar to that of BHA to ARP (22Tsukamoto K. Itakura H. Sato K. Fukuyama K. Miura S. Takahashi S. Ikezawa H. Hosoya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12558-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ARP-iodide complex prepared by the soaking method showed that a single iodide ion is located at the entrance of the access channel to the distal pocket and lies 12.8 Å apart from the heme iron (23Fukuyama K. Sato K. Itakura H. Takahashi S. Hosoya T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5752-5756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the binding site of iodide is different from that of BHA. For HRP, the binding mode of the naturally occurring substrate, ferulic acid, to the enzyme-CN complex was recently reported, indicating the involvement of the distal Arg in the stabilization of substrate binding (24Henriksen A. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 35005-35011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the binding mode of the oxidizing substrate to peroxidases is still unclear. In the present work, we have found that hydroxylamine (HA) specifically binds to ARP during the course of surveying other organic substrate analogues bound to ARP. HA is an interesting probe to characterize the substrate binding site, because its structure resembles the hydrophilic moiety of BHA (Scheme FS1). In addition, because the molecular size and shape of HA somewhat resembles H2O2, the binding mode of this small compound to ARP may suggest the binding mode of H2O2 to peroxidases. Therefore, we investigated in more detail the inhibitory effect and binding mode of HA using kinetic, spectroscopic, and x-ray crystallographic techniques. Here, we report that HA is located between the distal His and heme iron and that it directly binds to the heme iron, causing a competitive inhibition against the oxidizing substrate. ARP was isolated from the extracellular culture medium of A. ramosus as described previously (25Kunishima N. Fukuyama K. Wakabayashi S. Sumida M. Takaya M. Shibano Y. Amachi T. Matsubara H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). All the purified proteins exhibited a single peak on Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) chromatography. The sample had an RZ value (A 403/A 280) of 2.5. The concentration of ARP was determined using ε405 of 109 mm−1 cm−1 (26Andersen M.B. Hsuanyu Y. Welinder K.G. Schneider P. Dunford H.B. Acta Chem. Scand. 1991; 45: 1080-1086Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The enzyme was crystallized as described previously (25Kunishima N. Fukuyama K. Wakabayashi S. Sumida M. Takaya M. Shibano Y. Amachi T. Matsubara H. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1993; 15: 216-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The crystals of ARP in complex with HA were prepared by soaking the native ARP crystals for 5 h in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.6, containing 20 mm HA and 35% saturated ammonium sulfate. Its crystals belong to space group P42212 witha = b = 74.4 Å and c = 117.5 Å, and are isomorphous to the native ARP crystals. HA (50% solution) was obtained from Aldrich. BHA and H2O2 (30% solution) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals. ABTS was purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Deionized water was prepared using Milli Q system (Millipore). HA concentration of the stock solution was determined daily using 8-quinolinol (Wako Pure Chemicals) (27Berg R. Becker E. Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges. Berlin. 1940; 73B: 172-173Crossref Google Scholar, 28Frear D.S. Burrell R.C. Anal. Chem. 1955; 27: 1664-1665Crossref Scopus (261) Google Scholar). 8-Quinolinol was recrystalized from ethanol/hexane before use. UV-visible absorption spectra were recorded using Perkin-Elmer Lambda 19 spectrophotometer at room temperature. To measure difference spectra, both the reference and sample cuvettes contained ARP (3 μm). HA was added only to the sample cuvette, and difference spectra in the range of 350–500 nm were determined at pH 5–8 (200 mm succinate or 100 mm phosphate). The ionic strength was adjusted to 400 mm using potassium sulfate. The apparent dissociation constants (K D) were calculated from the plot of ΔA versus [HA] where ΔA is the difference between maximum and minimum absorption. The number of binding sites near the heme was calculated from ΔA of the difference spectra using Hill plot as described (29Wariishi H. Valli K. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23688-23695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rate of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) and ABTS oxidation was determined at 469 nm using ε of 49.6 mm−1 cm−1 (29Wariishi H. Valli K. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 23688-23695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 36.8 mm−1 cm−1 at 414 nm (30Smith A.T. Sanders S.A. Thorneley R.N.F. Burke J.F. Bray R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 207: 507-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), respectively. Reaction mixtures contained ARP (0.3 nmfor ABTS or 10 nm for the others), H2O2 (50–800 μm), DMP (0–20 mm), or ABTS (50–300 μm) in 50 mm phosphate, pH 7.0. The reaction was initiated by the addition of H2O2. 1/initial rateversus 1/[H2O2], 1/[DMP], or 1/[ABTS] was determined at various fixed concentrations of HA (0–400 μm). Resonance Raman (RR) spectra were obtained on a SpectraPro-300i (Acton Research Co.) spectrograph (operating at 3600-groove grating) using a Spectra-Physics Beamlok 2060 Kr ion laser (413.1 nm), a Kaiser Optical holographic supernotch filter, and a Prinston Instruments (LN-1100PB) liquid N2-cooled CCD detector. Incident laser power at the sample was 15 mW. Spectra were collected in a 90° scattering geometry from solution samples contained in glass spinning cell (2-cm diameter, 1500 rpm) tubes for 5 min at room temperature. Spectral resolution was set to 3 cm−1. Peak frequencies were calibrated relative to indene and accurate to ± 0.1 cm−1. During Raman experiments, UV-visible spectra were simultaneously collected on Photal MCPD-2000 diode array spectrometer with Photal MC-2530 as a light source. Data were calibrated and analyzed with GRAMS/386 spectroscopic software (Galactic Industries Corp.). The concentration of ARP for RR studies was 100 μm in 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence or absence of 100 mmHA. Diffraction data on the complex crystal were collected at room temperature on an R-AXIS IV imaging plate area detector. CuKα radiation from a Rigaku rotating anode generator was monochromatized with nickel-filter and focused with double-bent mirrors. The diffraction data recorded in each imaging plate were read out at 100-μm intervals and then processed using PROCESS (31Higashi T. PROCESS: A Program for Indexing and Processing R-AXIS IIc Imaging Data. Rigaku Corp., Tokyo1990Google Scholar). Intensities of the partial reflections recorded on two adjacent imaging plates were combined to obtain the integrated intensities.

Matsubara H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) were used for the structural refinement, several water molecules near the heme being excluded. The parameters were refined using the observed diffraction data of the complex by the program XPLOR (33Brünger A.T. XPLOR , version 3.0. Yale University, New Heaven, CT1992Google Scholar). The locations of water molecules were revised by alternate cycles of XPLOR refinement and inspection of the (2F o − F c) and (F o − F c) maps with TURBO-FRODO (34Roussel A. Cambillau C.

The (2F o − F c) and (F o − F c) maps, in whichF c and the phase angles were calculated with the resulting parameters, clearly showed electron density ascribable to the HA molecule. A HA model was fitted manually to the maps. The final model contains 211 water molecules in addition to the protein and HA. The results of crystallographic refinement are shown in Table I. There is no unusual conformation as indicated by the Ramachandran plot. The atomic parameters have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (code1C8I). Upon the addition of the excess HA to native ARP, the Soret peak was shifted from 403 to 414.5 nm with a change in the visible region (500 to 540 and 570 nm), suggesting the occurrence of a change in heme environment (Fig.1). The Soret peak of HA complex was not shifted in the pH range of 5–8 and was stable for several hours at room temperature. ARP bound HA to produce characteristic difference spectra, exhibiting a maximum at 417 nm and a minimum at 387 nm (Fig. 1, inset). The apparent dissociation constants (K D app) were calculated from the following equation,ΔA=(ΔA∞·[S])/(KD app+[S])Equation 1 where ΔA ∞ is the absorbance change for the complete formation of the adduct and [S] is the free HA concentration, which is assumed to be equal to the initial concentration. K D app and ΔA ∞ could be evaluated from the nonlinear least squares fit to the data using Equation 1.K D app was calculated to be 6.2 ± 0.1 mm at pH 7.0. Stoichiometry of HA binding to ARP in the vicinity of the heme was estimated from the logarithmic form of the Hill equation shown below,log[ΔA/(ΔA∞−ΔA)]=h·log [S]+log KD appEquation 2 where ΔA ∞ andK D app were calculated from Equation 1. A plot of log [ΔA/(ΔA ∞ − ΔA)] against log [S] exhibited a straight line with a slope (h, Hill coefficient) of 0.99, suggesting the binding of single HA to the native enzyme near the heme. However, a possible binding of other HA molecule(s), which is too far from the heme to affect the Soret absorption, could not be omitted. If HA acts as a substrate analogue, it should inhibit the normal catalytic reaction of ARP. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of HA against either oxidizing substrate or reducing substrates was studied using steady state kinetics. To avoid the kinetic complication, the concentration of one substrate was fixed in excess (at least twice as much asK m). The family of plots, 1/v versus 1/[H2O2], 1/[DMP], or 1/[ABTS] at various fixed concentrations of HA intercepted on the ordinate. Furthermore, a linear relationship of the secondary plot, slope versus [HA] demonstrated competitive inhibition, from which K i was calculated (TableII). Comparing these data with theK D app value, it is concluded that HA is a true competitive inhibitor for H2O2, because K i andK D app values sit in the same range. HA also acts as an inhibitor for the oxidation of DMP and ABTS, but the inhibition against those reducing substrates occurred with very smallK i values (Table II). HA may act as an apparent competitive inhibitor against DMP and ABTS, probably because HA binding might influence the electron transfer reaction for the oxidation of those reducing substrates. The type of inhibition was somehow different for DMP and ABTS, which might suggest that the binding sites for these two substrates are different. DMP is a phenolic compound so that it is neutral at neutral pH. On the other hand, because of the sulfonate group, ABTS shows a strong anionic character at neutral pH. Very recently, it has been reported that ABTS and other anionic substrates have different oxidation sites on the LiP protein from its preferable substrate oxidation site such as veratryl alcohol (18Doyle W.A. Blodig W. Veitch N.C. Piontek K. Smith A.T. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15097-15105Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). 2T. Johjima, H. Wariishi, and H. Tanaka, submitted for publication. Importantly, for ARP, HA acts as a competitive inhibitor against H2O2, which strongly supports the possibility that HA may directly interact with the heme iron.Table IIInhibition pattern of HA and BHA against ARP reactionsInhibitorSubstrateType of inhibitionK iHAH2O2Competitive2.46 mmDMPCompetitive184 μmABTSMixed215 μmBHAH2O2Noncompetitive171 μmDMPNoncompetitive44.4 μm Open table in a new tab Because a RR spectral method is very sensitive to the change in spin and coordination states of heme iron, an RR spectrum of ARP-HA was compared with that of native ARP. Fig. 2 shows the RR spectra in the high frequency region for the native ferric ARP and ARP-HA complex with Soret excitation. The RR bands of the native ARP at 1371, 1494, 1567, and 1625 cm−1 are identical to previously reported RR bands for C. cinereus peroxidase (36Smulevich G. Neri F. Marzocchi M.P. Welinder K.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10576-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In that study, it was also mentioned that C. cinereus peroxidase was found to be unstable in the laser beam. However, in the present study, ARP was stable to exhibit the above mentioned native ferric marker bands for several hours even at room temperature and using a higher laser power of 15 mW. We believe that it might be caused by the difference in the efficiency of rotary cells for the measurement but not by the difference in the enzyme samples. Upon the addition of HA, the marker bands indicative of hexacoordinate low spin heme appeared (ν3 at 1504 cm−1, ν2 at 1575 cm−1, and ν10 at 1636 cm−1) that were almost identical to the hexacoordinate low spin marker bands previously reported (36Smulevich G. Neri F. Marzocchi M.P. Welinder K.G. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10576-10585Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the ferric marker band at 1371 cm−1 and ν(C=C) at 1625 cm−1 were not shifted. We reported that the binding of ammonia to the heme iron of ARP (32Kunishima N. Amada F. Fukuyama K. Kawamoto M. Matsunaga T. Matsubara H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the direct interaction of HA is not surprising. K D app for HA binding to ARP was calculated over the pH range of 5–8 as described above. Plots ofK D app against pH are shown in Fig.3. Above pH 5,K D app decreased with increasing pH, indicating pH-dependent binding of HA to ARP and better binding at higher pH. Possible ionizable group(s) controlling the pH dependence observed in the pH range for this experiment could be the amino group of HA and/or the amino acid residue(s) in heme pocket of ARP. In the distal pocket, there are two ionizable amino acid residues, His56 (distal His) and Arg52. The pK a of the distal His in C. cinereusperoxidase has been reported to be lower than 1 (37Abelskov A.K. Smith A.T. Rasmussen C.B. Dunford H.B. Welinder K.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9453-9463Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The pK a of Arg seemed to be out of the range utilized here. To simplify the equation for pH dependence of HA binding to the heme of ARP, the ionization of amino acid residues in the distal pocket were omitted, and the binding form of HA was assumed to be NH2OH because of the better binding at higher pH (Fig. 3). Then the binding equation could be described using Equations 3 and4, NH2OH+E ⇄Ka E−NH2OHEquation 3 NH2OH+H+ ⇄Ka (HA) N+H3OHEquation 4 Ka=[E][NH2OH]/[E−NH2OH]Equation 5 Ka (HA)=[NH2OH][H+]/[N+H3OH]Equation 6 KD app=Ka(1+[H+])/Ka(HA)Equation 7 where K a is a pH-independent dissociation constant and K a (HA) is the acid dissociation constant. Then, K D app can be expressed as Equation 7. The pK a (HA) value was calculated to be 6.0 ± 0.1 from the Equation 7 using nonlinear least squares fit to the data (Fig. 3), which exhibited a good agreement with the reported value of 5.5 for HA (38Ignatenko V.E. Marshakov A.I. Chebotaryova N.P. Comizzol R.B. Frankent R.P. Sinclair J.D. Proceedings of the Third International Symposium on Corrosion and Reliability of Electronic Materials and Devices. Electrochemical Society, Pennington, NJ1994: 392-401Google Scholar). K a was calculated to be 5.5 × 10−3m. As mentioned above, electron absorption and RR spectral characteristics of ARP-HA complex indicated a much clearer feature of hexacoordinate low spin species, suggesting the direct interaction of HA with heme iron. This result poses the next question. Which atom, nitrogen or oxygen of HA, directly interacts with heme iron? This pH dependence observation may provide important information. Because the ionization of HA affected its binding, the nitrogen atom of HA might directly interact with the heme iron. It could be tentatively concluded that the nitrogen atom of HA is likely to be coordinated to the heme iron. This direct interaction of the nitrogen atom and the heme iron could be supported by the previous observation that pH-dependent binding of ammonia derived from ammonium sulfate to the heme iron of ARP (32Kunishima N. Amada F. Fukuyama K. Kawamoto M. Matsunaga T. Matsubara H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, the binding efficiency was much higher with HA than ammonia when their K D values were compared. The ARP crystal soaked in HA solution was isomorphous with the native crystal. No significant change in the conformation of the main chain and side chains of ARP was observed upon the binding of HA, unlike in HRP, where a large reorientation of Phe68 occurred upon the addition of BHA (21Henriksen A. Schuller D.J. Meno K. Welinder K.G. Smith A.T. Gajhede M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8054-8060Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The difference Fourier map (Fig. 4) exhibits the significant electron density at the distal heme pocket between heme iron and the distal His. Since the experimental conditions taken in the present crystallographic study (pH 5.6), ammonia derived from ammonium sulfate does not bind to ARP (32Kunishima N. Amada F. Fukuyama K. Kawamoto M. Matsunaga T. Matsubara H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the electron density observed in ARP-HA complex (Fig. 4) is most likely caused by exogenously added HA. Furthermore, all the data obtained from spectral and kinetic experiments indicated the occurrence of the direct interaction of HA with the heme iron. We assumed that the nitrogen atom of HA binds to the heme iron. Although the current resolution of the x-ray analysis is marginal to define the orientation of HA, HA was nearly parallel to the heme plane. The electron density corresponding to water molecule was not seen near the distal His of ARP-HA complex; although it was clearly seen in the native ARP (32Kunishima N. Amada F. Fukuyama K. Kawamoto M. Matsunaga T. Matsubara H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 378: 291-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The distal water molecule may be replaced by HA. As the deviation from the spherical shape of the density was insignificant at the current resolution of 2 Å, the HA model fitted to the density is tentative in its orientation. The current binding mode of HA to ARP is shown in Fig.5. The nitrogen atom is coordinated to heme iron (2.5 Å), and the hydroxyl group is involved in a hydrogen bond with the distal His56 (2.8 Å). The distance between HA and Arg52 is too far (>4 Å) to form a hydrogen bond.Figure 5Binding mode of HA to ARP. Dashed lines show possible hydrogen bond and interaction to the heme iron.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crystal structure of ARP-BHA complex reported by Itakura et al. (20Itakura H. Oda Y. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggests that one of the major factors controlling the binding mode of BHA with ARP is the hydrogen bonding network caused by the side chain functional groups and distal amino acid residues. Although HA possesses similar functional groups to those of BHA, it binds to ARP in a totally different way (Fig. 5). The difference between HA and BHA is whether they contain aromatic moiety or not (Scheme FS1). Therefore, the comparison of the binding modes of HA and BHA to ARP would provide an important information on the binding site for aromatic substrates. Presumably, the aromatic moiety of BHA plays a more important role in its binding to ARP. The role of aromatic moiety of BHA seems to be the hydrophobic interaction with hydrophobic amino acid residues of ARP. The aromatic ring of BHA is surrounded by Pro91, Gly94, Ile153, Gly155, Pro156, Gly191, Leu192, and Phe230 (20Itakura H. Oda Y. Fukuyama K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues form a hydrophobic circle, likely providing hydrophobic interaction with other hydrophobic compounds like aromatics. Therefore, BHA was fixed near the entrance of the distal heme pocket, whereas HA was not trapped by these hydrophobic residues and directly binds to the heme iron. The involvement of those hydrophobic amino acid residues was recently suggested from the molecular dynamic calculation for the binding of a series of aromatic substrates to ARP (22Tsukamoto K. Itakura H. Sato K. Fukuyama K. Miura S. Takahashi S. Ikezawa H. Hosoya T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12558-12568Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The direct binding of HA to the heme iron resulted in the competitive inhibition against the reaction of H2O2 with native ARP. On the other hand, BHA caused noncompetitive inhibition against the reaction of H2O2 with native ARP (Table II), probably because the distal entrance for H2O2 was concealed. Furthermore, the size of the distal entrance of ARP is the largest among fungal peroxidases whose crystal structures have been clarified (3Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kunishima N. Fukuyama K. Matsubara H. Hatanaka H. Shibano Y. Amachi T. J. Mol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 32759-32767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The broad substrate specificity of ARP would be explained by a loose aromatic binding site. The interaction of HA with the heme iron of LiP and manganese peroxidase occurred, whereas no spectral shift was observed upon the addition of HA to HRP (data not shown). Because the distal entrance of HRP is definitely larger than LiP and manganese peroxidase (3Poulos T.L. Edwards S.L. Wariishi H. Gold M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4429-4440Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Sundaramoorthy M. Kishi K. Gold H.M. Poulos T.L. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 4: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar), the binding features of HA to the heme iron of peroxidases cannot be explained by the size of the distal entrance. So far, the direct interaction of HA to the heme iron was observed with fungal peroxidases. Although further studies would be required, HA may be an interesting probe to analyze the distal environment of peroxidases. The molecular size and shape of HA resembles H2O2(Scheme FS1). It has been very difficult to characterize the complex between native peroxidase and H2O2, which was retarded by a fast reaction of the heterolytic cleavage of peroxide by peroxidases to form compound I species. The binding mode of this small compound to ARP may suggest the binding mode of H2O2 to peroxidases. Because HA acts as a competitive inhibitor against H2O2 and directly binds to heme iron in the distal pocket, ARP-HA complex may serve as a compound 0 model. Compound 0 was proposed to be a hyperporphyrin formed by deprotonation of an H2O2-peroxidase (ferric heme iron) complex (39Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 5714-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 40Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 718-725Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 41Ozaki S. Inada Y. Watanabe Y. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 8020-8025Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The cryoenzymological technique was utilized, showing that this intermediate exhibits Soret bands at 360 and 410 nm and a weak band in the visible near 570 nm (40Baek H.K. Van Wart H.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 718-725Crossref Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In the present study, HA-ARP complex exhibits absorption bands at 360, 414.5, 540, and 570 nm. The hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group of HA and the distal His56 may facilitate the deprotonation of HA. Further spectroscopic and kinetic studies as well as high resolution x-ray analysis to clarify the role of HA in the catalytic action are now under way. A number of works have been directed toward elucidating the substrate binding sites of many peroxidases (15Ator M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Because HA is such a small compound, x-ray was insufficient to identify the electron density observed upon the addition of HA to ARP. We combined kinetic, spectroscopic, and x-ray crystallographic techniques to probe the heme environment and the binding mode of HA to ARP. Comparison of the binding modes of HA and BHA to ARP suggested the binding site for aromatic substrates. In addition, from the similarity of molecular size and shape of HA with those of H2O2 and the binding mode of HA to ARP, we proposed HA-ARP complex as the structural model for peroxidase compound 0."

These can lead to mutations during replication of the damaged DNA. A network of DNA repair pathways and checkpoint responses minimize this risk. Both prokaryotes and eukaryotes are also endowed with DNA damage tolerance pathways that increase survival by facilitating the duplication of the genome, even in the presence of unrepaired lesions. These pathways include lesion bypass during semi-conservative DNA synthesis by mechanisms that are not yet completely understood (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis.

This DNA polymerase together with Rev1p, a primer-template-dependent deoxycytidyltransferase (6Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

Also cloned recently were the human homolog of E. coli dinB (23Gerlach V.L. Aravind L. Gotway G. Schultz R.A. Koonin E.V. Friedberg E.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The latter is distinct from pol η (hRAD30A) but appears to encode also a bypass DNA polymerase, pol ι (26Hubscher U. Nasheuer H.P. Syvaoja J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 143-147Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Whether these novel DNA polymerases contribute to the bypass of different DNA lesions is still under investigation. The preferred model of lesion bypass during DNA replication calls for a step of translesion synthesis catalyzed by one of the novel DNA polymerases described above (9Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12224-12226Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). One characteristic of these new enzymes is that they synthesize DNA with low processivity (27Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36835-36838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and low fidelity (27Washington M.T. Johnson R.E. Prakash S. Prakash L.

Nature. 2000; 404: 1011-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This suggests that the bypass polymerases might replace the replicative polymerase blocked at the damage site, catalyze the addition of a few nucleotides across the lesion (their active sites are thought to be more tolerant of DNA distortions), and then dissociate from the primer-template (27Washington M.T.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 3094-3099PubMed Google Scholar). At this point, the main replicase would return to the DNA growing point for efficient (processive and faithful) duplication of the undamaged DNA (9Woodgate R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2191-2195Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 10Johnson R.E. Washington M.T. Prakash S. Prakash L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

An alternative model of lesion bypass calls for the melting from the damaged template of the 3′ end of the blocked strand and re-annealing to the complementary nascent DNA strand (copy choice). This template-switching model was first proposed by Higgins et al. (30Higgins N.P. Kato K. Strauss B. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 101: 417-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and Fujiwara and Tatsumi (31Fujiwara Y. Tatsumi M. Mutat. Res. 1976; 37: 91-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) to explain bypass replication of UV-induced lesions in irradiated human cells. Such a damage-avoidance mechanism has been proposed to operate in bacteria (32Koffel-Schwartz N. Coin F. Veaute X. Fuchs R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7805-7810Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) and yeast (33Baynton K. Bresson-Roy A. Fuchs R.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 960-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). There is strong evidence that bypass polymerases, such as pol ζ (5Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W. Hinkle D.C.

However, the possibility that template switching might occur during the replication of a duplex DNA, when the synthesis of both leading and lagging strands takes place, has not been formally excluded. The template-switching model did not receive much attention until recent years because it was assumed that interruption of leading strand synthesis by a template lesion would result in complete blockage of the replication fork (35Meneghini R. Hanawalt P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 425: 428-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Cordeiro-Stone M. Schumacher R.I. Meneghini R. Biophys. J. 1979; 27: 287-300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Studies using in vitroreplication of duplex DNA, however, has provided evidence that uncoupling of leading and lagging strand synthesis occurs when leading strand synthesis is blocked by a template lesion (37Thomas D.C.

Under these conditions, the replication fork continues to move beyond the damaged site, extending the lagging strand by 1 to 2 thousand nucleotides beyond the lesion (40Cordeiro-Stone M.

These findings, as well as evidence that extended single-stranded DNA regions are also formed during DNA replication in UV-irradiated mammalian cells (42Lehmann A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 66: 319-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 43Meneghini R. Cordeiro-Stone M. Schumacher R.I. Biophys. J. 1981; 33: 81-92Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), suggested that a template-switching mechanism was indeed quite plausible. The appeal of such a lesion bypass pathway was its potential for high fidelity and for being independent of the nature of the blocking lesion. In this study we designed and carried out experiments to determine whether translesion synthesis or template-strand switching is the primary mechanism by which a site-specific thymine dimer is bypassed during in vitro replication of a duplex DNA. Heteroduplex circular molecules with or without a single cis,syn-thymine dimer [T∧T] on the template to the leading strand and a mismatch on the complementary template were fully methylated at CpG islands and replicated in vitro by several bypass-proficient human cell extracts. Leading strand was successfully distinguished from the lagging strand and methylated template strands by methylation-specific PCR, after the DNA was treated with bisulfite. Sequencing of cloned PCR products revealed that translesion synthesis, and not template switching, was the major mechanism by which cis, syn-thymine dimers were bypassed during in vitroreplication. HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center Tissue Culture Facility (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill) or from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). The IDH4 cell line was a gift from Dr. Jerry Shay (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center). This cell line was generated by transformation with SV40 large T antigen of fibroblasts from an apparently normal human fetus (44Shay J.W. West M.D. Wright W.E. Exp.

Cells were grown in monolayer cultures at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. HCT116 cells were maintained in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories). The other cell lines were grown in Eagle's minimal essential medium, supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine and 10% fetal bovine serum. Growth medium for IDH4 cells also contained 1 μm dexamethasone (Sigma). Replication-competent cell extracts for DNA replication in vitro were prepared as published (47Li J.J. Kelly T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6973-6977Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 48Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Methods Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 295-313Google Scholar). The base changes required for the formation of the mismatch in the final heteroduplex (Fig. 1) were introduced in the sequence of the + strand of M13LeaSV (40Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Mutated + strands for the construction of Lea-C and T∧T-C were prepared essentially as described (40Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), except that the 20-mer inserted into M13mp2SV (49Roberts J.D. Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) was changed by a single base (5′-GAGCTCA C TTAGTCAGCTGC-3′). The mutated + strand in Lea-munI and T∧T-munI were produced with the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The 35-bp oligonucleotides 5′-CCGGCTCGAGCTCAATT G GTCAGCTGCGTATGTTG-3′ and 5′-CAACATACGCAGCTGAC C AATTGAGCTCGAGCCGG-3′ containing a point mutation at position 389 (bold and underlined) were used to introduce a unique MunI site into M13LeaSV. Mutated products were verified by sequencing of the + strands. Mutated closed circular single-stranded DNA was purified and annealed with the oligonucleotide 3′-CTCGAGT∧TAATCAGTCGACG-5′ previously phosphorylated at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase (40Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Then, second-strand synthesis, ligation, and purification in CsCl gradients were carried out according to published procedure (51Huang J.C. Svoboda D.L. Reardon J.T. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3664-3668Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Control heteroduplex molecules (Lea-munI and Lea-C) were prepared in the same manner, using an oligonucleotide of identical sequence, but without the thymine dimer. Heteroduplex DNA molecules were incubated with the bacterial SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) for 2–3 h at 37 °C, under conditions suggested by the enzyme supplier for methylation of CpG sites. Complete methylation was confirmed by resistance of the closed circular heteroduplex molecules to digestion by AciI (New England Biolabs), a restriction enzyme that cuts only unmethylated DNA. In vitro replication of the methylated heteroduplexes was carried out in 25-μl reactions, as described previously (40Cordeiro-Stone M. Zaritskaya L.S. Price L.K. Kaufmann W.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13945-13954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), except that the concentration of dCTP was reduced to 50 μm. Reaction mixtures lacking SV40 large T antigen were used as negative controls of in vitro DNA replication. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of stop solution containing 2% SDS, 2 mg/ml proteinase K, and 50 mm EDTA. DNA was purified by using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction System (Qiagen). In experiments with T∧T-munI and Lea-munI, the purified replication products were digested withMunI (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2–3 h at 37 °C. Aliquots of purified DNA samples (∼10 ng) were fractionated in 1% agarose gels containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Dried gels were exposed to a phosphor screen that was later scanned by a PhosphorImagerTM (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Several protocols for bisulfite conversion of cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA have been described (52Frommer M. McDonald L.E. Millar D.S. Collis C.M. Watt F. Grigg G.W. Molloy P.L.

In order to achieve efficient bisulfite conversion, the purified DNA was first digested with XmnI restriction endonuclease (New England Biolabs) for 2–3 h at 37 °C. There are two XmnI recognition sequences in the heteroduplex DNA used in these experiments (Fig. 1). The restricted DNA (18 μl, ∼30 ng) was denatured by incubation in 0.3 m NaOH (addition of 2 μl of freshly prepared 3 m NaOH) for 15 min at 37 °C. Then, 200 μl of freshly prepared 5 m bisulfite solution, pH 5.0 (a mixture of 2.5 m metabisulfite and 500 mm hydroquinone; Sigma), was added to each reaction tube, followed by an incubation of 4 h at 50 °C. The bisulfite-treated DNA was desalted by using the Wizard® DNA clean-up system (Promega) and desulfonated by addition of 3 m NaOH to a final concentration of 0.3 m. After 15 min at 37 °C, the solution was neutralized by addition of 7.5 mNH4Oac, pH 7.0, to a final concentration of 3m. DNA was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in 12 μl of 10 mm Tris, containing 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and used immediately or stored at −20 °C. The list of primers used in this study is shown in Table I. Primers were designed for both 5′→3′ and 3′→5′ strands. Strand-specific primers for the selective amplification of the replicated DNA (UNMET) or the methylated template (MET), nonselective primers, and the sequencing primer were designed using the GCG sequence analysis software package of the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (version 7). Primers were synthesized at the Pathology Oligonucleotide Synthesis Facility (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill).Figure 1Schematic representation of the two constructs used as substrates for in vitro DNA replication.

The location of the T∧T relative to the SV40 origin of replication placed the dimer on the template to the leading strand for the first replication fork to encounter the lesion. In T∧T-C, a mismatched C was placed opposite the 5′-T of the dimer. In T∧T-munI, a G:T mismatch was placed 3 bp downstream from the dimer to create aMunI recognition site upon replication of the undamaged strand.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IPrimer sets for methylation-specific PCR amplification of DNA strands from replicated duplex DNA (see Figs. 1 and 3D)PrimersAmplified DNA strandForward primers 5′→3′Reverse primers 5′→3′Product lengthOptimal annealing temperature°C1) 5′–3′-METTemplateCGTAAAT CGTTTTTTTT CACACCGCTTCTAATACC43650.42) 3′–5′-METTemplateATGGGCGTATCGTAATCGAACTAAAAACGAACAATAAAC46151.73) 5′–3′-UNMETLeadingTATGGGG T GGAGAATGGG TC A CAACTATTAAAAAAAAC A ATC A AT A C A57052.04) 3′–5′-UNMETLaggingGTG T GGGTTTTTT T GTTATTA T GTCTAAC A CCCAATAC A CAAACC A37551.55) 5′–3′ Non-selectiveTemplate + LeadingTAGGCGGTGAAGGGTAAAATACCGAAAACCAAACAA49551.66) SequencingLeadingCCAACTAAC A AAAAAAAAATATACTACAAAAC AUnderlined nucleotides represent positions protected from deamination by SssI methylation of template DNA but modified by bisulfite treatment in replicated DNA; sequence differences between primers and DNA not treated with bisulfite are in boldface.

PCR was carried out in a TouchdownTM Thermal Cycler with a hot-start step that improved specificity. Reaction mixtures (50 μl) containing 3 μl of bisulfite-treated DNA, 10 pmol of each PCR primer, 10 nm of each dNTP, and buffer supplied by Qiagen were placed in the thermal cycler and hot-started at 94 °C for 4 min. After addition of 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Qiagen) the denaturation step was continued for 2 min, followed by the touchdown protocol (denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing atX °C for 30 s, extension at 72 °C for 30 s). The initial annealing temperature of 61 °C was decreased at the rate of 1 °C for every PCR cycle until the targeted temperature was reached (optimal annealing temperature for the primers used; see TableI). At the target temperature, 19–20 regular PCR cycles were performed, followed by a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. Negative controls for the strand-specific primers were performed with each PCR set. Aliquots (2 μl) of the PCRs were mixed with Ficoll loading buffer (3% Ficoll 400, 25 mm EDTA, 0.025% Orange G) and subjected to electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. For direct sequencing, PCR products were purified using QIAquickTM PCR product purification system (Qiagen). PCR products obtained from 5′→3′ and 3′→5′ strands of template, and replicated DNA was directly sequenced using one of the PCR primers. PCR products obtained from the leading strand of replicated DNA were subcloned using TA Cloning Kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA from individual clones were isolated using WIZARD PLUS Minipreps Kit (Promega), checked for the presence of an insertion, and sequenced using the sequencing primer (Table I). DNA sequencing was done at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Automated DNA Sequencing Facility on a model 377 DNA Sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) using the ABI PRISMTM Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase. The sequence data were analyzed using the GCG sequence analysis software package of the Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (version 7). Two sets of circular heteroduplex DNA molecules were prepared for in vitro DNA replication (T∧T-munI and T∧T-C), each containing a control molecule lacking the T∧T dimer (Lea-munI and Lea-C, respectively). In the T∧T-munI and T∧T-C substrates, the dimer was placed in the template to the leading strand (for the first replication fork encountering the lesion), 385 bp from the center of the SV40 origin of replication (Fig.1). The two constructs differed only in the location of the mismatched bases. In T∧T-munI, a T:G mismatch was at position 389, 3 bp away from the T∧T dimer (3′-T∧TAA T -5′:5′-AATT G -3′). This mismatch created a unique MunI site in the replication product of the undamaged strand, but the replication product of the damaged strand remained resistant to MunI. The"

The placement of the active site-binding groups in MDH effectively discriminates against both the shorter and the longer keto dicarboxylic acids that could potentially serve as alternative substrates. A notable exception to this specificity is the alternative substrate phenylpyruvate. This aromatic keto acid can be reduced by MDH, albeit at a somewhat slower rate and with greatly diminished affinity, despite the presence of several substrate-binding arginyl residues and the absence of a hydrophobic pocket in the active site. The specificity of MDH for phenylpyruvate has now been enhanced, and that for the physiological substrate oxaloacetate has been diminished, through the replacement of one of the binding arginyl residues with several unnatural alkyl and aryl amino acid analogs. This approach, called site-specific modulation, incorporates systematic structural variations at a site of interest. Molecular modeling studies have suggested a structural basis for the affinity of native MDH for phenylpyruvate and a rationale for the improved catalytic activity that is observed with these new, modified phenyllactate dehydrogenases.

This approach combines the strength of site-directed mutagenesis (absolute specificity) with the wide range of structural analogs that can be accessed through chemical modifications. The earlier work in this area focused primarily on the regeneration of lysine analogs to restore activity in aspartase aminotranferase (1Yoshimura T. Soda K. Matsushima Y. Tanizawa K. Sung M.H.

Instead of the limited goal of replacing the target amino acid with an analog that mimics the natural amino acid, the aim of this approach is to systematically alter the enzyme active site groups that are responsible for substrate recognition and binding. In this way new catalysts can be generated with specificities that are designed for reactions of interest. Malate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate (OAA)1 with the concomitant reduction of NAD+ to NADH. This enzyme is highly specific for its natural substrates, malate and OAA, and efficiently discriminates against both shorter and longer dicarboxylic acids. Examination of the crystal structure provides an explanation for the substrate selectivity that is observed with this enzyme (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Both malate and OAA are proposed to be bound at each end through electrostatic interactions between the two substrate carboxyl groups and two arginyl residues (Arg-81 and Arg-153) that are positioned to interact precisely with a four-carbon dicarboxylic acid (Fig. 1). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) are very similar 2-keto acid dehydrogenases that catalyze related reactions by an equivalent mechanism (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 6Grau U.M. Trommer W.E. Rossmann M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 151: 289-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Despite the overall structural similarities the sequence homology between these functionally related enzyme families is quite low. However, the functional active site amino acids are highly conserved between these enzyme families (7Goward C.R. Nicholls D.J. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1883-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). To examine the specificity of LDH the active site, which is normally specific for pyruvate, has been redesigned to use phenylpyruvate as a substrate by mutagenically switching sections of a mobile loop that is responsible for substrate specificity (8Wilks H.M. Moreton K.M. Halsall D.J. Hart K.W. Sessions R.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7802-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Mutagenic replacement of an important active site residue in LDH (Gln-102) has also lead to an enzyme form that will utilize phenylpyruvate, with thek cat/K m for phenylpyruvate improved by a factor of 100 over that of the native enzyme (9el Hawrani A.S. Sessions R.B. Moreton K.M. Holbrook J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 264: 97-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Native MDH has also been shown to be capable of catalyzing the reduction of phenylpyruvate to phenyllactate, although at a rate that is substantially reduced when compared with its physiological substrate OAA (10Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). With the observation that MDH can use phenylpyruvate as an alternative substrate, and starting with the mutagenic studies on LDH, our goal was to expand the redesign options that are available by selectively incorporating unnatural amino acids that could potentially enhance the binding and catalysis of phenylpyruvate, using malate dehydrogenase as a structural scaffold. We report here the use of site-specific modulation to convert malate dehydrogenase into an efficient phenyllactate dehydrogenase. The pEM 6 plasmid containing the mdhgene was a gift from Dr. N.C. Furumo (Eastern Illinois University). All restriction endonucleases and molecular weight markers were purchased from New England Biolabs. Electrophoresis grade agarose was purchased from SeaChem. Primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. Native Pfu DNA polymerase and the polymerase chain reaction optimization kit were purchased from Stratagene. Affi-blue resin was purchased from Bio-Rad. Phenyllactate, 2-bromopropane, 1-bromo-2-methylpropane, benzyl bromide, and 4-fluorobenzyl bromide were obtained from Aldrich. 4-Aminobenzyl alcohol was from Lancaster, and all other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Purification of MDH was performed according to a previously published scheme (11Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. McAllister-Henn L. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The activity of malate dehydrogenase was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring either the formation or the disappearance of NADH (E 340= 6.22 mm−1 cm−1). Standard assay conditions were as follows: 50 mm buffer, 2 mmEDTA, 100 mm KCl, and variable concentrations of the hydroxy or keto acid substrates in the presence of saturating levels of coenzyme (either 0.15 mm NADH or 7 mmNAD+) (12Wright S.K. Zhao F.J. Rardin J. Milbrandt J. Helton M. Furumo N.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Each reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme, and the kinetic data were fitted by using an Enzyme Kinetics software package, adapted from the programs of Cleland (13Cleland W.W. Adv. Enzymol. 1967; 29: 1-32PubMed Google Scholar), to obtain the kinetic parameters. Protein concentration was determined by the Bradford method (14Bradford M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by using recombinant circle polymerase chain reaction (15Tarragona-Fiol A. Eggelte H.J. Harbron S. Sanchez E. Taylorson C.J. Ward J.M. Rabin B.R. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 901-906Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 16Jones D.H. White B.A. PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. Humana Press, Totowa, NJ1993: 269-276Google Scholar), which utilizes four primers (two mutagenic and two nonmutagenic) that are designed to generate double-stranded, linear DNA molecules with blunt ends. Once combined, denatured, and reannealed, this linear DNA produces double-stranded DNA with discrete cohesive single-stranded ends, in addition to the previously made blunt ends. However, only the former polymerase chain reaction product containing the mutation in each strand will anneal to form recombinant circles of DNA that can effectively mimic circular DNA that is necessary to be transformed into TG-1 cells. This method was successfully utilized for the production of the linear DNA, which then allowed the creation of a R81S mutagenic site (SnaBI) within the malate dehydrogenase gene, where the mismatched bases to create the mutagenic replacements are shown in lowercase and the newly introduced restriction endonuclease site is underlined: R81S, CG TAC Gta GT; and R81C, CG TAC Gtt GT. The process was then repeated using the R81S DNA as the template, with any subsequent mutations at position 81 destroying the newly createdSnaBI site. Initial screening for the presence of mutagenic colonies was accomplished by restriction enzyme mapping and was further verified by DNA sequencing. Chemical modification of R81C MDH with the various amino acid analog reagents was carried out in 250 mm borate buffer, pH 8.75, using an enzyme concentration of 4 mg/ml and a reagent concentration of 40 mm. The reagents were either obtained as the halides or were converted to the halides as described previously (17Schindler J.F. Viola R.E. J. Prot. Chem. 1996; 15: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The enzyme was typically incubated with each of the reagents for about 8 h at 4 °C. The extent of modification was followed by examining the free cysteine content, determined by the method of Ellman (18Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (20884) Google Scholar) or by several alternative fluorescent or enzyme-linked methods (19Wright S.K. Viola R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 265: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In each case one (±0.2) cysteine was modified in the R81C mutant, with no cysteine modification observed in the native enzyme. After completion of the modification, the reaction was terminated by the removal of excess reagent by Amicon Centricon-30 filtration, with three successive washes with the standard assay buffer. Molecular modeling studies were carried out on a Silicon Graphics O2 computer using the Sybyl (version 6.5) software package (Tripos, Inc.). Coordinates of native MDH were obtained as a Protein Data Bank file and the program Flexidock was used to position the substrates into the enzyme active site before energy minimization. This algorithm fixes the position of the protein backbone atoms and bonds and allows flexibility in the side chain and substrate atoms and bonds. The force field calculations take into account van der Waals', electrostatic, torsional, and constraint energy terms. To screen colonies for mutated MDH, the production of the R81C mutant was carried out in two stages. Initially, a serine was introduced at position 81 in place of the native arginine. This was accomplished as described under “Experimental Procedures” by a two base change that also created anSnaBI restriction endonuclease site. After isolation of the R81S mutant a second round of mutagenesis was used to replace this serine with a cysteine, thus destroying the newly createdSnaBI site. Restriction mapping for the presence and then the absence of this site was used to identify mutagenic colonies. Subsequent DNA sequencing, covering at least 800 bases centered around this position, confirmed the mutations that were made. The R81C mutant was purified by using the standard purification procedure (11Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. McAllister-Henn L. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 551-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters were determined for this mutant and compared with those of the native enzyme (TableI). Replacement of Arg-81 with Cys results in a 3-fold decrease in k cat, whereas essentially no change is observed in the Michaelis constant for OAA, leading to a modest 3-fold decrease ink cat/K m. Hydroxypyruvate, in which the β-carboxyl group of OAA is replaced by a hydroxyl group, is a poor alternative substrate for the native enzyme, with ak cat/K m value that is more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than that of OAA. Surprisingly, phenylpyruvate, in which the β-carboxyl group has been replaced with a phenyl ring, is also a substrate for MDH with ak cat and ak cat/K m that are comparable with those of hydroxypyruvate. The R81C mutant has ak cat with phenylpyruvate that is further decreased by a factor of 2 but has a lower K m that leads to a k cat/K m that is improved by 4-fold compared with the native enzyme (Table I). The product of this reaction, phenyllactate, is also an alternative substrate in the reverse reaction; however, precise kinetic parameters are difficult to determine because of an initial time lag that is observed under all of the substrate concentrations and pH values that were examined.Table ISubstrate specificity of native and R81C MDHa No activity detected. a No activity detected. Removal of the bulky arginyl side chain should provide an expanded binding pocket that should allow the accommodation of larger substrates into the active site. 2-Ketoglutarate, the 5-carbon homolog of OAA, is a poor alternative substrate for the native enzyme with ak cat that is only 2% and ak cat/K m that is 4-orders of magnitude lower than OAA (Table I). However, instead of seeing an improvement with this substrate, the R81C mutant shows no detectable activity with 2-ketoglutarate nor with several other potential alternative substrates including 2-ketocaproate, the 6-carbon homolog. In an attempt to provide an improved binding site and enhanced kinetics for phenylpyruvate as an alternative substrate the arginine at position 81 was replaced with a phenylalanine. The k catfor phenylpyruvate decreases with the R81F mutant, but by less than a factor of 2, whereas the K m value for this substrate shows a 3-fold improvement, resulting in a 2-fold enhancement ink cat/K m for phenylpyruvate compared with the native enzyme. The introduction of an aromatic side chain at this position also results in a decrease ink cat for the physiological substrate OAA to about 7% that of the native enzyme. However the K mvalue for OAA is not affected by this mutation (Table II).Table IISpecificity of modulated malate dehydrogenases for oxaloacetate and phenylpyruvateEnzyme formsOxaloacetatePhenylpyruvateOAA/phenylpyruvate ratiok cat 2-aStandard errors onk cat andk cat/K m are ±10% or less.

Open table in a new tab To create a significant alteration in the specificity of MDH, it appears necessary to introduce a wider range of new functional groups into the active site to modify the substrate specificity. To this end the R81C mutant was chemically modulated by using several different hydrophobic aliphatic and aromatic amino acid analog reagents. In each case, through the time course of the modification reaction, there is an observed decrease of approximately one free cysteine/enzyme subunit. This decrease is consistent with the selective modification of the introduced thiolate at position 81. The native enzyme, which contains three cysteines/subunit, is not modified to any significant extent by these reagents under the reaction conditions. This lack of reactivity was anticipated because these cysteines are nearly completely buried in the native MDH structure (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters for these modified enzymes were determined and were compared with both the native enzyme and to the unmodified mutant enzyme. Modulation of R81C with either 2-bromopropane or 1-bromo-2-methylpropane leads to the selective incorporation of a propyl or a 2-methylpropyl group at position 81. The resulting modified enzymes have essentially the same k cat with phenylpyruvate as the unmodified R81C mutant. However, theK m values for phenylpyruvate with these modified enzymes increase by factors of 2 and 3, respectively (Table II). Treatment of R81C MDH with benzyl bromide introduces a benzyl group at position 81, and this modified enzyme has a k catwith phenylpyruvate of 450 s−1 compared with 120 s−1 for the R81C mutant and 200 s−1 for the native enzyme. The benzyl-modified enzyme has a modest increase inK m when compared with the R81C mutant but has a 5-fold decrease when compared with the native enzyme, resulting in an overall improvement ink cat/K m for phenylpyruvate by a factor of 10 (Table II). Introduction of either an alkyl or an aryl group at position 81 leads to a further decrease in bothk cat andk cat/K m for OAA when compared with the unmodified R81C mutant, to values that are more than 2 orders of magnitude lower than those with the native enzyme. To examine the importance of the aromatic benzyl group in substrate recognition, the R81C mutant was modified with the related cyclohexyl derivative. A modest 4-fold decrease is observed in theK m for phenylpyruvate with this modified enzyme; however, there is also a 2-fold decrease seen ink cat. The k cat for OAA with this cyclohexyl-modified enzyme is less than 2% that of the native enzyme, and the 3-fold increase in K m leads to a greater than 200-fold decrease ink cat/K m for OAA. To further assess the role of an introduced aromatic group in substrate binding the R81C MDH mutant was modified with several substituted benzyl reagents. Introduction of either 4-fluoro- or 4-amino substituent on the benzyl group leads to a decrease ink cat, with OAA as the substrate, to 10–20% of the native enzyme with no effect on K m. Modification with 4-nitrobenzyl results in a more dramatic decrease ink cat, to less than 1% that of the native enzyme. Each of these enzymes that have been modified withp-substituted benzyl groups have k catvalues for phenylpyruvate that are only 20–50% that of the unmodified R81C enzyme, with K m values that are increased by up to a factor of 7 (Table II). These modified enzymes are each fairly specific for phenylpyruvate; pyruvate is not a substrate. Neither medium chain alkyl keto acids (e.g. 2-ketocaproate) nor a homologous aryl keto acid (phenylglyoxalate) are substrates for these R81C-modified enzymes when examined at concentrations up to 100 mm. Replacement of the β-carboxyl group of OAA with a hydroxyl group (hydroxypyruvate) leads to a modest decrease in k cat but a dramatic increase inK m by nearly 3 orders of magnitude. Substitution of a phenyl group at this substrate position has no additional deleterious effects, with native MDH preferring OAA as a substrate over phenylpyruvate by a factor of 2200. Removal of the arginine (Arg-81) that is proposed to interact with the β-carboxyl group of OAA results in a decline in this substrate preference to 200-fold with a thiol at this position and to only 100-fold when an aromatic site chain (phenylalanine) is introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The presence of a positively charged guanido group discriminates against the binding of an aromatic substrate like phenylpyruvate or even a polar functional group such as hydroxyl and its removal appears to relieve some of this discrimination. Replacement of this functional group with an appropriately selected alkyl or aryl residue has the potential to dramatically enhance the recognition of this alternative aromatic substrate. Incorporation of either a straight chain or a branched chain alkyl group at this position by chemical modulation of the introduced thiolate leads to a further decrease in the selectivity for the physiological substrates and against the aromatic alternative. Modification of R81C with benzyl bromide results in an enzyme form that still favors OAA as a substrate but now only by a factor of 17, and the cyclohexyl-modified enzyme has only a 6-fold preference for OAA over phenylpyruvate as measured byk cat/K m criteria. This is a 370-fold decrease in the original substrate discrimination against phenylpyruvate by MDH. However, although thek cat/K m values for phenylpyruvate have improved relative to those for OAA, thek cat values for this substrate have actually been reversed with the modified enzymes. When these substrates are compared by k cat criteria, phenylpyruvate is now the better substrate by nearly 8-fold in both the cyclohexyl- and the benzyl-modified enzymes. By comparison, the replacement of an entire loop in the binding site in LDH was required to generate an altered enzyme in which phenylpyruvate is the preferred substrate. The best enzyme form that has been produced from LDH through the insertion of four additional amino acids and substitutions at several other positions in this mobile loop has ak cat/K m for phenylpyruvate that is 1700 times better than that for pyruvate (8Wilks H.M. Moreton K.M. Halsall D.J. Hart K.W. Sessions R.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7802-7806Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, in this case, the reversal in specificity was achieved exclusively as a consequence of a dramatic decrease ink cat/K m for pyruvate, with no enhancement of the kinetics for phenylpyruvate. Despite the improvement in aromatic substrate selectivity, thek cat/K m for phenylpyruvate actually decreased by a factor of 2 in this altered LDH compared with the native enzyme. With MDH, the introduction of an aromatic benzyl group into the active site results in a 10-fold decrease ink cat/K m for OAA and a corresponding 10-fold increase for phenylpyruvate. The improvement in k cat/K mthat has been achieved for phenylpyruvate as a substrate upon modulation at a single position in MDH is unexpected in light of the more stringent substrate specificity of MDH compared with LDH. Unlike MDH, LDH can already utilize a range of straight and branched chain keto acids as reasonable alternative substrates, and this specificity can be further broadened by the mutagenic replacement of a single active site glutamine (20Nicholls D.J. Davey M. Jones S.E. Miller J. Holbrook J.J. Clarke A.R. Scawen M.D. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. J. Prot. Chem. 1994; 13: 129-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Substitution of an arginine at this position leads to a shift of 7 orders of magnitude in the specificity of LDH from its physiological substrate pyruvate to OAA with both a dramatic decrease in the specificity for pyruvate and a corresponding increase in that for OAA (21Clarke A.R. Atkinson T. Holbrook J.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 145-148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, attempts to carry out the complimentary study, the conversion of MDH to an LDH, have been less successful. Replacement of the corresponding arginine in MDH with a glutamine results in a decrease of 5 orders of magnitude ink cat/K m for OAA, with some improvement but no reversal in the specificity for pyruvate (10Nicholls D.J. Miller J. Scawen M.D. Clarke A.R. Holbrook J.J. Atkinson T. Goward C.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1057-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). If the improvement in specificity for phenylpyruvate with MDH is a consequence of binding interactions between the introduced aromatic ring at position 81 and the substrate aromatic ring, then substrate binding should be sensitive to modulations at this introduced ring. To examine this potential interaction several substituents were introduced at the para-position of the benzyl ring. These included the electron withdrawing 4-fluoro and 4-nitro groups and the electron donating 4-amino group. The expectation was that if there is an interaction between these aromatic rings, then altering the electron density of the benzyl ring should affect this interaction. Some kinetic changes are observed with the introduction of these substituents. Modification of MDH with a 4-aminobenzyl group leads to a 10-fold decrease ink cat/K m both for OAA and for phenylpyruvate and, therefore, virtually no change in substrate selectivity. In contrast, substitution of a 4-fluorobenzyl group results in an 8-fold shift in preference toward phenylpyruvate, and placing a 4-nitrobenzyl group in this position leads to a greater than 100-fold shift in preference. These specificity shifts do not strictly correlate with changes in electron density of the introduced benzyl ring and must reflect additional steric and orientation effects that will require high resolution structural mapping to understand. It is not immediately obvious from the structure of the native enzyme (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) how MDH can accommodate phenylpyruvate as an alternative substrate. In this structure the enzyme active site contains two arginyl residues (Arg-81 and Arg-153) that interact with two of the carboxyl groups of a bound citrate molecule (Fig. 1). It is proposed that these residues are the binding groups that the enzyme uses to orient OAA by electrostatic interactions with the α- and β-carboxyl groups of the substrate (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Removal of the positively charged guanido group of Arg-81 by site-directed mutagenesis results in a 3–6-fold improvement in the K m for phenylpyruvate. However, an examination of the active site structure of MDH does not reveal any hydrophobic pockets that the enzyme could use to accommodate the phenyl ring of this alternative substrate. To examine any potential interactions the substrates phenylpyruvate and NAD have been modeled into the MDH structure and energy minimized. This modeled structure shows a potential π-stacking interaction between the aromatic ring of phenylpyruvate and the nicotinamide ring of NAD that could account for some of the binding affinity for this alternative substrate (Fig.2 A). Interestingly, if the same ternary complex is modeled into the benzyl-modified R81C mutant, the introduced benzyl ring joins this π-stack to sandwich the substrate phenyl ring with the nicotinamide ring (Fig. 2 B). This structure would be expected to further stabilize the binding of phenylpyruvate and could explain the 130-fold improvement in substrate specificity relative to OAA. Replacement of this aromatic functional group at position 81 with a cyclic alkyl group leads to a 6-fold decrease in the specificity of this modified enzyme for phenylpyruvate, presumably because of the loss of aromatic stabilization in this enzyme form. A preliminary structure of the R81F mutant of MDH has just been determined in the absence of substrates. 2M. Rynkiewicz and R. E. Viola, unpublished results. This structure is essentially identical to that of the native enzyme (5Hall M.D. Levitt D.G. Banaszak L.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 867-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), except for a disordered loop that includes the site of mutation. This new structure confirms the local nature of any structural perturbations that might have occurred among this group of modified MDHs. We thank Dr. Norbert Furumo (Eastern Illinois University) for providing a plasmid containing the mdh gene and Dr. Greg Farber (Penn State University) for helpful discussions on the MDH structure."
