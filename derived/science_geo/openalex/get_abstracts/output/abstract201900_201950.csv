https://openalex.org/W2060791438,"THE time taken by human beings to react to one of a number of possible signals increases with the number of alternatives involved. The effects of jointly varying stimulus and response uncertainty have been long known and adequately discussed1,2. In the present investigation these were varied independently, by using situations where the same response was required for a number of stimuli. The number of responses, and the ratio of response/stimuli were varied."

https://openalex.org/W1982032763,"DURING a study of the fungal succession occurring on hair decomposing in contact with soil, it has become apparent that hair, either autoclaved or sterilized with propylene oxide, can support the limited growth of many fungi which are not keratinolytic. Thus species of Mortierella, Cunninghamella and Chaetomium, as well as of many genera of the Fungi Imperfecti, for example, Aspergillus, Gliocladium, Penicillium, Alternaria, Curvularia, Epicoccum, Helminihosporium, Phoma, Pyrenochaeta, grow sparsely on the hair surface and produce spores there."

https://openalex.org/W1988720889,THE following work was undertaken to determine the rate of transfer of magnesium across the sheep erythrocyte membrane held in a stable in vitro system. It is considered that such information should be of value in the elucidation of the etiology of hypomagnesæmia.

https://openalex.org/W2092688935,"ATTEMPTS are being made1 to detect the heterozygous state for galactosæmia by means of the uridine diphosphoglucose consumption test on erythrocytes —a test devised by us for the detection of galactosæmia2. This test was designed so as to give a maximum of difference between normal persons and persons having congenital galactosæmia, in which no galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase is discernible in erythrocytes3,4. In order to magnify this difference and hence provide an unambiguous proof for the clinician2,3 this reaction mixture is over-incubated. With near-normal activities, the reaction is brought close to the equilibrium point (cf. refs. 2, 4, 5), and the rates measured are obviously not maximum rates. Experiments in which aliquots for uridine diphosphoglucose determination were taken at 5, 10 and 20 min. incubation time designed to give a quantitative expression of maximum rates have also been carried out5. In this work we used the consumption as well as the combined epimerase test2,3, and yet, only in about two-thirds of the specimens did we succeed in obtaining linearity between incubation time and conversion. Accordingly, we believe it even less likely that the unmodified clinical consumption test (in which only one aliquot at 30 min. incubation is drawn) should be able to detect heterozygous carriers. Therefore, as stated previously2,6, we do not recommend the consumption test for the latter purpose."

The extreme porosity resulted in substantial over-absorption of water-repellent preservative solutions which are normally applied to millwork, with consequent difficulties in painting and utilization."

The distinctive scalloped form of basis produced on toxic anti-fouling paints has been illustrated by these and other authors. The same deformity occurs when settlement takes place on a toxic metal surface, for example, the copper sheathing of a wooden hull."
