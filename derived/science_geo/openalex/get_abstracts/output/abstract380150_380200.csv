https://openalex.org/W1979594866,"We developed the Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool (GREAT) to analyze the functional significance of cis-regulatory regions identified by localized measurements of DNA binding events across an entire genome. Whereas previous methods took into account only binding proximal to genes, GREAT is able to properly incorporate distal binding sites and control for false positives using a binomial test over the input genomic regions. GREAT incorporates annotations from 20 ontologies and is available as a web application. Applying GREAT to data sets from chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq) of multiple transcription-associated factors, including SRF, NRSF, GABP, Stat3 and p300 in different developmental contexts, we recover many functions of these factors that are missed by existing gene-based tools, and we generate testable hypotheses. The utility of GREAT is not limited to ChIP-seq, as it could also be applied to open chromatin, localized epigenomic markers and similar functional data sets, as well as comparative genomics sets."
https://openalex.org/W2055362996,"Despite its increasing use in experimental and clinical settings, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) remain unknown. Anodal tDCS applied to the human motor cortex (M1) improves motor skill learning. Here, we demonstrate in mouse M1 slices that DCS induces a long-lasting synaptic potentiation (DCS-LTP), which is polarity specific, NMDA receptor dependent, and requires coupling of DCS with repetitive low-frequency synaptic activation (LFS). Combined DCS and LFS enhance BDNF-secretion and TrkB activation, and DCS-LTP is absent in BDNF and TrkB mutant mice, suggesting that BDNF is a key mediator of this phenomenon. Moreover, the BDNF val66met polymorphism known to partially affect activity-dependent BDNF secretion impairs motor skill acquisition in humans and mice. Motor learning is enhanced by anodal tDCS, as long as activity-dependent BDNF secretion is in place. We propose that tDCS may improve motor skill learning through augmentation of synaptic plasticity that requires BDNF secretion and TrkB activation within M1."
https://openalex.org/W2135229538,"Recruitment of the RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcription initiation apparatus to promoters by specific DNA-binding transcription factors is well recognized as a key regulatory step in gene expression. We report here that promoter-proximal pausing is a general feature of transcription by Pol II in mammalian cells and thus an additional step where regulation of gene expression occurs. This suggests that some transcription factors recruit the transcription apparatus to promoters, whereas others effect promoter-proximal pause release. Indeed, we find that the transcription factor c-Myc, a key regulator of cellular proliferation, plays a major role in Pol II pause release rather than Pol II recruitment at its target genes. We discuss the implications of these results for the role of c-Myc amplification in human cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2145619687,"Layered on top of information conveyed by DNA sequence and chromatin are higher order structures that encompass portions of chromosomes, entire chromosomes, and even whole genomes. Interphase chromosomes are not positioned randomly within the nucleus, but instead adopt preferred conformations. Disparate DNA elements co-localize into functionally defined aggregates or 'factories' for transcription and DNA replication. In budding yeast, Drosophila and many other eukaryotes, chromosomes adopt a Rabl configuration, with arms extending from centromeres adjacent to the spindle pole body to telomeres that abut the nuclear envelope. Nonetheless, the topologies and spatial relationships of chromosomes remain poorly understood. Here we developed a method to globally capture intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and applied it to generate a map at kilobase resolution of the haploid genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The map recapitulates known features of genome organization, thereby validating the method, and identifies new features. Extensive regional and higher order folding of individual chromosomes is observed. Chromosome XII exhibits a striking conformation that implicates the nucleolus as a formidable barrier to interaction between DNA sequences at either end. Inter-chromosomal contacts are anchored by centromeres and include interactions among transfer RNA genes, among origins of early DNA replication and among sites where chromosomal breakpoints occur. Finally, we constructed a three-dimensional model of the yeast genome. Our findings provide a glimpse of the interface between the form and function of a eukaryotic genome."

One chromatin-modifying activity associated with Polycomb is an enzyme that ubiquitinates histone H2A. Here, Scheuermann et al. find a Drosophila PcG complex with H2A deubiquitination activity that is important for gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus involve a dynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination and deubiquitination. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that modify chromatin and regulate important developmental genes. One PcG-associated, chromatin-modifying activity is an enzyme that ubiquitinates histone H2A of chromatin. Here, a fruitfly PcG complex that is associated with H2A deubiquitination, and thereby with gene repression, is identified. PcG-mediated gene silencing might thus involve a dynamic balance between ubiquitination and deubiquitination of H2A. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins are transcriptional repressors that control processes ranging from the maintenance of cell fate decisions and stem cell pluripotency in animals to the control of flowering time in plants1,2,3,4,5,6. In Drosophila, genetic studies identified more than 15 different PcG proteins that are required to repress homeotic (HOX) and other developmental regulator genes in cells where they must stay inactive1,7,8. Biochemical analyses established that these PcG proteins exist in distinct multiprotein complexes that bind to and modify chromatin of target genes1,2,3,4. Among those, Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) and the related dRing-associated factors (dRAF) complex contain an E3 ligase activity for monoubiquitination of histone H2A (refs 1–4). Here we show that the uncharacterized Drosophila PcG gene calypso encodes the ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase BAP1. Biochemically purified Calypso exists in a complex with the PcG protein ASX, and this complex, named Polycomb repressive deubiquitinase (PR-DUB), is bound at PcG target genes in Drosophila. Reconstituted recombinant Drosophila and human PR-DUB complexes remove monoubiquitin from H2A but not from H2B in nucleosomes. Drosophila mutants lacking PR-DUB show a strong increase in the levels of monoubiquitinated H2A. A mutation that disrupts the catalytic activity of Calypso, or absence of the ASX subunit abolishes H2A deubiquitination in vitro and HOX gene repression in vivo. Polycomb gene silencing may thus entail a dynamic balance between H2A ubiquitination by PRC1 and dRAF, and H2A deubiquitination by PR-DUB."
https://openalex.org/W2168210128,"Sequential transport from early to late endosomes requires the coordinated activities of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. The transition between early and late endosomes could be mediated either through transport carriers or by Rab conversion, a process in which the loss of Rab5 from an endosome occurs concomitantly to the acquisition of Rab7. We demonstrate that Rab conversion is the mechanism by which proteins pass from early to late endosomes in Caenorhabditis elegans coelomocytes. Moreover, we identified SAND-1/Mon1 as the critical switch for Rab conversion in metazoa. SAND-1 serves a dual role in this process. First, it interrupts the positive feedback loop of RAB-5 activation by displacing RABX-5 from endosomal membranes; second, it times the recruitment of RAB-7, probably through interaction with the HOPS complex to the same membranes. SAND-1/Mon1 thus acts as a switch by controlling the localization of RAB-5 and RAB-7 GEFs. Sequential transport from early to late endosomes requires the coordinated activities of the small GTPases Rab5 and Rab7. The transition between early and late endosomes could be mediated either through transport carriers or by Rab conversion, a process in which the loss of Rab5 from an endosome occurs concomitantly to the acquisition of Rab7.

SAND-1/Mon1 thus acts as a switch by controlling the localization of RAB-5 and RAB-7 GEFs. Rab conversion is a conserved process in early-to-late endosome maturation SAND-1/Mon1 displaces the Rab5 GEF, Rabex5, from early endosomes The recruitment of Rab7 onto endosomes is facilitated by SAND-1/Mon1 SAND-1/Mon1 acts as switch by controlling Rab5 and Rab7 localization on endosomes Material to be taken up by a cell is included into invaginations at the plasma membrane. These invaginations of either tubular or vesicular structure are released from the plasma membrane to the inside of the cell by a fission event. The products of such endocytic events fuse with early endosomes, which are marked by the presence of a small GTPase of the Rab family, Rab5, and by Rab5 effector proteins such as EEA1 and phosphoinositide kinase Vps34. The early endosome is also referred to as the sorting endosome (Spang, 2009Spang A. On the fate of early endosomes.Biol. Chem. 2009; 390: 753-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), because proteins can be recycled to the plasma membrane, brought to the trans-Golgi network, or targeted for destruction by the lysosome. Lysosomal sorting involves the transfer of proteins to late endosomes, which are equivalent to multivesicular bodies. The late endosomes are marked by another small GTPase of the Rab family, Rab7. Early endosomes not only fuse with incoming endocytic transport carriers but also undergo homotypic fusion as well as fission events, as a mechanism whereby recycling cargo is sorted from cargo destined for degradation. In fact, these homotypic fusion events can be considered as a hallmark of early endosomes. The nature of endosomal transport is not resolved. One possibility is that early and late endosomes are rather static entities, between which material is transferred by transport carriers (vesicle transport model). Support for this model has been provided by Vonderheit and Helenius, 2005Vonderheit A. Helenius A. Rab7 associates with early endosomes to mediate sorting and transport of Semliki forest virus to late endosomes.PLoS Biol. 2005; 3: e233Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, who observed budding of Rab7 domains from Rab5-positive endosomes. Alternatively, the early endosome could be remodeled to become a late endosome, as in a Rab conversion model. There is a consensus that Rab7 domains are present on early endosomes. Consistent with this possibility, studies have shown that the Rab7 domain grows on the early endosome and converts the Rab5-positive endosome into a Rab7-positive compartment (Rink et al., 2005Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The transition mechanism from early-to-late endosomes is complicated by a positive feedback loop involving Rab5. The recruitment of Rab5 to endosomes by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Rabex5 initiates the subsequent binding and activation of effector molecules such as the phosphoinositide kinase Vps34, which produces PI(3)P. This, in turn, increases the binding of Rab5 and more effector molecules (Christoforidis et al., 1999Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. The Rab5 effector EEA1 is a core component of endosome docking.Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). While in the vesicle transport model the reinforcement of early endosomal identity poses no problem, the Rab conversion model would predict the requirement for a factor that would disrupt the positive feedback loop to promote the Rab5-to-Rab7 switch (Del Conte-Zerial et al., 2008Del Conte-Zerial P. Brusch L. Rink J.C. Collinet C. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Deutsch A. Membrane identity and GTPase cascades regulated by toggle and cut-out switches.Mol. Syst. Biol. 2008; 4: 206Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the endocytic machinery is highly conserved from yeast to mammals. Therefore, different experimental systems (e.g., yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, and tissue culture) can be used to address questions about the endocytic core machinery. Macrophage-like C. elegans coelomocytes offer the advantage of containing highly active large endosomes, which are easily spotted already at the light-microscope level. The availability of endosomal and lysosomal markers, in combination with the tracing of endocytosed BSA-TR, makes these cells an excellent system to study endocytosis events by life cell imaging in a whole living organism. In this study, we identified the first important regulator, SAND-1/Mon1, in the Rab conversion process. We demonstrate that SAND-1/Mon1 acts as a disruptor of the positive feedback loop by displacing RABX-5 from early endosomal membranes. Moreover, SAND-1/Mon1 actively drives the recruitment of Rab7 onto endosomes, most likely through interaction with the Rab7 guanine exchange factor complex HOPS. Therefore, we propose that SAND-1/Mon1 is the switch in early-to-late endosome maturation (Rab conversion) that regulates the activity state of Rab5 and Rab7. Previously, we have shown that SAND-1 plays a crucial role in the recruitment of RAB-7 to endosomal membranes in oocytes and in coelomocytes in C. elegans (Poteryaev et al., 2007Poteryaev D. Fares H. Bowerman B. Spang A. Caenorhabditis elegans SAND-1 is essential for RAB-7 function in endosomal traffic.Embo. J. 2007; 26: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, we observed that loss of SAND-1 function results in a large accumulation of RAB-5 protein, as measured by immunoblotting lysate from sand-1(or552) worms (Poteryaev et al., 2007Poteryaev D. Fares H. Bowerman B. Spang A. Caenorhabditis elegans SAND-1 is essential for RAB-7 function in endosomal traffic.Embo. J. 2007; 26: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We now find that most of this additional RAB-5 is associated with early endosomes that are still able to undergo homotypic membrane fusion (see Figure S1A and Movie S1 available online). The block of the transition from early to late endosomes and the continued activation of RAB-5 is a likely explanation for the enlarged endosomes found in sand-1(or552) animals. This phenotype is reminiscent of the phenotype observed after overexpression of the dominant-active form of Rab5 in mammalian cells (Rink et al., 2005Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M.

Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Together, these observations suggest that, in the absence of SAND-1, RAB-5 retained on the endosomal membrane is at least partially in the active state and that the positive feedback loop initiated by RAB-5 is still active. Therefore, SAND-1 could play two roles in early-to-late endosome transport: first, SAND-1 might be required for the repression of RAB-5 on early endosomes, and second, it might play a direct role in the recruitment and/or activation of RAB-7 on these endosomes. So far, Rab conversion has been demonstrated in only one mammalian cell line (Rink et al., 2005Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). To establish that Rab conversion is a more general and widely used mechanism and that SAND-1 is potentially involved in this process, we expressed GFP::RAB-5 and mCherry::RAB-7 in coelomocytes and monitored the disappearance of GFP::RAB-5 and the acquisition of mCherry::RAB-7 on the same endosomes over time (Figure 1). Coelomocytes are especially well suited for this kind of experiment, because their endosomes are unusually large, and they appear in the light microscope as spheres with a lumen and a limiting membrane. The expression of the exogenous proteins in coelomocytes did not alter the size or distribution of endosomes, compared with coelomocytes that did not express any marker and in which the endocytic pathway was highlighted by uptake of the fluid-phase marker BSA-Texas Red (BSA-TR) or secreted soluble GFP (Poteryaev et al., 2007Poteryaev D. Fares H. Bowerman B. Spang A. Caenorhabditis elegans SAND-1 is essential for RAB-7 function in endosomal traffic.Embo. J. 2007; 26: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). When we imaged coelomocytes expressing both GFP::RAB-5 and mCherry::RAB-7 using 4D-microscopy, we observed that early endosomes lost the GFP::RAB-5 signal over time and synchronously acquired mCherry::RAB-7 (Figure 1A, arrows point to an endosome undergoing conversion, Movie S2). We cannot exclude that small vesicles could also form but these are not detectable by this method and do not appear to have a major contribution in early-to-late endosomes transition. Quantification of the fluorescent signal revealed that the kinetics of RAB-5 depletion and RAB-7 recruitment to the same endosomal membrane were similar to one another (Figure 1B). These data demonstrate that Rab conversion is a general mechanism for early-to-late endosome transport and support the idea that this mechanism is conserved throughout metazoa. If SAND-1 were required for terminating the positive feedback loop of RAB-5 activation, one might expect that SAND-1 should block RAB-5 activation in some way. Because the SAND-1 did not bind RAB-5 by yeast two-hybrid assay, and the mammalian homolog Mon1 did not interact with the inactive or active form of Rab5 in vitro (Figure S2A), we tested the interaction of SAND-1 with RAB-5 GEFs, which are all VPS9 domain–containing proteins. Three VPS9 domain–containing proteins have been annotated in the C. elegans genome: RABX-5, RME-6, and TAG-333. RME-6 is supposed to function at the onset of endocytosis at the plasma membrane and has partially overlapping function with RABX-5 (Sato et al., 2005Sato M. Sato K. Fonarev P. Huang C.J. Liou W. Grant B.D. Caenorhabditis elegans RME-6 is a novel regulator of RAB-5 at the clathrin-coated pit.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 559-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The function of TAG-333 remains elusive, but it cannot substitute for either RABX-5 or RME-6. We found that SAND-1 interacted specifically with RABX-5 in a yeast two-hybrid assay (Figure 2A and Figure S2C), and that His6-RABX-5 bound to GST-SAND-1 (Figure S2B). Moreover, recombinant Mon1a and Mon1b interacted with GST-Rabex5 in vitro (Figure S2E and Figure 2B). We mapped the interaction site of SAND-1 to the helical bundle of RABX-5 (Figure 2A and Figure S2D). Interestingly, the helical bundle serves a dual purpose: it stabilizes the VPS9 domain and contributes to the GEF activity (Delprato et al., 2004Delprato A. Merithew E. Lambright D.G. Structure, exchange determinants, and family-wide rab specificity of the tandem helical bundle and Vps9 domains of Rabex-5.Cell. 2004; 118: 607-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In addition, the helical bundle together with the upstream helix constitutes the early-endosome-targeting domain (Zhu et al., 2007Zhu H. Zhu G. Liu J. Liang Z. Zhang X.C. Li G. Rabaptin-5-independent membrane targeting and Rab5 activation by Rabex-5 in the cell.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 4119-4128Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We first tested whether the mammalian ortholog of SAND-1, Mon1b, could influence the guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Rabex-5 in vitro. However, we could not detect any major changes in the exchange rates on Rab5 using a fluorescent read-out assay (Figure S2F). Moreover, Rabex-5 did not exchange guanine nucleotide on Rab7 independently of the presence of Mon1b (Figure S2F). Finally, RABX-5 seems to act upstream of SAND-1, because rabex-5(RNAi) rescued the large endosome phenotype of the sand-1(or552) mutant (Figure S1B) similarly to the knockdown of RAB-5, clathrin heavy chain (Poteryaev et al., 2007Poteryaev D. Fares H. Bowerman B. Spang A. Caenorhabditis elegans SAND-1 is essential for RAB-7 function in endosomal traffic.Embo. J. 2007; 26: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) or the plasma membrane RAB-5 GEF RME-6 (Figure S1B). Therefore, it seems unlikely that the main function of SAND-1 is to interfere with the catalytical activity of RABX-5.Figure 2SAND-1 Interacts with the RAB-5 GEF, RABX-5Show full caption(A) Schematic drawing depicting the SAND-1 interaction with the helical bundle domain of RABX-5 in yeast two-hybrid assay.(B) The mammalian SAND-1 homolog Mon1b interacts with Rabex5 in vitro.

Because SAND-1 had no significant impact on RABX-5 GEF activity, we next tested whether SAND-1 interferes with RABX-5 localization. First, we demonstrated that GFP::RABX-5 is localized to early endosomes in coelomocytes by following the endocytic marker BSA-TR (Figure 2C and Figures S2G and S2H). RABX-5 was not continuously present on a particular endosome but was released within a time frame of 1–2 min (Figure 2C and Figures S2G and S2H). However, the enlarged endosomes in sand-1(or552) remained RABX-5 positive even after a 60 min chase period of BSA-TR, whereas in wild-type coelomocytes, all BSA-TR is found in lysosomes after a 60 min chase (Poteryaev et al., 2007Poteryaev D. Fares H. Bowerman B. Spang A. Caenorhabditis elegans SAND-1 is essential for RAB-7 function in endosomal traffic.Embo. J. 2007; 26: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity ratio of GFP::RABX-5 between the cytoplasm and endosomes was strongly increased in sand-1(or552) compared to wild-type coelomocytes (Figure 2E). These data demonstrate that, in the absence of SAND-1 function, RABX-5 is trapped on the early endosome. Furthermore, these results suggest that under these conditions more RAB-5 is activated and the positive feedback loop is not interrupted. Therefore, the conversion to the late endosome cannot occur. Next we asked whether the role of SAND-1 in Rab conversion is conserved throughout metazoa. SAND-1 has two homologs in vertebrates, Mon1a and Mon1b, neither of which has been implicated in early-to-late endosome transport. HeLa cells expressing GFP-tagged Rab5c under the endogenous promoter were transfected with siRNAs specifically silencing either the Mon1a or Mon1b or both and quantified the effects on the size of the fluorescently labeled early endosomes using MotionTracking software (Rink et al., 2005Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Rab conversion as a mechanism of progression from early to late endosomes.Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1200) Google Scholar). The efficiency of the knockdowns was quantified by qRT-PCR and immunoblot (Figures 3A and 3B ). Although individual knockdown of Mon1a or Mon1b affected only mildly early endosome morphology (data not shown), the double knockdown caused GFP-Rab5c-positive endosomes to be strongly enlarged (Figure 3C). These enlarged Rabex-5-positive endosomes were still competent in the uptake of DiI-LDL (Figure 3D), similar to the phenotype observed in C. elegans. These results suggest that the concomitant depletion of both Mon1a and Mon1b causes the accumulation of Rab5 on expanded endosomes similar to the expression of the activated Rab5 mutant, arguing that Rab conversion is impaired and, thus, that the function of SAND-1 is conserved throughout metazoa. RABX-5 is trapped on early endosomes in the absence of functional SAND-1 (Figure 2). If this entrapment were a direct consequence of loss of SAND-1 function, overexpression of SAND-1 would be sufficient to remove RABX-5 from endosomes. To test this possibility, we overexpressed Mon1a/b in HeLa cells expressing GFP-Rabex5 (Figure 4). This overexpression caused the redistribution of Rabex5 from endosomes to smaller vesicles, which are likely of endocytic origin (Figures 4B–4E and 4G). Interestingly, a subpopulation of Mon1a/b colocalized with Rabex5 on some endosomal structures. Moreover, the soluble pool of Rabex5 was significantly increased (Figure 4F). Thus, Mon1a/b overexpression affects GFP-Rabex5 localization in HeLa cells. To gain more mechanistic insights about the effects of SAND-1/Mon1 on Rabex5, we incubated enriched endosomal fractions with recombinant Mon1b and subjected the mixture to buoyant density centrifugation, which caused the membranes to float and soluble proteins to be retained in lower fractions. The addition of Mon1b caused the relocalization of at least a part of Rabex5 from the membrane-bound to the soluble pool of proteins (Figure 4H). As a consequence of the dissociation of Rabex5 from the endosomes, Rab5 association with endosomes should be impaired. Indeed, the cumulative size of Rab5-positive structures decreased upon Mon1a/b overexpression, indicating that the soluble Rab5 pool was increased (Figures S3E–S3J). This effect was specific because the dominant-active form of Rab5 would not redistribute (Figures S3K–S3P). In fact, overexpression of the dominant-active form of Rab5 caused a massive increase in the size of early endosomes (Figures S3A–S3D), as had been observed elsewhere (Seachrist et al., 2000Seachrist J.L.

The Z values are shown. To corroborate these results, we turned to Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system. The endocytic pathway is well conserved between yeast and metazoan, and overexpression of a protein is easier to achieve and to control in yeast than in C. elegans. Therefore, we expressed C. elegans GFP::RABX-5 under the inducible MET25 promoter (the lower the methionine concentration, the higher the gene expression) in wild-type yeast cells. GFP-RABX-5 was found on endosomes (Figure 5A ), as indicated by staining endosomes with FM4-64 (Figure 5A and Figure S4). Furthermore, strong overexpression of RABX-5 stimulated homotypic endosome fusion in yeast (Figure 5A, 1x Met, empty vector). This phenotype is very similar to the one observed after overexpression of the endogenous yeast Rab5, Ypt51a/Vps21 (Gerrard et al., 2000Gerrard S.R. Bryant N.J. Stevens T.H. VPS21 controls entry of endocytosed and biosynthetic proteins into the yeast prevacuolar compartment.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The homotypic endosome fusion was dependent on RABX-5 expression because down-regulating its expression (by the increasing methionine levels in the medium) reduced the size of the endosomes (Figure 5A, 2x Met). We conclude that C. elegans RABX-5 is functional in yeast and that it can activate Ypt51a/Vps21 in yeast.Figure S4Analysis of RABX-5 in Yeast and C.

https://openalex.org/W2064620642,"Pink for Me, Green for You Aphids come in different colors, a critical issue when fate is a question of pigmentation: Red aphids tend to be consumed by ladybugs and green ones by parasitic wasps. Aphid color is determined by carotenoids, the same group of chemicals that make flamingos pink. But unlike flamingos, which have to eat colored food to stay pink, aphids make their own pigment. Carotenoids are vital to animals, not only because of their decorative possibilities but also for their oxidation-protective qualities as visual pigments and immune-system modulators. On sifting through an aphid genome, Moran and Jarvik (p. 624 ; see the Perspective by Fukatsu ) discovered that the machinery for producing carotenoids has been acquired by an ancestral aphid in a lateral transfer event from a fungus. Although a spontaneous yellow mutant aphid was found that still possesses the sequence for biosynthesis of the red carotenoid pigment torulene, the sequence was discovered to have a single point mutation that puts a stop to turning red."
https://openalex.org/W2157071511,"We describe a new repressible binary expression system based on the regulatory genes from the Neurospora qa gene cluster. This “Q system” offers attractive features for transgene expression in Drosophila and mammalian cells: low basal expression in the absence of the transcriptional activator QF, high QF-induced expression, and QF repression by its repressor QS. Additionally, feeding flies quinic acid can relieve QS repression. The Q system offers many applications, including (1) intersectional “logic gates” with the GAL4 system for manipulating transgene expression patterns, (2) GAL4-independent MARCM analysis, and (3) coupled MARCM analysis to independently visualize and genetically manipulate siblings from any cell division. We demonstrate the utility of the Q system in determining cell division patterns of a neuronal lineage and gene function in cell growth and proliferation, and in dissecting neurons responsible for olfactory attraction. The Q system can be expanded to other uses in Drosophila and to any organism conducive to transgenesis."

https://openalex.org/W1985340978,"Learning to Work Together In group endeavors, there is often a tension between working for the greater good of the group as a whole versus working for one's own benefit. Sometimes these paths coincide and sometimes they do not; furthermore, the choices made by other group members can influence the calculation of which path to take. A pair of studies now approaches this challenge from experimental and theoretical points of view. In a forest or fishery, harvesting of wood or food needs to take into account the renewable character of the resource, as well as spatial heterogeneity. Janssen et al. (p. 613 ; see the Perspective by Putterman ) show that communication among the group members is key, both to establishing a maintainable rate of harvesting, as well as enforcement via punishment of noncompliers. Boyd et al. (p. 617 ; see the Perspective by Putterman ) develop a model showing that punishment, which is a costly activity, is most effectively levied when implemented with the approval of group members; that is, coordinated punishment works to the benefit of the whole, whereas individual actions do not."
https://openalex.org/W2138260451,"In many regions of the visual system, the activity of a neuron is normalized by the activity of other neurons in the same region. Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2067262890,"Stringent control of the NF-kappaB and type I interferon signaling pathways is critical to effective host immune responses, yet the molecular mechanisms that negatively regulate these pathways are poorly understood. Here, we show that NLRC5, a member of the highly conserved NOD-like protein family, can inhibit the IKK complex and RIG-I/MDA5 function. NLRC5 inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent responses by interacting with IKKalpha and IKKbeta and blocking their phosphorylation. It also interacted with RIG-I and MDA5, but not with MAVS, to inhibit RLR-mediated type I interferon responses. Consistent with these observations, NLRC5-specific siRNA knockdown not only enhanced the activation of NF-kappaB and its responsive genes, TNF-alpha and IL-6, but also promoted type I interferon signaling and antiviral immunity. Our findings identify NLRC5 as a negative regulator that blocks two central components of the NF-kappaB and type I interferon signaling pathways and suggest an important role for NLRC5 in homeostatic control of innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2149112028,"Although we often encounter circumstances with which we have no prior experience, we rapidly learn how to behave in these novel situations. Such adaptive behavior relies on abstract behavioral rules that are generalizable, rather than concrete rules mapping specific cues to specific responses. Although the frontal cortex is known to support concrete rule learning, less well understood are the neural mechanisms supporting the acquisition of abstract rules. Here, we use a reinforcement learning paradigm to demonstrate that more anterior regions along the rostro-caudal axis of frontal cortex support rule learning at higher levels of abstraction. Moreover, these results indicate that when humans confront new rule learning problems, this rostro-caudal division of labor supports the search for relationships between context and action at multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously."
https://openalex.org/W1975677298,"Bacteria coordinate expression of virulence determinants in response to localized microenvironments in their hosts. Here we show that Shigella flexneri, which causes dysentery, encounters varying oxygen concentrations in the gastrointestinal tract, which govern activity of its type three secretion system (T3SS). The T3SS is essential for cell invasion and virulence. In anaerobic environments (for example, the gastrointestinal tract lumen), Shigella is primed for invasion and expresses extended T3SS needles while reducing Ipa (invasion plasmid antigen) effector secretion. This is mediated by FNR (fumarate and nitrate reduction), a regulator of anaerobic metabolism that represses transcription of spa32 and spa33, virulence genes that regulate secretion through the T3SS. We demonstrate there is a zone of relative oxygenation adjacent to the gastrointestinal tract mucosa, caused by diffusion from the capillary network at the tips of villi. This would reverse the anaerobic block of Ipa secretion, allowing T3SS activation at its precise site of action, enhancing invasion and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2059746123,"Perceptual decisions arise from the activity of neurons distributed across brain circuits. But, decoding the mechanisms behind this cognitive operation across brain circuits has long posed a difficult problem. We recorded the neuronal activity of diverse cortical areas, while monkeys performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. We find that the encoding of the stimuli during the stimulus periods, working memory, and comparison periods is widely distributed across cortical areas. Notably, during the comparison and postponed decision report periods the activity of frontal brain circuits encode both the result of the sensory evaluation that corresponds to the monkey's possible choices and past information on which the decision is based. These results suggest that frontal lobe circuits are more engaged in the readout of sensory information from working memory, when it is required to be compared with other sensory inputs, than simply engaged in motor responses during this task."
https://openalex.org/W1990188178,"Bazooka (PAR-3), PAR-6, and aPKC form a complex that plays a key role in the polarization of many cell types. In epithelial cells, however, Bazooka localizes below PAR-6 and aPKC at the apical/lateral junction. Here, we show that Baz is excluded from the apical aPKC domain in epithelia by aPKC phosphorylation, which disrupts the Baz/aPKC interaction. Removal of Baz from the complex is epithelial-specific because it also requires the Crumbs complex, which prevents the Baz/PAR-6 interaction. In the absence of Crumbs or aPKC phosphorylation of Baz, mislocalized Baz recruits adherens junction components apically, leading to a loss of the apical domain and an expansion of lateral. Thus, apical exclusion of Baz by Crumbs and aPKC defines the apical/lateral border. Although Baz acts as an aPKC targeting and specificity factor in nonepithelial cells, our results reveal that it performs a complementary function in positioning the adherens junction in epithelia.

The polarity of all polarized cell types investigated so far depends on the PAR-3 or Bazooka (Baz) complex, which comprises the multiple PDZ domain protein, PAR-3 (Baz in Drosophila), the semi-CRIB and PDZ domain protein, PAR-6, and atypical Protein Kinase C (aPKC) (Goldstein and Macara, 2007Goldstein B. Macara I.G. The PAR proteins: fundamental players in animal cell polarization.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). The PAR-3 complex was first identified in the C. elegans zygote, where it localizes to the anterior cortex, with PAR-2 and PAR-1 forming a complementary posterior cortical domain (Etemad-Moghadam et al., 1995Etemad-Moghadam B.

Atypical protein kinase C cooperates with PAR-3 to establish embryonic polarity in Caenorhabditis elegans.Development. 1998; 125: 3607-3614Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PAR protein asymmetry directs the localization of cytoplasmic determinants and the orientation of the first mitotic spindle, resulting in an asymmetric cell division that generates the anterior-posterior (AP) axis of the worm (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P.

The PAR proteins play a similar role in the formation of the AP axis in Drosophila. At stage 9 of oogenesis, PAR-1 and Lgl localize to the posterior cortex of the oocyte, and Baz (PAR-3), PAR-6, and aPKC mark the anterior and lateral cortex (González-Reyes et al., 1995González-Reyes A.

Deng W.M. Lgl and its phosphorylation by aPKC regulate oocyte polarity formation in Drosophila.Development. 2008; 135: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This polarized distribution of PAR proteins induces the formation of an anterior-posterior gradient of microtubules that directs the localization of the axis determining transcripts to define the AP axis of the future embryo (Bastock and St Johnston, 2008Bastock R. St Johnston D. Drosophila oogenesis.Curr. Biol. 2008; 18: R1082-R1087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The Baz/Par-6/aPKC complex also plays an essential role in polarizing the asymmetric divisions of the Drosophila neuroblasts (Gönczy, 2008Gönczy P.

Spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division.Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). As the neuroblast enters mitosis, Baz recruits PAR-6/aPKC to the apical cortex, and aPKC then phosphorylates Numb and Miranda to exclude them from the apical region, thereby localizing the basal determinants (Atwood and Prehoda, 2009Atwood S.X.

Linking cell cycle to asymmetric division: Aurora-A phosphorylates the Par complex to regulate Numb localization.Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Baz binds directly to Numb to recruit it for aPKC phosphorylation, and therefore functions both as a localization factor and substrate specificity determinant for aPKC in the polarization of the neuroblast division. Epithelia form the majority of tissues in the body, and must be polarized along their apical-basal axis to perform their essential functions as barriers between different compartments. Unlike the C. elegans zygote and the Drosophila oocyte and neuroblast, epithelial cells have at least four distinct cortical domains: an apical domain, an apical-lateral junction (the tight junction in vertebrates and the Adherens junction [AJ] in Drosophila), a lateral domain, and a basal domain. The formation of the apical-lateral junction is key feature of epithelia, as it holds adjacent cells together to form epithelial sheets, provides the barrier to paracellular diffusion in mammals, and demarcates the boundary between apical and basolateral membrane domains (Anderson et al., 2004Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Fanning A.S. Setting up a selective barrier at the apical junction complex.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). As in other cell types, Baz/PAR-3, PAR-6, and aPKC are essential for the formation of polarized epithelia (Goldstein and Macara, 2007Goldstein B. Macara I.G. The PAR proteins: fundamental players in animal cell polarization.Dev. Cell. 2007; 13: 609-622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). In addition to the PAR proteins, epithelial polarity depends on the Crumbs (Crb) and “Scribble” polarity complexes. The Crb complex contains the transmembrane protein, Crb, the MAGUK protein, Stardust/PALS1 (Sdt), and Patj (Assémat et al., 2008Assémat E. Bazellières E. Pallesi-Pocachard E. Le Bivic A. Massey-Harroche D. Polarity complex proteins.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778: 614-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). This complex localizes to the apical domain in both Drosophila and mammalian epithelia and seems to act as the apical determinant (Lemmers et al., 2004Lemmers C. Michel D. Lane-Guermonprez L.

By contrast, the components of the Scribble complex, Scribble, Dlg, and Lgl, localize below the apical-lateral junction, where they antagonize the Crb complex (Bilder et al., 2003Bilder D. Schober M.

Although Baz/PAR-3, PAR-6, and aPKC are often assumed to function as a complex in epithelial cells, there is increasing evidence that Baz/PAR-3 acts independently from PAR-6 and aPKC in this cell type. First, PAR-6 and aPKC localize to the apical and subapical region in many different epithelia, whereas most Baz/PAR-3 is localized slightly more basally, at the level of the AJs in flies and the tight junctions in vertebrates (Afonso and Henrique, 2006Afonso C.

Furthermore, two conserved threonines in the cytoplasmic tail of Crb are phosphorylated by aPKC, and this is required for Crb activity (Sotillos et al., 2004Sotillos S. Díaz-Meco M.T. Caminero E.

Cell. 2005; 8: 493-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, Baz plays a key role in positioning the AJs in the primary epithelium of Drosophila, as it localizes to the apical/lateral border before Cadherin and Arm, and is required for the coalescence of spot AJs into the zonula adherens (Harris and Peifer, 2005Harris T.J.

Independent cadherin-catenin and Bazooka clusters interact to assemble adherens junctions.J. Cell Biol. 2009; 185: 787-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PAR-3 plays a similar role in the formation of tight junctions in repolarising MDCK cells, and this depends on its interaction with the Rac exchange factor, TIAM1, but is independent of binding to aPKC (Chen and Macara, 2005Chen X. Macara I.G. Par-3 controls tight junction assembly through the Rac exchange factor Tiam1.Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 262-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). The fact that Baz (PAR-3) and PAR-6/aPKC seem to function in different complexes in epithelia raises the question of why Baz does not colocalize with PAR-6 and aPKC, when it can bind directly to both of them. Baz /PAR-3 interacts with the kinase domain of aPKC through its third conserved region (CR3), and PAR-3 has been shown to bind the PDZ domain of PAR-6 through its first PDZ domain (Izumi et al., 1998Izumi Y. Hirose T. Tamai Y. Hirai S. Nagashima Y. Fujimoto T. Tabuse Y. Kemphues K.J. Ohno S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore set out to determine the mechanisms that exclude Baz from the apical aPKC/PAR-6 domain and to investigate whether this is important for the establishment of epithelial polarity in Drosophila. We first examined the localization of Baz and aPKC relative to each other and the AJs in the follicle cells that surround the developing germline cysts of the Drosophila ovary, since these cells form a polarized monolayer that is easily imaged along the apical-basal axis. aPKC localizes to the apical domain of the follicle cells throughout oogenesis (Figures 1A–1C ). Baz localizes slightly more basally than aPKC with a partial overlap in early oogenesis when the follicle cells are cuboidal and is enriched at the apical/lateral junctions (Figure 1A). This difference is more marked once the cells have become columnar at stage 9, when almost all Baz localizes to the AJs with Arm (Figures 1B and 1C). The different positions of Baz and aPKC are reflected in the distinct genetic requirements for the localization of each protein. Removal of Baz abolishes the apical localization of aPKC and PAR-6 at all stages and blocks AJ formation, as seen by the lack of Arm and DE-Cadherin localization in mutant cells (Figures 1D–1F and data not shown) (Abdelilah-Seyfried et al., 2003Abdelilah-Seyfried S. Cox D.N. Jan Y.N. Bazooka is a permissive factor for the invasive behavior of discs large tumor cells in Drosophila ovarian follicular epithelia.Development. 2003; 130: 1927-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). By contrast, Baz localization is largely independent of aPKC and PAR-6. Cuboidal follicle cells mutant for aPKC and par-6 lack the most apical pool of Baz, but the junctional pool is largely unaffected (Figure 1G′ and data not shown). Furthermore, aPKC mutant columnar follicle cells have a wild-type distribution of Baz, even though PAR-6 is unlocalized (Figure 1H). Thus, Baz localizes in the follicle cells independently of aPKC, whereas aPKC localization requires Baz. This is similar to the primary epithelium of embryo, where Baz localizes to the apical/lateral cortex earlier than and independently from aPKC and Par-6, which subsequently localize more apically (Harris and Peifer, 2005Harris T.J. Peifer M. The positioning and segregation of apical cues during epithelial polarity establishment in Drosophila.J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 813-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). These results reinforce the view that Baz and PAR-6/aPKC form distinct complexes in epithelia. We also examined the relationship between aPKC and the Crb complex. Loss of aPKC abolishes the localization of Crb and Patj, and loss of Crb disrupts the localization of aPKC and PAR-6 (Figures 1I–1L). Baz is still localized in crb null mutant cells, however, although the most apical pool of the protein is lost in cuboidal cells, as it is in aPKC mutants (Figures 1J and 1K). These results suggest that PAR-6 and aPKC associate with the Crb complex, whereas Baz is primarily associated with the junctions. Mammalian aPKC phosphorylates PAR-3 on a serine within its aPKC binding site to destabilize the PAR-3/aPKC interaction (Nagai-Tamai et al., 2002Nagai-Tamai Y. Mizuno K. Hirose T. Suzuki A. Ohno S. Regulated protein-protein interaction between aPKC and PAR-3 plays an essential role in the polarization of epithelial cells.Genes Cells. 2002; 7: 1161-1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This site is conserved in Baz (Figure 2A ), suggesting that the regulation of Baz by aPKC phosphorylation may be conserved. To test this, we examined whether Drosophila aPKC can phosphorylate Baz on S980. Since the substrate specificity of aPKC depends on its binding partners, we purified native Drosophila aPKC from embryos by coimmunoprecipitating it with PAR-6:GFP. Purified aPKC phosphorylated the region of Baz containing the aPKC-binding site, but did not phosphorylate the equivalent region with the S980A mutation (Figure 2B). To confirm that aPKC phosphorylates Baz in vivo, we generated phospho-specific antibodies against BazS980-P. These recognized a single band on western blots of ovary extracts, which was strongly reduced after treatment with λ-phosphatase, confirming that the antibodies are specific for BazS980-P and that this site is phosphorylated in vivo (Figure 2C). Furthermore, the P-Baz antibodies recognized wild-type Baz fused to GFP in embryos and ovaries, but not a S980 mutant, further demonstrating their specificity for BazS980-P (Figure S1 available online). The phospho-specific antibodies also specifically detect BazS980-P at the apical side of follicle cells, since no staining is observed after phosphatase treatment or in baz mutant clones (Figure 2D and Figure S1B). BazS980-P staining was abolished in aPKC mutant follicle cell clones, indicating that it is the result of aPKC activity (Figure 2E). Thus, aPKC directly phosphorylates Baz on S980 in vivo at the apical side of the follicle epithelium. Phosphorylation is developmentally regulated, as much lower levels are seen once the cells have undergone the cuboidal to columnar transition (Figure S1A). To address whether the localization of Baz is regulated by aPKC phosphorylation, we expressed nonphosphorylatable (BazS980A) and phosphomimetic (BazS980E) versions of Baz fused to GFP. Wild-type Baz-GFP shows an identical localization to the untagged protein, with most localized to the AJs. By contrast, BazS980A localizes to the apical domain with aPKC, whereas BazS980E concentrates at the AJs (Figures 2F and 2G). The complementary patterns of unphosphorylatable and phosphomimetic Baz are particularly clear in projections: the former forms a cap at the apical side of each cell, whereas the latter forms a lattice around the apical-lateral margins (Figure 2H). These observations indicate that aPKC phosphorylation controls the distribution of Baz: BazS980E, which cannot bind aPKC, is restricted to the apical-lateral border, whereas BazS980A is recruited to the apical domain, presumably by binding to aPKC. Consistent with this, much more aPKC coimmunoprecipitates with BazS980A-GFP than with wild-type Baz or BazS980E from ovary extracts (Figure 2I). To test more directly whether the apical localization of BazS980A depends on binding to aPKC, we examined its localization in aPKC mutant clones. BazS980A no longer localizes apically in mutant cells, and accumulates instead at the apical-lateral boundary (Figure 2J). Thus, phosphorylation by aPKC excludes Baz from the apical domain by preventing its association with aPKC itself. To investigate the functional importance of aPKC phosphorylation of Baz, we tested whether the different Baz transgenes could rescue the baz null phenotype. We first expressed the transgenes with e22cGal4, a constitutive epithelial driver, but BazS980A:GFP was lethal under these conditions. We therefore induced FLPout baz mutant clones in the follicular epithelium in which the different Baz constructs were expressed with Ay-Gal4. baz mutant follicle cells lose their apical-basal polarity and form multiple layers or leave the epithelium entirely, resulting in gaps in the epithelial covering of the germline cyst (Benton and St Johnston, 2003aBenton R. St Johnston D. A conserved oligomerization domain in drosophila Bazooka/PAR-3 is important for apical localization and epithelial polarity.Curr. Biol. 2003; 13: 1330-1334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Wild-type Baz-GFP rescues this phenotype completely (Figure 3A ). Expression of BazS980E-GFP also rescued the baz mutant phenotype, indicating that the interaction between Baz and aPKC is dispensable for normal apical-basal polarity in the follicular epithelium (92% wild-type morphology and aPKC localization, n = 71; Figure 3C). We recovered large baz mutant clones expressing BazS980A-GFP only rarely, and the resulting egg chambers often had large gaps in the follicle cell layer, suggesting that mutant cells fail to integrate into the epithelium. We recovered many small clones induced after the epithelium had formed, but the baz, BazS980A-GFP mutant cells were usually disorganized with aberrant cell shapes (83%, n = 65; Figure 3B). Most BazS980A-expressing mutant cells underwent apical constriction to become wedge shaped, and Arm was often mislocalized apically, where it overlapped with aPKC (Figure 3D). This phenotype suggests that Baz phosphorylation by aPKC is required to establish the boundary between the apical and junctional domains, since AJ proteins localize apically in its absence. baz mutant cells expressing BazS980A-GFP did retain some apical-basal polarity, as the lateral markers, Lgl and Dlg, were still excluded from the apical domain (Figures 3B and 3B′). This shows that BazS980A rescues some Baz functions, and does not disrupt the epithelium by acting as an inhibitor of aPKC's kinase activity, as aPKC activity is required to exclude Lgl from the apical domain. Since BazS980A-GFP is mislocalized to the apical domain, we also asked whether it produced a gain-of-function phenotype when overexpressed with the FLPout/tub-GAL4 system. While wild-type Baz and BazS980E had no effect under these conditions, many BazS980A-expressing cells showed a marked constriction of their apical surfaces, which caused the apical sides of the cells to cluster (Figures 3E and 3E′). In addition, BazS980A expression delayed the cuboidal to columnar transition: clones in the anterior region of the epithelium were usually shorter than their neighbors and were inhibited in their posterior movement to envelop the oocyte (Figure 3F). Finally, BazS980A expression induced the apical localization of Arm with both BazS980A-GFP and aPKC (Figures 3G–3G″. This suggests that BazS980A mislocalizes to the apical domain because it binds aPKC, and then recruits Arm and Cadherin. The apical constriction might then occur because the mislocalized Cadherins in adjacent BazS980A-expressing cells adhere to each other, leading to an apical extension of the AJs that reduces the apical surface area and expands the lateral domain. Baz and aPKC also have distinct localizations and functions during the formation of the primary epithelium of the embryo, raising the possibility that Baz phosphorylation also plays a role in this tissue. Indeed, Baz is phosphorylated in the forming embryonic epithelium and localizes beneath the Crb/aPKC domain (Figure S2A ). Maternal overexpression of wild-type Baz-GFP has no effect on embryogenesis, and the resulting larvae have normal cuticles (Figure 4A ). By contrast, expression of BazS980A at lower levels causes embryos to die with disorganized epithelia that secrete small grains of cuticle, a phenotype that closely resembles that of crumbs mutants (Figure 4B and Figure S1F). Epithelial organization is already severely disrupted by stage 9 of embryogenesis, although the major morphogenetic events still occur (Figures 4C and 4D).Figure 4aPKC Phosphorylation of Baz Is Required in Embryonic EpitheliaShow full caption(A–H) Wild-type embryos overexpressing BazWT:GFP (A, C, and E) or BazS980A:GFP (B, D, F, G, and H) under the control of matα4Gal4-VP16.(A and B) Dark-field images of cuticle preparations of embryos expressing BazWT:GFP (A) or BazS980A:GFP (B).(C and D) Stage 9 embryo expressing BazWT:GFP (green) (C) or BazS980A:GFP (D) stained for aPKC (red), Phospho-Histone 3 (red), and Dlg (blue).(E and F) Cross-sections of regions of the epidermis of stage 9 embryos expressing BazWT:GFP (E) or BazS980A:GFP (F) stained for aPKC (red).(G) Images from fixed BazS980A:GFP embryos at progressive stages of development.(H) Arm (red and as separate channel) aggregates with BazS980A:GFP (green).(I–M) baz"
https://openalex.org/W1982810155,"Changes in postsynaptic membrane composition underlie many forms of learning-related synaptic plasticity in the brain. At excitatory glutamatergic synapses, fusion of intracellular vesicles at or near the postsynaptic plasma membrane is critical for dendritic spine morphology, retrograde synaptic signaling, and long-term synaptic plasticity. Whereas the molecular machinery for exocytosis in presynaptic terminals has been defined in detail, little is known about the location, kinetics, regulation, or molecules involved in postsynaptic exocytosis. Here, we show that an exocytic domain adjacent to the postsynaptic density (PSD) enables fusion of large, AMPA receptor-containing recycling compartments during elevated synaptic activity. Exocytosis occurs at microdomains enriched in the plasma membrane t-SNARE syntaxin 4 (Stx4), and disruption of Stx4 impairs both spine exocytosis and long-term potentiation (LTP) at hippocampal synapses. Thus, Stx4 defines an exocytic zone that directs membrane fusion for postsynaptic plasticity, revealing a novel specialization for local membrane traffic in dendritic spines."

https://openalex.org/W2027225113,"The study of induced pluripotency often relies on experimental approaches that average measurements across a large population of cells, the majority of which do not become pluripotent. Here we used high-resolution, time-lapse imaging to trace the reprogramming process over 2 weeks from single mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to pluripotency factor-positive colonies. This enabled us to calculate a normalized cell-of-origin reprogramming efficiency that takes into account only the initial MEFs that respond to form reprogrammed colonies rather than the larger number of final colonies. Furthermore, this retrospective analysis revealed that successfully reprogramming cells undergo a rapid shift in their proliferative rate that coincides with a reduction in cellular area. This event occurs as early as the first cell division and with similar kinetics in all cells that form induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cell colonies. These data contribute to the theoretical modeling of reprogramming and suggest that certain parts of the reprogramming process follow defined rather than stochastic steps."

AR expression is sparse at the time of the neonatal testosterone surge in mice Estrogen is necessary and sufficient to masculinize AR expression neonatally AR in the nervous system is not necessary for mice to exhibit masculine behaviors AR functions in the nervous system to amplify the extent of male behaviors All sexually reproducing animals exhibit gender dimorphisms in behaviors that are characteristic of the species. Such sex differences in behaviors can be observed in many displays, including in mating, territorial defense, and parental care. Gonadal steroid hormones play a critical role in the neural circuits that mediate sexually dimorphic behaviors: they organize the differentiation of these circuits in the developing animal, and activate these neural pathways to influence sex-specific behaviors in the mature organism. Such an “organizational” effect is thought to lead to irreversible modifications in subsequent behavior, whereas the “activational” function of the hormones results in acute changes in the behavioral repertoire (Arnold et al., 2003Arnold A.P.

Male-typical patterns of behavior are controlled by both testosterone and estrogen in many vertebrates, including mammals. However, the relative contribution of these two hormone signaling pathways to the masculine differentiation of brain and behavior remains to be determined. The requirement of estrogen for male behaviors appears counterintuitive because this circulating ovarian hormone is essentially undetectable in the males of most species. Testosterone, or a related androgen, is an obligate precursor of estrogen, and circulating testosterone in males can be metabolized into estrogen in the brain by the enzyme aromatase (Balthazart and Ball, 1998Balthazart J.

It is this target-derived estrogen that controls male behaviors, and male mice null for aromatase display profound deficits in male-typical mating and aggression (Honda et al., 1998Honda S. Harada N.

The precursor-product relation between testosterone and estrogen raises the possibility that the sole function of testosterone in the neural control of male behaviors is to serve as a circulating prohormone for estrogen (Figure 1A ). Alternatively, testosterone may act not only as a precursor for estrogen, but it may also signal via AR in neurons to drive male behaviors (Figure 1B). Consistent with the latter scenario, male mice constitutively mutant for AR do not mate or fight, and pharmacological studies also indicate a role for this receptor in controlling these behaviors (Finney and Erpino, 1976Finney H.C.

Importantly, these studies do not necessarily distinguish between a peripheral versus a neural-specific function of AR in regulating male behaviors. Moreover, such pharmacological studies often utilized dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to examine AR function, because this steroid is a nonaromatizable androgen. Recent evidence indicates, however, that 3βAdiol, a DHT metabolite found in vivo, is an estrogenic steroid capable of signaling via nuclear estrogen receptors (Ishikawa et al., 2006Ishikawa T.

The use of constitutive AR mutants is also not definitive in defining a role for AR in male behaviors because these animals have low, often undetectable, levels of circulating testosterone (Sato et al., 2004Sato T.

Consequently, the behavioral deficits in constitutive AR mutant males could result solely from inadequate estrogen synthesis and signaling in the brain due to the low levels of circulating testosterone. In contrast to the uncertainty regarding the role of AR in the neural circuits that control male mating and territoriality, the contribution of estrogen signaling to these behaviors is firmly established. Male mice doubly mutant for the nuclear estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ display a complete abrogation of these masculine behaviors despite normal levels of circulating testosterone, indicating that this hormone cannot elicit male-typical sexual and aggressive behaviors solely by signaling via AR (Dupont et al., 2000Dupont S.

Consistent with the apparent nonredundant requirement for these hormones in male mating and fighting, their cognate receptors are expressed in overlapping, but not identical, sexually dimorphic patterns in neuronal populations critical for these behaviors (Pérez et al., 2003Pérez S.E.

Neurol. 1990; 294: 76-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). Thus, AR and ERα and ERβ are widely expressed in interconnected limbic regions such as the medial amygdala (MeA), the posteromedial component of the medial subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), and the preoptic hypothalamus (POA). Despite numerous studies documenting a role for testosterone in male-specific patterning of gene expression and behavior, the extent to which this hormone signals through AR for masculinizing the brain and behavior remains unclear (Juntti et al., 2008Juntti S.A. Coats J.K. Shah N.M. A genetic approach to dissect sexually dimorphic behaviors.Horm. Behav. 2008; 53: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Our findings indicate that AR is unlikely to play a major role in the differentiation of the neural circuits that control male-typical behaviors. We find a surprisingly sparse expression of AR in the developing brain in areas such as the BNST and POA that are thought to be important for dimorphic behaviors. By comparison, the estrogen receptors and aromatase are expressed by many neurons in these regions at birth, and we show that estrogen signaling is necessary and sufficient for the sexual differentiation of AR within these populations. In addition, we find that male mice bearing a nervous-system-restricted deletion of AR exhibit a masculine repertoire of sexual and territorial behaviors with diminutions in specific components of these displays. Adult male mice mutant for AR in the brain have normal levels of circulating testosterone, and these behavioral deficits therefore reflect a requirement for AR in male behaviors rather than inadequate circulating testosterone for estrogen synthesis in the brain. Taken together, our results indicate that testosterone signaling via AR does not control masculine differentiation of the brain and behavior. Rather, AR signaling regulates the extent of male-typical behavioral displays. There is a male-specific transient spike in serum testosterone at birth (postnatal day 1, P1) followed by a sharp drop in circulating titer within 36 hr, and these low baseline levels of testosterone persist until puberty. By contrast, the ovaries are quiescent during the neonatal period, and there is little circulating estrogen (or testosterone) in female pups (McCarthy, 2008McCarthy M.M.

The male-specific surge of testosterone and its subsequent conversion to estrogen is thought to be critical for the sexual differentiation of the neural circuits that control many dimorphic behaviors (Motelica-Heino et al., 1993Motelica-Heino I.

We wished to identify the neurons that respond to this critical testosterone surge via AR at birth. We analyzed AR expression in mice bearing a previously described knockin AR allele (AR-IPIN allele) that permits coexpression of the sensitive, genetically encoded reporter nuclear β-galactosidase (βgal) in all cells that express AR (Shah et al., 2004Shah N.M.

Previous work has implicated AR-expressing regions such as the MeA, the BNST, and the POA as being critical for the display of male-typical mating, aggression, and territorial marking (Commins and Yahr, 1984Commins D.

There were >15- to 90-fold fewer AR-expressing cells in these regions at birth (BNST 12.1 ± 5.7; MeA 16.4 ± 10.3; POA 59.8 ± 20.3; n = 6) than in older animals (Figure 3) (Shah et al., 2004Shah N.M.

Similar results were obtained by directly immunolabeling for AR (data not shown). We could detect more AR-positive cells in the MeA, BNST, and POA at P4, a time point by which the testosterone surge has already subsided (Figures 2D–2F and S1E), but even at this age there appeared to be significantly fewer AR-expressing cells than observed in adults. In contrast to this sparse and faint AR labeling in the BNST, POA, and MeA, AR expression could be reliably detected in a small pool of neurons in the vicinity of the arcuate (ArcN) and ventromedial (VMH) nuclei of the hypothalamus at P1 and P4 (Figures S1A and S1B). The expression pattern of AR in the BNST, POA, and MeA resolved into widespread, intense labeling in these areas at P7, resembling the pattern observed in the adult brain (Figures 2G–2L, S1, and data not shown).Figure 3Sexual Dimorphism in AR ExpressionShow full caption(A–D) Coronal sections through the BNST and POA of P7 mice bearing the AR-IPIN allele immunolabeled for βgal.(E) There are more βgal-positive cells in the BNST and POA of ARIPIN/Y males than in ARIPIN/IPIN females.Mean ± SEM; n = 4 for each genotype, ∗p ≤ 0.005.

The fetal testis produces testosterone from E13 (Crocoll et al., 1998Crocoll A. Zhu C.C. Cato A.C. Blum M. Expression of androgen receptor mRNA during mouse embryogenesis.Mech. Dev. 1998; 72: 175-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and we wondered if this hormone signaled via AR in the prenatal brain to masculinize neural pathways. We did not observe AR in the brain at E13.5, using βgal expression to visualize AR-positive cells in mice bearing the AR-IPIN allele (Figures S2A–S2D). By contrast, at E15.5 and E17.5, we could visualize AR expression in the neurons near the ArcN and VMH, but not in the BNST, POA, or MeA (Figures S2E–S2L). The ontogeny of AR expression in the BNST, POA, and MeA makes it unlikely that this hormone receptor plays a major, cell-autonomous role in masculinizing these neural pathways for male-typical behaviors prenatally or at the time of the neonatal testosterone surge. Previous work demonstrates that adult AR expression is sexually dimorphic such that there are more AR-positive neurons in the BNST, POA, and the basal forebrain in males compared with females (Shah et al., 2004Shah N.M. Pisapia D.J. Maniatis S. Mendelsohn M.M. Nemes A. Axel R. Visualizing sexual dimorphism in the brain.Neuron. 2004; 43: 313-319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). AR expression in the BNST and POA in the P7 male resembles that observed in the adult male (Figures 2G–2L), whereas we did not observe AR-positive cells in the basal forebrain at P7 (data not shown). We asked whether the adult pattern of sexual dimorphism in AR expression was also apparent at P7 in the BNST and POA. Immunolabeling for βgal at P7 revealed significantly more AR-positive cells in the male BNST and POA than in these regions in the female (Figure 3), consistent with previous reports of sexual dimorphism in these regions (McAbee and DonCarlos, 1998McAbee M.D. DonCarlos L.L.

The sexual dimorphism in AR expression is unlikely to arise from testosterone signaling via AR because this receptor is expressed in few cells in these regions at the time of the testosterone surge. Rather, it is likely to result from the autonomous action of forebrain-patterning genes or from estrogen signaling (Arnold et al., 2003Arnold A.P. Rissman E.F. De Vries G.J.

Previous work indicates that both nuclear estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ) and aromatase are expressed in the early neonatal brain (Harada and Yamada, 1992Harada N. Yamada K.

Indeed, we observed abundant expression of ERα and ERβ and aromatase in the BNST and POA at P1 (Figures 4A–4F ), consistent with the notion that testosterone may masculinize AR expression after its conversion into estrogen. If testosterone does masculinize AR expression in the BNST and POA subsequent to aromatization to estrogen, then either of these two hormones should be sufficient to drive male-pattern differentiation of AR in these regions. Indeed, we find that administering testosterone or estrogen to P1 females masculinizes the number of AR-positive cells in the P7 BNST and POA (Figures 4G–4M), consistent with previous pharmacological studies in other vertebrates (Kim et al., 2004Kim Y.H.

To determine whether the conversion of testosterone to estrogen is essential for the development of these sex differences in AR expression, we examined the BNST and POA of P7 aromatase–/– males (Honda et al., 1998Honda S. Harada N. Ito S. Takagi Y. Maeda S. Disruption of sexual behavior in male aromatase-deficient mice lacking exons 1 and 2 of the cyp19 gene.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 252: 445-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In these animals, the number of AR-positive cells is indistinguishable from that observed in control females, and is significantly lower than that in control males (Figures 4G, 4N, and 4O). Taken together, these results show that estrogen controls the sexual differentiation of AR expression in the BNST and POA in males. We note that the few AR-positive cells in the P1 BNST and POA may also respond to the testosterone surge at birth by inducing sexual differentiation of AR in neighboring cells that do not express this receptor; in such a scenario, both estrogen and testosterone signal via their cognate receptors to regulate the sex difference in AR expression in a redundant manner. Nevertheless, our findings demonstrate that estrogen is necessary and sufficient to drive masculinization of AR expression in these brain regions. Our results suggest that"

Although these ploidy-level developmental processes are conserved among bees and wasps, the mechanisms that direct development down a male or female pathway differ significantly. By examining the sex-determining genes in the parasitoid wasp Nasonia , Verhulst et al. (p. 620 ) have shown that a maternal messenger RNA (mRNA) is necessary to initiate the female pathway. The mRNA operates in combination with conserved maternal and paternal genes to produce females, which explains why females are diploids. In unfertilized eggs, maternal provisioning of the gene transcript is too low to initiate the female pathway."

We show that the yeast regulatory locus UASg bears, in addition to binding sites for the activator Gal4, sites bound by the RSC complex. RSC positions a nucleosome, evidently partially unwound, in a structure that facilitates Gal4 binding to its sites. The complex comprises a barrier that imposes characteristic features of chromatin architecture. In the absence of RSC, ordinary nucleosomes encroach over the UASg and compete with Gal4 for binding. Taken with our previous work, the results show that both prior to and following induction, specific DNA-binding proteins are the predominant determinants of chromatin architecture at the GAL1/10 genes. RSC/nucleosome complexes are also found scattered around the yeast genome. Higher eukaryotic RSC lacks the specific DNA-binding determinants found on yeast RSC, and evidently Gal4 works in those organisms despite whatever obstacle broadly positioned nucleosomes present."

Ubiquitin E3 ligases mediate the ubiquitin conjugation reaction at the end of a three-enzyme (E1-E2-E3) cascade, whereas deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) cleave ubiquitin from the substrate polypeptides or polyubiquitin chains. To achieve temporal control, the activities of both ubiquitin ligases and DUBs must be tightly regulated. This is attained at the level of substrate recognition, catalytic competency, subcellular localization, and enzyme abundance. In contrast to the much studied ubiquitin ligases, how DUBs are regulated remains poorly understood. The yeast and human genomes encode close to 20 and 100 DUBs, respectively (Amerik et al., 2000Amerik A.Y. Li S.J. Hochstrasser M.

A recent survey of 75 human DUBs has revealed that most DUBs form protein complexes with multiple interacting partners in the cell (Sowa et al., 2009Sowa M.E. Bennett E.J. Gygi S.P. Harper J.W. Defining the human deubiquitinating enzyme interaction landscape.Cell. 2009; 138: 389-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1083) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs in yeast and USPs in humans) represent the largest subfamily of DUBs. With a conserved catalytic domain, UBP/USPs are characterized by highly variable regions flanking or inserted in the catalytic core (Komander et al., 2009Komander D. Clague M.J. Urbé S. Breaking the chains: structure and function of the deubiquitinases.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 550-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (1264) Google Scholar). Sequence diversities in these regions are believed to dictate UBP/USPs binding to substrates, recruitment of regulatory factors, and integration into unique cellular machinery. Recent structural studies focusing on individual domains of several USPs have revealed a common fold adopted by their homologous catalytic domains, many of which show a considerable degree of structural plasticity (Avvakumov et al., 2006Avvakumov G.V.

Although the conformational changes reported so far are associated with the binding of the ubiquitin moiety of the substrate, they raise immediate questions as to whether the catalytic domains of UBP/USPs can be allosterically regulated by nonsubstrate partners, and how full-length multidomain UBPs/USPs, together with their binding proteins, function in a physiologically relevant form. The yeast Ubp8 protein is an evolutionarily conserved DUB with a functional role in gene expression. Transcription of eukaryotic genes requires dynamic regulation of chromatin structure through coordinated posttranslational modifications of histones. The yeast Spt-Ada-Gcn5-Acetyl transferase (SAGA) complex is a chromatin-modifying transcription coactivator that is best characterized for its histone acetyltransferase activity (HAT) encoded by the central subunit Gcn5 (Daniel and Grant, 2007Daniel J.A.

Purified recombinant Ubp8 can only hydrolyze Ub-AMC, a model ubiquitin conjugate, when Sgf11, Sus1, and Sgf73 are all present (Köhler et al., 2008Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E.

Remarkably, USP22, the human ortholog of Ubp8, forms a similar SAGA DUB module and deubiquitinates both H2A and H2B (Zhang et al., 2008Zhang X.Y. Varthi M. Sykes S.M. Phillips C. Warzecha C. Zhu W.

Here, we report the crystal structure of the entire yeast SAGA DUB module complex, which reveals the mechanisms by which the DUB module assembles and activates Ubp8 for H2B deubiquitination. To assemble a recombinant SAGA DUB module, we coexpressed, purified, and crystallized the full-length Ubp8, Sgf11, and Sus1 and the N-terminal fragment of Sgf73 (amino acids 1–104) as a quaternary complex from E. coli. The complex structure was determined at 2.70 Å resolution by a combination of zinc single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) and molecular replacement (MR) methods (Table S1 available online). The Ubp8-Sgf11-Sus1-Sgf73 complex adopts an overall compact and highly organized structure, which involves extensive protein interaction interfaces (Figures 1A and 1B ). Each subunit of the heterotetrameric complex makes physical contacts with all three other subunits. Overall, the DUB module has two distinct functional lobes, which are organized by two separate domains of the core subunit Ubp8. The N-terminal ZnF-UBP domain of Ubp8 nucleates the other three subunits, forming the “assembly lobe” of the module, whereas the C-terminal catalytic domain of Ubp8 together with Sgf11 C-terminal zinc-finger (ZnF) domain constitutes the “catalytic lobe” (Figure 1A). The two functional lobes of the module are joined together by the Sgf73 N-terminal fragment, which inserts itself in between the two Ubp8 domains. The “assembly lobe” of the DUB module mediates tetrameric complex formation and is characterized by tightly interlocked subunits. At the center of this lobe is a long Sgf11 N-terminal helix, which is completely enclosed by Sus1 and the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain. The “catalytic lobe” of the DUB module features a catalytically competent form of the Ubp8 catalytic domain, which orients its active center and ubiquitin-binding site away from the “assembly lobe” (Figure 1A). The striking highlight of the “catalytic lobe” is an Sgf11 C-terminal sequence, which contains a small zinc-finger domain and a linker sequence connected to the long N-terminal helix. Anchored to the DUB module via the “assembly lobe,” Sgf11 uses this C-terminal sequence to interact with the Ubp8 catalytic domain in the close vicinity of the catalytic triad of the deubiquitinase. The yeast Ubp8 protein belongs to a subfamily of UBP/USPs that share a common ZnF-UBP domain N-terminal to the catalytic domain (Bonnet et al., 2008Bonnet J. Romier C. Tora L. Devys D.

Superposition analysis of the ZnF-UBP domains of Ubp8 and USP5 shows that their central sequence regions have the same core structure, which consists of a five-stranded β sheet with a nearby α helix (S1–S5 and H4 in Ubp8) (Figure 2A ).

The amino acids of S. cerevisiae Ubp8 are numbered. The Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain does not have the ubiquitin tail-binding pocket found in USP5 and USP16. The USP5 ZnF-UBP domain binds the extended C-terminal tail of ubiquitin through a deep pocket formed between the central β sheet and the long L2A loop (Figure 2B). Most ubiquitin-interacting residues inside the pocket, including Arg221 of the L2A loop, are conserved in USP5 and USP16. In contrast, the ZnF-UBP domain of Ubp8 features a much shorter L2A loop and lacks the conserved residues for recognizing ubiquitin. Although a hydrophobic pocket is formed between the L2A loop and the twisted central β sheet, it is mostly occupied by the bulky side chain of the Trp69 residue, which replaces the ubiquitin-interacting arginine found in USP5 and USP16 (Figure 2C). Instead of binding ubiquitin, this site of the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain exposes a hydrophobic surface area that participates in a three-protein junction with residues from Sus1 and Sgf11. The Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain organizes the “assembly lobe” of the DUB module by packing against the central two-thirds of the 40 amino acid long Sgf11 N-terminal helix, contacting two separate regions of Sus1, which wraps around the Sgf11 helix, and interacting with an Sgf73 helix and the following loop (Figure 2D). Joined together as one structural unit, Sus1 and the Sgf11 helix surround half of the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain, opposite to the Sgf73 binding site. The interactions between the Sgf11 helix and the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain mainly involve polar residues and polypeptide backbone groups from both sides. The middle region of the interface, however, is nucleated by hydrophobic interactions predominantly through two aromatic residues of Ubp8, Trp69 and Tyr102 (Figure 2C). At this site, two hydrophobic amino acids, Phe58 and Leu62, on the Sus1 H4 helix also participate in the intermolecular interactions, which all together give rise to a tight three-protein junction. The association among Sus1, Sgf11, and the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain is further reinforced by a second Sus1-Ubp8 interface, which involves the Sus1 H1 helix (Figure 2D). The Sgf73 H2 helix docks to the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain from the opposite side of the zinc-finger fold (Figures 2D and 2E). The N-terminal end of the Sgf73 helix is embedded in a surface groove formed between the Ubp8 H2 helix and a loop coordinating the third zinc ion (Figures 2E and 2F). The hallmark of this Sgf73-Ubp8 interface is the completely buried Sgf73 residue Trp32 and the residue Lys33 covering it (Figure 2F). Each donating a hydrogen bond to a backbone carbonyl group of Ubp8, these two Sgf73 amino acids are strictly conserved in yeast species, suggesting a key role in anchoring Sgf73 to the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain. Overall, the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain serves as an assembly scaffold, holding all subunits of the module together. To verify our structural analysis, we constructed two Ubp8 truncation mutants to test whether the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain itself is indeed sufficient for associating with the other three subunits of the DUB module. As shown in Figure 2G, a Ubp8 fragment representing the minimal Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain (Ubp8 1–107), but not one lacking the last two β strands and the C-terminal sequence (Ubp8 1–82), can form a stable complex with Sgf11, Sus1, and Sgf73. Furthermore, the ability of the truncated Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain (Ubp8 1–82) to interact with Sgf73 but not with Sus1 is consistent with two separate subunit interfaces as revealed by the crystal structure (compare lanes 3 and 6). Sus1 is a bifunctional protein serving as a critical subunit of the SAGA DUB module and the TREX-2 complex, a messenger RNA (mRNA) export machinery formed by three additional subunits, Sac3, Cdc31, and Thp1 (Rodríguez-Navarro et al., 2004Rodríguez-Navarro S. Fischer T. Luo M.J. Antúnez O. Brettschneider S. Lechner J. Pérez-Ortín J.E. Reed R. Hurt E. Sus1, a functional component of the SAGA histone acetylase complex and the nuclear pore-associated mRNA export machinery.Cell. 2004; 116: 75-86Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). On the basis of the physical association of the two complexes mediated by Sgf73 (amino acids 227–402) and a role of Sus1 in TREX-2 targeting, both proteins have been proposed to participate in connecting transcription and mRNA export at the nuclear pore, a process known as “gene gating” (Köhler et al., 2008Köhler A. Schneider M. Cabal G.G. Nehrbass U. Hurt E. Yeast Ataxin-7 links histone deubiquitination with gene gating and mRNA export.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Previous crystallographic studies of Sus1 in complex with a Sac3 C-terminal domain and Cdc31 have shown that two Sus1 molecules, each adopting a common hinged helical hairpin fold, interact with Sac3 by sequentially wrapping around a long continuous Sac3 helix (Jani et al., 2009Jani D. Lutz S. Marshall N.J. Fischer T. Köhler A. Ellisdon A.M. Hurt E. Stewart M. Sus1, Cdc31, and the Sac3 CID region form a conserved interaction platform that promotes nuclear pore association and mRNA export.Mol. Cell. 2009; 33: 727-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the “assembly lobe” of the DUB module, Sus1 folds into essentially the same spiral clamp conformation and binds to the long Sgf11 N-terminal helix in a similar fashion. However, distinct from its simple role of gripping long helical structures in the partial TREX-2 complex, Sgf11-bound Sus1 in the DUB module uses its H1 and H4 helices to form two additional protein interfaces with the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain (Figure 2D). As a result, the Sgf11 helix becomes entirely enclosed by Sus1 and the ZnF-UBP domain of Ubp8 (Figure 3A ), losing its freedom to dissociate without disrupting the three-protein complex. Intriguingly, an Sgf73 N-terminal sequence further secures the Sgf11-Sus1 complex by capping the elongated complex at one end. Connected to the Ubp8-interacting H2 helix via a disordered loop, the Sgf73 H1 helix and its N-terminal sequence interact with the N-terminal H1 and C-terminal H5 helices of Sus1 while overarching to the N-terminal end of the nearby Sgf11 helix (Figure 2D). A number of hydrophobic residues from Sgf73, Sus1, and Sgf11 congregate and form a hydrophobic core of yet another three-protein junction interface (Figure 3B). A comparison of the Sus1-Sgf11 complex of the DUB module and a Sus1-Sac3 subcomplex readily reveals that Sus1 is an adaptable α helix clamp with a considerable degree of structural plasticity. When the H2 and H5 helices of Sus1 in the two complexes are superimposed, it becomes clear that Sus1 recognizes the overall shape and hydrophobic surface pattern of the target helix instead of specific residues. In fact, the helical polypeptide backbones of the Sgf11 and Sac3 helices interfaced with the same H2 and H5 helices of Sus1 are significantly shifted in the superimposed structure (Figure 3C). Moreover, the remaining three helices of Sus1 have to undergo substantial movements around the hinge regions in between helices to transit from one structural state to the other in the two complexes (Figure 3D). For example, the Ubp8-interacting residue at the tip of the Sus1 H4 helix in the Sus1-Sgf11 complex (Figure 2C) is separated from its position in the Sus1-Sac3 complex by nearly 7 Å (Figure 3D). Overall, the two distal ends of the Sus1 clamp, i.e., the N-terminal tips of the H1 and H4 helices of Sus1, appear to be closer to each other in the DUB module. This feature is also associated with a slight bending of the Sgf11 helix in the middle (Figures 3D and 3E). Interestingly, both distal ends of the Sus1 molecule and the middle region of the Sgf11 helix make direct contacts with the Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain in the DUB module (Figure 2D), implicating that an induced-fit mechanism might be involved in the cooperative assembly of the protein complex. Consistent with the spatial arrangement and a multiple intersubunit crosstalk, the minimal Ubp8 ZnF-UBP domain can efficiently pull down Sus1 and Sgf11 only when both are present in an in vitro binding assay (Figure 3F). Tightened together in the “assembly lobe” via their N-terminal regions, Ubp8 and Sgf11 join their C-terminal regions to constitute the “catalytic lobe” of the DUB module. According to the published nomenclature (Hu et al., 2002H"

How the CED-4 apoptosome assembles and activates CED-3 remains enigmatic. Here we report the crystal structure of the complete CED-4 apoptosome and show that it consists of eight CED-4 molecules, organized as a tetramer of an asymmetric dimer via a previously unreported interface among AAA(+) ATPases. These eight CED-4 molecules form a funnel-shaped structure. The mature CED-3 protease is monomeric in solution and forms an active holoenzyme with the CED-4 apoptosome, within which the protease activity of CED-3 is markedly stimulated. Unexpectedly, the octameric CED-4 apoptosome appears to bind only two, not eight, molecules of mature CED-3. The structure of the CED-4 apoptosome reveals shared principles for the NB-ARC family of AAA(+) ATPases and suggests a mechanism for the activation of CED-3."
https://openalex.org/W1976656874,"We reported that gene-selective formation of facultative heterochromatin silences transcription of acute inflammatory genes during endotoxin (LPS) tolerance, according to function. We discovered that reversal of the epigenetically silenced transcription restored mRNA levels but not protein synthesis. Here, we find that translation repression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) occurs independent of transcription silencing during LPS tolerance. The process required to disrupt protein synthesis followed Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-dependent induction of microRNA (miR)-221, miR-579, and miR-125b, which coupled with RNA-binding proteins TTP, AUF1, and TIAR at the 3'-untranslated region to arrest protein synthesis. TTP and AUF1 proteins linked to miR-221, whereas TIAR coupled with miR-579 and miR-125b. Functional inhibition of miR-221 prevented TNFalpha mRNA degradation, and blocking miR-579 and miR-125b precluded translation arrest. The functional specificity of the TNFalpha 3'-untranslated region was demonstrated using luciferase reporter with mutations in the three putative miRNA binding sites. Post-transcriptional silencing was gene-specific, because it did not affect production of the IkappaBalpha anti-inflammatory protein. These results suggest that TLR4-dependent reprogramming of inflammatory genes is regulated at two separate and distinct levels. The first level of control is mediated by epigenetic modifications at the promoters that control transcription. The second and previously unrecognized level of control is mediated by TLR4-dependent differential expression of miRNAs that exert post-transcriptional controls. The concept of distinct regulation of transcription and translation was confirmed in murine sepsis. We conclude that transcription- and translation-repressive events combine to tightly regulate pro-inflammatory genes during LPS tolerance, a common feature of severe systemic inflammation."

Neurons from patients and the mouse Fmr1 knockout (KO) model are characterized by an excess of dendritic spines, suggesting a deficit in excitatory synapse elimination. In response to neuronal activity, myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors induce robust synapse elimination. Here, we demonstrate that MEF2 activation fails to eliminate functional or structural excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons from Fmr1 KO mice. Similarly, inhibition of endogenous MEF2 increases synapse number in wild-type but not Fmr1 KO neurons. MEF2-dependent synapse elimination is rescued in Fmr1 KO neurons by acute postsynaptic expression of wild-type but not RNA-binding mutants of FMRP. Our results reveal that active MEF2 and FMRP function together in an acute, cell-autonomous mechanism to eliminate excitatory synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1966689324,"Common factors are thought to control vascular and neuronal patterning. Here we report an in vivo requirement for the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR2) in axon tract formation in the mouse brain. We show that VEGFR2 is expressed by neurons of the subiculum and mediates axonal elongation in response to the semaphorin (Sema) family molecule, Sema3E. We further show that VEGFR2 associates with the PlexinD1/Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) receptor complex for Sema3E and becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon Sema3E stimulation. In subicular neurons, Sema3E triggers VEGFR2-dependent activation of the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway that is required for the increase in axonal growth. These results implicate VEGFR2 in axonal wiring through a mechanism dependent on Sema3E and independent of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) ligands. This mechanism provides an explanation as to how a semaphorin can activate an axon growth promoting response in developing neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2058604097,"Endocannabinoids are widely regarded as negative modulators of presynaptic release. Here, we present evidence that in visual cortex endocannabinoids are crucial for the maturation of GABAergic release. We found that between eye opening and puberty, release changes from an immature state with high release probability, short-term depression (STD), and high release variability during irregular patterned activity, to a mature state with reduced release probability, STD, and variability. This transition requires visual experience and stimulation of CB1 cannabinoid receptors as it is mimicked by administration of CB1 agonists, blocked by antagonists, and is absent in CB1R KO mice. In immature slices, activation of CB1 receptors induces long-term depression of inhibitory responses (iLTD) and a reduction in STD and response variability. Based on these findings, we propose that visually induced endocannabinoid-dependent iLTD mediates the developmental decrease in release probability, STD, and response variability, which are characteristic of maturation of cortical GABAergic inhibition."

The initial electron transfer generates a charge-separated state that must be stabilized to prevent dissipation of energy through recombination. Wöhri et al. (p. 630 ) have used time-resolved Laue diffraction crystallography to observe light-induced conformational changes that occur within milliseconds of photooxidation of the dimer of bacteriochlorophyll molecules, known as the “special pair,” in the photosynthetic reaction center of Blastochloris viridis . Stabilization appears to occur because of the deprotonation of a conserved tyrosine residue that moves closer to the special pair."
https://openalex.org/W2073440759,"Homeostatic control of neural function can be mediated by the regulation of ion channel expression, neurotransmitter receptor abundance, or modulation of presynaptic release. These processes can be implemented through cell autonomous or intercellular signaling. It remains unknown whether different forms of homeostatic regulation can be coordinated to achieve constant neural function. One way to approach this question is to confront a simple neural system with conflicting perturbations and determine whether the outcome reflects a coordinated, homeostatic response. Here, we demonstrate that two A-type potassium channel genes, shal and shaker, are reciprocally, transcriptionally coupled to maintain A-type channel expression. We then demonstrate that this homeostatic control of A-type channel expression prevents target-dependent, homeostatic modulation of synaptic transmission. Thus, we uncover a homeostatic mechanism that reciprocally regulates A-type potassium channels, and we define a hierarchical relationship between cell-intrinsic control of ion channel expression and target-derived homeostatic control of synaptic transmission."

This Essay discusses the host restriction factor tetherin, which blocks the release of enveloped viruses like HIV-1, and the factors evolved by primate lentiviruses, such as Vpu and Nef, that antagonize tetherin's action. Mammalian cells are equipped with so-called “restriction factors” that suppress virus replication and help to prevent virus transmission from one species to another. This Essay discusses the host restriction factor tetherin, which blocks the release of enveloped viruses like HIV-1, and the factors evolved by primate lentiviruses, such as Vpu and Nef, that antagonize tetherin's action. Constant exposure to a wide variety of viral pathogens during human evolution has shaped our genetic material. Indeed, ∼8% of our genome consists of the defective remnants of once-infectious retroviruses. Recent data suggest that these continuous encounters with viral pathogens over millions of years have driven the evolution of antiviral host factors that may help to control virus spread and to prevent cross-species transmission of viral pathogens. These so called “host restriction” factors are components of the innate immune response and interfere with different stages of the virus life cycle. They can be constitutively expressed or may be induced by interferon-α (IFN-α) during induction of the innate immune response by viral infection. There are three main classes of restriction factors that are effective against retroviruses: cytidine deaminases such as APOBEC3G (apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme 3G), which induces lethal hypermutations in the retroviral genome; TRIM5α (tripartite motif protein 5α) proteins, which restrict the incoming retroviral capsid; and tetherin (also known as BST-2, CD317, or HM1.24), which impedes the release of newly formed virions of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) and other enveloped viruses from the host cell surface (Malim and Emerman, 2008Malim M.H. Emerman M. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 388-398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, Neil and Bieniasz, 2009Neil S. Bieniasz P. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2009; 29: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Usually, these factors efficiently restrict retroviral infection, but, as a counterstrike, viruses have evolved specific antagonists to oppose their action. For example, in HIV-1 and the closely related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVs), the viral proteins Vpu or Nef interfere with the action of tetherin. Here, we summarize our current knowledge of tetherin and speculate on its possible role in the pathogenesis and spread of HIV-1. The host restriction factor tetherin was discovered a few years ago by the groups of Bieniasz and Guatelli (Neil et al., 2008Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar, Van Damme et al., 2008Van Damme N. Goff D. Katsura C. Jorgenson R.L. Mitchell R. Johnson M.C. Stephens E.B. Guatelli J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). It has long been known that the Vpu protein of HIV-1 is required for efficient release of viral particles from certain cell types (e.g., HeLa cells) but not from others (e.g., COS-7 cells) (Strebel et al., 1989Strebel K. Klimkait T. Maldarelli F. Martin M.A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3784-3791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Göttlinger et al., 1993Göttlinger H.G. Dorfman T. Cohen E.A. Haseltine W.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1993; 90: 7381-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Heterokaryons formed between HeLa cells and COS-7 cells showed the characteristics of HeLa cells, suggesting the expression of a dominant restrictive factor that is antagonized by Vpu (Varthakavi et al., 2003Varthakavi V. Smith R.M. Bour S.P. Strebel K. Spearman P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 15154-15159Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). This factor is induced by type I interferons and efficiently tethers virions to the host cell surface (Neil et al., 2007Neil S.J. Sandrin V. Sundquist W.I. Bieniasz P.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Bieniasz and colleagues identified this factor as BST-2/tetherin by using microarray analyses to compare the expression of genes encoding membrane-associated proteins that were constitutively expressed in cells where Vpu was required for efficient virion release versus cells where Vpu was only required after IFN-α treatment (Neil et al., 2008Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). Independently, Van Damme et al., 2008Van Damme N. Goff D. Katsura C. Jorgenson R.L. Mitchell R. Johnson M.C. Stephens E.B. Guatelli J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar identified BST-2/tetherin by extending work showing that BST-2 is downmodulated by the Vpu protein of HIV-1 and by the K5 protein of Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus (KSHV) (Bartee et al., 2006Bartee E. McCormack A. Früh K. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e107Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Tetherin is a 30–36 kDa type II single-pass transmembrane protein. It comprises a cytoplasmic N-terminal region, followed by a transmembrane domain, a coiled-coil extracellular domain, and a C-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Kupzig et al., 2003Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The ectodomain of tetherin contains two N-linked glycosylation sites and three cysteine residues that mediate homodimerization. The extracellular core region of tetherin forms a parallel disulfide-linked coiled-coil domain, and the entire extracellular domain may adopt an extended 170 Å long rod-like structure (Hinz et al., 2010Hinz A. Miguet N. Natrajan G. Usami Y. Yamanaka H. Renesto P. Hartlieb B. McCarthy A.A. Simorre J.-P. Gottlinger H. Weissenborn W. Cell Host Microbe. 2010; (Published online April 15, 2010)https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chom2010,03.005Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the coiled-coil domain of tetherin contains several conserved destabilizing amino acid residues, possibly providing sufficient conformational flexibility to enable the GPI anchor to be inserted into the budding virion envelope and the transmembrane domain to be embedded in the host cell plasma membrane. The topology of tetherin with both a GPI anchor and a transmembrane domain is highly unusual and is only shared by an isoform of the prion protein (Moore et al., 1999Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. et al.J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 797-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Notably, the GPI anchor enables tetherin to be targeted to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts in the plasma membrane (Kupzig et al., 2003Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), the preferential site for HIV virion budding. Tetherin is usually only expressed efficiently in plasmacytoid dendritic cells, some cancer cells, terminally differentiated B cells, and bone marrow stromal cells (Blasius et al., 2006Blasius A.L. Giurisato E. Cella M. Schreiber R.D. Shaw A.S. Colonna M. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 3260-3265Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). However, its expression is strongly induced by type I IFNs (Neil et al., 2007Neil S.J. Sandrin V. Sundquist W.I. Bieniasz P.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Induction of IFN expression by HIV-1 in vitro involves binding of HIV-1 virions to the CD4 receptor on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (the major producers of IFN), endocytosis of the virions, and triggering of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 and 9 by viral nucleic acids in endosomes (Figure 1) (Beignon et al., 2005Beignon A.S. McKenna K. Skoberne M. Manches O. DaSilva I. Kavanagh D.G. Larsson M. Gorelick R.J. Lifson J.D. Bhardwaj N. J. Clin. Invest. 2005; 115: 3265-3275Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, Haupt et al., 2008Haupt S. Donhauser N. Chaipan C. Schuster P. Puffer B. Daniels R.S. Greenough T.C. Kirchhoff F. Schmidt B.

Feinberg M.B. Nat. Med. 2008; 14: 1077-1087Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Type I IFNs induce expression of several hundred different genes and activate natural killer cells, myeloid dendritic cells, T and B cells, and macrophages. Tetherin expression is induced by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway after binding of IFN-α and IFN-β to their receptors (Figure 1). Notably, the tetherin gene promoter contains various response elements, suggesting that other inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNFα, may also induce its expression. Tetherin moves cotranslationally into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and is transported first to the compartments of the Golgi apparatus via COPII-coated vesicles and finally to the plasma membrane (Figure 1). It binds to AP2 adaptor complexes via conserved tyrosines in its cytoplasmic tail, is internalized via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and cycles between the cell surface and the trans-Golgi network (Rollason et al., 2007Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Schu P. Banting G. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3850-3858Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). To prevent immune hyperactivation, tetherin binds to immunoglobulin-like transcript 7 (ILT7) on plasmacytoid dendritic cells and inhibits the expression of type I IFNs and other proinflammatory cytokines in a negative feedback loop (Cao et al., 2009Cao W. Bover L. Cho M. Wen X. Hanabuchi S. Bao M. Rosen D.B. Wang Y.H. Shaw J.L. Du Q. et al.J. Exp. Med. 2009; 206: 1603-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The inefficient release of HIV-1 virions in the absence of the viral factor Vpu as a result of the action of tetherin is associated with the accumulation of virions at the plasma membrane and within intracellular clathrin-coated endosomal structures (Neil et al., 2006Neil S.J. Eastman S.W. Jouvenet N. Bieniasz P.D. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The virions trapped at the cell surface are infectious and can be released by physical shearing or subtilisin treatment (Neil et al., 2006Neil S.J. Eastman S.W. Jouvenet N. Bieniasz P.D. PLoS Pathog. 2006; 2: e39Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, Kaletsky et al., 2009Kaletsky R.L. Francica J.R. Agrawal-Gamse C. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Importantly, the inhibitory mechanism is relatively nonspecific, as tetherin restricts the release of different retroviruses, including alpha-, beta-, delta-, spuma-, and lentiviruses, arenaviruses (Lassa), filoviruses (Marburg, Ebola), and herpesviruses (KSHV) (Göttlinger et al., 1993Göttlinger H.G.

The fact that tetherin contains two membrane anchors suggests that it may directly tether newly forming virions to host cells. Bieniasz and colleagues have shown that it is the unusual structure of tetherin and not the primary sequence that determines its antiviral activity (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These authors generated an artificial protein with a different amino acid sequence but comparable topology and found that it efficiently inhibits virus release. Thus, tetherin may not need a cofactor but rather tethers virions directly to the plasma membrane and to one another (Figure 1). This simple mechanism is in agreement with the finding that removal of either the cytoplasmic tail or the GPI anchor abolishes the antiviral activity of tetherin (Neil et al., 2008Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D. Nature. 2008; 451: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (1422) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether it is the transmembrane domain or the GPI anchor of tetherin that is inserted into the viral envelope. However, the observation that tetherin can also tether virions to one another implies that both domains can be incorporated into viral membranes. But many questions remain including the role of dimerization in the tethering mechanism. Dimerization seems to be critical for tetherin's inhibition of the release of HIV-1 virions (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) but not of filovirus particles (Sakuma et al., 2009Sakuma T. Noda T. Urata S. Kawaoka Y. Yasuda J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 2382-2385Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is still not clear whether the association of tetherin with lipid rafts and its interaction with the actin cytoskeleton help to recruit this restriction factor to sites of virus budding (Kupzig et al., 2003Kupzig S. Korolchuk V. Rollason R. Sugden A. Wilde A. Banting G. Traffic. 2003; 4: 694-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, Rollason et al., 2009Rollason R. Korolchuk V. Hamilton C. Jepson M. Banting G. J. Cell Biol. 2009; 184: 721-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Recent data suggest that the RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase breast cancer-associated gene 2 (BCA2; also called Rabring7, ZNF364, or RNF115) accelerates the internalization and degradation of tethered HIV-1 virions and may thus be a cofactor for tetherin (Miyakawa et al., 2009Miyakawa K. Ryo A. Murakami T. Ohba K. Yamaoka S. Fukuda M. Guatelli J. Yamamoto N. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: 1000700Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Also, it is not known whether endocytosed tethered virions are generally degraded in lysosomes or whether they may remain intact and cycle back to the cell surface. Tetherin was discovered because it is antagonized by the HIV-1 protein Vpu. This accessory viral factor is a 16 kDa type 1 transmembrane protein that seems to interact directly with the transmembrane domain of tetherin. This interaction is highly specific as single point mutations in tetherin's transmembrane domain render it resistant to Vpu (McNatt et al., 2009McNatt M.W. Zang T. Hatziioannou T. Bartlett M. Fofana I.B. Johnson W.E. Neil S.J. Bieniasz P.D. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, Gupta et al., 2009Gupta R.K. Hué S. Schaller T. Verschoor E. Pillay D. Towers G.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: 1000443Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Vpu leads to moderately reduced levels of tetherin at the host cell surface and a modest decrease in total cellular tetherin (Van Damme et al., 2008Van Damme N. Goff D. Katsura C. Jorgenson R.L.

This may be achieved by targeting tetherin to the trans-Golgi network or to early endosomes for proteasomal or lysosomal degradation by a β-TrCP-dependent mechanism (Douglas et al., 2009Douglas J.L.

PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000574Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) (Table S1 available online). However, mutations in the TrCP-binding motif in Vpu do not entirely disrupt its ability to antagonize tetherin and promote virion release (Schubert and Strebel, 1994Schubert U. Strebel K. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Van Damme et al., 2008Van Damme N. Goff D. Katsura C. Jorgenson R.L. Mitchell R. Johnson M.C. Stephens E.B. Guatelli J. Cell Host Microbe. 2008; 3: 245-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar), and downmodulation of tetherin may not always be required for Vpu to promote virion release (Miyagi et al., 2009Miyagi E. Andrew A.J. Kao S. Strebel K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 2868-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, Neil et al., 2008Neil S.J. Zang T. Bieniasz P.D.

PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000856Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Thus, the exact mechanisms of tetherin downmodulation from the cell surface and intracellular degradation or sequestration, as well as the relative contribution of these effects to Vpu-dependent enhancement of virion release, remain to be determined. Most primate lentiviruses do not contain a vpu gene. Indeed, some primate lentiviruses (e.g., SIVsmm, SIVmac, SIVsyk, and SIVagm from sooty mangabeys, macaques, Syke's monkeys, and African green monkeys, respectively) use their Nef proteins to antagonize tetherin (Jia et al., 2009Jia B.

Surprisingly, SIVcpz from chimpanzees and SIVgor from gorillas, which contain Vpu and are the ancestors of HIV-1, also use Nef to block tetherin. Nef is a myristoylated protein that is critical for efficient viral replication in vivo and manipulates cellular trafficking, signal transduction, and gene expression in host cells. How Nef antagonizes tetherin is unclear, but Nef is known to act as an adaptor protein, interacting with the cytoplasmic domains of CD4, CD28, and class I MHC molecules and downmodulating their expression by recruiting them to the endocytic machinery or re-routing them to lysosomes for degradation. Nef also targets the cytoplasmic tail of tetherin and reduces its expression at the host cell surface (Jia et al., 2009Jia B. Serra-Moreno R. Neidermyer W. Rahmberg A. Mackey J. Fofana I.B. Johnson W.E. Westmoreland S. Evans D.T. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: 1000429Crossref Scopus (323) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F. Wilson S.J. Landford W.C. Virgen B. Gregory D. Johnson M.C.

Certain mutations in Nef that disrupt its effect on tetherin also abolish CD4 downregulation implicating a similar mechanism in both events, such as AP2-dependent endocytosis and lysosomal degradation. In contrast to its direct simian precursor (SIVsmm from naturally infected sooty mangabeys; Gao et al., 1992Gao F. Yue L. White A.T. Pappas P.G. Barchue J. Hanson A.P. Greene B.M. Sharp P.M. Shaw G.M. Hahn B.H. Nature. 1992; 358: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), HIV-2 uses its envelope glycoprotein Env (and not Nef) to antagonize tetherin by sequestering it away from sites of virus assembly (Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009Le Tortorec A. Neil S.J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 11966-11978Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The Env glycoprotein of HIV-2 seems to interact directly with the ectodomain of tetherin, and its ability to promote virus release requires an intact Gyxxθ motif that binds to AP2 and targets it for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Interestingly, SIVtan from Tantalus monkeys uses both Env and Nef to antagonize tetherin (Gupta et al., 2009Gupta R.K. Hué S. Schaller T. Verschoor E. Pillay D. Towers G.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: 1000443Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F. Wilson S.J. Landford W.C. Virgen B. Gregory D. Johnson M.C. Munch J. Kirchhoff F. Bieniasz P.D. Hatziioannou T. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 54-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). It is not known whether simple retroviruses that do not encode Vpu or Nef can use Env to counteract tetherin or whether they do not require a tetherin antagonist because they do not induce an inflammatory type I IFN response. Herpesviruses and filoviruses encode tetherin antagonists; KSHV uses K5/MIR2, a viral member of the membrane-associated RING-CH ubiquitin ligase family, to ubiquitinate tetherin at lysines K18 and K28 and target it for degradation (Mansouri et al., 2009Mansouri M. Viswanathan K. Douglas J.L. Hines J. Gustin J. Moses A.V. Früh K. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 9672-9681Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Tetherin-mediated restriction of filovirus budding is antagonized by the Ebola virus glycoprotein (Kaletsky et al., 2009Kaletsky R.L. Francica J.R. Agrawal-Gamse C. Bates P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2009; 106: 2886-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar), but this does not seem to involve a reduction in tetherin expression. Like the HIV-2 and SIVtan Env glycoproteins, the Ebola virus glycoprotein may sequester tetherin away from the site of virus budding (Table S1). Genes encoding host restriction factors show strong evidence for positive selection and have evolved rapidly. This diversifying selection is most likely driven by the need to combat new emerging pathogens or new viral antagonist proteins. As a consequence, these antiviral factors show a high degree of sequence divergence and may constitute barriers to zoonotic viral transmission from animal reservoirs because the viral antagonists often act in a species-specific manner. For example, the HIV-1 Vpu protein antagonizes human but not monkey tetherin (Gupta et al., 2009Gupta R.K. Hué S. Schaller T. Verschoor E. Pillay D. Towers G.J. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: 1000443Crossref Scopus (164) Google Scholar, McNatt et al., 2009McNatt M.W. Zang T. Hatziioannou T. Bartlett M. Fofana I.B. Johnson W.E. Neil S.J. Bieniasz P.D. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000300Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), whereas the Vpu proteins of SIVgsn, SIVmon, and SIVmus show the opposite phenotype and counteract monkey but not human or ape tetherins (Sauter et al., 2009Sauter D. Schindler M. Specht A. Landford W.N. Münch J. Kim K.-A. Votteler J. Schubert U. Bibollet-Ruche F. Keele B.F. et al.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, primate lentiviruses are well known for their ability to cross species barriers and to adapt rapidly to a new host environment (Figure 2A ). SIVcpz most likely arose from a recombination event between ancestors of SIVs that presently infect Red-capped mangabeys and Cercopithecus monkeys (Bailes et al., 2003Bailes E. Gao F. Bibollet-Ruche F. Courgnaud V. Peeters M. Marx P.A. Hahn B.H. Sharp P.M. Science. 2003; 300: 1713Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Subsequently, SIVcpz was transmitted from chimpanzees to gorillas, giving rise to SIVgor, and to humans, giving rise to pandemic group M, rare group N, and (possibly) nonpandemic group O strains of HIV-1 (Van Heuverswyn and Peeters, 2007Van Heuverswyn F. Peeters M. Curr. Infect. Dis. Rep. 2007; 9: 338-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). A new virus (designated HIV-1 group P) that is closely related to SIVgor and most likely was transmitted from gorillas to humans has been recently identified (Plantier et al., 2009Plantier J.C. Leoz M. Dickerson J.E. De Oliveira F. Cordonnier F. Lemée V. Damond F. Robertson D.L. Simon F. Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 871-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). How do these primate lentiviruses antagonize tetherin? The ancestor of SIVrcm most likely used Nef to antagonize tetherin (because SIVrcm does not have Vpu), and the ancestor of the SIVgsn/mus/mon lineage most probably used Vpu (because its descendants do) (Sauter et al., 2009Sauter D. Schindler M. Specht A. Landford W.N. Münch J. Kim K.-A. Votteler J. Schubert U. Bibollet-Ruche F. Keele B.F. et al.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Phylogenetic analyses suggest that SIVcpz received the vpu gene from the predecessor of the SIVgsn/mus/mon lineage and nef from the SIVrcm lineage (Schindler et al., 2006Schindler M. Münch J. Kutsch O. Li H. Santiago M.L. Bibollet-Ruche F. Müller-Trutwin M.C. Novembre F.J. Peeters M. Courgnaud V. et al.Cell. 2006; 125: 1055-1067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The transmembrane domain of chimpanzee and monkey tetherin that is targeted by Vpu differs by seven amino acids and a small deletion (Figure 2B). The cytoplasmic domain of tetherin that seems to interact with Nef is less divergent, which may explain why Nef and not Vpu evolved to become an effective tetherin antagonist in SIVcpz-infected chimpanzees. After zoonotic transmission of SIVcpz from chimpanzees to gorillas the Nef of SIVgor was able to adapt rapidly to antagonize gorilla tetherin because the cytoplasmic domain of gorilla and chimpanzee tetherin differs by only two amino acids. However, human tetherin is resistant to Nef because there is a five amino acid deletion in its cytoplasmic domain (Figure 2B), which may have evolved to escape the protein antagonists of ancient lentiviruses (Zhang et al., 2009Zhang F. Wilson S.J. Landford W.C. Virgen B. Gregory D. Johnson M.C. Munch J. Kirchhoff F. Bieniasz P.D. Hatziioannou T. Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 54-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This deletion poses a significant barrier for viral transmission from chimpanzees to humans and most likely forced HIV-1 to switch from Nef to Vpu to counteract tetherin in its new human host (Figure 2C). Notably, only pandemic HIV-1 M strains mastered this hurdle perfectly by regaining efficient Vpu-mediated antitetherin activity. In contrast, the Vpu proteins of HIV-1 O and P strains are poor tetherin antagonists, and those of the rare HIV-1 group N strains gained some antitetherin activity but lost the ability to degrade CD4 (Sauter et al., 2009Sauter D. Schindler M. Specht A. Landford W.N. Münch J. Kim K.-A. Votteler J. Schubert U. Bibollet-Ruche F. Keele B.F. et al.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar; D.S., A.S., and F.K., unpublished data). The sequence variations underlying these differences in Vpu function among the different HIV-1 strains remain to be elucidated. The resistance of human tetherin to Nef may also explain why HIV-2, which originated from SIVsmm, switched from Nef to the Env glycoprotein in order to suppress tetherin's action (Le Tortorec and Neil, 2009Le Tortorec A. Neil S.J. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 11966-11978Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Figure 2C). The fact that viruses have developed highly specific tools to antagonize tetherin clearly suggests that this host restriction factor is a significant inhibitor of virus replication in vivo. However, the importance of the type I IFN immune response and of tetherin antagonists for control of HIV-1 replication in vivo and for HIV-1 pathogenesis remains to be fully defined. Chimeric SIVmac constructs expressing the HIV-1 nef gene (SHIV) can cause fatal disease in macaques (Alexander et al., 1999Alexander L. Du Z. Howe A.Y. Czajak S. Desrosiers R.C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 5814-5825PubMed Google Scholar, Kirchhoff et al., 1999Kirchhoff F. Münch J. Carl S. Stolte N. Mätz-Rensing K. Fuchs D. Haaft P.T. Heeney J.L. Swigut T. Skowronski J. Stahl-Hennig C. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8371-8383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the Nef of HIV-1 is unable to antagonize tetherin. HIV-1 O strains show reduced replicative fitness in cell culture and spread less efficiently in the human population than the HIV-1 M strain but can cause AIDS (Mauclère et al., 1997Mauclère P. Loussert-Ajaka I. Damond F. Fagot P. Souquières S. Monny Lobe M. Mbopi Keou F.X. Barré-Sinoussi F. Saragosti S. Brun-Vézinet F. et al.AIDS. 1997; 15: 445-453Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) even though their Vpu and Nef proteins are poor tetherin antagonists (Sauter et al., 2009Sauter D. Schindler M. Specht A. Landford W.N. Münch J. Kim K.-A. Votteler J. Schubert U. Bibollet-Ruche F. Keele B.F. et al.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). It remains to be clarified whether the HIV-1 Nef protein acquired antitetherin activity in SHIV-infected macaques and whether HIV-1 O strains may use another protein to antagonize tetherin. Nonetheless, these findings raise the possibility that effective tetherin antagonism may not be obligatory for efficient viral replication and disease progression in vivo. One possible reason for the presumably limited relevance of tetherin to HIV-1 pathogenesis and the development of AIDS is that tetherin and other host restriction factors may inhibit the cell-to-cell spread of virus (a potent means of virus replication in vivo) less efficiently than the spread of cell-free virions (Vendrame et al., 2009Vendrame D. Sourisseau M. Perrin V. Schwartz O. Mammano F. J. Virol. 2009; 83: 10527-10537Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Vpu-defective HIV-1 shows enhanced cell-to-cell transmission (Gummuluru et al., 2000Gummuluru S. Kinsey C.M. Emerman M. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 10882-10891Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and tetherin has been detected in biofilm-like extracellular viral assemblies that mediate cell-to-cell transmission of the lentivirus HTLV-1 (Pais-Correia et al., 2010Pais-Correia A.M. Sachse M. Guadagnini S. Robbiati V. Lasserre R. Gessain A. Gout O. Alcover A. Thoulouze M.I. Nat. Med. 2010; 16: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, HIV-1 mutants lacking Vpu replicate less effectively than wild-type virus in ex vivo-infected human lymphoid tissues (Schindler et al., 2010Schindler M. Rajan D. Banning C. Wimmer P. Koppensteiner H. Iwanski A. Specht A. Sauter D. Dobner T. Kirchhoff F. Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, further studies on the effect of tetherin on the cell-to-cell spread of viruses are warranted. The finding that only Vpu proteins of pandemic HIV-1 M strains are effective against both tetherin and CD4 suggests a role for these Vpu functions in sexual transmission of HIV-1 within the human population, possibly by affecting the shedding of infectious virions into genital fluids. Further studies comparing the rates of virus transmission and disease progression in infections caused by HIV-1 M and O (and as far as possible N and P) strains are needed to clarify the importance of tetherin antagonism and Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation in vivo. Increased expression of tetherin at the host cell surface can suppress the release and replication of wild-type HIV-1 strains in cell culture (Neil et al., 2007Neil S.J. Sandrin V. Sundquist W.I. Bieniasz P.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Sauter et al., 2009Sauter D. Schindler M. Specht A. Landford W.N. Münch J. Kim K.-A. Votteler J. Schubert U. Bibollet-Ruche F. Keele B.F. et al.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 6: 409-421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). IFN-α treatment and hence the induction of tetherin and other host restriction factors is known to reduce HIV-1 viremia in infected patients; however, these effects are often transient and accompanied by adverse reactions, such as flu-like symptoms and depression. A major problem is that IFN-α has both beneficial effects, because it inhibits virus replication, and harmful consequences, as it contributes to immune activation that helps to drive progression to AIDS (Herbeuval and Shearer, 2007Herbeuval J.P. Shearer G.M. Clin. Immunol. 2007; 123: 121-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Notably, differences in the induction of the type I IFN immune response may distinguish pathogenic and nonpathogenic primate lentiviral infections. During the acute phase of infection, a strong type I IFN response is activated by both pathogenic and nonpathogenic lentiviruses, but this response is rapidly controlled and returns to basal levels only in nonpathogenic virus infections (Bosinger et al., 2009Bosinger S.E. Li Q. Gordon S.N. Klatt N.R. Duan L. Xu L. Francella N. Sidahmed A. Smith A.J. Cramer E.M. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3556-3572PubMed Google Scholar, Jacquelin et al., 2009Jacquelin B. Mayau V. Targat B. Liovat A.S. Kunkel D. Petitjean G. Dillies M.A. Roques P. Butor C. Silvestri G. et al.J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 3544-3555PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, effective downmodulation of the type I IFN response may help the natural nonhuman primate hosts of SIVs to prevent the harmful chronic immune activation that drives progression to AIDS in HIV-1-infected individuals. Another study on gender differences in HIV-1 infection suggests that the favorable and adverse effects of IFN-α may compensate each other. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells derived from women produce more IFN-α in response to HIV-1 infection, and women tend to have lower viral loads than men (Meier et al., 2009Meier A. Chang J.J. Chan E.S. Pollard R.B. Sidhu H.K. Kulkarni S. Wen T.F. Lindsay R.J. Orellana L. Mildvan D. et al.Nat. Med. 2009; 15: 955-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). On average, women progress to AIDS about as fast as men do. At the same viral loads, however, women show higher levels of immune activation and faster disease progression. Thus, it is questionable whether long-term clinical benefits can be achieved with IFN-α treatment. It may be possible to induce tetherin expression in a more specific manner (i.e., without causing systemic inflammation) or only at specific sites. Another strategy is to develop specific inhibitors of the viral antagonists of tetherin. But even complete loss of Vpu does not entirely impair the ability of HIV-1 to replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures or in ex vivo-infected human lymphoid tissues (Neil et al., 2007Neil S.J. Sandrin V. Sundquist W.I. Bieniasz P.D. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 2: 193-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Schindler et al., 2010Schindler M. Rajan D. Banning C. Wimmer P. Koppensteiner H. Iwanski A. Specht A. Sauter D. Dobner T. Kirchhoff F. Retrovirology. 2010; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that this strategy may not be very efficient. Nonetheless, further studies that induce tetherin expression or block its viral antagonists are required, particularly as tetherin targets the plasma membrane of the host cell that becomes the viral envelope. Tetherin is effective against a large number of viral pathogens, and it will be difficult for HIV-1 and other viruses to develop resistance to this host restriction factor. We are only beginning to understand the complex interactions between viral pathogens and their hosts. For example, additional host restriction factors remain to be discovered, and the functions of many genes induced by IFN-α are only starting to be elucidated. One caveat is that most of the data about tetherin and the viral proteins that antagonize it has been obtained using transfected cells that are not usually susceptible to HIV or SIV infection. To elucidate the role of tetherin and its antagonists in viral release, replication, pathogenesis, and transmission, it will be important to study replication-competent viruses in primary cells, ex vivo explant tissues, and animal models. Such studies should also reveal whether Vpu is a more effective tetherin antagonist than Nef, which may help to clarify why HIV-1 evolved to cause greater chronic immune activation than natural SIV infections (Kirchhoff, 2009Kirchhoff F. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2009; 7: 467-476PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, such analyses are needed to accurately assess whether the induction of host restriction factors or inhibition of their viral antagonists represent useful therapeutic strategies. The discovery of tetherin and other host restriction factors may also lead to the development of improved animal models. Finally, the recent generation of an artificial tetherin (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009Perez-Caballero D. Zang T. Ebrahimi A. McNatt M.W. Gregory D.A. Johnson M.C. Bieniasz P.D. Cell. 2009; 139: 499-511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) suggests that it may be possible to develop improved restriction factors with broad-based antiviral activity that are resistant to the action of viral antagonists. Further research will not only provide exciting new insights into the struggle between viruses and their hosts but may also lead to new therapeutic interventions for treating HIV and other viral infections.

Found on the surface of many eukaryotic cells, cilia and flagella (redundant terms) are organelles consisting of membrane-bounded microtubular projections that emanate from basal body templates.

As isolated from the flagella of the green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, complex A contains at least six distinct proteins (IFT144, IFT140, IFT139, IFT122, IFT121, and IFT43), whereas complex B contains at least 13 proteins (IFT172, IFT88, IFT81, IFT80, IFT74/72, CrDYF-1, IFT57, IFT52, IFT46, IFT27, IFT25, IFT22, and IFT20); the subunit names reflect the relative mobilities of each when separated by SDS-PAGE and, thus, represent the approximate mass (kDa) of each protein (reviewed in Ref. 26Cole D.G. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: Cell Motility and Behavior Vol. 3. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2009: 71-113Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). As observed in other ciliated organisms, mutations affecting Chlamydomonas IFT B genes often result in severe disruptions of flagellar assembly. Mutations of either the IFT52 or IFT88 genes resulting in loss-of-function produce “bald” cells that are unable to construct flagella past the transition zone (27Brazelton W.J. Amundsen C.D.

A slightly less severe phenotype occurs in the ift46-1 mutant, where a fraction of the cells are able to assemble short (∼3-μm) paralyzed flagella (29Hou Y. Qin H. Follit J.A. Pazour G.J. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanism underlying the specific role of each IFT protein is largely unknown, mutant analysis has revealed important clues. IFT46, for example, is required for the assembly of outer dynein arms onto axonemal microtubules and also appears to be important in the stabilization of complex B (29Hou Y. Qin H. Follit J.A.

As isolated from Chlamydomonas flagella, complex B is much less stable than complex A (21Signor D. Wedaman K.P. Rose L.S. Scholey J.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 345-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation of IFT proteins under conditions of increasing ionic strength, for example, results in the partial dissociation of complex B, whereas A stays intact. This partial dissociation has revealed a stable subset of B proteins termed the B core that contains IFT88, IFT81, IFT74/72, IFT52, IFT46, IFT27, IFT25, and IFT22 (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H.

PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Within this core, IFT27 and IFT25 are thought to form a heterodimer (34Wang Z. Fan Z.C. Williamson S.M. Qin H. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e5384Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), whereas IFT81, IFT74, and IFT72 are thought to form a heterotetrameric complex in a ratio of 2:1:1, respectively, although the nature of the difference between the algal IFT74 and IFT72 remains unknown (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The only other published interaction between B subunits is that of the mammalian IFT20 with IFT57, as reported by Baker et al. (35Baker S.A. Freeman K. Luby-Phelps K. Pazour G.J. Besharse J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34211-34218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The studies presented here result from our efforts to identify additional interactions within the B complex. Initially, we employed an exhaustive yeast-based two-hybrid screen and found three interactions that included the previously reported IFT81 homodimerization and IFT81-IFT74/72 association (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As described here, we also found that IFT46 interacted directly with IFT52. Surprisingly, however, our screen was unable to identify additional interactions of B subunits. Hypothesizing that the assembly of the B complex is, at least partially, ordered, we exploited a heterologous coexpression system that facilitated tandem affinity purification of multiple proteins. After confirming the IFT46-IFT52 interaction, we found that IFT46 and IFT52 were also capable of interacting independently with IFT88; the IFT52-IFT88 interaction was further supported by separate cross-linking studies of the native complex B core. Coexpression of all three proteins followed by tandem affinity chromatography showed that they were able to form a ternary complex, suggesting that an in vivo association of these three subunits could occur in the absence of additional B proteins. Last, we show that, within hours of electroporation, recombinant IFT46 protein can rescue the Chlamydomonas ift46-2 flagellar assembly mutant phenotype. Furthermore, the N-terminal 25 amino acids of IFT46 were not essential to rescue the mutant phenotype. We conclude that the use of protein electroporation with Chlamydomonas IFT mutants could be used to dissect the function of additional IFT proteins as well as to provide a rapid means of introducing fluorescently tagged IFT protein into live cells. The Chlamydomonas cell wall-deficient strain CC-503 (cw92) was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Center. Chlamydomonas stains were grown on solid TAP medium (36Gorman D.S. Levine R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1965; 54: 1665-1669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1301) Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli strain Rosetta BL21 DE3 (Novagen) was used for all protein expression. All bacterial cloning was performed using the E. coli TOP10 (Invitrogen) strain. Liquid or solid Luria-Bertani (LB) media with appropriate antibiotic were used for all bacterial growth. Chlamydomonas motility mutants were generated by insertional mutagenesis of the cell wall-deficient strain, CC-503, using the pHyg3 plasmid carrying an aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph7″) gene that confers resistance to hygromycin B (37Pazour G.J. Witman G.B. Methods. 2000; 22: 285-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 38Sizova I. Fuhrmann M. Hegemann P. Gene. 2001; 277: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39Berthold P. Schmitt R. Mages W. Protist. 2002; 153: 401-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). In brief, CC-503 cells were spread liberally onto fresh TAP plates and placed under constant illumination (2300 lux average) 24–48 h prior to flooding with 14 ml of TAP medium for 1 h. Cells were resuspended in a total volume of ∼40 ml and shaken at 150 rpm for 1–2 h under constant light (1200 lux average); the density of cells at this stage was typically 1–2 × 107/ml. Cells were concentrated to ∼1.3 × 108/ml by centrifugation at 1200 × g for 2 min, followed by resuspension in TAP medium. Cell aliquots (330 μl; 0.5 × 108) were mixed with 10 μl of KpnI-digested pHyg3 plasmid (0.5 μg) and 112 μl 20% polyethylene glycol 8000 (Sigma) and vortexed on high for 15 s with 300 mg of sterile 0.5-mm glass beads (Propper Manufacturing Co.) according to Kindle (40Kindle K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 1228-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (819) Google Scholar). The cell mixture was immediately diluted with 10 ml of TAP medium, transferred to a 250-ml flask, further diluted to ∼20 ml with TAP medium, and allowed to recover for 4 h under light (1200 lux average) prior to plating on solid TAP medium (1.7% agar) containing 10 μg/ml hygromycin B. For plating, cells were concentrated, and ∼107 cells in 0.5 ml of TAP were quickly, albeit gently, mixed with 4.5 ml of TAP containing melted 0.45% agar (42 °C) with 10 μg/ml hygromycin B, before layering on top of solid TAP plates. After 10–12 days of constant illumination (2300 lux average), transformed colonies were visually screened for motility defects using a 96-well plate and an inverted phase microscope. Motility mutants displaying gross flagellar assembly defects were screened for disruptions in IFT genes using gene-specific PCR amplification with genomic DNA as the template; PCR primer sequences and amplification conditions are available upon request. After a strain was identified that failed to yield IFT46 PCR products, the genomic region containing the IFT46 gene was exhaustively screened using a variety of PCR primer sets to better define the disrupted region. The pMAL-c2x plasmid (New England BioLabs) was used for expression of all maltose-binding fusion proteins, whereas the pRSF-Duet plasmid (Novagen) was used for expression of His6-tagged and untagged proteins. Multicloning site 1 (MCS-1) of pRSF-Duet was used for all His6 fusions, and multicloning site 2 (MCS-2) was used for production of untagged, full-length IFT88. All IFT52 and IFT88 constructs used in this study were PCR-amplified and subcloned using a nearly full-length IFT52 cDNA clone (LCL098a07, accession number AV631675) and a full length IFT88 cDNA clone (LCL045a10, accession number AV628646); both clones were obtained from Kazusa DNA Research Institute (Kisarazu, Chiba, Japan) (41Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Sato S. Fukuzawa H. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 369-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42Asamizu E. Miura K. Kucho K. Inoue Y. Fukuzawa H. Ohyama K. Nakamura Y. Tabata S. DNA Res. 2000; 7: 305-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Attempts to clone a full-length IFT52 cDNA from total cDNA and cDNA libraries were unsuccessful. A full-length IFT46 cDNA clone was generated using a cDNA clone obtained as a generous gift from Hongmin Qin and Joel Rosenbaum. The IFT52 constructs used for coexpression experiments include 52ΔN24 (amino acids 25–454), 52ΔN90 (amino acids 90–454; minus the N terminus), 52ΔC122 (amino acids 25–332), 52M (amino acids 90–332; mid domain), and 52CT (amino acids 258–454; C-terminal 197 amino acids). 52ΔN24 was subcloned into the pMAL-c2x and pRSF-Duet vectors using the EcoRI and SalI restriction sites in MCS-1. 52ΔC122, 52ΔN90, 52M, and 52CT were cloned into the pMAL-c2x EcoRI and SalI sites of MCS-1. The full-length IFT88 cDNA encoding amino acids 1–782 as reported by Pazour et al. (28Pazour G.J. Dickert B.L. Vucica Y. Seeley E.S. Rosenbaum J.L. Witman G.B. Cole D.G. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 709-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pRSF-Duet NdeI and BglII sites within MCS-2. IFT46 constructs used for coexpression experiments include 46F (amino acids 1–344; full length), 46ΔN100 (amino acids 101–344; minus the N terminus), 46ΔC89 (amino acids 1–255; minus the C terminus), 46M (amino acids 101–255; mid domain), and 46CT (amino acids 198–344; C-terminal 147 amino acids). The full coding sequence of IFT46 (46F) was subcloned into pMAL-c2x and pRSF-Duet using the EcoRI and SalI sites of MCS-1. DNA encoding 46ΔN100, 46ΔC89, 46M, and 46CT were cloned into pRSF-Duet using the EcoRI and SalI sites of MCS-1. Primer sequences for all amplifications are available upon request. Yeast-based two-hybrid analysis was performed as described by Lucker et al. (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) using the Hybrizap 2.1 two-hybrid system based on the GAL4 transcriptional activator and YRG-2 host cells (Stratagene). IFT46, IFT52, and IFT88 GAL4 activation domain (AD) or DNA binding domain (BD) constructs were generated using the same cDNA sources utilized and described for the bacterial coexpression. Negative control plasmids expressed only the activation domain (AD-MCS) or DNA binding domain (BD-MCS). As supplied by the manufacturer, the two-hybrid strong interaction control consisted of amino acids 132–236 of wild-type λ cI, fragment C, fused to both the AD and BD domains (Stratagene). The weak interaction control consisted of a mutant form of the λ cI protein fused to both the AD and BD domains. The negative interaction control combined the AD-λ cI vector with the human lamin C (amino acids 67–230) in the BD vector. Protein electroporation was performed as described by Hayashi et al. (43Hayashi M. Yanagisawa H.A. Hirono M. Kamiya R. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2002; 53: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, Chlamydomonas CC-503 cells were grown on solid TAP medium (1.7% agar) for 3–5 days and then suspended in liquid TAP+S (TAP medium containing 60 mm sucrose). Suspended cells were placed below a 60-watt incandescent plant grow light (1000–1400 lux) for 1–2 h and agitated by shaking. Cells were gently pelleted in a microcentrifuge at 250 × g for 2 min and washed three times with HMDKCaS buffer (30 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm calcium acetate, 60 mm sucrose, pH 7.4). After the third wash, cells were brought to a density of 108 cells/ml in HMDKCaS and incubated at 15 °C for 15 min. Cells were then mixed with recombinant protein in a 1:1 ratio with a final volume and protein concentration of 125 μl and 0.5 mg/ml, respectively, in a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette (BTX, Harvard Bioscience). The cuvette was placed at a ∼135° angle for 1 min immediately prior to electroporation. Electroporation was performed using an ECM630 electroporator (BTX) set at a voltage of 1.6 kV/cm, with a resistance of 25 ohms and conductance of 500 microfarads. Immediately following electroporation, cells were diluted into 300 μl of TAP+S and gently agitated every few min by hand at room temperature (∼23–25 °C) for 1 h. Prior to fluorescent imaging, excess labeled protein was removed from the medium by gently washing cells three times in 1.5 ml of TAP+S medium with 2 min of centrifugation at 250 × g; cells were resuspended in a final volume of 300 μl in TAP+S. For protein coexpression, 100 ml of LB liquid medium containing both ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (30 μg/ml) was inoculated with overnight cultures of E. coli BL21 DE3 Rosetta cells (Novagen) containing both pMAL-c2x (New England BioLabs) and pRSF-Duet (Novagen) expression vectors. Shaken at 37 °C until the A600 was ∼0.6, cells were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for a period of 2 h before harvest. Harvested cells were cooled on ice while protease inhibitors (0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.4 μg/ml aprotinin, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.2 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor) were added. Cells were immediately centrifuged for 10 min at 3500 × g at 4 °C and then resuspended in 10 ml of amylose chromatography buffer (ACB; 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, and 1.0 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) prior to storage at −28 °C. For preparation of soluble lysates, cells were thawed to 4 °C while 1.0 mm dithiothreitol and the same protease inhibitors described above were added. Cells were lysed via eight 15-s sonication pulses with 30-s breaks on ice between pulses. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 17,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Soluble cell lysate was diluted to a final volume of 50 ml with ACB and loaded onto a 2-ml amylose resin column equilibrated in ACB. After washing with 20 bed volumes of ACB, protein was eluted with 3 ml of ACB supplemented with 10 mm maltose and collected in 8–10 fractions (∼300 μl/fraction). For consistency in comparative analyses, 5-μl samples were fractionated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels (44Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar). For Western blots, proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with primary antibodies prior to incubation with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies and colorimetric development as described by Harlow and Lane (45Harlow E. Lane D. Using Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999: 276-304Google Scholar). His6-tagged proteins were purified using nickel ion affinity chromatography following standard protocols, including imidazole elution, as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). Recombinant IFT46 (His6-46F) and a control protein, BSA (Fraction V, Fisher), were fluorescently labeled with Alexa-fluor 488-activated succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen) following the recommended procedures. Briefly, bacterially expressed His6-46F was purified on a Ni2+ column following protocols recommended by Novagen. Purified His6-46F was concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml using an Amicon Ultra centrifugal concentration column with a 5000 Da limit (Millipore) and exchanged into conjugation buffer (0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, pH 8.3) using a 5-ml Sephadex G-25 (GE Healthcare) centrifugation column as described by Penefsky (46Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2891-2899Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After the reactive Alexa-fluor ester was solubilized in DMSO at a final concentration of 10 mg/ml, 50 μl was added slowly to 500 μl of His6-46F or BSA at ∼10 mg/ml with continuous agitation using a micro-stir bar for 1 h at room temperature. Free dye was removed, and labeled protein was exchanged into electroporation buffer using a 5-ml Sephadex G-25 centrifugation column. The ratio of fluorophore to protein following gel filtration was calculated to be ∼1.5 and ∼1.2 for His6-46F and BSA, respectively. Fluorescent protein was visualized within the ift46-2 mutant using an LSM 510 META confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Inc.). Chemical cross-linking and isolation of cross-linked products were performed as described previously (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In brief, soluble flagellar proteins were fractionated by high salt (300 mm NaCl in HMDEK buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm KCI) sucrose density gradient centrifugation. The IFT complex B core fractions were pooled, divided into equal aliquots, and treated with 1,5-diflouro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (DFDNB; Pierce) at final concentrations of 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, and 3.0 mm for 10 min on ice before being quenched with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5. The complex B core was then selectively immunoprecipitated from each aliquot with ∼25 μl of an anti-IFT81 antibody resin (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The resin was batch-washed three times in a 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube using 15 bed volumes of HMEK-300 prior to a 95 °C 3-min incubation and elution with ∼25 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were separated on 4.0% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and visualized with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands containing cross-linked products were excised from the gels, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Resulting peptide masses were compared with predicted tryptic IFT particle protein peptides using Protein Prospector (47Clauser K.R. Baker P. Burlingame A.L. Anal. Chem. 1999; 71: 2871-2882Crossref PubMed Scopus (978) Google Scholar). The protein subunits of the Chlamydomonas intraflagellar transport complex B are encoded by at least 13 distinct genes, known as IFT172, IFT88, IFT81, IFT80, IFT74/72, CrDYF-1, IFT57, IFT52, IFT46, IFT27, IFT25, IFT22, and IFT20 (reviewed in Ref. 26Cole D.G. The Chlamydomonas Sourcebook: Cell Motility and Behavior Vol. 3. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA2009: 71-113Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In an attempt to identify which of the B subunits interact with one another, we tested every pairwise combination of B proteins, with the exception of CrDYF-1, using an exhaustive yeast-based two-hybrid screen. A direct interaction between IFT81 and IFT74/72 and a homodimeric interaction between two IFT81 proteins were described previously (33Lucker B.F. Behal R.H. Qin H. Siron L.C. Taggart W.D. Rosenbaum J.L. Cole D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 27688-27696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In the extensive two-hybrid screen described here, the only additional interaction identified was between IFT52 and IFT46 (Fig. 1). In this assay, the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain was fused to the amino terminus of full-length IFT46 (AD-46F), whereas the GAL4 DNA binding domain was fused to the N-terminal end of a nearly full-length IFT52 (amino acids 25–454; BD-52ΔN24); cloning issues prevented use of a full-length IFT52 fusion protein. The combination of these two plasmids allowed yeast colonies to grow on selective medium missing histidine and adenine (−His, −Ade). The reciprocal experiment where the IFT46 and IFT52 fusion proteins are switched was not possible due to false positive results with the BD-46F construct (data not shown). As a verification of"
https://openalex.org/W2076086192,"Our recent work identified store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) as the critical Ca2+ source required for the induction of human myoblast differentiation (Darbellay, B., Arnaudeau, S., König, S., Jousset, H., Bader, C., Demaurex, N., and Bernheim, L. (2009) J. Biol. Chem. 284, 5370–5380). The present work indicates that STIM2 silencing, similar to STIM1 silencing, reduces myoblast SOCE amplitude and differentiation. Because myoblasts in culture can be induced to differentiate into myotubes, which spontaneously contract in culture, we used the same molecular tools to explore whether the Ca2+ mechanism of excitation-contraction coupling also relies on STIM1 and STIM2. Live cell imaging of early differentiating myoblasts revealed a characteristic clustering of activated STIM1 and STIM2 during the first few hours of differentiation. Thapsigargin-induced depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content caused STIM1 and STIM2 redistribution into clusters, and co-localization of both STIM proteins. Interaction of STIM1 and STIM2 was revealed by a rapid increase in fluorescence resonance energy transfer between CFP-STIM1 and YFP-STIM2 after SOCE activation and confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous STIM1 and STIM2. Although both STIM proteins clearly contribute to SOCE and are required during the differentiation process, STIM1 and STIM2 are functionally largely redundant as overexpression of either STIM1 or STIM2 corrected most of the impact of STIM2 or STIM1 silencing on SOCE and differentiation. With respect to excitation-contraction, we observed that human myotubes rely also on STIM1 and STIM2 to refill their endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-content during repeated KCl-induced Ca2+ releases.

https://openalex.org/W2030968105,"The serine protease granzyme B (GrB) is the most potent proapoptotic cytotoxin of the granule exocytosis pathway of cytotoxic lymphocytes. GrB is synthesized as a zymogen (proGrB) and activated in cytotoxic granules by the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin C (CatC) which removes the N-terminal dipeptide Gly-Glu. It has been shown recently that mice lacking CatC nonetheless express significant residual GrB activity, indicating the presence of additional proGrB convertases. Here, we describe an assay to assess activation of proGrB and show that the amino-peptidase cathepsin H (CatH) has proGrB convertase activity in vitro, whereas dipeptidylpeptidase II does not. We generated mice lacking both CatC and CatH expression (CatCH−/−) and found that their lymphocytes have reduced convertase activity compared with those from CatC-deficient mice. Despite this, cytotoxic lymphocytes from CatCH−/− mice retain cytotoxic activity and some residual GrB activity. We conclude that CatH can act as an additional proGrB convertase and that other protease/s (apart from dipeptidylpeptidase II) must also possess convertase activity. This indicates a great deal of functional redundancy in GrB maturation, which would prevent pathogen-mediated immune suppression by via convertase inhibition.

CLs induce cell death through two distinct pathways, by signaling through death receptors or activating the granule exocytosis pathway. In the latter, specialized secretory lysosomes (“granules”) release their contents into the synapse formed between the killer and the target cell (1Burkhardt J.K. Hester S. Lapham C.K. Argon Y. J.

These deadly contents include perforin, a pore-forming protein capable of lysing cells at high concentration and granzymes, a family of serine proteases.

GrB is a potent cytotoxin that induces apoptosis in vitro when applied to cells at nanomolar concentrations with purified perforin (3Kaiserman D. Bird C.H. Sun J. Matthews A. Ung K. Whisstock J.C. Thompson P.E. Trapani J.A. Bird P.I. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 175: 619-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Perforin is critical for granzyme-mediated cell death, as it facilitates entry of proteases into the target cell cytosol, where they can access and cleave substrates to bring about target cell death (4Shi L.

GrB is synthesized and activated through a mechanism common to other serine proteases that reside in lysosomes (5Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Following entry into the secretory pathway, its signal peptide is removed in the endoplasmic reticulum, leaving GrB as a zymogen (proGrB), with an inhibitory dipeptide at the newly formed N terminus (6Caputo A. Garner R.S. Winkler U. Hudig D. Bleackley R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17672-17675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Lobe C.G. Finlay B.B. Paranchych W. Paetkau V.H. Bleackley R.C. Science. 1986; 232: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Upon reaching the Golgi, proGrB follows the mannose-6-phosphate pathway into the secretory lysosomes, where its processing is completed by the cysteine amino-dipeptidase cathepsin C (CatC) (8Griffiths G.M. Isaaz S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 885-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 9Smyth M.J. McGuire M.J. Thia K.Y. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 6299-6305PubMed Google Scholar). Although CatC is certainly sufficient to activate proGrB, its necessity has been questioned by two lines of evidence. First, activated lymphocytes derived from humans with congenital deficiency of CatC (Papillon-Lefevre syndrome) contain active GrB and kill target cells with similar efficiency to healthy controls (10Pham C.T. Ivanovich J.L. Raptis S.Z. Zehnbauer B. Ley T.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7277-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Papillon-Lefevre syndrome patients present principally with manifestations of neutrophil dysfunction, such as severe gingivitis, because the neutrophil serine proteases cathepsin G and elastase depend completely on CatC for processing (10Pham C.T. Ivanovich J.L. Raptis S.Z. Zehnbauer B. Ley T.J. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 7277-7281Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11de Haar S.F. Jansen D.C. Schoenmaker T. De Vree H. Everts V. Beertsen W. Hum. Mutat. 2004; 23: 524Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Secondly, lymphocytes from CatC−/− mice possess active GrB and kill target cells almost as efficiently as wild-type mice (12Sutton V.R. Waterhouse N.J. Browne K.A. Sedelies K. Ciccone A. Anthony D. Koskinen A. Mullbacher A. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This evidence led us to postulate that additional proteases must be capable of activating proGrB. We therefore developed an assay for GrB convertase activity and tested the candidate aminopeptidases dipeptidylpeptidase II (DPPII) and cathepsin H (CatH). We found that CatH, but not DPPII, has GrB convertase activity; however, lymphocytes deficient in both CatC and CatH are still capable of generating active GrB, indicating that additional GrB convertases exist in intact CLs. All reagents were obtained from either Merck or Sigma unless otherwise specified. Bovine CatC was purchased from Sigma (catalog no. 9032-68-2). Human CatH was purchased from Merck (catalog no. 60748-73-4). Human DPPII was purchased from Biomol (catalog no. SE564-0010). To obtain accurate specific activities, CatC and CatH were titrated with the irreversible active site inhibitors Ala-4-(I)Phe-DMK (a gift from Merck Frosst Canada (13Méthot N. Rubin J. Guay D.

The residual activity was assessed on the substrate Gly-Phe-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (CatC) or l-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (CatH), purchased from MP Biomedicals and Sigma, respectively. Recombinant human ProGrB was produced in Pichia pastoris and purified from culture supernatant as described previously for GrB (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), except that the construct was designed to include the natural two-residue prodomain (Gly-Glu) downstream of the enterokinase (EK) cleavage site. Removal of the His tag by EK was verified by submitting 2 μg of proGrB for amino acid sequencing via Edman degradation (Monash Proteomics Facility) as described previously (15Sun J. Whisstock J.C.

The reaction mix was then added to 90 μl of buffer containing 200 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to optimize the pH for GrB activity. GrB activity was subsequently assayed using the quenched fluorescence substrate, aminobenzoyl-IEPDSSMESK- dinitrophenyl as described previously, which is specific for human granzyme B (15Sun J.

Allostimulated splenocytes were washed in saline and then lysed at 4 × 107 cells/ml in buffer containing 0.1% IGEPAL, 250 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm EDTA, and 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. 10 μl of lysate was incubated overnight with 10 μl of buffer containing 20 pmol of proGrB, 50 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 5.5. This reaction was then assayed for GrB activity as above. C57BL/6 (H-2b) and BALB/c (H-2d) mice were purchased from the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. The GrA and GrB cluster-deficient mice (17Simon M.M. Hausmann M. Tran T. Ebnet K. Tschopp J. ThaHla R. Müllbacher A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Markus Simon (Max-Planck-Institut fur Immunbiologie, Freiburg, Germany) and bred and maintained at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute. As the GrB cluster-deficient mice were generated using 129 embryonic stem cells, the double knock-out mice were backcrossed for eight generations onto a C57BL/6 background. A PCR-screening protocol (17Simon M.M. Hausmann M. Tran T. Ebnet K. Tschopp J. ThaHla R. Müllbacher A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) was used for genotyping. Christine Pham (Washington University School of Medicine, St.Louis, MO) kindly provided the CatC−/− (designated previously as DPP1) mice (18Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), which had been backcrossed onto the C57BL/6 background for 11 generations. A PCR protocol provided by C. Pham was used to verify the disruption of the wild-type CatC gene. CatH−/− mice were generated by replacing exon 5 through intron 9 of the CatH gene with a targeting construct comprising internal ribosome entry site, a lacZ reporter, and a G418 resistance cassette (neor) using homologous recombination in HM1-mouse embryonic stem cells. CatH-deficient mice do not show a gross morphological phenotype and no impairment of reproductive capacity or breeding behavior or nursing. A full account of generation and phenotyping of CatH−/− mice will be published elsewhere. 7C. Peters and T. Reinheckel, manuscript in preparation. The CatC/CatH double knock-out mice were bred to homozygosity at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Institute and used at 6–8 weeks of age. The development, fertility (litter size and sex), and life span of the CatC/H−/− mice were normal. Examination of the major organs, including the lymphoid organs, was normal. Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed to verify that the splenic subpopulations were unaltered (data not shown). Approval for all mouse experiments was through the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre animal ethics committee. The mouse mastocytoma cell line P815 (H-2d), was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with high glucose (4.5 g/liter, JRH Biosciences) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (JRH Biosciences), 2 mm glutamine (Invitrogen), 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Allogeneic (H-2b anti H-2d) mouse cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) were generated by one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) as described previously (12Sutton V.R. Waterhouse N.J. Browne K.A. Sedelies K. Ciccone A. Anthony D. Koskinen A. Mullbacher A. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and maintained in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented as above, with the addition of 100 μm nonessential amino acids, 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen), and 50 international units/ml recombinant interleukin-2. For most assays, CTLs were used after 7 days, but for some assays, CTL, which had been restimulated for a further 3 days, were used. The effector cells generated from each strain were >80% CD8+ T cells and displayed equivalent levels of activation markers (CD25, CD69). Western blot analysis demonstrated similar levels of perforin and GrB protein in each of the effector cell populations (data not shown). Standard 51Cr and 125I-DNA release assays (19Sutton V.R. Vaux D.L. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5783-5790PubMed Google Scholar) were used to compare the membrane damage and the DNA fragmentation induced in P815 target cells by the CTL. GrA (tryptase) and GrB (aspase) esterolytic activity presence in whole cell lysates of primary and secondarily stimulated CTLs were measured as described previously (20Davis J.E. Sutton V.R. Browne K.A. Trapani J.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2003; 276: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) by the hydrolysis of synthetic peptide thiobenzylester substrates: Boc-Ala-Ala-Asp-thiobenzyl (kindly provided by Dr Jim Powers, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia) for GrB and Boc-l-lysine-S-benzyl (Sigma) for GrA. Potential candidates for proGrB activation would almost certainly need to be present in lysosomes and have amino-peptidase activity. Other than CatC, two proteases that fit these criteria are DPPII and CatH. DPPII is a serine dipeptidase with a strong preference for Pro at the P1 residue, making it unlikely to activate proGrB, as the dipeptide typically cleaved from proGrB is Gly-Glu (21Leiting B. Pryor K.D. Wu J.K. Marsilio F. Patel R.A. Craik C.S. Ellman J.A. Cummings R.T. Thornberry N.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 371: 525-532Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Maes M.B. Lambeir A.M. Gilany K. Senten K. Van der Veken P. Leiting B. Augustyns K. Scharpé S. De Meester I. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). CatH is the only other known cathepsin with aminopeptidase activity and, as a monopeptidase, would have to sequentially remove the two amino acids of the proGrB pro-dipeptide. Further processing would be precluded, as the exposed N-terminal Ile then forms a salt bridge with the Asp in the active site of the protease, resulting in a rapid conformational change (5Salvesen G. Enghild J.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5304-5308Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). To test candidate proteases for proGrB convertase activity, we produced recombinant proGrB in Pichia pastoris in a manner similar to that described previously for GrB (14Sun J. Bird C.H. Buzza M.S. McKee K.E. Whisstock J.C. Bird P.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 251-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The precursor protein comprises an α-factor polypeptide (removed by Kex2p during biosynthesis), a His6 tag, and EK cleavage site, followed by the native prodomain of human GrB (Gly-Glu) and the mature GrB sequence (Fig. 1A). The Kex2p-processed precursor protein was purified by cation-exchange and nickel affinity chromatography and treated with EK to remove the additional N-terminal domains, leaving only proGrB. As shown in Fig. 1B, treatment of the precursor protein with EK slightly reduced its size, consistent with removal of the His tag and EK site. (The panel shows an incomplete EK digestion to illustrate this). A sample of completely digested proGrB was N-terminally sequenced, confirming that processing by EK was complete and correct (Fig. 1C). A convertase assay for proGrB activation incorporated an initial activation step at pH 5.5 to mimic the lysosomal conditions required for CatC, followed by adjustment of the pH to 7.4 for optimal GrB activity. Under these conditions, CatC was able to activate proGrB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Overnight (16 h) treatment of proGrB with CatC showed that the GrB generated remained active and stable under prolonged incubation (Fig. 2B). CatH and DPPII were tested for their ability to activate proGrB. As predicted, DPPII did not produce any increase in GrB activity over untreated proGrB despite prolonged incubation and a favorable stoichiometric ratio (Fig. 3B). By contrast, CatH produced a dose-dependent activation of proGrB (Fig. 3A). Overnight treatment of proGrB with CatH produced ∼50% of the GrB activity produced by CatC (Fig. 3B). CatC, CatH, and DPPII did not hydrolyze the GrB substrate in the absence of proGrB (data not shown). To the best of our knowledge, these experiments are the first demonstrating a role for CatH in activating any protease, and the first demonstration of a proGrB convertase other than CatC. To demonstrate that CatH activates proGrB by removing the same two residues as CatC, a sample of CatH-treated proGrB was N-terminally sequenced. This showed that the new N terminus is the same as that observed for CatC-treated proGrB, Ile-Ile-Gly-Gly (data not shown). CatH likely achieves this by sequentially removing the two residues of the pro-dipeptide. To investigate the involvement of CatH in activation of proGrB in vivo, CatC−/− mice were bred with CatH−/− mice to produce mice deficient in both proteases (CatCH−/−). Lysates were made from the spleens of wild-type BL/6, CatC−/−, CatH−/−, and CatCH−/− mice and tested for proGrB convertase activity. As the substrate aminobenzoyl-IEPDSSMESK-dinitrophenyl is specific for human GrB, it was possible to use mouse cell lysates as a source of activating proteases in the convertase assay without endogenous mouse GrB confounding the assay (Fig. 4, A and B). As expected, wild-type and CatH−/− cell lysates both produced a high level of substrate turnover from activation of proGrB, as they both contain CatC (Fig. 4A). Also, as expected from previous studies, CatC−/− cell lysate exhibited some convertase activity. By contrast, there was significantly less convertase activity in CatCH−/− lysates (Fig. 4B), strongly supporting a role for CatH in proGrB activation in vivo. Lysates produced from activated lymphocytes derived from the different mouse lines were also used in the proGrB convertase assay. Again, wild-type and CatH−/− lysates generated the greatest amount of GrB activity; however, in this case, CatC−/− and CatCH −/− cells produced equivalent convertase activity (Fig. 4C). This suggests that additional activating protease(s) are up-regulated in these cells on stimulation and that CatH is not important for activating proGrB in this context. To test the functional consequences on cytotoxic activity of losing both CatC and CatH, in vitro one-way MLRs were used to generate alloreactive (H-2b anti-H-2d) CTLs. Cells from primary 7-day MLRs were compared for their capacity to induce 51Cr release assay (a marker of plasma membrane disruption) and 125I-DNA release (a measure of DNA fragmentation) at varying effector to target ratios (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively). As reported previously, CatC−/− CTLs induced similar 51Cr release from P815 target cells as BL/6 CTLs. Consistent with a reduction in the levels of active GrB produced by these cells, 125I-DNA release was reduced compared with wild-type BL/6 but remained markedly higher than in CTLs generated from mice, in which both the GrA and GrB genes were disrupted. These observations are consistent with the observed phenotype of GrB−/− mice, which demonstrate reduced target cell DNA fragmentation in short term assays (23Heusel J.W. Wesselschmidt R.L. Shresta S. Russell J.H. Ley T.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 977-987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar). At all but the lowest effector to target ratio used, the CatCH −/− CTLs produced levels of 51Cr and 125I-DNA release similar to those of CatC−/− CTLs. To determine whether the cytotoxic activity of CatCH−/− CTLs could be explained by residual GrB activity, lysates of CTLs generated in the MLR were tested for aspase activity. This confirmed that CatCH−/− CTL contained GrB activity equivalent to that seen in CatC−/− CTLs (Fig. 5C). An assay for BLTase (“tryptase”) activity showed that, like the CatC−/− CTLs, CatCH −/− CTLs do not contain active GrA (Fig. 5D). This confirmed that the activation of proGrA is totally dependent on CatC (12Sutton V.R. Waterhouse N.J. Browne K.A. Sedelies K. Ciccone A. Anthony D. Koskinen A. Mullbacher A. Trapani J.A. J. Cell Biol. 2007; 176: 425-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Taken together, our results show that whereas both CatC and CatH have proGrB convertase activity, at least one additional protease must be capable of processing the GrB pro-form in their absence. We show here that there are multiple pathways to granzyme B activation, which include cathepsin H. Granzymes and perforin play crucial roles in protecting mammals against viruses and other intracellular pathogens, as demonstrated by the increased susceptibility of perforin- or granzyme-deficient mice and perforin-deficient humans to overwhelming virus infection. For example, perforin-deficient mice are exquisitely sensitive to the mousepox virus ectromelia, due to their inability to mount an effective CTL response (17Simon M.M. Hausmann M. Tran T. Ebnet K. Tschopp J. ThaHla R. Müllbacher A. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1781-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). GrAB−/− mice are also highly sensitive to ectromelia, although these mice are able to generate functional anti-ectromelia CTLs (18Pham C.T. Ley T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 8627-8632Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). The defect in the defense of GrAB−/− mice against ectromelia therefore remains unclear. In other infections, granzymes interfere directly in viral replication and apoptosis of the infected cell. This is perhaps best exemplified by recent studies in human adenovirus V infection, in which GrB and granzyme H (GrH) were shown to cooperatively limit viral replication and assembly and to hasten the death of infected cells. The capsid protein L4–100K produced in infected cells acts as a competitive inhibitor of GrB. However, GrH efficiently cleaves L4–100K to relieve the block on GrB-mediated apoptosis (24Andrade F. Fellows E. Jenne D.E. Rosen A. Young C.S. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2148-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In addition, GrH cleaves proteins pivotal in viral DNA synthesis such as DNA-binding protein, thereby limiting viral replication. Recently it has also been demonstrated that GrB has extracellular matrix remodelling ability, suggesting that it may contribute to lymphocyte migration or hemostasis during inflammation (25Buzza M.S. Dyson J.M. Choi H. Gardiner E.E. Andrews R.K. Kaiserman D. Mitchell C.A. Berndt M.C. Dong J.F. Bird P.I. J. Biol.

Together, these graphic demonstrations of the importance of GrB in immune function provide a clear evolutionary rationale for redundancy in the mechanisms that underpin GrB activation.

https://openalex.org/W2038437593,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family members, especially interferon regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1) and interferon regulatory factor-8 (IRF-8 or ICSBP), play important roles in interferon signaling in a wide range of host responses to infection and tumor growth. Interleukin-27 (IL-27), as a member of the IL-12 cytokine family, not only acts as a proinflammatory cytokine that regulates the differentiation of naive T helper cells but also possesses anti-inflammatory properties. IL-27 consists of EBI3 (Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3) and p28 subunits. Our previous work has shown that IRF-1 regulates IL-27 p28 gene transcription by specifically binding to the IRF-1 response element in the p28 promoter. In this study, we found that IRF-8-deficient macrophages were highly defective in the production of IL-27 p28 at both mRNA and protein levels. Circulating IL-27 p28 in serum was also decreased in IRF-8(-/-) mice in a septic shock model. Lipopolysaccharide, as a potent inducer of IL-27 p28 expression, could activate IRF-8 expression in a MyD88-dependent pathway, which in turn induced p28 gene transcription through NF-kappaB and/or IRF-8. Transcriptional analyses revealed that IRF-8 activated p28 gene transcription through binding to a site located at -57 to -48 in the p28 promoter overlapping the IRF-1 binding site. Consistent with this observation, overexpression of both IRF-8 and IRF-1 additively activated IL-27 p28 promoter. This study provides further mechanistic information regarding how signals initiated during innate and adaptive immune responses synergize to yield greater IL-27 production and sustained cellular immunity."
https://openalex.org/W2002246101,"Current views of sensory adaptation in the rat somatosensory system suggest that it results mainly from short-term synaptic depression. Experimental and theoretical studies predict that increasing the intensity of sensory stimulation, followed by an increase in firing probability at early sensory stages, is expected to attenuate the response at later stages disproportionately more than weaker stimuli, due to greater depletion of synaptic resources and the relatively slow recovery process. This may lead to coding ambiguity of stimulus intensity during adaptation. In contrast, we found that increasing the intensity of repetitive whisker stimulation entails less adaptation in cortical neurons. In a series of recordings, from the trigeminal ganglion to the thalamus, we pinpointed the source of the unexpected pattern of adaptation to the brainstem trigeminal complex.

The functional role of this adaptation process is not clear, but it has been hypothesized to serve several different roles (Wark et al., 2007Wark B. Lundstrom B.N. Fairhall A.

In the rat somatosensory system, stimuli delivered to the facial vibrissae are conveyed to layer 4 of the primary somatosensory cortex via three synapses (Petersen, 2003Petersen C.C. The barrel cortex—integrating molecular, cellular and systems physiology.Pflugers Arch. 2003; 447: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and through at least four parallel pathways (Urbain and Deschênes, 2007Urbain N.

The lemniscal pathway, which provides powerful short latency input to the primary somatosensory cortex, originates in afferent fibers that innervate whisker follicles and synapse onto neurons in the principalis nucleus of the brainstem trigeminal complex (PrV). These PrV neurons send axons to the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus (VPM), which in turn delivers sensory input to layer 4 cortical cells. Several studies suggested a major role for synaptic depression in layer 4 adaptation (Chung et al., 2002Chung S. Li X. Nelson S.B.

Less is known about adaptation at earlier stages of the somatosensory system, although studies of VPM also suggest a role for synaptic depression in thalamic adaptation (Castro-Alamancos, 2002bCastro-Alamancos M.A. Properties of primary sensory (lemniscal) synapses in the ventrobasal thalamus and the relay of high-frequency sensory inputs.J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 946-953PubMed Google Scholar, Deschênes et al., 2003Deschênes M. Timofeeva E. Lavallée P. The relay of high-frequency sensory signals in the Whisker-to-barreloid pathway.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6778-6787PubMed Google Scholar). Studies of short-term synaptic depression led to highly successful mathematical descriptions of this phenomenon (Tsodyks and Markram, 1997Tsodyks M.V. Markram H. The neural code between neocortical pyramidal neurons depends on neurotransmitter release probability.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). Assuming adaptation in the lemniscal pathway results mostly from synaptic depression gives rise to several interesting predictions. First, these models predict that an increase in stimulus intensity, which is followed by higher firing probability at early sensory stages, will raise the effective frequency of stimulation, resulting in greater depression during repetitive stimulation due to depletion of synaptic resources and the relatively slow recovery processes (see Figure 1A and Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). In addition, during adaptation, responses to low-intensity stimuli may actually surpass those to higher-intensity stimuli. This may prevent the decoding of stimulus intensity from response magnitude, leading to coding ambiguity during adaptation (Figure 1B). We tested these hypotheses in vivo, in cortical, thalamic, brainstem, and first-order sensory stages and found that our results do not agree with the predictions of short-term synaptic depression models, suggesting that other mechanisms act to counterbalance the effects of synaptic depression in early sensory processing. Models of short-term synaptic depression predict that increasing stimulation intensity will result in greater response adaptation, which may lead to ambiguity in the coding of stimulus intensity during adaptation (Figures 1A and 1B; see Introduction for more details). We tested this hypothesis in the rat barrel cortex, whose inputs are thought to adapt mainly due to short-term synaptic depression. To that end, we applied repetitive whisker stimulation at frequencies within the natural whisking range when performing object discrimination tasks (Berg and Kleinfeld, 2003Berg R.W. Kleinfeld D. Rhythmic whisking by rat: retraction as well as protraction of the vibrissae is under active muscular control.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 89: 104-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar) (18 Hz, 20 stimuli). Stimuli were delivered at two very different intensities while recording intracellularly from cortical cells located within or having dendritic innervations in layer 4 and presumably receive direct thalamic input (n = 7; see Figures 1C and 1D for example neuron). The high-intensity stimulation was set to the maximal deflection of the stimulator, and the weak stimulation was selected online such that it evoked a significantly smaller response. The exact amplitude and velocity of the weak stimulation was different across the population, since a sharp drop in response probability was observed at very different stimulation intensities. This could be due to the fact that different whiskers were used in this study and the different angular tuning properties of the recorded neurons (Andermann and Moore, 2006Andermann M.L. Moore C.I. A somatotopic map of vibrissa motion direction within a barrel column.Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 543-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, Kerr et al., 2007Kerr J.N. de Kock C.P.

Neurosci. 2007; 27: 13316-13328Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Across all recordings, we verified that the response probability evoked by the first stimulus for the weak stimulation was at least 10% smaller than for the strong stimulus. Adaptation of cortical cells was quantified by the peak average subthreshold response for each stimulus divided by the peak of the first response, providing a peak response adaptation ratio (Figure 1F). We also calculated the F1 index (responsiveness index; see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), which measures the ratio of the power at the stimulation frequency of the recorded response and that of an ideal nonadapted response (<1 corresponding to adaptation, >1 corresponding to facilitation; Figure 1F, inset). In contrast to the short-term synaptic depression model, we found that not only does the voltage response to high-intensity stimulus not adapt more than in the low-intensity condition, it actually adapts slightly less than the response to weaker stimulation (Figures 1E and 1F). In six out of seven cells, the F1 index of the response to high-intensity stimulus was higher than that to low-intensity stimulus (p < 0.02, one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Importantly, at these stimulation conditions, we observe no intersection of the response curves, as may occur theoretically (Figure 1B), avoiding possible coding ambiguity and allowing for stimulus intensity to be decoded from response magnitude even during adaptation. However, the amplitude of the voltage response can be affected by inhibition (Heiss et al., 2008Heiss J.E. Katz Y. Ganmor E. Lampl I. Shift in the balance between excitation and inhibition during sensory adaptation of S1 neurons.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 13320-13330Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, Moore and Nelson, 1998Moore C.I. Nelson S.B. Spatio-temporal subthreshold receptive fields in the vibrissa representation of rat primary somatosensory cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 1998; 80: 2882-2892PubMed Google Scholar), which may mask the actual adaptation of the excitatory input to the cell. To overcome this, we used conductance estimates (see Experimental Procedures). When considering only the estimated excitatory inputs to these cells, we found similar results (Figures 1G and 1H), suggesting that the excitatory input to cortical cells that presumably receive direct thalamic input adapts less in response to high-intensity stimuli than in the case of low-intensity stimuli. The above results indicate that our initial hypothesis does not hold in layer 4 of the primary somatosensory cortex, and thus sensory adaptation cannot be fully explained by short-term plasticity models. This intriguing outcome led us to seek the source of this phenomenon subcortically. Could our observations in the cortex be explained at the first stage of neuronal encoding of whisker mechanical movements? To examine this possibility, we measured the peripheral firing responses to whisker stimulation prior to the recruitment of any synapses. We recorded the responses of single units in the trigeminal ganglion (TG, n = 13). These neurons are the first-order sensory neurons in the vibrissal pathway and innervate the whisker follicles directly. Although TG neurons respond with high temporal precision (Arabzadeh et al., 2006Arabzadeh E. Panzeri S. Diamond M.E.

Coding of deflection velocity and amplitude by whisker primary afferent neurons: implications for higher level processing.Somatosens. Mot. Res. 2000; 17: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we verified that arbitrary choice of bin size does not affect our results by quantifying adaptation at the two extremes of temporal precision. On the one hand, we measured the ratio of the population PSTH peak response to each stimulus in the train and that of the first stimulus at 1ms accuracy, which is approximately the jitter of single responses (peak response adaptation ratio, Figure 2B ). On the other hand, we compared the total number of spikes evoked by each stimulus to that evoked by the first stimulus, regardless of exact spike timing (spike count adaptation ratio; Figure 2D). The population PSTH is commonly used as an estimate for the input to downstream layers (Sarid et al., 2007Sarid L. Bruno R. Sakmann B. Segev I. Feldmeyer D. Modeling a layer 4-to-layer 2/3 module of a single column in rat neocortex: interweaving in vitro and in vivo experimental observations.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 16353-16358Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); therefore, these measures serve as a proxy for the input to downstream sensory processing stations. These data verify that stronger stimuli result in higher firing probability (Figure 2A) and a greater number of spikes per stimulus (Figure 2C). We found that responses of TG cells to repetitive stimulation adapt much less than cortical responses. Since no synapses are involved in the sensory processing at the TG stage, we expect no difference in the adaptation patterns evoked by the two stimulus conditions. The peak response adaptation ratio pointed toward slightly less adaptation for the weak stimulation (Figure 2B). This difference proved statistically significant when comparing the steady-state response (taken to be the average response to the last five stimuli) in the two conditions (p < 0.01, n = 13, two-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test). The spike count adaptation ratio showed no difference between the two conditions (Figure 2D). Since more spikes are evoked per whisker deflection by the high-intensity stimulus and given that no major difference was found in the adaptation pattern for the two intensities, neurons downstream to the trigeminal nucleus should adapt more in response to high-intensity stimulation, due to synaptic depression. The lack of adaptation in first-order TG cells and the clear discrepancy between the predictions of the classical short-term synaptic plasticity model and the adaptation patterns observed in cortex led us to investigate the direct feed-forward thalamic input to cortical layer 4 in order to shed light on the source of these unexpected adaptation patterns. Previous studies showed that the VPM provides the major subcortical input to layer 4 cells in the barrel cortex (Bruno and Sakmann, 2006Bruno R.M. Sakmann B. Cortex is driven by weak but synchronously active thalamocortical synapses.Science. 2006; 312: 1622-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar, Gil et al., 1999Gil Z. Connors B.W. Amitai Y.

Lavallée P. Deschênes M. Parallel streams for the relay of vibrissal information through thalamic barreloids.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7455-7462PubMed Google Scholar). Similar to the cortex, adaptation of VPM responses is believed to result from synaptic depression (Deschênes et al., 2003Deschênes M. Timofeeva E. Lavallée P. The relay of high-frequency sensory signals in the Whisker-to-barreloid pathway.J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 6778-6787PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, as previously explained, we expected that thalamic cells will adapt more in response to high-intensity stimulation, compared to the low-intensity condition. Using high-impedance glass electrodes (see Experimental Procedures), we recorded extracellularly the spikes of single VPM neurons responding to strong and weak repetitive stimulation (n = 32). Clearly, and even more pronounced than in cortex, the responses to high-intensity stimulation adapted significantly less than the responses in the low-intensity condition (Figures 3A–3D , p < 10−10 for the steady-state response of both PSTH peak and spike-count ratio, one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test). Considering the sensory responses of TG neurons, these results seem to contradict the assumption that adaptation of VPM responses is purely a result of synaptic depression. Intensity-dependent adaptation may result from rapid feed-forward mechanisms that control the gain of the adaptation process instantaneously, or it may involve much slower timescales. To test this, we applied a recovery protocol to a subset of recorded thalamic cells (n = 7). As before, we delivered a train of 20 stimuli at 18 Hz, but in addition we delivered a test stimulus of the same intensity as the train, 1, 2.3, or 5 s after the end of the train (Figure 4A ). Recovery was quantified in a similar way to adaptation, by measuring either the ratio of the PSTH peak or the spike count for the test response and the first response. Similarly to high-frequency stimulus trains, the test responses to high-intensity stimuli exhibited significantly better recovery (i.e., less adaptation) on timescales of up to 5 s. Responses to high-intensity stimuli fully recovered and even facilitated after 1 s (peak recovery ratio 1.11 ± 0.16), whereas responses to low-intensity stimuli remained significantly depressed even after 5 s (peak recovery ratio 0.84 ± 0.08, p < 0.01, one-sided one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 7). Significant differences between the two conditions were evident at all timescales for the peak recovery ratio (Figure 4B) and after 1 s in the spike-count recovery ratio as well (Figure 4C, p < 0.05, one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test, n = 7). Slow recovery from stimulus trains and adaptation to high-frequency stimulation display the same dependency on stimulus intensity: low-intensity stimuli adapt more and recover more slowly. This suggests that these two phenomena may share common mechanisms with slow kinetic components, on timescales of seconds. Neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus (RT) receive excitatory input from the VPM and cortex, and in turn, send feedback inhibition to the VPM. The RT constitutes the only known source of inhibitory input to VPM cells (Pinault, 2004Pinault D. The thalamic reticular nucleus: structure, function and concept.Brain Res. Brain Res. Rev. 2004; 46: 1-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, Shosaku et al., 1989Shosaku A. Kayama Y. Sumitomo I. Sugitani M. Iwama K. Analysis of recurrent inhibitory circuit in rat thalamus: neurophysiology of the thalamic reticular nucleus.Prog. Neurobiol. 1989; 32: 77-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Previous studies report that RT responses adapt much more than thalamic responses in response to high-frequency repetitive stimulation (Hartings et al., 2003Hartings J.A. Temereanca S. Simons D.J. Processing of periodic whisker deflections by neurons in the ventroposterior medial and thalamic reticular nuclei.J. Neurophysiol. 2003; 90: 3087-3094Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, Yu et al., 2009Yu X.J. Xu X.X. Chen X. He S. He J. Slow recovery from excitation of thalamic reticular nucleus neurons.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 980-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It is possible therefore that reduced firing of RT neurons due to adaptation during repetitive stimulation may disinhibit the VPM, causing a recovery of VPM responses and thus may explain the unexpected adaptation pattern of thalamic cells. Simultaneous paired whisker-aligned recordings of VPM single units and multiunit activity in the RT (n = 5) supported this conjecture. We observed that while VPM responses exhibit some recovery after about the tenth stimulus, RT responses recover much less, if at all (Figure 5A ). We therefore speculated that RT responses to high-intensity stimuli will depress more profoundly than the responses to low-intensity stimuli and thus disinhibit the VPM, resulting in less adaptation to stronger stimuli. Though RT neurons receive input from the VPM, adaptation of multiunit activity in the RT (n = 11) did not display the same dependence on stimulus intensity observed in the VPM. The PSTH peak response adaptation ratio was smaller for the steady-state response to the high-intensity stimulus (Figures 5C and 5D p < 10−10, n = 11, one-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank test), indicating greater adaptation to the stronger stimulus, as predicted by our initial hypothesis, while the spike-count adaptation ratio showed no significant difference between the two conditions (Figures 5E and 5F). This result can, in theory, provide an explanation to our surprising observations in VPM and cortex, but it is not sufficient to conclude that feedback inhibition is the cause. Our next goal was to examine if indeed thalamic feed-back mechanisms are the cause of the intensity-dependent adaptation we observed, or whether it is a property of feed-forward inputs from the brainstem. One approach would be to somehow manipulate or block inhibition (Castro-Alamancos, 2002aCastro-Alamancos M.A. Different temporal processing of sensory inputs in the rat thalamus during quiescent and information processing states in vivo.J. Physiol. 2002; 539: 567-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, Cotillon-Williams et al., 2008Cotillon-Williams N. Huetz C. Hennevin E. Edeline J.M.

Neurophysiol. 2008; 99: 1137-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), but this runs the risk of inadvertently affecting network behavior. To address this question, we proceeded by performing intracellular recordings of VPM neurons. Using sharp electrodes, we recorded the membrane potential of VPM neurons responding to both stimulus conditions (n = 13). In agreement with previous studies, we observed large EPSPs in our recordings (Figure 6A ), which are thought to reflect inputs from few brainstem fibers (Castro-Alamancos, 2002bCastro-Alamancos M.A. Properties of primary sensory (lemniscal) synapses in the ventrobasal thalamus and the relay of high-frequency sensor"
https://openalex.org/W2037232221,"Miniature synaptic currents have long been known to represent random transmitter release under resting conditions, but much remains to be learned about their nature and function in central synapses. In this work, we describe a new class of miniature currents (“preminis”) that arise by the autocrine activation of axonal receptors following random vesicular release. Preminis are prominent in gabaergic synapses made by cerebellar interneurons during the development of the molecular layer. Unlike ordinary miniature postsynaptic currents in the same cells, premini frequencies are strongly enhanced by subthreshold depolarization, suggesting that the membrane depolarization they produce belongs to a feedback loop regulating neurotransmitter release. Thus, preminis could guide the formation of the interneuron network by enhancing neurotransmitter release at recently formed synaptic contacts."
https://openalex.org/W2084845247,"Measles virus (MV), an enveloped negative-strand RNA virus, remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. MV predominantly infects immune cells by using signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM; also called CD150) as a receptor, but it also infects polarized epithelial cells, forming tight junctions in a SLAM-independent manner. Although the ability of MV to infect polarized epithelial cells is thought to be important for its transmission, the epithelial cell receptor for MV has not been identified. A transcriptional repressor, Snail, induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), in which epithelial cells lose epithelial cell phenotypes, such as adherens and tight junctions. In this study, EMT was induced by expressing Snail in a lung adenocarcinoma cell line, II-18, which is highly susceptible to wild-type MV. Snail-expressing II-18 cells lost adherens and tight junctions. Microarray analysis confirmed the induction of EMT in II-18 cells and suggested a novel function of Snail in protein degradation and distribution. Importantly, wild-type MV no longer entered EMT-induced II-18 cells, suggesting that the epithelial cell receptor is down-regulated by the induction of EMT. Other polarized cell lines, NCI-H358 and HT-29, also lost susceptibility to wild-type MV when EMT was induced. However, the complete formation of tight junctions rather reduced MV entry into HT-29 cells. Taken together, these data suggest that the unidentified epithelial cell receptor for MV is involved in the formation of epithelial intercellular junctions."

We constructed a tail-anchored UBC6e variant that requires for its removal from the ER membrane not only YOD1 and p97, two cytosolic proteins involved in the extraction of ER transmembrane or luminal proteins, but also UBXD8, AUP1 and members of the Derlin family.

After cloning cDNA-encoding feline MAP4 and obtaining its deduced amino acid sequence, we characterized by mass spectrometry any site-specific MAP4 dephosphorylation. Solely in pressure overload-hypertrophied myocardium, we identified striking MAP4 dephosphorylation at Ser-472 in the MAP4 N-terminal projection domain and at Ser-924 and Ser-1056 in the assembly-promoting region of the C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of MAP4 cDNA was then used to switch each serine to non-phosphorylatable alanine.

Solely in pressure overload-hypertrophied myocardium, we identified striking MAP4 dephosphorylation at Ser-472 in the MAP4 N-terminal projection domain and at Ser-924 and Ser-1056 in the assembly-promoting region of the C-terminal microtubule-binding domain. Site-directed mutagenesis of MAP4 cDNA was then used to switch each serine to non-phosphorylatable alanine. Wild-type and mutated cDNAs were used to construct adenoviruses; microtubule network density, stability, and MAP4 decoration were assessed in normal cardiocytes following an equivalent level of MAP4 expression. The Ser-924 → Ala MAP4 mutant produced a microtubule phenotype indistinguishable from that seen in pressure overload hypertrophy, such that Ser-924 MAP4 dephosphorylation during pressure overload hypertrophy may be central to this cytoskeletal abnormality."
https://openalex.org/W2009704203,"A major mechanism of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is the active extrusion of toxic compounds through membrane-bound efflux pumps. The TtgR protein represses transcription of ttgABC, a key efflux pump in Pseudomonas putida DOT-T1E capable of extruding antibiotics, solvents, and flavonoids. TtgR contains two distinct and overlapping ligand binding sites, one is broad and contains mainly hydrophobic residues, whereas the second is deep and contains polar residues. Mutants in the ligand binding pockets were generated and characterized using electrophoretic mobility shift assays, isothermal titration calorimetry, and promoter expression. Several mutants were affected in their response to effectors in vitro: mutants H70A, H72A, and R75A did not dissociate from promoter DNA in the presence of chloramphenicol. Other mutants exhibited altered binding to the operator: L66A and L66AV96A mutants bound 3- and 15-fold better than the native protein, whereas the H67A mutant bound with 3-fold lower affinity. In vivo expression assays using a fusion of the promoter of ttgA to lacZ and antibiotic tolerance correlated with the in vitro observations, namely that mutant H67A leads to increased basal expression levels and enhances antibiotic tolerance, whereas mutants L66A and L66AV96A exhibit lower basal expression levels and decreased resistance to antibiotics. The crystal structure of TtgR H67A was resolved. The data provide evidence for the inter-domain communication that is predicted to be required for the transmission of the effector binding signal to the DNA binding domain and provide important information to understand TtgR/DNA/effector interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2058739602,"Skizzle (SkzL), secreted by Streptococcus agalactiae, has moderate sequence identity to streptokinase and staphylokinase, bacterial activators of human plasminogen (Pg). SkzL binds [Glu]Pg with low affinity (K(D) 3-16 mum) and [Lys]Pg and plasmin (Pm) with indistinguishable high affinity (K(D) 80 and 50 nm, respectively). Binding of SkzL to Pg and Pm is completely lysine-binding site-dependent, as shown by the effect of the lysine analog, 6-aminohexanoic acid. Deletion of the COOH-terminal SkzL Lys(415) residue reduces affinity for [Lys]Pg and active site-blocked Pm 30-fold, implicating Lys(415) in a lysine-binding site interaction with a Pg/Pm kringle. SkzL binding to active site fluorescein-labeled Pg/Pm analogs demonstrates distinct high and low affinity interactions. High affinity binding is mediated by Lys(415), whereas the source of low affinity binding is unknown. SkzL enhances the activation of [Glu]Pg by urokinase (uPA) approximately 20-fold, to a maximum rate indistinguishable from that for [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation in the presence of 6-aminohexanoic acid. SkzL binds preferentially to the partially extended beta-conformation of [Glu]Pg, which is in unfavorable equilibrium with the compact alpha-conformation, thereby converting [Glu]Pg to the fully extended gamma-conformation and accelerating the rate of its activation by uPA. SkzL enhances [Lys]Pg and [Glu]Pg activation by single-chain tissue-type Pg activator, approximately 42- and approximately 650-fold, respectively. SkzL increases the rate of plasma clot lysis by uPA and single-chain tissue-type Pg activator approximately 2-fold, confirming its cofactor activity in a physiological model system. The results suggest a role for SkzL in S. agalactiae pathogenesis through fibrinolytic enhancement."
https://openalex.org/W1971833218,"Loss of neuronal protein stargazin (gamma(2)) is associated with recurrent epileptic seizures and ataxia in mice. Initially, due to homology to the skeletal muscle calcium channel gamma(1) subunit, stargazin and other family members (gamma(3-8)) were classified as gamma subunits of neuronal voltage-gated calcium channels (such as Ca(V)2.1-Ca(V)2.3). Here, we report that stargazin interferes with G protein modulation of Ca(V)2.2 (N-type) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Stargazin counteracted the Gbetagamma-induced inhibition of Ca(V)2.2 channel currents, caused either by coexpression of the Gbetagamma dimer or by activation of a G protein-coupled receptor. Expression of high doses of Gbetagamma overcame the effects of stargazin. High affinity Gbetagamma scavenger proteins m-cbetaARK and m-phosducin produced effects similar to stargazin. The effects of stargazin and m-cbetaARK were not additive, suggesting a common mechanism of action, and generally independent of the presence of the Ca(V)beta(3) subunit. However, in some cases, coexpression of Ca(V)beta(3) blunted the modulation by stargazin. Finally, the Gbetagamma-opposing action of stargazin was not unique to Ca(V)2.2, as stargazin also inhibited the Gbetagamma-mediated activation of the G protein-activated K(+) channel. Purified cytosolic C-terminal part of stargazin bound Gbetagamma in vitro. Our results suggest that the regulation by stargazin of biophysical properties of Ca(V)2.2 are not exerted by direct modulation of the channel but via a Gbetagamma-dependent mechanism."

Here, we show that mutations in the C terminus of the first nucleotide binding domain comprising the latest β strands (βc5 and βc6) influence the trafficking, channel activity, and pharmacology of CFTR. We mutated CFTR amino acids located in the βc5-βc6 hairpin, within the βc5 strand (H620Q), within the β-turn linking the two β strands (E621G, G622D), as well as within (S623A, S624A) and at the extremity (G628R) of the βc6 strand. Functional analysis reveals that the current density was largely reduced for G622D and G628R channels compared with wt CFTR, similar for E621G and S624A, but increased for H620Q and S623A. For G622D and G628R, the abnormal activity is likely due to a defective maturation process, as assessed by the augmented activity and mature C-band observed in the presence of the trafficking corrector miglustat.

IntroductionMapping ligand binding sites within ionic channel structures is important to understand the mechanism of action of channel modulators (i.e. activators and inhibitors), to identify regions required for selective interaction with modulators, and to design more selective and more potent agents. Such mapping, called pharmaco-topology, has been performed for the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) regulatory subunits of KATP channels (reviewed in Ref. 1.Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), which are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABCATP-binding cassetteR-domainregulator domainCFcystic fibrosisCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorNBDnucleotide binding domainMPBbenzo[c]quinolizinium compoundwtwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPFskforskolinT50time to obtain 50% of the maximum activation levelpFpicofarad. transporter superfamily (2.Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar). The drug binding sites for several modulators (benzopyran, cromakalim; pyridine, pinacidil; sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, tolbutamide; benzothiadiazine, diazoxide) have been mapped to different predicted transmembrane segments within SUR1 and SUR2A (3.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More recently, the analysis of the experimental three-dimensional structure of P-glycoprotein, another ABC transporter, in an inward-facing conformation revealed a large internal cavity formed from two bundles of six transmembrane helices, which may accommodate several compounds simultaneously (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar).For chloride (Cl−) channels in general and for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein in particular, such pharmaco-topology is missing. CFTR (ABCC7) also belong to the ABC transporter superfamily (2.Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar) and forms a Cl− channel whose gating depends on the intracellular equilibrium of cAMP and ATP amounts (5.Aleksandrov A.A.

Furthermore, there is a complex and fine tuned regulation between the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unique regulatory (R)-domain and the fundamental ABC regulation mode by ATP binding/hydrolysis occurring on NBDs (nucleotide binding domains 1 and 2). Because mutations of the CFTR gene caused cystic fibrosis (CF), several studies have been conducted aiming at identifying original, selective, potent, and therapeutically active small molecules. Despite the fact that numerous and diverse chemical scaffolds are now available, no pharmacophore has been identified, and surprisingly, very few drug binding sites have been mapped on the CFTR protein. However, studies with the CFTR activator isoflavonoid genistein highlighted the contribution of glycine residues Gly551 and Gly1349 of NBD1 and NBD2 domains, respectively, to the pharmacological modulation of CFTR by genistein (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 9.Melin P. Thoreau V.

Mechanism of inhibition of CFTR activity by glibenclamide or CFTRinh-172 are associated with a positive charge of amino acids located on the third intracellular loop (Lys918) and pore-forming transmembrane domains (Arg347) respectively (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 10.Melin P. Hosy E.

Dérand R. McNeilly C.M. Mettey Y. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Métayé T. Vierfond J.M. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J. Morris M.R. Pereira M.M. Doull I.J. Becq F. McPherson M.A. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4073-4081Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to stimulate the Cl− channel activity of CFTR selectively (12.Marivingt-Mounir C. Norez C. Dérand R. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Nguyen-Huy D. Viossat B. Morgant G. Becq F. Vierfond J.M. Mettey Y. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MPB-91 prevented the degradation of a polypeptide comprising NBD1 and the R-domain of F508del CFTR (13.Stratford F.L. Pereira M.M. Becq F. McPherson M.A. Dormer R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that MPB-91 influences protein trafficking and stimulates the opening of CFTR Cl− channels. Although a direct interaction between the two has not yet been demonstrated, these findings suggest that the mechanism of action is associated with some putative sites or amino acids located most probably on the cytoplasmic domains of CFTR.The alignment of the NBD sequences of human CFTR with those of various ABC transporters revealed conserved amino acids in this region, outside those belonging to motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis (14.Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Among them there are two glycine residues in position 622 and 628 located at the C terminus of NBD1, within a β hairpin formed by the two latest β strands (βc5 and βc6, c indicating the participation of these two β strands into the NBD1 β sheet core) of the domain (Fig. 1). Interestingly, when individually mutated, these amino acids cause CF (15.Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We have mutated these two glycine residues in aspartic acid (G622D) and arginine (G628R) and considered other mutants in their neighborhood (H620Q, E621G, S623A, and S624A). To understand better the importance of this region, the activity and pharmacology of wild-type (wt) and mutated CFTR proteins were explored.DISCUSSIONIn the present work we have identified the C terminus of NBD1 as an important region with structural features that are essential for CFTR trafficking and amino acids that are involved in the mechanism of activation of CFTR channels as well as in the pharmacological effect of the CFTR agonists and MPB dual activity compounds. The C-terminal region of NBD1 and in particular the fragment comprising amino acids 622–634 have already been shown to be crucial for the maturation process of CFTR proteins (27.Chan K.W. Csanády L. Seto-Young D. Nairn A.C. Gadsby D.C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 163-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Using Western blot analysis, we now observed a strong decrease of the mature-glycosylated form for the two mutants G622D and G628R. This suggests a defective maturation process due to impairment of the folding process or to a lower stability of the folded protein and highlights the importance of these two amino acids for this process. However, despite the defective maturation, we recorded a cAMP-dependent Cl− current, indicating a plasma membrane expression of these mutants.Stabilization of C-terminal NBD1 Region and CFTR MaturationWe considered the structural information provided by the models of the three-dimensional structure of CFTR (14.Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2594-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 29.Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3469-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) to evaluate the possible impact of the mutations studied herein (Fig. 1A). All of the mutated amino acids belong to a β hairpin, formed by two adjacent β strands (strands βc5 and βc6) (Fig. 1B). The two antiparallel β strands are linked by a type I′ β turn (defined as four consecutive residues allowing the polypeptide chain folding back on itself; Fig. 1B). Because of its unique ϕ-ψ torsion angles, located in a characteristic region on the Ramachandran plot, the third residue of a type I′ β turn is always a glycine; substitution of this glycine by any other residue would cause steric hindrance. In CFTR, substitution of this third residue, Gly622 (ϕ = 70°, ψ = 4°) by an aspartic acid would thus perturb the local structure or even affect the folding process itself.Although Gly622 is located in a turn participating in the interface between the two NBDs, Gly628 is located on the other side of the domain, at the extremity of the last β strand (βc6), which is immediately followed by the last helix of the domain (Fig. 1C). Gly628 is buried within the NBD1 structure, and substitution of this amino acid by an arginine, possessing a long side chain, would lead to steric hindrance with the NBD1 last helix. Consistently, the defect in the maturation process induced by the G622D and G628R mutations, which causes the retention of the mutated CFTR protein, can be clearly explained by the key role of these glycine residues at the structure level. However, mutation of these glycine residues also affects the Cl− function of the channels. Although the trafficking of the mutated proteins was improved by the corrector miglustat, the level of cAMP-dependent Cl− current remained clearly below that of wt channels under the stimulation by Fsk. Therefore, stabilization of this region encompassing the Gly622 and Gly628 seems to be required for correct trafficking and chloride channel functions.On the contrary, mutations of the amino acids located on both sides of the β hairpin type I′ turn should not affect the local structure or folding process, as assessed by the mature glycosylated forms of the mutated proteins. Instead and interestingly, some of these mutations impacted on the channel gating. In particular, the cAMP-activated Cl− current densities elicited by H620Q and S623A channels were increased compared with wt. Moreover, the variation of the time to reach the maximum activation level indicates that the mutated channels could be activated more rapidly than wt. For H620Q mutant, this increase could be explained by the reported increased of open probability (15.Vankeerberghen A. Wei L. Jaspers M. Cassiman J.J. Nilius B. Cuppens H. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1761-1769Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These two amino acids correspond to the first (i) and fourth (i+3) residues of the type I′ turn and form through their main chain N and O atoms the two first hydrogen bonds of the antiparallel β strands (Fig. 1B). The change of the lateral chain of one of them, resulting from their substitution by another amino acid, might not, in principle, disturb these bonds and should thus not destabilize the local structure of the β hairpin. According to the model of the CFTR three-dimensional structure, the side chain of His620, however, is in tight contact with Ser459, located in the walker A motif (P-loop) of NBD1, participating in the noncanonical ATP binding site (Fig. 1B). The H620Q mutation might thus disturb the contacts existing between the β hairpin and the P-loop of NBD1 and thus might result in a perturbation of the channel gating through an effect on the ATP binding and/or hydrolysis in the noncanonical site. One could hypothesize that an enhancement of ATP binding and/or decrease of ATP hydrolysis at this site might favor the open state of the channel. On the contrary, mutation of the neighbor amino acids (Glu621 and Ser624) did not modify the kinetic parameters of the mutated channels. Their side chains do not establish any particular contacts with critical parts of the molecule, and consequently, their mutation in another amino acid should not alter CFTR function. Indeed, our recordings of Cl currents supported by CFTR mutants E621G and S624A were not different from the non-mutated channels stimulated either by Fsk or by MPB agents.NBD1 C Terminus and Drug Interacting SitesAfter having explored the functionality of the mutated channel, we studied the effect of MPB-91 on these mutants. As expected, MPB-91 was able to activate wt CFTR in presence or in absence of Fsk. In addition, MPB-91 was also able to activate H620Q, E621G, S623A, and S624A mutants. The Cl− current densities elicited by these mutants, except for E621G, were similar to wt. Contrary to the activation by Fsk, no difference of kinetic parameters was detected with the two mutants H620Q and S623A. This suggests an activation pathway independent of the cAMP-activating pathway. In contrast, for the two mutants G622D and G628R, no activation was recorded in the presence of MPB-91 or other MPB compounds. One could hypothesize that the absence of response might be due to a folding or stability defect, according to the structural key role of Gly622 and Gly628. Thus, the lack of sensitivity of the mutated channels to MPB would be unspecific, and in this case, we should therefore have also observed a similar lack of effect with other CFTR modulators. However, this is not the case since xanthine (isobutylmethylxanthine), RP-107, or isoflavonoide (genistein) successfully stimulated the channel activity of G622D and G628R CFTR channels. Therefore, one could hypothesize that the mechanism of activation of CFTR by MPB was itself affected by the mutations G622D and G628R and that the binding site of MPB might be located, on the folded protein, in the vicinity of the last β hairpin of CFTR NBD1. However, the perturbation induced by the G622D and G628R mutations on the overall NBD1 structure might be felt at long range and thus influence potential binding sites, which may be distant at the three-dimensional level.For the CFTR E621G mutant, Cl− current activated by MPB-91 was increased compared with wt. Glu621 corresponds to the second residue of the type I′ β turn and participates in the NBD heterodimer interface (Fig. 1B). The head-to-tail conformation of the two NBDs implies that, in the open form of the CFTR channel (outward-facing conformation) (14.Callebaut I. Eudes R. Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 230-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28.Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 2594-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), the ATP binding sites are formed by the Walker A and Walker B motifs of one NBD and the ABC signature sequence of the other NBD. A sliding of the two NBDs has been predicted to occur when CFTR evolves toward a closed form of the channel (inward-facing conformation) (29.Mornon J.P. Lehn P. Callebaut I. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3469-3486Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) in which, according to the conformation observed of a closed-apo conformer in MsbA, the two Walker A/Walker B motifs face each other. It is interesting to note that Glu621 might interact with an amino acid located in the NBD1 α subdomain (Gln1330; open channel, Fig. 1B) or with a NBD2 P-loop residue (Arg1245; closed channel, data not shown). Thus, one might hypothesize that the E621G mutation may reinforce the effect of MPB-91 by acting on critical features of the NBD interface, for example by contributing to reinforce it.Dual Activity Pharmacological AgentsDevelopment of dual activity compounds is an attractive option for a pharmacological therapy in CF. Indeed a single molecule could be used for rescuing CFTR misprocessed mutants at the cellular membrane and for restoring its Cl− channel function once located at the apical plasma membrane. The molecular mechanism of action of dual activity compounds is unknown despite the fact it remains a major challenge for development of more active and less toxic lead compounds. We showed that the dual activity MPB compounds do not alter directly the intracellular levels of cAMP or ATP (18.Becq F. Mettey Y. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J. Dormer R.L. Merten M. Métayé T. Chappe V.

The dimeric organization of the two NBDs is also a key feature for an optimal catalytic activity of CFTR (34.Kidd J.F. Ramjeesingh M. Stratford F. Huan L.J. Bear C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41664-41669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In view of the present results concerning MPB and CFTR, it is tempting to hypothesize that MPB might promote or stabilize these crucial interdomain interactions. Altogether our findings that the β hairpin, formed by two adjacent β strands (strands βc5 and βc6) influences the trafficking and the channel activity of CFTR and that the pharmacological effects of MPB are affected by mutating the β hairpin support the dual activity nature of these compounds. This region of CFTR could thus be targeted to design more selective and more potent dual activity CFTR modulators. IntroductionMapping ligand binding sites within ionic channel structures is important to understand the mechanism of action of channel modulators (i.e. activators and inhibitors), to identify regions required for selective interaction with modulators, and to design more selective and more potent agents. Such mapping, called pharmaco-topology, has been performed for the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) regulatory subunits of KATP channels (reviewed in Ref. 1.Babenko A.P. Aguilar-Bryan L. Bryan J. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 667-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), which are members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) 3The abbreviations used are: ABCATP-binding cassetteR-domainregulator domainCFcystic fibrosisCFTRcystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulatorNBDnucleotide binding domainMPBbenzo[c]quinolizinium compoundwtwild typeGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPFskforskolinT50time to obtain 50% of the maximum activation levelpFpicofarad. transporter superfamily (2.Dean M.

The drug binding sites for several modulators (benzopyran, cromakalim; pyridine, pinacidil; sulfonylurea, glibenclamide, tolbutamide; benzothiadiazine, diazoxide) have been mapped to different predicted transmembrane segments within SUR1 and SUR2A (3.Babenko A.P. Gonzalez G. Bryan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 717-720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). More recently, the analysis of the experimental three-dimensional structure of P-glycoprotein, another ABC transporter, in an inward-facing conformation revealed a large internal cavity formed from two bundles of six transmembrane helices, which may accommodate several compounds simultaneously (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar).For chloride (Cl−) channels in general and for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein in particular, such pharmaco-topology is missing. CFTR (ABCC7) also belong to the ABC transporter superfamily (2.Dean M. Rzhetsky A. Allikmets R. Genome Res. 2001; 11: 1156-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar) and forms a Cl− channel whose gating depends on the intracellular equilibrium of cAMP and ATP amounts (5.Aleksandrov A.A.

Furthermore, there is a complex and fine tuned regulation between the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the unique regulatory (R)-domain and the fundamental ABC regulation mode by ATP binding/hydrolysis occurring on NBDs (nucleotide binding domains 1 and 2). Because mutations of the CFTR gene caused cystic fibrosis (CF), several studies have been conducted aiming at identifying original, selective, potent, and therapeutically active small molecules. Despite the fact that numerous and diverse chemical scaffolds are now available, no pharmacophore has been identified, and surprisingly, very few drug binding sites have been mapped on the CFTR protein. However, studies with the CFTR activator isoflavonoid genistein highlighted the contribution of glycine residues Gly551 and Gly1349 of NBD1 and NBD2 domains, respectively, to the pharmacological modulation of CFTR by genistein (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 9.Melin P. Thoreau V.

Mechanism of inhibition of CFTR activity by glibenclamide or CFTRinh-172 are associated with a positive charge of amino acids located on the third intracellular loop (Lys918) and pore-forming transmembrane domains (Arg347) respectively (4.Aller S.G. Yu J. Ward A. Weng Y. Chittaboina S. Zhuo R. Harrell P.M. Trinh Y.T. Zhang Q. Urbatsch I.L. Chang G. Science. 2009; 323: 1718-1722Crossref PubMed Scopus (1600) Google Scholar, 10.Melin P. Hosy E.

Dérand R. McNeilly C.M. Mettey Y. Bulteau-Pignoux L. Métayé T. Vierfond J.M. Gray M.A. Galietta L.J. Morris M.R. Pereira M.M. Doull I.J. Becq F. McPherson M.A. J.

Viossat B. Morgant G. Becq F. Vierfond J.M. Mettey Y. J. Med. Chem. 2004; 47: 962-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). MPB-91 prevented the degradation of a polypeptide comprising NBD1 and the R-domain of F508del CFTR (13.Stratford F.L. Pereira M.M. Becq F. McPherson M.A. Dormer R.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 524-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that MPB-91 influences protein trafficking and stimulates the opening of CFTR Cl− channels. Although a direct interaction between the two has not yet been demonstrated, these findings suggest that the mechanism of action is associated with some putative sites or amino acids located most probably on the cytoplasmic domains of CFTR.The alignment of the NBD sequences of human CFTR with those of various ABC transporters revealed conserved amino acids in this region, outside those belonging to motifs involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis (14.Callebaut I.

https://openalex.org/W2093144173,"The human NAD-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is a heterotetrameric mitochondrial enzyme with 2alpha:1beta:1gamma subunit ratio. The three subunits share 40-52% identity in amino acid sequence and each includes a tyrosine in a comparable position: alphaY126, betaY137, and gammaY135. To study the role of the corresponding tyrosines of each of the subunits of human NAD-IDH, the tyrosines were mutated (one subunit at a time) to Ser, Phe, or Glu. Enzymes were expressed with one mutant and two wild-type subunits. The results of characterization of the mutant enzymes suggest that betaY137 is involved in NAD binding and allosteric activation by ADP. The alphaY126 is required for catalytic activity and likely acts as a general acid in the reaction. The gammaY135 is also required for catalytic activity and may be involved in proper folding of the enzyme. The corresponding tyrosines in the three dissimilar subunits of NAD-IDH thus have distinctive functions."

A new breed of networking applications offers scientists much more than typical social networking sites, but how useful are they? Amy Maxmen reports. Social networking sites might significantly advance collaborative research, if only more scientists liked them. Although Web 2.0 offers infinite possibilities for forming online collaborations, traditional social networking sites like Facebook and Twitter and professional networking sites like ResearchGATE and LinkedIn seem to be underused by the scientific community. However, new applications are emerging that help busy researchers with their work, while unobtrusively connecting them through the data they enter online, be it bookmarking a paper or annotating a gene. Biochemist Cameron Neylon at the University of Southampton, UK, who blogs about topics like online lab notebooks, online collaborations, and social networks for scientists, says, “I think the reason why the social networks out there have failed to capture the interest of most scientists is that they solve a problem that most researchers don't think they have. They are based on the presumption that scientists need to find other scientists, whereas most scientists don't feel they have a real problem finding people to connect with. When they want to solve a specific problem, they can simply go to the literature and find an author on the web.” Instead, he says, “Tools that help scientists spend more time at the bench, and allow them to get more out of the time they spend at the computer, will succeed where most of the peripheral distracting networking tools have failed.” Grant funding agencies are becoming interested in social networking applications that can help researchers. For example, last November, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded $27 million in Recovery Act (ARRA) funds to two research teams (http://www.nih.gov/news/health/nov2009/ncrr-02.htm). One team, led by researchers at the University of Florida, is developing a social networking site for scientists called VIVO. And the other team, led by Harvard University Medical School investigators, is developing a networking site named eagle-i to connect scientists to resources like reagents or cell lines located at other institutions. NIH program officer Elaine Collier explains, “There was an opportunity with the ARRA funds to award innovative ideas in biomedical research that would move the field forward, could be done in two years, and could employ a lot of people…Ultimately, our vision is that there will be a national network to find resources and scientists.” However, there is skepticism about whether traditional social networking sites will ever be actively used by scientists if the sites don't provide some other immediate function. “The problem I see with the recent networks funded by the NIH is that they don't seem to be driven by the needs and the problems people have immediately,” says Victor Henning, the founder and director of Mendeley (http://www.mendeley.com), a science literature management tool with features that enable networking. “Sure, Facebook took off when it started at Harvard because it indexed people with photos, and therefore, it could help you find out who that hot girl in your class was. With research, it's a different scenario. It's not hard to find most faculty on the web through a lab homepage or through the literature. What people want is a way to handle accumulating data and ways to manage their workflow.” With Mendeley, Henning hasn't tossed out the concept of social networking for scientists, but rather he's incorporated it into something larger. “We wanted to create software that would have value in itself. So although Mendeley doesn't depend on network effects, there is a social layer on top so that as a result, each document on the site comes with anonymized demographic information about who reads it, what university they're at, and what their academic status is,” says Henning. Unlike sites created to digitize connections between people, Mendeley follows in the footsteps of applications like Last.fm, a popular online radio site that uses social networking software to aggregate people based on commonalities in their listening habits. Henning says, “In traditional networks, like Facebook, you look for friends. The difference in Mendeley is that it's first about connecting data—which articles are related, what those relationships are, and who reads them—and then you let the social network emerge based on those connections.” With more than 40 million monthly users, Last.fm provided Henning with a successful model to follow. Because Last.fm operates in the so-called internet “cloud” looming above personal computers, it has the computing space and power needed to analyze vast amounts of data about the music people play. Henning wanted to emulate Last.fm using research papers rather than music as currency. Mendeley helps investigators to index and organize the pdfs they comb through. And Mendeley's social networking features help scientists discover new papers by revealing what the most popular papers are each week and which scientists read them. Mendeley's online predecessor, CiteULike (http://www.citeulike.org), helps scientists to discover new references through social networking features as well. By clicking on manuscripts online, researchers add citations to a running list kept on the web that is searchable by tagged words. Because the lists are public by default, users can see who maintains libraries like theirs. And with “watchlists,” they can track those users to find out when they add a reference. Unlike traditional social networking applications designed to connect people from the outset, these sites operate on a model best described by Microsoft software developer Jon Udell, who says, “Data finds people, then people find people.” The rise of “cloud computing” should be a major asset to scientists who analyze “exafloods” of data transmitted over the Internet. By using a third party to host data, cloud-based software can generally analyze information faster and for less money than projects run on local computer clusters. Investigators working in bioinformatics, genomics, and astrophysics have been among the first to embrace cloud computing because of the huge datasets generated and the computational power needed to analyze them. Likewise, applications that store loads of data and run the statistics required for social networking features tend to operate in the cloud as well. “I'm making the assumption that latent social networks will begin to launch as the use of cloud computing increases, because the more data you have on the web, the more you can start looking for these hidden connections,” Henning says. Seeing the potential for how cloud computing can benefit researchers, the National Science Foundation (NSF) announced in February this year that it would team up with Microsoft to offer free access to cloud computing resources for 3 years to researchers with winning proposals presenting clever ways to exploit cloud capabilities. Jeannette Wing, the head of Computer and Information Science and Engineering at the NSF, is encouraging investigators to team up with computer scientists when developing their ideas. She says, “Once data sets get large, investigators can't just ftp each other data. And it's also not clear what institutions are able to host a lot of data, so putting it all in the cloud is a trend that's going to happen.” Gene annotation and other curatorial sites already take a collaborative approach by relying on contributions from the scientific community, and with the right software they can connect scientists through their activity online. With his gene annotation project, BioGPS, Andrew Su, associate director of bioinformatics at the Genomics Institute of the Novartis Research Foundation in San Diego, California, is testing out the theory that latent communities that form within an application as people contribute to the site make the site more useful over time. “A big question now is how to engage communities of scientists to collaboratively work together,” Su says. “The internet enables us to collaboratively do science, and I'm operating on the idea that networks of people can be useful and productive.” In BioGPS, investigators decide what gene-related content they'd like to see on a webpage. Su compares it to customizable iGoogle homepages, except that instead of opting to see updates on weather, celebrities, and the local news, users choose to see gene lists, 3D crystal structures, and gene expression data. They can also import small computer programs, called plugins, when the information they'd like to see isn't already in BioGPS. Of the 200 or so plugins added to BioGPS since its launch in 2008, several reveal molecular biology reagents available for a gene of interest, others show biological pathways relevant to a gene, and still others provide alternative splicing information. As users customize their profiles they automatically feed information into the system, which enables latent connections to form. With social networking features, BioGPS computes what the most popular plugins are, and soon, it will let users know who maintains a gene list similar to theirs, unless the user requests privacy. “Discovered similarities with other users could in some cases be more valuable than the original reason a user came to BioGPS, which was to view gene information provided by the plugins,” Su says. In order to encourage researcher participation in Rfam, a database of RNA annotations and alignments, Alex Bateman, a computational biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute near Cambridge, UK, lures researchers with publication incentives. Wikipedia automatically feeds annotation information into Rfam. And because Rfam benefits by having data first entered into Wikipedia where Wikipedia's online community edits the entry, Bateman has convinced the editors at the journal RNA Biology to add a requirement for publication of RNA families. In addition to submitting a manuscript to the journal, authors must write or update a short Wikipedia page that summarizes their work. As a result, researchers contribute as a means to publish but end up collaborating on an online project. And they tend to keep an eye on their pages long after publication, says Bateman, who monitors the back-and-forth edits that occur on RNA pages over time. “I wouldn't say I was a big believer in Web 2.0. But I was taken on board as it delivered useful things. I must say that social networking and the community style of Web 2.0 has been fantastic for enabling community annotation,” he says. David Lipman, director of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), comments, “The funny thing about Rfam is that you'd think there would be many more databases like this. Everybody who does a curated database in biology thinks about how we can leverage Wikipedia for scientific curation.” GenBank, one of NCBI's great online successes, has relied on community input since the late eighties. But unlike Wikipedia, the authors' original contributions remain more or less frozen in time. Wikipedia, and related “Wiki” websites, evolve as various contributors add and edit them over time. Networks of people collaborate to keep these sites up-to-date. And although the information uploaded is not always accurate, volunteer editors have been shown to weed out most inaccuracies quickly. Science-related Wiki pages are multiplying. For example, researchers add and edit protocols and other laboratory-related information on the Wiki OpenWetWare; biologists catalog gene functions on WikiGenes; and they enter data on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) into SNPedia. NIH immunologist Ron Germain can easily imagine how a Wikipedia-like website that counted on community participation could help systems biologists. “It would be great to have one place where systems biology people could share their models, download, use, and add to existing models. I don't care if it's pre- or post-publication, it's just a matter of having a simple way to share things over the Web.” The lure of sites like these is that a researcher may be more apt to participate because the site directly contributes to their research. Lipman questions why universities haven't pounced on Wikipedia and Wiki pages. “What I wonder is why professors don't curate [pages on] Wikipedia and add course materials and open access sections of textbooks, much of which they post online anyways. We aren't really seeing the potential that you would hope for with all of the Web 2.0 tools out there. We aren't seeing the academic community take advantage of them as much as other subsets of the community.” He adds, “I feel that if you really wanted to see these things move more quickly, it's not the funding agencies that have to lead but the universities. If they don't, the intellectual center of mass will move off of the university campus and onto the Web and into the cloud. Academics should be using these tools already. And, in fact, there could be a huge risk if universities don't get more involved in social networking and in Web 2.0 to create a center of gravity for education and research. You could imagine the reputation of a university being incredibly enhanced if more people used resources that might easily be posted online. The academic response to the potential out there has not been that inspired.” So will these new applications that subtly bring together networks of researchers for reasons other than social networking entice more scientists? “The thing about social networks is, that for all intents and purposes, this is only about five years old. And so everything feels new and shiny, but these things are actually very immature,” says biochemist and blogger Neylon. “So what we should really be thinking about is what we might want in the future.”"
https://openalex.org/W2032392499,"The sacking of David Nutt from his position as Chair of a UK government science advisory council has thrown the interface between science and policy into sharp relief. Justine Davies takes a look behind the scenes. The sacking of David Nutt from his position as Chair of a UK government science advisory council has thrown the interface between science and policy into sharp relief. Justine Davies takes a look behind the scenes. At the end of October last year, after a decade of working with the UK government's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (http://drugs.homeoffice.gov.uk/drugs-laws/acmd), David Nutt, a leading expert on recreational drugs, was accused of lobbying for a change in government policy and sacked from his role as Chair of the committee. His dismissal came after he gave a lecture in which he noted that some recreational drugs, which scientific studies show cause little harm to users, were classified as dangerous according to the UK government's drugs policy. Nutt was invited to give the lecture in his capacity as a scientist, rather than as a government employee, but he was still aware of its political ramifications. “I intended the lecture not to be politically motivated,” he says, “but I was sensitive to the issue of it being potentially political and ran it through the Science Secretariat of the Home Office [in the UK government] beforehand. They even helped me prepare the slides.” Despite these precautions the Home Secretary, Alan Johnson, thought that Nutt had crossed the line between giving advice and advocating for a change in the government's drugs policy and deemed that his position within government was no longer tenable. Nutt says of his sacking that it “will make it very difficult for any scientific advisor to think that they are independent; they will be wondering ‘does every comment need to be scrutinized.’ It also brings into question the independence of many government committees.” Certainly Nutt now thinks that scientists advising government should be within “truly independent committees, where the government can either accept or reject their advice, but they remain completely independent.” The shock at Nutt's dismissal prompted leading members of the UK scientific community to construct a set of “Principles for the Treatment of Independent Scientific Advice” (http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/421). These principles stress the need for government advisors to maintain academic freedom, to be free to communicate their interpretation of evidence, and to be able to operate independently of government and for their advice to be given proper consideration by government. In a positive step, many of these principles have been welcomed by both scientists and the Science and Technology Select Committee of the UK House of Commons (http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology.cfm). There is always some tension at the intersection of science and policy. Scientists are trained to make decisions based on the evidence that their research has presented them with. However, explains John Marburger, who was Chief Scientific Advisor to US President George W. Bush and is former director of the President's Office of Science and Technology Policy or OSTP (http://www.ostp.gov), “very few decisions that governments have to make can be decided unambiguously on scientific evidence. It seems to me that social and ethical considerations are at least as important as scientific considerations when it comes to public health and environmental issues.” Whether the issues are related to drugs policy, stem cell research, or the myriad other subjects that they must consider, the Chief Scientific Advisor to government has a huge remit. In addition, the Chief Scientific Advisor cannot be an advocate for science but rather has to present impartial advice to policy makers. “I think one of the most important jobs of a high-level advisor is to cut through all the advocacy noise and lay out the issues as plainly as possible,” says Marburger. Regarding his broad remit, John Beddington, Chief Scientific Advisor to the UK government says, “I am supposed to advise the Prime Minister and Cabinet on all matters to do with science and engineering. However, given the breadth of science and engineering it is largely impossible for a single individual to be able to do this unaided.” He continues, “I have extended the roles of the CSAs [chief scientific advisors] in each of the major [government] departments so that now every major department of state, including MI5, has a CSA. I meet with this network of CSAs pretty much every 6 weeks. We also have subgroups of this group which deal with, for example, climate change, food security, issues like that. So, part of the job is leading that network of CSAs, who are embedded in each department.” Beddington's counterpart in the US is John Holdren, Chief Scientific Advisor to President Obama and Director of OSTP. Holdren explains that his advice “falls into two broad categories, which are science and technology for policy, and policy for science and technology.” Advice on policy for science and technology covers a wide variety of issues including science and technology education and science and technology workforce issues, in addition to making “recommendations and coordination on issues such as the research and development budgets of the various federal agencies that have large R&D responsibilities,” he says. Providing science and technology advice for policy involves “making sure the President gets independent advice about science and technology germane to whatever policy issues are on his plate.” This means that the 60 staff members at OSTP have to cover scientific topics as diverse as stem cells, space exploration, and climate change. To help with this broad remit, the OSTP works in close consultation with the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology or PCAST (http://www.ostp.gov/cs/pcast). OSTP also regularly calls upon external scientific experts as well as employing experts on longer-term political assignments. “I came from NIH [National Institutes of Health] and I am on a detail here, which means I am ‘on loan’ to this office from my home office,” says Diane DiEuliis, a neuroscientist and Senior Policy Analyst at OSTP. “I deal with issues related to things that were in my scientific experience at NIH. We also have physicists who come in from NASA, ocean specialists from NOAA, and geologists from USGS, to work on space, climate, ocean and energy issues,” she says. Collating and critically analyzing scientific information is just the first part of the job of the Chief Scientific Advisor; the next is communicating this advice to those in government. For this part, says Holdren, “we have the great benefit in this administration of having a leader in President Obama who very clearly and deeply understands the importance of science and technology for the many challenges that we face in this country and around the world. So we have a very good listener and decider with whom we interact on these matters.” Holdren says in a typical week he sees President Obama “two or three times, in different formats. Sometimes it's one on one, sometimes it's in a small group such as the ‘green cabinet,’ which is the set of cabinet members and agency heads who are responsible for energy and environment issues, or an ad hoc set of the President's advisors assembled to brief the President on a particular issue.” In addition to academic excellence, the Chief Scientific Advisor needs many other skills. “People skills are very important for working with a very different set of stakeholders, with ministers at one end and civil servants at another, right through to the public and the stakeholders outside of government,” says Beddington. Holdren points out that “part of being a scientist and being effective at it is the willingness to communicate and the capacity to do so. There are very few problems these days that any single person has all the expertise required to answer.” William Clark, Professor of International Science, Public Policy, and Human Development at the Harvard Kennedy School (http://www.hks.harvard.edu/) says that next to academic credibility, an ability to listen is key. “As you move into giving science advice, for your work to have influence you have to respond to what the policy people feel to be their questions, you can't just give them your answers to the questions you wish they had…This is rather different to what scientists are used to, which is setting out to answer their own research questions.” Clark points out, however, that after listening hard to what people in the policy process want to find out about, science advisors are also in a good position to inform governments about issues that are considered important among the scientific community. “Certainly the policy people didn't realise that climate change was a problem until scientists informed them,” he says. Some questions are chosen by the Chief Scientific Advisor such as the impact of “increasing population and prosperity,” which Beddington has raised, some are chosen by policy makers, and some may be imposed by outside events, such as the earthquake in Haiti. Another essential requirement, he says, is “even handedness. People in the policy process have to believe that the scientists are treating them seriously and have their interests at heart, or that they are, at least, neutral.” Finally, there is the key diplomatic skill of being “respectful of those we are advising,” which Clark believes is “one of the hardest things for many of us to develop.” There are many platforms outside of government through which scientists can provide advice to policymakers. For example, the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) has just launched an initiative called Expert Labs (http://expertlabs.org), with the goal of putting the government in touch with a broad array of scientific experts. Entrepreneur and blogger Anil Dash, Director of Expert Labs, says “We're going to tap into the expertise of the policy community to identify what questions need to be answered, [then] we're going to tap into the technology community to collaboratively build platforms that help get those questions answered, and finally, we'll tap into the science and technology communities to provide the answers themselves.” Dash envisages that contacting experts will be possible “by taking advantage of the social networks they already have, so that contributing to our project takes no more effort than participating in the conversations and communities that experts are already engaged in.” For its inaugural project, Expert Labs, in collaboration with OSTP and AAAS, is requesting help from the scientific community to define the “Grand Challenges” of the 21st century (http://promo.aaas.org/expertlabs/). The main stipulation is that ideas should focus on “hard, unsolved scientific or engineering challenges that will have significant economic or societal impact and address an important national priority.” Scientists have been asked to submit their own ideas and also to comment on President Obama's list of challenges put forward in his Strategy for American Innovation, including smart anti-cancer therapeutics, educational software, intelligent prosthetics, and biological systems to degrade radioactive and toxic waste. Comments and ideas can be submitted using email, Twitter, or Facebook. “Expert Labs is the next logical step toward enhancing the US policy-making process by infusing it with a broad range of expertise,” says Alan Leshner, the CEO of AAAS. He also thinks it will help get more scientists to think about how their work relates to “real-world” decisions. “To succeed,” he says, “the new initiative will require the participation of three different categories of experts: scientists, policy-makers, and technologists. For scientists, this will require a shift in focus beyond the laboratory and a willingness to help identify and responsibly apply the broader implications of their work to society.”"
