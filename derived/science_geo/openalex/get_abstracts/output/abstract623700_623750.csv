https://openalex.org/W2904366212,"Macrophages are key inflammatory immune cells that display dynamic phenotypes and functions in response to their local microenvironment. Major advances have occurred in understanding the transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional differences in various macrophage subsets by in vitro modeling and gene expression and epigenetic profiling for biomarker discovery. However, there is still no standardized protocol for macrophage polarization largely due to the lack of thorough validation of macrophage phenotypes following polarization. In addition, transcriptional regulation is recognized as a major mechanism governing differential macrophage polarization programs and as such, many genes have been identified to be associated with each macrophage subset. However, the functional role of many of these genes in macrophage polarization is still unknown. Moreover, the role of other regulatory mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, in macrophage polarization remains poorly understood. Here, we employed an optimized model of human M1 and M2 macrophage polarization which we used for large-scale transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling. We were unable to demonstrate a role for DNA methylation in macrophage polarization, as no significant changes were identified. However, we observed significant changes in the transcriptomes of M1 and M2 macrophages. Additionally, we identified numerous novel differentially regulated genes involved in macrophage polarization, including CYBB and DHCR7 which we show as important regulators of M1 and M2 macrophage polarization, respectively. Taken together, our improved in vitro human M1 and M2 macrophage model provides new understandings of the regulation of macrophage polarization and candidate macrophage biomarkers."
https://openalex.org/W2901568326,"Identifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities. Source code and the workflow of the proposed methodology are available at https://github.com/Muh-Asif/ASD-genes-prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2904767271,"The underlying mechanisms of Parkinson´s disease are not completely revealed. Especially, early diagnostic biomarkers are lacking. To characterize early pathophysiological events, research is focusing on metabolomics. In this case-control study we investigated the metabolic profile of 31 Parkinson´s disease-patients in comparison to 95 neurologically healthy controls. The investigation of metabolites in CSF was performed by a 12 Tesla SolariX Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS). Multivariate statistical analysis sorted the most important biomarkers in relation to their ability to differentiate Parkinson versus control. The affected metabolites, their connection and their conversion pathways are described by means of network analysis. The metabolic profiling by FT-ICR-MS in CSF yielded in a good group separation, giving insights into the disease mechanisms. A total number of 243 metabolites showed an affected intensity in Parkinson´s disease, whereas 15 of these metabolites seem to be the main biological contributors. The network analysis showed a connection to the tricarboxylic cycle (TCA cycle) and therefore to mitochondrial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress within mitochondria. The metabolomic analysis of CSF in Parkinson´s disease showed an association to pathways which are involved in lipid/ fatty acid metabolism, energy metabolism, glutathione metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2904707964,"Background Exposure to violence has negative consequences on mental health. Armed-conflict in Colombia has widely affected Afro-descendants in the Pacific region. Evidence regarding effectiveness of mental health interventions is lacking in low-income settings, especially in areas with active conflict. The objective of this study is to evaluate an individualized Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA), a transdiagnostic psychotherapy model based on Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy, for adult trauma survivors. Methods and findings A referred sample of 521 adult Afro-descendants from Buenaventura and Quibdó, Colombia, experiencing significant sadness, suffering or fear (score>0.77 in Total Mental Health Symptoms), with history of traumatic experiences, and with associated functional impairment were randomly allocated to CETA intervention, standby group without intervention, but under monthly monitoring, or a Narrative Community-Based Group Therapy. CETA was provided by trained Lay Psychosocial Community Workers without previous mental health experience, supervised by psychologists, during 12–14 weekly, 1.5-hour sessions. Symptoms were assessed with a locally validated survey built based on the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire, the PTSD CheckList–Civilian Version, a qualitative study for additional general symptoms and a gender-specific functional impairment scale. CETA was compared with the control group and the intervention effects were calculated with mixed models using intention to treat analysis. Participant completion of follow-up was 75.1% and 13.2% voluntarily withdrew. Reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms was significant in both municipalities when comparing intervention and control groups (mean difference), with a with a moderate effect size in Buenaventura (Cohen's d = 0.70) and a small effect size in Quibdó (d = 0.31). In Buenaventura, the intervention also had significant effects on depression (large effect size d = 1.03), anxiety (large effect size d = 0.80) and functional impairment (moderate effect size d = 0.70). In Quibdó, it had no significant effect on these outcomes. Changes in Total Mental Health Symptoms were not significant in neither city. Conclusions This trial suggests that CETA, can be effective in improving depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress and function among victims of systematized violence in low-income and active conflict settings. Nonetheless, the difference of effectiveness between the two cities of intervention may indicate that we cannot assume that a mental health intervention known to be effective in one setting will be effective in another, even in similar circumstances and population. This may have special importance when implementing and reproducing these types of intervention in non-controlled circumstances. Further research should address these concerns. Results can be of use by governmental decision-makers when defining mental health programs for survivors.

https://openalex.org/W2904190350,"Background Menstrual exile, also known as Chhaupadi, is a tradition of “untouchability” in far-western Nepal. Forbidden from touching other people and objects, women and girls are required to live away from the community, typically in a livestock shed, during menstruation. We assessed the lived experiences of Chhaupadi among Nepalese adolescent girls in the far-western Achham district of Nepal, observed the safety and sanitation of their living spaces during Chhaupadi, and assessed the perceptions of local adult stakeholders towards the practice of Chhaupadi. Methods We collected data from 107 adolescent girls using a self-administered survey in two local schools in Achham. We also conducted a focus group discussion with seven girls, held key informant interviews, and observed the girls’ living spaces during Chhaupadi, using a checklist. Descriptive statistics of the quantitative survey and thematic analyses of qualitative interviews are presented. Results The majority of the girls (n = 77, 72%) practiced exile, or Chhaupadi, during their menstruation, including 3 (4%) exiled to traditional Chhau sheds, 63 (82%) to livestock sheds, and 11 (14%) to courtyards outside their home. The remaining girls (n = 30, 28%) stayed inside the house, yet practiced some form of menstrual taboos. Of the 77 observed living spaces where the girls stayed during exile, only 30% (n = 23) had a toilet facility. Most exiled girls (97.4%) were restricted from eating dairy products. Participants reported having various psychological problems, including lonliness and difficulty sleeping while practicing Chhaupadi. Three of the girls were physically abused; nine were bitten by a snake. Notably high proportions of the living spaces lacked ventilation/windows (n = 20, 26%), electricity (n = 29, 38%), toilets (n = 54, 70%) and a warm blanket and mattress for sleeping (n = 29, 38%). Our qualitative findings supported our quantitative results. Conclusions Chhaupadi has been condemned by human rights organizations. While the government has banned the practice, implementation on the ban is proceeding slowly, especially in far-western Nepal. Thus, as a temporary measure, public health professionals must work towards promoting the health and safety of Nepalese women and girls still practicing Chhaupadi."
https://openalex.org/W2904722783,"Antimicrobial multidrug-resistant microorganisms (MDRO) can be transmitted between companion animals and their human owners. Aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-E) and Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in different companion animal species. Dogs (n = 192), cats (n = 74), and rabbits (n = 17), treated in a veterinary practice and hospital or living in an animal shelter and private households, were sampled. All facilities were located in a region characterized by a high density of pig production. Nasal, buccal and perianal swabs were enriched and cultured on solid chromogenic selective media. A subgroup of 20 animals (13 dogs, 3 cats, 4 rabbits) was analyzed for the presence of staphylococci other than S. aureus. Amongst all animals (n = 283), twenty dogs (10.4%) and six cats (8.1%) carried S. aureus. MRSA was found in five dogs (2.6%) and two cats (2.7%). Isolates were of spa types t011, t034, t108 (all mecA-positive, ST398), and t843 (mecC-positive, ST130), typical for livestock-associated (LA)-MRSA. Except for one dog, MRSA-positive animals did not have direct contact to husbandry. ESBL-Escherichia coli (blaCTX-M/blaTEM/blaSHV genes) were present in seven dogs (3.6%), one cat (1.4%) possessed a cefotaxime-resistant Citrobacter freundii isolate (blaTEM/blaCMY-2 genes). MDRO carriage was associated with animals from veterinary medical settings (p<0.05). One dog and one rabbit carried methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci. The exclusive occurrence of MRSA lineages typically described for livestock stresses the impact of MDRO strain dissemination across species barriers in regional settings. Presence of ESBL-E and LA-MRSA among pets and probable dissemination in clinical settings support the necessity of a ""One Health"" approach to address the potential threats due to MDRO-carrying companion animals."
https://openalex.org/W2905547533,"Background Cesarean Section (CS) delivery has been increasing rapidly worldwide and Bangladesh is no exception. In Bangladesh, the CS rate has increased from about 3% in 2000 to about 24% in 2014. This study examines trend in CS in Bangladesh over the last fifteen years and implications of this increasing CS rates on health care expenditures. Methods Birth data from Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS) for the years 2000–2014 have been used for the trend analysis and 2010 Bangladesh Maternal Mortality Survey (BMMS) data were used for estimating health care expenditure associated with CS. Results Although the share of institutional deliveries increased four times over the years 2000 to 2014, the CS deliveries increased eightfold. In 2000, only 33% of institutional deliveries were conducted through CS and the rate increased to 63% in 2014. Average medical care expenditure for a CS delivery in Bangladesh was about BDT 22,085 (USD 276) in 2010 while the cost of a normal delivery was BDT 3,565 (USD 45). Health care expenditure due to CS deliveries accounted for about 66.5% of total expenditure on all deliveries in Bangladesh in 2010. About 10.3% of Total Health Expenditure (THE) in 2010 was due to delivery costs, while CS costs contribute to 6.9% of THE and rapid increase in CS deliveries will mean that delivering babies will represent even a higher proportion of THE in the future despite declining crude birth rate. Conclusion High CS delivery rate and the negative health outcomes associated with the procedure on mothers and child births incur huge economic burden on the families. This is creating inappropriate allocation of scarce resources in the poor economy like Bangladesh. Therefore it is important to control this unnecessary CS practices by the health providers by introducing litigation and special guidelines in the health policy."

However, filter paper has a weak binding affinity to plasmid DNA in tested miniprep protocols. Protocols for the use of filter paper recharged spin columns or homemade spin columns for low throughput purification of plant genomic DNA and total RNA with unused commercial kit buffers or less expensive homemade buffers are presented."
https://openalex.org/W2905356835,"Muscle spasticity is characterized by exaggerated stretch reflexes and affects about 85% of the children with cerebral palsy. However, the mechanisms underlying spasticity and its influence on gait are not well understood. Here, we first aimed to model the response of spastic hamstrings and gastrocnemii in children with cerebral palsy to fast passive stretches. Then, we evaluated how the model applied to gait. We developed three models based on exaggerated proprioceptive feedback. The first model relied on feedback from muscle fiber length and velocity (velocity-related model), the second model relied on feedback from muscle fiber length, velocity, and acceleration (acceleration-related model), and the third model relied on feedback from muscle force and its first time derivative (force-related model). The force-related model better reproduced measured hamstrings and gastrocnemii activity during fast passive stretches (coefficients of determination (R2): 0.73 ± 0.10 and 0.60 ± 0.13, respectively, and root mean square errors (RMSE): 0.034 ± 0.031 and 0.009 ± 0.007, respectively) than the velocity-related model (R2: 0.46 ± 0.15 and 0.07 ± 0.13, and RMSE: 0.053 ± 0.051 and 0.015 ± 0.009), and the acceleration-related model (R2: 0.47 ± 0.15 and 0.09 ± 0.14, and RMSE: 0.052 ± 0.050 and 0.015 ± 0.008). Additionally, the force-related model predicted hamstrings and gastrocnemii activity that better correlated with measured activity during gait (cross correlations: 0.82 ± 0.09 and 0.85 ± 0.06, respectively) than the activity predicted by the velocity-related model (cross correlations: 0.49 ± 0.17 and 0.71 ± 0.22) and the acceleration-related model (cross correlations: 0.51 ± 0.16 and 0.67 ± 0.20). Our results therefore suggest that force encoding in muscle spindles in combination with altered feedback gains and thresholds underlie activity of spastic muscles during passive stretches and gait. Our model of spasticity opens new perspectives for studying movement impairments due to spasticity through simulation."
https://openalex.org/W2904368027,"The exploration of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and programming models on noisy near-term quantum hardware has begun. As hybrid programs scale towards classical intractability, validation and benchmarking are critical to understanding the utility of the hybrid computational model. In this paper, we demonstrate a newly developed quantum circuit simulator based on tensor network theory that enables intermediate-scale verification and validation of hybrid quantum-classical computing frameworks and programming models. We present our tensor-network quantum virtual machine (TNQVM) simulator which stores a multi-qubit wavefunction in a compressed (factorized) form as a matrix product state, thus enabling single-node simulations of larger qubit registers, as compared to brute-force state-vector simulators. Our simulator is designed to be extensible in both the tensor network form and the classical hardware used to run the simulation (multicore, GPU, distributed). The extensibility of the TNQVM simulator with respect to the simulation hardware type is achieved via a pluggable interface for different numerical backends (e.g., ITensor and ExaTENSOR numerical libraries). We demonstrate the utility of our TNQVM quantum circuit simulator through the verification of randomized quantum circuits and the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm, both expressed within the eXtreme-scale ACCelerator (XACC) programming model."
https://openalex.org/W2903600347,"Quantum++ is a modern general-purpose multi-threaded quantum computing library written in C++11 and composed solely of header files. The library is not restricted to qubit systems or specific quantum information processing tasks, being capable of simulating arbitrary quantum processes. The main design factors taken in consideration were the ease of use, portability, and performance. The library's simulation capabilities are only restricted by the amount of available physical memory. On a typical machine (Intel i5 8Gb RAM) Quantum++ can successfully simulate the evolution of 25 qubits in a pure state or of 12 qubits in a mixed state reasonably fast. The library also includes support for classical reversible logic, being able to simulate classical reversible operations on billions of bits. This latter feature may be useful in testing quantum circuits composed solely of Toffoli gates, such as certain arithmetic circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2904079913,"Genomic selection is a proven technology in animal and plant breeding to accelerate genetic gain, but as yet is to be fully realised in forest tree breeding. This paper examines, through stochastic simulation, the potential benefits of genomic selection (GS) over forward selection (FS) in a typical conifer breeding program. Methods of speeding the deployment of selected material were also considered, including top-grafting onto mature seed orchard ortets, using additional replicates of clones in archives for crossing, and embryogenesis and clonal propagation. Genetic gain per generation was found to increase considerably when the size of the training population was larger (800 c.f. 3000 clones), or when the heritability was higher (0.2 c.f. 0.5). The largest genetic gain, of 24% was achieved where large training populations (3000 clones) and high heritability traits (0.5) were combined. The accuracy of genomic breeding values (GEBVs) increased with the increase in the number of clones in the training population, the heritability of the trait and the density of the SNP markers. Calculated accuracies of simulated GEBVs and genetic gain per unit of time suggested that 2000 clones in the training population is the minimum size for effective genomic selection for conifers. Compared with forward selection, genomic selection with 2000 clones in the training population, and a 60K SNP panel, an increase of 1.58 mm per year in diameter-at-breast-height (DBH) and 2.44 kg/m3 per year for wood density can be expected. After one generation (9-years), this would be equivalent to 14.23 mm and 21.97 kg/m3 for DBH and wood density respectively. Deploying clones of the selected individuals always resulted in higher additional genetic gain than deploying progeny/seedlings. Deploying genetic material selected from genomic selection with top-grafting for early coning appeared to be the best option. Application of genomic selection to conifer breeding programs, combined with deployment tools such as top-grafting and embryogenesis are powerful tools to speed the delivery of genetic gain to the forest."
https://openalex.org/W2904547200,"Bias accusations have eroded trust in journalism to impartially check facts. Traditionally journalists have avoided responding to such accusations, resulting in an imbalanced flow of arguments about the news media. This study tests what would happen if journalists spoke up more in defense of their profession, while simultaneously also testing effects of doing more fact checking. A five-day field experiment manipulated whether an online news portal included fact check stories and opinion pieces defending journalism. Fact checking was beneficial in terms of three democratically desirable outcomes-media trust, epistemic political efficacy, and future news use intent-only when defense of journalism stories were also present. No partisan differences were found in effects: Republicans, Democrats, and Independents were all affected alike. These results have important implications for journalistic practice as well as for theories and methods of news effects."
https://openalex.org/W2904797528,"Cancer patients with non-central nervous system tumors often suffer from cognitive impairment. While chemotherapy has long been attributed as the cause of these memory, learning and concentration difficulties, we recently observed cognitive impairment in cancer patients prior to treatment. This suggests the cancer alone may be sufficient to induce cognitive impairment, however the mechanisms are unknown. Here, we show that we can experimentally replicate the clinical phenomenon of cancer-associated cognitive impairment and we identify inflammation as a causal mechanism. We demonstrate that a peripheral tumor is sufficient to induce memory loss. Using an othotopic mouse model of breast cancer, we found that mice with 4T1.2 or EO771 mammary tumors had significantly poorer memory than mice without tumors. Memory impairment was independent of cancer-induced sickness behavior, which was only observed during the later stage of cancer progression in mice with high metastatic burden. Tumor-secreted factors were sufficient to induce memory impairment and pro-inflammatory cytokines were elevated in the plasma of tumor-bearing mice. Oral treatment with low-dose aspirin completely blocked tumor-induced memory impairment without affecting tumor-induced sickness or tumor growth, demonstrating a causal role for inflammation in cognitive impairment. These findings suggest that anti-inflammatories may be a safe and readily translatable strategy that could be used to prevent cancer-associated cognitive impairment in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2904819110,"A range of methodologies may be used for analyzing bacteria, depending on the purpose and the level of resolution needed. The capability for recognition of species distinctions within the complex spectrum of bacterial diversity is necessary for progress in microbiological research. In clinical settings, accurate, rapid and cost-effective methods are essential for early and efficient treatment of infections. Characterization and identification of microorganisms, using, bottom-up proteomics, or ""proteotyping"", relies on recognition of species-unique or associated peptides, by tandem mass spectrometry analyses, dependent upon an accurate and comprehensive foundation of genome sequence data, allowing for differentiation of species, at amino acid-level resolution. In this study, the high resolution and accuracy of MS/MS-based proteotyping was demonstrated, through analyses of the three phylogenetically and taxonomically most closely-related species of the Mitis Group of the genus Streptococcus: i.e., the pathogenic species, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), and the commensal species, Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae and Streptococcus mitis. To achieve high accuracy, a genome sequence database used for matching peptides was created and carefully curated. Here, MS-based, bottom-up proteotyping was observed and confirmed to attain the level of resolution necessary for differentiating and identifying the most-closely related bacterial species, as demonstrated by analyses of species of the Streptococcus Mitis Group, even when S. pneumoniae were mixed with S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis, by matching and identifying more than 200 unique peptides for each species."
https://openalex.org/W2952069697,"The frequent use of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic resistance in bacteria, resulting in an increase in infections that are difficult to treat. Livestock are commonly administered antibiotics in their feed, but there is current interest in raising animals that are only administered antibiotics during active infections. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a common pathogen of both humans and livestock raised for human consumption. SA has achieved high levels of antibiotic resistance, but the origins and locations of resistance selection are poorly understood. We determined the prevalence of SA and MRSA in conventional and antibiotic-free (AF) meat products, and also measured rates of antibiotic resistance in these isolates. We isolated SA from raw conventional turkey, chicken, beef, and pork samples and also from AF chicken and turkey samples. We found that SA contamination was common, with an overall prevalence of 22.6% (range of 2.8–30.8%) in conventional meats and 13.0% (range of 12.5–13.2%) in AF poultry meats. MRSA was isolated from 15.7% of conventional raw meats (range of 2.8–20.4%) but not from AF-free meats. The degree of antibiotic resistance in conventional poultry products was significantly higher vs AF poultry products for a number of different antibiotics, and while multi-drug resistant strains were relatively common in conventional meats none were detected in AF meats. The use of antibiotics in livestock contributes to high levels of antibiotic resistance in SA found in meat products. Our results support the use of AF conditions for livestock in order to prevent antibiotic resistance development in SA."
https://openalex.org/W2905195929,"Increasing β-carotene (a vitamin A precursor) content in Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum (durum wheat) grains is important to improve pasta nutritional quality. Studies in other species show that altering the expression of LCYE genes increases the flux towards the β-β branch, accumulating higher β-carotene levels. Durum wheat is a tetraploid species that has two LCYE genes (LCYE-A and LCYE-B) associated to the A and B genomes. The objective of this work was to produce durum wheat LCYE mutants through EMS to potentially increase β-carotene content. The LCYE point mutations created with EMS were identified using a Kronos TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesion IN Genomes) mutant population. Specific primers that amplified exons 3 through 10 of the LCYE genes were designed and validated. To simplify the TILLING procedure, fragments were digested with CJE (Celery Juice Extract) and visualized on 2% agarose gels. 6X mutant pools were identified, which showed cleavage products and then made into 2X pools to identify mutant individuals. LCYE mutants were then sequenced and evaluated with BLOSUM62, SIFT and PSSM algorithms. Mutants with substitutions W437*, P334L and G368R in LCYE-A and P405L, G352R and T393I in LCYE-B predicted to affect protein function were selected. Substitution W437* increased β-carotene in 75% and overall total carotenoids content in leaves of the mutant 2426 (A1 mutant line), but no significant differences relative to the control were found in grains through HPLC. Finally, the increased levels of β-carotene on leaves have potential applications to improving plant resistance under contaminated environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2904491092,"For many years Streptococcus agalactiae has been considered an obligate intramammary and strictly contagious pathogen in dairy cattle. However, recent reports of S. agalactiae isolation from extramammary sources have contradicted that premise. To gain further insight into the epidemiology of S. agalactiae infection in cattle, we examined its distribution and heterogeneity of strains in bovine milk, bovine feces, and the environment in Colombian dairy farms. First, a longitudinal study was conducted at herd level in 152 dairy herds. Bulk tank milk samples from each herd where collected twice a month for six months. A follow-up study with a cross sectional design at the cow level was conducted in a subset of 25 farms positive for S. agalactiae. Cow-level milk samples from 1712 lactatting cows and 1545 rectal samples were collected, as well as 120 environmental samples. Samples were used for S. agalactiae detection and genotyping using Multi Locus Sequence Typing. Results showed sporadic rather than repeated isolation of S. agalactiae from bulk tank milk in 40% of the positive herds, challenging the idea that S. agalactiae is a highly contagious pathogen causing chronic infections. S. agalactiae was isolated from rectal or environmental samples in 32% and 12% of cross-sectional study farms, respectively, demonstrating that the bacteria can survive in extramammary sources and that S. agalactiae is not an obligate intramammary pathogen. The same strain was isolated from rectal and bulk tank milk samples in eight farms, suggesting that fecal shedding is frequent, and contributes to the presence of S. agalactiae in bulk tank. High within-herd heterogeneity of strains was found, which is distinct from the situation in developed dairy industries. These new epidemiological findings should be considered to adjust surveillance and control recommendations for S. agalactiae."
https://openalex.org/W2904626738,"Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) has been used to improve muscle strength and decrease spasticity of the ankle joint in stroke patients. However, it is unclear how NMES could influence dynamic spasticity of ankle plantarflexors and gait asymmetry during walking. The study aimed to evaluate the effects of applying NMES over ankle dorsiflexors or plantarflexors on ankle control during walking and gait performance in chronic stroke patients. Twenty-five stroke participants with inadequate ankle control were recruited and randomly assigned to an experimental or a control group. The experimental group received 20 minutes of NMES on either the tibialis anterior muscle (NMES-TA) or the medial gastrocnemius muscle (NMES-MG). The control group received 20 minutes of range of motion and stretching exercises. After the 20 minutes of NMES or exercises, all participants received ambulation training for 15 minutes. Training sessions occurred 3 times per week for 7 weeks. The pre- and post-training assessments included spatio-temporal parameters, ankle range of motion, and dynamic spasticity of ankle plantarflexors during walking. Muscle strength of ankle dorsiflexors and plantarflexors as well as static spasticity of ankle plantarflexors were also examined. The results showed that the static and dynamic spasticity of ankle plantarflexors of the NMES-TA group were significantly decreased after training. Reduction in dynamic spasticity of ankle plantarflexors of the NMES-TA group was significantly greater than that of the NMES-MG group. When compared to the control group, the NMES-TA group had greater improvements in spatial asymmetry, ankle plantarflexion during push off, and muscle strength of ankle dorsiflexors, and the NMES-MG group showed a significant decrease in temporal asymmetry. In summary, NMES on ankle dorsiflexors could be an effective management to enhance gait performance and ankle control during walking in chronic stroke patients. NMES on ankle plantarflexors may improve gait symmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2904128188,"Chemical treatments are used widely in agricultural and natural settings to protect plants from diseases; however, they may exert an important selection pressure on plant pathogens, promoting the development of tolerant isolates through adaptive evolution. Phosphite is used to manage diseases caused by Phytophthora species which include a large number of the most economically damaging plant pathogens worldwide. Phosphite controls the growth of Phytophthora species in planta without killing it; as a result, isolates can develop tolerance to phosphite after prolonged exposure. We investigated the inter- and intra-specific variability in phosphite tolerance of eleven Phytophthora species, including P. ramorum, an internationally important, highly regulated pathogen. Phytophthora ramorum is a good model system because it is comprised of multiple genetically homogeneous lineages. Seven species were found to be consistently sensitive to phosphite based on the low Effective Concentration (EC) 50 values of all isolates tested (amount of phosphite required to inhibit mycelial growth by 50% relative to growth in the absence of phosphite). However, P. ramorum, P. lateralis, P. crassamura and P. cambivora showed intraspecific variability in sensitivity to phosphite, with at least one isolate showing significantly higher tolerance than the other isolates. Within the three P. ramorum evolutionarily divergent lineages tested, NA1 was the most susceptible to phosphite, the NA1 and EU1 lineages showed intralineage variability and the NA2 lineage showed a decreased sensitivity to phosphite overall as all isolates were relatively tolerant. This finding is relevant because NA1 is dominant in the wild and can be controlled using phosphite, while the EU1 lineage has recently been identified in the wild and is phosphite-tolerant, making the treatment approach potentially less effective. Phytophthora ramorum, P. lateralis and P. crassamura are either selfing, homothallic species, or are known to reproduce exclusively clonally, indicating tolerance to phosphite can emerge even in the absence of sexual recombination."

We used multivariate analyses to test whether the dietary composition of 200 jackal stomachs varied between two 2-yearly survey occasions, the first without big game viscera removal (availability of 68 kg viscera/year/km2) followed by a period with viscera removal (minimum of 50 kg of viscera/year/km2 removed). The proportion of empty stomachs and the stomach wet content weight did not differ between the two periods. Even after the reduction of food subsidies, the primary food of jackals was viscera and carrion from wild ungulates (frequency of occurrence: 45% vs. 30%; wet weight: 55% vs. 29%, respectively), and scavenging was not affected by season or sex. Log-linear analysis of frequency data revealed no significant differences between survey occasions in consumption of either food type. MANCOVA of wet weight data revealed that in the first period with food subsidies jackals consumed a higher proportion of adult wild boar (11.6% vs. 1.3%; from predation or scavenging), while juvenile wild boar (0 vs. 11.8%; from predation or scavenging), domestic animals (0.8% vs. 6.2%; mostly from scavenging) and invertebrates (2.6% vs. 4.1%) increased in the second period. The stomachs in the second survey occasion contained more varied food items, but the trophic niche was not significantly wider. The feeding responses of this mesopredator to the reduction of food subsidies were less pronounced than expected. Because in high big game density areas, wild ungulate carrion from different mortality causes are available in high quantities throughout the year, predator populations can be maintained despite the high amount of viscera removal."
https://openalex.org/W2904030169,"Viral infections are an important cause of death worldwide. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs or vaccines for a large number of viruses, and this represents a remarkable challenge particularly for emerging and re-emerging viruses. For this reason, the identification of broad spectrum antiviral compounds provides a valuable opportunity for developing efficient antiviral therapies. Here we report on a class of rhodanine and thiobarbituric derivatives displaying a broad spectrum antiviral activity against seven different enveloped viruses including an HSV-2 acyclovir resistant strain with favorable selectivity indexes. Due to their selective action on enveloped viruses and to their lipid oxidation ability, we hypothesize a mechanism on the viral envelope that affects the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, thus compromising the efficiency of virus-cell fusion and preventing viral entry."
https://openalex.org/W2904150849,"Fruit development in Lycium ruthenicum Murr. involves a succession of physiological and biochemical changes reflecting the transcriptional modulation of thousands of genes. Although recent studies have investigated the dynamic transcriptomic responses during fruit ripening in L. ruthenicum, most have been limited in scope, and thus systematic data representing the structural genes and transcription factors involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis are lacking. In this study, the transcriptomes of three ripening stages associated with anthocyanin accumulation, including S1 (green ripeness stage), S2 (skin color change) and S3 (complete ripeness stage) in L. ruthenicum were investigated using Illumina sequencing. Of a total of 43,573 assembled unigenes, 12,734 were differentially expressed during fruit ripening in L. ruthenicum. Twenty-five significantly differentially expressed structural genes (including PAL, C4H, 4CL, CHS, CHI, F3H, F3’H, F3’5’H, DFR, ANS and UFGT) were identified that might be associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis. Additionally, several transcription factors, including MYB, bHLH, WD40, NAC, WRKY, bZIP and MADS, were correlated with the structural genes, implying their important interaction with anthocyanin biosynthesis-related genes. Our findings provide insight into anthocyanin biosynthesis and regulation patterns in L. ruthenicum and offer a systematic basis for elucidating the molecular mechanisms governing anthocyanin biosynthesis in L. ruthenicum."

The article aims to study the individual, family and school characteristics of adolescents beginning their sexual lives. The database we used was the 2015 PeNSE (National Adolescent School-based Health Survey) and the methodology was the survival analysis. The results show that boys initiate sexual activity before girls and risky behaviors associated with the use of licit and illicit drugs increase the chance of having early sex. In addition, this work highlights the importance of parental practices in reducing the chances of beginning sexual activity, as well as the presence of school workshops on the risks of pregnancy. It should be noted that intervention strategies need to be differentiated according to gender in order to increase effectiveness."
https://openalex.org/W2904236114,"China has been troubled by high concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) for many years. Up to now, the pollutant sources are not yet fully understood and the control approach still remains highly uncertain. In this study, four month-long (January, April, July and October in 2015) WRF-Chem simulations with different sensitivity experiments were conducted in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region of eastern China. The simulated results were compared with abundant meteorological and air quality observations at 138 stations in 26 YRD cities. Our model well captured magnitudes and variations of the observed PM2.5, with the normal mean biases (NMB) less than ±20% for 19 out of the 26 YRD cities. A series of sensitivity simulations were conducted to quantify the contributions from individual source sectors and from different regions to the PM2.5 in the YRD region. The calculated results show that YRD local source contributed 64% of the regional PM2.5 concentration, while outside transport contributed the rest 36%. Among the local sources, industry activity was the most significant sector in spring (25%), summer (36%) and fall (33%), while residential source was more important in winter (38%). We further conducted scenario simulations to explore the potential impacts of varying degrees of emission controls on PM2.5 reduction. The result demonstrated that regional cooperative control could effectively reduce the PM2.5 level. The proportionate emission controls of 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% and 50% could reduce the regional mean PM2.5 concentrations by 10%, 19%, 28%, 37% and 46%, respectively, and for places with higher ambient concentrations, the mitigation efficiency was more significant. Our study on source apportionment and emission controls can provide useful information on further mitigation actions."
https://openalex.org/W2905082063,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) can induce excitability changes of a stimulated brain area through synaptic plasticity mechanisms. High-frequency (100 Hz) triplets of rTMS synchronized to the negative but not the positive peak of the ongoing sensorimotor μ-rhythm isolated with the concurrently acquired electroencephalography (EEG) resulted in a reproducible long-term potentiation like increase of motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, an index of corticospinal excitability (Zrenner et al. 2018, Brain Stimul 11:374-389). Here, we analyzed the EEG and TMS-EEG data from (Zrenner et al., 2018) to investigate the effects of μ-rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS on EEG-based measures of cortical excitability. We used resting-state EEG to assess μ- and β-power in the motor cortex ipsi- and contralateral to the stimulation, and single-pulse TMS-evoked and induced EEG responses in the stimulated motor cortex. We found that μ-rhythm-phase-dependent burst-rTMS did not significantly change any of these EEG measures, despite the presence of a significant differential and reproducible effect on MEP amplitude. We conclude that EEG measures of cortical excitability do not reflect corticospinal excitability as measured by MEP amplitude. Most likely this is explained by the fact that rTMS induces complex changes at the molecular and synaptic level towards both excitation and inhibition that cannot be differentiated at the macroscopic level by EEG."
https://openalex.org/W2903838011,"Background A growing body of research indicates that cross-cultural competence in nurses can improve migrant patients’ health-related outcomes, but little is known about the potential benefits of cross-cultural competence on the nurses’ own well-being. Objective To examine whether cross-cultural competence (empathy, skills, positive attitudes, and motivation) is associated with perceived time pressure at work, psychological distress, and sleep problems among registered nurses in Finland, and whether there are differences in these potential associations between native and foreign-born nurses. Methods The present cross-sectional study was based on a sample of 212 foreign-born nurses licensed to practice in Finland and a random sample of 744 native Finnish nurses. Data were collected with a questionnaire and analyzed using multiple linear regression and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results Of all four dimensions of cross-cultural competence, only empathy was associated with perceived time pressure (β = –0.13, p = .018), distress (β = –0.23, p < .001), and sleep problems (β = –0.14, p = .004) after the adjustment for gender, age, employment sector, and frequency of interacting with patients and colleagues from different cultures. There were no differences between native and foreign-born nurses in these observed associations (all ps > .05). Conclusions Cross-cultural empathy may protect against perceived time pressure, distress, and sleep problems in both native and foreign-born nurses. Thus, the promotion of this component of cross-cultural competence among nursing personnel should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2903990790,"Leaf angle and leaf orientation value are important traits affecting planting density and photosynthetic efficiency. To identify the genes involved in controlling leaf angle and leaf orientation value, we utilized 1.49×106 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained after sequencing 80 backbone inbred maize lines in Jilin Province, based on phenotype data from two years, and analyzed these two traits in a genome-wide association study (GWAS). A total of 33 SNPs were significantly associated (P<0.000001) with the two target traits. Twenty-two SNPs were significantly associated with leaf angle and distributed on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, explaining 21.62% of the phenotypic variation. Eleven SNPs were significantly associated with leaf orientation value and distributed on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9, explaining 29.63% of the phenotypic variation. Within the mean linkage disequilibrium (LD) distance of 9.7 kb for the significant SNP locus, 22 leaf angle candidate genes were detected, and 3 of these candidate genes harbored significant SNPs, with phenotype contribution rates greater than 10%. Two candidate genes at distances less than 100 bp from significant SNPs showed phenotype contribution rates greater than 8%. Seven leaf orientation value candidate genes were detected: 3 of these candidate genes harbored significant SNPs, with phenotype contribution rates greater than 10%. Eight inbred maize lines with significant differences in leaf angle and leaf orientation value were selected to test candidate gene expression levels from 182 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). The 5 leaf angle candidate genes and 3 leaf orientation value candidate genes were verified using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). The results showed significant differences in the expression levels of the above eight genes between inbred maize lines with significant differences in leaf angle and leaf orientation value."
https://openalex.org/W2904684827,"Mycoplasma gallisepticum is a causative agent of chronic respiratory disease in chickens, typically causing great economic losses. Cytoadherence is the critical stage for mycoplasma infection, and the associated proteins are important for mycoplasma pathogenesis. Many glycolytic enzymes are localized on the cell surface and can bind the extracellular matrix of host cells. In this study, the M. gallisepticum pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha subunit (PDHA) and beta subunit (PDHB) were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their enzymatic activities were identified based on 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol reduction. When recombinant PDHA (rPDHA) and recombinant PDHB (rPDHB) were mixed at a 1:1 molar ratio, they exhibited strong enzymatic activity. Alone, rPDHA and rPDHB exhibited no or weak enzymatic activity. Further experiments indicated that both PDHA and PDHB were surface-exposed immunogenic proteins of M. gallisepticum. Bactericidal assays showed that the mouse anti-rPDHA and anti-rPDHB sera killed 48.0% and 75.1% of mycoplasmas respectively. A combination of rPDHA and rPDHB antisera had a mean bactericidal rate of 65.2%, indicating that rPDHA and rPDHB were protective antigens, and combining the two sera did not interfere with bactericidal activity. Indirect immunofluorescence and surface display assays showed that both PDHA and PDHB adhered to DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cells and adherence was significantly inhibited by antisera against PDHA and PDHB. Adherence inhibition of M. gallisepticum to DF-1 chicken embryo fibroblast cells was 30.2% for mouse anti-rPDHA serum, 45.1% for mouse anti-rPDHB serum and 72.5% for a combination of rPDHA and rPDHB antisera, suggesting that rPDHA and rPDHB antisera may have synergistically interfered with M. gallisepticum cytoadherence. Plasminogen (Plg)-binding assays further demonstrated that both PDHA and PDHB were Plg-binding proteins, which may have contributed to bacterial colonization. Our results clarified the enzymatic activity of M. gallisepticum PDHA and PDHB and demonstrated these compounds as Plg-binding proteins involved in cytoadherence."
https://openalex.org/W2904483675,"Object manipulation requires well-coordinated force vectors involving both magnitudes and directions. Despite extensive studies about force magnitudes during manipulation, relatively little is known how the muscle fatigue could affect the directional coordination of fingertip forces. This study aims to examine the effects of muscle fatigue on inter-digit coordination of force directions during precision grip. Sixteen female subjects performed precision grip with their thumb and index finger before and after fatigue tasks, which required subjects to produce continuous submaximal pinch strength on the apparatus for a duration more than 200 s. Both their left and right hands were evaluated using the same testing protocol. The means and standard deviations of the coordination angle and the projection angle were applied to quantify the directional coordination across the digits and the force vector direction of each individual digit. Results showed that fatigue led to significant reduction in the mean values of coordination angle and that of projection angle of the index finger in the ipsilateral hand (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, fatigue induced increases in both the standard deviations of coordination angle and projection angle of both digits in the ipsilateral hand (p < 0.05). These results imply that the muscle fatigue could interfere with the grasping stability by altering the directional coordination of all the involved digits and the control of force directions for each individual digit. These findings provide insights into fatigue-related changes of force directional regulation and coordination in dexterous manipulation."
https://openalex.org/W2904172004,"To acquire a deeper understanding of malignant melanoma (MM), it is essential to study the proteome of patient tissues. In particular, phosphoproteomics of MM has become of significant importance because of the central role that phosphorylation plays in the development of MM. Investigating clinical samples, however, is an extremely challenging task as there is usually only very limited quantities of material available to perform targeted enrichment approaches. Here, an automated phosphopeptide enrichment protocol using the AssayMap Bravo platform was applied to MM tissues and assessed for performance. The strategy proved to be highly-sensitive, less prone to variability, less laborious than existing techniques and adequate for starting quantities at the microgram level. An Fe(III)-NTA-IMAC-based enrichment workflow was applied to a dilution series of MM tissue lysates. The workflow was efficient in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility and phosphosite localization; and from only 12.5 μg of sample, more than 1,000 phosphopeptides were identified. In addition, from 60 μg of protein material the number of identified phosphoproteins from individual MM samples was comparable to previous reports that used extensive fractionation methods. Our data set included key pathways that are involved in MM progression; such as MAPK, melanocyte development and integrin signaling. Moreover, tissue-specific immunological proteins were identified, that have not been previously observed in the proteome of MM-derived cell lines. In conclusion, this workflow is suitable to study large cohorts of clinical samples that demand automatic and careful handling."
https://openalex.org/W2904539025,"Objective In the workplace depression and suicide are serious mental health problems. A lack of knowledge and mental health skills along with the stigma toward mental health problems often results in delays in seeking professional help. Interventions targeting not only persons with mental health problems but also people around the individual are warranted in order to encourage supporting behavior within entire workplace. In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of our newly developed educational training program in the management with depression and suicidal risk in the workplace as a single-arm pilot trial. Methods The program is a two-hour (2-h) training course for employees based on the Mental Health First Aid (MHFA) program which aims to increase public mental health literacy. We conducted this program at a company workplace among 91 employees, and ultimately 83 participants completed the self-rated questionnaires. Changes in confidence and practical skills in early intervention of depression and suicide-prevention, and stigma toward mental health problems were evaluated using self-rated questionnaires at 3 time-points; pre-program, immediately post-program, and 1 month after the program. Results Confidence and practical skills were significantly improved even 1 month after the program, and stigma reduced just after the program. Conclusions Our pilot study suggests that the program has a positive impact on encouraging employees to support their co-workers with mental health problems, and is applicable for busy workers due to its short duration. A single-arm design, evaluation using self-rated questionnaire and short-term follow up period are the main limitations of the present study. Hence, future research is required to validate the effects of this program with control groups, and also to assess long-term effectiveness and objective changes such as absenteeism and sick leave.

The probabilistic linguistic preference relation (PLPR), which is applied to deal with complex decision-making problems, can be constructed for PLTSs. However, it is difficult for decision makers to provide the probabilities of occurrence for PLPR. To deal with this problem, we propose a definition of expected consistency for PLPR and establish a probability computing model to derive probabilities of occurrence in PLPR with priority weights for alternatives. A consistency-improving iterative algorithm is presented to examine whether or not the PLPR is at an acceptable consistency. Moreover, the consistency-improving iterative algorithm should obtain the satisfaction consistency level for the unacceptable consistency PLPR. Finally, a real-world employment-city selection is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method of deriving priority weights from PLPR."

Objective We assessed the regional variation in the use of VP/BKP in Switzerland. Methods We conducted a population-based small area variation analysis using patient discharge data for VP/BKP from all Swiss hospitals and Swiss census data for calendar years 2012/13. We derived hospital service areas (HSAs) by analyzing patient flows, assigning regions from which most residents were discharged to the same VP/BKP specific HSA. We calculated age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP-rates and measures of regional variation (extremal quotient [EQ], systematic component of variation [SCV]). We estimated the reduction in variation of VP/BKP rates using negative binomial regression, with adjustment for patient demographic and regional socioeconomic factors (socioeconomic status, urbanization, and language region). We considered the residual, unexplained variation most likely to be unwarranted. Results Overall, 4955 VP/BKPs were performed in Switzerland in 2012/13. The age-/sex-standardized mean VP/BKP rate was 4.6/10,000 persons and ranged from 1.0 to 10.1 across 26 HSAs. The EQ was 10.2 and the SCV 57.6, indicating a large variation across VP/BKP specific HSAs. After adjustment for demographic and socioeconomic factors, the total reduction in variance was 32.2% only, with the larger part of the variation remaining unexplained. Conclusions We found a 10-fold variation in VP/BKP rates across Swiss VP/BKP specific HSAs. As only one third of the variation was explained by differences in patient demographics and regional socioeconomic factors, VP/BKP in the highest-use areas may, at least partially, represent overtreatment."

Age-/sex-standardized asthma prevalence and health services use rates (2003-2013) were obtained from a provincial cohort of asthma patients. Employing an ecological-level study design, descriptive and Bayesian spatial regression analyses were used to examine patterns of asthma outcomes and their relationship to physical environment, socioeconomic environment and healthcare factors. Significant spatial variation in asthma outcomes was found between southern urban/suburban areas and northern/rural areas. Rurality was found to have a substantial effect on all asthma outcomes, except hospitalizations. For example, the most rural areas were associated with lower asthma prevalence and physician visits [RR = 0.708, 95% credible interval (CI): 0.636-0.795 and RR = 0.630, 95% CI: 0.504-0.758, respectively], and with higher ED visits (RR = 1.818, 95% CI: 1.194-2.858), when compared to urban areas. Strong associations were also found between material deprivation and ED visits (RR = 1.559, 95% CI: 1.358-1.737) and hospitalizations (RR = 1.259, 95% CI: 1.143-1.374). Associations between asthma outcomes and environmental variables such as air pollution and temperature were also found. Findings can be expected to inform the development of improved public health strategies, which take into account local environmental, socioeconomic and healthcare characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W2903821434,"Purpose 4D perfusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with intravenous injection of contrast agent allows for a radiation-free assessment of regional lung function. It is therefore a valuable method to monitor response to treatment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). This study was designed to evaluate its potential for monitoring short-term response to hyperoxia in COPD patients. Materials and methods 19 prospectively enrolled COPD patients (median age 66y) underwent paired dynamic contrast-enhanced 4D perfusion MRI within 35min, first breathing 100% oxygen (injection 1, O2) and then room air (injection 2, RA), which was repeated on two consecutive days (day 1 and 2). Post-processing software was employed to calculate mean transit time (MTT), pulmonary blood volume (PBV) and pulmonary blood flow (PBF), based on the indicator dilution theory, for the automatically segmented whole lung and 12 regions of equal volume. Results Comparing O2 with RA conditions, PBF and PBV were found to be significantly lower at O2, consistently on both days (p<10–8). Comparing day 2 to day 1, MTT was shorter by 0.59±0.63 s (p<10–8), PBF was higher by 22±80 ml/min/100ml (p<3·10–4), and PBV tended to be lower by 0.2±7.2 ml/100ml (p = 0.159) at both, RA and O2, conditions. Conclusion The second injection (RA) yielded higher PBF and PBV, which apparently contradicts the established hypothesis that hyperoxia increases lung perfusion. Quantification of 4D perfusion MRI by current software approaches may thus be limited by residual circulating contrast agent in the short-term and even the next day."

In this study, we perform comparative RNA sequencing analysis on zebrafish embryos during the stages of lateral plate mesoderm migration. This work shows that knockdown of the Tbx5 paralogues results in altered gene expression in many tissues outside of the lateral plate mesoderm, especially in the somitic mesoderm and the intermediate mesoderm. Specifically, knockdown of tbx5b results in changes in somite size, in the differentiation of vasculature progenitors and in later patterning of trunk blood vessels."
https://openalex.org/W2903975070,"Introduction Hearing loss substantially impacts pediatric development, and early identification improves outcomes. While intervening before school-entry is critical to optimize learning, early-childhood hearing screening practices are highly variable. Conditioned play audiometry (CPA) is the gold standard for preschool hearing screening, but otoacoustic emission (OAE) testing provides objective data that may improve screening outcomes. Objectives To compare outcomes of a community-based low-income preschool hearing program before and after implementation of OAE in a single-visit, two-tiered paradigm. We hypothesized that this intervention would reduce referral rates and improve follow-up while maintaining stable rates of diagnosed sensorineural hearing loss. Methods We performed a cohort study of 3257 children screened from July 2014-June 2016. Department of Public Health data were analyzed pre- and post-implementation of second-line OAE testing for children referred on CPA screening with targeted follow-up by DPH staff. Primary outcomes included referral rates, follow-up rates, and diagnosis of sensorineural hearing loss. Results Demographics, pure-tone pass rates, and incidence of newly-diagnosed permanent hearing loss were similar across years. After intervention, overall pass rates increased from 92% to 95% (P = 0.0014), while only 0.7% remained unable to be tested (P<0.0001). 5% of children were unable to be tested by CPA screening but passed OAE testing, obviating further evaluation. Referral rate decreased from 8% to 5% (P = 0.0014), and follow-up improved from 36% to 91% (P<0.0001). Identification of pathology in children with follow-up increased from 19% to over 50%. Further, disparities in pass rates and ability to test seen in Year 1 were eliminated in Year 2. Conclusion and relevance In a community setting, implementation of second-line OAE screening for CPA referrals reduced referral rates, increased identification of hearing loss, reduced outcome disparities, and improved follow-up rates. This study provides lessons in how to improve outcomes and reduce disparities in early-childhood hearing screening."
https://openalex.org/W2904316737,"The morphology and composition of tissue located within parietal shell canals of the barnacle Amphibalanus amphitrite are described. Longitudinal canal tissue nearly spans the length of side shell plates, terminating near the leading edge of the specimen basis in proximity to female reproductive tissue located throughout the peripheral sub-mantle region, i.e. mantle parenchyma. Microscopic examination of stained longitudinal canal sections reveal the presence of cell nuclei as well as an abundance of micron-sized spheroids staining positive for basic residues and lipids. Spheroids with the same staining profile are present extensively in ovarioles, particularly within oocytes which are readily identifiable at various developmental stages. Mass spectrometry analysis of longitudinal canal tissue compared to tissue collected from the mantle parenchyma reveals a nearly 50% overlap of the protein profile with the greatest number of sequence matches to vitellogenin, a glycolipoprotein playing a key role in vitellogenesis-yolk formation in developing oocytes. The morphological similarity and proximity to female reproductive tissue, combined with mass spectrometry of the two tissues, provides compelling evidence that one of several possible functions of longitudinal canal tissue is supporting the female reproductive system of A. amphitrite, thus expanding the understanding of the growth and development of this sessile marine organism."

Preclinical models have been shown to play an important role in unraveling the underlying mechanisms behind the metastatic process and evaluation of new therapeutic approaches. As the size of the rat brain allows improved in vivo imaging, we attempted to establish a rat model for breast cancer brain metastasis that allows follow-up by 7 tesla (7T) preclinical Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).Green fluorescent protein-transduced (eGFP) MDA-MB-231br breast cancer cells were labeled with micron-sized particles of iron oxide (MPIOs) and intracardially injected in the left ventricle of female nude rats and mice. 7T preclinical MRI was performed to show the initial distribution of MPIO-labeled cancer cells and to visualize metastasis in the brain. Occurrence of potential metastasis outside the brain was evaluated by 2-deoxy-2-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose ([18F]FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) and potential bone lesions were assessed using [18F]sodium fluoride ([18F]NaF) PET/CT.The first signs of brain metastasis development were visible as hyperintensities on T2-weighted (T2w) MR images acquired 3 weeks after intracardiac injection in rats and mice. Early formation of unexpected bone metastasis in rats was clinically observed and assessed using PET/CT. Almost no bone metastasis development was observed in mice after PET/CT evaluation.Our results suggest that the metastatic propensity of the MDA-MB-231br/eGFP cancer cell line outside the brain is species-dependent. Because of early and abundant formation of bone metastasis with the MDA-MB-231br/eGFP cancer cell line, this rat model is currently not suitable for investigating brain metastasis as a single disease model nor for evaluation of novel brain metastasis treatment strategies."

In this study we use single molecule fluorescence TIRF microscopy combined with a microfluidic device and fluorescently labelled proteins to measure Tpm1.1 association to and dissociation from single actin filaments. Our experimental setup allows us to clearly resolve Tpm1.1 interactions on both sides of the filaments. Here we provide a semi-automated method for the extraction and quantification of kymograph data for individual actin filaments bound at different Tpm1.1 concentrations. We determine boundaries on the kymograph on each side of the actin filament, based on intensity thresholding, performing fine manual editing of the boundaries (if needed) and extracting user defined kinetic properties of the system. Using our analytical tools we can determine (i) nucleation point(s) and rates, (ii) elongation rates of Tpm1.1, (iii) identify meeting points after the saturation of filament, and when dissociation occurs, (iv) initiation point(s), (v) the final dissociation point(s), as well as (vi) dissociation rates. All of these measurements can be extracted from both sides of the filament, allowing for the determination of possible differences in behaviour on the two sides of the filament, and across concentrations. The robust and repeatable nature of the method allows quantitative, semi-automated analyses to be made of large studies of acto-tropomyosin interactions, as well as for other actin binding proteins or filamentous structures, opening the way for dissection of the dynamics underlying these interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2904072913,"Text representation can map text into a vector space for subsequent use in numerical calculations and processing tasks. Word embedding is an important component of text representation. Most existing word embedding models focus on writing and utilize context, weight, dependency, morphology, etc., to optimize the training. However, from the linguistic point of view, spoken language is a more direct expression of semantics; writing has meaning only as a recording of spoken language. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of a pronunciation-enhanced word embedding model (PWE) that integrates speech information into training to fully apply the roles of both speech and writing to meaning. This paper uses the Chinese language, English language and Spanish language as examples and presents several models that integrate word pronunciation characteristics into word embedding. Word similarity and text classification experiments show that the PWE outperforms the baseline model that does not include speech information. Language is a storehouse of sound-images; therefore, the PWE can be applied to most languages."
https://openalex.org/W2905119442,"While the perception of sexual orientation in voices often relies on stereotypes, it is unclear whether speech stereotypes and accurate perceptions of sexual orientation are each based on acoustic cues common to speakers of a given group. We ask if the stereotypical belief, that members of the same sexual orientation group share similar acoustic patterns, is accurate to some degree. To address this issue, we are the first to use a novel voice morphing technique to create voice averages from voices that represent extremes of a given sexual orientation group either in terms of actual or perceived sexual orientation. Importantly, averaging preserves only those acoustic cues shared by the original speakers. 144 German listeners judged the sexual orientation of twelve natural-sounding sentence stimuli, each representing an average of five original utterances. Half of the averages were based on targets' self-ratings of sexual orientation: On a 7-point Kinsey-like scale, we selected targets who were most typical for a certain sexual orientation group according to their self-identifications. The other half were based on extreme ratings by others (i.e., on speech-related sexual-orientation stereotypes). Listeners judged sexual orientation from the voice averages with above-chance accuracy suggesting 1) that the perception of actual and stereotypical sexual orientation, respectively, are based on acoustic cues shared by speakers of the same group, and 2) that the stereotypical belief that members of the same sexual orientation group share similar acoustic patterns is accurate to some degree. Mean fundamental frequency and other common acoustic parameters showed systematic variation depending on speaker gender and sexual orientation. Effects of sexual orientation were more pronounced for stereotypical voice averages than for those based on speakers' self-ratings, suggesting that sexual-orientation stereotypes exaggerate even those differences present in the most salient groups of speakers. Implications of our findings for stereotyping and discrimination are discussed."

The phylogenetic characterization of the sequenced VP1 region of Echovirus18 (E18) and Coxsackievirus B5 (CVB5) isolated in Palestine along with 27 E18 and 27 CVB5 sequences available from the Genbank were described.E18 and CVB5 account for 50% and 35% of the successfully HEV types, respectively. Phylogenetic tree of E18 and CVB5 showed three main clusters, with all Palestinian isolates uniquely clustering together with those from China and from different countries, respectively. Cluster I of E18, with 13 Palestinian and 6 Chinese isolates, showed the lowest haplotype-to-sequence ratio (0.6:1), haplotype diversity (Hd), nucleotide diversity (π), and number of segregating sites (S) compared to clusters II and III. Furthermore, cluster I showed negative Tajima's D and Fu-Li'sF tests with statistically significant departure from neutrality (P<0.01). In both E18 and CVB5 populations, high haplotype diversity, but low genetic diversity was evident. Inter-population pairwise genetic distance (Fst) and gene flow (Nm) showed that the Palestinian E18 and CVB5 clusters were highly differentiated from the other clusters.The study divulged close genetic relationship between Palestinian HEV strains as confirmed by population genetics and phylogenetic analyses."
https://openalex.org/W2904459981,"The endangered Cedrela balansae C.DC. (Meliaceae) is a high-value timber species with great potential for forest plantations that inhabits the tropical forests in Northwestern Argentina.Research on this species is scarce because of the limited genetic and genomic information available. Here, we explored the transcriptome of C. balansae using 454 GS FLX Titanium next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Following de novo assembling, we identified 27,111 non-redundant unigenes longer than 200 bp, and considered these transcripts for further downstream analysis. The functional annotation was performed searching the 27,111 unigenes against the NR-Protein and the Interproscan databases. This analysis revealed 26,977 genes with homology in at least one of the Database analyzed. Furthermore, 7,774 unigenes in 142 different active biological pathways in C. balansae were identified with the KEGG database. Moreover, after in silico analyses, we detected 2,663 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. A subset of 70 SSRs related to important ""stress tolerance"" traits based on functional annotation evidence, were selected for wet PCR-validation in C. balansae and other Cedrela species inhabiting in northwest and northeast of Argentina (C. fissilis, C. saltensis and C. angustifolia). Successful transferability was between 77% and 93% and thanks to this study, 32 polymorphic functional SSRs for all analyzed Cedrela species are now available. The gene catalog and molecular markers obtained here represent a starting point for further research, which will assist genetic breeding programs in the Cedrela genus and will contribute to identifying key populations for its preservation."
https://openalex.org/W2904585268,"Asking unanticipated questions in investigative interviews can elicit differences in the verbal behaviour of truth-tellers and liars: When faced with unanticipated questions, liars give less detailed and consistent responses than truth-tellers. Do such differences in verbal behaviour lead to an improvement in the accuracy of interviewers’ veracity judgements? Two empirical studies evaluated the efficacy of the unanticipated questions technique. Experiment 1 compared two types of unanticipated questions (questions regarding the planning of a task and questions regarding the specific spatial and temporal details associated with the task), assessing the veracity judgements of interviewers and verbal content of interviewees’ responses. Experiment 2 assessed veracity judgements of independent observers. Overall, the results provide little support for the technique. For interviewers, unanticipated questions failed to improve veracity judgement accuracy above chance. Reality monitoring analysis revealed qualitatively distinct information in the responses to the two unanticipated question types, though little distinction between the responses of truth-tellers and liars. Accuracy for observers was greater when judging transcripts of unanticipated questions, and this effect was stronger for spatial and temporal questions than planning questions. The benefits of unanticipated questioning appear limited to post-interview situations. Furthermore, the type of unanticipated question affects both the type of information gathered and the ability to detect deceit."
https://openalex.org/W2904756941,"Background/Objectives Regular exercise training is effective to altering many markers of metabolic syndrome and its effects are strongly influenced by the type of consumed diet. Nowadays, resistance training (RT) has been frequently associated with low-carbohydrate high-fat diet (LCD). After long term these diets causes body weight (BW) regain with deleterious effects on body composition and metabolic risk factors. The effects of RT associated with long-term LCD on these parameters remain unexplored. We aimed to investigate the effects of RT when associated with long-term LCD on BW, feed efficiency, body composition, glucose homeostasis, liver parameters and serum biochemical parameters during BW regain period in rats. Subjects/Methods Male Sprague–Dawley rats were fed with LCD (LC groups) or standard diet (STD) (ST groups). After 10 weeks-diet animals were separated into sedentary (Sed-LC and Sed-ST) and resistance-trained (RT-LC and RT-ST) groups (N = 8/group). RT groups performed an 11-week climbing program on a ladder with progressive load. Dual x-ray absorptiometry, glucose tolerance tests and insulin tolerance tests were performed at weeks 10 and 20. Liver and serum were collected at week 21. Results RT reduced feed efficiency, BW gain, liver fat and total and LDL cholesterol, and improved body composition and glucose clearance in animals fed on STD. In those fed with LCD, RT reduced caloric intake, BW regain, liver fat and serum triglycerides levels. However, improvement in body composition was inhibited and bone mineral density and glucose clearance was further impaired in this association. Conclusions The LCD nullifies the beneficial effects of RT on body composition, glucose homeostasis and impairs some health parameters. Our results do not support the association of RT with LCD in a long term period."
https://openalex.org/W2903899221,"The New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) is a universal healthcare coverage plan now covering over 98% of rural residents in China, first implemented in 2003. Rising costs in the face of modest gains in health and financial protections have raised questions about the cost-effectiveness of the NCMS.Using the most recent estimates of the NCMS's health and economic consequences from a comprehensive review of the literature, we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model for a hypothetical cohort between ages 20 and 100. We then did one-way sensitivity analyses and a probabilistic sensitivity analysis using Monte Carlo simulations to explore whether the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) falls below 37,059 international dollars [Int$], the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of three times per capita GDP of China in 2013.The ICER of the NCMS over the lifetime of an average 20-year-old rural resident in China was about Int$71,480 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained (95% confidence interval: cost-saving, Int$845,659/QALY). There was less than a 33% chance that the system was cost-saving or met the WTP threshold. However, the NCMS did fall under the threshold when changes in the program costs, the risk of mortality and hypertension, and the likelihood of labor force participation were tested in one-way sensitivity analyses.The NCMS appears to be economically inefficient in its current form. Further cost-effectiveness analyses are warranted in designing insurance benefit packages to ensure that the NCMS fund goes toward health care that has a good value in improving survival and quality of life."
https://openalex.org/W2904958141,"Objectives The aim was to gain knowledge regarding the risk of perinatal death related to exposure to dental amalgam fillings in the mother. Design Population-based observational cohort study. Setting The Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study, a Norwegian birth cohort of children born in 1999–2008 conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Participants 72,038 pregnant women with data on the number of teeth filled with dental amalgam. Main outcome measures Data on perinatal death (stillbirth ≥ 22 weeks plus early neonatal death 0–7 days after birth) were obtained from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. Results The absolute risk of perinatal death ranged from 0.20% in women with no amalgam-filled teeth to 0.67% in women with 13 or more teeth filled with amalgam. Analyses including the number of teeth filled with amalgam as a continuous variable indicated an increased risk of perinatal death by increasing number of teeth filled with dental amalgam (crude OR 1.065, 95% CI 1.034 to 1.098, p<0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders (mothers' age, education, body mass index, parity, smoking during pregnancy, alcohol consumption during pregnancy) included as categorical variables, there was still an increased risk for perinatal death associated with increasing number of teeth filled with amalgam (ORadj 1.041, 95% CI 1.008 to 1.076, p = 0.015). By an increased exposure from 0 to 16 teeth filled with amalgam, the model predicted an almost doubled odds ratio (ORadj 1.915, 95% CI 1.12 to 3.28). In groups with 1 to 12 teeth filled with amalgam the adjusted odds ratios were slightly, but not significantly, increased. The group with the highest exposure (participants with 13 or more teeth filled with amalgam) had an adjusted OR of 2.34 (95% CI 1.27 to 4.32; p = 0.007). Conclusion The current findings suggest that the risk of perinatal death could increase in a dose-dependent way based on the mother’s number of teeth filled with dental amalgam. However, we cannot exclude that the relatively modest odds ratios could be a result of residual confounding. Additional studies on the relationship between exposure to dental amalgam fillings during pregnancy and perinatal death are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2903612039,"To investigate the effects of etomidate, emulsified isoflurane, and their combination with dexmedetomidine on physiological parameters, electrocardiogram (ECG) results, and the quality of induction and recovery during isoflurane maintenance anaesthesia. 5 mixed-breed dogs received each of four treatments: etomidate (E group); emulsified isoflurane (EI group); both dexmedetomidine and etomidate (DE group); or both dexmedetomidine and emulsified isoflurane (DEI group). All drugs were IV injection administered for induction, followed by 1.5 MAC (minimal alveolar concentration) of isoflurane to maintain anaesthesia. Rectal temperature (RT), respiratory rate (RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and ECG were measured at baseline, 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 60 minutes after intubation. The quality of induction and recovery was evaluated for all dogs. All the anaesthetic procedures provided good conditions for induction of anaesthesia. The quality of induction and recovery in the E group was worse than other groups. The decrease of RR in the E and DE groups was stronger than that in the EI and DEI groups. The dogs in the E group had the most significant prolongation of the Q-T interval and changes in the S-T segment. Deviation and extension of the S-T segment were noted in the El group. The dogs in the DE and DEI groups had fewer changes in the ECG results than those in the E and EI groups. The addition of dexmedetomidine caused less effect on cardiopulmonary parameters and the ECG results than either etomidate or emulsified isoflurane alone. Thus, etomidate or emulsified isoflurane in combination with dexmedetomidine may be useful clinically for the induction of anaesthesia."
